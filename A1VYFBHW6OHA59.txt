(4.5stars)Conscious Voice is easily Junior Kelly's best work since Juvenile and its dubbed out counterpart. Simply put, there are no bad tracks here and the underrated singjay rules it throughout the album. My simple critique of Junior Kelly has always been his lyrical content, he has (usually) a problem with consistency, meaning that you can clearly see that he has the ability to do much better than he does, but on Conscious Voice, he leaves very little room for improvement. My favorite track here is without a doubt the beautiful God Bless, which reminds me a little of Kalonji's awesome &quot;The World&quot; from Bobo Ashanti. Speaking of Sizzla that is exactly the level that Junior Kelly attains with this one. Also check Push a Fire, Dem Shoulda Know, What a Worries and its remix, and Them and Those. Also interesting here is the hip-hop treatment given to Kelly's biggest hit to date Love So Nice, I'm not saying its great, but its very interesting to hear. And by the way feel Jah Live On and Come One Day, but as I've said there are no weak songs here, just hits and Kelly runs it amazingly well.

(3.5 stars)This is the second year inna row that I've bought the Gold album and this is the second year inna row that it's been a slightly better than average project. The bottom line here is that there are some very very good songs here, and some flat awful songs here that just sort of cancel each other out. The worst of worse has to be Elephant Man's Shizzle Ma Nizzle, which, to me, has to lyrically be one of the worse modern dancehall cuts I've ever heard, no matter the riddim (here on the liquid). Also, Lexxus and Vegas on Video Light, which is just a collaboration that should not have happened. Bun Out the Chi Chi is also not one of Capleton's best either (and edited). And Terry Linen, who CAN SING, but enough with the remakes of hip-hop songs already, as The World Greatest is merely R.Kelly's exact same song.The album improves drastically after the first 7 songs, as it begins the lover's rock section, the best being Come Down Father by Beres Hammond and Never Go Where Pagans Go, by Warrior King which isn't as good as his hit Virtuous Woman (nothing to be ashamed of).After that it goes back to dancehall (and good dancehall). Two legends make their comebacks thoroughly here. Professional hit-maker Shabba Ranks, absolutely Kills it on Pretty Please and the Empress getting ready for her album, Lady Saw shows maybe her best lyrics since Sycamore Tree on the outstanding Baddest Girl. Throw in a decent Bounty track Killa is Ah Killa and a GOOD song by Prophet &amp; Luciano from Still Blazin' and its rounded out nicely.My favorite track (besides Saw's Baddest Girl) is oddly enough, Old Crook by the unknown Mister G, because of that old-school dancehall sounding riddim, and Mister G offers up some decent lyrics. Also pretty odd is the song Middle Fingers in the Air by Baby Cham. The lyrics on that one are pretty bad, however, its the first time that the riddim, the Return has been on CD and it sounds amazing, VP should've pulled the tune The Return also by Cham as a better representative of the riddim.Overall, its a pretty fun album I would suggest that R&amp;B and hip-hop fans pick this one up, its a pretty tame, easily english understood record. Dancehall and Lover's Rock fans stick to Strictly the Best and what Greensleeves puts out. By the way the second cd is even wacker than last year's as Jazzy T's too much talkling soundstyle ruins it like so many others he has done. And di gyal pon di cover ah murdah.

Album editing is a terrible terrible thing. Sometimes it can lead to an amazing song sounding horrible (i.e. Capleton Pure Sodom version on More Fire) and on Thug Nature it reigns supreme. Songs like the opener Coochie Daddy and Buck a Catty are nearly destroyed by the record company's torrid display of editing. However, if you set the editing aside, which is terribly difficult to do, you end up with a pretty good record from the now veteran Spragga. Apparently Spragga set out to make a straight head knocking dancehall album, and he succeeded in doing just that. Check out &quot;Analogy&quot; on the Superstar, also used by the following track &quot;Bait&quot;, &quot;Stunna&quot; and &quot;Di Rooster&quot;. My personal favorite is &quot;Playa&quot; with one of the wickedest rhythms I've heard in a long time. Overall, if you can get past the editing its a very good album, definitely worth buying if you're a Benz fan, or maybe if you're a hip-hop fan that is starting to listen to dancehall.

If you ever stop and take a look at the list of talents in reggae music that are coming from areas in the Caribbean outside of Jamaica, you will find yourself terribly impressed. Definitely check the boys at I-Grade Records, nearly all of the talents that they produce are top notch out of the Virgin Islands (particularly St. Croix). Then there are other talents such as the excellent Queen Omega from Trinidad, Nasio from Dominica, the best current roots band on the scene Midnite, Bambu Station and other more established acts in JA such as Natural Black from Guyana. And further up and coming acts such as NiyoRah and Marlon Asher.The young Delyno Brown, aka Pressure, from St Thomas fits right into that group. Pressure is a member of the Star Lion Family from St Thomas (which includes the aforementioned NiyoRah as well), which is a group of impressive young roots talent, Pressure being the most impressive. His style is most similar to JA chanters such as Sizzla and Turbulence and he fits right into that family as well, even in terms of skills, his lyrical ability is magnificent.His debut album, which was the first I had ever heard of the artist is one of the most impressive reggae debuts I have EVER heard in all the years that I've been listening to the music. Probably the best tune here is the awesome one drop of Zion Is Home. Lyrically the tune is nearly perfect and he rides the solid one drop spectacularly. Also check the only combination here, a big tune featuring vet JA singer Glen Washington on When Dem Come. The obligatory mama tune, fittingly titled Mama, is a big tune, as well as the agressive Buss Dem Brain. Also check I Tried (which sounds like it rides a riddim which could be right out of Tuff Gong) and the closer No Limitation which ends the album on a big beautiful vibrant note.Overall, definitely check this hard to find gem. I was definitely surprised to see it selling on Amazon, if you can find it at all, you'll be over-joyed with the results. I wish they could take Pressure to Jamaica and see what the results might be were he to hook up with such producers as Bobby Digital, Calibud, Fattis and Vendetta, believe me, the artist is that crucial. When you start to look at reggae outside of Jamaica, make sure that at the top of your list is Pressure.AMAZING!

In terms of albums, it hasn't been very long since Cocoa Tea released one. 2004 saw him riding the biggest hit of his career to an album of the same name on Tek Weh Yuh Gyal, he returns, just 2 years later (short time for him, long time for most of reggae) with this album, Save Us Oh Jah, produced by the legendary Phillip Fattis Burrell's Xterminator camp.Tea himself coproduces Save Us Oh Jah with Burrell and the results are no less than exactly what you might expect, with a more of a laid back tempo than the rather jovial approach evident on the Tek Weh Yuh Gyal album. This album is much more vibes driven rather than the obligatory hit the dancefloor stylee.All that being said, the best tune on this album is about as close to a dance song as there is on the album. Spin the Song Ya is an AMAZING record and I defy any reggae fan to listen the song and not feel that huge vibe coming from it, so so easy. The title track here is big as well. There's actually a short stretch of music here, from the title track through Let the Music Play (a song about being on tour with Capleton for 2 years and record with Capleton's bnd PROPHECY) and Indian Woman which is one of the coolest records on the album altogether.Also check Don't Give Your Love Away ad Biological Clock which is a love song so cool that I have been meditating on it since I got the album, just a really really cool tune that could probably only work sung by Cocoa Tea.Cocoa Tea's vocals are top notch throughout and he doesn't seem to be showing any strain despite being at the top of his game for all these years, I could have seen him singing most of these songs a decade and a half ago easily.Overall, I've yet to hear much material from Tea that didn't meet my standard of aproval, Save Us Oh Jah is no different at all and may be without the big flare, but is one of Cocoa Tea's most consistently good albums to date.

If you know who Silver Cat is and you're not a dancehall nut, you probably caught a Beenie Man show and remember the Cat as the overwhelmingly loud and overanimated opening act who left the stage and had the audience begging for more.Silver Cat made a name for himself with the same Shocking Vibes crew that Beenie did. While Beenie was the straightforward dancehall superstar, the Cat fell rather comfortably into the mold of the standard mid to late 90's dj who either never had the big hit, or never had the big followup hit. Yet, while many of his peers in that respect such as Merciless, Mega Banton and Terror Fabulous are now more likely to show up on the back of a milk carton than a stage show, the Cat is rather easily found, constantly touring with Beenie Man.This album, In a Foul Affair, his debut and only to date is a lesson in everything about what is good about the Cat. You love his overanimated commitment to his craft, and although it was released 10 years ago, update the riddims and what Silver Cat is today still resonates through Foul Affair.The best tune here is without a doubt Dead in Yah. The song shows the Cat's strength to the fullest and goes back to the time where a dj's first order of business after hitting the top-flight was to show and tell all the other dj's just how bad he was. Also love the opener, I Know When, which takes care of the dj's second order of business which was to show and tell all the other dj's just how many women he had! Also, check Van Damme with Beenie Man (reminiscent of Merciless' Mavis tune) the title track, Dionne and the creative The Bride. And my second favorite tune, Gal Pickney.Overall, you have to really enjoy dancehall (particularly from the mid 90's period) to appreciate In a Foul Affair. It is about as complete of a dancehall album as you'll find this side of Sean Paul's debut album. Yes, there wasn't much distinguishing many of the artist's from the mid 90's, Silver Cat included, but put on a stage alone (just as he does literally) Silver Cat always shines.

Should you ever find yourself seeking a really really mellow reggae vibe, eight times out of ten I'll probably recommend that you seek out the latest Luciano release. Those other two times I'll suggest you take the route that I've been doing for the past year or so and check out a Batch release. Batch is one of the preeminent producers and ever developing artists coming out of the Virgin Island reggae scene and briefly being based in the States (in the very reggae heavy Virginia I believe, to my knowledge he has since returned operations to St. Croix) Batch continues to spread his heavy, yet very smooth blend of reggae music through his label Sound Vizion Records. Having originally made his name as a virtual utility musician, playing a variety of instruments for a variety of very well known artists including some Jamaica's finest roots and dancehall talents, Batch is now very known and respected for not only his own music, but having done production work for some of the finest talents in the Virgin Islands (and I'm just waiting until an artist from Jamaica, especially Lutan Fyah, makes his way to Batch's studio). Batch has even done production work for the Midnite band (on the He is Jah album), the dominant name of the Virgin Island reggae scene and has pushed his name alongside the most respected production and musician names of the genre such as Tuff Lion, Laurent `Tippy' Alfred, Ronnie Benjamin and Dean Pond. All the big producers have definitely their own style; while often times the VI reggae sound is categorized by many (including myself sometimes) to be like the old school Jamaican sound just before the digital dominance began, it isn't always a fair comparison on categorization as the genre continues to develop nearly daily. The brilliant Tuff Lion for instance (and check his debut album, Utterance, as well) is most noted for his guitar works and thus his productions (which occurs largely with Laurent Alfred) reflects that; while with Alfred himself, he seems to take his compositions in a variety of directions, encompassing both that ultra heavy, old school vibe as well as, at times, that large anthem sound of today's roots for his label, I-Grade Records; Dean Pond, most noted for working with veteran St. Croix singer Army and doing lead production for the debut of Pressure Busspipe, The Pressure is On, but also having a basis which began with Midnite production as well as works for other artists, almost exclusively has that large sound of `neo-roots' reggae. Ronnie Benjamin's production style is almost completely the very heavy and mellow old school sound which blends perfectly with the style of ultra roots music his band, Midnite, makes. Batch's style is closer to Benjamin's style with a touch of Dean Pond and others. Could you take somehow take Batch back to 1960's-1970's Jamaica, today he would probably be a household name in reggae music.His own works have lead to the creation of his label which most notably has served as a launching pad for one of the future (and arguably current) superstars of the genre, Ras Attitude. The connection between the two artists has proven to be quite successful, Batch's Sound Vizion has, to date, released two albums (his debut Happiness and the very solid Love Life) from Attitude, and as his base has also pushed him into very successful ventures with other producers all over the world (I recently saw a video for a Ras Attitude song played here in Jamaica!). Credit goes to Attitude definitely for encouraging the previously almost exclusive studio and instrumental performing Batch to take the front stage more and more and actually produce for himself. The result has been a very respectable run of now five albums (the fifth is I-Ver Strong which I'm currently listing to), four of which were produced by Batch (the new one was not) and three of which saw their exclusive release on his own Sound Vizion label. I'm anticipating that someday the two will actually be releasing an album together, that album will undoubtedly be one of the most substantial pieces for the genre to date. Batch has also done production work on his label for Mada Nile, a very nice chanter from out of St. Croix as well (check out her new album on Sound Vizion, Many Roads), his `secret weapon' the developing Ahfyah and others such Masta Chang, Shepard, fellow producer Ras L and even Ima, Batch's wife (who plays a very prominent role on this album, as a background singer, although wonderfully credited as a `front ground` vocalist). I've always maintained that Batch's production work is undoubtedly where his true success lies, I hope someday Sound Vizion grows to the size of Alfred's I-Grade label thus giving Batch the opportunity the opportunity to work with nearly every sensational young roots talent from out of the VI scene, but his talents on the mic are definitely not to be overlooked. While Ras Attitude often times comes off as the supremely talented wordsmith capable of adopting almost any style while still seemingly (at least these days) being entirely more comfortable as a singer, Batch, on the other hand is almost a pure chanter. His style of chanting, however does involve a great deal of singing and he basically veers between the two styles at such a rate that they both, combined, actually BECOME his style. I liken him to an overall more vocally talented version of Vaughn Benjamin, lead singer of Midnite (although certainly not as talented with the word as that lyrics machine, but very respectable still) and perhaps even more closely related vocally to a lite version of Bambu Station lead singer Jalani Horton (minus the occasional volcanic outbursts which make Horton's style so very unique to him). And the good thing about Batch, the artist, is that he obviously continues to grow, on one of his most recent albums, To the Root, he displayed a much more melodically nice vibe which wasn't present on his previous work, Jah Guidance (although that album STILL stands as musically, in my opinion, his greatest piece to date).Besides To the Root, I-ver Strong and Jah Guidance, his three most recent pieces, there was the beginning with Who You Are, which really got the international buzz going about him as an artist, becoming one of the most popular underground pieces in the brief history of the VI reggae genre and then Keep the Faith. Keep the Faith didn't exactly attract much of the same attention as Who You Are (which I took an extraordinarily long and dumb time in picking up) but purely from a musical standpoint stands in very fine comparison to that album just a year before.Checking in at a very healthy seventeen tracks and featuring no official combinations, Keep the Faith is an excellent showcase of Batch's overall musical game. It is, for the most part a heavier vibe (which he himself attributes to having had more experience at the point) and an album which definitely requires a several listens to truly appreciate. Keep the Faith is just, in its simplest form, knowledge, you can literally learn something about yourself listening to it, and its all delivered in that typical laid back, Batch style which is just doing wonders or me these days. The album opens with Leave Out of Babylon a very solid repatriation anthem which Batch is very good at writing (also is devastatingly proficient at the herbalist tune as well). The song isn't too dissimilar lyrically to a track which appeared on the To the Root album, Carry Beyond. Batch can write a repatriation vibe that just makes you want to pack up everything, get your family and head Black to Afrika at that MINUTE, all done in a very mellow style, just a nice inspiring vibes. The aforementioned herbalist tune (which is also a nice penchant Luciano) comes in the form of early track Tree of Life. Batch's method of writing these types of tune is almost a praising vibe where you almost personify or in some cases even deify the herb itself, focusing more on the positive aspects of it (which is his style with almost everything), rather than taking the road used by so many in defending it. Tree of Life is no different and it stands as one of the more interesting songs on Keep the Faith and if you are an enjoyer of the herb, definitely a song you would be interested in hearing. Sons & Daughters is just a compete praise His Imperial Majesty and HIS followers from all walks of life and one of the best tracks you will probably hear Batch voice (my two favorite Batch tunes remain Ah Rulah from the Who You Are album and Hail the King from the To the Root album). Later on in Keep the Faith is a very interesting song Reaching. Reaching speaks on many of the trivial and inconsequential things which have arisen to divide Afrikan people. While definitely not his greatest creation musically (its built over a riddim which is pretty much all over the place), you definitely need to hear the lyrical vibe poured into the message on Reaching , definitely a must hear for fans of Batch and others as well. Check Justice. Justice is a quietly aggressive of all the struggles Afrikan men and women face in the world and its just a lovely done song over a riddim done so minimally but one which certainly is one of the most powerful on the album altogether.My absolute favorite tune on Keep the Faith is the title track (I don't think that happens very often at all). Keep the Faith, the song, is an excellently done challenge to those in the struggle to maintain and `keep the faith' for the reward for doing such will be great. While not an official combination, his wife, Ima, compliments her husband very well adding vocals throughout and while she appears on several tracks (and on some in slightly more prominent roles)(check Jah Run Things) Keep the Faith is undoubtedly her highlight as she voices the wonderful twenty five second long intro to the track and continues to hold a high vibe throughout. Another tune here which stands out to a very high case is the wicked wicked Sane Cry. While you could never describe Batch's musical style as even bordering near anywhere dancehall, Sane Cry is about as close as he gets to that vibe, even almost getting to something which gives a semblance of a DJ style on the tune. Sane Cry is Keep the Faith's changeup, a nice mix of the vibes and what you're used to from Batch into something different which is definitely worth listening to. One of the other real standouts on Keep the Faith (there are four altogether) is the tune When. When is an admonishment to those in society who have lost their way and not living in a positive way or in a selfish way. Its done over one of the best riddims you'll hear out of the Sound Vizion camp, I recognized it almost immediately as the tune which backed Ras Attitude brilliant War to Win, from the Love Life album, the riddim is such a heavy heavy one drop which absolutely serves perfectly as a showcase for Batch's talents as a producer and simultaneously, an excellent backdrop for one of his finer tunes as a vocalist. The final truly big track on Keep the Faith is the closer, the To the East instrumental. To the East is the name of the riddim which backs the aforementioned tune When and its almost a reward to the fans. You hear that wonderful riddim and its almost not even a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact: The To the East is a beautiful riddim. The decision to include it as the final track on Keep the Faith was a wonderful idea and one that truly strengthens the album overall.Another nice spot of tracks I have to mention on Keep the Faith comes just before the very solid ending tracks. Check Zion Kingdom Come which is a lovely song speaking not only the wonders of Zion itself, but the wonders of seeking Zion as well; check the song for the Empresses, the lovely Good Virtues, very nice track for the Black Queens and men who treat their Queens like such; and lastly I'll mention Full Circle which sounds like something snatched out of 1960's Jamaica, I was expecting to hear Alton Ellis chime in after the very nice beginning, but Batch does a very respectable job with the vibe.Overall, I'm recommending taking undoubtedly long road it would take to find this very hard to find gem (although, shockingly, you can RIGHT NOW purchase it on Amazon) to the more experienced and initiated roots fans. Newer fans, I think you may find Batch's newer and extremely more accessible (both musically and actually finding the albums) material. When considering that along with recording and producing this massive album, he was also recording and producing Ras Attitude's Love Life album as well as Mada Nile's debut album, Rise Today simultaneously. While all the productions were definitely similar, they shared very little in the way of actual production and riddims. Batch is to be commended for that along. Also commend him for the very nice album that is Keep the Faith, a very nice and mature roots album for the well versed and experienced roots fan.

As a fan of pure new school r&amp;b I wasn't expetcing too much here, the only reason that I got was because I was loving the first single and I couldn't find it anywhere. If you love smooth singing and interesting beats, then you'll probably do good by buying Syleena Johnson's record, she's got some pipes on her that could put you at ease in any situation. Besides I am Your Woman, my favorite tracks are You Said with Liberty City, He's Gonna Do You In, which is almost funny and You Ain't Right, one or two more &quot;happy&quot; songs would've done this record better, you'll feel like crying in the middle of it.

Tracklist:Like Glue- Sean PaulHigher Level- Elephant ManSufferah- Bounty KillerWah Dat Fah- Baby ChamPress Trigger- Mad CobraTek It Off- CapletonMoney- Tanto Metro &amp; DevonteParty Time- Wayne MarshallTra La La- Buju BantonTallup Tallup- Elephant ManGungu Walk- WickermanFitness- Bounty Killer feat. Angel DoolasWe Thugging Wayne Marshall &amp; Elephant ManHow It Ago- CapletonCome On- SizzlaJah Is Always There- Warrior King(3.5stars)There is a problem with this record, much the same problem that it had on last year's version. The problem is that if you are a deep listening, dancehall reggae nut, you already know all these tunes, and may even own most of them as singles already. However, if you are not an aforementioned dancehall nut, then this record might just be perfect for you. The dancehall version of Strictly the Best this year has alot of the favorite artists going today including Sean Paul, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, Capleton, Sizzla, and Mad Cobra. And the tunes they pulled from the artists are arguably their biggest tunes of the year; Sufferah from Bounty Killer, Press Trigger from the snake and Tallup Tallup from Elephant Man. My favorites on the record are Sufferah of course, Wah Dat Fa by the underappreciated Baby Cham, very good tune and How It Ago by the fire man. My absolute favorite tune here however, is Fitness, by Bounty Killer and Angel Doolas, very slack tune, but just a really good, dark sounding tune. Capleton and Sizzla also both go the slack route with Tek It Off and Come On respectively (Sizzla not so much so as Capleton, but Come On is a really crazy sounding tune. I also like Highet Level by Elephant Man. The last track which is very out of place here is Jah is Always There by Warrior King, which VPRecords obviously put on this one to promote Warrior King's new record, Virtuous Woman, (which is awesome by the way)and it is a great track, but like i said much out of place. Overall, like i said, if you aren't too familiar with Dancehall this year, then by all means get this one, its a very good sounding album. Only complaint to VP, no Beenie Man? No woman DJ?

There is absolutely no reason to buy this album. I consider myself a moderate fan of Mad Cobra's, the faster he goes, the better he is, but this album is just. . . I don't know, something is wrong with it. There is a song called Big Long John which is certainly nothing special, and then there is the remix, Mo' Big Long John. Hello! Why remix a bad song, the remix is worse. Ninja Man's verse on Sting Night is horrible, and I need not say anything else on that one. If buy some horrible tragedy, you should happen to encounter this, turn and run immediately.

The debate of great dancehall producers must begin with one name. King Jammy. The King of the Dancehall, has ruled the dancehall since the early 80's shift to the ragga/digital style, and to this day is one of the (if not the most) most influential men in all of the dancehall.So VP Records did a very nice thing in producing this 'project', with 20 strong of the legendary producer's finest and most crucial works and a wonderfully done, nearly hour long, dvd accompanying it. While you can find several well done compilations from the early digital ragga era of the dancehall (particularly Greensleeves The Biggest Dancehall Anthems 1979-82), this is the first that I know of the sort of following just the path of one superproducer, and the producer whom they chose may just be the definition of the term, 'superproducer'.I can't go on and tell you, like normally, what I might think the 'best' tune here, however, without a doubt my favorite is Wayne Smith's immortal Under Mi Sleng Teng over the equally immortal sleng teng riddim. Then you get into the classics such as John Holt's If I Were a Carpenter, the song so wicked it can make beautiful women dance with ugly man! Of course Junior Reid doing the 'jamrock' riddim with Boom-Shack-A-Lack and doing double duties as the frontman of Black Uhuru on I Love King Selassie.You also get Admiral Bailey's MASSIVE hit Punani, smooth Johnny Osbourne's Water Pumping, Frankie Paul's smooth smooth I Know The Score, Nitty Gritty Run Down the World. You can go on and on, every song here is a classic and that's exactly why its on this cd.Another thing you get from a more modern look; Many of the riddims here that you may not have been aware were actually Jammy's riddims you get to see the initial hit from them as it is now more and more propular to revive a classic riddim.But that's only the half of it.Also included here is a wonderful DVD with interviews with Jammy's his co-producer, Johnny Wonder and many others, including Ninja Man. Ninja gets into a rather funny 'clash' with Bunny General right in front of Jammy's studio and you get a really interesting look at the very very rich old man still recording JA's finest in one of the most violent ghettos in all of JA, with absolutely no intention of leaving. You get rare glimpses and interviews with individuals such as Tupps, Jammy's selector who had achieved a near mythical mysterious reputation when I was coming up, you watch him as he ever so quietly and carefully work. And you get alot of the King's peers and protoge's talking of the man and his work and MANY of the artists who voiced for him, from Josey Wales to Elephant Man; his peers such as Bobby Digital and Black Scorpio (and nice footage of their clash) and even his wife, the documentary is every bit as good as the cd.Overall, every dancehall producer from now on out will owe a debt of gratitude to Jammy. Some of the younger and reigning producers of today such as (older)Dave Kelly, Lenky and Vendetta are definitely doing a good job holding it down, but even today King Jammy's work comes with a bit of an edge on the competition, just by virtue of having his logo. Definitely check this one out, for not only good music, but the historical side to the vibes. VERY WELL DONE!

Bounty Killer is probably what I would call the best representation of a one and half dimensional artist. Meaning, he has something that he does really, really good and everything else, he's just okay at. And he has a much easier time representing himself as the Warlord than as the Poor People's Govenor. And on his latest project, the 2 installation Ghetto Dictionary he shows it completely. On the Art of War, the other installation, he flows brilliantly, within the confines of dancehall music, and does what he does best. Not trying to call him a one trick pony, but The Mystery at times sounds very stiff and he rides riddims that he has a little trouble with, usually the slower, more old-school dancehall oriented tracks (i.e. Pot of Gold, Gunz in the Ghetto, We Need a Leader, Petty Thief, Outcry, and the title track). Oddly enough, one of the finest moments, in my opinion on this packed album is the Bakardi Slang Refix(it really is a refix as the original needed help) with Kardinal Offishall. The ultra tight Sufferah with Wayne Marshall, is an example of why Bounty Killer can keep his hat in the overall reggae game and not just be a battlebot. Also check the hit Arrow. My favorite track here is Eyewater (formerly Water From Mi Eyes), the funny sounding just works well with BK's voice (as it did with Spragga's on Playa). Overall, this one is strictly for true BK fans, new fans or fans of hip-hop and r&amp;b need not apply.

Black Woman &amp; Child, Explain to the Almighty,Praise Ye Jah, Dem Ah Wonder, Holding Firm, Mek Dem Secure, Dem Ah Gaze, One Away, Give Dem Ah Ride, Words of Devine, Dem Ah Try Ah Thing Brutality For Love, Babylon Ah Listen, Good Ways, Azanldo Jah Blessing and Taking Over. That right there, alone, is enough for a fantastic album, but, when you spread those over two discs and sprinkle in some lesser known, underground gems, a terrificly written article in the liner notes and explanations of every track you have an beautiful sounding and excellently presented project. This album is a long-overdue greatest hits collection from one of the greatest lyricist in the history of music. Take every song I mentioned, add Like Mountain (see for evidence of perfect lyrics), Kings of the Earth, I Wonder of course, Do You Ever?, Blaze Fire Blaze and Clean up Your Heart, greatness just continues. Easily the best album released this year (much respect to the Prophet)Truly a fantastic greatest hits album, there are no bad songs, pick this one up immediately, mandatory listening for all Kalonji fans. To the unfamiliar, think prime Marley-level material here. Bigup Sizzla and Vprecords! AMAZING!

Big respect goes to Jamaica's own Mr. Usain along with the rest of our fine Olympic team for representing the country so nice and wonderfully at this year's games. Their incredible performances have brought quite a bit of attention to not only Jamaica's sporting and sports development, but, in my opinion, to Jamaica as a whole, the sports, the culture itself and maybe even the music. Bolt, Asafa Powell and their teammates also took a bit of Jamaican culture to the Olympics with them which (ESPECIALLY in Bolt's case) was evident obviously from the first moment they stepped off the plane in far more ways than just the accent. What had many people referring to him as being arrogant was the same thing many back at home were celebrating and cheering as Bolt left just a bit of bashment in Beijing and people were dancing in the street (your`s truly included). Fast forward just a few months later and although just a bit of the attentions have railed back, the athletes remain part of everyday conversation (and seemingly will for a VERY VERY long time), as do they throughout the entire Caribbean as athletes from all over the region represented quite well with Bolt actually recently being declared Man of The Year by a popular newspaper and is still virtually all over place. Their achievements have also meant quite a bit to the Jamaican music industry, more directly than just dancing in the stadium, definitely. Even before the games, they left with tunes pushing the great hopes of the situation, like Mavado's WICKED On The Go, which was voiced for Powell and featured the now somewhat ironic line of, "Jamaica have the fastest man inna life, him fasta than car and bike" (yes, we do, just not the one you're thinking of). Powell even has a full on compilation (released by Nike, his largest sponsor) entitled Asafa Powell: Train For Speed which features some of his (allegedly) favourite music to train to such as Wayne Wonder's No Letting Go, Sean Paul's Deport Them, Half Pint's classic Greetings and even Tempted To Touch from Bajan soca superstar Rupee (the aforementioned On The Go is an exclusive for the release). Rather unsurprisingly at the helm of compiling Asafa Powell: Train For Speed, was VP Records (because they own EVERYTHING, if you want to license ANYTHING with reggae, you have to call them). When the athletes came back home, they were greeted by even more music as the artists, from Elephant Man (DUH!) all the way to Sizzla Kalonji (twice) had come with some vibes in celebration of the crowning achievements, taking them to an even greater (albeit expected) stage of exposure.And, as if you needed something else (and you didn't); you, like I, were not surprised AT ALL when VP Records released the much anticipated COVER PICTURE (which is just as anticipated as the actual music on the disc, each and every year, be honest) of the latest installment of their second most popular annual signature series (after Reggae Gold) Strictly The Best with a caricature of a very Usain Bolt-ish figure on the cover in a packed stadium, looking like craziest and greatest place on earth. This year's edition comes with quite a bit of background facts to it that the casual fan may have missed out on during the year: First of all, the first thing that you may notice about this edition is that it is just one edition. Strictly The Best is usually a double album release with the odd numbered version being the dancehall piece and the even numbered one being more roots and culture and lover's rock material. Why is there only one release this year? Well that may have to do with the fact that VP Records also, early in 2008, bought their largest and most popular competitor, the UK based Greensleeves Records. With buying that label and committing themselves to keeping it open and running it (which they have done and are in fact releasing the big album Stronger from Fantan Mojah on the label this same week) as a predominately separate unit from VP, they also inherited its compilation HEAVY release schedule. Greensleeves had years where they released FAR more compilations than albums (I'm talking in the range of 3 or 4:1) from actual single artists. Although that had changed in the last couple of years, they definitely were still a compilation heavy label. Their own releases were the likes of their Ragga Ragga Ragga compilation which features big vibed (and general R and X rated) dancehall from some of the genre's biggest names; their was also The Biggest Reggae One-Drop Anthems album which features more of the roots talents in reggae and prior to just last year, checked in at a WHOPPING forty tracked double release and was easily one of the strongest roots compilations on the market if for nothing but MASS alone; and the One-Drop Anthems' dancehall counterpart, The Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems, which, again, up until 2007 came in the form of a double disc forty track project. Strictly The Best's second disc isn't the only `casualty' of the merger as the Ragga Dancehall Anthems release for 2008 didn't make it through either and I wouldn't at all be surprised if it didn't return at all at some point because seriously the risk of literally VP Records competing against Greensleeves (which means VP .vs. VP) is just too great. Strictly The Best #39, therefore becomes the first since StB #31 to be released on its own and like that edition, the trick here is to pour what is literally two album's worth of material into one seventeen piece (definitely doable). I myself tend to favour Strictly the Best just a bit more than the Reggae Gold release (which is easy this year, RG 2008 was just bad) because, like the older Greensleeves compilations it tends to focus on more underground tunes or just the tunes which aren't, at least not yet, spinning day and night locally and internationally. The dancehall portion, in particular, is definitely a different focus as dancehall on Reggae Gold is limited to only the biggest names (or VP's most recent signee). Strictly The Best is certainly no different in its approach, throwing an all around solid compilation, with a few nice twists and turns along the way.Strictly The Best, like any compilation is only as good as the tunes you choose for it and the way in which they are chosen. StB #39 sets itself up as the first half being predominately dancehall with the second half being lover's rock and roots. It features tunes which are, for the most part, quite popular but only in the Caribbean and the extended Caribbean communities throughout the world. As if there was any question after the cover what VP had in mind for this edition of StB (and there wasn't) getting things started on Strictly The Best #39 is Elephant Man's Nuh Linga. The tune is based on the popular dance made popular worldwide by Bolt after his three wins in Beijing and there's even a version of the tune made ESPECIALLY for Bolt himself. Nuh Linga REALLY, however, is a fairly pedestran dance type of tune from the reigning king of such tune over the Look Gal Riddim. Just like Bolt, Elephant Man can do better, but overall the tune is DECENT and indeed harmless, but given the circumstances, it `fits' on StB #39 probably better than any of the other sixteen tunes here. A pretty expected way to get things started. Another expected track here, but one which is a noticeable step up from Nuh Linga is Back It Up from dancehall superstar Sean Paul alongside Lefside (aka Mr./Dr. Evil). Anything which bears Paul's name almost instantly becomes a polarizing tune in the dancehall given his international status, but I don't even care what you say; the bouncing Back It Up is downright addictive and one of the better dancehall tunes on StB39 altogether. Completing the opening to the album is the very popular Playing (No) Games from singer Serani, part of the famed Daseca production crew, over TJ's Unfinished Business riddim. The riddim itself is derivative of the old Showtime riddim from Dave Kelly. While I accept Serani's genius in the studio behind the board, I'm still on the fence about him as a singer with his voice which fits SO well at times and just NOT AT ALL at others. Playing Games is a strong enough tune and a few months back was one of the biggest tunes on the scene. Decent start to the album for the most part.The album scores its single greatest shots, in my opinion, just before it shifts to the roots sides of things with two SHOTS of a similar nature. Both Mavado and Konshens score with what are essentially sufferer's anthems with their Overcome and Winner, respectively. Winner was quite controversial, but it went to establish young Konshens as it reached number one on local charts and is seriously a contender for song of the year with vibes to overcome AT ALL COSTS. It is topped by Overcome, StB39's finest outing overall. Overcome is SPECTACULAR. I've loved it since the very first time I heard it as Mavado, as only he can, outlines exactly what is needed to overcome in this day and age of harsh violence and reality (and he would certainly know) for Stephen McGregor at Big Ship. The tune is just beautiful and accentuates all which is good about the controversial singer. Things on the second side, the roots half are a bit more straight forward and even MORE predictable (if that's possible). The single best tune there is, of course, Etana's very popular I Am Not Afraid. The problem with that, however, is that if you've read this far into this review, there's a good chance that you've been spinning the tune for the better part of a year. VP, ever the promoter, also choose to include Love Created I (Marcus Teaching) from Tarrus Riley and his recent Challenges re-release album (also on VP, SHOCKINGLY). Although I'm being a bit sarcastic, make no mistake about it, Love Created I is a BIG tune, its mere presence here makes it one of the best tunes altogether on StB39. Perhaps the best new(er) score on StB39 is from one of the two elders on the album Tony Rebel, who hits nicely with his popular Another Bill Again for Penthouse. The tune speaks of the rising troubles for most Jamaican's (and actually people everywhere) to keep up with their bills. Definitely a nice addition here and I don't think you'll find it on any other official album around today. Beres Hammond (the other "elder") also comes through with Love You Like That, a bonus track from his most recent VP album, A Moment In Tim. The tune spins DIVINELY over Lenky's exquisite Venus riddim and is standard Beres fare, you'll love it, guaranteed, definitely one of the best tunes StB has to offer. Going back to the dancehall side for just a bit, I'll mention Beenie Man stepping in with one of the more recent in his ever growing catalogue of hits, the infectious Gimmie Likkle. Again, this tune, which is somewhat on a soca vibes to my ears, is standard Beenie Man, the man just has an ability to score with some of the `easiest' sounding tunes around, eschewing the far more complex nature of some of his peers (see Vybz Kartel, see Aidonia, see Busy) and you really can't complain too much none at all (I actually do rate Gimmie Likkle, even though I'm tired of it). I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't mention the recently retired Mr. Vegas' wonderful old school vibed Mus Come A Road, easily one of his best efforts in a while and one of StB39's best as well. Back to the slower side of things is the group L.U.S.T. (Lukie D, Thriller U, Singing Melody and Tony Curtis) who seemingly refuses to go away. They check in with the best tune I've EVER heard from the crew, Just As I Am a remake of a tune from the Australian rock music act, Air Supply. The tune is somewhat sappy, but far and away LUST sings the tune FAR better than I'm sure Air Supply ever even imagined it could be sung. Expect further VP ventures with the group as they have released solo albums from all four members of the group individually. Strictly The Best #39 comes to its end somewhat curiously with two tunes. First is Ce'cile's WELL spun sequel to her hit Waiting, Ride Or Die for Danger Zone's well solid Journey's Riddim (also available on it's own album). And the real closer here is, in case you haven't been paying attention the second half of the year, Busy Signal's Tic Toc. The tune is the lead single from his recent VP debut album, Loaded. It isn't exactly a BAD tune actually, but I don't think it was very good to begin with (the video, however, is amazing) and I've already tired of it. Both of the final tunes here almost look as if they were just thrown in as bonuses, ESPECIALLY, Tic Toc from Busy Signal. Of course, its more of the usual self promotion from VP and really its taken them this far, so apparently they know what they're doing definitely.Overall, this year's edition of Strictly The Best has, even more so than other times in recent years, become a piece more for the newer fans and casual fans of reggae music. It has a few pieces for the more established heads, such as Another Bill Again and the likes which you may not have on an official disc of any kind just yet (although I'm sure wherever he is, Tony Rebel is working on an album containing the big tune and you may just want to wait for that one). Strictly The Best #39 also serves as a look to the future as well. I fully expect albums from Beenie Man, Sean Paul (and probably even Mr. Evil for that matter who also has a deal with Sequence Records I believe) and Mavado in 2009 (Overcome may even prove to be that album's first single), which is definitely within VP's style of building its compilations and has always been. Strictly The Best #39 proves to be quite a harmless lateral step from recent years in quality, however. Its definitely not great and definitely not bad, but I think it will do quite well, building on what has already been an outstanding year for Jamaica's image.

This one is all about Lenky. The magnificent producer of not only the Masterpiece, but the riddim that ruled the dancehall in 2002, the Diwali. And while, in my humble opinion its not as good as the amazing Diwali, its still very good and minus the Diwali, its the best riddim i've heard in a long time. Just like its predecessor the vibe here is so powerful its amazing. The only 'problem' with the Masterpiece if you can call it a problem is that its a tougher riddim to ride than the Diwali, so therefore, on the album, there are less really good tunes, as the Diwali album was virtually empty of bad tunes. However, there are very low points on the Masterpiece (i.e. Price Tag by Buccaneer, Real Good by Hawkeye, Have Some Fun by Desperado and Wine Baby Wine by Danny English and Egg Nog)(Zumjay's Shake It aint all that either. That being said, the good tunes on this one are very very good and virtually cancel out the bad ones. Elephant's Give Her It Good is a great tune for the dance, just pure hype on that one, Sean Paul's Ever Blazing, same thing, very very good, sick that it was left off his album. Beenie Man keeps it going on his excellent 10 Out of 10 which is very tight and somewhat playful. In my opinion the second best tune here is Raging Storm by Bounty Killer, the flows on that one is ridiculous. . . Second only to Tanya Stephens, who rules the Masterpiece, much like she did the Diwali, on her Own Man, she loses you with her flows. I also like Spragga's Dat She Like and remarkably Vegas' Uh Huh, as he has been making nothing of note recently. Check Chrissy D's Rock Me, which my mother loves and unknown Aisha's Critical, very good.Much like the Diwali, one of the best tracks on the album is the final track which is just the riddim itself, or a mix that Lenky put on it. Speaking of mixes, Lenky does it like it should be done, changing the riddim on nearly every tune so no 2 sound really alike. Overall, I say get this one, especially if you really liked the Diwali, or if you're just a fan of modern ragga dancehall and you want to see wants going on, if you've lost touch.Bigup Lenky and 40/40

This album is for every hip-hop fan that wants to hear a little dancehall, or vice-versa. Check out the remix track 18 with Choclair on the Original Tune remix. The remix of Girls Dem Sugar is hot with Mya, so is Love Me Now with Wyclef. I'm also feeling Art and Life, Trus Me, and Analyze This. Fantastic cd.

One of the single most satisfying things about listening to a lot of music is that you are constantly exposed to a wide variety of different artists. While I certainly wouldn't call Bushman "NEW" to me, (I've known of him just about the time he started seriously recording) 2004 was the first year that I actually started really listening to the artist, and I've been deeply impressed from the start.Higher ground was one of his excellent albums on the Greensleeves label and it took me 3 years to actually get it, but it was worth the 'wait'. Higher Ground is amazing from start to finish. Bushman's style falls smack right in the middle of such singers as Luciano and Prince Malachi, where he differs from those artists, however, is his style of writing. Bushman writes 100% about the things that he sees, Luciano is so adept at writing songs that he can write a 7 minute boom tune about a thought he once had one day 20 years ago! And Malachi came up in that Xterminator camp (as did Luciano actually) where everyone there seemingly devotes every waking second to writing lyrics.The best tune here is probably Yaad Away Home, the opener, however, I have a hard time deciding between that one and Robbery Aggravation, Robbery Aggravation is massive! Also really really love Your Love, Fire Pon a Deadas, Make a Change, Blood Out and Love of the Heart, but like I said, this one is a real winner, one of the very few albums that I own (and I own literally thousands of reggae albums) which can be enjoyed from beginning to end while extending its 16 tracks over an hour+.Overall, Higher Ground is not as risk-taking as a lot of other roots reggae albums, its pretty straight forwards. Bushman is singing about topics which can generally effect everyone, dismiss Higher Ground a a project from just another Rasta Man singer and you'll never forgive yourself. Higher Ground is amazing!

Listening to modern reggae music these days, you can't help but be aware of and somewhat (whether by choice or by their overall activity) of a listener of the Morgan Heritage Family. Be it on an actual album, which they're pretty regular at, releasing a big album every 2 years or so, performing, and they tour constantly or producing, which they are very good at, the Morgans have truly saturated the reggae market and are arguably the best known performing band on the modern roots reggae scene.However, I'm not a big fan of theirs. They make a style of reggae which for some reason just does not click with me. I'm much more of a fan, in fact, of their production work, including producing for the unknown wicked singer Prince Theo and making the riddim which the legendary Jah Jah City by Capleton and many other good songs (including Love is the Solution by Jah Cure) were on.But it doesn't take only a fan to realize how fantastic of a live act the Morgans are, Rockaz is, in fact their second live recording, the first being Live in Europe in 2000. This concert took place in late 2005 in Amsterdam on one of their countless persuits through mashing up Europeon stages. It took me a few trips to the record store, but ultimately I decided to go ahead and pickup Live: Another Rockaz Moment (and VP makes it such a warm target, that cover is absolutely gorgeous!). Another factor in my buying it was that the shelves aren't exactly brimming with modern reggae LIVE albums. Its a very unattended to genre within the music which was very popular in the late 90's-early 00's, but has nearly vanished these days amongst current artists.The music also sounds a little different when done live, so I find myself enjoying a few of the songs which I know, but weren't very fond of from the Morgans' studio albums.My favourite track actually is the speech, In This Day & Time. The track is just a talk, just a reasoning which leads so nicely into the next track, So Much to Come. That's a great example of the music being different live, as opposed to being done in the somewhat restricting nature of the studio. Sometimes you can hear the greater intensity in the vocal performances. And I remember the song from the Full Circle album, where it basically didnt do anything for me.Some of the songs which I enjoyed previously from the group are also well done on Live. Especially check Tell Me How Come! over the enchanting Seasons riddim which sounds sooooooooo nice done by the Morgans live. Also loooooooooove the live treatment of Your Best Friend, again, with the very nice lead in. She's Still Loving Me also very nice done. . .just mark me down as really enjoying the final quarter of the album immensely!Earlier on check the Intro of course, getting everything going in a very very good mood. Its lead in helps makes the opening song, In Dem Ting Deh even better and the strong one drop on that song (and throughout) just shines! I also really like Live Up, A Man is Still a Man (a song I distinctly remember disliking!), Hail Rastafari and one of my favourite Hertiage cuts, Maskal Square, from the More Teachings album I believe.Overall, definitely reccomend Live: Another Rockaz Moment! I'm sitting her wishing that their next album would be a live album, these songs sound so much better done in the live treatment and you don't get the typical things you get in reggae with the wheel up or the changing of the riddims. The Morgans seem to make a point of singing the songs how the fans would know them, which is always a good idea! Another good idea is picking up this album.

Ward 21 is probably one of the downright strangest and yet most talented acts around, especially in the dancehall arena, and with that eccentric group, thats a terribly difficult title to come by. Their production work is always top notch, while their own music is at times.. .. .. out there and at times off. But as I said, they are also very very talented.This being their second album, I wasn't looking for too much of an improvement on anything, I was just looking for great vibes, and that they do deliver by the truckload. U KNOW HOW WE ROLL, is pretty similar to their debut album MENTALLY DISTURBED, the main difference being this albums tempo changing: Where Mentally Disturbed seemed to be out to hit you once and then immediately hit you again. U Know How We Roll, seems out to hit you once and let you recover and then hit you again. Songs like Something About Her will throw veteran fans of 21 for a loop as might Reggae Pledge, as both of them are on slower tempted riddims and are both almost basically on a rapper's scale and not a dj's.Don't worry if you are that vet fan, the hit Rhyme and its sequel Crime are both present on this album, 2 of the funniest songs, I have ever heard. A song called Rhyme that sets itself of to do just that, but never actually crosses that point. Another underground style hit is the ultra uptempo and near masterpiece Petrol, a song that gives you a chance to catch your breath only when its over. And Petrol's 'sequel' Hey Gal presents a very similar MO. Also check Forget About It, featuring reggae's overworked but highly talented young singing vet Daville; Style a kind of an anthemic chant fueled by seriously tight flows; the album's seconed best tune, Badda Than Dat featuring Bounty Killer, the Warlord might be wise to stay near to 21 productions as he never fails to deliver when dealing with them.The album's greatest masterpiece is Nah Climb featuring the bwoy soon to be king Vybz Kartel, while perhaps standing more of an example of Kartel's, its inclusion on this album makes it a sought after project in dancehall, Nah Climb is flat out dominant.Overall, 21 has of course paid its dues, its leader and dominant figure Suku has worked for and along with some of the biggest names in the business. With more projects like this, its only a matter of time before 21 takes its turn at serious crossover and with production like theirs, it shouldn' be too hard.

In the grand scheme of things &quot;Be I Strong&quot; didn't make alotta noise, but it was a very very good album. It isn't the most consistently good album Kalonji has done, it certainly has its share of average songs, &quot;The Vibes&quot; with Capleton is kind of a party sounding track which is unfortunate because anytime those 2 get together, nothing but a classic should be produced. But against the average tracks, it also has magnificent sounding music, like &quot;Men &amp; People&quot;, &quot;Stop the Youth&quot; and the album's best track &quot;POWERFUL&quot;. Also check out &quot;No Chance&quot;. Overall its pretty average Kalonji, but average Sizzla still makes a better than average and pretty good record anyday.

Its been 6 incredily long, healthy and beautiful years of living since Lady Saw dropped her last album, the underrated (and well censored) 99 Ways. While she's been 'away' artists who were somewhere in highschool in '98 have come to the forefront and not just dropped albums, but developed careers and names for themselves. Also, females in the business have emerged, re-emerged and stepped their game up to lay a challenge to Lady Saw's throne.While she's spent more time on tour than in the studio the last 6 years, time has fortunately done nothing to diminish her skills, lyrically, personally or image-wise.Enter the aptly titled Strip Tease. While I'd hate to diminish songs such as Dedicated to Mama and My Dreamz, good tunes are they both, Lady Saw, like 6 years ago, like 6 years from now is at her best when she's being what she is. The slackest dancehall artist since the late great General Echo (what might a Saw/Echo combination have sounded like?).The best song here is the bluntly titled Pretty Pussy which brings the old Saw up to the date on a new age riddim absolutely tearing it up. Also love Loser which is a combination with younger (but established) artist Ce'cile; Another (odd) combination Good Love with Sizzla; the hilarious Lock It Up and best Pum Pum. Another tune I really like is Thug Loving which is, of course, slack, but it slows it down to a point and Saw absolutely breaks it and locks off the flow, I can imagine the producer in the studio saying "You just broke my riddim", she locks it on the tune.Overall, what I will say about this album is that I wasn't too impressed at the beginning, it takes a minute to grow on you, which can be expected after 6 years of hearing absolutely everyone else. But Strip Tease is what it is, it's an album by Lady Saw, that alone warrants a purchase, but Strip Tease is more than that. Its the latest album from a Legend whose still making her music at her highest level and still giving her fans what they want.Big album.

There was a time, around two years ago, when UK reggae giant label Greensleeves had a much different focus. The label had apparently lost site that it was, in fact, a real label which served customers; DJ's and music listeners alike, and strictly was apparently serving the DJ market. The label, which had made its name (in terms of modern dancehall at least) by virtue of releasing albums for artists like Elephant Man (the first three of his career), Red Rat (the only 2 official albums of his career), Mr. Vegas (the first two of his career) and other popular acts such as the ultra talented General Degree, Buccaneer, and little known pieces for dancehall royalty such as Mad Cobra, dancehall king Beenie Man and rival Bounty Killa. Instead of continue that style of releasing albums, Greensleeves had apparently turned the shift of their entire company to releasing albums to support their rhythm album series, which they released to the tune of 2-3 per month. The shelves of artist's releases for the label had all but dried up, consisting regularly of only the yearly schedule release by Sizzla Kalonji. This all happened despite the fact that some of the strongest talent that the label had EVER signed were in the rosters, and their two signed acts at the time consisted of Ward 21 who also participated in the Rhythm Album Series (including releasing three of the first five installments of the series including the first, The Bellyas riddim) and Vybz Kartel, both of whom grew increasingly disinterested with the label to the point where Ward 21 ultimately left the Greensleeves camp. There was also the matter of Macka Diamond, Kid Kurrupt and Predator. The three acts (all of whom are STILL signed to this day!) had to go through years and years of waiting to get their projects released, this, despite much talk (especially on the part of Predator who would tell virtually anyone who would listen that his album was coming out soon) and local pre-promotion for albums that would never be released, of the three, only Macka Diamond's debut, Money-O has seen the light of day, with the other two projects seemingly shelved, indefinitely.Halfway through 2005 something began to shift over at the label when the very odd release, Anthony B's Black Star was released (to typically very very bad pre-promotion) and was followed by the announcement of two significant releases for the album: First was the Biggest Reggae One Drop Anthems double cd and 40 tracks strong album and then there was even more significant (and a title which was forecasting what was apparently to come) the announcement of the signing of Fantan Mojah to release the new and emerging hit maker's debut album, Hail the King. The album itself was a huge deal in reggae circles as a year had been building for the demand for Mojah's debut and with similarly hyped artists such as I-Wayne and Assassin having their debuts announced for VP Records, Greensleeves had scored a major coup by snatching up Hail the King. But they didn't stop their (and of course a Sizzla album, Soul Deep, was mixed in there as well), the next year, 2006 would see an expansion on the roots direction of the label, especially increasing after the sale of the label to Zest Music Group. Another release early in 2006, the Triumphant riddim album would also continue a strange progression of the label, but it wasn't actually until later in 2006 when Greensleeves' focus apparently begin to be strictly Zest's actions and not just old plans and the once mighty Rhythm Series album stalled at #86, the jam packed Ghetto Whiskey riddim album. However, the last year of the series was probably amongst the most solid and some very very fun releases were catching the international light of the day, largely due to Greensleeves' (and VP's for that matter) push , and the `good ole days' of riddim albums in the late 90's were seemingly recaptured (literally!).The trend of re-birthing and re-vitalizing riddims of yesteryear (no matter if they were made years ago, or literally the year before) had been running the dancehall for a good solid year before 2006 rolled around, and continued well into the year (and is arguably, beginning to die down just now). To the dismay of critics (who claimed the trend to be a significant sign that the seemingly endless vibes of dancehall producers were going through a stage of famine) Jamaica's music scene had turned into. . . Jamaica's music scene, circa 1991. But the people were eating it up, me myself, I was very interested in seeing what certain artists who were primary school bound the first time a particular riddim rolled around, could now do with a certain piece. Besides that, producers and artists alike began extensively collecting material like such, the result of which became evident on albums like Sizzla's Waterhouse Redemption, Buju's Too Bad (and even more recently on Luciano's God is Greater Than Man) both of which proved very successful not only abroad, but definitely in Jamaica as well. Riddims like the Throwback Giggy, the Twice Again and especially the World Jam (the Jamaican dancehall version of Jr Gong`s update of Ini Kamoze`s riddim, used on Welcome to Jamrock), were taking over and getting more and more popular. And not only that, but new riddims which had old-school vibes to them like the MASSIVE Nookie and the Sleepy Dog riddim, both of which could have seemingly mash up dancehalls in 2007 or in 1987.Then there was the Mud Up. Re-birthed as the Return of the Mudd-Up, the only seven year old riddim was give a tweaking and received yet another chance by its original creator (which is rare as most of the other older riddims were brought forth by new producers). I had a love/hate relationship with the original version of the riddim which at times came off as downright odd with its odd playschool/ice cream truck opening and its almost funny dancehall one-drop which brought an entirely new concept to minimalist production (even in reggae!). It was so odd, that many of the biggest hits from the riddim are not even known for being on the riddim. Capleton's Hands Off, Vegas' She's a Ho, Vegas and Elephant Man's combination Bun It and especially Sean Paul's MASSIVE Check It Deeply had all undergone metamorphoses by the time they reached the international audiences on album form (and Vegas co-owns In the Streetz, the label Murray produces for) In such a short time even, the ever-evolving Jamaican dancehalls have changed, and the new Mudd-Up definitely shows that change as it is entirely more complicated than its older brother. And the artist selection almost reflects that as well, with older artists (many of whom voiced the riddim the first time around as well) are combined with the next generation of artists in a very nice mix and job of artist selection by Murray and Vegas. Particularly nice is the inclusion of the ladies (although I would have LOVED to see Lady Saw voice the riddim as well, this is just exactly her type of vibe) Macka Diamond (who I suppose was still Lady Mackerel when the original riddim was released) and of course the legendary (to everyone with common sense to see how wicked she is) Lady G, and even Ce'cile gets her chance on the Mudd Up as well.Of course the guys represent as well and more than hold their own on the riddim, both the older artists as well as the newer ones. Beenie Man actually scored what amounted to the biggest hit for the Mudd-Up on the X-rated opener Man Nah Leaving Yuh, and his track is definitely one of the better tracks on the Return of the Mudd-Up, but he doesn't quite get the title for top track here. Nor does his oddly absent sparring partner Bounty Killer, whose absence on the riddim was actually quite surprising considering exactly who else was here (and what happened to Spragga!). Beenie's effort starts the Return of the Mudd-Up, the album, on a very good foot and the following three tracks maintain that hype, pushing the finest such stretch on the album. Turbulence's NC-17 rated Di Ting (yes dat ting) is about as slack as the Bobo will ever get and actually one of his better pure dancehall tracks in his career (I guess its something about the riddim, makes the topic of discussion relatively easy to figure out). Skipping to Buju's well solid (and sexual) Good Good Pressure Dem which is probably my choice for second best tune on the riddim overall. This riddim was made for the exactly the type of track Good Good is and Buju sounds in his best dancehall form and is a track which, if I remember correctly, actually missed his last release, Too Bad, where it would have fit perfectly and been amongst the album's finest tunes on an already stacked piece! However, they all pale in comparison (and not by a lot) by what Vybz Kartel does to the Mudd Up. . . Pon Dis Ya ____ is MASSIVE! Kartel pushes forward one of the craziest flows of his well highlighted career and pushes about 35 words where even some of the fastest chatters could only push 20 and of course the song is probably the slackest the riddim has to offer, but still! Very very impressive showing by one of the true dancehall masters of this time.The album overall takes a slight downturn after the opening four tracks with a few highlight tracks sticking out. Check Mad Cobra's Gal Say Wow, Cobra is definitely another artist (maybe even more so than Buju as he is more laid back, perfect for the riddim) his track is definitely amongst that next quality level of tracks and may actually challenge the first four. As does the following She She by Ce'cile who uses her well modern style to flow nicely over the Mudd Up and she does about as fine a job as actually riding the riddim itself as anyone. I also have to mention the `light snack' Tuck Up by the underrated and oft-forgotten (even by me) Ninja Kid. Checking in at under two and a half minutes, the song barley makes a dent, but we wish it was longer as it definitely worth a spin or two. The young Aidonia doesn't fail horribly on the riddim either which is surprising as, probably, he has the one style on the album which is seemingly hardest to adapt to an old school vibe and he does have that `bigger than needed' sounding vibe of him at time on his Spray Spray Dem, but it comes off as a very Ninja Man or Cobra sounding tune. Sizzla's Ain't Scared scores well later on the album, but locking down the last quarter is without a doubt Lady G's Run Him. Still one of the most talented DJ's the island has ever seen, Lady G scores one her best tracks in recent memory definitely. And I love the fact that the album ends with a clean version of the Return of the Mudd-Up.Overall, when you're going back looking at the riddim albums from both VP and Greensleeves, I'd recommend maybe giving the Return of Mudd-Up a listen. It's definitely for the more keen dancehall fan, newer fans may not necessarily appreciate that old school vibe and the old school vibes on top of it. Strictly as a riddim album, I have to say there aren't many surprises here, Murray doesn't ever noticeably change the riddim from its basic style in the 20 tracks which is a subtraction definitely, but even the re-licked version of one of the most `barely there' styled riddims I've ever heard (maybe second to only the original Mud Up) so it doesn't come off as overbearing and I didn't necessarily get tired of the riddim. This album (and a few others like it) will probably be best for that dancehall fan that doesn't listen a lot or maybe lost the music for awhile, because there are times seriously listening to it, that you might downright forget what year it is that you're listening to. Only dancehall heads need apply.

It's still pretty good. Last year's Ragga Ragga Ragga 15, was amazing and this one certainly had massive shoes to fill.It does okay, coming with 2 tracks from each the Prophet and Kalonji, which, in itself, could make a mediocre album a very good one. Another thing worthy of a mention is that Shabba Ranks has a track on the album, long time no hear from Shabba and on Give Dem Di Shabba, he gives a slight reminder as to why he used to be the top dj. Also, check T.O.K.'s excellent Falla We, VP made a mistake by missing this one on their album, Mad Cobra of course on Press Trigger is tight. Bounty Killer sounding angry, as always, on the Beenie Man aimed Look Good. Beenie himself on Erase Your Mind which is probably his best track in awhile. All that being said one of the best tracks on the album is surprisingly (because he hasn't really been making good tunes as of late) is Lexxus'Good Hole, which, despite the title, is a very very good song. The bad: 3 Elephant Man tracks (he's on almost every dancehall comps. these days all are pretty wack, Gold Voice making an entire track from his hook on Goofy's underrated track "Slam You and Leave" on Bashie, is hard to listen to; and where's Merciless? Or at least on Beenie's counteractions to Bounty, if you're not a fan, you really have no idea why Bounty is so angry. Overall, its pretty good like I said, but buy these in order: Get 15 before 16.

Releasing just two albums in the first half of any given year its still considered ultra busy for most artists (particularly when the artist just released one of the most commercially successful albums of their career the previous October) these days. Imagine having a responsibility to promote both albums, to tour for both, to do interviews for both and even before that; having to actually MAKE both albums. Things are different in reggae music however, and especially on the roots side. With artists such as Luciano, Turbulence, Anthony B, Jah Mason and now seemingly Lutan Fyah and Natural Black adding themselves to that mix releasing multiple albums per year with absolutely no problem and still managing to tour several times per year and record year round as well, roots reggae music is a genre of music so hungry for vibes that it seemingly demands more from its greatest champions than any other musical genre. And arguably the greatest champion of them all is not only not immune to such demands, he is in fact the undisputed leader of them. Should I take a count on how many albums he has done in the 12 years since he made his first (the now ultra hard to find, and wonderfully solid Burning Up, both covers!) , the number would hover right around (but probably over) a stacked forty eight studio albums, not to count the various greatest hits, region specifics, anthologies and mixtapes, putting his average right at around 4 or so a year (and there was a year or so in there where he had no releases as well). Sizzla's fans ostensibly have no problem pushing the money for his albums, tours and various other forms of media to which the August Town native comes to them during a given year. Should you follow through with each release and every time he comes near your town, you could probably expect to have a `Sizzla budget' of around $100US each year just to keep current! To himself he has always maintained that what happens on the release side is of virtually no concern to him and his ridiculous recording schedule has only remained so high, in an attempt to keep up with the overwhelming demands from his fans of needing something new at ALL times. Of course, Sizzla at times suffers from over-exposure and over-saturation of the market as the term `new Sizzla album' begins to become blurrier and blurrier given the fact that he often releases albums just one or two months away from each other (widely believed to be his two greatest creations to date, Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah were released in 1997, just 36 days apart); `new Sizzla album' can mean any two or three albums at any time of the year.So what is the reason such cost uncaring fans can rather zombie-like head to retailers, money in hand to pick up the latest Sizzla release(s myself firmly included!). In our generation, in all of music, one could rather easily make the case that no musical artist, no writer, no poet or any other wordsmith has created such wonderful pieces as Sizzla Kalonji. When he is at his best (which is a case of apparently however he feels at any given point, or the riddim on which he voices) reggae music itself, blessed with a rich history of well sharpened pens and even sharper wits has seen few as sharp as Sizzla's. The legendary Ninjaman once boasted (and probably still does) that one could wake him out of his deep slumber and he could DJ on any stage for any group of people from just the top of his head, the same could be said for Sizzla when it comes to roots music which often appears to come too easy to him (check the Black History album, and the studio half of the Words of Truth project). The result of this has drawn heavy criticism as the lyrically gifted Bobo has delved and continues to, into the dancehall side of things which includes quite often recording slack and violent tracks, and even to the point of making albums in that vibe (check the ridiculously hard to find Blaze Fire Blaze album and I do mean RIDICULOUSLY, Wha Dat? Records apparently was created for no other purpose than to release that album, as they have promptly proceeded to vanish from the face of the earth since). This `experimental' vibe culminated in 2003 with the release of the downright ODD Rise to the Occasion (which has since been called both rubbish and brilliant by critics). His shot at the mainstream was also quite unusual, in the form of 2006's The Overstanding as well as albums such as Soul Deep, Ain't Gonna See Us Fall, Brighter Day and Up in Fire, which all seemed somewhat stuck between the dancehall and roots, reflecting the perception of the artist himself. However, mixed in between such pieces, the most stalwart (and stubborn) of fans were treated to such undeniable gems as the MASSIVE Da Real Ting and its LIVE version, Bobo Ashanti, Royal Son of Ethiopia and just last year's bar of gold, Waterhouse Redemption. Greensleeves Records has always been a staunch supporter (and beneficiary) of Sizzla's talents as they have virtually changed the game of releasing albums for artists, releasing a Sizzla album every year since 1999 (with the brilliant Royal Son of Ethiopia beginning it all)! Perhaps only Elephant Man who had a three year continuous release streak with the label before reaching a major has had such a success with the label (were he not to have made it to a mainstream, he would seemingly be still releasing for Greensleeves who all but cleared their schedule for each Ele release) which was notorious for its horrible artist relations; having had several signed artists (neither Sizzla, nor Elephant Man have had official contracts with the label for their releases) such as Predator and Kid Kurrupt go without a release at all for years and other ones still, such as Vybz Kartel, Macka Diamond and Fantan Mojah grow impatient with the label, and in the case of former signed artists, Ward 21, just leave altogether, with Greensleeves seemingly more intent on releasing their riddim album series. However, the label has seemingly had a change for the better, and in the last year, was purchased by Zest Music.The two questions which always precede a Sizzla release are: Who Produced it? And is it dancehall or slackness? This question is perhaps amplified on a Greensleeves release given the motley group of previous releases, however, just like last year, if you seek the good natured and roots imperial sound on which Sizzla made his name, expect to be supremely satisfied. While last year's Waterhouse Redemption was a wonderful throwback roots piece produced by the legendary Waterhouse resident, King Jammy. This year's nicely titled, I-Space, comes not so shockingly produced by album producer of the moment, Byron Murray and this one is for all those who aren't too high or don't know exactly what to think about Sizzla in the dancehall style. YOU NEED TO CHECK I-SPACE! Murray has been releasing albums for the likes of just about everyone in the roots side of reggae (and managing to stay current with the dancehall riddims as well). Just in the last year or so, Murray has produced albums full of materials for the likes of Norris man (Home & Away), Jah Mason (Wheat & Tears) Turbulence (Stronger Than Before), Lutan Fyah (You Bring Blessings) and the legendary Messenjah Luciano (Child of a King with apparently Natural Black still to come in August with his , it was seemingly only a matter of time for him to strike with an album for Sizzla Kalonji (now it wouldn't be too bad should he have a hand in producing the next Capleton album, that is of course, unless Calibud doesn't produce the entire thing on his own) and I-Space doesn't disappoint at all. It doesn't reach the stratosphere as such pieces as the great Black Woman & Child (my personal favourite), Praise Ye Jah or Royal Son of Ethiopia, but it fits firmly that next group of pieces such as Da Real Ting (of course some make the argument that Da Real Thing does fit into that first group, which is an argument that could be made successfully and Freedom Cry and Bobo Ashanti. I-Space is modern roots mastery at nearly the highest of levels.Pushing his tenth Greensleeves album to date (Black Woman & Child was originally a Greensleeves release just 3 months shy of ten years ago) Sizzla offers I-Space, an album full of gems, some of which ascending to the heights of being able to probably fit on the BW&C; album (although the brilliance that was that incorporated a sickly high level of vibes, lyrics as well as MELODIES) and not bring that album down at all. Particularly shining here are the three greatest pieces which could only help any Sizzla album ever released and ever to be released. Check the previously released brilliant Chant Dem Down. Chant Dem Down was (a rather nice local hit) a track that appeared on Greensleeves One-Drop Anthem album last year and was one of the better tracks on that forty track monster. Flowing nicely over Murray's excellent Street-Swing riddim, the track Sizzla engages in a rather odd style of flow which almost distracts from the message of the song. Take away the unusual voicing style (which seems lost somewhere between his standard chanting style and that high falsetto he pulls out when needed and just listen to the lyrics and you have a tune in Chant Dem Down which is good enough to be one of the very best roots releases by ANYONE over the past few years, and just through my cursory initial glance over the track listing, I had it marked as possibly the biggest track here, and should you want to call it that after listening to the entire piece, I won't argue against that at all. Then you check the wonderfully vibrant Long Live the King of Kings over Murray`s older, yet still powerful re-lick of the I Shall Be Released riddim. Pushing what is easily the greatest message on the entire album, Sizzla chants a song to His Imperial Majesty so powerful that it alone, would be worth the price of admissions for I-Space. As the first verse of the tune opens, he so simply states it, `All praise to HIS Majesty, give thanks for HIS love and HIS honesty'. Long Live the King of Kings is a track which could fit into any era of roots music certainly and let the critics tell it; this is a Sizzla that is long gone, let me tell it; and this is a Sizzla who could appear at any time he so wants it to. The biggest tune here finds the arguably greatest champion of this era showing honor to the greatest champion of all-time. I-Space opens with the peak setting Really & Truly which again finds Sizzla chanting over a riddim originated by Nesta himself. Earlier this year saw the release of the nice track Blaze the Fire by Sizzla which flowed over the `Old Pirates' riddim (which would have fit excellently here as well), the riddim was a re-lick by Gaddafi of Marley's `Redemption Song riddim'. Really & Truly finds Kalonji going over probably the riddim to my favourite Marley song ever, Natural Mystic. The message of the song is another powerful praising track, and Sizzla (combined with some excellent background singers) create excellent MELODIES on the Fatta & Bulby York re-lick. My favourite artist over the backing riddim for one of my favourite songs of all time, yeah I'm partial, but really, how could it go wrong! Really & Truly has proven to be a large local hit and is a MASSIVE track.The balance of I-Space is still top notch material and finds him going on a STRICTLY ROOTICAL vibes. Check Jah Protect My Life very powerful track over one of Murray's stronger riddims (which is saying a lot, his stable of roots tracks are amongst the most powerful in all of current modern roots) the Devil's Pickney riddim. I'm loving now the two tracks near the middle of the album which find Murray refashioning some older vibes for Kalonji. Check both Show Some Love and the lovely Talk About, both two of the stronger tracks on the album which change up the vibes just a little bit, but don't change them to the point where you're left wondering exactly what happened, but just enough to give I-Space a nice balance (think Princess Black from Black Woman & Child style changeup). Sizzla has his run of pretty much all the nice In the Streetz riddims as well, check the very nice Stop the Violence over the Mo Bay riddim, very very minimalist production (which is generally Murray's style); Make Me Yours flows very nice over the Girls Like Dirt riddim originally a Coxsone Dodd piece I believe (Murray did an excellent new school impersonation of Studio One however, if its not), and Make Me Yours is probably the most powerful lover's track on the album. Have to mention the very powerful Be Careful with the nice warning to all to live righteously and (that nice nyah drum opening!) just an all around powerful vibes. LOVE the drumming on the foundation track Nothing But Love! The album ends with the nice acoustic set Put the People Interest First which ends rather poignantly with Sizzla rather matter of factly saying, `Who Jah Bless, no man curse': An excellent way to end one the midway choices for album of the year (which at this point, in my opinion is a three way `battle' between I-Space, Ras Shiloh's Coming Home and Tony Rebel's MASSIVE I-Rebel).Overall, although he has gone six months with just two albums (more like one and a half because the mess that was Penitentiary's Children of Jah) apparently nothing is wrong with Kalonji s I-Space finds him in just about as good as condition as one could hope. I'm super saturated on this one in bias because Sizzla is my favourite artist, but even if you don't rate him so highly, I-Space is to be recommended to you as a very very strong roots piece. The year is just half over and most likely he'll make yet another appearance (Cousin's Records seems a likely choice as they have to date released albums by old Xterminator heads such as Turbulence and Luciano with Chezidek releasing his very strong Firm Up Yourself in just 3 weeks, so unless they plan to do a Prince Malachi piece (which isn't a bad idea) or give Congo Jesse his long overdue sophomore set (TOO overdue at this point) or go turn up every stone inna Kingston to find (Roaring) Lion or Shadowman, then they're running out of Xterminator alum, having already released Lutan Fyah, Xterminator's most recent occupant) but it'll be a mighty big feat overcoming I-Space, one of his best in a while.

The Bad Kalic is a hot track, as it stands alone, even without an artist to be very good. It is a very heavy sounding dancehall beat, which is undoubtedly why it serves deeper voiced artists better. That being said a few of the better cuts on the riddim are by Sean Paul, of course, and Ce'cile, on Could a Why and Know How, respectively. And Ce'cile's combo track with the Doctor on No Loving, sounding very much like an r&b; track.That being said, the best of the best on the riddim are songs by Capleton, Buju, Spragga and Merciless. The best being by Capleton on Wi Nuh Tek Dis, even before Still Blazin' came down the Prophet has been improving his lyrics to a boiling point. Even Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer's prodigy, does decent on Gun Clown. The aboslute best song on the Bad Kalic is by Kalonji as is usually the case with riddim's he voices on, Girls and Roses is easily one of the best songs that I've heard in this young year. Overall, there are some weak tracks here (i.e. Mr. Gunman by Vegas, Wi Nuh Si Dem by Bling Dawg & Tanto Metro & Devonte's Trench Coat) but they are cancelled out by some of the excellent lyrics on the track. Buy this one if you are a fan of current dancehall, and you won't be disappointed at all. Very good riddim.

It may not, ultimately, be albums the likes of I Believe by which Sheldon Campbell, aka Turbulence, is known. It is exactly on such an album, however, where you can see the sickly level of ability the young artist posseses.Turbulence, just like his mentor Sizzla Kalonji, is going mad this year with album releases. I Believe, from the Netherlands based M-Records, marks the artist's 4th album in the year's first half and 11th overall. However, with nearly all of his efforts being at the level they are, any hardcore roots reggae fan will have no problem with it, and I Believe is probably the best of '05. . . so far.The entire vibe of the album kind of reminds me of Turbulence's second album, and his most publicized to date, Rising. Both are sort of spectacularly solid and big sounding productions, which is a rare combination (the likes of which is normally reserved for a Capleton record) of atributes. Everytime you hear the artist, he grows more and more comfortable in his style. He now flows quickly put fluently between djing, chanting and straight out singing. This proves most effective during We Need Love, the albvum's best tune, which Turbulence has shown a love to performing live over the years all over the world in a slightly sped up form.Also have to check old school sounding What the Hell; Got to be Smart; Sweet and Pretty with Turbulence's group, Higher Trod, member Prince Javed doing a good job; the big ganja tune High Grade; the very very good Nah Stop Run and the album's second best tune, Taking Over.Overall, listening to I Believe, I'm fully ready to declare the 25 year old a complete master of the game. His skills have evolved to the point where, like his mentor, he could seemingly be awaken from deep sleep to write and record brilliant material. I Believe is in no way the artist's best work (that designation is still reserved for the massive Join Us), however like most of his material, it is devoid of bad music and is quite effective. Someone will eventually have to get hold of Turbulence's breakout tune Notorius and put it on an album. However, while we wait for that album (which could still come this year seemingly) I Believe is nuff worthy of any Turbulence fan's or fan's of roots attention.

Everton Blender fits rather perfectly into the 'not-so-old-but-very-old-sounding'Reggae singers, along with others such as Beres Hammond and Freddie Mac, as men in their 40's who sing ultra-ultra mellow dancehall music that has managed to remain relevant on some level to younger fans who generally swear by younger, digital and lightening-tongued DJ's and singjays.On King Man, Everton is completely entrenched in his greatest work to date. Simply put, this album is awesome! Absolutely pristine from beginning to end and everywhere in between. The best tune is the Binghi version of The System which sounds like it could have been done great without the band at all, just the congo drum. Also absolutely love the title track, Throw Down Your Arms, Hail to the King and False Tongue and it's Binghi version.Overall, absolutely check this one out, if you're a fan of really good Rastafarian music, if you're a fan of dancehall music, or really just good music in general. King Man applies to everyone, and it might actually be the best album that I've heard this year.AMAZING!

An interesting thing is happening on reggae albums these last few years. You can probably count on one hand exactly how many albums have been released by the top level dancehall artists this year, while at the same time, you might need about 3 or 4 to count how many have been released by roots reggae artists at the top, just in 2005 alone (because of Sizzla's, Anthony B's and Luciano's propensities for releasing about 4-5 a year). And dancehall artists don't tour as well as roots artists either.However, speaking specifically in album terms, by far one of the most successful instruments in all of reggae is the dancehall riddim album. It is released in some form or fashion by every big reggae label in the world. It generally includes the top level dancehall performer and sometimes the up and coming artists as well. And you will see them released by the DOZENS, every year and they sale, if they didnt, Greensleeves would have went out of business by now.Greensleeves often spends months at a time dedicating its time to strictly its Rhythm Series. For example, 2004 ended with the Slow Bounce riddim, #66 in the series, this year alone has seen all the way up to the Ice Cube riddim, #76 in the series, and as it just so happens, #77, the Justice, was just released this week as well. Greensleeves DOES NOT PLAY when it comes to the version album!The Ice Cube in particular, produced by previously unknown Mr (Ernie) Wilks Productions is very very different. It is a ridiculously fast paced, souped up riddim that takes a good while to get used to (apparently longer than the 20 tracks here). It is so different and. . . just odd that I can imagine how difficult it might have been getting artists to record on it (which may explain why riddim album CRAZIES Elephant Man, Sizzla, Beenie Man and Bounty Killa all passed.From those who did brave the unforgiving Ice Cube, General Degree scores the best with Hardcore Reggae, taking the cube just like the vet he is. Oddly enough, Red Rat (well not so oddly, he's kinda odd himself isnt he) also handles the cube fairly well on Curfew as does Kiprich on Kurfew. Also doing a good job is Red Square (minus head men Spragga and Assassin) on Bad From Wi Born, and Spragga himself on Backative Strong.And that's about it. The rest of the tunes are filled with half of Leftside & Esco's alter ego Dr. Evil on the odd No STD, and even more strange, Kartel on a tune called new with lyrics that are. . . OLD!Overall, do not buy this one on unheard advice at all. You MUST hear this riddim and like it before you too brave the Ice Cube. Mr Wilks may prove to be a great producer ultimately, but a suggestion to him would be to change the riddim more amongst the artist's tune, that's the next step in such an album, even the hardest dancehall nut (myself included) cannot possibly stand the Ice Cube for 20 tracks with no, or very little, variations.

In the annals of long delayed reggae and dancehall albums perhaps never has there been a more popular or noteworthy album of such kind than Rasta Got Soul by roots legend Buju Banton. Rasta Got Soul (which ultimately may NEVER be released) was set to be Buju's follow-up to his very own legendary piece, the epic `til Shiloh album. It was set to even (at least attempt to) bridge the much talked about between dancehall reaching the mainstream and the roots sound which hadn't as of yet done so. Ultimately Buju, perhaps driven by his growing amounts of critics far and wide, shelved the Rasta Got Soul project in favor of Too Bad, and while that album was easily one of the most complete dancehall albums heard in years, still a question remained about how much Soul, Buju's Rasta did have. While perhaps none have reached the levels of anticipation of Rasta Got Soul, there have been similar constantly (and in some cases never appearing) reggae albums as well; Lady Saw's Striptease actually at one point had an official release date, before being shelved over and over again before ultimately seeing the light of day in the fall of 2004, around two years later than expected. There is currently Elephant Man's Ova Di Wall, which no longer exists and in the face of the artist's signing with U.S. major Bad Boy, has been shelved indefinitely and made way for another project due to be released in 2008 in the west, Let's Get Physical (which you can currently obtain via Japanese import). With the ever-progressing nature of reggae music which is unarguably on one of its strongest upswings ever, one can very well expect similar situations to occur and probably on an even much more frequent basis as the next group of reggae superstars roll in. Still, that does not make it right, and what happen in the case of Dancehall Princess Ce'cile was so oddly perplexing and just wrong. The Galchester native's career goes back nearly a decade and has included nearly a decade of constant hit making. She too has maintained quite a consistently high profile in Jamaica which goes to help her case as some of her more internationally famous male peers often fail to do so, Ce'cile has been on point for YEARS. Her history also, strangely enough, includes several associations with record labels which most certainly could have produced her debut album; First, she was most associated with the Kings of Kings label by reggae veteran Iley Dread with whom she sung (very nice) backing vocals and co-wrote songs with Norrisman. From the KoK, she also briefly associated with Cordell `Scatta' Burrell, still to this day one of Jamaica's most outstanding producers, for the short-lived CeCo Productions, which, again oddly enough, produced one of the best dancehall riddims in recent years, the Double Jeopardy of 2001. ALSO, she was the artist of one of the most controversial songs by a female in recent years (actually two of them), Changez, on which she comically chastised her male counterparts as to why they were not fit for her position.And there was more! In 2002-03, Ce'cile announced that she had in fact signed with American based label Delicious Vinyl and was releasing her debut album, Bad Gyal in 2003. At roughly the same time she was scoring not only in Jamaica, but around the world with the VERY controversial Do It To Me (also for Scatta and KoK), on which she demanded `reciprocation' of sorts for the ladies amidst the macho male sexual dominance in dancehall. She was also riding high with Can You Do the Wuk, a tune on which she playfully sparred with dancehall superstar Sean Paul. The album would have been perfect at the time, and Delicious Vinyl even showed their willingness to support the genre in signing and releasing Pull Up, an album by dancehall ace Mr. Vegas, in the summer of 2004 (which would have STILL been a nice time to release Bad Gyal, and they have just recently released Vegas' follow-up to Pull Up, Hot it Up as well). Bad Gyal was, however, for some strange reason shelved by the label, and would never appear over the life of Ce'cile's contract and overall association with DV, and she took the project with her when she left their roster in the summer of 2005 for greener pastures. Greener pastures came in the form of yet another arrangement for the singer which has finally produced her long awaited debut, Bad Gyal, Danger Zone. The album took the now more and more preferred route of several artists (particularly, but not restricted to those on their debut albums) of releasing Bad Gyal exclusively in Japan either through JVC or Avex (which is the label here). Danger Zone itself is of EXTREME interest now in that currently, although Ce'cile has been the most active name and is probably the one which the label is most associated with, Danger Zone, headed by Della Drummond, is also the home for veteran Jigsy King and up and coming artists Mikey Pelpa (whose following in Jamaica is quite large) and Cutty Corn (and his sidekick the WICKED Ras Fraser Jr.). OH YEAH! Danger Zone is also the official management group for none other than Jah Cure, which alone makes them a name that MUST be mentioned in reggae circles. Ce'cile's own involvement with the promising label doesn't come as a surprise, due to her involvement with several aforementioned others, however, Danger Zone apparently has proven to be the genuine article as they deliver to the world Bad Gyal, the debut album of Ce'cile. The album comes very late, however, it may perhaps serve to introduce all of those unfortunate few who have yet to be introduced to the female singjay (and yes I'm calling her a singjay, the title seems to have been almost exclusively reserved for the males) who is definitely one of the most interesting artists to have emerged in the dancehall over the past decade or so.The first thing you will notice about Ce'cile (and also her album) is that she is VERY easy on the eyes (I myself have ALWAYS had a nice affection for the artist so I'm probably pretty partial in this one) and just all around fine. But you cannot listen to her looks, and her style is one which shows her to be as comfortable on the DJ side as she is as a singer (and she has a very nice singing voice) and the whole of it is put on display on Bad Gyal. Bad Gyal opens quite interestingly with Worth It. Worth It is a track which I was all set to say how much I didn't like, but ultimately has grown on me. The track, produced by drummer-turned-hot-producer Kirkledove doesn't particularly say anything of great importance or interest (it is a rather typical money wanting track) but I like the song! It has a very sexy vibe and ultimately when she does get around to the actual verses on the tune, they are quite impressively strung together (have I mentioned that I might be a bit partial?). The venom which I was about to give to Worth It, I will instead give to Goody. Goody isn't particularly a HORRIBLE track (it isn't that good either) but it is marred due to the fact that it flows over the ATROCITY which is the Wipeout riddim. The riddim has always been one of my least favourite since the very first time that I heard it, and, built her very own home, Danger Zone, it has annoyed me every step of the way. HOWEVER, I must mention that Goody is in fact one of Ce'cile's bigger tunes of the past couple of years and it received quite a push, even leading to a very nice video (which I watch with the sound muted) and it carried a vibe which obviously reached and struck a chord with quite a few people, so YOU may very well enjoy it, for me, although the subject matter DEFINITELY fits in with my guilty pleasures, it is easily my least favourite tune on the entire album. Rounding out the opening few tracks is the very slack but very very clever and sexually mature Oooh. Oooh flows over one of the most underrated riddims in recent memory in my opinion, Danger Zone's very own Forbidden Dance riddim which is very addictive. The highlight of the tune is without a doubt the final verse on which Ce'cile taps the louder DJ which she uses occasionally and I think its her best route as a DJ, very very impressive.Very interesting is the fact that on Bad Gyal, the vibe is almost exclusively hardcore dancehall and upbeat on a faster vibe, BUT the two times when she slows it down (and actually does the work herself), Ce'cile mines absolute GOLD. Check the closer, the very nice Duppy Song. Ce'cile is given a producer's credit on the tune and it seems like she absolutely constructed the tune just for herself. It has a very unique sound, with somewhat of an old school reggae vibes, but also almost a big band sound to it as well, also her vocals on the track venture all over the place, and in the midst she proves that she can really sing (although she does spend the majority of the tune with an embellished calling style). Absolutely love the tune, had never heard it before and definitely a very nice inclusion as a lover's track of sorts as part of the softer side of the big Bad Gyal. The overall shining and best tune on Bad Gyal however, is definitely the other track on which Ce'cile is credited as producer. Danger Zone is currently riding high with a few pieces, and without a doubt the best and heaviest is the sweet sweet Jamdown riddim. The riddim features very solid offerings from some of reggae's hierarchy including Buju Banton, Capleton, Morgan Heritage, Junior Kelly and Ras Shiloh and two divine pieces from Lutan Fyah (with Mightier Than Them) and of course the label's own Jah Cure with the AMAZING Sticky. Unsurprisingly, Ce'cile scores with the tune which ultimately went on to be the title track for the riddim, Jamdown. Jamdown the tune is yet another lovely track showing off the island and all its beautiful and positive aspects and the absolute crowning jewel for Bad Gyal. Ce'cile also had another tune for the riddim, the very nice Waiting, and although its obvious why they wouldn't want to include two tracks on the same riddim, I wouldn't have necessarily minded seeing Waiting here as well as it too was very solid. Ce'cile's Jamdown is also exclusive to this album, yet another reason to pick it up, love Jamdown!Things are back to normal on the balance of Bad Gyal as it features crazy tunes of the hardcore dancehall variety. Without a doubt (on paper at least) the two standouts are of course Hot Like That and Gimme Some. Hot Like That is one of my favorite tunes Ce'cile has done and it flows brilliantly over Steely & Clevie/Lefside and Esco's big Throwback riddim. In this case, it is featured in a form with US rapper Trina also having a verse. I would have preferred the tune in its original form, but it is still a solid and sexy addition. Gimme Some is another combination, this time with frequent Ce'cile spar Beenie Man. Gimme Some is THE hardcore dancehall track of choice on Bad Gyal definitely. The two have always made good tune together (dating back to, I believe, a tune name Loving on the Bad Kalic for Stonelove) and Gimme Some is definitely no exception. Three other older Ce'ciel hits are also included if you weren't paying attention the first time around: First up is Give (Do) It To Me, the aforementioned controversial track from her KoK days over Scatta's Coolie Dance riddim; Again she taps Scatta for the Rave riddim (which is VERY addictive) for the former hit Johnny; and Talk Talk flows over Reggae Republic's Inevitable riddim (produced by who? Yep! Scatta!). Talk Talk is an almost comical admonishment to Ce'cile's female friends to be careful who they brag to about how good their man is in the bedroom. And lastly, I have to mention a more current piece, No Soft Inna Bed (pretty obvious what that one is about), her current cut of one of DZ's most recent pieces, the Payback riddim.Overall, the only big drawback for the album (and again, I am partial) is exactly what you might expect for an album literally coming about five years delayed; in that much of the material is just old. I might also add that much of the subject matter is particularly of sexual nature and the Bad Gyal really and truly earns her moniker. But in between all of that (and even IN some of that) is some very solid material and very promising material. Bad Gyal had very little chance to live up to so much time spent in anticipation of it, but Ce'cile, as she has always done, makes it work for herself. So, I recommend it, but especially to those who haven't been following her career very closely as somewhat of an introduction of Ce'cile Charlton to you. Bad Gyal is a very nice introduction and I'm thinking the next one will be even larger, hopefully we won't have to wait very long for it.

Red Alert is certainly not Sizzla Kalonji's best work, but I have to admit, its one that I imagine he probably had the most fun making. It's fairly standard material from a flat out genius. Having gotten the European version of this one (which means that I've had about 2 months to sit with it) I'm continually impressed with the way that the artist can seemingly not even try, and still churn out top material, it amounts to what I'd call a serious amount of determination of Sizzla to get out his message. This album absolutely (like all of his work) bleeds Black Strength!The best song here is the ultra familiar Beautiful World, really really strong tune that is, also love the opener Your Love Is and Life. Dancehall heads are not neglected as the album certainly contains its share. Later in the album appears a tune called Long Way (#13) on which Sizzla spends nearly a minute discussing the important virtues and strengths of Rastafari before launching into a downright beautiful heap of lyrics on which leave the listener with a strong message if he/she truly ingests the material. Also love the fun-sounding Blessing.Overall, as I said, I certainly wouldn't call Red Alert the best that this amazing talent could do, but it encompasses nearly everything that has made Sizzla Kalonji loved by millions around the world over the past 10 years and hated by a few, but if you are truly able to pick up the message here, you'll come to the same conclusion those millions have: Not a stronger messenger exists in music today.

While the year 2007 continues to line itself up there are several high-powered albums set to be released this year. Besides the expected new releases from Bounty Killer, his (ever shrinking) Alliance, Lady Saw, Elephant Man and the allowance of Sizzla's 3-4 albums, also perhaps in the offering are albums from, among others, Capleton, Assassin, I-Wayne, Chuck Fenda and the inevitable Aidonia and Mavado debuts. However, amongst roots reggae-heads, perhaps no album (besides maybe Jah Cure's first post-release album) carries more hopes and anticipation than those of Richie Spice's fourth full length studio album and debut on reggae major VPRecords, In the Streets to Africa. With 2006 proving to be one of the most pivotal years of Spice's career, as he ultimately established himself into the next echelon of roots singers and an almost guaranteed hitmaker in JA, it was only natural that he would be the next big artist of the few who gets a deal in reggae music, and the result is the somewhat complicated In the Streets to Africa.Richie Spice is the younger brother of singers Pliers (of Chaka Demus & Pliers fame), underrated singer Spanner Banner (with whom he tours) and lesser known do Snatcher Dogg and he has without a doubt come out of that shadow (if he were ever in it) to become one of the most in demand local artists in all of reggae music. Internationally, he has gained a mass attention due to the release of MASSIVE tunes such as 911, Blood Again, Marijuana, Righteous Youths, Ghetto Girl and his biggest hit to date, the epochal Earth a Run Red. His popularity reached such an unusual level after building it (it almost seemed like Spice left the island and went on tour and returned 20x bigger than when he left!) that upon signing Spice to a multi-album deal, VPRecords almost immediately re-released his only 2 year old third album, the poorly distributed, yet LOADED Spice in Your Life from his base label, Fifth Element (VP also released FE's I Swear riddim a couple of years earlier).For his own part, Spice has become one of the more visible artists in Jamaica appearing on all the big shows and nearly every big roots riddim to emerge over the past 3-4 years. He, along with former stablemates Chuck Fenda and Anthony Cruz put Fifth Element on the map as one of the big emerging roots camps and further solidified reggae music's return to roots. His own style is something that I call right in the middle. Taking two ridiculous extremes in terms of voice; Jah Cure's beautiful shattering unearthly stone vocals on one end and Luciano's deep and mellow vibes on the other, Richie Spice's soulful wail is part Cure and part Luci. His style of writing is close to one of his peers, singer Bushman in that they both tend to write about on earth, tangible situations and problems. Spice, probably from growing up with his family has that start quality however, besides making beautiful beautiful music and staying far away from Jamaican tabloids, Spice, however, manages to stay firmly in the limelight.The much anticipated In the Streets to Africa is somewhat of an odd album. It harkens back to the era of mid-late 90's dancehall albums which were as much compilations as they were actual albums. Fans of Spice might actually come away disappointed for awhile while catching the vibes from In the Streets to Africa. I, myself was included in that group and it took about a week of straight listening to truly appreciate the album, I had heard MUCH of the material before, and at this level, that isn't necessarily the best approach to take.Despite that fact, that, ultimately doesn't take too much away from the album at all, the songs are still easy to appreciate (I'm just thankful VP didn't role out Folly Living for this one as soooooooo many compilations from the past 3 years have done.). What I'm begrudgingly calling the album's best track is official first single, Brown Skin over Vendetta's brilliant Heavenly riddim. Brown Skin is about as POWERFUL of a love song as you might find in all of modern roots reggae. The very fact that it managed to distinguish itself on the Heavenly which backs many strong tracks is force enough in itself, however, standing on its own merits alone, Spice absolutely hit a winner the second he stepped out of Vendetta's booth.Continuing along that same vibes, In the Streets to Africa is an album full of wonderful lover's material. Check the wonderful previous single, Groovin My Girl. The song kind of gets overlooked besides the three other big lover's tracks here, but definitely holds its own amongst them (even though it was actually on Spice`s second album, Universal from 2000). Check the almost over-abundance that is Baby Face which features Spice's two older singing brothers Spanner Banner and Pliers. The song, an odd combination between brothers is MAGICAL. it's a lovely idea and a powerful vibes and definitely a potential singing as VP continues to promote the album, it would be wonderful to perhaps see the song performed live one day as the brothers Bonner shine on the tune. The additional lover's tune on the album is the previous hit single Uptown Girl over the State of Emergency riddim. Not much can be said about Uptown Girl, it's a very very strong song actually uplifting the Black woman, very mandatory selection from In the Streets to Africa.Other standouts include Motherland Calling from Downsound's Maroon riddim, which was definitely one of my favorites from the strong strong nyah backed riddim. Of course Massive B's Youth Dem Cold we've all been vibing to for a while now, still a very big track and one of Spice's career best (it actually sounds like something that would have been better placed on the Spice in Your Life album; and check Take it Easy from the (Telephone Ting) My Baby riddim, again, we've all grown quite fond of the tune by now.However, when you look at the track listing for In the Streets to Africa, for heavy reggae fans, one track will undoubtedly stick out on paper alone. The downright brilliant Digital Ways featuring the late great Father Culture himself, Joseph Hill. We lost Mr Hill last year but its because of wonderful material like Digital Ways, a call to not forget the ways of old, that he shall never be forgotten, and the well versed Spice definitely holds his own with the legend. Digital Ways definitely the biggest surprise from the album and a check to make sure that you're still paying attention.Also, I'd be doing you a disservice not to mention the two openers, both Get Up and Open the Doors are wonderfully strong tracks and an excellent way to get this album kicked off to a fine start. Babylon a Gwaan is also a very very strong track and is probably my third favorite here overall, after Brown Skin and Digital Ways. Also present in the earliest release is a very useful DVD featuring behind the scenes material of Spice, videos and performance bits. The CD/DVD combination is becoming increasingly common in music and reggae has jumped on that train as well with VP doing fine jobs on this one, as well as Tanya Stephens' Rebelution and Soca and Reggae Gold 2006 albums.Overall, if you haven't been listening to Richie Spice much over the past couple of years (then you probably won't have read this far into this review) then you will LIKELY be even more fond of the album than I am. It is that strong of an album and actually through several listening sessions with it, it got stronger and stronger as I started to look at it as a whole and not just a collection of singles. Blame does have to go somewhere for failure to deliver more fresh material, while that rarely is a problem in reggae-circles to date, as we enter a stage where more and more money is spent on the vibes, you almost have to deliver that fresh batch to fulfill the title `new Richie Spice album', where before, we were just happy that our favorite artist had a new album out. Fans you'll still check this one out of course and new fans you'll enjoy it more, either way, support good reggae music, pick up In the Streets to Africa by Richie Spice and tell them Bramoi sent you!

Perhaps because his career subsequently slowed down a great deal after a musical split (and ultimate reuniting) with his home at Penthouse Records and his seemingly vasnishing from the scene for about 4 years, Jahmali's seminal El Shaddai is even more forgotten than some of the reggae classic album from the last decade. And although it has been treated so poorly by history, anyone who has ever heard the album knows how well powerful it actually is.When 'Mali first came on the scene he came with a lot of fanfare and enthusiasm. His style (although not directly derivative of) was somewhat similar to then recently deceased legend Garnett Silk. And the hype that surrounded him was not very dissimilar at all to that which now surrounds such young singers as I-Wayne and Gyptian, big things were thought for Jahmali. While he may not have had the legendary career (at least to date) which was foreshadowed, if he stopped recording TODAY, he would have left the world with a brilliant piece which is El Shaddai, which has vibes for centuries!The best tune here is without a doubt the well powerful title track. The track El Shaddai probably shows off Mali's voice to its finest on the entire album also his penchant for writing solid lyrics. While not as prolific as many of his peers, he still can hold his own lyrically. My second favorite tune here is probably the ultra-melodic Dry Bones, very very solid tune.The second half of the album (with the exception of Conscious Lover) is a complete winner! But without a doubt, the most powerful (even more than the title track) song here is Zion Awaits. The song kind of has a backing of an Afrikan chant, with a nice keyboard (Lenky) laid over the top of it, and its the most beautiful song on the album, sounds like something Jah Cure might sing.Also check Hungry People and the second hit from the album Politics. Hungry People has that solid solid reggae one-drop vibe that will just have you swaying without even realizing that you are swaying to that riddim.Overall, this is a pure winner. Looking back you see it is co-produced by Donovan Germain and Lenky who went on to have a great production career himself (from the Diwali). Out of all the niceness that has come out of Penthouse records, with Buju Banton particularly, El Shaddai is one of its finest, its up there with Til Shiloh. Its that good! Now, with VP Records proclivity in ressurecting old albums and releasing them, maybe next year or in the next few years they can bring this hard to find piece back. As a fan of modern roots reggae, consider El Shaddai by Jahmali, MANDATORY!

(4.5 stars)Chukki Starr will get overlooked in his career approximately 9.5 times out of 10. He is a dancehall/roots reggae artist from the UK, where his popularity is it's greatest height. The UK artists don't usually get a big forward in JA and that is probably why this artist hasn't received his just due as far as respect, because listening to Ghetto Youth's Livity, his debut album, it is clear from nearly the jump off, that this is a talent that needs to be heard, Starr's flows are ridiculous!It's always interesting to hear an artist who can dj pure consciousness, without even bordering on the slackness. Chukki Starr is such a talent. While most usually compared to the leaders of the type of music that he makes such as (usually) Sizzla, Capleton and Anthony B (the only of the 3 who sounds like), I'd liken Starr's style more to the newer generation of artists who 'stray' further and further from slackness such as Lutan Fyah, Fantan Mojah and Jah Mason. While I'd definitely not put it past the talent to actually cleverly chat slackness, it is something he never approaches during GYL.While listening to the album, it almost exits a spot where it stopped being a simple solid project and became something special. I don't remember exactly what point that was, but it changed from being the typical head bobbing outing to the constant rewinding of "what did he just say?!!!". The best tune here is without a doubt the title track which tunes in at an all-you-can-eat-buffet style 6:30+. The song is absolutely fierce and takes the full advantage of casually laid back riddim. Also have to check the opener The Almighty One which I had pegged as the album's king full-time before I continued with the listen. One Day and Mama Song, also Want to be Free and In Too Deep (but especially One Day) all good tunes.The interesting thing about this album is that, although it is 14 tracks deep, there are 2 interludes, a remix of The Almighty One and the final 3 tracks are dubs (unsurprisingly when considering that Mad Professor produced the album, of the 3, the first, 'Positive Dub' is the finest effort). That means that really there are only 8 true studio cuts on the album, and its to the artist's credit that. . .I Want More material here!Overall, of course check out Ghetto Youth's Livity. You almost have to hear the gem that is the title track, a really really fine cut that went a long way in establishing the artist (as did the entire album itself). As he is still very active (approaching 8 years since this album was released) Starr is still quite underappreciated but is still making strides in JA. Should you ever pick up GYL, he'll be making strides at your house as well, big album.

While I have absolutely no problem with a producer as talented as Lenky releasing as many riddims that he feels like releasing, and as many albums as record companies are willing to push for him, you would think that the artists themselves would be willing to put forth their best possible effort when faced with the possibilty of recording on the hitmakers latest. Not is the case on the Dreamweaver as pure vets Bounty Killer, Elephant Man and Angel Doolas all fail to hit the mark on their efforts, Hot Like Fire, Blessed and Addicted respectively. Also failing here is Wayne Marshall on the generic Get It On Tonight, the notoriously average Bling Dawg on Propaganda, T.O.K. on the gimmicky F-I-R-E, younger Alliance crew member Jagwa on the worthless Man A Badman, and eternally struggling singer Chico on the slightly less than average Thick &amp; Thin.All that being said, there is some good material here. On an album like this, of course the riddim is the star attraction, and thus the producer is the main performer, and perform Lenky does. This riddim goes through so many changes on top of its foundation, that by time you get to the odd sounding instrumental (which Lenky always, beautifully, includes on his albums) you have nearly lost the base and it sounds completely new. The good performances here are by unkown Nicky B, on the hilarious The Way We Roll, Go Deh, Go Deh by hotshot veteran General Degree, surprisingly In God We Trust by Lenky's in house dj Zumjay, which I'm comfortable in saying is the best tune I've ever heard from him to date, which hopefully shows that the artist is developing. Also check the doctor on Greatest Species, Vybz Kartel on the weed anthem Visa, and the album's best tune Girls Alone by up and coming Assassin, high vibes on that one as the young artist absolutely locks up his flow.Overall, the riddim itself is not quite on par with its predecessors The Diwali, the Masterpiece, and the Time Travel, but it is good, and at times features Lenky's signature handclaps, and the album makes it worthwhile enough to a true dancehall fan to have a listen. Newer fans, this one isn't for you.P.S. Check the war tune by Hawkeye Tek It Off, Put It On

There's some real garbage on this album. Sweetness by Buju Banton and Cam'Ron, on which I'd bet my left arm to a bucket of spit that Buju to this day has yet to hear his songmate's opening verse, Girls Callin' with Ghostface and Elephant Man and the OVERLOADED Reggae Remix of 112's Na Na Na Na isn't anything to write home about either.That being said there is some really good material here as well. The first single Anything Goes along with the video is an impressive tune with a video giving a fairly accurate representation of life in Jamaica, the well done Together with Black Ice and DYCR is also very good. Murda sounds pretty much like an average base for a TOK track but it goes above and beyond what they normally do thanks to their unique pairing with Nokio and Scarface; Damian Marley flat out destroys the riddim on Lyrical .44 with brother Stephen and the men Red and Method. Also love the strange combo Dave Kelly style with Shwanna(?) and Baby Cham and Sisqo on the hooks. All that being said my favorite 2 tracks on the album are Mardi Gras with Tanto Metro & Devonte and Joe Budden(?) and of course the current #1 tune in Jamaica Dude with Beenie Man and Ms Thing remixed with again the impressive Shawnna.This album probably served me differently than most people, dancehall comprises a huge percentage of what I listen to, thus I wasn't really familiar with some of the hip-hop artists on the album (i.e. Juelz Santana, Jim Jones, Cam'Ron, Ghostface Shawnna and others) but i was fairly impressed by some of them (Shawnna especially).Overall, it was much better than what I expected. I expected a few MC's to put on accents and play DJ (and there is definitely some of that going on here, but not too much). For hip-hop fans I would definitely encourage checking this one out as it serves to show (in part) where dancehall music inside of Jamaica is today and not just what you've been exposed to before, and you would be wise to check the future releases of such artists as Vybz Kartel, Baby Cham and TOK. For dancehall fans, I can't imagine that you wouldn't be the least bit curious about what's going on here, and its not bad at all, check it out one and all.

There are many many good things about being a reggae fan these days. With the exposure level of our music rivalling that which it attained during Marley's heyday all over the world, reggae has become almost an inescapable as any form of music, even outside of here in Jamaica. But perhaps one of the 'coolest' things about being a reggae fan is that, if you listen to really really high quality reggae from some of the very top artist, you'll never find yourself wondering "when is he/she going to have a new album come out?". It will never happen, mainly based on the torrid recording schedules most of our artists keep and the equally hectic schedule a great deal of our producers keep as well. It is not all that uncommon here for an artist to release 4-6 studio albums a year.And I, (as you can see if you go through my reviews) should be the last person to complain about such a thing, as I virtually live, breath and eat reggae music. However, the problem of overexposure occurs when one of the best in the business has an album which goes so far under the radar that it basically becoems unnoticed.Such is the case as this downright mysterious Hail the Comforter album, which I came across while shopping for his new Child of a King album. Not surprisingly, this album is released by JetStar who does such a fine job of underpromotion that its amazing they are still in business in the west at all.However, taking no fault at all in that is Luciano, who mores than delivers his typically A+ level material throughout Hail the Comforter. This album might actually be amongst the top half of albums for the amazingly prolific artist. While not being terribly melodic or vibrant, its darker and more old school and traditional vibes carry on a very very fine album.The best tune is Glory to Jah. The song is not unlike probably dozens of previous Luciano records, and just like them, it has such a powerfully crafted vibe (particularly the female backing singers during the chorus) that it really carries strong and becomes the major highlight on the album. The second best tune is without a doubt the title track which is oddly probably the best (slow)dancing song on the album, cut over the ridiculously nice one drop 'Handcart Bwoy' riddim. Luci probably makes the best go over the riddim besides Perfect who adorned the riddim with his name.Also check Herb Minister, Luciano is notorious for cranking out some of the finest herbalist tunes in all of JA. 'Minister' is almost an herb JOURNEY that he goes through, all the while demanding one of his favorite things; Check the only combination Too Greedy, with Anthony B. which is an apparent remix of the closing track Crafty, which is the same track minus Mr Blair, another fine combination in their nice but too short history together (remember Zinc Fence Jungle! Loved that song!).Another song which I love is Lonely Sheep over the same riddim which Dennis Brown cut his legendary Money In My Pocket tune over; and by the same token Loves Me Strong which goes over Brown's Sitting and Watching riddim (Luciano has a direct cover of that song which gives even the Prince's version a run for its money). And give a listen to the beautiful beautiful Wandering Woman and Stop the War.Overall, I could probably give a rather healthy recommendation to each and every tune on Hail the Comforter. And I will! Chances are, even if you pay attention as well as I do, that you didnt even know it was released (and chance are even greater that you didnt know the followup to this one has been released already, its called Shallow Water)due to the numbskullness (is that a word?) of JetStar. But dont fault the artist, or yourself for that. While not being amongst his most harmonic or melodic (probably want to check the Jah Words for that distinction) Hail the Comforter is without a doubt one of the most well-rounded and solid of Luciano's brilliant career.

There are several factors which can go into the longevity (or lack thereof) of a particular riddim coming out to road these days. Particularly on the dancehall side where the real hits come and go much more frequently (as do those making said hits), it can be very very difficult for a particular producer to make his/her riddim truly standout from the pack as anyone who can afford a board and studio time these days are turning to production. Gone are the days where such work was left to a very tight knitted group of ultra experienced veterans subjected only to the occasional `promotion' of a well experienced engineer and studio head to enter the production game; nowadays, everyone from current and former engineers, artists, soundmen, VJ's and even dancers are not only entering the production game, but bringing with them a clout to where the biggest stars in the industry are willing to voice for them. There does still exist that upper class of producers who, seemingly, in order to retain much of their strength have turned to more exclusive measures (I.e. signing a particular artist (which always occurred, but formerly on an entirely much more frequent scale) and producing less riddims for the masses). The current dancehall elite of producers include names such as Vendetta, Scatta, the Genius, Lenky, production trio Daseca and of course the Bros. Kelly, Dave and Anthony who both have attained a status now of legends and only really commit to a few projects per year (Lenky has also taken that route is recent years), and just a few others (i.e. perhaps a case could be made for Snowcone or Ward 21, and I DO NOT include legends such as King Jammy in the discussion). For a young producer these days to attract a modicum of attention, it is near impossible as the dancehall planets almost have to align just perfectly in order to open the gates to bring forth a new talents first, where as before, it was simply a matter of one having to pay his/her (although the concept of a female producer, save for just a very few names historically, is quite new, particularly in full fledged dancehall music) (Biggup DJ Sunshine) dues and be skilled. Now, where the game is entirely more patient when it comes to an artist in search of their first big (and mandatory) hit, producers are almost expected to deliver a big hit on their first production, failure to do so can make for a fairly quick return to one's FORMER career and complete desertion of a once promising career as a producer.Of the few ways a producer can ensure themselves to be a name in the future front of dancehall and scoring that big hit, probably the most difficult is aligning oneself with a talented artist, or even a smaller group of artists, and focusing on just that one or those few. This method is difficult just because of the nature of the game where not the most talented ALWAYS become the biggest stars (see Madd Anju and Roundhead), but in the few cases where it has worked, it has worked perfectly. No one can doubt that both the careers of Vybz Kartel and production ace Donovan 'Vendetta' Bennett would be greatly diminished had the two not made acquaintances and began a working relationship. Also, even though he had previously made his name, legendary producer Dave Kelly has taken that route entering the second phase of his career as much of his time at the top flight has been spent developing the now top flight and TRULY wicked DJ, Sherlock native Baby Cham as an artist. Another (and seemingly very popular) method for producers to hit the big time has been through simply getting lucky! Even `luck' however requires a definite skill and in dancehall TRUE skill is definitely rewarded. Take for instance the case of Stephen `Lenky' Marsden, who having well joined the ranks of talented musicians and engineers long ago through his apprenticeship for another legend, Penthouse's Donovan Germaine (an apprenticeship which included having been the primary musician and lead engineer on such fine pieces as Jah Mali's legendary El Shaddai album) joined the ranks of top notch producer on the wings of the terribly odd, gimmicky and yet sickly complex and highly addictive Diwali riddim. Such is also the case with another Stephen; `Supahype' Davis. Who, pretty definitively, scored with the biggest riddim of 2006, the Smash. `Co-built' with Craig Serani Marsh (meaning Marsh did most of the work), the head of Daseca, the Smash became the riddim of choice all over the dancehall listening world and the former soundman, former VJ and part-time (awful) DJ had scored his necessary immediate hit as a producer and is seemingly on his way to being one of the most unlikely of the elite dancehall producers (although he, perhaps even more than any others in my mind runs the risk of being a one hit wonder considering that he tapped one of his closest peers to pay his entry fee). The riddim was every where and if you were listening and paying attention it is almost certain that even to this very day, you are, at the very least, a little tired of hearing the Smash! So what was so interesting and new and fresh about the Smash? Besides the songs, which I'll get to in a minute, the Smash had a vibe which almost perfectly fit its name. Pushing a tempo which at times borders on Soca vibe (and it would have been very nice had they thrown in a soca head for the riddim by the time it reached album, just to see what might have been). Built atop a well mighty drum arrangement, one the best I've heard in quite awhile, the Smash is a riddim to be enjoyed in spurts, I CANNOT imagine what the person would even look like who could have a good time with this riddim for any particular significant length of time (well actually I could, see Asylum at closing time!). Despite its extreme power, the Smash is a riddim which requires PATIENCE to enjoy.Then there are the songs. Part of the reason why you, who may not exactly be a dancehall fan at all, have probably heard this riddim is based on the supreme popularity of one its songs, which, again, comes from one of the most unlikeliest of sources. If you found yourself anywhere near a radio in 2006, it's a fairly forgone conclusion that you've undoubtedly hear the `phrase' Dutty Wine. While said phrase was the title at the helm of several songs, the one you know is without a doubt the version which introduced the now rather infamous dance of the same name. One could make the case that based on popularity alone, Tony Matterhorn is now amongst the most in demand DJ's on the scene right now. The former (and still current) soundman came from that background as easily one of the most notorious, popular and successful soundmen in the world and made the transition over to actual Djing just two years ago, and the wait for his first big hit was very brief to say the least (especially when you consider that vocal talents in all of reggae can wait upwards of five years for their first truly big hit, see Turbulence. . . See Delly Ranx, Bling Daw, Kid Kurrupt, Gabriel and Danny English for that matter). Matterhorn's sickly addictive version of the Dutty Wine helped introduced an equally addictive and notorious dance, which to this day, you can't step foot in a dancehall and not see being done on some level. The popularity of both the dance and the song has spread huge throughout the reggae listening world, and right along with has been the Smash riddim (which is quite often referred to as the Dutty Wine riddim) which would probably take the title as most internationally popular dancehall riddim of 2006 as well.Thus it was no surprise when the riddim caught the attention of reggae giant VP and became an addition to their wonderful Riddim Driven series. The Smash Riddim as an album is decent enough, although quite difficult to maintain its pace over an entire 17 track album, it does a fair enough job although falling well short of being one of the better dancehall pieces in this series (that type of status belongs to riddims like the Liquid, the Juice and more recently, the Dreaming riddims).Although Matterhorn definitely takes the prize as the most popular piece here, the absolute best track comes from one of the `professional' DJ's. The Smash riddim easily hits its peak on the good and properly wicked Lu Lu Lu from Busy Signal. It was crazy difficult tongue twisting soon to be classics on which Busy Signal originally made his name. Although since his emergence there have been several names to challenge Busy for the title of best young DJ (namely Aidonia, Munga and Bramma) there can be no denying that Busy, at his best, is definitely amongst the most talented artists the dancehall has seen in recent years. Lu Lu Lu, although definitely something different, is amongst Busy's early nice sized hits and the best the Smash has to offer. Checking in immediately following Busy is dancehall's first boy band TOK, who have been up and down in terms of quality in my opinion in recent years and their Haters definitely marks one of their bigger `ups' as of late as their kind of `streaky style blends well with the otherwise unforgiving nature of the Smash. TOK probably does more with the riddim (which doesn't make a noticeable change at any point during its 17 tracks) than anyone else and makes their Haters one of the best tracks on the Smash altogether. One of the two other significant acts is unsurprisingly Vybz Kartel (sitting here thinking of the last big time dancehall riddim which was sans Kartel. . . Off the top of my head I'm back in Diwali days) with his XXX rated Ben Ovah which probably challenges Lu Lu Lu as the most complicated tongue twister on the Smash and well overtakes it in the category of MOST SLACK. Ben Ovah is pretty much standard Kartel, he also goes a little odd, like Busy, at certain areas but he well stamps that traditional Kartel seal on the Smash. The other big name here is Elephant Man who doesn't turn in a necessarily BAD effort with his See Dem, but the tune is well away from his best (another a tongue twister) although, like most of Ele's offerings, still highly entertaining. Just listening to the track on its own and predicting who might be one of the better choices for the riddim, one of the first names to emerge in your head would definitely be Ele, and he gives the Smash his usual treatment with a bag of lyrics just as unforgiving as the riddim itself (and OUTRAGE is still angry!).The balance of the riddim is made up of younger talents, most notably Mavado and Alaine who, at the time of this voicing, were still in the process of developing themselves to that next level. Both being mainstays at Daseca, their presence on the Smash is quite expected and they lead some very impressive young talent on the riddim which is ultimately quite thin at the top (no Beenie, no `Sassin, no Sean Paul, all of whom would have more than done justice to the Smash). Alaine shines brightest on her outstanding and very easy on the ears Baby U. Mavado, unsurprisingly, also favors the slack side on his XXXXXXX rated Pushing Hood, and shockingly doesn't at one time take the violent route on which he has so often made his name. Recently separated Left Side & Esco tune in for their neighbor Davis with their surprisingly solid Humble & Cool, very nice track. Upstart Annex mainstay Ice Cold goes social for the only time on the riddim with the very very nice Change and yet another producer Flava Unit rounds out the vocalists on the album with the very nice You Ah Di Wife before the very useful version closes the album.(Incidentally, DO NOT check neither Turbulence's awful Dun Di Place!)Overall, this one is strictly a do's piece. I can't exactly recommend this one for that stone cold well hardened dancehall fan either, vibing this one as is, is just not something I would try (although that level of fan probably had this one a year ago, myself being a prime example). Actually, despite the nature of the riddim, on the whole, singers come off as entirely more productive on the riddim with several of the singers scoring bigger pieces across the board. However, should you happen to find yourself as a DJ, even a year later, if you don't have the Smash in your box, you're doing your audience a great disservice, this one was made for you.

Every year we get 3-5 releases from reggae wonder Sizzla Kalonji, and there are generally 3 pertinent questions surrounding each of his releases. The first is which label, as he records for any and everyone who can afford to pay him and put out his music; The second is what kind of music is it? Is it the roots style that he made his name off of, or the hard dancehall style which he has favored over the last few years and is still very good at. The third being, Who produced it.Waterhouse Redemption provides as good of answers to those questions as any of Sizzla's releases over the last 2-3 years. Greensleeves is the label and they have had tons of problems getting artist's albums out (but are getting much better now) over the years, but never Sizzla's his uis guaranteed. Its a nearly complete roots styled album, and finally, producing this one is the legendary King Jammy.The mix of the two legendary artists in their own standing is a mix well worth the wait as they haven't (at least to my knowledge) collaborated on one of Sizzla's previous 40 or so studio albums. The result is one of Sizzla's finest efforts since 2002's Da Real Thing release.Jammy's didn't turn up the new material or turn Sizzla to protege's Ward 21 (as he had done previously with a Bushman release), instead he opened one of the most packed vaults to one of the wickedest lyricists JA has ever seen.Waterhouse Redemption is a fine fine album! The best tune here is probably the opener, the wicked One Love. Pure vintage Kalonji, you could take it off this one and drop it one of his earlier releases seamlessly, such as Royal Son of Ethiopia or Freedom Cry. Also check Someone Loves You, which is Sizzla riding the immortal Sleng Teng riddim. Its more of a typical Kalonji basic love tune, but it spreads very well and just hearing the artist tackle the Sleng Teng is wonderful enough.Also have to recommend some of the various beautiful love songs here. The best of which is probably the fine Lately I've Been Thinking, also love Love is the Way and Let Me Love You, over an old Frankie Paul riddim from Sarah. Love the tunes! They all have the old school feel giving Waterhouse Redemption a clear feeling of the better half of its most immediate predecessor, Ain't Gonna See Us Fall. Also really really love the Commandment tune, powerful track.Basically the entire album is might powerful with only the combinations feeling a little out of place. The r&b; feel of Ganja in My Brain with Tony Curtis and the nearly pure hip hop Street be Calling with Fahrenheit. But besides those (and neither is actually bad) Waterhouse Redemption is a real winner.Overall, DEFINITELY pick this one up. With the current swing of reggae music being to redo and rebirth the older riddims, having one of its greatest champions with one of its greatest trainers combining on nearly a complete retro album is huge! Should this swing continue, in a few years we may look back and call Waterhouse Redemption the crowning jewel of that movement. Yes, its that good.

And the reggae compilation wheel continues to spin at nearly light speed. If you can keep up, then you're a better music fan than I am. Dancehall compilations, roots compilations, mixes, oldies, ska, lover's rock, rasio stations. . . The list goes on and on and it takes the most discerning consumer to pick the best material worth his/her money.UK reggae giant label Jet Star has managed to stay at or near the top of the compilation race for a few years. They typically focus on the modern roots side of things and it doesn't get more modern than their Young Lions compilation. This installment, Vol. 2 (presumably the second of very very very many), features up and coming artists, Turbulence, Jah Mason, Fantan Mojah and Bascom X.X is by far the oddball hear. The other 3 artists having been more and more established and having albums; Mojah with his debut on the streets just last year, Jah Mason with 5 and Turbulence (at least at last count) had a whopping 12. So it is odd that the biggest boomshot of all the 14 tracks here comes from said freshman X. Farmer Brown is a beautiful story-like tune which shows the singjay in a style somewhat reminiscent of artists such as Turbulence and Sizzla.The strongest consistent showing on the album is easily by Mason who drops the most tunes (5) of any of the artist, and all of them are very fine, with perhaps the best being My Way (although Acres and Acres is very good). Fantan Mojah scores his best effort, easily, on Hard Nut to Crack (and somewhere the Silky one is smiling and bobbing his head). Turbulence shows his best on Stay Strong (which features wonderful singer Jahmali) over the resurrected Dis Ya Time riddim. Also check X's Badmind and Mojah's Don't Bow Out from his debut album Hail the King.Overall, judge this compilation based on the artist's involved alone. If you're a fan of them, scoop it up, none disappoint in the slightest and both Bascom X and Jah Mason consistently impress, and Turbulence and Mojah aren't too far behind. I actually do like the concept and plan to pick up Vol 1 (which featured Richie Spice, I Wayne, Chuck Fenda and Jah Cure). Making something like this which doesn't feature the constant names you find on such comps (although Turbulence is slowly but surely inching into that category) was a pretty good idea by Jet Star.

As if the music racks weren't already over-flowing with Sizzla studio cd's and greatest hits albums, throw Jet Star's 2nd Reggae Max album for the artist right in the group, and hail it as nothing spectacular, nothing that's going to make the world a better place, but definitely an interesting mixup of the artist's work.Sizzla's first tour of duty on the Reggae Max circuit was pretty good, actually, for the time, it was much better than this album is. . . I honestly don't know why this thing was released (besides to make money obviously) but it does have a place. If a person were to come up to me and ask me exactly which Sizzla album I would reccommend for them to get a feel of his style AS IT EXISTS TODAY (overall, I'd definitely say VP's Story Unfolds greatest hits double album) I might draw for this album, it has a definite mix of newer cultural material, dancehall material as well as a healthy dosage of his older styled roots tunes.Easily the best tune here (and the best on any album it should appear on perhaps ever) is Thank U Mamma, which I was actually surprised to see here as VP basically seemed to lock off the tune for its own (but Sizzla, unlike most reggae artists, owns his publishing, so he can lend it to whoever he wants to). But you see the pure mix on the album, on one end you have total gems such as the classic Jah Blessing with Luciano from the Freedom Cry/Kalonji album, epic massive tune; then on the other end you have a tune that I've been telling everyone about, the cool love tune Go Somewhere over the nice Father Jungle riddim, beautiful song!You have a song like the beautiful No Pain from the Black History album a few years ago, and the massive Blessing from the Red Alert/African Children album combined with classics such as Hail Selassie from Praise Ye Jah and Real and Good Ways. Like I said, the mix from new to old is very impressive. You even get into the areas where the artist drew criticism in the early 2000's, with slack tunes such as Dress Code and Give it to Dem. Then you have a beautiful tune in Half Has Never Been Told which sounds old but I can't put a finger on it, so I might go to declare it new, whatever it is, its a big tune and a plus to this album (incidentally if you know the tune, please do let me know, its mighty frustrating).Overall, no, we didn't need this one, if you're a fan you already own most of these tunes on album or 45 (and if you dont shame shame on you), but for the newer fan, you might want to pick this one up when you find yourself in the reggae section in your favourite record store and see nearly 40 different Sizzla albums on the shelf. Maybe starting here isn't a terrible idea.

The Ragga Ragga Ragga compilation from Greensleeves Records annually offers some of the most up to the time and hardest dancehall available anywhere. Everything is opened up, its totally uncensored and unforgiving and its probably one of the very few reggae/dancehall compilations you'll find anywhere that doesn't really try to fit in, it just gives you what the hardheads want in their ragga, usually.While the only exception to that on 2005's episode would be the Nina Sky and (Baby)Cham combination on Turnin' Me On which is even given a new shiney dancehall backing and totally worked out, the rest of the album is pretty straight forward, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The album is pretty stacked with very nice riddims, you have nearly the cream of the crop when it comes to up and coming producers including Vendetta, Birch, Scatta and Beenie Man's in house producer Mario C. All the artists come with their absolute hardest material (for the most part) and this newest edition fits in well with recent installments.Well then what's wrong with it? There really isn't a hammer here. There isn't really the one song that hits home on a level unlike the rest of the songs, and every album needs a hammer. With Greensleeves signees Macka Diamond and Vybz Kartel taking 7 of the 18 cuts, you would expect it would be somewhere in there. Diamond's tunes (for one reason or another) sound very similar to one another regardless of the riddim and Greensleeves seems to have specifically gone out of their way to find 4 Kartel songs which are amongst his dirtiest as the seemingly harmless sounding School Bus drifts and drifts and drifts. Spragga Korrection by Kartel, which is a song which goes out of its way to 'hide' its intended victim is truly one of the harshest clash songs you'll ever hear and at the end of it you walk away thinking somebody just got hit wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy below the belt.The other star hear with 3 tracks and the one who actually stills the show is the Doctor. Beenie's Three Laws, Ziggy Zung and Chaka Dance are very entertaining and never get stuck in the too slack role. Also shining is Capleton, expectedly, on Free Up, Sizzla in a Rah on I'm With the Girls and Mad Cobra who probably finds the album's best single spot on Switch.Overall, had they put one of Spragga's responses to Kartel on this album it probably would have offered a one-two hammer instead of just the one which I'm still looking for and just generally made the album more enjoyable. But Kartel is the big man at GS and he pretty much gets it his way. The RRR series has certainly seen better moments, but despite the average feel to this one, if you liked last year's and the year before that, you'll probably like 2005's as well.

Every time i hear Turbulence, I come away with the opinion that he is just getting better and consistently developing as an artist. He has made some SERIOUS progression as far as lyrical ability since i first hear him a few years back, and even when 2 years ago he released his album Rising, on VP, I thought he had reached his pinnacle, but I was wrong. I admit it.Different thing is a very very good album. Very rootsy, of course, thats Turbulence's natural way, but not so spiritual. Of course Rastaman writes Rasta songs, sings Rastaman lyrics and so forth, but you don't have to be a Rasta at all to enjoy tunes like the opener Girlfriend, I mean, that is just a part of life for basically everybody, its a very comforting tune, very well put together. &quot;Da Future&quot;, as he and others have now deemed him (rightly so), maintains a consistently very good singing voice (which is even better in concert) and on a song like Burn Dem Down with rising roots superstar Luton Fyah, Turbulence shows his incredible ability to wade between the worlds of djaying and singing without missing a step, the tune is a wicked wicked combination and one of the main reasons I bought this one. Also really like Pride, which is probably my favorite tune on the album, Leaders with Taffari, Dread Times with Mark Wonder and even the flat out strange sounding Holiday. Oh and Marihuana.. .. .. and Unite. I could say every tune here, there really are no bad songs.Overall, I say this is a definite one to get. You can certainly see the evidence of Turbulence's apprenticeship with Kalonji, especially in his writing. With so many young great roots artists prospering in Reggae music right now along with Turbulence, like Jah Cure, Warrior King, Luton Fyah and others, Turbulence with his overall talent, consistent recording schedule, great stage presence, the backing that he has (namely Xterminator) and 3 very very good albums under his belt, seems poised to be &quot;Da Future&quot; and then some when he is called upon to do so. Different Thing is not too different from what we're used to from the artist, which is a good thing. GO GET IT!

(4.5 Stars)A quite wonderful surprise I experience when I somewhat randomly and pointlessly searched Jah Mason's name on Amazon to find out that they were now carrying the Unlimited album along with the wicked Never Give Up album (perhaps his greatest effort to date) from 2004. Unlimited is one of the finest albums from this young veteran reggae artist who is perhaps destined to be fully underappreciated and underrated.Mason probably ranks right next to Junior Kelly in terms of what they are in the music. Despite numerous hits from both, they can't seem to break into the Capleton/Sizzla/Anthony B/Luciano ranks, but both are seemingly qualified as they have the skill definitely. In Mason's specific case, his talent is more of a melodic one which is odd. He can manipulate his harsh sounding voice to seemlessly match the most laid back of one drops. And his experience dictates that as well, a veteran of both JR Records under Junior Reid, and David House, under Capleton (whom he sounds like at times), he has served an 'apprenticeship' matched by very very few of his peers.The Unlimited album was probably Mason's hardest (at last count he had 6, Unlimited was the 2nd released). It has a predominately dancehall (and slight hip-hoppish) vibe throughout, specifically through the first half. The artist himself is never more solid lyrically as he absolutely locks off the flow on several tunes on Unlimited. Probably the single best tune here is the flawless All I Can See on which the country bwoy Mason reasons "I'm sitting here looking at the trees, I'm look at the birds and the bees and all I can see is LOVE!".The best of the fine rest consist of the awesome condemnatory Si Dem Move; the wicked title track; big big Rasta tune Vegetable Time; E-Mail. I could go on and on defintely. Lyrically the best tune here is without a doubt No Token. There are no bad tunes and the album ends with 2 impressive combinations with Ian Sweetness and Don Angelo on De Youths Dem Ballin and No Limit respectively. Also check the really smooth How Long, very very impressive.Overall, that's the story of the Unlimit1ed album, when this one was actually released I would have probably given it a 5 star review. Today, it may lack that dominant one drop that I need on a roots record, but the production is top notch throughout, and it is a straight forward roots project. Mason never steps into slackness. If you're looking for that rare mix of competent, world class roots mixed with dancehall of a similar quality, check Unlimited, its nearly a masterpiece.

I may at some various points in my life tire of hearing the foot lifting, flag waving vibes of soca music and even the headrocking, booty shaking dancehall vibes. At some point you just need a break from something that relentless. However, 100% of any time you may catch me anywhere, I will always be in the mood for a good roots reggae tune. No matter the artist, no matter the country of origin and no matter the producer, of all my musical interests, the strongest is that straight one drop, I love it!Enter Bambu Station, one of the finest roots collectives in the entire world. Joining the ranks of the legendary Midnite band, Bambu Station, hailing from the VI has made quite a name for themselves outside of the mainstream of Jamaican reggae making some of the finest and well polished vibes availables anywhere. The group hails from both St Thomas and St Croix which makes available to them some of the finest young talent in all of reggae music.That serves a great purpose on Talkin' Roots 2 which is essentially a compilation of various artists voicing on different Bambu Station backed riddims. The artists are all from various parts of the Virgin Islands and they are all artists to watch in the future. I love the way the album is set up because, even if you have being paying attention to that vibe growing in the VI this album will introduce you to several new names.The best song here without a doubt is the well powerful My Powaz by St Thomas native Pressure. Pressure's debut, The Pressure is On was the finest reggae debut album I heard all of 2005 and to see him in such fine form on another release confirms that his label didnt just pick some of his best tracks, but that is the way he makes music , Pressure maybe the main artist to watch on this entire album.Also check the fine lovers rock tune Never Change My Mind by unknown (to me) Lady Passion from St Croix. The song is so laid back and tamed that it works on so many levels besides the typical vibes on most of these tracks. I'm also quite impressed (even though I was subsequently less impressed by his album) with Ijah Menelik's from Montserrat well powerful Baggawire, the song is a nice introduction to the artist (just avoid his debut album) as he does a fine job.Also check the Star Lion Family collective, which includes the aforementioned Pressure, and one of the few artists from this project to have released a solo album (2 to date) Niyorah, on Hold the Faith (also check their EP, Brighter Days). I also like Ras Bumpa's well polished vibes on Do Good as well as Danny I going Vaughn Benjamin on his Dem No Tired.Overall, I feel pride in this release. As a Jamaican native and someone who splits his time between JA and St Maarten, this album makes me proud to be West Indian! There is a ton of fine fine young and established acts emerging, CONSCIOUSLY, from the Caribbean, giving a mighty praise to my generation, yes we do get the point of being conscious and responsible, it is a necessity. But apart from that, Talkin Roots 2 is just a big album! Make no mention that Bambu Station's efforts are top notch, all of these riddims are very well done and very well produced. Definitely gets my seal of approval!

General Degree has long been one of my absolute favorite Dj's to listen to. I like the straight-forwardness of his style, there aren't really any pitfalls, you never turn on a General Degree vibe and feel shocked or suprised by what you're hearing, and if you ever find that you are, its only because the song itself is really really good. So, I'm partial, so take it into consideration when I tell you:I LOOOOOOOOOOVE THE GENERAL ALBUM! The only complaint I can make here, which isn't really a complaint at all is that there is no combination with Degree prodige' Chrissy D, the two always make for more than interesting links, but I digress. The General is probably the best overall party dancehall album I've heard since the real Sean Paul stepped forth on his debut, Stage One. The best tune here is the wildly addictive Dutty River, genuine GD stylee, straight forth nice lyrics, ridiculous flow, just a really strong vibe.Also really interesting here is the tune Deh Yah, which features the newest digital conquest of super-producer Lenky. At least as interesting as Deh Yah is Nah Flex Right with the incomparable Beres Hammond, also love the opener Empire, Hold On Pon Him on which Degree just locks off the flow. Dance With U with the always interesting young voiced singer Chico is a nice tune, as is Do U Feel Alright, a combination with underrated and underrated appreciated dj Desperado, their styles are somewhat similar and the tune really comes off. I just really love this album, even like the straight up soca Chaka Chaka tune Good Time.Overall, The General is almost an ode to all true General Degree fans. Its his style on full display, and the artist does not disappoint one bit. If you're not typically a fan of Degree's but you do enjoy dancehall, or even you're a new fan of the music whose just recently started listening, I'd recommend this one. Its straight forward, honest amazing dancehall by one of its greatest sons.

If you heard a clean version of the Engine riddim and then looked up the artists who voiced on it, you can almost tell how the complete album would sound. The Engine was produced in 2001 by King Jammy's son CJ, and it didn't really produce a big dancehall hit to its name, several solid songs and underground hits, but nothing that really locked off teh dance.The problem with the album as a whole would be the rather odd artist selection CJ did. The riddim itself is a very hard bass-driven piece, which sounds not terribly unlike something that would come out of Ward 21's studio (and they, unsurprisingly served as engineers on the Engine). Thus, its somewhat similar and reminiscent of the massive Bellyas, but nowhere near that complete, and you can imagine that with a title such as the Engine, it would be pretty hard. So why do you role down the list of names and see Anthony Cruz, whose song I've Been Waiting is almost cursed from the very beginning as he says "This one is for my princess!", well then you really should've picked a different riddim for this tune Anthony!Also out of place is Wayne Wonder who does a nice effort on his Nah Go Nice and its the only tune on which the riddim actually ever so slighty changes, but its glued to the Engine and it would have sounded infinitely better over a less hardcore riddim. Also equally out of place is Daville on his Girl You Know, which you dont even have to wait to the first line (I really want to know your name) to know that the soft voiced Daville is just bad for the Engine. That is all accompanied by several tunes which are just bad, such as Yes by Frisco Kid and the wholly unspectacular Lyrics by the wholly unspectacular dj Galaxy P. And Ele's Bun Him a Gi Yuh sounds like a. . . dirty Mother Goose rhyme.So what's good here? The straight forward artists rule this one easily. There isn't perhaps an artist better suited in the dance to ride the engine than Bounty Killer who goes about aiming his gun at just about everyone on his No Fear. If anyone is better for the Engine than Bounty, its undoubtedly Mad Cobra and his Batta Ears is one of the best tunes on the album. Ward 21's dirty Bed Room Bully is pretty clever even though most of the Ward doesn't even take it on.The overall best tune here however, is probably Spragga's Lick Dem Head as he actually manages to suck a melody out of the not-so melodic Engine. Also check Kartel's Big Man, typical Kartel fitting in his standard 20 extra words per verse than the average dj; If a War by Assassin, even near his beginning 'Sassin manages to do a fine job on the second best tune on the album completely; And Saw proves she's more than capable than playing tuff when the occassion calls for it on her Blessings in Disguise over her boyfriend's riddim.Overall, I don't rather knwo how to classify the Engine riddim album as whole, besides saying its something only for those who really enjoy their dancehall hardcore and extreme. If you're not that, then this one will get very monotonous, very quickly for you. So for dancehall heads only.

Perhaps doomed or cursed, or even gifted, depending on how you look at it, Assassin will forever be linked to Vybz Kartel, his entirely more popular and infamous `classmate'. The two young (although I don't think I'm calling Kartel `young' anymore) DJ's emerged on the scene at relatively the same time, under relatively similar situations (both being the disciples of veteran acts, Kartel of Bounty Killer and Assassin of Spragga Benz) and both were talented to the point where dancehall aficionados almost immediately begin to pair the two together in hopes of seeing who would eventually become the real big man of dancehall. Well, just a few years later and. . . Well we really aren't sure what to make of these two and there is yet another two (Busy Signal and Aidonia) who we are now spending our time considering. From since that time Vybz Kartel has placed himself amongst Jamaica's truly elite dancehall artists. His style of dancehall, an ultra hype, macho, slack and violent brand which he delivers in a style which is his signature tongue twisting and highly unorthodox and nearly demonic rhyming schemes. The lyrics machine from Portmore has also set himself as one of the most controversial dancehall artists in the music's history (and that's saying a lot with allllllllll the characters we've had over the years), engaging in lyrical (and sometimes physical) wars with nearly EVERY prominent dancehall artist on the scene on one level or another (including Assassin) , Kartel's road to his destination in music is VERY different from the road Assassin has taken. Probably the largest piece of controversy attached to Assassin's name over the last few years has been a split from longtime manager/producer Donovan Germain of the legendary Penthouse Studios. Otherwise, besides becoming a young father and making headlines by being chosen for a prominent scholarship to attend a business school in the UK, the first scholar of dancehall has remained relatively out of the bright shining spotlight of dancehall controversies over the past few years. Musically speaking, he has remained sharp, in the two (very brief) years since his long awaited debut album in 2005, Infiltration, Assassin has remained amongst the highest regarded artists in dancehall, and while he has lacked the sick flare of his better known `rival' in Kartel, he has bested Kartel in the one category of consistency which is definitely a rare quality in dancehall. Actually, he has mirrored his mentor, Spragga Benz (who also has a new album out now), in terms of their rise to prominence: Spragga Benz came about in the days of the rise of peers Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Buju Banton, and Mad Cobra and a few more higher profile artists, but it took nothing away from his own skills, for he was truly wicked.Such is the case for the now seemingly slightly forgotten Assassin. While, during his early career, there was the name Vybz Kartel alongside his, in the past few years where his prolificacy has dipped (although he has still consistently scored hits with his slightly less active recording), several names have emerged as a few have even returned. Names now around, like the seriously wick Aidonia, the tongue twisting Busy Signal and the demonic singer Mavado weren't around when `Sassin emerged. Neither were names like Munga Honourable and dancehall prince Baby Cham, to whom Assassin was so frequently compared was on his break from the business and now there is the young genius Bramma, who is so frequently compared to the `elder' Assassin. Elbow room has become a premium amongst the dancehall elite. There have also been entrances from the elite of other avenues of dancehall music into the artists arena. Soundman Tony Matterhorn is now much in demand as an artist as is dancer turned DJ Ding-Dong and countless others crossing over. The production side of things has changed as well with certain names coming into the game who weren't around when Assassin came up, and luckily, his name being as big as it is, he has managed quite well to have doors open for him which seem reserved to the more active (particularly the younger and more active) names in the business. Assassin's `absence' from the scene has definitely aided these younger artists in it being less crowded at the top and more room for them to gain attention and to gain popularity in much the same fashion as Baby Cham's brief absence aided the young Assassin when he was coming up. Well, as Cham so famously announced on the track which marked his return to the game (fittingly titled The Return) `the break is over' and this time its over for Assassin who returns with his sophomore album, Gully Sit'n: A Dancehall Story. Assassin's first album, the long awaited Infiltration reached in 2005 and was fairly critically acclaimed as it showed the young DJ off as more than someone befitting his stage moniker. Infiltration was a particularly well done album, especially for a dancehall debut, and it went to showoff that despite still being very young, Assassin had developed to the point, where unlike Kartel, he could craft a tune which had topics other than gals, guns or bling. Although Infiltration did contain its fair share of girls and bling (very low on the guns however, if I recall correctly), it went to show on such tunes as the very wicked social commentary Free At Last and Youths Well Cold, a combination with legendary singer Freddie McGregor (the McGregor family has certainly been good to `Sassin). The album also contained the rather clever hit Idiot Thing That which was done in a way which seemingly followed along the lines of any other dancehall track, but to this day I suggest you really go and listen to the lyrics of that song which were definitely not your typical dancehall tune. Ultimately, Assassin's debut album featured a song named Wandering Mind which is amongst his very best and helped show that neither was this your typical DJ.Now, a rather long two years later we get the follow up to Infiltration, Assassin's sophomore album, Gully Sit'n. Named after the ridiculously wicked tune which became his signature track in between albums, Gully Sit'n is a very strong dancehall album, while it does suffer ever so slightly from the sophomore jinx and doesn't quite reach the stratosphere set by the Infiltration album. The vibe here is much more of the typical dancehall album, but, as I mentioned, when you are truly wicked, you can pretty much do anything and still be solid. If you have never heard Assassin I typically refer to his style of DELIVERY as a mixture between Baby Cham and mentor Spragga Benz. He's not the baritone, rock and chisel voiced DJ as Cham is at his best, nor is he as free flowing as Spragga was in his younger days, but somewhere directly in the middle. Lyrically, he definitely doesn't resemble young Spragga whose major talent was turning some of the craziest and slackest tunes that you'll ever hear in the dancehall (which is seriously saying A LOT), he much more closely reminds you of Baby Cham in that he tackles a variety of topics and tackles them equally well (remember young Cham with tunes like Desperate Measures and Ghetto Pledge and of course more recent with nearly all of his major hits being of the social commentary variety). I'll also say this about Assassin, although definitely naturally gifted, he has been one of the very few artists who have developed over the time spent in the game, again, much like Baby Cham (and this isn't just me, dancehall genius Dave Kelly rarely ever adds a new name to the camp and the one young DJ not signed to his Madhouse labels who is afforded Dave Kelly riddims is Assassin).Gully Sit'n the album checks in at a well stacked twenty tracks and it is for the serious dancehall head only. The album begins with the Count Up Intro which is seriously one of the coolest tunes on the album, pretty much a straight freestyle and almost completely expected, I still enjoyed it and it gets the album off on a nice foot. Then it gets funny. As has unfortunately been VP's style over the past year or two (check Gyptian`s album and Turbulence`s Notorious album), Gully Sit'n the tune has been re-recorded and while its still enjoyable, having heard the original, it is a full step down (if you haven't heard the original seek out the well available video) and that was a flat out disappointment, VP needs to deliver the song in the method it was made popular and not in a spruced up, and downright less `gully' version. That was the one real disappointment (I had one more I'll tell you in a minute), other than that Gully Sit'n is just what you would expect, Assassin's take on most of the newer and popular riddims, with a few twists. The one serious twist is the track The Pain. The Pain is a very moving track in tribute to Assassin's mother who passed away after the release of his debut album. it's the type of track I would have probably declared him unable to produce just as recent as a few years ago as it comes off as just him pouring out his heart over a minimal riddim and he's basically talking and accompanied by the occasional (yet still very beautiful) female backing singer who compliments The Pain very well, giving it an angelic vibe, definitely need to check that one out! Perhaps the best part about being an artist at the forefront of the dancehall scene is the virtual line of top producers you have to choose from and Gully Sit'n takes full advantage. Names like not only today's `usual suspects' in Don Corleone, Stephen McGregor and Lenky (who has also apparently linked Assassin as one of his favorite DJ's to use on his riddims) but he is also afforded BOTH the legendary Kelly brothers, Dave and Tony. One of the more interesting tracks here is definitely Girls Alone Wi Want over Lenky's downright ODD Swazi riddim. The tune has that odd addictive vibe to it that most of Lenky's productions have. `Sassin has his take on McGregor's ridiculous Tremor riddim and quietly pushes one of the best tracks on the loaded riddim with his We Love the Girls. And for one of the wickedest pieces on Gully Sit'n check Assassin militaristic take on Corleone's Artillery riddim, current hit Don't Mek Wi Hold You, probably the single biggest hit on the album; he also gets his take on the brilliant Silver Screen riddim from Vendetta with his seriously MASSIVE Dem a Sissy, probably my choice for the album's second best tune overall, complete with its hilarious intro. Also nicely included are previous hits Anywhere We Go and Good Over Evil for Dave Kelly's Eighty Five and Stage Show riddims, respectively. And you need check no further than one of the best tunes on the album, Don't Dis No Man from last year over Tony Kelly and Danny Champagne's old school vibed VIP riddim.My choice for the best track on Gully Sit'n however, is definitely the criminally wicked Dem Pop Down. Dem Pop Down shows off everything I got in listening to the Infiltration album, it would have been tunes like this from this album which would have been completely at home on that album. The tune has an old school vibe and is `camouflaged' as a typical dancehall tune, but listen carefully to this one as it makes a rather interesting point to those seeking the finer and more material possessions in life. And per his style at his best, `Sassin absolutely locks it off and hypnotizes with the lyrics on that one. Other tracks to check out definitely include the odd Fiesta riddim sounding Rail Up. Rail Up is seriously one of the best tracks here, very addictive, probably the biggest sing-a-long style tune on the album and its quite easy to go along with and one of the more slack tunes on Gully. Check the sick No Boring Gal over Birch's ultra hype Stage Time riddim one of the stronger tracks here. And lastly two MASSIVE shots from later in the album check the overkill Gun Bag, by this time in the album you've well gotten into the dancehall vibe and Gun Bag is just good old fashion dancehall guilty pleasure! The album ends with Beep Out, `Sassin take on the current large Bluetooth riddim, definitely needs to be heard.I could have probably made quite a nice album with his more recent work which was left off the album as well. As he has gotten closer to releasing the album, predictably he has become more and more active and the MASSIVE shot which was left off Gully Sit'n, All Over the World over John John's Big Up riddim would have done quite nice (one of those absolutely horrid interlude's could have been left off).Overall, while I didn't quite get what I expected from Gully Sit'n: A Dancehall Story, the journey through is still very enjoyable. As I said before, this one is strictly for the well initiated dancehall heads I can't imagine that sitting through 20 tracks of this would be too enjoyable for any other type of fan. While Assassin had been missing from the scene over the past year or so, Gully Sit'n marks the return to prominence of one of dancehall seriously talented prince's, all fans of the genre need pay attention.

Despite the fact that I had longed marked Da'ville as one of the best new and up and coming pure singing dancehall talents to have emerged in JA within the last decade, I had a REALLY bad feeling when I received his debut album, In Heaven. Daville had originally released In Heaven here through his own label, which had virtually no distribution outside of the Caribbean, and as his name continued to grow through making solid hits, he went the more frequent route today of signing with a Japanese label to release his debut.I think that's what made me not to keen on the whole thing.Recently, established dancehall acts Ward 21 and Voicemail have also chosen to go the route of releasing through a Japanese label and the results have been bad, AT BEST! Why such an established act as Ward 21 would have to leave Greensleeves (well, that part is no mystery) to go to a Japanese label to release the TERRIBLE King of the World (take into account that ultimately both Voicemail and now Da'ville's albums were ultimately picked up by a Western label, which is a distinction nowhere in site for King of the World) is a mystery to me; as well as why the up and coming Voicemail, who was only months away from signing a deal with VP, would chose that route for their less than stellar debut Hey (which was ultimately shaved of some of the filler material, before reaching the west).However, Da'ville, former lead of the fine harmony group ARP has apparently broken the 'curse' of the Japanese reggae labels as he released In Heaven, his official debut album. The role of dancehall singer is an often underrated one in modern times as very few of our PURE singers chose that route, opting more for the rootical side of the music (not that I'm complaining) and Da'ville has definitely given a shot in the arm to that style of artist.Acting as executive producer, Da'ville has concocted a marvelous album which, perhaps its finest quality in my opinion, seeks to be absolutely nothing but a reggae album. There are no overt attempts at crossover at all on In Heaven (barely any at all), he approached the album with the idea of making a nice dancehall album and that is exactly what you get when you pick up In Heaven.The best tune here is probably the divine title track, a previous #1 hit for the young veteran. The self produced record created a very nice stir here and really has one of the biggest vibes you should here from any young singer as Da'ville taps into the Sanchez/Wayne Wonder level on the track. The other truly exceptional track here is without a doubt the second of the two combinations, the lovely All My Life on which Da'ville shows off with one of the true pillars of the reggae industry, the legendary Marcia Griffiths. The two do a fine and well powerful duet that should've definitely received more spins than it did.Other standouts include the outstanding opener, Mama's Portrait. Backed by a mighty Firehouse riddim, the obligatory Mama tune is one of the album's finest works and goes a lot further in truly making a beautiful song, than just bigging up Da'ville's mom. Also check the nice nice My Grade over Frenchie's cut of the World Jam riddim (aka the Jamrock), Da'ville had one of the finest efforts on the riddim altogether and My Grade still stands out. Check Chill definitely the nice acoustic track which just makes you want to. . . chill.Inna hardcore dancehall stylee, Da'ville still holds his own. Check the high powered Gallis which did quite well and became a nice hit for the artist for its anthemic type of feel. Here it is given and ever so slight refashioning over Firelinks sickly hype Mad Instruments riddim and it fits in well on the album. Check Jump Off for Vendetta over his stellar French Vanilla riddim, the song takes a much more melodic route than most of the other hardcore tunes on the riddim, and it is a fine mixup for the album. But the best hardcore track her is easily the massive Hey Baby, one of his other #1's over, the song is extremely magnetic and will have you up and moving guaranteed!Finally, before I forget, two really big tracks, later in the album. Check Weh She Want and Love Will Show me the way. Da'ville's true strength lies in voicing over the modern dancehall one drops, and he does it exceedingly well.Overall, definitely recommending this album and its updated and even stronger Western version. The album is one of the finer dancehall pieces of 2005 altogether and very impressive for the young veteran and shows he may in a short time have the skills to rate with such artists as the classy Wayne Wonder and timeless Sanchez. His style does fit into a very neo-style of dancehall as well as within the current trend of 'revibing' older material as well. Within the next couple of years, Da'ville will be a HUGE artist, and In Heaven shows that definitely.

If you haven't yet heard Thank U Mamma by Sizzla, then you need to. Its that good of a song, one of his best and if you know anything about the artist, then you know that's hard to be because he has some amazing songs. The lyrics are perfect. It shows you how good this song is that VPRecords decided to release it on a cd and thats the first time that Sizzla has had a single on cd in the US, after 20+ US releases. The cd contains the song itself, and the just the riddim which is beautful as well. And it contains the video which is the main reason i bought it, despite already owning the album on which it appears (Da Real Thing). The video is very good, very humble, and actually shows his beautiful mother and his equally beautiful wife and children. If you can't get enuff of this artist, or if you're new to the reggae sound, try this one out, definitely, you will not be disappointed.

It seems like a really long time ago now that Lion/Roaring Lion roamed the legendary halls of Xterminator studios. Since his apparent vanishing artists such as Chezidek and Turbulence (who weren't Xterminator artists at the time)(especially Turbulence) have ascended to higher levels than he himself was, at his peak. And the former head man of Xterminator during Lion's time, Sizzla Kalonji has sailed into the reggae stratosphere. And Prince Malachi even has disappeared himself, only to reappear in 2004.Seemingly the last time this artist was heard from was in 2000 when he guested on labelmate Turbulence's reggae major debut, Rising on the excellent I Don't Know. It is unfortunate however, because all it takes a cursory listen to this album, his 1998 debut to see his apparently high talent level. His style is nothing at all special, however in his straight-forwardness lies an ability to hog-tie his flows to some of the best late 90's Xterminator riddims to come down the road.Probably the best of the 11 tracks that comprise Roaring Lion is the closer, Babylon Burn Down which almost comes off as a party song for the Xterminator "anywhere yu see Lion, Luci, Fred Locks and Sizzla, Babylon bun dung lak Rizzla!". Its a different way to approach the typical burn babylon song and it comes off well. Also really like Saw Them, which is almost a dancy song but with Lion's ever-present good message. Selassie a God, Judgement (I think every artist ever to come down Xterminator has had a tune named Judgement or with some slight variation). And LOVE Will There be Peace.Overall, I'd probably categorize Lion's style more derivative of Buju Banton than Sizzla with whom is most often compared, at times he comes off exactly as new age Buju. This album went very unheralded, it wasn't until his second album (even furtherly confusely titled Roaring, after he had dropped 'Roaring' from his offical performing name) that he had began to receive attention, and although that album was somewhat overlooked, it was still widely critically acclaimed. With his style, however, there isn't much difference between the 2 and surely if you enjoyed the second, tracking down this hard to find gem will prove more than worth it for you.

The biggest thing that prevents this record form getting a 5 star rating is without a doubt the track Fire Dance, which I guess is supposed to be like reggae hokey-pokey, and its terrible! A BOBO doing a song like that is just so unexcusable. That being said, there is no other weak track on the record, (while I can't say that I like the song Good Life, its still a decent cut.) My favorite song here is without a doubt Black Coffee, where Anthony B, does absolutely nothing but bigup the black woman, its easily his best song, besides Fire Pon Rome of course. I also like All God's Children, Rally Round and I Will Never Bow Down with the brilliant Stephen Marley. Overall, like I said, minus Fire Dance its a very good record. Listen to it on a portable cd player or on a remote controlled stereo system, so you won't have to get up to skip track # 6. Good stuff.

Approximately 3 days a year I'll go into my musical 'closet' and pull out some of the older gems that I haven't heard in ages and just vibe out for an entire week. My closet is literally CRAWLING with riddim albums of riddims which I barely remember if I even ever heard at all. Most of these albums are in fact still encased in their original plastic over packages and I can't remember when or where I picked them up.Such was was the case yesterday when going through the closet I came across one of my FAVORITE riddims of about 3-4 years ago, Richie Stephens' Caribbean Style from his Pot of Gold Productions. I'm not a fan of PoG's so the Caribbean Style might be the only thing I have ever purchased by Stephens' (unless he was behind the MASSIVE Slow Down De Pace and I can't remember, but I loved that riddim!). But I used to LOOOOOOVE the Caribbean style. It had a kinda of aggressive bounce to it and it made use of excellent artist selection by Stephens as artists, new and established who could ride such a riddim effortlessly were strictly employed.The riddim doesn't change all that much (save for the weird horn on Kiprich's decent Hot Girls), but it's nearly as fun as the Diwali riddim album (probably my favorite ever) and the recent Chinkuzi which is just absolutely crazy, you can have a good time vibing to the Caribbean Style riddim.Interestingy, the best tune over this new, exciting and fresh riddim comes from an older artist, from a the 'golden era' of dancehall. Professor Nuts absolutely MURDERS the Caribbean Style riddim with his God Damn It, in typically Nuts' hilarious style. He, amongst all the artists here, seem the most out of place (except for maybe DYCR on his curiously odd for the riddim Lap Dance), but the Caribbean Style would have considerably less style had he not been tapped by Stephens to voice it.I'm not even going to sit here and do my usual and warn against the Wayne Marshall tune, Roll Deep, as it is very impressive, one of the better tunes from Mr Marshall and although I am nowhere near being a fan, I definitely have to give credit there. Of course riddims like these were made for artists like General Degree and Beenie Man and they both OWN the CS, Degree over his fittingly titled Reggae Dancehall, just a huge celebratory anthemic style tune which Degree has made a career out of perfecting; And Beenie with Crissy D (perhaps on loan from Degree, j/k) on the awesome Ohh La La La! Love that record taking the melody from a Fugee's track and working it nicely.Also check Bounty's solo effort Try Again; Assassin's nearly massive Yard Man, and a stage still well within his development from 3+ years ago, its interesting to see the promise still there and prominent in this young artist before becoming what he is now, a lyrical wizard. And lastly, I'll recommend a few spins for Lady G's Respect Woman, always nice to see one of the original 'Lady's' of the dance in fine form.Overall, I'll definitely recommend picking up the Caribbean Style. You can probably, at this point, find it in the half off bin of your local Caribbean music store, well well worth it! It sounds a lot like vintage Lenky, perhaps most reminding me of the Masterpiece (very similar to the Masterpiece actually) with a dash of Diwali and from that same rather short 'era' where dancehall became about having a little bit more fun than was necessary. The Caribbean Style isn't exactly necessary, but its much much FUN.

Is there a more overlooked big artist in Jamaica than Junior Kelly? Jah Mason maybe? Maybe Determine? Or maybe even Bushman? If the title of JA's most underappreciated doesn't belong to Kelly, then he's right up there. The artist has consistently turned in big tunes and big albums and is constantly overlooked by his peers such as Sizzla (to whom he's most often compared) and Capleton, and even by the newer crop of hitmakers such as Turbulence and Fantan Mojah.He remains, however, perhaps the single most consistent roots artist on the scene (with respect to Luciano), his music is always at a certain level and he's one of the few distinctively reggae artists who don't try to overstep the reggae 'boundaries'.His newest album, VP's Tough Life, is very very impressive, I'd venture to say his best in a few years and one of his best ever. The opener and title track is one of the highlights and one of the big sound roots anthems you've come to expect from the artist, just big beautiful sounding reggae music. Also check the excellent Rasta Should Be Deeper, again, big anthemic sounding tune with a fantastic message.The big pre-release tune on this one was Receive which became a JA #1 (and probably is the reason TL came out when it did) and it is a really big tune and one of the album's best. However, the real story about Tough Life is the 'toughness' of the middle tracks on the album. Beginning with the literal highlight here, which is Hold the Faith, a wicked refashioning of an old Dennis Brown hit and it features the chilling vocals from the late great Crown Prince himself.Also in that run of tunes is the excellent Youths Dem Nah Cool which begins in typical Kelly fashion only to 'ascend' to near music perfection as Kelly abandons the typical chanting on the second verse and just begins talking directly to the youths of the world, its really a big big tune that you need to hear. The album's best tune however, is Satan Throne. The song just climbs at the beginning and eventually blows out to a luxuries anthemic melody and is actually one of the best tunes Kelly has ever recorded, you can literally replay it several times and not tire of that one tune alone. Later in the album a Kelly production, Ease My Pain becomes one of the better tunes on the album.Overall, if you really love the reggae music, this is your album. It is almost painfully consistent and Kelly never wavers from his devotion to the music, nor his devotion to it at nearly its highest level. Tough Life is steady, maybe not spectacular, but that's the perfect way to describe the artist as well, and if you're a fan of Junior Kelly, then you will LOVE Tough Life.

Quiet as kept, Wheat and Tears is (by this count) Jah Mason's 8th full length studio album and with the 8th different producer (#9 will make 9 different producers as its done for Frenchie at Maximum Sound). The man simply gets around, but despite his ronin like recording schedule he has yet to garnish the type of attention enjoyed by several of his bigger named peers although he is more than capable of seeing them all in terms of ability, he's just a curiously overlooked artist, you would think there would be more attention surrounding him, even to the point that a few of his earlier releases (Surprise Dem and Most Royal) were never released in the US.Not that you can tell by listening to him however. Mason himself is a feverish social activist on the mic, even his laid back tunes sound hi-tech because of his raspy loud vocals, but down here, you go to most of the country, and even over other similar but more well known artists like Kalonji and Capleton, Jah Mason's records reign. Although you hear the urgency within him on every tune, there's always a connection to something simpler, as opposed to the Kgn. based dj's.His latest release, Wheat and Tears, is his third album of 2007 and its the second best of the year (after RiSE) and one of the better of his entire career (although not as good as the MASTERCLASS which is Never Give Up or the solid truck which is Most Royal). Its pretty typical Jah Mason who has grown nice in building an album. The best tune is the opener and title track without a doubt. Wheat and Tears is a well powerful tune and I can almost see Greensleeves motioning when choosing it as the title track for the album. Also check the super-wicked Farmer Man which is one of the harder, yet most clever tunes on the entire album.The album is sort of split into 2 different vibes which seems to be becomming the norm these days. The first half is decidedly a harder vibe than the second. On the second, my favourite song (and second favourite song on the album altogether is the nice nice King of Kings, wonderful tune, as is Let Me Live My Life and previous well powerful single Mi Chalwa (they just couldn't put Team Up here could they?!). Also check earlier wicked tune No Time and Couple Chalice a Day (which sounds like a good idea for us all!Probably because I've been inundated with Jah Mason's music lately, there is a really strong vibe with Wheat and Tears. A little more than his typical natural aggression, although Greensleeves will undoubtedly turn its greatest promotion efforts to push forward its most recent dancehall signee, Busy Signal, Wheat and Tears is a well powerful vibe indeed.Overall, place this album near the top of Mason's catalogue and definitely scoop it up. He seems to go the route of releasing a few one year and none for the next couple of years so, maybe they'll save #9 for 2007. There's definitely enough powerful and conscious material out for the overlooked Mason. JUST LOOK FOR IT! You'll enjoy it definitely, if you don't, call my house!

Along with Brickwall, Jetstar is jumping to the forefront of roots and Rasta renaissance albums, and dropping seriously high quality material like the Five Disciples album does nothing to hinder their reputation.Solid is the word that best describes this album. What prevents it from being a 5 star album is the 6 tracks between 5 artists, thats an uneven split to where both Prophet and Luciano only have 2 tracks, and Anthony B, Kalonji and Junior Kelly split the other 12 songs at 4 apiece. My point is that there should have been 20 tracks, 4 apiece.Anyway,what is actually pon the album is very good, being a huge Capleton fan and an even bigger Sizzla fan, getting this one was absolute for me, but I have to admit that the original Anthony B nearly steals the show on this one, the best of his cuts is the brutal Hide &amp; Duck, straight dancehall genius and glad to see Anthony B tearing it up again (if you haven't heard his amazing Love So Divine, check it out immediately). No Man Can Try is also very very good. Junior Kelly also rules it with some new music from his new album (Conscious Voice also a Jetstar production)his best being Them &amp; Those, and I also like Come One Day, pretty good lyrics on that one. Not being a fan at all of Luciano, I still recognize his False Prophet sound as being an excellent tune. From the Prophet check out first High Grade on the hip-hop beat as he tears through completely. The jewel here, however, is Kalonji, Legendary is on the album. Legendary is an imperial tune as it is far and away the best song here, and that is a hard thing to be. Also check his brand new Jerusalem, which is so good that I bought the single. Overall, I say pick this one up if you are a fan of Rasta music. Its also a good album to have, I would imagine, if you are a slight or a new fan of the music.

I purchased the European version of Anthony B's Live on the Battlefield, and it has been in and out of my cd player for the last 2 or 3 years. All these years later and it has finally been made available to reggae fans around the world, and be you one of these said fans, you need do yourself a favour and scoop this one up.When I got this one; I remember the first thing that I said is what an excellent idea, take an artist in his prime, who has not a problem getting an album released (case and point on the same day this one is released, he has another one out) and do something different with him. A double live album is quite a change in reggae music as it seems only the older artists (i.e. Marley, Burning Spear, Dennis Brown etc.) can have such a project. Live albums at all: Can you remember the last one done top notch from a modern artist? Sizzla's had a live disc on his Words of Truth album, Bushman, Luciano, Everton Blender. . . and I'm stuck right there, I'm sure there are more, but the shelves of reggae music are not overflowing with an abundance of live reggae pieces, and the live album (particularly in reggae music) is often easier to appreciate than your typical studio production.Anthony B (as always) delivers a fine performance; this one in front of a large audience in Toulouse, France. Beautifully backed by the Star Trail Band, B rips through many of his hits. The first disc here is absolutely loaded with the hits that his fans will know like the back of their hands. Universal Struggle, Raid The Barn, Mr Heartless, Swarm Me, and of course Fire Pon Rome. If you forced me to pick a favourite, I'd have to say that Raid the Barn is the peak of the first disc, but definitely, its a cd that you let play completely through, no filler.The second disc is a little more laid back than the energetic first one. And you get such tunes as Prophecy a Reveal, Damage, Jerusalem, Storm Winds, and what is in my opinion the best tune on disc 2, Fireman. (Love the performance of the seminally wicked Give Thanks as well). The album is also much of a dedication to the late great 'Steppin Razor' Peter Tosh and B delves into covers of Johnny B Good and Equal Rights from Tosh.Overall, if you are fan of Anthony B, then Live on the Battlefield is a necessity for you. Fans of modern roots reggae as a whole might well be in the same boat, I love the idea of this album (which seems so simple, but is so rarely achieved) and it is carried out to near pefection. Truly excellent piece from one of modern roots reggae's greatest sons.

Chances are pretty high that if you have just recently picked up listening to reggae and specifically dancehall music within the last year or so, you probably don't have a good overstanding of what dancehall REALLY is. Although the genre could DEFINITELY be described as quite trendy as has been historically, the current trend: One in which every single top notch artist at one time or another seems bent on outdoing the other in making the MOST ridiculously violent record that they can; is one which given many a new fan the wrong idea altogether. Dancehall music, at its core, is one which is first and foremost meant for having fun. Its meant for going to your local dance, taking your woman (or meeting one there) and just enjoying yourself in the vibes. Yet, I would imagine it quite difficult trying to find such a vibes when sifting through the gun toting Mavados, Vybz Kartels, Bounty Killers and Aidonias of the world (even coming from the Ninjamans and Mad Cobras of the world, this current group has taken it beyond that DEFINITELY). All hope, thankfully, is not lost as there are a few artists keeping the FUN intensities nice and high and should you require such a jolt from what is, in my opinion (probably outside of soca these days for me) the most fun musical genre that there is. The main one is the one who has seemingly ALWAYS been there, dancehall ACE, Beenie Man. Its interesting that the main thing which (at least in my opinion) has separated Beenie Man from his (OVER) constant sparring partner, Bounty Killer, has been his ability to not only focus on throwing verbal jabs at the Killer, but ALSO throwing vibes in so many different forms of the dancehall. You will RARELY, if ever, reach a state in dancehall with Beenie Man as an active participant where he doesn't have a big tune running the dancehalls at that current moment, his catalogue is literally overflowing with such tunes which exist simply for `entertainment purposes'. There's also current dancehall poster boy, Sean Paul who also seems to just GET IT at his best moments. Sean Paul, although taking quite a bit of criticisms (and even some of them justified, although very few) over the years has all but ignored dragging himself into the gun business and making tunes which the keep rocking the ENTIRE WORLD. Definitely credit due there, whether you like it or not. Lastly, of course, is Elephant Man. Ele is a bit different as he seems to almost go overboard at times, but does so INTENTIONALLY. His tunes comes basically as soca music lifted and transposed into a dancehall vibes and, at its best, has the same foot hurting and ankle breaking effect. Those artists and a few others here and there (like Macka Diamond, Lady Saw and the recently retired Mr. Vegas) all are able to add frills and different scopes to their music, but never really lose focus on the FUN aspect of dancehall music.For my own personal tastes, THE artist who MOST seems to overstand that and convey it through their vibes has ALWAYS been General Degree. There's a very good chance that you may not even know who he is if you are a casual fan of dancehall and reggae as he has definitely been one for the hardcore dancehall heads throughout his career, and, despite his VERY accessible style of music, he hasn't had the opportunities for crossing over into the mainstream as many of his peers (mainly, in my opinion, due to the fact that his activity level was quite low in a few of those years). But ask anyone who knows (including yours truly) and they will tell you about the WICKED level of consistency displayed by the veteran Mandeville native over the course of SPACIOUS career. Not only will you have quite a difficult time finding pieces of his career where he dabbled in the more violent or war side of the vibes (and I can't think of any off hand), although his music is sometimes for the mature ears, you'll hardly ever find either, a situation where he recorded a tune which crossed the line into a slack nature like so many of his peers (can you imagine if you told someone like Vybz Kartel that he couldn't do anymore tunes about the gun or sex? He would have to retire on the spot). He is just an underrated CLEVER lyricist to be able to do something like such and you probably wouldn't hear the name Degree come into a conversation about dancehall's greatest lyricists, he just may be amongst that crowd. Also, to my opinion, Degree, like a few others such as Beenie Man, King Yellow Man, Spragga Benz at his peak and Super Cat at his peak as well, just seems to personify what the dancehall lifestyle really is. If `dancehall' was just some guy somewhere, he'd probably be Beenie Man, if he wasn't, then he'd definitely be General Degree, that simple. In the late 1990's Degree (who seems to constantly change between using and not using the `General' of his name) was in the process of further solidifying and then maintaining his name after coming to prominence on the strength of early hits such as Pianist, Brinks and of course the now LEGENDARY Granny and he was releasing albums consistently as well, such as this hard to find underrated GEM from VP, Degree. This album was just almost criminally overlooked as it well came within the timeframe during which Degree would have been at his most potent (in 1997, which means after the P `n' S album in 1994, but before the Bush Baby album in 1998, both of which were very popular pieces from the artist). Probably the reason for that is the nature of the Degree album in itself. As opposed to Bush Baby and P `n' S (and later, the STUFFED Yeah Man album) it has (as the cover might suggest) a much more SLEEK and laid back vibes throughout. I'm not saying that the album gets rootsy or anything like that, but it seems as if Degree had taken a mind to make an album which was fun for the dance floor specifically instead of doing something exclusively for the comedic stance which he did from the Granny days or something which was HYPE for the dance floor, which is what became of the Bush Baby and Yeah Man albums. For me, I'm a dancehall head, I love it either way and the Degree album from the General is a very fun trip back in time to a dancehall with a great deal more of a sense of humour and a (positive) flash.Degree originally came to prominence within the Main Street camp of producer Danny Browne. He, like many of his label mates at the time (like Red Rat, Mr. Vegas, Goofy and Buccaneer) came up with the more FUN type of dancehall vibes, thus a big credit goes to Browne there and for producing a bit of the Degree album as well. Getting things started on said album is probably one of the most unusual tunes on the album as well as one of the most popular, Spark Plug. Consider your very first trip through the tune as little more than a 'throwaway' as you probably won't realize how much you like the tune on the first spin. Spark Plug has an almost sappy feel to it (the melody sounding like something someone came up with and ran into the studio with it far too quickly). But, should/when you get through that, Spark Plug is downright BRILLIANT and ADDICTIVE. That same melody which had your face screwing will quickly turn into a full on head rocking type of vibes. Definitely a nice way to open things and one of the album's finest. Next up things slow down just a bit with What A Ting. Again, this is a tune which requires more than one spin through (although what you'll get out of this one won't be as strong as Spark Plug), but what lies beneath is a solid girls tune, definitely not Degree's finest or even the album's for that matter, but just an average and serviceable track. Completing the opening of the Degree album is Hold Me which is a similarly vibed tune to its immediate predecessor What A Ting, but a definite step up of sorts. This tune, still, isn't exactly one of the album's finest (it picks up after the opening, trust me) and I question placing it directly after a tune which sounds a lot like it, but it is just a nice and cool vibes for the album and I can't really complain there. Altogether a pretty pedestrian start for a General Degree album after the opener, but things are looking up.To my ears, they don't look up higher than what proves to be the album's finest track all in all, the WICKEDLY ADDICTIVE Woh Woh. The vibes on the album change IMMEDIATELY after the slower two tracks which send out the opening and they reach critical mass on Woh Woh as I can't imagine a more successful way to change the goings than with the nerve-catching Living Dangerously riddim from Jah Screw. Outside of the title track for the riddim (from Barrington Levy & Bounty Killer) Degree definitely scored with the biggest tune on the piece and it scores as this album's biggest as well. BIG BIG TUNE. Woh Woh is definitely aided by the tunes which surround it as it comes in a line of four VERY strong tracks. That string begins with what is definitely another of the real highlights of the album and the first of three official combinations, Touch You Again alongside former dancehall diva (turned gospel singer) Chevelle Franklyn. The two make a very nice duo (Franklyn did that with just about everyone) and she is actually another of the artists who spent a bit of time through Main Street if I recall correctly, the vibes are well high and just creative and fun, everything you would expect from such a pairing. Love the vibes on that one. Following Woh Woh is the tune Burn which has just a bit harder type of vibes but is BLESSED with a nice baseline throughout which just keeps the attentions and keeps the bodies swaying definitely. And that aforementioned line of nice tunes ends (although Carbon Copy is good as well) with the BIG Limited Edition which may be the single most popular tune from this album as it was featured as a single (had a video and all) back then. Coming through on Steely & Clevie's hip-hop inspired but THUMPING Copycat riddim (which had a few different mixes, also check Bushman's No Sunshine for a next nice one), the tune tells the ladies out there not to be too late in realizing when they come across a good one as they are indeed of limited edition. The other two of the aforementioned three tunes feature Degree alongside Lady Saw and Hawkeye on Who Badda and Crosses, respectively. The wicked Richie Stephens produced Who Badda is the stronger of the two full on as it comes on the strength of the BIG vibed Girls Galore riddim AND, besides that, it would have come at a time when Saw was just ruling with similarly vibed combinations with her male counterparts such as Merciless, Spragga Benz, Red Rat and, of course, Beenie Man. They were all very good in my opinion and Who Badda is definitely no different (consider yourself DEEP if you, like me, are currently singing Woman Sneaking in your head!). And for his part, Hawkeye does a nice job as well with the strong Crosses. Hawkeye may very well be my LEAST favourite modern dancehall DJ period (if not him then Bling Dawg, Chino or Alozade take the crown), but I have to give credit where its due and it's well due on the KNOCKING Crosses which introduces just a TOUCH of conscious elements to the album, but still, as is his style, one for the dance floor at the same time. I HAVE TO go back and mention the BRILLIANCE that is Woman Rule. The tune speaks of all the guys who big talk about a woman not being the boss of them (they are the boss of us all). It kind of reminds me (or the other way around) of young Erup's HUGE tune Gal A Run Dem Head, but probably even more clever. As Degree unforgettably says if it isn't a woman ruling that guy, then it might just be `someone' else. Cleverly cleverly done over the long forgotten but still BIG Farakhan riddim. Have to mention Cartoon, just because. The riddim their (Main Street's Rich riddim) is one of the best on the Degree album and it's VINTAGE Main Street vibes; just something established for no other reason than to give the artist something to have a good time over it and to my recollection, there went many, if any at all better times to be had on the Rich riddim that Degree's Cartoon (Character). And, as if we needed it (and we didn't), is even more indication of Degree's brilliance as he ends his self titled album with one of the most popular efforts here, Robin Hood. I'm sure you can imagine what the tune is and only matching the creativity of Degree's lyrical approach is the riddim, Vertical's Rock Robin) which sounds like something out of a. . . 1950's detective television show. It would take a genuine dancehall MASTER to score on that one and Degree shows his class and does just that, sending the album out on one its highest notes altogether.Overall, I always point to Degree as somewhat of a dancehall `litmus test'. Meaning that he makes the type of dancehall music which is SO easily accessible by fans of other genres like hip-hop, r&b; and pop, so if you can't find SOMETHING here that you like then you REALLY don't like dancehall music at all (and I send you my condolences). So definitely I'm recommending the Degree album from General Degree to new fans of dancehall (even now, almost twelve years later still). AND, if you are a dancehall head then you should already be on this one and know it, given that it contains several of his better known tracks. Degree isn't Degree's best album to date and like I said, its one that seems to consistently float beneath the radar amongst most, but should you really find it up and dig into it, what you'll find is the same thing I found. One of the most underrated and unfortunately forgotten albums in modern dancehall history, period.

Despite the massive amount of accolade VPRecords has been receiving for their dancehall recently for Sean Paul and Wayne Wonder's successes, respectively, they have continued to keep their crown in the roots arena. Albums like last year's mega hit Da Real Thing by Sizzla, and this year's gem Ghetto Life by Jah Cure have helped VP begin to create a significant interest in roots music in the US and Street Knowledge by Anthony B, can do nothing but help the wave.Street Knowledge is a seriously good album. Often underrated, Anthony B's penmanship is off the scales on some of the lyrics on this album, and the overall, kind of laid backness of the record helps it significantly, along with some well-placed combos and covers. Anthony B's cover songs prove to be two of the best tunes on this one, Two Sevens Clash which features its originator Culture is a flat out amazing redo for an all time classic as is Pass the Kutchie with the Mighty Diamonds. That being said, my favourite tune on this album is last year's hit Good Cop, from the first second that I first heard it, it just stuck with me, and i still love it. Also love the kind of harder edged Police, and the opener God Above Everything Else. And Ghettoman Do That as well, and surprisingly Dancing Mood. There was a tune on his last album, That's Life called Fire Dance, that i didn't like, Dancing Mood which continues in the much the same fashion, however, has grown on me. Also interestingly on the album is the Wyclef Jean penned Gun Powder, and i have to give Wyclef credit because the lyrics on that one are very very good. The album ends in a tune called Stop Di War in the Music. The tune is pretty much a medley of artist after artist talking about the hatred and warring in reggae music. Recognizable voices are Sizzla, Frisco Kid, Wayne Marshall and Ninjaman.Overall, I'd certainly strongly recommend Street Knowledge for sure. Fans of the artist, for you, this one is certainly a must. Its time artists like Anthony B, Sizzla, Buju Banton and Capleton show the US massive what the other half of reggae music is really about.

Call it shrewd business dealings by reggae giant label Greensleeves to virtually lock down the solo career to date of dancehall elite, `The Energy God' and Vybz Kartel or even take it a step further by calling it downright record label brilliance. The result is that should you pick up ANY of Elephant Man's four solo albums to date and run through the liner notes, you'll notice the phrase `Greensleeves Publishing' on each and every track. The label which is often criticized (although, albeit to a much lesser degree these days) for their mistreatment of artists who constantly seek to leave their tables, legally, deserve much respect for scoring some of the biggest feats in reggae publishing history! Besides owning publishing rights for such artists as Elephant Man and Kartel, they also own rights for every artist they have under contract (even the `mystery duo' Kid Kurrupt and Predator) as well as several big name producers such as Vendetta and Lenky (yes! They own publishing for the MASSIVE Diwali riddim which you know oh so very well).The result of their grand achievement is that during 2007, their 30 year Anniversary (congrads GS, while I may criticize you, you have GREATLY improved) they get to have some fun and open the vault of their releases of three ridiculously jam packed Elephant Man albums, the first three of his career (the smallest of which, Log On, checks in at a whopping 22 tracks long!), and release his first `official' greatest hits album. And while no tracks appear from his most recent album and major debut, Good 2 Go, yes, Greensleeves owns right to those twenty tracks as well.Elephant Man has probably been the signature artist of the most recent history of the label, having released three humongous and crazy selling albums for the label each year from 2000 through 2002. The albums, of course did well for Greensleeves, but also did a great job in exposing one of Jamaica's. . . most interesting talents to the international world. Starting with 2000's Comin' 4 You which saw young Ele, fresh removed from the Scare Dem Crew (and Scare Dem controversies) which was as about as straight hardcore dancehall do you will ever get out of Elephant Man; on to `01's big big Log On which BOOMED largely due to the high powered title track which you might STILL hear playing in dances all over the world; ending with 2002's INSANITY which was Higher Level at a point at which Ele had already become one of the dancehall's biggest draws and most controversial figures. These albums helped launch Elephant Man into his senior album, Good 2 Go his debut (and last album) for the mighty VP/Atlantic deal as well as launch him into his current situation, poised to become Badboy's first dancehall release later this year.Old fans will remember these songs almost to a fault, they could even better call it `The Underground Years' or the `Metamorphosis'. Listening to some of these songs you see how 'Seaview Gardens Ghetto Yute' transformed into 'Dancehall Madman' in a very short period of time. Coming from the rough and tough (but still quite insane) Scare Dem Crew and changing into the the Scare Dem solo! Elephant has made himself more than SIGNIFICANT while adding virtually no seriousness to his vibes, and having more than his fair share of fun the entire time.The first installment of Monsters of Dancehall gets started out on a wonderful and expected note. Dropping in on Jeremy Harding's marvelous Liquid riddim is the biggest hit of Ele's career to date, Log On. I've never been much of a fan for LISTENING to dance instruction tunes (its much more of a visual artform if you ask me) but standing alone as a song you have to confess, Log On is superior! Its just wonderful to listen to, more fun if you're dancing, but even just listening, Log On produces one massive vibes! Chasing Log On is one of my favorite Ele tunes the addictive Elephant Message over the highly-addictive Diwali riddim (to which Greensleeves owns publishing to) from Lenky. Lenky's album for the Diwali (which I still listen to) told you everything you needed to know about Elephant Message. Part of the reason why its so good is because its master made it so unique from its brothers and sisters and Ele's diwali is among the most fun in existence.Not to make it seem all good, there is some not so good (i.e. bad) material here. Such is the case for On-line, the Log On's il-fated younger brother which flows on a dial-up modem and STILL hasn't gotten us to the internet. Also failing to hit the highpoints is The Robbing, Ele's answer to Lady Spice's tune about himself being victim of a robbery in their brief (and friendly) 'war'. Also not too fond of Xmas Dancehall Tall Up- Tall Up and its VERY annoying style! And Genie Dance is annoying and you know it!All that being said, I crack a wry smile each and everytime I spin any of those tunes, even Ele's worse has some sort of redeeming quality to it.Back to the good. One of my favorite Ele tunes appears later on in Monsters of Dancehall, No Hail Me over Vendetta's strong Mad Ants riddim (to which Greensleeves owns the publishing). Always loved No Hail Me from inception, and still it stands out to this day; Theonly real combination on the album, Bad Gal, Bad Man with Ce'cile over she and Scatta's fierce Double Jeopardy riddim (to which Greensleeves owns the publishing), always hearing a woman's voice on such an album is a nice changeup (especially one as fine as Ce'cile). Give Her it Good, dancehall disco, over Lenky's Masterpiece riddim (to which Greensleeves owns the publishing) which is addictive to an almost sickening degree!I also LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVE Jamaica, a darker vibes from the Log On album, which was one of the better tune son that album, as it is on this one as well. Things lighten up on the hilarious Truth Hurts over the Orgasm riddim which is the basic fun diss tune to many of his peers. Lastly, check the truly wicked Replacement Killer from Shocking Vibes! Replacement Killer was the big tune from the Comin' 4 You album and should you stay away from it for awhile and jut recently here it here, it works just like the first time you heard it. Big tune!Overall, I say all this assuming the essential problem with the Energy God: Monsters of Dancehall album is basically known: With not even a decade passing since all of these tunes were voiced and popular, its ENTIRELY too soon to be dropping them in Greatest HIts fashion. Therefore, I can ONLY recommend the album to newer fans. If you happen to miss two or ALL of Elephant Man's albums prior to Good 2 Go (which if you've read this far through the review is fairly unlikely) then this is the album for you. Fans who have been picking up on everything, don't listen to your friend when they say 'There's a new Ele out!', at least not until the summer, because you already have this.

The mixtape and proven effective method of putting new music and new artists out there to the masses, and of all musical forms hip-hop has probably gained the most usage of the mixtape, as even the upper echelon of rap acts routinely do work exclusively for the mixtape circuits and even go as far as doing it for their own promotions.Reggae, however, is quite different. Generally in reggae the mixtape is done by a completely independant party and done for his/her own benefit not necessarily for the promotion of the music or the artists behind it.So give massive biggups to the Lustre Kings crew as well as Project Groundation for releasing this hard to find gem of a mixtape featuring some of the biggest and most well known roots reggae acts as well as some of the up and coming names. And they've done it professionally (case and point, you're currently reading this on Amazon.com aren't you?), legitamately and for the promotion of the music and the artists, as they have already released 2 albums from artists on this album (Turbulence & Lutan Fyah) and worked extensively with many of the others.The album runs in pretty much typical mixtape fashion with a few turns. It is of course a continuous mix, spanned over the course of 7 riddims (the Fortune Teller, Alarm Clock, Liberation, African Charm, Talking Drum, Disco Rock and the Shining, as well as remix section). There are 61 tracks in all with every one being a verse from a specific tune and in many cases other verses are given (thus you get a track called Keep the Pace and then get Keep the Pace pt. II) later in the riddim.Picking the best verse out of the 61 would probably be impossible. Instead I'll tell you that the best riddim here is without a doubt the biggest that LKP has ever done, the massive Alarm Clock riddim. The piece is just so beautiful and absolutely had it been a native JA riddim, it would have done even more major damage than it did and continues to do, the Alarm Clock is massive and represented by 9 beautiful cuts, perhaps the best being Natty King's See the Wicked Run.Other standouts on this massive project include Norris Man and Lutan Fyah doing big things on the opener Fortune Teller riddim with Thunderous Sound and No More War, respectively. Lutan coming back in grand fashion on the hit from his recent album, Stress Free, on the Liberation riddim. Fyah again on Fyah in the Barn as well as Jah Mason on Free Up on the Shining riddim. And of course Turbulence on We Need Liberation on the Liberation riddim, which might be the single best complete tune from this project.Of course, this is what it is, its a big Rasta (Bobo centered) mix tape, so the usual suspects are present as well. Sizzla, Capleton & Luciano all make appearances on the sound as well.Overall, if you are at all a fan of roots reggae, I'd go as far as to say that this one is a definite for you, however, for the newer fan this one might be just as crucial. The easy-listening style of the project makes it very accessible to those who are just treading the water of the genre (trust me, I know how many times I've leant this thing out over the near year since I bought it). Its a fantastic album and one I hope to see continue in the coming years. Do we see Vol 2???

It was a pretty long wait for Spanish Town's finest dj to finally touch down on an album. Fyah had been making a big name for himself for a few years, through, amongst other avenues, working with the fine Lustrekings Productions crew, and the height of that working has spawned one of the single best reggae debuts that you will EVER hear.Fyah's style isn't anything you haven't heard before if you are a fan of roots reggae. He follows right along in the tried and tested methods of artist's like Sizzla Kalonji, Junior Kelly, Turbulence, Jah Mason etc. (although he's pretty much a pure dj), but the artist has undoubtedly distinguished himself through an abundance of vibes.It was on a LKP project that I first heard him, their massive first release, the Culture Dem Vol. 1 album on which he did arguably the best tune on the disc, No More War, which is present on Time & Place and is amongst the very best here.My choice for the absolute best track, however, is probably the massive Upliftment combination with Jah Dan. I will tell you that T&P; is absolutely devoid of bad tracks, however, standouts include the opener combination with Yami Bolo, Fire in the Barn, the beautiful Speak Softly, Rise and Shine riding the single best riddim from LKP altogether, that riddim is huge! Also really love Ithio First which features bits of a speech by Marcus Mosiah Garvey himself; Streets of the Ghetto, Joy Within Myself. . .I can pretty much recommend each and every tune on this album without exception, the album is HUGE! Absolutely put Lutan Fyah in with the emerging class of big young roots reggae artists. Such artists as Natty King, I Wayne (both also seeing their debuts in 2005), Turbulence, Warrior King, Jah Cure etc. are all artists who are stepping up to feel the Rasta chants, and to under no stipulations: Lutan Fyah is in that class of artist. Armed with this album (and a European album released just before this one which is also very very good) several big tunes in JA (including the as of this writing current big tune, Rasta Still Deh Bout with Josie Mel and Peace in Spanish Town) the future is blinding bright for one of the humblest and little known talents in Jamaica, big big things are in store.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

Going on 2 years now! I've been waiting on an album release from Marlon Asher. From the first time I heard the big big song Ganja Farmer, I wanted to hear a full length studio album from Asher, and was definite sure that he wouldn't fade away and become a one hit wonder. That wasn't the case at all, as subsequently, the Trini native has proven to have some serious vibes and even having his first album at 31, he definitely has a long and healthy career ahead of him.I got what I thought was just a sampler of this album having only 8 tracks altogether on the disc. But this is in fact hyped as Asher's 'Preview Album' for Caribbean Underground, the label who originally put out the first international pressing of Ganja Farmer. And with just 8 tracks, the first 3 of which all flow along the same Ganja Farmer riddim, it exists solely to give you a taste of whats to come, when hopefully he signs a nice deal with VP or Greensleeves and comes strong with the 15 track release.Until then we have locked out! One of the very interesting song on the album is the combination with NYC dj Kapa Shanti, just the combination of styles and I hadnt ever even heard of Shanti before, the combo works however. As I mentioned, the first 3 tracks are on the same riddim. The latter 2 I Believe and I Love Yuh are both pretty decent songs, I Love You actually sounds like somewhat of a freestyle but it still works for me.Of course it goes without saying that he best tune on Locked Out is definitely Ganja Farmer. The song has lost none of its luster for me, despite the fact that I routinely still listen to it at least once a day, just a wonderful song about the treatment of herb in Trinidad, built over one of the easiest and most laid back riddims and vibes that you'll ever here. Ganja Farmer works on the 'less is more' theory taking minimalist (yet wonderful) production a very very long way. And probably in a few years, we'll look back on Ganja Farmer and say it was somewhat pioneering in the reggae scene in Trinidad.But that's not all! The 3 other tunes are all winners as well. Standing, the only other song here that I was actually familiar with, as it was a previous release, with the nice refrain announcing "This is Mr Marlon Asher!". Standing is a knowledge track, on a typically Asher-like level vibe. The title track is also very impressive as well. Locked Out is more of the same strong roots: "I just wanna be a child of Jah! Give thanx and praise forevah! I dont wanna be swimming in a lake of fyah. . . I dont wanna be locked out of Zion!". Making the very simple cover even more powerful as you literally see him separated from the Conquering Lion.Love of Jah is the first 'official' single from the album, I assume, as its the only title here with a video supporting it very strong track as well. BUT! My second favourite track here is the aptly titled Wonderful, which is a. . . wonderful track! Wonderful is about as upbeat a track Asher has ever done that I've heard, but after awhile it just gets magical and he sticks to that bouncy riddim without bobbling at all, that track was made for this tune! Wonderful could be a big hit in JA, given the proper chance and promotion.Interesting to mention that I always likened Asher's style to some of the up and coming dj talent here, however the artist that I'd say he most vocally resembles is without a doubt Jah Cure. No, he doesnt have that earth shattering vibe in his voice that you'll find Cure applying, but he has that somewhat raspy earthly creek to his voice which he uses to perfection (you can hear it especially in the title track, the first few lines of which sound like something directly from Jah Cure).Overall, its likely that unless you go the ordering route that you wont be able to find much from Locked Out. As it is a preview album but also from an indie internation and young label, all signs make this one an order! But should you have the opportunity to get it definitely take it, Marlon Asher is one of many young talents to keep an eye on!P.S. Loving what they are doing in TnT on the roots scene. Before, it seemed as if it was the Empress, Queen Omega trodding alone on the scene, but with talent like Asher, Propher Benjamin and the lethally wicked Khari Kill emerging, TnT looks to join St Croix as a haven for reggae outside of JA.

There have perhaps been more talented and more versatile dj's than Bounty Killer. There have been tons of lesser talents who have garnered more attention, both at home and abroad. There have been artist's who have even made their name off of Bounty Killer's career, and although he is the crowned Warlord, he has not won EVERY single battle, although he has won every war.However, when it comes to literally OWNING the ear of the ghettos of Jamaica, no other artist has ruled those areas, particularly in Kingston with an iron fist as Bounty Killer has. Every single artist you will ever hear of from these areas will claim, above all others as his (and sometimes her) greatest source of inspiration. Artists such as Vybz Kartel, Aidonia, Busy Signal and even Warrior King will list the Killer as the best and claim to know all of his lyrics (even though most of them aren't from Kingston). Bounty has also done his part to seeing that the talent get risen to such a level to be mentioned in the same sentence as himself, as he has in recent years been the courier to bringing up such now established talents as Elephant Man, Vybz Kartel, Wayne Marshall, Baby Cham and a slew of others.Therefore, its only fitting, after having released double greatest hits album for Beenie Man, Sizzla and Beres Hammond, and a well powerful single for Lady Saw as well, that the Warlord would get his turn as well.This is the begin all, end all albums for Killer. This album is so well put together that just listening to it had me reliving my teenage years and hearing songs that I used to recite at lunch time daily. Songs like the long forgotten but smash No Interview, New Gun, Gun Thirsty, the big man combination 21 with Pinchers!But that's just the beginning. More recent hits such as Sufferah with Wayne Marshall from the Diwali riddim and the dark and slack Fitness with Angel Doolas also made the cut, so if you just started listening to Rodney Price in the last few years you're covered as well, but I suspect that the fan who will get the most satisfaction out of this one is the fan who has been following his entire life. Its just awfully interesting to see how Killa's style changed with the times but never sold out to what was popular, just a natural and gradual change. Evolving now to the point of him becomming the proto-type modern aged aggressive styled dancehall dj.My favorite Bounty Killer song of all time is track #7, disc one LODGE. Its my favorite song between the 2 discs, just that simple simple beating of the lyrics and arrangement just keeps the head nodding. Also love the songs proceeding it: of course Spy fi Die, of course Coppershot, of course Statement, of course Dead This Time! They also pack the quality at the end of the first disc with hit after hit, My Xperience, the fine fine Suspence which I hardly remembered, Fedup Sufferah and the disc ends with the notorious Look. One of the hardest pure dancehall culture songs you'll ever hear anywhere.Disc 2 is packed just as tight, although perhaps in a 'lighter' mood. All the 'gal tunes' seem to congregate on disc 2. Although, the oddball such as the sickly wicked Warlord makes an apperance on disc 2. The best of the gal tunes is probably the big hit combination with singer Barrington Levy, Living Dangerously, still one of my favorite songs with the rather most unlikely of combinations running through. He also drops in the odd but classic ode to his mother on Miss Ivy Last Son which became a hit on all reggae fronts. Salvation, Seek God, Roots Reality & Culture all culturally follow such big tunes as Fitness and Arrow in closing out the spectacular disc 2 before a rare Addies special/mix.ALSO, big biggups to VP. The album is very very nicely packaged and presented and they have been on a roll lately with not only regular releases but greatest hits albums and re-releases from such artists is I-Kong, Dennis Brown (biggup Locks Lion on the review) and Garnett Silk. And although Killa may have not proven to be the best business man, but he has scored maybe the finest deal of his career as next year will see the release of not only his first album since 2002 but an album featuring his 'Alliance' crew which features some of the best talent Jamaica has to offer (Kartel, Ele, Busy Signal, Idonia, Wayne Marshall, Mavado etc.) as well.Overall, I can't recommend this one enough for a wide variety of Bounty Killer fans. This is a project for all of his fans. For the new fan, this will show you the history of the artist which you're just getting to know and show you exactly where he came from and how he got to be where he is in terms of his standing in dancehall. And of course, old fans will literally drool over Nah No Mercy's lineup, trust that your favorite song is here! From the classic style that Bounty revolutionized of dj battles and war and all the wins and scars he's collected over the years to the oft-forgotten versatility of the artist. Definitely 5 stars, definitely one of the best albums of the year, and definitely looking forward to a huge '07 from the Killa.

Hey this is a very good dancehall cd. I would have given it a higher rating but as his name would indicate, sometimes, Goofy plays too much. With their being a song called Somebody Just Poop, which sounds exactly how you would imagine it might, you just know how goofy he can get. There is also a song called Brush Yuh Teeth, which also sounds just like you might imagine. The high points on this one are Coom Coom and Advice both featuring Red Rat. The highest point on the album is Dark Glass with Beenie Man, just the Chinese sound in the rhythm is pretty addictive. Also Bad Man Fearless and Let It Off, Spot Light is not bad as well. Goofy's voice goes everywhere on this album, I got his album because I heard a song and I thought it was Baby Cham deejaying but it was Goofy, and you listen to it and he goes from Baby Cham's voice range, all the way up to Lexxus'. So if you're absolutely desperate for some dancehall, which I was and still am, I would suggest you definitely give Goofy a try, because you could definitely do much much worse. This is a very high quality album. Warning: Bad Man Lyrics Pon These Tunes.

I kind of wondered what was taking so long for Greensleeves to get into the Mix Tape arena. It always seemed like the type of thing that they would do and with this strange year that 2003 has been for them, I suppose it became the perfect time. In this year where their main competitor (VP)has blown up the world-over, they have released only albums by 3 artists (Vybz Kartel, Sizzla and Ward 21) and tons of version or Riddim Series albums, this album, along with yet another version album wraps up the year.First thing I have to say, if you normally listen to reggae and if you are a big reggae fan, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. There is nothing hear that you haven't heard already, and if you, like me, tend to favor greensleeves non riddim series compilations over VP's, then you might also have all of these on cd or LP already. There are no new tunes here, there are no exclusives, just specials cut by among others, Bounty Killer, and Elephant Man. The songs 90% of the time have the first verse cut out for the mix and absolutely no song here appears off the riddim on which it was initially cut. Very easily done. The best thing about this album is that with 66 tracks strong, it will lend itelf to party's or very very long driving situations very easily. All the year's deep dancehall hits are pretty much here (Sweet to the Belly, Nuh No Head, Why You Doing It etc.)Overall, i dont suppose this is too bad of an effort for an initial release in a series, it usually takes Greensleeves awhile to catch on and they usually do in a big way when they do. Next year, more exclusive material and probably even a different producer (this time around is Bobby Konders) (there's a certain German soundman who would probably do this very well), which is expected. Get it if you're really falling for this new wave Sean Paul, Elephant and Wayne Wonder dancehall thing. If you're a dancehall head, you really cant do much with this.

Lady Saw's best of album is a classic if you are at all into dancehall, even a little. Everything you could ask for as a Lady Saw fan. Sycamore Tree, If Him Lef, Strange Feeling, Healing, No Long Talking, Stab Out the Meat and almost every other song on the album. You need this cd if you love dancehall, you absolutely need it.

2005 was a huge year for the young Sheldon Campbell (bka Turbulence). In a year where he finally delivered the massive hit both fans and critics alike were saying was a necessity before he could truly step into the upper echelon of roots reggae artists, with the song, Notorious. And #1's didn't stop for the artist either as combinations with then-girlfriend Sasha also climbed the local and international charts as well. Combine this with Turbulence being almost unanimously voted artist of the year for `05 as well as stepping out of the shadow of mentor, Sizzla Kalonji to begin headlining his own shows, and Turbulence had a remarkable year (album-wise as well, doing a couple of fine pieces that year).2006, on the other hand, was a different story. While still maintaining a high profile, and exercising a strong deal of quality control on most of his recordings, 2006 was mired in controversies and an unfulfilled capitalization on the strength of the previous year for the artist. He spent as much time in the tabloids as he did on the charts with the rather public breakup with now ex-girlfriend, Sasha, which even extended to the studio as both fired (VERY) personal shots at each other over the bubbling Sika riddim (and Sasha landed the better shots). Also, things wined down musically as well, with the long awaited Notorious album finally touching the streets and receiving rather mediocre reviews, this coming after March's solid Nah Sell Out release and prior to August's even worse X Girlfriend (which is probably his worse album to date, but still actually quite decent).The solution? Seeking to kick off the new year in solid fashion, Turbulence turns back the clock and reunites with German roots producer, Brotherman. The pair formerly hooked up on 2003's well solid (and quite successful) Different Thing album, which is still, to date, one of Turbulence's (and Brotherman's for that matter) most powerful releases. So it was no surprise that the first artist to get a second chance on the young but strong Minor 5 Flat 7 label, and although not as strong as Different Thing overall, Do Good is a more than a welcome addition to Turbulence's catalogue (Do Good, by my count, becomes Turbulence's 15th album to date, in a little less than 7 years of making albums, still a looooooooong way to go to catch his mentor hahaha!).Several of Turbulence's more recent releases had began to have a mechanical feel to them. This includes the X Girlfriend album and even back to 2005's Triumphantly and especially the Songs of Solomon album, and while Do Good does at times suffer from the stock and trade feel (some of that is due to Brotherman of course), it rises above falling into that category with its timing. Obviously Turbulence either focused more in recording it or (and more likely) Do Good was recorded during the same sessions which produced the wicked wicked Different Thing album.The best tune here is probably the big lovely Nambo horn backed Pursue. The song, lyrically, is something you've heard a thousand times (but it actually sticks out on Do Good with not much of these type of songs present here), but over the lovely one drop combined with Turbulence's seemingly trying to keep a calmer vibes, make Pursue a well powerful meditation! It almost sounds like a big band track meets roots reggae and a very interesting style of song building from Brotherman and co.Thinking of nice one-drops, another tune definitely worth spinning several times is the beautiful (and obligatory) Mama tune, fittingly titled, Mothers. I also really enjoyed the well powerful We Deserve which is just a hair harsher than what you've come to expect from Brotherman's production, but is probably the strongest `hard' reggae song he has ever produced. All the while, Turbulence, again limits himself and the vibes flow better than if he were to just COMPLETELY lose his calm in an effort to make a harder record. I would have loved to hear Jumbo Ras, Prince Javed and co. joining Turbulence on Move On on any other riddim besides the downright odd Classic as well, but Give Thanks more than makes up for it over the nice Grow riddim.A problem that occurs with Do Good, however is through the riddims. If you, like myself, have been keeping up with M5F7 releases then there's an EXCELLENT chance that you've heard many of these riddims already. And while you've yet to hear Turbulence over them, songs like the wicked wicked title track almost seem to lose some power, due to the fact that I've been playing the Friedenland riddim which backs it for nearly 2 years straight now (Josie Mel has a big big record, Consecrate Yourself, on the Friedenland). It almost seems as if they waited a little too long to release, as some of these riddims have already established a signature tune in my head, such as the Campo, which backs Lutan Fyah's nice Clearance and is tapped here for Turbulence on Facts. Also included is Freedom Train with Luciano, which also appears on his M5F7 release, 2003's Tell it From the Heart; and a throwaway is basically what the final track amounts to, just a remix that really should never have happened.Overall, Do Good is an album strictly for fans. Newer fans just getting accustomed to the artist, this one definitely isn't for you (what you're looking for is the ultra hard to find Rising or Join Us albums). It is typically Brotherman's style to go heavy on the roots and although WELL appreciated by us who support the genre, `outsiders' probably wouldn't feel Do Good too nicely (although, if you happen to be a fan who missed Josie Mel`s Rasta Still Deh Bout, Taffari`s Addicted to Music, Lutan Fyah`s Dem No Know Demself, Anthony B's My Hope and Al Pancho's Righteous Men albums (shame on you!) then you might appreciate Do Good even that much more. Do Good probably ranks right in the middle of Turbulence's albums in terms of quality (thinking about albums like The Truth, I Believe and Upright), but still that's better than most's top flight material, despite the controversy, Turbulence is still top notch.

The Trafalga, produced by Peter Jackson 'The Rattler', suffers from being an excellent riddim with nearly pure average dancehall djs taking their cracks at it. It has a very very heavy sound to it (which is Jackson's style, see his other album for the Diesel) and seemingly only the most talented artists can have their way with this one, thus without even hearing this album, you can probably guess which tunes are the best based solely on the artist.What do I like? I like the opener, Bounty by said Bounty Killer and Angel Doolas, Mi Food by Mad Cobra, Workable by Buju, My Crew by slept-on-entirely-too-long Roundhead shockingly Girls Galore by Alozade and Bad Mind by Determine. My absolute favorite tune, however, is Gunz Like Mine by Vybz Kartel, he puts the riddim through its paces and nearly flattens it. All that being said, Gwan Good by Danny English and Co., Girls Like We by Bling Dawg and Mr Phang, Dance Gal by Buccaneer, Gunz Wi Have by Galaxy P,Gal Feel Like by Vegas, Nuh Back And Front by Prophet, Di Anaconda by Elephant Man and Mack 11 by Kiprich are all somewhere between completely average and horrible, most falling closer to Horrible.Overall, the star of this show is Peter Jackson the producer who is doing a good job of keeping himself right on the outskirts of the truly great Dancehall producers. He has shown growth, where the Diesel was all completely the same riddim, the Trafalga makes slight variations over the duration of the album for each artist, which makes it more listenable to non-traditonal dancehall listeners. Get it if you're curious about what makes an average dancehall tune and what makes a good one, not more in recent memory can i remember a better example of such.

It might just be me, but I think that the world is a considerably better place anytime roots/dancehall reggae stalwart Everton Blender releases an album. The man seems as if he were made for NO other purpose than releasing consistently brilliant and consistently underappreciated gems of tunes to the delight of his fans all over the world.Its My Time marks Blender's first album since 2003's massive King Man which may have been his most complete work to date. It also marks the first time in awhile that he's ventured outside the comforts of Heartbeat Records to do his releases, opting for It's My Time to be released by the Canadian based outfit, Explorer Music. Most of the production for Its My Time was also done by Explorer in Canada and for the first time listening to their product I was more than impressed, due in large part, undoubtedly, to the Blender himself, but musically Explorer is on point.The best tune here may be the only cover, the One Who Loves You finds Blender doing a fine cover of a timeless Curtis Mayfield piece. If One Who Loves You isn't the best tune then the distinction falls squarely on the love cry filled She Is Leaving, DO NOT listen to that tune if you find yourself in such a situation TRUST ME, I know, very big tune nevertheless.Also check Shanty, Make it If You Try, The Philosopher (nice Rastaman chant) and the excellent closer which is the only combination on the album, Sing Mi A Go Sing with Louie Culture over a massive Bobby Digital riddim (same riddim serviced for Capleton's Jah Is My Everything. Also really really like the first single Travel the World.Overall, Explorer does a good job in bringing back such an outstanding talent in Everton Blender, definitely a major score for them in releasing Its My Time. Fortunately (for everyone) the little production which Explorer doesn't do is filled in quite nicely by such crucial minds as Digital and Mafia & Fluxy. Would not be surprised or disappointed at all to see this combination returned to at some point in the future, because after all, you put that lethal voice over lethal vibes and you'll never fail. No it isn't as good as King Man (if he releases another 100 albums and never approaches that level again the career will still be considered great), but Its My Time is a fine example of one of the better talents in all of reggae doing his thing.

Number 15 in this series is the first one that I bought, and its pretty good. This is the kind of album that usually takes a minute or two to grow on me, so I'll probably rewrite this review at some point. Not being a fan of Mr. Vegas' I think that two of his best cuts ever Duppy Durex and Some-Boy (which is probably his best after heads high) are present here. Also Bounty Killer has 3 songs on the record, the best of which is All Out. Capleton also has 3 with Help being the best and Hands Off on a different rhythm being a close second. I also like Elephant Man's Blaze It Up, never knew that he could flow like that, never being a big EM fan. Lexxus, Beenie Man, and Red Rat of course keep it hot as always, check out what happens when Red Rat gets serious on his lyrics. You also have two tracks by Ward 21 Thug Anthem is the best, Sizzla is here as well doing straight dancehall on Woman Dem a Fi We. Overall, this cd is a hot compilation, is not as good as Juice, for comp. of the year, but as far as compilations on different rhythms, its the best so far. Warning: Bad Man Lyrics Pon These Tunes

Bunny Wailer, the lesser known of the founding fathers of one the greatest bands ever (Bob Marley and the Wailers), is often underrated and overlooked solo artist. While he had not the vocals of Bob Marley, and arguably not the overall musical feel of the brilliant Peter Tosh, what he did have was a penchant for writing songs that were suspiciously powerful: Meaning that when you just casually listen to a Bunny Wailer record, you might not get the entire concept, but when you hang on his every word, you see his brilliance.On Blackheart Man, one of the greatest albums ever written, his lyrical prowess is at its absolute peak. The best tune on the album is the title track, on which Bunny recalls his days as a yute and his mother telling him to beware of the Blackheart Man, (The Rasta Man). Also I really like Fighting Against Convictions, The Oppressed Song, Reincarnated Souls, Armagideon and of course the wonderful This Train (the good version 8:28 long). Of course this album is a certified classic, so it is devoid of bad songs, so the ones I failed to mention are very well, in their own right. The bottom line, this album was originally released in 1976, I was born in 1981, I've been listening to it my entire life on vinyl, this year it has been re-mastered on cd, and it sounds wonderful, trust me, if you like reggae music or if you just generally love good music, then Blackheart Man is for you.

This album is amazing! Flat out. If you love dancehall its a necessity. First of all, you have Bounty Killer, Mr. Vegas, Mad Cobra, Red Rat, T.O.K. and Elephant Man, on the same rhythm, on the same record! Thats enough right there. Now you add Beenie Man to that, with a remake of R. Kelly's &quot;I Wish&quot;. Listen to the lyrics on that one. Bounty Killer probably rides this rhythm the best though with TOK on Man Ah Bad Man, you have to hear that to believe it, trust me its hot. Throw in Mad Cobra with Anything, and you get some unusally aggressive lyrics from Cobra. Elephant Man is in top form here on Behave which you can just see whining going on to as soon as you hear the song. Also, you have Goofy riding the rhythm on No Check which is hot as well. Mr. Vegas is in top form as well on Go Up. Ring is the first time I've heard Kiprich in a song by himself as he usually rolls on the rhythms with Lexxus but he definitely holds his own. I've never heard of Desperado or the Monster Twins but they collectively do a decent job on this track. TOK's own song Shake Yuh Bam Bam is hot and brilliant dancehall. Frisco Kid is in top form as well on Zion which almost doesn't seem to fit on this rhythm. Take Mr. Easy minus Baby Cham and you have a seemingly decent artist on his own as he rides with Freaky Lady. And Red Rat's Hardcore is the single reason that I'm buying his new record! Flat Out, listen to this rhythm then buy the cd its amazing. Early candidate for rhythm of the year, and dancehall compilation of the year as well.Only thing missing is some Sean Paul, but I'm sure he'll be on this rhythm by the end of 2001.

I gave this record a 4 and say I was dissapointed in it because I expected it to be one of the greatest dancehall reocrds I've ever heard. And it wasn't at all. I couldn't sit back and let it play because there are a few tracks that are really not all that. Like I really can't stand Don Yute's Gal Catalogue, his flow is not really that good, and Kiprich's Wonder Why is straight wining, it sounds like he's in pain. Also, anytime you have Elephant Man and Lexxus on the same cut you expect it to be amazing, but Bout it, Bout it is just pretty good. The best parts on this album are Spragga Benz's Call Her Name, which I am going to listen to now because it's so good. Sean Paul of course on Nah Stray and Nah Move Right with Looga Man and Delly Ranks on Dem A Plan. I just can't stand Mossy Kid's flow on anything, but Suga Mumz is one of his best if you are a fan. If you want a fantastic stroke of genius rhythm comp. then get juice or pressure cooker, but if you're desperate for some Sean Paul style flows and some top notch Spragga, then you can't go wrong right here.

Concerning the artist in question here, I can't exactly recall the last time an artist has grown on me so quickly through an album to really become one of my favourite artists at the moment. Due to the natural nature and progression of reggae music (where releasing CONSTANT singles is not exactly an indication of a forthcoming album or an album at all for that matter), the typical way I get attracted to an artist is through a steady stream of singles which, although not ALL of them will be hits, will just easily lead me to recognizing the skills of the artist and I am essentially HOOKED from that point. Recent cases of this have included, of course, young LETHAL dancehall head Bramma de Bomba who is slowly showing (at least to me) the rather elusive skill of consistency in the dancehall; prior to Bramma there was the captivating Alaine (even though she did eventually forward her album, twice) and going even further back I'll draw on names like Lutan Fyah and even Vybz Kartel, such is the normal way of today's reggae. Usually. Even with the elder and more established artists, the situation tends to be similar in a case where at that point I would have almost certainly heard their names and heard some of their music and for whatever reason, I take a listen to more recent stuff (or even older stuff in some cases) and through a selection of singles, they can actually become amongst my absolute favourite artists. Somewhat recent cases of this would be names like Yami Bolo within the last year or two, Glen Washington (nice nice pieces from Mr. Washington I've been hearing), Steve Machete from a few years back and Bahamian veteran Monty G as well, who has been heading a small but well strong contingent of artists from the Bahamas (check Jah Hem). Just from the top of my head, thinking about an artist who would have caught my attention on such a MAJOR level due largely to the strength of an album alone: The first name on the list would probably be Pressure Busspipe, whose 2005 debut album, The Pressure Is On (which, incidentally, featured Glen Washington on the album's only combination) captured not only my attentions, but many in the reggae world, including Jamaican production ace Don Corleone who has since swept down and signed up the St. Thomas chanter adding him to a small dynamic group of artists, truly near the forefront of modern hardcore reggae. Pressure's case is so unusual for me and if you asked me to list a name of my current ten favourite artists, you could definitely expect to see his name and it's been that way since that very first album reached and more times that denotes something pretty special.Apparently something else pretty special which I ran into just within the last year is the vibes of veteran UK vocalist Lloyd Brown, whose Silver album has obviously had such a wonderful impression on me. Even more downright odd is the case of Brown that I actually WELL knew of Mr. Brown prior to the Silver album and literally picked it up as somewhat of a `refreshers course' on his vibes and due to the very nice hype surrounding it (the album was celebrating his twenty-fifth year in the business) and it refreshed and impressed all at the same time. Silver was an album which was definitely impressive although it wasn't necessarily an album which caught the attentions of a flood of new fans unlike Pressure's case (obviously as the difference in the length of both artists' careers and popularity at the time of the respective albums); it really wasn't a landmark album for most people, even more odd. The bottom line in Lloyd Brown's case for me is that the man just really makes some SWEET SWEET music. You just CANNOT call yourself a reggae head and not appreciate the levels of Lloyd Brown to some degree. So powerful was Silver and Brown's vibes overall that he has not only did it lead me to more into the vibes of Brown, but also some of his peers. Just within the last year I've taken a greater look at artist who I was somewhat familiar with such as Bitty McLean, Peter Hunnigale and the WELL SOLID Peter Spence, opening up a WIDE array of even more sweet vibes as the UK artists tend to focus more on what would be long considered `old-school' but do so with a very technologically modern twist which is absolute delightful to listen to. Silver was actually Brown's eleventh album to date (and he already has number twelve loaded and ready to go shortly, more on that in a bit) which leaves ten other heaping full albums of very fine material (for the most part) to go through for me and I chose to start with the next one sequentially, 2006's Said & Done. S&D;, like Silver (and the next one) came through Brown's own Riddimworks Productions and well rising UK staple, the respected Cousins Records from Donville Davis distributing (just as they did with Silver) (and the next one). Previously, of the two well known UK labels, essentially `major' labels for reggae music, Brown favoured to do the lion's share of his business with JetStar, who tended to focus more on local talent as opposed to their neighbours at Greensleeves who almost exclusively dealt with Jamaican artists and only occasionally with the locals (and to my knowledge, Greensleeves only involvement locally was helping with distribution with UK dancehall DJ Tippa Irie) and GS, also focused primarily on dancehall at their peak as well. Now, with Greensleeves under the VP Records' umbrella (and Brown has done business with them in the past as well) and JetStar having either closed or at the very least taken a SUBSTANTIALLY degraded role in the music, Brown has found a wonderfully willing sparring partner in Davis and Cousins who have absolutely no problem shipping Lloyd Brown albums annually to the masses. Said & Done compared to Siler, in retrospect, actually stands pretty well. It's much more of a `flashy' and `dynamic' album than the straight forward and heavy Silver and if you want to even call it BETTER than Silver, I'm not going to argue with you.The well packed Said & Done gets off to a well rolling start. After a brief intro (which is TRULY an intro with a female introducing our star for the evening), things get going with the very nice Can't Get Me out, one of the real signature tunes of the album and (I THINK) a previous single as well. The song literally plays out as a testament and ode to Brown's longevity in the game and does so wonderfully! If ever there was such a simple thing to be boastful (or just simply factual) about for Brown, it would definitely be his experience in a game where faces come an go even more so than riddims and Brown delivers a message stating he's been around for such a long time, he's not a rookie (and definitely not falling for rookie folly) and he's simply not going anywhere anytime soon (the song is somewhat of a `title track` for the album as it explains all that he has said and done). Indeed! One of the biggest vibes on the album. Next up is the wonderfully vibrant U're Not Alone which sounds oddly familiar be it the nice bouncy almost ska-like riddim or just the wonderful message throughout as Brown reminds all that in our darkest days, we are NOT alone. Completing the very solid opening (and setting the table for the album's overall finest effort) is the first pure lover's tune of the album as Lloyd Brown drives a VERY clever and MATURE sexual vibes with Luv Me Long. You could vibe Vybz Kartel, Beenie Man, Spice or whoever and hear one type of definitely less `grown' sex song but Luv Me Long is one for the older crowd who REALLY know what's going on in the area! Said & Done really does get started off nicely and I make it a point to say, in contrast to the Silver album, which almost seems headstrong and determined on making its point, Said & Done, throughout, takes a few very nice twists and the vibe of the two albums really show a great contrast of vibes and something you'll only find from someone of Brown's experience and skills.That being said, perhaps in even a more unusual set of circumstances, the tune here which most catches my attentions is easily the most gimmicked on the entire album. The tune, So We Deal Wid Dem is the only official combination on Said & Done and features non other than Jamaican lover's rock legend Beres Hammond alongside Brown but does so in a weird fashion. The tune links Brown's vocals with Hammonds from the previously voiced POTENT 360 Turn and the results are MASSIVE! The original tune (which you can find on the Reggae Gold 2003 album) was more than enough on its own merits and remains one of my favourite (underplayed) Beres Hammond Tunes, but Brown takes it and makes it his own over the same Hammond and Willie Lindo produced riddim and you'll rarely hear so much talent and experience on one such tune and they both deliver (now I'd LOVE to see an official combination between the two). Unsurprisingly, on the whole Said & Done is an album highlighted by the big lover's tunes throughout. On paper, the one which catches the most attention is definitely Let Me Love You, which is a remake of an American tune (I believe sung by Mario), and Brown really makes it work. To be honest, I don't really LOVE the original (although it is a very smooth song), but it doesn't at all bring the vibes down as Brown CLEARLY outshines the youth (big respect to Mario still). Let Me Love You is topped by the syrupy sweet classically vibed In Love. In Love is the type of tune which actually makes Brown himself, I don't think there is an artist on the current scene today who could sing the song so sweet, but if you take it and drop it in the 1970's, it would sound right at home. Truly combining the eras and truly doing a nice job at that. Still it is the final lover's piece on the album, the downright dazzling You Do Something To Me, a remake of a Paul Weller tune, which really is at the forefront of all on the album. Brown really does make some unusual, but very nice, choices in which tunes he chooses to voice as far as remakes go and You Do Something To Me is easily amongst the best of the ones I've heard thus far. Speaking of remakes, another here and one which took me a bit of awhile to recognize is New Day. The tune is one which was originally voiced by Haitian superstar Wyclef Jean and, in typical Wyclef fashion, it was kind of an EASY GOING conscious tune which really made its mark. Its definitely not a tune I would have figured Brown would have taken his own chance at (in typical Lloyd Brown fashion) but EASILY, I can say Jean would be happy with the results! I also took a liking an interest to the tune Badman Ideology which is a big diss to all those who can`t seem to mind their own business and those who judge and carry grudge. This tune flows over an amplified version of the same riddim made famous by Sizzla's and Corleone's Give Me a Try (I'd know that guitar chord ANYWHERE) and really I'm not use to hearing it actually sung and would have LONG left such a tune for death, but, again, Lloyd Brown definitely pulls it through and makes it work (I don't think I should be surprised anymore, after all Lloyd Brown is the same man who took on the DOOMED She's Royal riddim after Tarrus Riley DESTROYED it). I'll also tell you to check two tunes here I was really looking forward to hearing based on the titles alone; Irie & Mellow and I Know Jah. Irie & Mellow is pretty good (actually that WONDERFUL riddim is better than the song itself) and another lover's piece which virtually explodes during the chorus of the tune which is the best part of the song and one of the best hooks on the album period. Meanwhile, I Know Jah is simply one of the best overall songs period. I'm always interested in seeing how the UK artists who focus on the lover's rock arena so predominately, `adjust' their vibes to the rootical spectrum and Brown does so seamlessly (Peter Spence is good at that as well) as he reminds all that His Majesty is with you at all times, even when you think He isn't. Said & Done ends with a very interesting and equally impressive tune (really one of the album's best), the Outro which is essentially a Nyahbinghi chant which REALLY caught me `off guard'. I would DEFINITELY love to hear more of such efforts from Brown in the future, as , again, an artist of his stature proves himself capable of just about ANYTHING in the game.Oh, and well check Press Start. Big tune!Overall, I'm definitely recommending Said And Done by Lloyd Brown for the more mature reggae fan looking for a bit of UK spice in their vibes. While I still favour Silver which, as I mentioned, had such a profound effect on me and was ultimately responsible for me checking Said And Done in the first place, the gap in quality between the two is VERY slim if it exists at all. The vibes here are, for the most part, a bit more liquid and flowing, which definitely shows a bit of a different side to the artist, but both really stand as testaments to his overall skill. Furthermore, Lloyd Brown has already tipped his hand at his third Cousins album in as many years as he'll be presenting the potentially MASSIVE Brownie Points later this year as well, definitely looking forward to that one. Really you won't find too many making reggae music who are more skilled and EXPERIENCED as Lloyd Brown and Said And Done finds him in fine form for really one of his best albums to date.

Production/artists team Lef Side and Esco have more than made themselves a household name in dancehall over the last two years. Previously, both had been involved in the music as sound men and egineers, Lef Side had even been one of the more sought after young session drummers in all of Jamaica. The two had somewhat become the 'Boy Wonders' of dancehall, in a world where Boy Wonders can become king, just overnight.That 'night' came the when they released their MASSIVE Throwback Giggy Riddim and their #1 hit, Tuck in Yuh Belly. The song was one of the biggest of 2005 and attracted attention farther than just tiny little Jamaica. It wasn't even their best work, looking back, the duo was the mastermind behind such ultra popular riddims as the Martial Arts, Chiney Gal and Double Jeopardy (in part) riddims.They tapped VP (as they generally do) to release their latest and darkest, Dem Time Deh riddim. The DTD is a newage smokey dancehall floor jam! Although the riddim never really deviates from its base, the base is so addictive and catchy that you really wont mind over the relatively short 16 track album. This is yet another example of fine 'riddim management': While there is certainly a number of other wonderful dj's who would have done the DTD more than justice (namely Beenie Man & Busy Signal), Lef Side and Esco kept it simple, you have a newschool riddim, get newschool artists.Thus, the best tune here comes from probably the artist closest to even eclipsing the new age (a spaceage dj?), the Time Minister Vybz Kartel. 'No' is extremely typical Kartel, it follows one of the 3 G's (girls, guns and ganja, girls in this case) but he does it in his own special way and No runs the DTD through its paces and back!The second biggest hit here is a little surprising considering that this artist was around and just absent from the Throwback Giggy riddim. Sean Paul turns the clock back and recaptures his old school style of pattern over style and he LOCKS OFF the DTD on his All Out. Also check extremely talented new comer Idonia's Ukku. Of course the tune is way slack, but this riddim was made for winners like Ukku.The duo themselves touch the riddim on three different occasions once together and two individual tracks (and i'm wondering what happen to Dr. Evil?). The best of these is EASILY Esco's solo track No Caine as he flexes straight dj style and is very very impressive. Ele is typical Ele as he goes Nelly Furtado on his darkest Gal Bruk.Bounty Killa is the only artist who goes serious on the DTD on his fine Folitician. And of course check Assassin's Hotter Than her, predictably impressive from the young veteran; and the album's final voicing comes from THE ANGELIC ALAINE! Her excellent Give You is a fine way to wrap up the artist's portion of the Dem Time Deh riddim.Overall, although the Dem Time Deh is without a doubt scored for the fan of modern dancehall, its not SO out of the box that most dancehall fans won't be able to appreciate it. Fine artist selection by Lef Side and Esco over a stellar riddim makes the Dem Time Deh one of my 'Dark' Horse favorite riddims of the year.

I don't know how this happens, as yet another big time and big name artist seemingly 'bites the dust'. Every year, a particular label named Penitentiary manages to steer artists (or their produces) into releasing artists for the label, despite allllll the various warning signs not to. To date, just in my memory, the label has: Most heinously released a rather generic sounding Burning Fire album from Sizzla Kalonji which was a complete waste of time for fans as it contained 14 tracks which had previously been released on various albums (If I recall correctly it was from the Taking Over and Jah Knows Best Albums); of course they identified that problem and 'corrected' it by re-releasing the album a few months later, this time with 3-4 songs never available on any Sizzla album (just to my knowledge) but, again, the majority of the songs were from previous albums as well, and none were of the artist's best talent. Their next take at an album from the same artist, Jah Protect was another fumble, again, most of the tracks appeared on different albums and their most recent effort from Sizzla, Children of Jah was completely useless as it had the same problems as its two elder brothers. Combine that with the fact that they routinely manage to get the absolute worst albums from their various big name artists, hardly ever manage to get decent liner notes (if any at all) besides the tracklist and some lame album description (and ALWAYS attribute the publishing of the entire album to the generic 'copyright control') and generally don't get the tracklist itself right (see Anthony B's atrociously bad lineup for the nice Confused Times album) and you wonder exactly how the land these big names to record for them.Besides an annual album from Sizzla and Anthony B, Penitentiary regularly releases material from some of Jamaica's top roots talent such as Luciano, Capleton and Junior Kelly and have actually even released a Dennis Brown album (2005's Timeless). Now, they have managed to lure in current big time hitmaker, the sublime Richie Spice and the release of his debut album for the label couldn't be anymore suspect. Besides the fact that its released just 6 weeks after the nice (and legitimate) VP Records debut of Spice, the similarly titled In the Streets to Africa (which actually contains a song named Motherland Calling, which is actually on this album under the title Everything), thus attaching Motherland Africa to the heavily promoted In the Streets to Africa by simply being there. Even on Amazon you can see the two being offered as a pair. Whether intentional or not (although I'm going to assume it was, as even the ultra laid back peace loving Luciano has previously complained on Penitentiary's release schedule), it seems as if the unknown heads at Penitentiary almost plan to use the promotion of one album to do the work for them (and it succeeds!), as the asking the question to a fan 'did you pick up Richie Spice's new album' suddenly becomes a double headed question.Besides those problems, Motherland Africa also has a couple after you actually get it and open it. Inside in the album in the paragraph and a half long liner notes it says that Motherland Africa is full of brand new hits. . .The opener on Motherland Africa is a song entitled, How. Any fan of the artist will immediately recognize the song as Blood Again, which was kind of old when it was released on Spice's Spice in Your Life album, originally in 2004. And while, by far, my greatest critique of the In the Streets to Africa album was that it was actually much more of a compilation due to the fact that much of the album had been previously released singles, that album has nothing on Motherland Africa, 100% of it is previously released singles! So, either the label just flat out lied or they just don't know their business very well, and due to the overwhelming amount of material they seem to release, I'm almost certain its the former and not the latter, unfortunately.But, on top of all of that, what is most frustrating about Motherland Africa (as was the case with Anthony B.'s Confused Times), the album is quite solid. Yes, far much more of a compilation than an actual album, but a decent compilation of material 1-4 years old. It would be very very easy to ignore were it not for that fact (although, in the end, I'm STILL not recommending it). The album even has a flow to it, its a very laid back type of vibes, with a few change-ups here and there, and pretty much everything you've come to expect from the artist in a fine form.Probably my favorite tune here is the track #12. . .Let me try to clear up the tracklist for them! Track 12, which is called I Don't Need Your Loving on the album, is actually the bouncy and nice nice Just the Other Day which track 14 is called. Track 14 is probably Friday Face, and the track that is called Friday Face, #4 is actually, Glad I Got You over the Lava Splash riddim, Now Your Mine which is the title given for track #8 which is actually I Don't Need Your Loving which is track 12's given title and I'm back to where I started.The overall point being, if I can sit here and listen to the track and say what it is, and I have absolutely no vested interest in how the album is presented, you would think someone who is actually spending money on it, might take a listen to it before releasing it. Apparently Penitentiary is run by 5 year olds who just really don't care what goes out of the door with their name on it.As I was saying, I like track 12 the best, the first time I heard it was on the Toe to Toe Vol.9 album with Spice and Jah Cure, loved it ever since. Also check the aforementioned Everything (Motherland Africa here) on track 7 over the excellent (and now 3 year old) Maroon riddim. I like track 3 as well, Motherland Africa (which is actually Honey in Dem Face, really one of the most lovely tracks I've ever heard from Spice, and a very very nice vibes.Unfortunately, from a music standpoint you can't fault the artist at all, actually if this album had come forth about a year to 18 months ago (from any other label) I'd probably be reserving a spot for it in the year end's 'Best of' list, instead, I'm far more interested in the series of just curiously bad decisions which led to its birth. In an industry which the top of the top class acts release several albums a year (speaking strictly in the roots arena now) and receive virtually no returns from albums, with pieces like this, it seems to be going back. Look at any cover from any Penitentiary release and it'll be some generic, picture as the case of Sizzla's Children of Jah of Confused Times, or, like Motherland Africa, a picture from an apparent concert, microphone still in hand. This rather archaic and 'bootleg' method of making albums (particularly for the reggae genre which needs all the help we can get) needs to end and unfortunately for the unsuspecting fan the allure of getting the 'new Richie Spice album' may overtake the proper decision.Overall, were ou to just sit down and listen to this album tune for tune, you would most likely enjoy it. Its a very nicely done compilation of roots reggae music from one the genre's finest practitioners at the height of his respective powers, and how can you really go wrong there? Well, if there is a way to go wrong there Penitentiary has managed to find it. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU CONSIDER PICKING THIS ALBUM UP! NONE! Although it is 'the new Richie Spice album' spending money for such a piece can only mean that he'll have another one just like it next year, save it!

Its difficult to get excited for any release by Sizzla. Generally because of his extreme recording schedule, often times there will only be a month or two worth of build up time to any given album. However, I must say the fanfare and critical anticipation surrounding his latest album, The Overstanding has been huge and buzzing for nearly 2 years now ever since his signing to rap mogul Dame Dash's record label, ultimately releasing the album through Koch.There were local concerns as well as to how Sizzla, who is one of a very select few of artists who are UNIQUELY Jamaican, would crossover to the US market; also if he would somehow change his musical style. In the meantime, another of the concerns, whether or not Sizzla would be limited to exclusively recording for Dash have been flattened as he has continued to freely record and has released roughly 6 albums since the announcement of the deal through the usual 'suspects' (i.e. Greensleeves, VP, Jetstar etc.). Another of the concerns was could he actually sell records to a market which is nowhere near used to nor as accepting of his fiery brand of roots reggae music.Sizzla's popularity here has been at an all-time high following periods of his career where his motivations for entering a musical 'experimental phase', during which he recorded many slack songs, were questioned constantly. As well as the immense critical acclaim garnered by 2002's Da Real Thing album, the effects of which can certainly still be felt today as he releases his major debut, The Overstanding.The first thoughts here are that the concerns of a potential crossover attempt are almost immediately squashed by just looking at the tracklist of The Overstanding. This album is LARGELY constructed by years and years of proven hits which is what Sizzla had suggested it would be, as an attempt to see if fans abroad could accept the artist at his finest. But they made a little mistake in re-recording (by my ear) all of them! So you won't get the best versions of the tracks on The Overstanding, still it is a solid album.The best track here, as it is on any album on which it shall EVER appear, without a doubt is Black Woman & Child. The song which is the title track of Sizzla's finest album (if they really wanted to present his at his best they would have just re-released that entire album and slapped 'THE OVERSTANDING' on it) will probably still be routinely available on reggae compilations 100 years from now, its such a powerful track (and my great grandson will be sitting here reviewing those albums as well!) that it has maintained a level of high reverance in all reggae circles and has to be amongst the first tracks considered when doing a Sizzla 'best-of'. The version here isn't too bad and still the lyrics remain untouched.The re-recordings seem like they were done with live backing, which in certain situations can be very very good (particularly on Bushman's 2004 album Signs), but they are mixed here. Thank You Mamma almost seems like it was done in a club, STILL a powerful track, but I would have loved if songs this powerful, with as much new backing behind them were presented at their best. Solid as a Rock does, however, give the original a run for its money as it always one of the songs which seemingly roll easily off the tongue of the legendary lyricist.Also check some of the 'newer' material ESPECIALLY the opener, the solid solid Take Myself Away and the truly divine Beautiful Day. I've heard both tracks before, and am impressed to see them amongst the ones drafted for this project. Check Break Free,(which I'm sure was on a recent album, I'm just too lazy to look for it) but is a nice bouncy and different roots track as well as the strong Pay to Learn.The Overstanding draws 4 of its tracks from Da Real Thing album, as I mentioned, they are all redone, however, for what the album is attempting to do in exposing the artist to a wider fanbase, I think it was a good idea (not the re-recording part) to include those tracks.Overall, of course recommending a Sizzla album to a Sizzla fan is like recommending a mouthpiece to a boxer: They'll already have it. But I'm VERY interested in seeing if the world beyond reggae heads will pick up The Overstanding, and perhaps go and then research the IMMENSE catalogue of Sizzla Kalonji. While being pretty much a middle of the road album for Sizzla in terms of quality, hopefully it will bring the world closes to one of the best hidden talents of all time.

This is the first Vegas album that I bought, and I have to say that I think it is pretty good. Having heard several of the songs before buying the record on several other compilations, (i.e. Duppy Durex, Go Up, Some-Boy and certainly Hot Gal Today) I was very interested in hearing the rest of the record. The best song on the album is Kokane, its easily one of the best songs that Vegas has ever done. There's a song that I heard, and immediately I thought that it sounded like a little like a Cecile song, and Cecile wrote and produced the song, Damn Right, it is very good. Duppy Durex is also a very good song. I didn't give this album a 5 because of the several bad songs that are here, I would've definitely given this one a 3.5 if I could've. There is a remake of Donnel Jones' Where I Wanna Be, which is just odd. I Love Dancehall, Sha-La-La and Oh What a Night are pretty bad. On the plus side, Bun It, with Elephant Man is good, so is Dem Fraid. The biggest thing about this album is that it is sans Vegas' best song Mek Mi Se Di Hand Dem Sway, which would have been perfect here. You have to get Riddim Ryders Vol 1 if you want it. Overall it is a very good album, uses good rhythms, and Vegas fans will be in heaven here.

The best thing that I can say about Tropical Storm is that it is probably the best sounding album that I have bought this year. I mean, the production here is top notch, including the Neptunes, and dancehall burner Dave Kelly, each on multiple tunes. Of course, as all the albums Beenie Man puts out on Virgin will be, Tropical Storm is a crossover attempt for Beenie Man, and based on the material that Beenie has done for his entire career, he certainly is entitled to have crossover attempts, and he does these type of records better than anyone in the dancehall.As for the album itself, there are no bad tunes, although Fresh From Yard is kinda funny with Lil' Kim doing her best patois impersonation, but ultimately referring back to her usual clothes/car/jewelry type of flow. This is a crossover attempt, but Beenie didn't completely ignore the dance with his hit Ms. L.A.P., with Anthony Kelly on the board for that one. Also check the poorly titled Street Life, and the equally poorly titled Dave Kelly produced Gangsta Life, both are very good tunes, Gangsta Life, being one of my favorite on the album, its a pure head knocker from Madhouse, as always. My absolute favorite tune is Bossman with Sean Paul, and the Empress Lady Saw, a Neptunes production, that has somewhat of a dancehall feel to it. Also really like Yagga Yo, Party Hard, Bad Girl, Pure Pretty Gal, You Babe, and I even like Feel It Boy, with Janet Jackson. Overall, I've had this album for about a week, and I don't really like hip-hop anymore, but I've played it for friends that do like hip-hop and they really enjoy it: Of course Beenie's fans are going to get it, but if you're a hip-hop head, you might like this one as well in your collection. Also, on the dancehall side, bigup to Beenie for basically ignoring all the war stuff which has hit dancehall hard in the last year, he never calls out any name, and also bigup to Bounty Killer as they have suposedly squashed their conflict (I know its happened before, but I think they mean it this time). Pick this one up, unless you're expecting a straight dancehall project, you won't be dissapointed.

Coming again from the Lustre Kings crew is the sequel to one of the best modern reggae compilations that I have ever heard. Culture Dem (di original) came out of nowhere, no one outside of the west coast had ever heard of the Lustre Kings before (myself included) and it was just a delight to listen to (and a mystery that all of these artists had found themselves out to record full tunes with LK). Nevertheless, today that album is somewhat of an underground reggae cult classic, Culture Dem was mad!What we get in round 2 is a not quite as good, but still highly relevant copy of the original. It follows much of the same track in that it's separated between a few different riddims (the No Polotics, Credential, Alarm Clock, Liberation, Shining, and Talking Drum riddims) and each artist adds his/her sound over it, sort of like a non continuous mixtape. Like its predecessor, its a complete Rasta affair and some of the bigger names in all of reggae are present; Luciano, Turbulence, Natty King, Jah Mason, Capleton and Yami Bolo. Sticking out as a missing trooper on this front is of course Sizzla Kalonji, but he has been replaced by bothe veterans Spragga Benz and Determine (who fits right in place working with the LK's).The best tune on the entire album comes on the album's best riddim, the Alarm Clock, by Natty King who continues to blur the line between his own sound and that of Luciano and Bushman on the truly wicked See the Wicked Run. Also love, of course Turbulence's Music is Life and Natty King's combination with the very animated Al Pancho on Man of Truth on the No Polotics. The unknown Jah Dan makes a good contribution on Beauty of the Beast on the Liberation riddim as does Yami Bolo & Capleton in a combination on the riddim's namesake.The only areas of concern I would say would be the only woman on the album, the unknown Empress Michiboo on Breath of Life, her voice takes AWHILE to get used to, and the Shining riddim, is wicked! But it only goes on for 2 tracks, both of which, by Jah Mason and Jah Marcus are wicked (Lutan Fyah's Raid di Barn would have looked nice). The album ends with the hip-hoppish/bollywoodish Talking Drum riddim on which vet Determine absolutely locks off the flow on Who Yu.Overall, this is by no means as crucial as the monster which preceded it in the Culture Dem series (even the cover on the first one was much better, although this one is VERY good as well), but you won't find too many Rasta compilations out a road which carry a bigger bat than Culture Dem Vol. 2, I'm eagerly awaiting what may come of #3.

In reggae we have `King' Yellowman. We have Beenie Man, the `King of the Dancehall`. We have Bounty Killer, the `Warlord'. We have Capleton, the `Fire King'. We have Super Cat, the `Don Dada'. We have Lady Saw, `The Queen of the Dancehall'. We also have Dennis Brown, the `Crown Prince of Reggae' and Bob Marley, `the King of Reggae. Some of these titles were earned (some to far greater degrees than others), some were simply bestowed upon the particular artist for some reason or another, and some even still were bestowed upon the particular artist by. . . well that particular artist, his/herself, and some of these artists (well most ALL of these artists) have other, in some case just as well known (such as Bounty also being referred to as the Poor People's Governor), nicknames. However, amongst all of these nicknames and the thousands of others by which other artists are known, perhaps not a single one has been EARNED to a greater scale than that of the legendary Marcia Griffiths, The Queen of Reggae. No woman (and perhaps no living male) has been a greater ambassador for not only reggae music, but Jamaica as a whole. The regal and intensely respectable (and respectful) Griffiths hasn't necessarily been as well known as some of her peers (most notably Marley's widow, Rita Marley) or as some of the younger generation of female artists (outside of Jamaica, in Jamaica you`d be hard pressed to find a living creature who didn't at least know of her), however, they ALL owe her a bit of credit as having been one of the true female pioneers in reggae music. It also doesn't hurt her respectability that not too many artists, regardless of their gender, have been more talented than the West Kingston native, that is all to be credited when one looks at what is undoubtedly Griffiths greatest achievement to date, her longevity. A staggering FORTY year veteran in the business, Griffiths holds a claim to longevity that even the most decorated of the typically fickle reggae business can't dispute. She has continued to along all the while as well, whether it be performing with Marley and the legendary I-Threes, or as she does currently, tour the world with renown singer Beres Hammond. And between Marley and Beres, even the two top notch artists cannot see Marcia Griffiths in terms of longevity (they'd have to combine their years to top her!).Undoubtedly Marcia Griffiths is best known these days for the near decade she spent in the 1970's and early 1980's touring with Bob Marley & The Wailers as part of the lead backing vocalist group, The I-Threes. The group was comprised of Griffiths, Marley's wife, Alpharita Marley, and the supremely talented vocalist Judy Mowatt and while the group went on to perform very well with Marley (as well as having some success on their own) , one could argue that Griffiths might have even had a bigger impact had she remained in her ways as she was before the group, which was as a predominantly solo artist. Having originally gotten her start with Byron Lee of Byron Lee & The Draigonaires fame (who now that I think about it is one of the very few artists around who can claim a longer history than Griffiths) Griffiiths would come into contact with several musical geniuses early in her development as an artist to whom perhaps the credit goes for delivering such an outstanding and devoted pillar of reggae music such as her. Besides Byron Lee, young Griffiths would work with, amongst others, Bob Marley, Bob Andy, Coxsone Dodd and she who was actually most instrumental to her development, Mrs. Sonia Pottinger of High Note records who most consistently put out Griffiths' music including compiling material as well as recording exclusive material for official albums from Griffiths' (most notably the outstanding Naturally album), during the first half of her career. Griffiths had already been very successful before entering the I-Threes and touring and recording with Marley, arguably just as successful as anyone in the entire camp, not named Robert Nesta at the time. As a decade veteran, she had already been half of the ultra successful duo, Bob & Marcia, with singer/songwriter Keith Anderson (bka Bob Andy).After spending her near decade long stand with the Marley camp (and to her own words learning a great deal about making music) Griffiths' , her reputation and popularity now sky high, resumed her solo career, recording in all facets of the music and establishing her legend. She would later go on to work in the dancehall phase of the music as well, and even scoring a very very unusual hit with Bunny Wailer's Electric Boogie which would spawn the very Macarena-ish (about 15 years before the Macarena) Electric Slide dance. Her career is one of legends, encountering legends, performing with legends and ultimately becoming a legend. Her own style is a very laid back one, which is perfect for reggae music. However, she occasionally reserves the right to show just exactly what she can do with her voice at certain moments. She herself will tell you that she is no great songwriter, however, all but the most studious of listeners will beg to differ as she has throughout her aligned herself with some of the finest songwriters Jamaica has ever produced. She is also, actually one of the few artists in Jamaica who have an well encompassing appeal, in that she can find her audience amongst children and the elderly just alike, with the overall message being , IF YOU DON'T LIKE MARCIA GRIFFITHS MUSIC, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU! She touches ballads and dance songs equally well and of course, her music most strikes a chord with women all over the world, definitely women of Afrikan descent as she simply sings most often for them, and their struggles and men as well, we should also be able to find a vibe in Griffiths music.Melody Life, her official anthology is a well timed downright crucial collection of Marcia Griffiths' finest material. From the earliest of days, including her first #1 song the Dodd produced Andy written Feel Like Jumping and all the way up to her current works of today and everywhere in between, Melody Life, so named after one of her more well known earlier songs, is yet another awesome greatest hits styled release from VP Records. The same label just last year released a double greatest hits release from Bounty Killer, a double greatest hits release from Beenie Man (2000), a wonderful double piece from Beres Hammond and another double release from Sizzla Kalonji, which Griffiths' anthology most resembles. The project is entirely well done, complete with awesome liner notes from reggae historian Roger Steffans, very very rare photos and just a well put together set by the people at VP, showing the respect only naturally due to a Queen. Musically speaking, the 2 disc piece is split noticeably in half with the older and more classic vibes coming on the first disc and the newer material coming on the second. So, its quite hard to compare the discs together in terms of quality (which is what I normally do in the case of double albums like this one), but they compliment each other very very well. Also, worth mentioning is that even though Griffiths has had such a long career and undoubtedly you could fine more greatest hits albums from her, this is without a doubt, the begin all and end all when it comes to such an album for her, Griffiths and VP has done an almost overwhelmingly good job with Melody Life.The first tune that will surely catch your attention here is Oh My Darling, a combination with Bob Marley. Its will almost assuredly bring about the `THAT'S BOB MARLEY!???' response to all who hear it! Marley and Griffiths share the Dodd production which comes off like an old post-swing era love song circa 1935 in Jamaica. The quality of the song is almost an afterthought. While it is a strong song, and would have been particularly strong in its day, the curious nature of the song is what will draw you in, no its not near the best material here overall, but you pretty much have to hear that record. The lovely lovely title track soon follows on the first disc as well. Melody Life is a rather odd choice for the name of this album as a song. It was a very popular song, but certainly nowhere near amongst her most popular and probably only those who would make the connection are reggae enthusiasts or really big Griffiths' fans in particular. But considering the story of her life, it is very fitting. This time, the song is amongst the album's finest, Melody Life sounds like something that would be sitting in God's cd player, its just a lovely song, showing Griffiths at the height of her abilities. The overabundance of vibes evident on the first disc doesn't end there however as probably he biggest hit ever and most highly regarded song is also on disc one. Young Gifted and Black is one of the coolest song's I've EVER heard. Bob & Marcia's very nice and simple covering of the Nina Simone penned track and the track which came even before her involvement with the I-Threes and shows Marcia Griffiths was truly on her way to being a HUGE star before she ever began recording with the group.I also love the way in which disc one reaches its end. Check Survival, the Pottinger piece has always been one of my favorite (and very hard to find) Griffiths tracks. I take the song as a very empowering track, not only for women, but for all people everywhere, and the pounding one drop which backs it makes it sound like something directly out of Marley's studio, but Griffiths in Pottinger's studio was equal magic and the duo made some awesome material with Survival being amongst the absolute very best. The final track on disc one is the outstanding remake of Dreamland, penned by Griffiths' good friend and fellow Wailer, Bunny Wailer. She does a job so well that it FAR and away outshines Bunny's own version, not to take anything away from Wailer, but the song (which I believe he himself adapted from another and has been remade by several others since then) has never had a greater home than in Griffiths' catalogue, again under the Pottinger banner. Disc one could have stood rather nicely (from any other label) as a greatest hits album on its own, as many of the other tracks which I didn't mention (especially the ULTRA strong combination with Bunny Rugs, Really Together), but VP gives you another disc to ponder over.The first difference between the discs is the production. The first disc was split between Dodd, Griffiths' childhood friend Lloyd Charmer and Pottinger (with Dodd getting the most work), while the second is almost completely a Penthouse operation with Donovan Germaine manning the boards for most of the disc. Disc two is where you'll find more of the tracks which are on paper as exciting as they are in the `flesh'. Check the really unusual combination of Marcia with dancehall royalty BEENIE MAN, BUJU BANTON, MAD COBRA AND TONY REBEL on Steppin` to Mount Zion. Besides the fact that she has recorded with Rebel before, this combination is one so odd, and yet it works, COMPLETELY, without a doubt the tune is one of the project's finer pieces overall. Also check the wonderfully nice combination Live On with touring partner Beres Hammond. Having seen the duo perform the song several times over the last few years, I still hold a special appreciation for the song which they do so so well. I'm also very very fond of the penultimate track her, the divine All My Life combination with young dancehall singer Da'ville. Da'ville holds his own with the Queen and the unlikeliest of combination is actually one of my favorite current tunes, I love the song. Also check the closer, Wave Your Banner, which is a very nice Cocoa Tea produced piece.All of that doesn't even tell the whole story as the two tracks which in my opinion the strongest on the project are here on disc two. Check the outstanding Stepping Out of Babylon which Griffiths did for Mrs. Pottinger (noticing a trend here about quality with Mrs. Pottinger?). The track, written completely by Griffiths, is actually versed as a Rastafarian track which was one of the very first times Griffiths had done such a thing on a song, and she made a very very lovely decision in doing it, as Stepping Out of Babylon is one of the greatest roots tracks you'll hear from an era in reggae music in which roots was king. The absolute best track on the entire project is definitely I SHALL SING. You really get a summation of the entire piece with the track when Griffiths says, `I SHALL SING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!'. I hope so!Overall, this one is a no-brainer, definitely pick it up. I just love the way VP produces these greatest hits albums, I don't listen to much music which isn't reggae, but I can imagine this is exactly the way in which other more mainstream musical genre's have their best produced. Everything here is on point in that aspect. Musically, Marcia Griffiths' game is second to none having recorded some of the most beautiful music Jamaica has ever heard, if you're not a fan then this is definitely one to wrap your hands around for a healthy introduction to Griffiths. And for the hardcore Marcia Griffiths fans you need not worry, this piece is very very well done with Griffiths having a healthy role in its production and arrival outside of just singing the songs. You will LOVE the liners with this one, being almost like a herstory lesson. Marcia Griffiths is one of the true reigning ambassadors of reggae music, her anthology, Melody Life is certainly not to be missed.

There are a few albums to my knowledge in reggae history which have some sort of comical air about them for whatever reason. For example, there's Bushman's A Better Place (ultimately re-released as My Meditation) in response to which the artist will fairly and rightly admit that he did not want to record, and is a bad bad album. Then there are the countless (and I do mean COUNTLESS) number of reggae albums, done for major US/European labels which, due to the artist's acuity for making straight reggae and the label's desire to make them accesible to a much larger audience, made the results HORRIBLE.Perhaps such an album exists in Louie Rankin's Lethal Weapon. The notoriously bad album which was the Rankin's second shot at the semi big leagues after the well solid Showdown. Louie Rankin will probably hold a special place in the hearts of most 25-30 year old Jamaicans who grew up on his vibes; as well as for similarly aged Americans who will remember the name as Ox from the urban action film, Belly, or perhaps even more recently as Teddy Bruk Shut in the Jamaican urban thriller, Shottas.Me personally, I grew up with Rankin being one of the most in demand dancehall artist anywhere in Jamaica. While not as talented or skillful as some of his peers of the time (i.e. Supercat & Papa San) or as popular as others (i.e. Shabba, Cat, Cobra) but what he lacked in those departments, he made up for in sheer determination. The constant (and unfortunate) sparring partner of such artists as Supercat and Cutty Ranks, Louie always aimed to give just as good as he got in the warfilled days of the early 90's. He too attracted the attention gained by artists like Shabba and Buju Banton for the genre and Rankin was much part of the 'dancehall bleeding' performed by foreign labels as they swooped down and signed up virtually every mid-level to big named lyricist in thedancehall.But then came the Lethal Weapon.There are 13 tracks and O-N-E is completely worth hearing, not surprisingly its the title track. The song was actually big and popular enough to make it to the tracklist for the Lethal Weapon 2 motion picture, and looking back on the Rankin's entire career as a whole, it was one of his biggest hits. It was what you would find throughout his career as he spent his time building strong badman and war anthems, Lethal Weapon was amongst his best.Add the SOMEWHAT clever Buenos Dias to it and you can junk the rest of Lethal Weapon!The WORSE concept here is apparently whoever decided to title the album had yet to actually HEAR the album! Nothing besides the title track warrants such a hard hitting album, especially when you consider that the album is abou 90% LOVE SONGS! Just check the titles: Bed Talk, (the horrible) Put on Your Negligee and its (even worse) hip-hop remix, Sex Me Down, Heart Breaker and Girls Perform, all are atrocious in their own right and finds someone who really should be, focusing on pure love songs.Perhaps during the recording of this album, Rankin found himself newly in love! The result was songs like the lowest point on the album, Put on Your Negligee, on which he does nothing but exclaims his love of p_m p_m, (and dont we all love it!) and then goes BARRY WHITE of all people on the hook, my regret is that the typically cautious about whom he lent his samples to White had heard the tune and voided it! Actually, even worse than Negligee is its hip hop remix on which Rankin is joined by a group of guys all (in a rather creepy manner) ordering random women to "put on your negligee and get ready!", and I'm confident that although White made several baby-making hits in his career, NO children have EVER been conceived to the Rankin's spin on the track.Then there's the nearly equally stinky Fat Nuff which is a song about. . . p_m p_m and Girls Perform, another tune about. . . well p_m p_m. And its not just the subject matter, as a fan of Beenie Man and Vybz Kartel and a MAN myself, its one of my favorite topics of discourse, but the Rankin actually greatly fails to do the almight p_m p_m JUSTICE on these terrible album, and p_m p_ms everywhere, deserve better and should be offended.Overall, as I said regarding the only other album which I have so low a score. Should you ever be so unfortunate enough to encounter this album in some reggae section or bargin bin at your local record store, do not panic, just slowly walk backwards, never taking your eyes off of the mislead gleam of the packaging, and run away! Lethal Weapon is LETHAL to ears, cd players, phonographs, casette decks, cars, djays, dances, old people, children, farm animals. . .

This track is apparently very hard to ride: Wyclef, Capleton, Wayne Marshall, Elephant Man, Wayne Wonder, Lexxus, Kiprich, Stranger, even Mad Cobra, Mega Banton, General B, Boom Dandimite and even Bounty's prodigy Vibez Cartel all have a pretty hard time riding this track. The only 3 who do it well is Bounty, of course with a great war tune &quot;I am Who I Am&quot;, Sean Paul who can ride anything and does it well on &quot;Baby Don't Yuh Worry&quot;, and Beenie on Hands Up Deh, even though this doesn't sound like the type of riddim Beenie would excel on. Overall, I don't think that you can find Beenie's and Sean Paul's tracks on any other cd, so if you're a fan of both you may wanna pick this one up, otherwise, get Greensleeves Ragga Dancehall Anthem 2001 album for Bounty Killer's hit.Ps. the riddim itself is excellent

A few times every year, I end up rather shamefully crawling through my own closet, rummaging through that year's build up of albums, which for one reason or another, never actually made it into my cdplayer. I literally end up spending hours opening brand new packages and listening to dozens and dozens of discs. This year, like them all, there were a ton of riddim albums (i.e. the Caribbean Style, the Good to Go, the Tiajuana etc.), and also like them all, there was a crowning jewel album of the closet.This year it came in the form of the four year old From Rasta to You which i have virtually no recollection of ever buying or picking up at anytime, but I must confess to being 4 years too late to catching this bus, but luckily its still on schedule. From the moment I set it in motion, From Rasta to You has yet to leave my cd player at all! Not one time! And that was roughly 10 days ago.The forever overlooked US born Shiloh was originally cast as simply a clone of the late great Garnett Silk. His airy vocals were immediately reminiscent of Silk who was set for great things before his untimely death. Some cast the young Shiloh as the second coming of Silk and some cast him away as just a clone. But Shiloh is no clone as some of the material on From Rasta to You could definitely stand its own in any era of reggae music.FRtY is probably one of the most complete roots albums you'll ever hear, while its STACKED at the beginning there are big big giant tunes and vibes scattered althroughout the album. With production coming from veteran legendary dancehall producer Donovan Germain of Penthouse Records, the album was put in well capable hands and the results mirror such facts.With so much fine material its difficult to say what the best tune here, but if you FORCED me to pick one, I would pick previous hit Child of a King, being partial to that tune because I've seen him perform it numerous times and its one of the tunes Shiloh really gets into performing. Of course you have to check what is probably the biggest tune of his career, Are You Satisfied, his cut of Tony Rebel's Lalabella riddim which was arguably an even bigger hit than Rebel's own Jah is by My Side. Both of the tunes were so huge that they also made one of Shiloh's earlier albums as well, Babylon You Doom (and might actually make his next album as well!)Also check many of the other songs; The MASSIVE Rolling With Life Blows, one of the bounciest tunes on the album, backed with a strong Dean Fraser saxophone and a nice Lenky (who plays on almost all of the album, as at the time he was Germain's primary engineer and right hand man) keyboarding. Check the two combinations definitely; the first with Shiloh and his greatest source of inspiration, Garnett Silk himself, presenting the vocals to one his biggest hits, posthumously, Complain; and the second being a well powerful Give I Strength with Buju. Give I Strength is huge and would not have been too far out of place on Buju's own seminal classic, the aptly named (for this review) 'Til Shiloh.I would recommend each and every track on the album, but 3 more highlights I'd feel bad if I didn't mention by name; Definitely check Trodding, which is probably the best usage of backup singers on the entire album. The, unfortunately uncredited female/s backup singers do a very nice job with the song. Check the title track definitely! One of the more melodic tracks from the album, and actually an excellent title for the type of album it is, it is in fact an introduction as it is his biggest album to date. Lastly (okay i might be about to mention 2 songs!) check the divine Running Away from love and one of the best tracks on the album, the outstanding message which is Men Love Your Women. The message is pretty self-explanatory but is such a nice vibes over a timeless one-drop by Sly Dunbar and Lenky again.Overall, this is a can't miss! One of the biggest albums I've ever heard seriously From Rasta to You is big! I wish I had come across this one in the vibes of listening to his new album, but FRtY is in fact his most recent one. However, with recent hits such as the mighty Rastaman in the Hills and his works with Lionvibes, hopefully he is gathering material for the followup, because a note as high as From Rasta to You is entirely too high of a note to go out on. AMAZING!

I have only 2 minute, very small complaints about this album and then I'll launch into my cheerleading section in which I'll praise it as an early candidate for album of the year and that any reggae collection would be complete without it and it's 2 predecessors. The first of my minute complaints is that you might not get the impression from the cover alone that this is, in fact, a greatest hits compilation of the artist, Jah Cure. It's set pretty much like a regular studio album and although the cover does very well in showing you exactly whats going on with the Cure, it doesn't flatly tell you that this is a greatest hits album, and it should, in case you don't know that. The second even smaller complaint that I have about this one is that its sans Jah Cure's current massive hit Longing For on the wicked Drop Leaf riddim. A great big feather in the cap of VP would have been the gathering of that tune for this album.Okay, now besides those 2 points, if you are a lukewarm fan of roots reggae, reggae, r&b;, opera, folk, elevator music or even if you just occasionally enjoy the sound of a fan blowing, you need this album. The collector who has already bought Cure's first 2 album will buy this one anyway (I submit exhibit A for your approval. . . ME) and will be happy to find 5 songs which appeared on neither Free Jah's Cure or Ghetto Life, even though you'll have heard Good Morning Jah Jah althrough by now. The best of the new songs is probably Hi Hi with the heavy heavy Binghi drum backing it, it ascends into becoming a beautifully done African chant at it's completion. The slow winding sound of Troddin the Valley becomes addictive after a very short while and the familiarity of the riddim of Love is the Only Solution feels wonderfully simple and humble but in a great way. The other 'new' song, Give It to Them, sounds straight out of Tuff Gong and straight brilliant.This album, oddly enough, draws mostly from Cure's first album Free Jah's Cure, and not VP's own Ghetto Life (which is probably the best album I've heard in about 10 years). Besides the 5 tracks I mentioned, the intro, and King in the Jungle with Kalonji the other 10 tracks are present on that album. And I'm not complaining, you can't go wrong with any track here, but probably the best of the more familiar material is Jah Bless Me. Also love Chant with Spectacular, Songs of Freedom and Sunny Day, but as I said, they're all great.Overall, you have to throw biggups to VP for putting this one together. The beautifully packaged and well presented piece with the dove flying away on the backg is sure to attract fans who normally wouldn't purchase such a piece. And hopefully the artist, who is now entering his 6th year of incarceration for a crime which he and so many steadfastly claim he did not commit, will benefit from it. Freedom Blues is HUGE.

Turbulence appears to be taking the route of his mentor, Sizzla Kalonji, to the top. With Songs of Solomon being the 10th full length studio album from the young Turbulence since his debut in 2000 and yet another album already loaded ready to go, you would think that he sacrifices his quality for quantity and while that might be the case in some points, I've always enjoyed and been satisfied with Turbulence's releases.As with his previous releases, Songs of Solomon is on yet another different mood, for the most part it appears as if though young Turbulence has fallen in love. And it is highly interesting to hear the artist try and master the love song. One thing you can always say about Turbulence is that he always gives his maximum on a track. Sometimes listening to some of his peers it seems as if though they've been in the studio a little too much over the years.The best song here, oddly enough, is called Who Dem, which is one of the cultural songs on the album, the way he wrote the very very different chorus is so interesting. Also love Anytime, big big tune there. Of the love songs, the best is probably Always in my Heart, also like Slim Girl and What Can I Do?Songs of Solomon is quite different in the different moods and vibes that Turbulence goes through. Not just with his typical internal debate of whether to sing on a track or dj (which is always a fun debate to 'watch' him have) but exactly where he wants the album to go. With such a title as Songs of Solomon I was thinking heavy, heavy roots, not the case.Overall, Songs of Solomon is right in the middle of Turbulence's albums, its decent and certainly more than listenable, but we're still waiting for the artist to hit that level which he hit on the massive Join Us. From what this album and quite a few others have shown, we wont be waiting long.

I've always enjoyed Luciano's style of making reggae music. The ultra laid back vibes that he brings forth on every track is, at times when everything is just right, an utter joy to behold. And while Jamaica boasts several similarly baritone voiced singers (i.e. Bushman, Natty King etc.) none can exactly capture that easiness of vibes which natural come from any Luciano top flight track.I'm also a fan of compilations, especially ones which are unique and the idea of a compilation of all combinations or 'duets' is a very nice one. Previous albums, to my knowledge, were released for such artists as Buju Banton and Barrington Levy, and the top class artists with whom Luciano has collaborated during his fantastic career definitely makes him a natural for this type of an album. Be it the smooth vocals of fellow singers Cocoa Tea and Beres Hammond, or the gruff rhymes of dj's Sizzla Kalonji or Terror Fabulous, Luciano has voiced with a virtual whose who of modern reggae (including Anthony B, Capleton, Turbulence and Lutan Fyah all of whom are absent from Duets).There are a lot of unusual combinations on the album. And it spans a great deal of time as far as both the era of the artist's with whom he collaborates and the actual recordings themselves. Also included is the nice nice not so reggae combination with Afrikan Star Baba Maal, one of the very best tunes on the album, bridging the gap between traditional roots reggae and traditional Afrikan chanting. Its a very very nice changeup for what one might expect. Also a nice changeup is the inclusion of Hold on Natty, the wonderfully nice combination with reggae LEGEND Marcia Griffiths. In the 20 tracks, Hold on Natty is the only combination with a female (I would looooooooooove Luci to do a combination with TnT songstress Queen Omega) which is always nice to hear.The 'meat' of the album ranges from the wonderfully healthy Xterminator years (although void of any combination with Luciano right hand man Mikey General) as well as post Xterminator years. Check one of the album's finest efforts in the MASSIVE Mr Governor with Cocoa Tea! Mr Governor is a superbly done track and even the contrast of singers with Cocoa Tea being the lighter more melodic singer and Luciano being the more lyrical heavy voiced singer. Wonderful track! Also have to check the even bigger Cocoa Tea combination Rough (incorrectly credited on the disc as ROYAL) Inna Town. This song was actually a big hit and its a little different in terms of direction. Its not as melodic as Mr Governor which is actually voiced over a modified version of the Sleng Teng riddim, however, Rough is still a big track and one of the few tracks which I sung from beginning to end on the first listen.Luciano's most popular sparring partner is without a doubt Sizzla Kalonji. As the only 2 artists who have ruled Xterminator with an iron fist, both Luci and Sizzla were developed by the watchful hand of Fattis Burrell and they mesh together very well on their 4 tracks. The most interesting of which is without a doubt Born in Famine a bouncy vibe with a nice message which also includes fellow Xterminator artist Jesse Jender (aka Congo Jessie). That tune is only outdone in terms of quality by the absolutely DIVINE In This Time from the pair, which appeared on Sizzla's Royal Son of Ethiopia. In This Time is a perfect track and probably the album's second best tune (and I also have to recommend Jah Line, the nice admonishment of a tune between the pair which is the only song they did together here which I couldnt remember).While Sizzla definitely proves to be a worthy spar and the most popular, the BEST is old school foundation dancehall dj Charlie Chaplin. The two combine on the first track, Jah is Alive, which is without a doubt the strongest track on this MASSIVE album. Jah is Alive is a message song, its a vibes song and probably has the best hook on the entire album. Its just an all around powerful track which might be worth teh price of admission on its own. Also check the 2 coming back together on the nice Ain't Giving Up which is another strong track and probably in the top 5 on the album.And lastly worthy of a mention is the 2 combinations with Beres Hammond, No Gabon and Every Man Has His Way, respectively. The two are very very strong tracks and is nice looking at the virtual parallels of the two artists, both similarly respected in different ways. Also check the nice In This Together with dj's Terror Fabulous and returning Luciano spar Louie Culture, very strong cultural tune; Rebel With a Cause which was a very popular track with old school dj Josey Wales; and lastly the beautiful What We Need is Love with constantly (and almost CRIMINALLY) underrated singer Spanner Banner. OH! And I'd be downright stupid (and I may already be for not mentioning it earlier) Psalm 24, an absolute magical track with Dub Poet Mutabaruka! Psalm 24 is amongst not only the album's strongest but is of the stronger tunes of either artist's career.Overall, I'm definitely giving the Duets album a rather huge seal of approval. Luciano's abnormally high activity level throughout his career has made such an album possible and relatively easy to compile. Of course, old fans will definitely have their fair share of tunes which they think are missing or were worthy of such an album (like myself, wondering what happened to Zinc Fence Jungle with Anthony B). However, this one is packed with more than enough top flight material for any Luciano fan to enjoy. NICE!

Adn we were led to expect that things like Ain't Gonna See Us Fall, the latest release from reggae's busiest man Sizzla Kalonji, wouldn't be so quick to happen in 2006.With his signing to a major label in 2005, 2006 figured to be a watershed year for the high priest of reggae. More attention, more mainstream attention, more touring and less time in his relentless recording schedules. The results haven't been what have been expected, the 'watershed' album has yet to be released, Sizzla remains first in the minds of reggae fans and no more close in the minds of non-reggae fans, and we can still pretty much mark him down for a healthy 4-5 studio albums per year.The first of which this year is Ain't Gonna See Us Fall. Named after a decent (and overrated) hit for Kalonji. The result is an album which is both ridiculous and serene and everywhere in between.AGSUF begins with nearly the complete first half of the album in super-overdrive as he floats through tunes as hard as possible such as Judgement Tek Dem, Rich & Beautiful and Run Out Pon Dem. For my money, the best of these early songs is clearly Judgement Tek Dem.Then it gets differen. The half/third of the album consists of Sizzla tackling older sounding riddims and doing for the first time. The change is sooooooooo completely sudden that you sort of get the idea that it was set to be that way by the programmers. The best of these tunes (and thus the album's finest effort) is absolutely Somwhere over the massive Father Jungle Rock Riddim (aka, the Can't Satisfy Her riddim). I also love Knowing Each Other which may be one of the single best love songs the artist has ever done. Also love the wonderful Thanks and Praise (which I was hoping was on the album when I got it.Overall, for fans of the artist you can liken Ain't Gonna See Us Fall to a combination of albums, think the misplaced intensity of Stay Focus with the laid backness of Brighter Day, with just a dash of Rise to the Ocassion! And even though VP's own chose to tap themselves as director, the music here is generally provided by the excellent young Free Willy Camp. Of course you'll get around to this one if you're a fan, you'll be getting this one shortly I'm sure! All others, be warned, but still more thna recommendable.

(2.5 Stars)Typically in Dancehall music (and actually in all Jamaica music) there is a certain period of gestation for soon to be 'big' artists. It can be a year, it can be two or it can be three, but there is a nice little period between an artists first big tune and his/her first album, no matter how big or small the eventual label. Enter Ms Thing, the newly engaged soon to be 18 year old with the seriously unusual flow. By virtue of her megahit combination with dancehall King Beenie Man, Dude, Ms Thing has propelled herself into an album.Miss Jamaica's problem is not with its star, but it is. For her age and disposition she shouldn't really be able to ride the toughest riddims from her parent company Shocking Vibes, or her. . . (Uncle company?) Madhouse, where she is as much of a member of the Alias Project not named Dameon Beckett, or Vendetta. But she is afforded them for the albums sake. Songs like (especially) Regular, I Want It All, Hot and Rich & Famous shows Ms Thing struggling in situations where she shouldn't have ever been placed. Also, the odd sounding Ms Thing & The Doctor, which is a song from Beenie Man's latest album Back to Basics changed and added with more Ms Thing (which is honestly something that was missing big time on the original Doctor Mi Rate Yu). And even still the combination with superstar lyricist Vybz Kartel, its listenable but if you have something in your mind as to what it might sound like when its called It Haffi Good, you're probably right. What's also screwed up about this album is that if Ms Thing wrote anything on this album you wouldn't know it. Most of the writing was left up to the producers of the particular track and Dave Kelly (and I would guess Baby Cham as well). And yet even still something else wrong here (besides Dude not being on the album)is that its edited! I don't know exactly what kind of audience Sequence Records are going for here, I would guess the younger crowd, but tunes like It Haffi Good and the serious dirty Muscle Tight (which is exactly what you think it is about) are not aimed at that crowd.Thats the bad! The good here is that there are a few good moments here. The (dirty) tune Jump Up & Rail shows Ms Thing riding one of the sickly toughest riddims to come down K-Licious in a long time. The tune Get that Money with Jimmy Cheeztrix shows Ms Thing's unusual. . . almost autobot computer style flow and shows you probably what Dave Kelly saw when he met her. And the closer combination in which she pairs with the equally young sounding Sugar Daddy Sweet Soca Music, probably the best of the album, its cute.Overall, for all this album's faults, NONE of them fall on the feet of the artist. Ms Thing probably did exactly what she was told. The result is an over-produced album which does its star no good besides exposure. To Sequence Records, take the handle off next time, let us actually meet Ms Thing, and not Dave Kelly again, Tony Kelly again, Vendetta again. . .

Reserving a spot somewhere at the end of the year for Anthony B on the reggae best of list is almost a given yearly as the artist rather calmly applies his philosophy: Another year, another big album. Following a rather modest yet successful 2006 which saw one of reggae's most consistent children release just two albums, including the very well-received Suffering Man album for TAD's, Anthony B has wasted not a moment in getting the jump on early 2007. Thus, despite other albums from artists of much higher profile (PROFILE, not caliber) also being released at the same time (I.e. Richie Spice and Elephant Man on the same day, and Turbulence, Luciano and Stephen Marley within the month) and some typically downright bad pre-promotion by label Greensleeves, Anthony B's first contribution of 2007 has become one of my most anticipated releases of the year (not too anticipated however, considering GS only made us aware of it less than a month ago). What you can normally expect from AB is some of the biggest vibes in modern roots music today, while not being as spectacular as his closest peers such as Sizzla, Capleton and the emerging Turbulence, when the question is consistency, he is almost unrivaled.The Trelawny native has become one of reggae's most unlikely heroes of sort. Coming to power from the beginning of his career as a Bobo (which is quite common today, but as recent as a decade ago was somewhat rare) chanter and never straying from a righteous path which has saw him drop some of the biggest roots vibes of the past decade has made AB one of the most famous performers in all of reggae as he stays both in the studio and on the road. He follows the same career doctrine as peers such as Sizzla, Luciano and Turbulence (and seemingly more and more Lutan Fyah and Jah Mason as well) in which ONLY releasing two albums in 2006 seems like a slow year for the artist on the album circuit after a 2004 and 2005 which both saw him release four albums (as well as a re-release in `04).Higher Meditation, the chanter's latest album finds him re-uniting with Greensleeves for the third time as well as the third time with UK producer Frenchie from Maximum Sounds. Previously Frenchie and AB had worked together on the strong Powers of Creation from 2004 and the even more well powerful Black Star album from 2005 on Greensleeves as well. It was largely due to the strength and success of that Black Star album apparently that the two once again united for Greensleeves to release this even stronger album. Anthony B has called Frenchie one of his favorite producers to work with and Frenchie's meandering and nomadic style of production is well matched with Anthony B as he is one of the most experienced artists in Jamaica having worked with a virtual whose-who of producers, including the biggest of names and names who will not be remembered at all (Now I'm wondering why they couldn't slap a delay on the album and ultimately release Jah Mason's Maximum Sound debut, Life is Just a Journey).Higher Meditation mirrors its two older brothers in terms of vibes (and maybe every GOOD Anthony B album ever released , and probably every good Maximum Sound release for that matter) in that the album is a pretty good mix of modern roots and modern dancehall and turning more and more towards the dancehall towards the conclusion of the album. Higher Meditation, however, dominates on all surfaces where both Powers of Creation and Black Star (perhaps to a lesser degree) were not as strong on the dancehall side as the beautiful roots they both exhibited. Higher Meditation is a complete powerhouse of an album and a wonderful progression of what Anthony B and Frenchie have been doing (so mark them as THE pair to watch in 2009!).The album starts on a powerful spot, albeit an increasingly popular manner in which to produce an album or a song. The intro is almost a combination speech between AB and HIM Himself, Emperor Haile Selassie I and a very powerful way to get the highest of meditations started off. Check the wonderful title track getting things started in that typical Anthony B freewheeling style, just a powerful track built over a lush (and I mean LUSH!) Maximum Sound riddim. Not too far down the line you get one of the most powerful tracks you'll ever hear from Anthony B (or any artist for that matter) the excellent (Just) Can't Live That Way over the well strong Jah Powers riddim. Can't Live That Way will definitely demand several spins in your players and had a mighty mighty difficult time finding its way off repeat from myself (and I did listen to the album backwards).Checking the ending, expectedly in dancehall style, is a nice combination between Anthony B and Turbulence. To my knowledge, this is the second combination with the duo (the first also had Bushman on the track on the doomed Confused Times album) and it's a very strong track, Real Warriors. Real Warriors almost comes off as a bonus on the album after already having more than delivered the high quality and top notch vibes, Real Warriors proves AB and the Sizzla prot&eacute;g&eacute;' Turbulence make a more than formidable pair as Turbulence enters an almost flawless performance. Also check No Passa Passa, more traditional style hardcore dancehall but more than appreciated because Anthony B has his turban in all arenas of reggae and is more than well equipped to ride even the most difficult of dancehall riddims.All that being said however, the best tune without a doubt on Higher Meditation is the nearly imperial combination with Natty King, Honour to Marcus. Much like Black Star the best tune here is the combination and if you thought that Jah Cure made a nice vibe with Anthony B, you need to hear Honour to Marcus! What a big combination and released in what is Black History Month in many places in the world it becomes that much mandatory of a listen, definitely worth the price of admission on its own (and due to the big vibes Natty King has been placing on the streets lately as a solo artist, I'm definitely looking forward to see if Greensleeves and/or Maximum Sounds lines up to do his sophomore album his year as well). A big respect to Marcus Garvey, and Anthony B even invokes the name of legendary Rastafarian elder and leader, the late Mortimer Planno.Other tracks that prove worthy of spins are definitely One Chalice (on which AB nicely puts it `even when I`m old and grey, I`ll still burn the herb everyday!), one of the obligatory herbalist tracks on Higher Meditation, and definitely the strongest of the two; Check Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah a pounding yet bouncy exaltation of HIM, a wonderful track on the album and lastly check Anthony B's take on Marley's Waiting in Vain with his own well done Tired of Waiting in Vain, very much so worth checking out is the only PURE love song on Higher Meditation.Oh okay and I have to mention the nice acoustic Your Time Has ComeOverall, definitely stamping the seal of recommendation and a double seal of approval on Higher Meditation and stamping as MAYBE the early lead for album of the year (with respect to Lutan Fyah!). I'm always impressed at just how easily Anthony B manages to fly just below the radar of superstardom all the while maintaining just as much respect as those who do achieve the title. The answer lies with just thumping alone constantly and consistently putting out material that most others couldn't touch on their best day and he does it so often that its difficult to ignore, even though he almost always manages to stay out of the controversy. Higher Meditation is a SMALL step below the best of his career and you need to take one small step and pick it up!

In continuing the celebration of their 30th Anniversary, UK reggae giant label Greensleeves is releasing some of the more unusual types of compilations in their most recent history. Typically, Greensleeves over the past decade has been known for pushing an ungodly amount of riddim or 'version' albums on their fans, to the point where it becomes not only hard to keep track, but hard to differentiate the riddims themselves by the time they reach Greensleeves directions. However, the past year saw a tempering of the practice and a return to artist support and development and even a return to the roots for Greensleeves who had made dancehall their sole focus over the past half-decade (save for the obligatory annual Sizzla Kalonji release). In celebration of their 30th year in business, in March of 2007 Greensleeves plans to release a greatest hits album from King Yellowman, and have already released a greatest hits from Elephant Man as well as this album, Hi-Grade Ganja Anthems.This album of course focuses on one of reggae's historically favourite topics of discourse. Recently, however, the herbalist compilation has seemingly fallen out of favour, and while the reggae compilation shelves continue to fill themselves with riddim albums and the likes of Greensleeves' other Anthems (Raggae Dancehall and One-Drop) and VP's Reggae Golds and Strictly the Bests, the solid ganja compilations have all but disappeared. Credit to Greensleeves' recent turn for the (much) better and their 30 years in the business, having built a suitable catalogue for this rather strong compilation. While this specific genre of reggae compilations has yet to produce a specific champion (while the most popular is probably the Big Blunts album from 1994) Greensleeves' Hi-Grade Ganja Anthems certainly and easily pushes itself to the head of the class with its more than solid build up.Due to Greensleeves' unrivaled (even by the 2 year younger Vp) catalogue they are able to give an excellent representation of both dancehall and entirely more rootical Herb Anthems and they select some of the best of the best (always miffed by Greensleeves' seemingly mysterious practice of keep the names of the compilers away from their endless compiltions). Greatly represented here is the early dancehall era, particularly by the singers, in which the label itself emerged. That era of the music, in particular, was in part built upon the ganja anthem and due to much of the early mistreatment of ganja and ganja users, the works were amongst the most popular in all Jamaican music at the time.Also, in contrast, greatly represented is today's modern era of dancehall, and while far more lean on modern roots tracks, Hi-Grade does a good job in representing the herb anthems of the past decade or so. Of course, with Greensleeves having almost blindly gone about attempting in collecting the biggest (and the 'middlelest' and even sometimes the smallest) riddims to emerge from JA's dancehall producer, their catalogue is brimming with some of the better herb tracks from some of the genre's better artists (although I'm somewhat surprised to see no track from GS signee Vybz Kartel, seemingly Send On or Visa would be a natural for this type of an album, especially the very popular Send On). On the whole, Hi-Grade Anthems does awonderful job of capturing both the current and the future classics of the ganjaman tracks.The album starts off with the single biggest track of them all (and, in my opinion, the single biggest and historically most significant ganja anthem in reggae history) Under Me Sleng Teng from Wayne Smith. Being built and crafted on what is perhaps the most signifcant dancehall riddim of all time by (pretty much undisputedly) the most significant dancehall producer of all time, King Jammy. And while many listeners worldwide might not even know what the song is about and certainly not the title of the song or the singer on the track, Under Me Sleng Teng is THE Hi-Grade Ganja Anthem and any album apiring to reach a truth in obtaining such a title without a doubt has to include the track.The finest of the balance of the track of the album present not too much of a drop off from the opener. Of course you'll know Pass the Tu Sheng Peng by the legendary Frankie Paul, again, one of the biggest ganja tracks in history and probably the 'easiest' listen of all the tracks on Hi-Grade Anthems. Pass the Tu Sheng Peng is an easily appreciated track by smokers and probably even the anti-ganja activists themselves. As I've heard said about the track, if you don't like Pass the Tu Sheng Peng, something is wrong with you! Big big track. Then perhaps next you'll notice Barrington Levy's original recording of Under Mi Sensi, which is an easy listener as well, but reserved strictly for the smokers, talking specifically about Babylon giving the herb and herb users a big big fight. A similar topic is expressed on the roots vibes of what is probably the next most popular track on the album, Police in Helicopter by the legendary John Holt who forgoes the lamenting route of Levy and goes on the offensive warning "If you continue to burn up the herbs, we're gonna burn down the cane fields!"Two tracks here in particular are rather unusual and rare: The equally outstanding 100 Weight of Collie Weed by the seemingly forgotten St Mary's native Carlton Livingston and Joker Smoker by the incomparable Tristan Palmer. I don't recall ever hearing either version of the album and Greensleeves boasts both to be the original 12 inch tracks. Thus in the outstanding 100 Weight of Collie Weed (biggup St Ann's!) you get the full 6:27 of the track with the second half being the dub; likewise checking in at a beautiful 7:12, Joker Smoker is the extended cut as well, and leaves absolutely nothing to be desired (with the possible exception of more divine vocals from the original Mr Palmer).Representing for the new school at the top is Beenie Man's MASSIVE 100 Dollar Bag over Goofy's bouncy Ants Nest riddim. 100 Dollar Bag is new age vintage Beenie Man, not coming from too far back, one of the biggest new school ganja tunes you'll ever hear in the dancehall and a track that I would have undoubtedly forgotten about were it not including, biggup to Greensleeves for not leaving me to forget it however. Also check one of my personal favourites, big big combination between Elephant Man and Mr Vegas, Bun It. Bun It is just a big big hype track, over one of the coolest riddims which I know not the name of (thankfully they didnt include one of the very bad remixes of the tune)!Also stepping more new school roots, check Sizzla and Tony Curtis combination Ganja in My Brain from the Waterhouse Redemption album. The tune kicks in with an r&b; styled vibes but it works as does the rather unusual combination, definitely one not reaching the heights by many of the other tracks as far as popularity (probably the only people who actually are familiar with the track have heard the WR album as well) and just a case of GS promoting their own material (Waterhouse Redemption is of course a Greensleeves album!), but a solid track nevertheless. And lastly, a similarly timed track, the wonderful Couple Chalice a day from Jah Mason over the cool Fyah riddim. Couple Chalice is truly amongst the strongest tracks on the album altogether and years from now will probably be regarded as one of the stronger herbalist tunes of the past decade or so.Overall, definitely recommending Greensleeves' Hi-Grade Ganja Anthems. The way the album runs its actually probably better suited to older fans, however you may already have many of these tracks already (thus the largest drawback to the album). That being said, due to the rarity of some of these tracks (particularly 100 Weight of Collie Weed and Joker Smoker) you may want to go through and pick it up as well. For the newer fans, it may take awhile to grow on you, but likewise there are several tracks here which you probably already are familar with so enjoying those while the balance of the album reaches you will probably be cool as well. Me myself, I thoroughly enjoy it and actually wouldn't mind Greensleeves making this a yearly compilation as well, very nice vibes.

Oddly enough, this the latest in the yearly series from reggae UK giant Greensleeves seems aimed at a slightly different target audience than just the average hardcore dancehall fan. With the presence of no less than 3 hardcore full out dancing sounds, this one seems aimed at the fairweather/wagonist dancehall fan as well. And while I'll be the first to admit that watching the live performance of such a tune is one of the best things about a dancehall show, the whole song on an album thing elludes me. I can't think of anything redeeming about listening to the fat man yell "Scooby Doo" over and over for about 15 seconds, particularly if you dont know what the dance is exactly. Besides Sky Juice's (the fat man) Dance Moves) you also have 2 tracks from Richie Feelings (one with Mentally Ill) which are essentially the same tune on a different riddim. This kind of makes the album sound like its main competitor, VP/Atlantic's honestly aimed Reggae Gold 2004 (thus the name of the review).Thats the bad. The good is that seemingly with the loss of its biggest seller and biggest name to VP/Atlantic, Elephant Man, Greensleeves has placed every last drop of its muscle and fiber into its new heavyweight Vybz Kartel. Kartel is present on no less than SIX tracks, and 5 alone, the other being a combination with Bounty Killer and Wayne Marshall. The 2 best of these also prove to be the album's best with the aimed/unaimed (depending on who you ask) Badda Dan Dem, and Real Bad Man (which is more clearly aimed at a certain 'Asian' artist). Also love Tek Gunshot and Picture This both from Kartel. One area where Greensleeves has gotten the jump on the comp is the presence of VP/Atlantic's Assassin's 1st single from his album Girls Gone Wild (of which GS owns publishing), and Girls Gone Wild is a pretty good tune here. Also love Ward 21 and Bounty Killer's Badda Than, and BK's solo with Badman Order. GS's to most recent signings Predator (who i honestly can't stand) and Kid Kurrupt are also present, Predator with Mad Sick (would love to see a tune that had not to do with Mad, Sick or Head from him)and Kid Kurrupt nearly steals a little spot light with the boast laced Punanny Chemist. Of course veterans Buju Banton, Mad Cobra and Sizzla Kalonji all earn their food without really even trying too hard, dropping fire on their three songs.Overall, I would love to see this series return in 2005 to its roots with the seriously hard tunes that its used to over the years (and a woman on the album). But what you have here is a showcase of one of the finest young talents dancehall has ever seen in Kartel, and an appetizer to his inevitable 2nd (GS) album.

What wonderful things I keep in my closet! I mentioned a couple of reviews back how a few times a year, I'll go into my closet (literally my closet) and try and pull some of the countless nameless and wholly unspectacular albums which I may have purchased (or acquired through other means) and just never got the opportunity to listen to for one reason or another.Such was the case of the Good to Go riddim album, which I remember well, as it was one of Vendetta's earlier riddims and one of my personal favorites just a few years ago. The producer, Donovan 'Vendetta' Bennett has also gone on to become, not only one of my favorites in all of dancehall (and now roots as well), but one of the top respected names in all of dancehall.But despite this, somehow, someway, this album managed to slip through my cdplayer at the time and I found it completely unopened, in my closet. As soon as I popped it in, however, I remembered exactly why I loved it. There is an odd keyboard-Spanish guitar combination which pushes the vibe so high. It almost even sounds a little like a Lenky vibe with the big vibrant keyboard. Vendetta does make subtle changes throughout the album on various tracks, generally an extra drum or something which goes along with artists melodies, and that is always a plus on riddim albums.Its somewhat hard to pick a favorite here as so many of my favorites from a few different artists are on the riddim. I even enjoy listening to Girl For Me, a combination between Lukie D and MEDIOCRE dj Bling Dawg. To say I'm not a fan of Bling's would be an extreme understatement, but the combination here is amongst my favorite tracks on the album. I'm also (rather shamefully) fond of TOK's gimmicky Tragedy part 2. The song follows the pattern of some old song which I can't remember, but I now find myself singing it sitting in the car or in the waiting room during a doctor's visit.Then you have the songs which actually did a big damage from the riddim; definitely Vybz Kartel and Wayne Marshall combination on Why You Doing It (part 2)(he should've called it the Sequel riddim), the two again teaming up on a familiar subject on the sequel to a song which was over the Krazy riddim, an even earlier Vendetta riddim. Both of Ele's songs scored well (although I'm not terribly fond of either) Stop Hitch and the better Bun Down Dat. Also check Bounty Killa's Sadda Dem, of which I am pretty fond. AND! Although I'm sad that Vendetta didn't linkup young dj Calico for the Good to Go riddim, he did link Regan and my choice as one of the strongest young dancehall lyricists absolutely smashes the GtG on his ultra clever Bran. And, I have to mention Wayne Wonder's nice In My Room, representing for the singers.ANDDDDDDD. Both 'Sassin and Degree do very nicely on their respective tunes Pull Up and Rise & Fall with both scoring the 3rd and 4th best tracks on the GtG.But the discussion of the best tracks here begin and end between two records; Check Baby Cham's WICKED Chat Tuff which finds Cham on a rare foray outside of Madhouse and a the cool confines of a wicked Dave Kelly riddim, finding himself not too far from home with Vendetta as the two create one of Cham's finest efforts ever. And the best tune here is of course, Sizzla Kalonji on Its Burning. The song still plays in dances routinely (and with the possible exception of Kartel and Marshall's combo no other tune here can claim that) and still is as huge as it was ever. Its not the most lyrically wicked you'll find the artst (but even here he's in finer lyrical form than anyone on the riddim with the possible exception of Regan), but the GtG really isn't about that, its about good vibes and a good time and NOBODY on this riddim has a better time than Sizzla.Overall, definitely if you can find this one (and as I mentioned with the others, probably in the half-off bin at your local West Indian music store) definitely pick it up. It is still, 3-4 years later, a top notch dancehall riddim and would at least spawn the same number of big tunes were it released today as it did then. And with the trends in dancehall changing nearly by the hour, the Good to Go is still a big riddim.

Roughly every 4 years or so the fraternity of dancehall elite will open its doors and welcome a 'new' member or 2. These artists aren't typically NEW at all, however, they have now reached a level of popularity and (usually) ability which warrants their promotion in the dance. A few years ago it did so and in walked Vybz Kartel and Assassin. A few years before that there was Ward 21, TOK and Ce'cile.This year its the turns of Busy Signal and Idonia. And it just so happens that Busy is up to bat first. Busy, hailing from St Ann's (home!) has somewhat followed in the steps of Kartel: An indepth idolizing of Bounty Killa, followed by a meeting with the Warlord, a few years on the underground and finally hitting the big time with his mega boomshot, Step Out. He also signed a deal for his debut (and i believe 2 followups) with UK reggae giant Greensleeves. His style could even be perhaps best described as a combination of the Killa and Kartel (as you could probably best describe Kartel as a combo of Killa and Madd Anju), and he has had much much fanfare over his seriously top notch skill.While not as lyrically dexterous as Kartel (and who is) Busy has an almost blind aggressive command over a track which makes all of his tune, if not at least worth the price of admission, then definitely worth listening. However, what he shows on his debut, which you couldn't have imagined Kartel showing. . . even until recently, is a soft spot.Taking in account that Step Out is Busy's debut full length album (and he produces it) it is well impressive. The best tune is definitely That Bad. That Bad is an ultra-clever ode to the rest of the dancehall (and even some out of the dancehall) taking lines from nearly everyone from Kartel to Killa; and from Kalonji to the Fugees! The song is somewhat along the lines of Kartel's Robbery and Kiprich's Baby Song, just well done, and arguably better than either tune.Also check the combinations: The Bounty Killa combination, Do The Maths (interesting Kartel and Killa had a combination called Maths Automatic) is exactly what you would expect, the knock you over the head militaristic style showdown. Check the second single Not Going Down which is a tune with a message described as a straight jump up dancehall record. Busy even comes armed with 'his own' Wayne Marshall who Kartel came up with, in Movado with whom has 2 combinations with on Step Out, (same as Kartel's debut Up 2 di Time) the best of which being Full Clip.The similarities may end there between the two artists however, as Busy has a complete other more 'experimental' side. He has a tune here named Love Me Not which is about as vulnerable as you would ever want to see anyone on a tune (but the tune quickly grows on you I assure you!) which features Reanno Gordon (aka Busy Signal) as he goes Wayne Wonder and Red Rat by creating the alternative identity on the nice tune. My second favorite tune here is actually I Love Yuh which features the Angelic Alaine, on just a wonderful tune which could spin on US radio right now, I'm sure! The second half of the album actually goes in many different softer directions, he has another nice combination with Kris Kelly, since you been away, and an interlude which features him just calling his daughter. The album even ends with Pon di Pole, a PURE SOCA song!While I made a point of drawing a few curious similarities between Kartel and Busy Signal (the seemingly wild headed Idonia has very little in common with the 'Sassin) rest assured this is no carbon act. Busy Signal's debut Step Out marks the arrival of a significant new talent in the dancehall. And while it will take you over mountains and pretty much everywhere else (including 3 videos) at the end, you just might be on the groundfloor of something really special if you pick this one up.

A few years ago you couldn't go around to too many of the strictly reggae market sites and not read and be made aware of the name Batch. The Bobo from St Croix was absolutely taking a stranglehold on underground reggae with his debut album, Who You Are in 2003. The album received critical acclaimed (from the few who reviewed it) and I remember it actually making the tops of some 'Best of' year end lists as well. At the time, however, the album didn't register on my radars (I was probably more interested in some of the Sizzla albums, or Jah Mason or Turbulence) for some reason.But I made a mistake.Since then, I have picked up one of Batch's later albums, his most recent album, Jah Guidance. I wasn't exactly blown away with JG (although the riddims were spectcular) so I even further delayed picking up Who You Are. It wasn't until last weekend when I saw the album in a store where I picked it up. And the 3 year delay I put on Who You Are was to no one's detriment but my own, the album is wicked!Batch, responsible for all of his verses, all melodies and all riddims on the album, did a wonderful job in putting together one of the finest reggae debuts that I have ever heard and finally I see why everyone was making such a big fuss over the artist. I also see why he stays in demand and tours the states regularly. All the vibes are top notch roots and he lines up some unknown, but still dynamic combinations as well.My favourite track on Who You Are is without a doubt Ah Rulah! Ah Rulah is a really really fine biggup to all Black Woman, as he says, "Black Woman yuh a rulah! Don't mek no european come fool yuh!" Its a nice nice tune over a very laid back and almost ethereal vibes of a riddim, and easily one of the best modern Black Woman tunes I've heard.Also check the fine Selassie Way! Myself being a rather large fan of Sizzla Kalonji's I liken it alot to One Away with a mighty powerful vibe. The song fills up quickly into a large vibrant vibe with a nice female backing singer. Also check, the other big tune which was recommended on this album (I dont think OFFICIALLY it had any 'single'), Jah Guide I, I would have loved to hear that on the album, Jah Guidance, really big tune.All three of the combinations are very impressive with the first, Victorious with the unknown (to me) Ras L. & Nazarite, being a very very nice song praising Jah and speaking of the ills of society. Check the hard almost dancehall-like Fi Burn with seemingly Dynamic Duo Masta Chang and Sheperd, easily the hardest sounding vibe on the album, and an excellent mix of the vibes where Batch shows his versatility and turns almost Luciano style singer. And lastly, check Free with singer Ambassador and Batch right hand man the well powerful Ras Attitude.Also check solo pieces Level the Vibes, which is the closer but actually the first song that I heard on the album and is a well might tune from Batch alone; Check the actual opener Lift Up which has somewhat of an old school vibes but a message of any era as he warns the massive to "Lift up your consciousness!"; and definitely check the obligatory herbsman tune, Green Gold, which of course deals with you know what! Oh and I have to mention one of the best tunes on the album, Chant Dem Down! Love that song!Overall, this is probably one of the hardest to find gems in all of modern reggae at this point. There were actually rumors of a reprinting last year which apparently didnt materialize and even when it was brand new it was quite difficult to find. But should you tap into that same online marketplace which made it Who You Are so massive a few years back you may be able to locate a copy. The album was definitely well worth it and just a complete joy of reggae music to listen to.

2 of my most appreciated vibes in all of music: 1 is the seemingly forgotten wickedness of Beenie Man spar Silvercat who was one of the first dj's to prove that he coudl actually make a point and yell at you at the top of his lungs at the same time, forgotten because of his fondness of travelling but not recording these days. The second being the absolutely diving Marion Hall (Lady Saw) over ANY pure dancehall riddim 1994-1997. Lady Saw had a way of just gripping her claws and sticking to any riddim from that era which she rode, and while she never really (and still hasn't) got it to work on a complete album to the perfect level (at least partly do to her love of the odd country ballad her and there) prime and vintage Lady Saw is about as good as any artist from any period of the dancehall.Saw definitely had a bubbling to her at that which maybe only a few, if any really, have ever had, each tune was easy listening although she would always say something, be it sexual or relationship-wise, that would make you think, but all of the tunes were danceable and not just because 'bubbly' could firmly describe that period in dancehall riddims, many other artists were riding the same productions but not getting the effect and probably besides Beenie Man, no other artist could literally pack a dancefloor in JA better than Saw.Released way back in 1996, a decade ago (am I really getting that old!) Give Me the Reason was just Saw's second full length studio album (and what a shame she's only released 3 since) and it was a very very solid album, probably not as spectacular as her debut Lover Girl, but still a fine fine effort.The best song here without a doubt is What is Slackness? A prime example of Saw's talent in the era and a denouncement of the sickly amount of she was receiving at that point in her career for recording slack tunes similar to what her male peers were recording and receiving virtually no criticism at all.Also check Good Wuk which is probably the biggest hit on the album. Good Wuk was more of a typicla dancehall tune over a Shocking Vibes riddim and at a much faster pace. Check the clever Darnest Thing and Husband a Mine both 2 really 2 fine tunes for Saw. Also check both Condom and the cool message on Love & Understanding which ranges in that fine fine old school dancehall vibe.Then you have 2 really big tunes for different reason. First is the now infamous Life Without Dick, which is sung as if 'Dick' is her actual man and not. . . something else (as she says, 'lef up to your imagination). The song is shocking and after laughing for a good while you will thoroughly enjoy the story style of the tune. Then there's the second best tune her Name Nuh Stand fi Sex. The song is not too dissimilar to What is Slackness in that it displays an excellent message and at the same time gets the heads rocking back and forth and the hips gridning, just wonderfully done and while there are without a doubt more powerful lyricists out there, NO ONE in the dance could do Lady Saw's songs besides Lady Saw herself.Overall, I equate this album similar to Vybz Kartel's sophomore (actually it is Kartel holding the candle to the far more veteran artist Saw) album JMT. Both their firsts were much more typical to the artist and in the second they showed they can actually vibe off of something that wasn't, in Saw's case, sex, typical to them as an artist. In the decade since, Saw has proven herself to be quietly quite versatile in the dance and if he is ever so lucky Kartel can do half the work Saw has done. Good album from one of dancehall's finest.

The Good Ways album is perhaps eternally to be overlooked, largely due to the presence of its rather legendary definitive predecessor. This album is sometimes referred to as the 2nd batch of tunes in a week long session from early 1997 between producer Bobby Digital and his team and Sizzla Kalonji.The Black Woman and Child album took the majority of the best material from that session however, Good Ways, being not his best is still classic classic material. Being a heavier vibe than the laid back BW&C; album, you can definitely see why the two were separated the way they were, Good Ways is much more of a dancehall oriented album, with much more of a mean edge to it. Not to say there isn't any roots here, because there is as well.Its hard to say exactly what the best tune here because from the top few songs they're very very close in quality. But if pressed I'd probably go with the old school chant on Bless Me. But tunes like Good Ways, Aznaldo (probably the biggest hit here) and the firefilled Anytime Now have all withstood the test of time to hold up as some of Sizzla's finest work ever.Also have to check the really huge Suffer if They Don't Hear which is followed by Half that Has Never Been Told. Both the tunes make up the smaller softer side of Good Ways and both would have fit just finely on the Black Woman and Child album.From the nearing 40 studio album catalog that Sizzla has amassed in his decade of recording, Good Ways is the only album that can claim to have been released on 3 different occasions. Originally released in '98 by VP, then again the following year by the now defunct Artist's Only, in 2003 again by VP. This album was huge and everyone who heard it, knew it!Overall, it is albums like Good Ways and others such as Bobo Ashanti, Royal Son of Ethiopia and Freedom Cry which helped established Sizzla Kalonji as one of the most dominant forces in roots reggae. They help to show that even when he doesn't attain such heights as on his best material in Black Woman and Child, Praise Ye Jah and Da Real Thing, even his second level material is better than most. Good Ways is on that same level, mandatory for any Sizzla fan.

I purchased the Euro version of this album, which means that I got it about 2 months before it was released in the US. I gave it a cursory listen before it fell out of my cd player in favour of a ton of other stuff (including another Anthony B album, Black Star) and wasn't too impressed. I got it, largely based on the artist of course, and the label. The people from Spain (via Germany) Minor7Flat5 have a great history of doing fantastic reggae music, including a nice album from Turbulence, Different Thing and Lutan Fyah's official debut, Dem No Know Demself.It took me about another 2 months to pick My Hope back up, when someone asked me if I knew about another Anthony B album coming out (coming fresh off the release of 2 more since Black Star) and they were talking about My Hope. And all i can say is. . .I'm sorry.My Hope is Anthony B.'s best studio album of 2005, and the previous 2 were very fine efforts indeed. It is a completely polished gem of an album, and were it not for another 'recent' M7F5 release (which I believe is released in the US shortly) it would be the finest release the label has ever made, which is saying a lot on both fronts. From the players used and quite possibly the best usage of background singers I've heard on a studio album in a long time, Anthony B is at his TOP form throughout My Hope.The best tune is definitely the beautifull simple title track. The tune is made to be inspirational, but the lush one-drop backing will have your head rocking almost from the first second, and Pam Hall on the backing vocals makes it seem bigger than it really is.Another highlight of My Hope is the nice combinations (a mark of M7F5 albums). Although 4 is getting close to being too many, every combination on the album is well done and makes it a better record because of its presence. Wonderful (and criminally underrated) singer Mark Wonder guests on Don't Cry, might be my second favourite tune on the album (if not that, then definitely Watch Over My Head). Large voiced chanter Taffari guests on Rise Up, wonderful tune and the commercial highlight of course being Face Off the wicked combination with German reggae king Gentleman.Other highlights include the closer Rastaman She Want, which rides the beautiful Altafaan produced Tsahai riddim (best known for being the back of recent Junior Kelly hit Receive), Strong Shoulder and ganja anthem More Pon More. And if I didn't mention a particular tune, rest assured the tune is a big tune still, there is no bad music on My Hope.Overall, I'll definitely reccomend this one, and I dont think I'm making it seem better than it is (which i tend to do), My Hope is a big album, and a lot of reggae fans will probably miss out on it (as Anthony B has been doing a lot of work lately), its his best complete work of 2005, and one of the best complete works of 2005 period!

I bought X the day it came out and I have not enjoyed it that much. I give it 3 stars because of the vocals. There just isn't one memorable song on the record. Nothing stands out, nothing makes you remember how it goes. Their first two records were fantastic, must haves, but X, X is just. . . its just there.

This might be the best dancehall record of the year so far. Foxy blows it up here. The way she drifts in and out of rapping and djaying is very impressive. Foxy did a guest spot on Spragga Benz's last record and it was very good as well, and I'm glad she has fully incorporated that style into her own music because in my opinion she djays much better than she raps. Best song is Oh Yeah with Spragga, Run Dem and Tables Will Turn both Baby Cham and of course if Cham is on the album then Dave Kelly is producing them Madhouse beats on both cuts. Wayne Wonder also shows up on his own Saddest Day. And check out Na Na Be Like. On the hip-hop side check 730 because gyal got issues. Move over Lady Saw, someone is challenging that throne queen.

There can be made a very strong case that Royal Son of Ethiopia is Sizzla's absolute best album ever. It is without a doubt, lyrically, one of his best, and I really like the fact that Greensleeves decided to put the lyrics to all of the songs in the liner notes, seeing them in writing actually somewhat helps the entire experience somewhat. Favorite tracks absolutely &quot;Eastern Mountain&quot;, &quot;In This Time&quot; with Luciano, &quot;Burn Dem Turf&quot; and &quot;Mental Chains&quot;. The absolute best song being without a doubt &quot;As In the Beginning&quot; which besides &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;Praise Ye Jah&quot; is my favorite Kalonji song ever. Overall, this album is amazing, no weak points, no weak tracks of course(they don't exist on Xterminator) and just an exellent album.

Up 2 Di Time might be the finest dancehall album I've heard this year altogether. While it boasts songs that I am tired of and no to the letter, there are no truly bad songs, and the new stuff is serious.Kartel, probably the best young talent out of Jamaican right now, boasts some seriously odd flows, he's on a scale that might be unchallenged in DANCEHALL right now (i think Kalonji might have something to say about that in all of reggae music)and it does not stop here. The best song here is Sen On, an older song that I've loved since the first listen, also really love Robbery which is hilarious! Kartel &amp; Kardinal with Canada's leading MC Kardinal Offishal, Start Well is madness as is Badman Nah and AKA (really mad on AKA).Overall, I've been waiting on this cd for a long time, its been delayed and delayed again, and delayed a week after being finalized, but it was worth the wait and for the wait, Greensleeves threw in a 13 minute freestyle album with Kartel and Ward 21's front man (a lot of Nuh Climb in the freestyle album). And dancehall doesn't get much finer than this, some people have different point of views of things, and Kartel is one of those people, Up 2 Di Time is golden.

A rather unsurprising set of circumstances led to the success of one of the most 'unusual' big riddims of '05. One of the biggest being that the 'it' thing of riddims in 2005 was reincarnation. Many riddims thought long forgotten were given new life, perhaps the most might of all being the World a Music.As of right now, the World Jam riddim is easily best known as the riddim of Damian Marley's hit song, Welcome to Jamrock. However, the riddim had already made its rounds; going from big producer to big producer before landing on the Marley's doorstep (and the Marley's took production credit for it, they did use a slightly souped up version of it). It was originally a Taxi Gang riddim used for Ini Kamoze's hit World a Music, and also for Jammy's Boom Shakalak for Jr. Reid. It ended up in the UK where French producer, the aptly named Frenchie set to work on it.Frenchie did nothing but change the levels and record with different session players. The result is a ever so slightly sped up and less 'dubbish' carbon copy of the original. Shockingly, the dancehall littered Greensleeves Records of the UK decided to pick up the riddim, making it #73 in their Rhythm Album series, making it also the first roots riddim of the entire series in a year where roots reggae basically upended the dancehall and took over in JA.The only basic 'problem' with the riddim is that due perhaps mostly to its popularity and less so to its tempo, it's terribly easy to ride, (I'd have no hard time imagining that some of the 20-30 something's on the album grew up rhyming over the World a Music and undoubtedly after its rebirth) which lends to a few easy going performances. But the overall album is quite satisfactory, especially when noticing the varied mix of artists voicing on it. Frenchie's rather odd selection of artists is easily one of the highlights here, with many of the usual suspects to some of the "how in the world is he on here" types as well.Probably the best tune of them all the cut out basic riddim, played by the legendary Firehouse Crew. It is easily one of the coolest laid back riddims JA has ever produced, it doesn't vary itself at all and is very straight forward, but that is the beauty of the riddim. The best artist track is probably Anthony B, with whom the producer was apparently so impressed that he also produced a complete album for (GS's Black Star) the artist, B's World a Reggae Music is wonderful and has received excellent support.Bounty Killer and Luciano alo score well here on Poor People and A No Like Wi No Like Them respectively, also Beenie Man on From Jamaica and Chuck Fenda on the impressive Jah Nah Sleep. That's where things get a little odd. Frenchie raided half of the old Main Street crew as both General Degree (on the nice Must Run Away) and Red Rat (on the average Ghetto Youths Fi Rich) voice the World Jam (hate to pigeonhole the Rat but he need not step away from the typical craziness where he does his best). Also voicing are Ward 21 who goes slack in an old school stylee on Worldwide Connection, resurrecting Nicodemus at the same time as the riddim and Vybz Kartel who 'shuns' the slackness and goes flat out violent on How We Ride, but his flow is nevertheless impressive (and reminiscent of the one on his combination with Sizzla).Later in the piece the UK's very own impressive DJ Chukki Starr keeps his excellent Hard Fi Smile on the top shelf, being perhaps the second best lyric on the riddim overall, very nice from the artist who Greensleeves would be wise to sign up, right in their own backyard.Overall, despite the riddim's popularity, this isn't one for the reggae novice. You can ONLY appreciate this one if you truly love your roots. The World Jam changes not one time throughout the 18 tracks besides the artist's interpretations and backup singers (which I only remember on the final track, In the Street by Baby G). One of the best qualities of this riddim is that on every track the Taxi Gang is given writer's credits, which is becoming a source of controversy with all the redoing of riddim's, Frenchie definitely got it right. If you truly love reggae music, you'll get it right by picking up the World Jam.

The absolute worse part about this album is Jazzy T being annoying on every track trying to introduce the songs, its really really terrible that Jamdown records lets him do that, because he seemingly ruins pretty good complete albums. (Dancehall Xplosion 2001 as well)That, coupled with the fact that Jamdown recycles so many songs on their albums (i.e. Vegas' Sway on at least 3 different albums)has lead me to declare that this album will be the first and only JAMDOWN production I purchase this year.Getting to this album, which despite Jazzy T, isn't that bad. However, I have to say that the song Ganja Baby by Monster Shack is one of the worst ever: it plays right off of Jay-Z's "Give it To Me" which is not what a true dancehall artist should be doing. Also, Best of the Best by unknown artist Nesbeth is pretty hard on the ears as well: As are Don't Lie to Me and Where Did My Baby Go by unknown Me Patchie and Vegas respectively. Elephant Man, who is almost on every dancehall compilation released these days unfortunately (not that I don't like EM, but enough is enough) has 3 tracks on the album, the best of which being Draw Wi Out. The good points here are of course Sean Paul on Dem A Fraud, T.O.K. on an unspectacular but decent Same Team and of course Kalonji adding a bit of class to this needing album with Trample. But the absolute best is the return of the ancient monarchy Frisco Kid, coming with the new Rasta lyrics. Fishtail, the weaker of his two tracks is very very good, but Go Se Dung is flat out Kalonji-level amazing, the flows are ridiculous there. Overall, I say only get this one, if you haven't bought a compilation album in a really long time; maybe if you're new to dancehall music and need kind of an entry level to start on, or if, like me you buy anything with Sizzla and Sean Paul on it, and Friso Kid and Red Rat to boot.

Its nearing just about 11 years ago which Rock the World from one reggae's finest roots chanters, Determine was released. The album, Determine's debut, was released way back in 1996 and almost immediately assumed a sort of atypical cult like following in Jamaica as Determine had made a name for himself as being by far one of the wickedest studio and session dj's in all of Jamaica. However, despite the backing of reggae giant label VP and legendary producer Bobby Digital working the boards for the entire project, it wasn't very well distributed nor promoted virtually at all.Rock the World has become one of the hardest to find album gems in all of Jamaica, joining the likes of Sizzla's Praise Ye Jah (just in terms of availability, not in terms of QUALITY), Beenie Man's 10 Year Old DJ Wonder and Norrisman's Persistence. So imagine my surprise when I found the complete set (cassette, vinyl & cd) in a small store in St. Maarten (and of course I bought all three!).Determine originally came to fame courtesy of creating a massive following through his studio sessions with such producers as the aformentioned Bobby Digital, Star Trail, Fi Wi and Star Trail. Determine has without a doubt one of the wickedest flows even now, that you'll find anywhere in reggae, thus, over the years despite never reaching the top status of his peers such as Sizzla, Capleton or Anthony B, he has proven to be one of the most durable lyricists in all of reggae. He received his big break and became a household name here in 1995 when was featured on the well powerful combination Kette Drum with dancehall King Beenie Man. The song has since become a virtual legendary track which is still Determine's biggest to date and one of professional hit maker Beenie's largest as well.The track, produced by Bobby Digital led to the producer subsequently taking Determine under his wing for a period and produding both of Determine's album's (he also produced, with his son, the MASSIVE Mi Lord combination, which was arguably better than Kette Drum with Sizzla Kalonji, from the Digital produced seminal classic Black Woman & Child album) to date, Rock the World and followup, the well powerful Freedom Chant of 1999.Rock the World is actually a stronger chant than the slightly longer Freedom Chant and it, expectedly, more of an old school dancehall feel to it. The Annotto Bay native crafts a wicked dynamo of an album and drops a piece which can be played from beginning to end without skipping a track or a beat.The best track here is still without a doubt Kette Drum. I remember when the tune first dropped, it was a deviation from the typical GIRLS, SEX & GIRLS style which Beenie Man was in teh process of developing for himself and it was the mark of the arrival of another supertalent to roots reggae in Determine. The song is a very unusual combination just on who is involved, but the pair work a complete masterclass together with Digital on the boards providing the beautiful nyah backed Kette Drum riddim.Apparently attempting to capatilize on the strength of the track, also present and worth checking is the nice nice (uncredited) combination Beat the Kette Drum with classic singer Frankie Paul. The song is also based over another wonderful and more full nyah drum influenced riddim and although its not as powerful as Kette Drum, the combination still works finely!When set on his own merits Determine certainly doesn't flop as most of the elite work on Rock the World is the solo material. Check the Bobo Ashanti affirmation which is Broom Broom. Broom is an ultra-clever and well mighty explanation of the Bobo Dreads and the proclivity of carrying the broom as both a spiritual sign of literal and mental cleanliness and hygiene, and its also a TOTAL Rasta unification tune as well. Check the anti-abortion Baby Killer which is one of the tunes here I remember getting a decent spin on radio stations here when it first dropped before the album.Also check the nice dancehall effort Shaka Zulu which shows Determine's overall versatility as he has no problems slightly adjusting his style to fit in the dancehall, all the while 'sneaking' onne of the most powerful cultural tracks on Rock the World altogether! Shaka Zulu is mighty mighty! The title track here is also a worth many listens. Rock the World, both the track and the album are basically an affirmation that Determine was on the scene to stay and as he says, Jah sent he (and Digital) to "Shock the world and rock the world!".Lastly, a few other tracks worth checking, definitely Don't Remember Love (not to be confused with Nuh Member Love, the strongest track from the Freedom Chant album) which is Determine's powerful commentary on the then (and probably now as well) state of Jamaica and the dancehall. Check Birds and the Bees, another powerful roots track in a dancehall track's clothing which is probably the most potent example of Determine's actual flowing ability as he float's over the strong drum heavy Digital B piece.Overall, I'm somewhat reserved in recommending Rock the World, simply because of just how difficult to find it actually is. So I'll tell you not to hold your breath! But definitely pick this one up should you encounter it. All these years later and we're still wondering just who sold their soul to the devil to prevent the TRULY wicked Determine from being a bigger star. One of the original Bobo Ashanti chanters on the scene who showed a level of craftsmanship and versatility which has withstood the test of the time! Determine is a big big artist and definitely check out Rock the World, one of the best roots pieces of that time.

You have artists that come around not so very infrequently who just tend to surprise me through one way or another musically. There are artists who can surprise strictly based on them being themselves, meaning something about the way they make music ALL THE TIME, is just so unique that it definitely catches my attention. Such was the case Jah Cure. Jah Cure has by far one of the most ridiculously attention grabbing voices that I've ever heard in the scope of not only reggae, but any form of music as well. Similarly, there is Chezidek, who, although there have been times when I have just been tired of hearing his voice, definitely sets himself apart from the leagues and leagues of roots singers simply by opening his mouth and delivering his Martian-high vocals. In the dancehall: The past few years we've seen artists emerge such as Aidonia who has taken what Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer, Mad Cobra and Mad Cobra have done over the years in establishing themselves and taken the art of gun-busting and ruthlessly violent dancehall to a level of virtual hilarity. The same could definitely be said for singer Mavado, who seemingly remains completely in the dark (and I do mean COMPLETELY) when it comes to making strong material which doesn't include talk of the gun and/or death. They all have made themselves relevant and continue to remain so in the ultra competitive reggae landscape, due largely to the fact that in their natural state, the way they make music is just so unusual and attractive. Just a few years back we saw the emergence of Vybz Kartel who had seemingly taken just about every Bounty Killer album you had ever heard, splashed in just about every Beenie Man album you could have ever heard and added a dash of Madd Anju (or Roundhead, as I've recently heard some saying, although I disagree) in developing a style which showed the downright odd lyrics machine in the best possible light. Just a few years later and there can be no talk of dancehall hierarchy without the name Vybz Kartel coming very close to the top (if not at the absolute top, particularly in some areas). The challenge for these unusual artists is almost always introducing themselves to the public in a way which doesn't necessarily make their vibes feel overbearing (which is a problem I believe Chezidek is suffering from) and literally give the masses time to be accustomed to their voice, personality or style. However, a TRULY unusual thing occurs when an artist emerges who has a voice, a personality AND a style which are ALL completely different from something that people have heard before.Enter Dez-I Boyd. I've seen artists like Boyd before over three or four names but never in just one solo artist at all. The Manchester native has impressed me from the very first tune I heard from him and even when I have heard a song from Boyd which didn't exactly vibe with me, I still managed to remember the vibes of the tune definitely. At his best, Dez-I Boyd is an artist who obviously comes from the same school of vibes as the criminally underrated and overlooked Professor Nuts. Easily one of the most talented minds the dancehall has been fortunate enough to receive, Professor Nuts had a BRUTALLY clever style which allowed (and continues to allow him) to talk about any topic at any time in any song and on any riddim with any vibes as he always manages to make tunes which are interlocked in a brilliant story telling style which is his own personal style, Dez-I Boyd (and I'm not placing him in terms of status alongside Professor Nuts just yet) does the same in his own way (I would also mention young and VERY inactive dancehall artist Regan who employs a similar level of creativity whenever he manages to find his way to the studio). Boyd's personality also is unique. At his base he is a roots artist without a doubt. However, he FAR AND AWAY excels more at the bouncier more dancehall oriented tracks for the most part, even within a rootical scope of vibes. It is quite often that I'll see and hear a dancehall artist who would seemingly have a better ear for the roots side (see Assassin; see Baby Cham over the last three years); but it is very rare indeed that I'll hear an artist who is a strictly rootical artist and think that they might actually belong in the dancehall. By no way am I saying that Dez-I Boyd needs to go anywhere near a Stephen McGregor riddim; but an old school style of dancehall pacing might be something he might look at in the future to expand his vibes definitely and it would also certainly bring him to a more popular stage as well (speaking of stages, having seen the artist perform once, he definitely carries his vibes well to the stage show as well) as he seems much more at home bouncing that on a one-drop. Vocally speaking, Dez-I's voice is one which is a big melting pot of things. Its interesting that on one of the two best tunes here (more on that in a bit) my wife absolutely loves the song, but at the same time, doesn't like his voice at all. For me, I would say, again, its more of the type of thing you would hear from a dancehall artist hanging on a rootical vibes. In there are similarities to styles like Norrisman, a bit of Nasio, and ESPECIALLY Chuck Fenda. The result (at least in my opinion) is a more laid back, more settled version of Chuck Fenda and one who isn't afraid to just stop everything and attempt a singing style (much like Fenda himself actually). Having spent the last year thoroughly enjoying a few releases from the different vibes of Dez-I Boyd, I was quite happy to see that he had VERY quietly managed to release a full length album for his home base label New Creation Records based in Atlanta, Georgia in the States (which is where I believe he actually calls home now at least part time), the solid Thanks For Life. The album not only reminds me why I began to take a closer look at the artist in the first place, but places a new line of vibes to go along with his name.My attraction to Boyd, and thus his album, was largely built on the strength of two very different songs and the first question is answered when you see that both of his big singles from the last year are present on the album (how many times have you seen the big song, especially in reggae, get left away from the album???). The album gets started with what amounts to the title track here, Give Thanks. Give Thanks (For Life) is very strong and it somewhat adds to what I was saying about his style. Its so unconventional that a standard style of one-drop riddim doesn't exactly seem to fit his vibes, THANKFULLY Give Thanks is far from that. The riddim is a finely crafted one-drop which has a dancehall feel to it (thanks to the weaving bass sound present throughout the tune). For his part, Boyd, while far from his most jovial keeps his vibes high (albeit a bit clich&eacute;) but id aided with what is definitely the strongest melodies and choruses on the album altogether. A truly strong way to begin a debut album. The second tune here is one of the two heavyweights, Shake Up Yuh Natty. The song conveys a message which I have LONG noticed and been downright puzzled by at times. Take a trip to any of Jamaica's most popular dancehall's or niteclubs and you'll notice something which seems fun for sometimes, but definitely all the time. Dancers dance crazy choreographed and stylized and just high-tech dances which sometimes just FLAT OUT IGNORE the women. As Dez-I so wonderfully puts it , "Men are signaling the plane, they have no time fi bubble pon Elaine. They have no eyes for ladies! They are calling down the rain!", distinctly mentioning two of the most popular dances over the past decade, and the song is the TRUTH. The song itself is a dancehall tune and certainly one which could (and has, I've heard it play a few times in dances now) specifically encourage man and woman interaction in the dance and is just one of the most clever and well put together dancehall tunes I have EVER heard. Boyd is joined on the tune by his far more conventional label mate Jah Phil (who remembers Jah Phil on the True Reflections riddim with Be Strong?) who definitely adds his own spice to the already VERY spicy song. Shake Up Yuh Natty rather easily makes my choice for Thanks For Life's second best tune overall. Completing the opening for the album is another very unique piece, Economic Revolution. Coming on an almost Garnet Silk like vibes is Boyd on the ultra bouncy rootical effort which is a song which full on displays everything which is NICE about the artist. I don't know if any roots artist in the game could make a song like Economic Revolution (although I wouldn't mind if Junior Kelly gave it a shot) which is a song which speaks to woman in society assuming roles which are historically more associated with males, while some men, likewise, assume more traditionally feminine roles. Again, very very unique and well thought subject matter on the tune.The second of the two REALLY big tunes here which I knew before I got my hands on the album is also here and ranks as my favourite tune on the Thanks For Life altogether. Essence is a tune which every rootical artist needs to have in his/her bag of tricks, it is the obligatory herbalist tune. Of course, it is the herbalist tune given Boyd's own different spin and it almost plays as a laid back bouncy r&b; style of vibes, but the song is really SPECTACULAR. Essence is the kind of story-telling style of vibes which I was speaking of earlier and its really a song which could appeal to roots and dancehall heads alike. In the song, Boyd rather matter-of-factly relays a story of being stopped by patrol and searched for ganja. Upon finding none on the artist, as Boyd hilariously puts it, "The officer stopped and looked at me and said `Next time, please bring a draw for me'". Just a very clever track and one which is of course unique to this album, you'll find it nowhere else. Big big tune! The best of the rest is probably a more traditional track, one which powers Boyd's simple rootical side, the very fine Deep Meditation. While Boyd sounds NOTHING like him, Deep Meditation in vibes and in lyrics sounds more like something you would expect from the Messenjah, Luciano (or maybe even Garnet Silk, whom I would be absolutely SHOCKED if the fellow Manchester native Boyd didn't list as an inspiration). I'm also quite high on Real People which is a Jah Phil production (which sounds VERY familiar for some reason; it sounds a bit like the stress riddim from Calibud, minus the heavy horns) . The tune is another more straight forwarded rootical effort from Boyd proving that although it isn't really his forte, with his vibes and his lyrical ability he can do just about anything he wants to musically. I'd also recommend the even more dancehall forward Wife Material which is PURE story-telling top notch. The riddim itself is hardcore, but smooth simultaneously and I'd challenge any of Boyd's far more hardcore peers to take a better turn on the riddim than Boyd as he wonderful crafts a story about a woman who is far much more than a good time girl, but potential wife material. It is a very strong inclusion here.Largely due to his style, Boyd is somewhat prone to make tracks that are just downright WEIRD and while it doesn't happen much in the course of Thanks For Life's twelve tracks, it does occur. Most glaringly check ICU. I really don't know what's going on with ICU outside of the message (which is very strong and almost insanely CLEVER playing both on ICU as I See You and ICU as Intensive Care Unit). The song is built over some. . . Heavy metal apocalyptic style riddim which really takes the attention from the message and just leaves you wondering what happen. Less glaringly check the album's closer Friday which finds a Boyd looking forward to Friday so he can have more time with his special lady. The song is almost annoyingly simple and someone as talented as Boyd could definitely do better. . . But I do have to admit its starting to grown on me a bit.Overall, speaking more largely on Boyd as a whole, he really has big things in his future to my ears. He is very active in Jamaica locally, working with several charities and laying the foundation for what is potentially a very big career. There isn't really an `odd man out' or a `different guy' in the roots side (I think, for whatever it's worth, Kartel still occupies the role in the dancehall) and what a perfect candidate for the position is Dez-I Boyd. Dez-I's style also (in my opinion) gives him somewhat of a mainstream crossover potential as well. I'm definitely not saying that the roots has found its version of Sean Paul at all, but someday I wouldn't be at all shocked to see a tune like Shake Up Yuh Natty playing on American stations and worldwide as well. Thanks For Life, Boyd's debut album is a strong international introduction to one of the most unique talents to emerge in Jamaica in recent years.

How times have changed! Just a few years ago I felt as if though I were one of the very few fan championing the cause of the unknown Natural Black. The chanter, born Mortimer Softley in Georgetown, Guyana, was toiling in what amounted to obscurity (even by Jamaican standards) while being widely regarded by most industry veterans (most notably by the legendary Beres Hammond) and hardcore roots reggae fans as one of the most talented artists holding the mic in Jamaica overall at the time. Natural Black did make it on some levels, working with some of the biggest names (again, most notably Hammond) and on the biggest stages in Jamaica (Sting, Rebel Salute) but had yet to break through with that big hit and despite releasing 2 albums had yet to gain a critical acclaim necessary push to take his career to the next level. Things started to look brighter for the chanter in 2004 when he voiced the excellent Let the Good Times Roll combination with mentor Beres Hammond for Hammond's Love Has No Boundaries album, besides being one of the very first times the international audience would have a taste of Natural Black's vibes, it was a very very good song and showed a bit of his versatility. Then the following year the bomb would drop in the form of the MASSIVE Seasons riddim by dancehall ace turned roots extraordinaire, Vendetta. Over the riddim Black voiced his now timeless Far From Reality which proved to be his first Jamaican number one song and made him ever more in demand than before. The song was one of the finest in an outstanding stable of songs recorded by one of the most popular roots riddims of recent times (I'm still well in the middle of which riddim I prefer, the Seasons or the Drop Lead. . . Yeah the Heavenly was solid too!) which also included Alaine's majestic No Ordinary Love and Jah Cure's epochal Love Is. It also made him much in demand by the big reggae record companies as well before UK giant Greensleeves signed Natural Black up and released Far From Reality the album in 2006.Far From Reality, his third release, was an absolute success. For his part, Black pushed forth some of the best material of his career on the album and tracks such as (the MASSIVE) Beautiful Place and other tracks which didn't receive the big video light treatment such as Think Big and Hard Ears, greatly complimented the bigger tracks, such as the title track and Never Hurt You. The album also did commercially well, which for Greensleeves the label may have been a shock (although probably not due to their recent shift in direction) as despite marginal promotion (and even that is getting better from the label now) it still did well and of course armed with a title track stuck on the tips of the tongues of reggae heads the world over, one would hope such an album could succeed. Far From Reality also continued the slide in the positive for Greensleeves releasing such surprising and find albums such as Fanton Mojah's Hail the King; Lutan Fyah's awesome Phantom War; Norrisman's solid Home & Away (and you check out Norrisman's fine new release Captura as well, and Jah Mason's excellent Wheat & Tears (which is currently being slept on as we speak!). The album was well received as well, Natural Black made a great impression on the masses and completed his arrival (only about 3-4 years later than he should have, but the man, SERIOUSLY paid his dues) at the top notch, reggae elite.Comparatively, Natural Black had even shown flashes of being able to deliver such a project much earlier in his career. His first album, World War from Lion Roots in 2001 (which was apparently just re-released this year) was the perfect introduction to Natural Black. The album was one of the strongest debuts you'll hear in reggae within the last decade or so and with songs like Me Do Me Best and the Hindi vibes on Chiguen, World War proved to be also one of the wildest roots albums you'll hear. His sophomore release, Spiritual Food, from Patate Records in 2003 showed Black in pretty much the same form you see him in today. That album was a sleekly produced monster and garnered him a small, but hardcore following armed with the then two biggest hits of his career, To My Bonafide and Songs With Feelings (both of which, however, were absolutely smashed when one came across the WICKED Calibud produced Free Again, still to this day my absolute favorite Natural Black track). I often point to Natural Black as having a nearly story book career, when learning of his coming to Jamaica in 1995 as a Rastafarian with little more than the clothes on his back, determined to become a reggae singer. Natural Black birthed a style which was part Buju Banton, part Sizzla and part Jah Cure (in retrospect I'll actually call him a hyped up version of Trini chanter Marlon Asher). His style is that of DJ or chanter, yet almost always being melodic, which is rare, he sounds nothing similar, but somewhat reminds of the old dancehall DJ days whenmelodies where more important over minimalist riddims. He also, on occasion, in a very Sizzla like manner, tends to lose his calm and absolutely explode without any given notice (he`ll also, much like Asher, occasionally break down as a full singer as well).Speaking of short notice, that is exactly how his latest release, the subtly brilliant Jah Guide comes to us. Released far less than a year after its figurative predecessor Far From Reality, and just over one month after its literal predecessor, Vizion Sounds' Cool Nuh Black (that label is entirely too close to Batch's Sound Vizion's label, they should really COMBINE those vibes!), Jah Guide comes somewhat unexpectedly and with not as much pre-promotion as last year's Far From Reality, however, it comes armed with just as interesting a story. Last year, Sizzla Kalonji released the quietly excellent Waterhouse Redemption which saw the popular Bobo chanter combining with legendary dancehall ace producer King Jammy. Greensleeves, an annual participant in the Sizzla album circuit, gobbled up the songs and released it and it became one of Sizzla's more highly regarded pieces recent (and far and away the best album from Sizzla in 2006) as it introduced the legendary chanter over Jammy's bottomless vault of old school dancehall and roots riddims. Jah Guide finds Greensleeves taking its new star the same route as a Jammy's production and a very very solid album. Much like Waterhouse Redemption, Jah Guide's vibes take awhile to truly take affect on you (took me all of about a day of straight listening, the first album I listened to like that since the Ghetto Whiskey riddim album), because the clashing of the styles almost, and Natural Black's style if very modern roots.I'm almost confused in picking my favorite tune on the album as several identify themselves as outstanding during the 15 track course of Jah Guide (which takes a downward turn in terms of the cover when compared to the Far From Reality album lol) and the balance of the remaining tracks brim around the same relative level. Besides the very very interesting and unexpected combination between artist and producer (I'm still very much so awaiting the first Beres Hammond produced Natural Black album, VP are you listening???) , the real story here is the remarkable consistency of the album. For example, check the classic sounding Joy. Joy is one of the biggest vibes you'll find on Jah Guide altogether as it flows nicely over Jammy's classic Water Pumping riddim, and accentuates yet another facet of Natural Black's vast range of talents. He never reaches his boiling point on Joy (and really neither the song, nor the riddim require him to do such) but he shows off his ability to actually sing and straight chant a smoother style of vibes., and of course the message on Joy in particular is well powerful. Contrast that by checking the track immediately following it, Give Thanks & Praise, a new track, sounding like something directly out of Vendetta's studio. Give Thanks & Praise is a divine track! The song is easily amongst the album's finest offerings and isn't anything too different than we've heard from the artist before (its actually not too dissimilar from Far From Reality) but done so smooth that the song works to a degree to become one of the strongest tracks on an already strong album (also interesting how the immediately following track Jah Jah Bless begins with, `I GIVE THANKS AND PRAISE TO HIS MAJESTY!'. Jammy's does an excellent job of literally `showing off' Natural Black as an artist (and would we really have expected, or settled, for less).Yet another style is brought in on the lovely Caring and Sharing. Caring & Sharing drops in a wonderful nyah drum supporting Natural Black's vibes and he makes well usage of the support. At one point in the song he drops the actual rhythm of the song and just goes into a full talk, a beautiful message he delivers in that talk and it definitely adds to the strength of the song overall, in a very unexpected way. It actually gives even more credit to the style Black has developed as he literally leaves room for doing just about anything on a track to where the listener won't be shocked in a negative way or disappointed . Check Africa, which is another strong track from Jah Guide, just a mighty mighty one drop and a very inspirational tune, somewhat reminiscent of Beautiful Place (in terms of message, not in terms of vibes) from the Far From Reality album. Africa is more mellow top notch material from Natural Black, and a song he which actually seems very introspective as well, and shows that vibe level from Natural Black wonderfully. I'm also very fond of Make Sacrifice, which flows so nicely on a re-licked version of the original Heptones classic I Hold the Handle riddim done by Jammy. The track actually also highlights one of the better aspects of Jah Guide and a very underrated aspect of reggae music: Backup singers. Jammy utilizes some strong talent to accentuate Natural Black's range and all of the female backup singers do really well despite the rather free-flying nature of the main performer.All that being said, the song which I'm deeming Jah Guide's finest is the opener Cry Cry Baby. The song doesn't necessarily set the album off on the `correct' foot as it offers an entirely much more lithe idea of what Jah Guide is ultimately about. But when you listen to the album, you will almost assuredly come back to Cry Cry Baby as the track that stood out for you. It also captures a varying degree of Black's many styles building the song and the vibes. And, add to that its built over the classic Weatherman Skank riddim, make the track the big winner from the album. Not too different as well, although not up to the quality of Cry Cry Baby is the somewhat odd Intellectual Fanatics (the chorus on that one is just. . . Strange) nor the track following it, the obligatory herb track, Bless the Herbs. The track which stood out for me just looking at the track list was without a doubt Sleassie & Marcus and it doesn't disappoint at all, it's a very strong track! Also, check the similar vibes on Love of Rasta, yet another strong track for Jah Guide. My only real complaint here is that (and I believe I had the same critique for the Cool Nuh Black album) Jammy never turns loose Natural Black. An artist with so many different levels should be `challenged' and I would have loved to see Jammy's open the dancehall vault more and see what he could have done with the Sleng Teng riddim (or even some of the earlier Ward 21 produced pieces).Overall, still can't help but recommend Jah Guide by Natural Black. While not as all around spectacular as the Far From Reality album, Jah Guide is about as smooth of a piece of roots vibes you'll find on the shelves from the pass five years or so. Jah Guide is also a pretty revealing album, and lyrically, it may stand up to the likes of Sizzla or Lutan Fyah in certain aspects, and as I mentioned, while Jammy doesn't necessarily `turn loose' Natural Black, he does go very far in showing off a certain aspect of his style, and he shows it off greatly. Natural Black is definitely an artist to watch and through his last few album which have been receiving their deserving attention go to show not only his development, but roots reggae as a whole. Just a few years ago, I was wondering when anyone was going to figure out what `we' as reggae fans and supporters had in Natural Black, now, I'm just wondering how far he can go. Jah Guide isn't at his best just yet, but its definitely interesting to watch him along his way.

(3.5 stars)26 year old Sheldon Campbell has made a fan out of me. His style of making music has gotten to me over the years and from the first time I heard the artist, when I would essentially just tag him a Sizzla clone and be done with it, he has improved his style drastically. Always gifted with the pen, and still retaining many of his Sizzla-like oddities, Turbulence is able to hold the attention of both the hard dancehall seeking fan and especially the smooth lover's rock fan.For years his career was labeled in a way that many of his contemporaries are. He had voiced tons of good solid tunes and high quality albums, but he had never had that one big tune that would set him apart from the rest, combined with the fact that he had announced himself leaving the role of Sizzla's frontman/sidekick, he needed that one big tune.Enter his girlfriend and Notorious. Feisty songstress Sasha would make an unlikely combination with Turbulence, leading to 2 good tunes, one of which was a big hit, Want a Natty, which is available here. Notorious was even bigger, the artist's firts number one tune took him all over the Caribbean where fans feasted on it.So here you have the long awaited album, so I and many other reviewers can stop wondering exactly when the tune might appear on an album. VP Records go out of their way to showcase the record, it is redone (even from their own StB) and cut as never before. Its still good enough to be the album's best, coming in second is unsurprisedly Want a Natty (aka Front Line) featuring Sasha. The two could presumably work together dozens of times and never have a dip in quality.Also good here is much of the dancehall material of the second half of the album. Run Away, Woyeee, and Nah Run all pretty good tunes, especially Run Away Surprisingly, for a Turbulence album, there are no big big love songs on the album after Want a Natty, the artist has shown himself undoubtedly one of the best practitioners of the craft of the love song in recent times.The album is largely produced by Israeli reggae master Piloni who may be best known with artist Jah Mason, and his riddims are top notch throughout. It is a slightly rushed and flimsy project however, the picures for this one (including the covershot) are all pictures from the liner notes of the Songs of Solomon album, its most immediate VP Records' predecessor.Overall, I wouldn't necessarily call Notorious Turbulence's worst album (that distinction belongs to Sons of Solomon) but its not the absolute top notch piece that we might expect from the 'Future'. Yes, he can do much much better, but fans of the artist will probably find enough goodness here to more than justify purchase.

The main point concerning this album is the definite progression that Anthony B is showing in his lyrical ability. He was the first Bobo Dread to bust and since Kalonji and Capleton have overtaken him in both poularity and actual Skill Anthony B by comparison is now seriously working on closing the gaps. And he shows marvelous skill on this album (and another similar album called Five Deciples, (everyone here plus Junior Kelly)checkhis Come Fa which is his best effort here, i also really like his Storm is Over.All that being said the Prophet and certainly Sizzla are not standing still waiting on Anthony B to catch up to them. Capleton doesn't serve up his best here with repeating lyrics that ultimately became the base for the tune Search Fi A Find on 2 different cuts, that being said, Bun Out is amazing and the weird sounding Overtime Bomb is pretty good too, Overtime is weird sounding because its riddim is the 'riddim' for the legendary Al Green's Love & Happiness, although Capleton's lyrics are not as good as they can be on that one. Also, although I'm not a fan at all of Luciano, his tune Poor and Simple is very very good. And Sizzla, as usual rules supreme 'pon this one with his excellent Mind Over Matter and the even better, lyrically perfect Swallowfield. Overall, I say this one would probably be best for the uninitiated, if you're not a fan of rastafarian music, perhaps starting here might be best for you, seasoned vets need not apply.

The music racks aren't exactly overflowing with greatest hits albums from Anthony B. Although that's definitely a good thing, particularly with an artist who is almost notorious for his overexposure, in a musical genre notorious for the same thing. However, every now and then its always nice to get a nice greatest hits album from an established artist and 2003 was a great year to release such an album from Anthony B (especially when it includes my favorite tune ever by the artist).Some of these tunes are just. . . odd, and definitely not amongst the artist's greatest. And some still are really missing, don't know exactly how you can have a greatest hits album from Anthony B sans tunes like Raid Di Barn, Swarm Me, and of course Fire Pon Rome (that's why you NEED to pick up Real Revolutionary). The Thing, however, about the artist is that he is one of the most consistent performers in all of roots reggae.Although I don't dislike them, both $20 Coin and Celina both fail to keep the roots vibes on the album and definitely aren't amongst the artist's best. Nor, for that matter is Love and Affection and the different Freedom of Speech (actually its not that different at all. . . I just dont like it for some reason).But THATS IT! The rest of these tunes are pure winnders, even the one's that I was less familiar with. The case and point being Lie which took me from wondering "why is this tune on here?" to wondering instead "why haven't I ever heard this song?". Big song. Of course the more traditional hits by Anthony B, such as Mr Heartless, the awesome Universal Struggle, All Jah Children, Bobo Cloth, big big Damage (LOVE that tune).But of course, the best song on this album and any Anthony B album on which it might appear is Waan Back! No offense to Mr Isaacs but Bobo did the riddim as good as it has ever been done, Waan Back is HUGE, was HUGE and will always be HUGE!Overall, I won't give this one the typical reccommendation that I usually give greatest hits album where I'll say to buy this one if you are a newer fan of the artist (but you can do that too), that advice is reserved for the Real Revolutionary album (EVERYBODY needs to get that one). Instead, I'll say check this one out should it contain 'ya song'. . . ORIf you can't find Universal Struggle for the studio version of Waan Back, nevertheless, even without the definitive seal of approval, still a very good project.

Amazing album what more can I say. There are a few hidden gems on this record, songs that you'll never hear. A song like Hello Darlin' is great. So is Momma's Song. The heavy hitters are here as well, Tell Me Its Real, Life and Fee Fie Foe Fum, I love all of 'em.

Perhaps more than almost any other DJ currently on the scene, (General) Degree exhibits and understand what exactly it means to be a dancehall DJ, living the lifestyle and doing the work that needs to be done to remain at such a high level throughout his career. Often overlooked, Degree consistently remains a favorite amongst other DJ's and younger artists always list him as a favorite and even, in some cases, as an inspiration to them to become an artist.Yeah Man was an album that came out and I said to myself that I would definitely check it out, but instead I opted to go after some of the more high-profile releases of the time (i.e. Log On and Rastafari Teach I Everything); It took me 2 years to do so, but eventually I came back to it. The 2 years have certainly taken a slight dip on the album, making many of the riddims sound somewhat outdated, and some of them, honestly, I'm just tired of hearing over the time (i.e. The Liquid, the Thunder). But the time has done nothing to affect the DJ's sick ability to ride them. His flows are still top-notch, still virtually second to none and still as good as they have ever been. The best tune here is probably Stamina, which I loved the first second I heard it. Also check Spotlight, Better Jamaica, Ooh Yeahee, Summer Flow, Immaculate, Yeah Man, Caribbean Mama, Hot Girls with Tolga, More Money and The Tide is High with Degree 'protege' Chrissy D.Overall, had i bought this album when it was first released it would undoubtedly be a 5 star album, its that good and I imagine to a lukewarm fan of the music or a lukewarm fan of Degree's it would probably be that good. Yeah Man is an ultra-overlooked release from one of Jamaica's best hidden talents and the next album, the day its released, I'm getting it.

Going back through the creights full of old cd's that I had yet to give a proper listen to recently, and some of them have been sitting there for weeks,months and years, some of which I was jst flat out ashamed that I hadn't given a proper chance to EVER.One such album was Prophet Priest & King by the always enjoyable roots singer and Xterminator artist, Prince Malachi. Malachi, when he sticks to pure reggae and leaves r&b; alone, is one of the finest roots vocalists in all of reggae, and were he more active would probably find his home of popularity in the range of peers such as Luciano (whom he sounds a great deal like), Bushman and Everton Blender. And it just so happens that on P,P&K;, Malachi sticks almost fully to pure reggae as he chooses some of the finer one drops Xterminator had to offer at the time.The thing about this album (which might explain why some of the more mainstream reviewers of it have labelled it 'boring' or 'recycled') is that you REALLY have to enjoy reggae to enjoy Prophet, Priest and King, which is a plus to it. The best tune here is probably Love Jah (which I believe is the first tune the artist voiced for Xterminator) which is the title track for the US version of the album. The song is a beautiful beautiful sculpture which displays all of Malachi's talents at their greatest.Also have to check Mother Don't Fret, nice nice tune. My earlier pick for my favorite song here was Fire It is Blazing the song relates a lyrical toughness, but works under Malachi's baritone croons. Also love the title track and Jah is Our Guide. The only misstep is perhaps My Love, which is the only non-pure reggae tune on the album.Overall, like much of reggae history, if you can find it, it's definitely worth picking up. Malachi's style hasn't changed or developed much over the years (he was pretty much at the top of his game when he came to JA, and has been there ever since), so if you later became a fan, then definitely dont be afraid of this one (do be afraid of the r&b-ish; Watch Over We album). Also, being a fan of Luciano and Sizzla would also help, add them together and scale that artist back just a tick or two, and you basically have Prince Malachi. Definitely recommendable.

There was a rather massive riddim just a few years ago by the name of the Diwali. The Diwali was a soca-inspired gimmicy styled riddim which blew up in Jamaica incredibly fast powering big hits for artist's from Sean Paul, to Bounty Killa, to Wayne Wonder. I loved the Diwlai, most of all perhaps because it was clear that the producer of it, Steven 'Lenky' Marsden had a wonderful time making it, as many times as that riddim spinned, and twirled and flat out went the other way, it was clear Lenky had fun with it.And minus a few since then, South Rakkas Crew has apparently had more fun than anyone since the Diwali (and the Masterpiece) in building their latest, the Chinkuzi, because it is totally ALL OVER THE PLACE! It doesn't leave you wondering if it will at all change anywhere over it's 24 track duration, it comes with 4 of its own built in remixes! All 4 of which use the base and (sometimes drastically) offers a change over it. And they're not overplayed as none of them have more than 2 original tracks for each.South Rakkas also did a pretty goo job of artist selection, the Chinkuzi is a very very new school style of riddim which goes everywhere, and they literally went everywhere in building its roster. They even tapped Escandalo, a reggaeton artist who offers the HILARIOUS Nice. One of the funniest hooks you'll ever hear. They get 3 females, with dancehall Princess Ce'cile probably representing the girls best on her Faking, but of course the Queen, Lady Saw does well, as always on her Gway and lastly the unknown Lady Empress does decent on her track, Hot Girl.The 'standard' artists here also do very very well. Soaring mighty high is Vybz Kartel on his creative (although terribly predictable!) Good Buddy; also check 2 new masters, Busy on his fittingly titled Busy as he aggressively; scoring equally well is Idonia's Ends Lock, wish probably would have sounded better over a more typical riddim than the Chinkuzi, but it is still wholeheartedly lyrically IMPRESSIVE!The remixes go crazy, the Sweet 16 and Roller Girl are both fun. But probably the best is the Chinkuzi's Revenge which actually 'stabilizes' the riddim a little and gives it a more traditional dancehall feel. And I'm torn because the best of those tunes, and one of the best on the album is definitely Infamous by the up and coming and sometimes wicked wicked Hollow Point, HOWEVER, the song is a complete recycle of the tune he did on Vendetta's High Altitude riddim, whether he recorded this one or that one first doesn't matter, its still a negative, but the song is WICKED!All that being said, the MOST fun you'll have on this riddim, very surprisingly is listening to the closer, the up and down Bugsy Malone's RIDICULOUS No Virgin. The song gets its own mix, the Chinkuzi's No Virgin, and as much I find myself criticizing Malone's streaky career, I have to give him respect for No Virgin, of course a take on Madonna's Like a Virgin, very very creative and nice! So, rather shamefully (I kid), I'm declaring No Virgin, the best tune on the Chinkuzi altogether.Overall, I definitely recommend the Chinkuzi riddim album. The massive 24 track album literally flies straight through and you hardly even notice. Even songs like Ninja Kid's Pan mi Ting Deh and Xcytment's Good Girl(which I'm SURE follow some old television program's melody) are a good time. The bottomline being that you'll find several riddims which all around better than the Chinkuzi this year, but I'd be surprised if ANY of them are more of a joy to listen to from 2006.

I just started really listening to soca seriously again earlier this year, and of course, annually the biggest soca release is the gold album, so I had to pick it up (putting Camille Marshall on the cover didn't hurt too much either). Now I'm Jamaican, by birth (half Trinidadian), and of course soca has always been around, mostly in the form of Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, so I've always had an ear for it, but I haven't paid as much attention the music lately as I would have hoped.All of that being said, i seperate this album into 2 halves. The mediocre half, which is just that, its not bad, its just completely in the middle. Songs like Ride It, by Krosfyah, Dom Perignon by dancehall's TOK, Power Drill by Burning Flames, and the Spanish Mi Droga by Kali, are all mediocre, i can still listen to them, and I even like some of them in spurts, but for the most part, they are completely mediocre to me. However,songs 1-8 with the exception of By the Bar by Treason (now called the 3 Suns)are exceptional. By the Bar is good as well, but having bought the Treason album, Word on the Street, its familiar to me, and i'm pretty much tired of it. There is a song on here called Soca Bhangra by monard Bunji Garlin and chutney artist Shammi was a song that I could not stand when i first heard it, now it is totally growing on me. Nasty by FLO PG is also very good and addictive, this album should be subtitled ADDICTIVE, as the word also describes my 3 favourite tunes here. Tempted to Touch by Rupee is a very good song that would undoubtedly blow up in the US if we loved Wayne Wonder's No Letting Go so much, and we did. The song that is probably my favourite here is Bounce by Dawg-E Slaughter, that tune is powerful and hard and to my ears has a dancehall tinge to it, which is always good to me. If Bounce (or Wine and Bend Over by Denise Belfon) isn't my favourite song then Ah Home by Iwer George is. I can (and have) played that song and strictly that song for about an hour and still have yet to tire of it, i think its that good. Later on in the album, songs like Doh Want to Know by KMC and Dance For Me are somewhere between mediocre and good. My only complaint is that, the number one soca tune in the world currently, Snake Oil, by Bunji Garlin isn't on here. VP usually is amazing at getting songs like that.Overall, I say sure get it, why not. With my beloved dancehall blowing up in the US, i'd be very interested to see if some of these songs wouldn't have a market in the US as well, especially Tempted to Touch.I DON'T KNOW WHO MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE, OR WHERE THEY COME FROM BUT THEY ALL SEEM LIKE THEY'RE HAVING THE MOST AMAZING TIME EVER! The second cd is mostly specials and remixes which unlike reggae gold every year, is a welcome addition. Try something new, pick this one up.

This entire album is just perfect. If you like r&amp;b, you need this cd. If you like dancehall, you need this cd. And if you like lover's rock then most likely you already have this cd. 17 songs, no interludes, all strong, meaningful lyrics. My favorites are Rock Away, Wanna Cry, I Love Jah with Flourgon, Angel Eyes and African People with Pam Hall. My absolute favorite is Dance 4 Me with Wyclef Jean that's just a very amazing song. Also check Mary Mary which is a very good cut. Overall, the legend just keeps it up. Beres is the king of lover's rock.

Along with Black Woman and Child and Praise Ye Jah, Bobo Ashanti is one of the best albums Kalonji has ever done. It is about as close to perfection lyrically on an album that music can be. The absolute favorite of course is &quot;The World&quot;, and that is saying alot for that tune because it could easily be any of the other songs. Also absolutely love Courage, Grow U Locks, This Day, of course Attack, Glorify, and I could add every song on the album to that. Sizzla does his best work at home on Xterminator, and Burrell has every track pumping beautifully. If you are a fan of Kalonji's you already have this album, and if you're staring to listen to him, then by all means start here. Absolutely Flawess!

2 years ago fans of Beenie Man were treated to what was one of his finest albums in a very long time, Back To Basics. B2B was a 15 track nearly totally dancehall smash of an album which featured 2 of Beenie's biggest hits Dude and King of the Dancehall.Now just 2 years later he returns with an attempt to follow up on that fantastic album. While definitely whats going on, on Undisputed is more than interesting, this is one of those cases where whats going on outside of the studio is even more interesting. Amidst rumors of leaving his longtime mangers, Shocking Vibes and splitting with his longtime band (and the best backing band in d'hall) Ruff Kutt, and his marriage to a model who just happens to be the ex of his decade+ long rival Bounty Killa. Everything is crazy for Beenie Man!And while some may question his acts outside of the studio (especially if he really fired Ruff Kutt!), his actions inside the studio are becomming less and less questionable. Undisputed is not as good as Back to Basics, not at all. But when you just take the artist's part of it all, Beenie's flow hasn't lost a cut at all.The best tune here is probably the first JA single, Hmm Hmm, the song is the big sounding vibe that was found on King of the Dancehall from B2B, not surprisingly both are produced by the brilliant Tony Kelly. The biggest hits here which were previously released are Heart Attack and the MASSIVE Come Again over Vendetta's Sweat riddim. The flow on Come Again is something out out of a Papa San/Twista lyric handbook, flat out brilliant! And definitely one of the best songs on the album.Also check My World featuring longtime spar Lady Saw which features the best hook on the album outside of Hmm Hmm (there are HIS/HER choruses!), the two always make a good team and My World ranks up there with the best of them. Also, Set You Free is more an old school (at least melody-wise) sounding vibe over a Black Chiney riddim. And his tune Beenie Man is at least interesting because it features his wife, D'Angel singing the hook, and the flow is of course masterful.All that being said, the musically most interesting tune on all of Undisputed is the title track. The song features a wicked wicked sampling of Conroy Smith's Dangerous (pat yourself on the back if you remember the original). Undisputed is a fine fine tune, and credit goes to the continuously brilliant Black Shadow.There are missteps here: I'm not too fond of the second single, Girls with Akon or the Storch produced Dutty Wine Gal, Storch's other production, Jamaican Ting isn't a very strong tune either, however, it is ultimately saved because of the sickly flow Beenie builds around it (especially the last verse!), and the reggaeton tune Fire. . . NO! (and on a sidenote, how do you not put Wi Set Di Trends on this one?)Overall, however, the good here far outweighs the bad, and the bad even isnt that bad. Beenie Man is as sharp as ever, proving he is one of the few acts who could probably write a full album in his sleep. Glad to see him back, glad to see Lady Saw with him, and this album will appeal to many of the same crowd that liked B2B, there are no obvious crossover attempts (even with Storch on board) and its a fine fine effort from the Undisputed King of Dancehall.(and should Virgin choose not to renew him, expect Atlantic to sign him the next day)

I noticed that Yellwo Moon Records were listed as the creators of the Justice Riddim after hearing a breif clip of it and noticing the selection of the artists voicing on it.Rest assured, however, the only author of the nice nice Justice riddim is ace dancehall producer Vendetta. The cool intro to the riddim which sounds like something right out of a Godfather movie "For Justice we must go to Don Corleone", makes the audience well aware of whose the real architect of the Justice. Like most of Vendetta's productions, the Justice is fun fun fun, a huge amount of vibes, and like most version albums which run 20 tracks deep, there is a whole heap of average material mixed in here with some very good material. However, like all of these type of albums, the real star here is the riddim/producer.The Justice is a high-powered, wicked and hard hitting piece of a riddim that explodes on speakers. Of the artists that approach it, vets Capleton, Bling Dawg, Elephant Man (who seems like he should've had something amazing on this riddim which suits him fine) and Delly Ranks & Lukie D all fail to hit the mark on Not Amred, But Dangerous, Real Gangsta, Gimme Back Dancehall and U Don't Even Know Me respectively.The stars of the Justice riddim are Beenie Man and, predictably, Vybz Kartel (who mind-melds himself to every single Vendetta riddim almost immediately) who both score on both combinations and solo tracks, with arguably Kartel's combination with Wayne Marshall, the riddim's namesake being the best of the entire album. Also highlighting here is Turbulence who turns in a surprisingly fine effort on Put Love On Your Mind. Vendetta artist Alaine also scores fine on her tune Go.Also scoring well on the Justice, are up and coming Calico who just goes flat out wicked on his Gal Hunt, very big tune. And ex Elephant Man sparring partner Spice who does a fine job on her Guilty as Charged, Lady Spice is an artist worth keeping an eye on and hopefully Vendetta didn't lose her number as I'd love to hear her on his future exploits. And of course on eof the finer tunes on the album is the closer which is the just the freeflowing riddim itself, always a must to include on albums like this one.Overall, the major critique I have of this album is that unlike most of the producer's other pieces the Justice riddim doesn't change much from artist to artist. Maybe due to the 'Yellow Moon' factor, but it kind of stays the same no matter whose riding it, and I would have loved to see what he could have done in switching this one up a little. However, its everything you've come to expect from GS's Rhythm Album series, little good, little bad, always nice vibes.

Were one to look through an encyclopedia of some sorts for Reggae music for the term `Roots Reggae Singer' there would almost undoubtedly be a picture of a slim but powerfully built, tall, dreadlocked dark skinned Afrikan man with a very royal look and a spliff between his fingrs. This man would be adorned with chains and pendants displaying the faces of His Imperial Majesty and Marcus Garvey. Staunchly Rastafari, titles of this man's catalogue would repeatedly revolve around words such as JAH, AFRIKA, REPATRIATION, WAR and PEACE. To this man's credits would be a level of prolificacy during his prime which would be all but unmatched by singers of other genres. The picture that one might see if one were to undertake this scenario might actually BE that of Peter Broggs. Perhaps never before (and undoubtedly never since) has an artist so easily, almost by virtue of being themselves alone so overwhelmingly embodied and encompassed exactly what it means to be a roots reggae singer. The same way Beres Hammond and Sanchez fit the role of dancehall singer, the same way Papa San and General Degree fit perfectly as dancehall DJ's is the way in which Peter Broggs is the roots singer. Which is odd, because there is a good chance that you haven't heard of him, maybe not even a little. Even though Broggs, is the classic reggae roots singer and has made quite a name for himself on the island being one of the hardest working and genuinely good artists to work with, he has without a doubt made the biggest impact musically overseas. Here in Jamaica, I don't think it would be unreasonable to say that most people, even those who are younger in the business have an idea of exactly who Peter Broggs is and what exactly he ahs done in the vibes. Broggs is amongst the dozens and dozens of elder artists who were below the level of superstardom, which was reserved for the likes of Marley, Tosh, Wailer, Burning Spear and others, but have still left their impression on the music which continues to be needed. Peter Broggs also holds rather large distinctions in the foreign markets as he and he alone is the artist who can claim that he actually began the famed Ras Records with having the very first release on the label, 1982's Rastafari Liveth! And having gone to release several more studio albums and greatest hits compilations on the legendary label. His fan base here in Jamaica, although small, is still notable as you may find no more devoted fans to a non-superstar artist of his era; it is not unheard of for Peter Broggs' Jamaican fans to proclaim him the single greatest roots reggae artist of all-time.Perhaps what has made Broggs so appealing to many at home and many more all over the world is no frills style of recording. While he definitely lacked the showmanship (and the funding) of the Marley's, the Dennis Brown's and the Burning Spear's of the world and he may have lacked the raw aggression of Peter Tosh, there can be no questioning of Peter Broggs' commitment to his craft, to his way of life, to JAH and definitely not to his music. While others (even some amongst those I have mentioned) flirted with alternating styles here and there and even released, at times, full albums on experimental style of vibes, Peter Broggs has remained true to roots and culture virtually 100% of the time. Besides this, without a doubt his greatest overall musical ability (along with having a good ear for which compositions suit him very well and which do not), is his lyrical ability. While Bob Marley is undoubtedly and deservedly regarded as perhaps the greatest musical and lyrical genius of the era (Broggs, nine years younger than Marley, emerged very late in the King's era, and is probably better compared Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, Burning Spear and the likes), Peter Broggs is definitely one Jamaica's finest and yet most underrated and overlooked lyricists of all time. Besides, of course, being on a target which is completely rootical, tackling the same group of topics which were so prevalent amongst his peers at the time, what most normally categorizes Broggs music is the rather peaceful and serene nature in which it is presented. Broggs' music is a far cry from that of Tosh and even further away from what you would hear coming from today's roots artists (even quite literally far away from Marley's vibes as well). At its best, his music is an utter joy to listen to, again, powered by a heavy lyrical background, Broggs creates heaps and heaps of wonderful vibes and I challenge any fan of the era who may have overlooked the Hanover native to genuinely give him a listen and not be truly impressed. Vocally speaking is where, perhaps, Broggs has drawn the only criticism one can honestly throw in his direction, however, his voice is the type of voice which would probably work not at all in any other form of music. However, once you place in it is proper and raw context, the fact that truly Peter Broggs is of a select group of people who was obviously CREATED to sing the type of music which he does, comes forth. The fact that Ras Records (which was founded in the late 1970's by Dr. Dread in the States) chose Broggs as their initial artist (and I've read Dr. Dread speaking about just how he happened to meet up with Peter Broggs after being absolutely overtaken with the vibes from a song from the artist, during one of his trips, he set out looking for Broggs and thus began a very nice relationship and very nice vibes) is probably the way in which Broggs will ultimately be remembered due to the very lofty status to which the label was ultimately grow. However, for those who really enjoy the music, without a doubt he will rank as one the best roots reggae artists ever born.To date (by my count) Ras Records has released eight albums from Peter Broggs with two compilations, one re-release (of Broggs' first album Progressive Youth) and five studio albums recorded exclusively for the label. The first two albums from that group were the very well received Rastafari Liveth! (the very first release on Ras Records, as I mentioned) from 1982 and the wonderful Rise & Shine from three years later. Between those two albums, they contain many of the songs which became hits for Broggs thus, flying somewhere below the radar during the last nearly two decades worth of time since its release has been Broggs' third Ras Records release, Reasoning (an underrated release, form an already underrated artist=GOOD LUCK FINDING IT!). The songs from the previous two albums, songs like Rastafari Liveth, No Ism Pon de Riddim, Rastaman Chant Nyabinghi and of course Jah Jah Voice is Calling and International Farmer(probably Broggs' best known tune which appeared on both of his first RAS releases) are largely the ones on which Broggs made his name, but a quick trip through Reasoning reveals that the quality after those two dipped virtually not at all. And although, as I mentioned, musically speaking Broggs' music is a bit of a far cry from the vibes of Bob Marley (not in terms of quality, speaking specifically on the types of roots which they make), but coincidentally, the lion's share of Reasoning was recorded in Marley's legendary studio, Tuff Gong. Also, at the time, RAS Records was arguably the largest and definitely one of the most productive pure reggae labels in the world and thus, Broggs is afforded working with some of the best names in the business on this release. Musicians such as Aston Barrett (yet another Marley connection), Dean Fraser, Dwight Pickney, Bongo Herman, Flabba and even Augustus Pablo comprise the players of instruments on Reasoning, also checking in on the backing vocals are none other than reggae songbirds JC Lodge and Nadine Sutherland. The album opens with the very heavy Four Hundred Years. Again, as is his style, Broggs' version of the track is much more laid back than was that of Peter Tosh, but easily just as powerful. The tune is also a very fine example of how to appreciate Broggs' voice as he wonderfully melds it to the chanting chorus on the tune and it stands as one of the stronger tracks on Reasoning overall. The two tracks which immediately follow the opener are very strong as well. Cry Freedom is very nice composition over which Broggs delivers a very anthem-like piece on the injustices of the world and what may happen to those who continue to aid in making the world a nasty place. Even stronger than Cry Freedom and again, one of the better tracks on the relatively brief album is the title track. Reasoning the song is a very very nice track. It has a historic edge to it lyrically and musically is nothing atypical of much of the material produced during the era. The results find Broggs calling on the names of elders and calls onto the generations of people today to recall them and their works and to give them honor. Reasoning is a track which joins lines and lines of other songs which absolutely befuddle me as to why they weren't bigger hits than they turned out to be. Perhaps it was due to the exposure it received (which considering the time, was actually quite good, so much so that he had an entire album named after the song), the popular vibes of the time (which would have been in 1990 during one of the heavy HEAVY dancehall swings in Jamaica) or another reason but seriously Reasoning the track is definitely amongst Peter Broggs' very best efforts that you will ever hear (perhaps even more perplexing is the fact that on both of the two subsequent greatest hits compilations RAS released for Broggs, Peter Broggs Ras Portraits and This is Crucial Reggae: Peter Broggs, the song is absent as well from both).Reasoning the album, reaches its peak with track five, Trodding. The track (also absent from both greatest hits compilations) is absolutely delightful and I would go so far as to prescribe it nearly mandatory listening for all those seeking guidance in or actually living the Rastafari way of life. It is the type of song which is Trodding which even attracted me originally to go back and start heavily getting into the vibes of Peter Broggs, as I mentioned, roots doesn't get more roots than Broggs' music. And surprisingly, as I mentioned, he is significantly more popular abroad than he is here, as his music, perhaps more so than any other artist who comes to mind, specifically has the vibe to make people who follow the path of Rastafari (myself included) feel so good about following that path. Songs like Trodding are definitely what goes to make Broggs the artist he is and makes me even more vexed that he never became an even bigger star than he managed to become (and what he did become is certainly more than respectable in status). The balance of Reasoning album doesn't disappoint either and continues to impress. Check Invasion. Invasion is a warning call to those who are seeking to live and trying to live a righteous way to be ware of the coming invasion of those who are to fight against righteousness, which is a fairly standard topic of roots from Broggs' era certainly, but, again, he places his own style and signature on the vibes, which make the song very powerful definitely. Even stronger than Invasion is Vision which immediately follows it. Vision was a song with which I was familiar with going into the album. It is one of Broggs' more heavy and darker tracks (and less melodic as well) but the combination of Broggs and his top notch backing singers, particularly on Vision absolutely make the song a winner of course alongside the tune's lyrics. Reasoning concludes with one of Broggs' more popular tracks (which is featured on both of his greatest hits compilations for RAS) and an absolutely wonderful way to end an album leaving the people simply with the message to Cheer Up, despite the terrible situations and atrocities which they may face.Overall, I can't imagine that this one is all that difficult to find really (at the time of this writing it was actually still available on Amazon) as RAS over the years (despite being sold within the last two years) has always managed to keep their releases on a very nice circulation, and should you be able to pick up a copy, definitely do so. Peter Broggs is an artist who doesn't require very much getting used to at all. Despite the varied opinions on his vocal style and prowess, it is all but undeniable that he makes a very strong brand of roots and a style which encompasses and truly embodies the true intent of the music. Reasoning is a very strong showcase for one of the strongest rootical artists Jamaica has to offer, and you can pretty much make no mistake in picking it up.

I got this record simply because of the amount of songs on it, and I figured that there had to be at least a few good songs here out of the 40. And there are some good songs, a few bad ones, and two or three amazing tracks. The best out of all the songs is ES EE EX by Sean Paul, which is just vintage Sean Paul, and him at his top form. On the second cd there is Bun It by Elephant Man &amp; Mr. Vegas which is great. Also on the second cd is See Dem a Come by Mr. Lex, Bust It by Sean Paul, and two very good records by Beenie Man Cool Bwoy and Moses Cry. Back on the first Black Power by Bounty Killer is very respectible as is Cuyah Cuyah by the Prophet, Attack by Kalonji, and I'm a Big Kid Now, from Red Rat. Overall, its very good, listen to it several times and it will grow on you, good compilation by Greensleeves.

As an artist alone, and on his own merits, Turbulence is very good. His flow is good, he has no problems riding the rhtyhms, his lyrics are very good, and he seems to be willing to experiment and try a few new things in his music.Turbulence sounds A LOT like Sizzla though, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, he mixes chanting in with his djaying and doesn't seem to favour either. The only difference is Turbulence is obviously more laid back in his approach.Rising is a good record, the best cut is Just Can't Stop, I also really like Mamma is Here, Rising (even though L.M.S. is on it), Good to Know, Make Sure She Clean and Friends Like These. There are even more good songs than that, there are no bad songs here, listening to this record I kinda got the feeling that this was the best Turbulence could do, I don't know what he could do to improve, he seems to just about be at the top of his game.Excellent Album.

When I initially reviewed this album I gave it a 4 star review and said that it maybe was going to be as good as the then forthcoming Ward 21 and T.O.K. albums.And after about a year having this album. . .Boy was I wrong?!This album has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The best part of the entire project is the sleeve. Obviously, whoever wrote the sleeve, didn't write the album. The only songs still hold any kind of quality to me are Indian Summer (because of the very "Return" sounding riddim)Burning Up and So Jah Sey. I like the beat on Friday the 13th as well. The rest of this album is AWFUL. To find out how Beres Hammond got himself involved in such mess, one need only look at the producers of this one. The Taxi Gang. The riddim on the tune Beres Hammond features on (#7 If I Could Rule the World) is too slow for the Innocent Kru, who needs to be as close to slower riddim as they need to be to a Sophomore album, i.e. very far. They have not the skills to ride the slower tropical riddims yet. Speaking of skills there is a member of the Innocent Kru name Benzly Hype who is so far and away better than his groupmates that it is completely obvious to the untrained ear, someone having never heard any of the group, as to which verse is his on every song. A solo career for him, and a developmental stage for his other groupmates would do this group best.

It's been an unusual road to stardom for both Chuck Fenda and his debut album, Better Days. The artist was originally the typical, Bounty Killa clone as a badman dj, but has changed his ways in sighting up Rastafari and has found a greater measure of success (as well as quality of his music), following such acts as Capleton, Buju Banton and Spragga Benz. Fenda was suddenly on all of the big stage shows in Jamaica, and all the big reggae festivals around the world, and all of that buzz led to his debut album on 5th Element Records.The album, Better Days, was originally released in Europe in 2004, and was never actually officially released in the US, and many reggae fans were deprived of one of the best reggae albums of the year.Better Days is a tremendously impressive debut from Fenda. He uses his loud boisterous voice to its full tilt, which perhaps no current roots dj can match (with the possible exception of Capleton when he gets full agitated). He also has what I liken to a rapper's cadence. The timing of his full melodies far more resemble a more straight forward rapper's style (although in complete patois) than a rolling tongued dancehall dj style. Perhaps due to his being born in New York (whatever that means).The album opens with a stretch of 6 full tunes of pure excellence. Ruff Out Deh, Better Days, Haffi Win, No More Suffering, Serious Time and the excellent The Prayer all are big tunes and take the album to a very high level from the immediate beginning. Of course the best tune here, however, is the massive first single I Swear. The tune was so large that the riddim (which was originally named the 5th Element) became known as the I Swear riddim. Also check the beautiful combinations, Show Love and Cyaan Control with Luciano and Richie Spice respectively; and of course later single and big stage show tune, the obligatory Mama tune, fittingly titled Mama.Overall, of course I reccommend this one if you can find it. Its worth the trouble definitely. Throw Fenda in with the current astonishingly stacked stables of fantastic young roots reggae talents including such artists as Turbulence, Jah Cure, Jah Mason, Natty King and Fantan Mojah, but with his experience (albeit in another form of the music) he also can fit with the Sizzla, Capleton and Junior Kelly's of the world. The Better Days album shows him to be a deserving entrant in either case.

(4.5stars)Take any given trip to any given local record store and take notice of the truly sublime variety of vibes on the shelves marked `reggae' and you're likely to see a diversity which remains unmatched by any other musical umbrella. Because of the rather region specific nature of our music, simply put: No other one word in music carries as much `weight' literally, as `reggae'. You'll perhaps find on one single shelf an album from Mad Cobra. Next to an album from Bob Marley and somewhere down the line on that same exact shelf, you might even find an album from Mutabaruka. The gap between Cobra and Marley is MAMMOTH; the gap between the snake and Mutabaruka is even larger, and yet they'll be on that same shelf, in the same area marked `reggae'. Similarly, I can't exactly say that off of the islands of Trinidad and Barbados, respectively, that I've seen a section in a music store marked by the name of `soca', all over the world (even here in the Caribbean) you'll also see soca and calypso (and not to even go into mentioning reggaeton) mixed in under reggae as well. As I said, the word just carries so much weight in music. And while the standards to be reached as to what can mean `reggae' can be something as slight as the involvement of someone of Caribbean descent (regardless of how big or small his/her contribution to the project is) or something (which is usually the case) as big as the overall sound of the vibes, there are a couple of universal sounds which many people generally identify as reggae music. On the dancehall side you have had people like Beenie Man and of course most recently Sean Paul who have instituted to the international masses of exactly what it means to be dancehall music, ultimately that is a vibe which is, of course, listed as reggae music. These artists headline reggae shows, they are found on reggae websites, they are, essentially, reggae artists (of course the artist in question here will argue with that, however). On the other hand, there is an ultra laid back, dreadlocked and downright royal looking gentleman of Afrikan descent who sings beautiful songs about peach and love and his woman and His Majesty who, on the strength of Bob Marley, has etched the sound and look of himself into the minds and hearts of reggae fans ALL over the world. Besides Marley, there are a few men who have been charged (by no one other than themselves) with carrying that mantle of exactly what it means to be and to DEFINE what exactly is the world's view of a reggae artist.Such a man is Freddie McGregor. McGregor, along with men like Junior Reid (especially these days), the great Peter Broggs, Luciano, Mikey General and Everton Blender (the latter three names being newer, yet still to be mentioned in the more recent aspects) personifies what it means to be a modern reggae singer (one would have to mention Beres Hammond as well, although he fits into a class all by himself, one which even further blends the lines of what it means to be reggae). On that list, McGregor, perhaps is the most UNLIKELY of the names to STILL maintain some sort of level which is FAR more than that of simply relevant as he actually remains a thriving artist. McGregor isn't as vocally gifted as Luciano, Reid or the Blender; he lacks the overall showmanship of those three as well (especially Reid); and neither has he shown the seemingly NEVER ending commitment to his craft (in terms of lyrical ability) as either Peter Broggs or the supremely gifted Mikey General, and yet, his legend is as unquestionable as any of those artists having been built, or still building. Also, in my honest opinion, when all of these fine artists' time comes to an end, the one which we'll have the absolute most difficult time finding a figurative `replacement' for will be McGregor, as finding an individual so capable of making something SO great with a little bit less in the way of natural talent (McGregor's biggest musical gift is the same for Mikey General's in my opinion, which is his overall FEEL for the vibes and, while it isn't exactly consistent these days, his almost FATHERLY voice can be divine at times), will truly be a difficult task. Actually I would say that the new artist to come around in the last five years or so who best reminds me (speaking strictly vibes, of course) would probably be Queen Ifrica who so easily drifts between roots and hardcore lover's material just as McGregor does at his absolute finest. One of the strongest qualities of McGregor (and of the stereotypical reggae singer) is DEFINITELY his activity level and overall level of prolificacy during his storied career (which, by my research is a WHOPPING forty-five years deep for the fifty-two year old singer) McGregor has released (or had released on his behalf) somewhere in the neighbourhood of thirty studio albums to date and literally hundreds of singles. While McGregor is oft-critiqued for his overall consistency in his music (particularly earlier in his career), few can reasonably deny that at his finest time, he makes a brand of music which is PINPOINT some of the most quintessential and NECESSARY reggae vibes for the masses, locally and internationally. Such was the case way back in 2002 when Freddie McGregor released in Anything For You, not only what was rather EASILY his best album in quite awhile (and when I say quite awhile, we're talking all the way back to 1994 when he reached with the CLASSIC Zion Chant album, which was a compilation and maybe even all the way back to the eighties when the legendary Big Ship began sailing on the album of the same name), but just as EASILY one of the biggest projects of his entire career, altogether. Anything For You is you a high-powered showcase of an established talent and an establish legend at his the absolute current height of his powers, such an occurrence in reggae and all of music for that matter is EXTREMELY rare, to say the least. The album came through VP as one of several releases McGregor has voiced for the label (he has since voiced another) and had big shoes to fill in that respect as it followed two VERY solid albums in Signature (2000) and Masterpiece (1997). Both were excellent albums. Neither was of the overall class as the sweet sweet Anything For You.Anything For You by Freddie McGregor was originally released in the summer of 2002 which would have caught me WELL into the swing of ridiculous anticipation waiting for the forthcoming BOOM which was to be Sizzla's Da Real Thing album, but it snuck under my radars as a TOP NOTCH album for the Clarendon native (yes, McGregor falls into that LEGENDARY row of Clarendon born singers which includes names like the legendary Toots Hibbert, Barrington Levy, Cocoa Tea and Glen Washington amongst others). Anything For You, executively produced by McGregor, opens up with one of the real STUNNING tracks and highlights, the BEAUTIFUL Loving Jah over T. Dread's remake of Studio One's sweet Little Green Apples riddim. The tune maybe one of the strongest album openers I have EVER heard as it begins simply enough with McGregor literally waking up in the morning to begin some meditation on a lovely day provided by His Majesty. The song is essentially a praising track (obvious by the title) and a wondrous one in deep meditation backed by the divine one drop. If the album got ANY better than Loving Jah, or even maintained that levels, it would be a winner. Luckily for us, it does just that. Next up is the single from the album and probably the most high profile tune, Uncle Sam over Lloyd Campbell's cut of the swaying Engine 54 riddim. The tune is on a bit more cultural vibes, which is to McGregor's strengths as well, but it still has overtones of a lover's track here and there. The tune is really top notch as well and really caught on with the masses (it was one of VP's more popular tunes at the time and appeared on more than one of their compilations). Completing the opening for Anything For You is another lover's tune and what is, essentially, the album's title track, the very nice For You. This tune kind of took quite awhile to grow on me (at first it sounded a bit too sappy to me) and even now it isn't one of the highlights hear to my ears, but it goes to show you what a truly REFINED and EDUCATED artist can pull off while not even at his best. You give this tune to ANY young artist today and you run the `risk' that it may become a big hit for the youth. Nice way to get things started and really it really shows the direction in which Anything For You ultimately goes.The real show on Anything For You (as on might expect from the title) is the abundance of WONDERFUL lover's tunes. Such a tune is the DIVINE Gatepass To Your Heart which has to be considered amongst the class of the album and may be the best tune here (although something else caught my ears more). The tune flows over Willie Lindo's cut of the Rougher Yet Riddim (aka the Love Bump, which you know as having backed Sanchez` MAMMOTH Missing You), the Tun It Up riddim (also released on VP's Riddim Driven series, as was the Engine 54). The tune flows so nice and definitely stands as one of the tunes here which will make you get up and grab hold of your special someone. The only tune here to catch my attentions more than Gatepass To Your Heart was DEFINITELY the beautiful There's a Reward For Me. The tune is a MASSIVE cover of the legendary Joe Higgs' original and, unfortunately, the great Higgs had already left us by the time McGregor's version reached, but I'm sure he would have loved the tune. The song really just says that despite the terrible circumstances that we may face in this world, there remains a `reward' for our hardships providing that we live righteously. Truly a wonderful message expressed an equally WONDERFUL song. You cannot very well place a tune by the name of Sweet African Princess on any album, much less a McGregor piece, and NOT have it be a real winner, at least in effort. The tune is another in a long list of standouts as it gives a sweet sweet praise to the Black woman, which we certainly need more of in this time (and MORE from MORE skilled artists). I also have to mention (My wife's favourite tune here) the R&B; styled Oh Ah La La for Dalton Browne. The tune is a wonderful lover's piece which, like Uncle Sam, has a different group of vibes as well. I liked the changeup, and it doesn't shift too much at all, but Oh Ah La La is one for the crossovers, if you like R&B;, you'll love the tune definitely. Also check the similarly vibed sweet Prayer For Two (also produced by Browne), very much along the same lines as Oh Ah La La, but more traditionally reggae (and stronger in my opinion actually). The second half of Anything For You really maintains the levels definitely as well. You HAVE TO check Hold Me which was a big time release over Lloyd Campbell's cut of the Cables' big Baby Why riddim (also released on album, that same year by VP). Hold Me easily rivals the class lover's tunes of Anything For You and I don't think it received the push it deserved (I STILL think it could do some damage, like right now). I'll Do Anything is another strong tune (could have been the title tune actually). The tune is, arguably, stronger than For You and has a very nice sing-a-long quality to it (check the chorus and the opening verse), which is always a nice touch for singers (from Stingray). If You Want Me is another sweet tune, one which kind of flows under the radar but honestly its one of the tunes here which I've probably sparked more than most of the others. Its SIMPLY brilliant. We'll ignore and overlook the album's one real misstep, a remake of In the Ghetto (Get It On isn't that great) either. Anything For You ends with another of its big time tracks, A Prayer, over Lloyd Campbell's cut of the I'll Be Lonely riddim (aka the They Gonna Talk riddim (in a slightly different version), which you know from Beres Hammond's tune of the same title as well as Half Pints MASSIVE shot Just Be Good (To Me), also produced by Hammond). The tune places a rather nice 'bow' on the big album in a praising vibes. And if you stick around, there's a bonus track in the form of a remix of the album's finest track (in my opinion) There's a Reward, which isn't at the level of the original (it actually has an unaccredited rapper joining McGregor), but is still a nice touch to end things.Overall, when you have a bonafide reggae master, obtrusively attempting nothing in way of the crossover appeal or anything at all, at close to (or actually AT) they're absolute strongest, ESPECIALLY when thought to be at a point past their prime, you really have a SIGNIFICANT occurrence. And that's exactly what you have in Freddie McGregor's Anything For You. Since the release of this album, McGregor has arguably taken and even GREATER presence in reggae music altogether as it has been his under the umbrella of his label, Big Ship that his ULTRA talented children have thrived. Stephen `Di Genius' McGregor (his youngest) has become arguably the most well known dancehall producer in the business (big respect to Don Corleone) and the light has been shined even more on Chino (a (average in my opinion) dancehall DJ (others seem to like him though) and the `First Lady of The Ship, Shema (who sings backgrounds throughout Anything For You). Freddie McGregor has also had more studio releases with the big one being the follow-up to Anything For You, Comin' In Tough, also for VP in 2005 (on which Stephen played utility man and did EVERYTHING). He has also voiced wicked combinations with the likes of the young Assassin for his debut album, Bunji Garlin and just this year a big combination with Maxi Priest (the WICKED Make It Happen) . He has also had (again, through VP) a BIG four disc boxset which includes Anything For You in full, Freddie McGregor: Reggae Legends. And, (as if that weren't enough) he also (and it was) should probably have a brand new album forthcoming either in 2008 or 2009. Nearing a truly ridiculous FIFTY YEARS in the game, and still on top of his game. If the new album reaches ANYWHERE near the levels set by Anything For You, you can start thinking about SIXTY years, very, very soon.

I was pretty surprised to see this one available on Amazon.com. Queen Omega for the last few years has been absolutely blazing a trail for female roots reggae artists. 3 albums into her career and I have yet to hear a tune from her that I just absolutely did not like. Queen Omega probably is best desribed as a female version of a Luciano or maybe even a Sizzla as she mixes (but not so much) her standard singing with djaying, and is equally efficient at doing both.Her first 2 albums (Queen Omega and Pure Love) were both spotless, couldn't say a bad thing about them, Pure Love was the single greatest album that I heard in 2003. The best tune here is the flat out awesome Deliver Me, followed closely by the opener Jahmazing Grace, the title track and Looking For Love. Also check More Joy, De Youth and Know the Business. Perhaps the oddest track on the album is the adapted 22 Questions, which is Queen Omega's take on US rapper 50 Cent's 2003 hit 21 Questions.Overall, can't reccomend this one enough, this 23 year old singer from Trinidad is well on her way to creating a sort of consistency the roots side of reggae has never had from a female. Artists like Angie Angel and Queen Majeda have seemingly come and gone, and this woman has enough presence, voice and devastating ability of writing lyrics that she might be able to take this to the next level.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

Track List:1. Fight Against the Youth2. Give Thanks to Jah3. Teach the Little Children4. Speak of Jah5. Somehow6. Dem Ago Suffer7. Vision8. Love and Affection9. The Girls Dem10. Freedom11. Somehow (Remix)12. Right Road13. Couldn't Come Among UsArmed with a bag of lyrics, seemingly bottomless, I wonder if you asked Sizzla to sing a song called Give Thanks to Jah, The Girls Dem, Dem Ago Suffer or Fight Against the Youth, he'd pull out the acoustic guitar (which he is really good at these days) and start singing and playing, or he'd look at you puzzled and calmly say, "Which one?". While the specific titles of his music can always be questioned, the quality of it rarely is truthfully questionable. The often criticized reggae genius is so criticized because the direction in which he sometimes goes (i.e. slackness) but is supported by his fanbase moreso than probably any other artist making music today. Who else can release 4-5 real-label albums anually, worry not a bit about how much each sales and still tour extensively?Speak of Jah si what you're use to hearing from the artist, routinely high level music, a passion for his faith, a passion for beautiful women and an extreme passion for life. Only vehemently displaying his passion for the women twice (on the obligatory dancehall cut, The Girls Dem and Vision) on Speak of Jah, this album is pretty much a straight forward roots piece (incidentally brought to you by the same people that brought you Turbulence's massive Join Us last year, lot of the same riddims). While there probably aren't any surefire classics present here, the best tune is the always familiar Somehow (and its remix, acoustic) also love the fantastic Vision whose chorus travels in more ways than an average large city, the acoustic title track which truly destroys it when it gets going, Teach the Little Children which rides the same riddim as did Warrior King's absolutely massive Health and Strength and Love and Affection.Overall, while I can't honestly say this about every single Kalonji album that comes down the road, Speak of Jah contains no bad tunes, highly listenable to any modern roots reggae fan, from Jamaica's most remarkable and mysterious talent.

This one (maybe) is for the end of one of the oddest relationships dancehall and all of reggae for that matter, has ever seen. Lady Saw released her first album for VP Records, Lover Girl, when she was just 25 years old and this year the St Mary's native will turn 38 years old. Walk Out marks the seventh `child' of the relationship which hasn't been exactly sparkling at all times. Mixed in the middle was a five and a half year drought which saw the two year delay of the eventual album, Striptease and public discontent on behalf of Saw (and rightfully so) while many of her even less marketable and certainly less talented peers received a big push from the label who eventually signed two different distribution deals (not including a deal with Virgin for Beenie Man) while Saw pretty much set on the sidelines. All this was done while Saw, undoubtedly one of the label's biggest names (despite the stretch of inactivity) continued to maintain a high profile here in Jamaica, performing on some of the biggest stage shows and festivals, and recording for some of the biggest producers and appearing on most of the mixtapes coming down the road. But the reward for those of us who were paying attention the entire time has been Saw herself. Over the thirteen years we've virtually watched Saw grow up, and while countless amounts of the artists she came in with have all but disappeared, shockingly it is Saw with just a handful of others (I.e. the Beenies, Bountys, Capletons and Bujus of the world) who have endured the test of time. Her reward is achieving a level of popularity which can only be described as dancehall ROYALTY. Thus, should she so much as cough on an album, if you are a fan of dancehall, you need to pay attention.But now she's walking out. After thirteen years her contract with VP has culminated (I'm going to `go out on a limb' and assume that it was more than one contract she signed, I HOPE it was, for her sake) and she (as the cover shows!) is packing her bags in search of greener grass. Its an unusual situation to say the least (although I wouldn't be surprised at all should she keep her bags packed and catch a bus right back to VP and just. . . get a bigger room) in that, without a doubt, there isn't a label, including a major probably, that can give Lady Saw the attention she deserves. She is royalty, as I mentioned, and VP knows it. Thus, you can feel free to check out VP's release schedule and notice that it virtually cleared out a 2 month block (which includes delaying Da'ville's VP debut) since the label's last big release, Richie Spice's In the Streets to Africa and did pre-release promotion for Saw's album. I don't know of a place she can go and get that type of attention for her releases at this point. You'll find reviews for Walk Out in most major urban music publication from the states and down here, you won't walk a country block without seeing a poster somewhere for the album, the bottom line being that when its Saw's time, VP acts like its Saw's time!. . . They just have a hard time deciding when its to be Saw's time and not everyone else's, and only couple of their artists receive such attention outside of Saw, Capleton, Beres Hammond and now, presumably, recent signee Bounty Killa. I HOPE she doesn't go the route of Greensleeves (or even worse Jetstar) and thus even cut that status she enjoys now even more (despite the fact that Greensleeves is getting better), but it'll be very interesting to see where she goes.With the label taking care of their part when its her time to he shine, even they don't do as good of a job as Saw does for herself and pale in comparison. Lady Saw hasn't enjoyed such a long run for being pretty or for being one of the few females amongst the countless lines of males in the industry, she can actually flow. Not blessed with lethal story telling style of dancehall poet/lyric demon (and close friend who gets a thank you in the liner notes) or the hybrid singing style of dancehall princess Cecile (who also gets a thank you) Saw is from the old school of the early 1990's dancehall when it was about building a vibes and developing a STRICT DJ style, which is what she did, her peers. besides the more well known, are the Terror Fabulous, Mega Banton, Silver Cat etc. of the world. And she held her own as a DJ amongst some of the entirely more hardcore names dancehall has ever seen. Her style was sexual but no more so than any of the rest, she just held the oddity of being a female so she received more attention (and critique) for cutting songs which wouldn't receive any if done by a male artist from a male point of view. She also developed a style of doing like a country style in her music, at first I couldn't stand that, but even now its almost a given when Saw releases an album you'll get at least one or two `country-hall' tracks as a given (Walk Out is no different). Lady Saw has truly been one of the pillars of the dancehall, deserving just as much credit as Beenie Man and Bounty Killa as artists who began in the dance, established in the dance, made their fortune in the dance and STAYED in the dance.Her latest release, Walk Out, apart from its `historical' significance is, of course, a solid album and actually a bit better than its predecessor, the solid Strip Tease, as its cut down to a trim 14 tracks, as opposed to the 20 track monster which was the Strip Tease album. Its pretty much everything you've come to expect from Saw with one (HUGE) deviation and a few minor twists and turns; solid and world class dancehall delivered by its undisputed greatest daughter. Handling production on her own for Walk Out, Saw has compiled an album which doesn't exactly fit in on the previous era too much (where the albums where pretty much compilations) but an apparent attempt was made to build Walk Out on exclusivity, so many of these tracks have yet to be released (either that or I've been hanging around St Maarten too long and not listening to the radio) and they're not just her over the latest big riddims, although there is some of that as well (though she has historically had a problem with JA radio playing her songs last on the riddim or not at all in some cases), Walk Out appears to have been built for the sake of Walk Out and not just as singles.By far the most interesting and finest tune on the album is the first single, the self produced No Less Than a Woman (Infertility). Lady Saw touted the tune as being one that was very rare in that it's a song about a woman who has tried for years unsuccessfully to have a child. As a man the vibe didn't really touch me just hearing about it, but as an actual release, the song is DIVINE! Recorded with producer Noel Alphonso, son of legendary late and great JA hornsman and saxophone player Roland Alphonso at her home studio, Saw put her heart and entire energy in the tune and complete with the Ras Kassa directed video. The song is one of the biggest of her career and may be the place where the true strength of Walk Out rests as it has been getting more spins in rotation both the audio and the video than any other Saw tune in memory. The song has also, apparently, been getting quite a few spins stateside and of course throughout reggae-starving Europe. Definitely a big track and one worth the price of admissions alone for Walk out.No Less Than a Woman is actually the second track in a line of five tracks on Walk Out which keep it from being your stereotypical standout dancehall album. The first of the five, Silly Dreams is actually a pretty straight forward r&b; track (with the nice slight one-drop of course, Lenky and Robbie do play on the track after all) which features Ms. Hall pretty much straight forward singing, showing versatility which I just said she didn't have lol; following No Less Than a Woman is complete Sly & Robbie production Not the World's Most Prettiest in which Saw addresses mental and spiritual beauty as opposed to physical beauty. Saw's look has always been one which one wouldn't necessarily describe as `drop dead' gorgeous and things have been said, and again, its very interesting to hear her address such a thing as the subject (and I for one, always thought she was beautiful), but I guess as she's Walking out, she's making sure she completely closes the door on all matters; fourth in the line of unusual tracks is You Need Me. . . You guessed it! The obligatory country-hall track is You Need Me. The track is pretty much what you get and it's a matter of like or dislike, lyrically it's a very solid track about a falling or fallen relationship and Saw does what she does with the vibes (both she and Bushman seem to have this love for country music, they should do a combination!). And lastly rounding out the line of five is the very very interesting Baby Dry Your Eyes, with Alphonso on the boards (as he is for You Need Me as well). This track is a combination r&b;/swing era/ska on which Alphonso turns back the clock to his father's day playing with the legendary Skatalites, I love the song, completely something different and unexpected.But this IS a dancehall album.The title track is an older track which comes from Shams Baddis Ting riddim, one of my favorite dancehall riddims of the past few years and before when it was just Main Street's Baddis, I love the riddim and now through what is probably a couple dozen different tracks on the riddim overall, Saw's Walk Out is amongst the best and I don't remember hearing it, but that goes back to JA radio's unwillingness to play her tunes, which made a bad thing into a good thing in this situation. Also loving Me and My Crew as Saw absolutely rips Suku's new riddim (which is mad! Suku turning into a genius these days), very very hype track which is actually the second official JA single (with the first being Chat to Mi Back over Roach`s Mad Thing riddim). Saw wouldn't be Saw if she didn't touch the slackness at least a little and does so here mainly in the form of the self produced Power of the Pum a kind of anthem like sounding sing-a-long track about. . . Well you know what its about, but its 100% trademark Lady Saw and none do it better. Lastly, Saw tackles two of her longtime boyfriend John John's riddim with the first effort being the excllent solid Big Up over the riddim of the same name which has an old school appeal and captures glimpses of vintage Lady Saw and the wicked wicked album closer Stray Dog over the well powerful Battlefield riddim.Overall, I can't help but recommend Lady Saw's Walk Out. Besides the collector's appeal of the album, its really one of her strongest. My favorite version of Saw is that mid-late 1990's style which she absolutely ruled and on Walk Out you don't really get that vibe directly, but its an album which shows she's actually still developing, I don't know if she could have ridden some of these riddims (particularly the Battlefield) just a few years ago during her hiatus, but now she's nearing that same perfection over the modern vibes. This album, however, can center and revolve around the piece that is No Less Than a Woman, such a powerful and revealing tune is not to be missed, nor is the latest piece from a talent which Jamaica regards as one of our finest exports at her highest current level. Biggup Lady Saw, she's Walking Out. . . and wherever she goes, I'm going with her!

(4.5stars)Over the past few years I've seemingly all but LOST contact (along with the rest of the reggae listening world) with several very strong, or potentially strong, talents. There have just been so many names that for one reason or another have basically fallen off the map, whether or not we will get to see them again is another question which remains to be seen. Oddly enough, perhaps the one who was first and foremost in my mind over the past two or three years was young dancehall DJ Reagan. I don't know exactly what happened to the young talented DJ with a style which was definitely one of the most original I'd seen in a VERY long time for a dancehall artist and now he has apparently VANISHED from the dancehall scene. And he would have fit so PERFECTLY alongside the current young heavyweights of the dancehall as the (potentially VERY successful) `odd man out'. There's also, of course, VC who is actually more of a one hit wonder, and to my knowledge, wasn't actually an artist. However, WHOEVER it was that crafted the genius that was the MASSIVE By His Deeds (and it was VC), would seem to be capable of producing at least something else which the masses would enjoy definitely. I can also recall the name of Yahadanai, a chanter on the Virgin Island reggae scene, from out of Guyana (like Arkaingelle currently). Yaha, in my opinion, fit quite nicely in the vibes at the time and while I predict that we'll PROBABLY see him return at some point, he could have done quite a bit of work in establishing his name in the four years its been from he brought forward his downright AWESOME debut album, One Atonement. And there is Queen Majeeda who entranced MANY on the strength of her still WICKED Gye Nyame tune, again, I don't know what's happened with the Queen, but myself and a few who really knew the strength on that tune will definitely leave a light on for she. Thankfully, some have returned after extended breaks from the music; such as Prince Malachi recently with the BIG album One Perfect Love; Bajan soca superstar Rupee, who hasn't enjoyed a full blown COMEBACK, inasmuch as he has more so enjoyed a return to form with his recent wonderful season this year; and probably the biggest of them all, Junior Reid has basically just inserted himself as a crucial voice in today's landscape of reggae music after nearly a quarter decade of making music (same thing can be said about Mykal Rose). All of these artists will potentially ALWAYS have a place in reggae (or soca) music for as long as they make music, whether they want it or not.Another name to add to the all but MIA list (at least for me) is DEFINITELY that of Chukki Starr. These days the only representation you can catch in my players are singers like Peter Hunnigale, Peter Spence and OF COURSE, Lloyd Brown. Those artists make a brand of reggae circa 1970 with dazzling and addictive lover's rock style vibes which I have definitely come to appreciate over the last year or so. Chukki Starr was none of that. He was an artist who had his own vibes and sound and would've fit more closely, by comparison, to his Jamaican peers such as Sizzla, Junior Kelly, and even, at times, Beenie Man. Chukki Starr has a style which is much more modern and for me, it just caught me. Generally bordering somewhere between dancehall and roots, Starr doesn't ALWAYS (and this is pretty rare now that I think of it) even bother to use a spiritual platform or basis for his conscious tracks, he just chants (usually in a DJ style) for the betterment and upliftment of the world for the sake of doing good (and even when he does, such as on this album, the results are still more than just wicked at times) which is a good thing still and definitely original for the vibes. His delivery itself as well is quite refreshing as there is obviously a bit of hip-hop in his tones and cadence; it almost appears at times that he simply just starts talking on the riddim, seemingly to worry about rhyming and following the riddim later on in the tune. As for his whereabouts, he is apparently still relatively active in the UK, although international heads (of which I am one when talking about the IUK) don't really get to hear the vibes. He did `threaten' to return full force in Jamaica a couple of years ago as he voiced tunes for Stephen `di Genius' McGregor's riddims, the Ghetto Whiskey and the Red Bull and Guinness, but Starr apparently took that momentum, packed it in his luggage and returned home to the UK. Previously, he had been quite active in pushing his vibes internationally, bringing (by my count) five albums in his name beginning with 1998's very nice Ghetto Youth's Livity for once mighty UK label Ariwa Sounds. Three years later he did the double duty dropping Forever Shall Praise (the only album of his which I don't own) for a French label and this album as well. Then in 2003, there was Starr's very nice True Guidance, again for Ariwa (which featured the AWESOME lover's piece Hold Me Now, and has recently been re-released apparently, definitely check that one out); and he last reached international ears in an album form in 2005 with his Jet Star follow-up, Can't Stop It, another big album. His first effort for the once powerful (and now, also seemingly all but VANISHED) Jet Star was definitely the best all around effort of Chukki Starr's career, From Crime to Kodesh, which featured several of the tunes which have become quite popular internationally for various reasons. The album also, for me, came at somewhat of a stagnant point where I just looking for something different in the vibes (and it was to Jet Star I ran as they were doing some very nice things as the time, which makes their apparent COLLAPSE, all the more disheartening just over five years later (and I would actually say they were at least lagging as early as 2005 probably)) and it was Chukki Starr! From Crime to Kodesh is a little known GEM of an album certain to impress and entertain reggae fans of all varieties on some level all the way through its fifteen tracks.From Crime to Kodesh is PROBABLY also the most easily found album of Chukki Starr's career as well (I've actually seen it in Jamaican stores in CD form) and THANKFULLY now for those interested whoever remains at Jet Star (or whoever has purchased their catalogue) has apparently been digitizing and opening their VERY respectable vault of tunes (get that Ras Ites album out here next guys). Beginning this BOSS album after a brief intro is the first of two consecutive and three altogether (technically four, but one is a remix) signature tracks by which you can actually characterize the vibes of the total album, the BIG knowledge tune Nallage. It took me quite awhile to pinpoint exactly where I had heard this riddim before, it is the same WONDERFULLY stringy backing which played for Queen Omega's (who sings backup throughout From Crime to Kodesh) Warning alongside Capleton and Sizzla from Mickey D & Doc Marshall (who produce the majority of the album) and can ultimately be traced back to the legendary Garnet Silk`s Hard Nut to Crack. While Starr DEFINITELY has HUGE shoes to fill after those who banged up the riddim before him, what he does on Nallage is deliver a highly tangible yet spiritual and NECESSARY message for the people and its really vibes like this tune which makes me feel the man could really do major damage in Jamaica. BIG tune and obviously one of FCtK's best efforts overall. Next is the second of three signature tracks for the album, the wonderful anthem-like Revelation Time. When you come away from listening to this album the one chorus and lasting message which will probably be stuck in your head is Starr chanting `REVELATION TIIIIIIIME YAY!'. Besides being blessed with a very strong message; that things need to change and they need to change NOW, Revelation Time from a musical standpoint also impresses as it shows Starr's ability to push a message as well as remaining entertaining and melodic at the same time which is quite rare (edutainment they call it). Completing From Crime to Kodesh's opening is definitely the most eye-catching of the first three tunes, the solid Love One Another which features Starr alongside Jamaican chanter Jah Mason. Its quite interesting just how well the two styles mesh on the tune as Starr's typical range doesn't lie too far from one of the Mason's dozen or so and at times you just lose track of who's who. Mason does eventually turn up the heat and the result is the two pushing what is unquestionably the biggest SURPRISE of the album.The third standout track on the album is also the album's second of three combinations and its biggest tune altogether for my opinion., the BIG My Only Joy alongside the aforementioned veteran Jamaican chanter Junior Kelly. What really takes the tune to the heights is the simple pace of the tune (honestly you can't find much difference, in terms of quality between My Only Joy and Love One Another). It has a very simple, very NATURAL vibes to it, like the two just showed up at the studio at the same time and decided to voice it. The tune speaks of a world where people of Afrikan descent (especially the youths) realize and take full control of our potential and powers, truly, My Only Joy (produced by Starr`s own Starrdom Products imprint and it was on Kelly`s Jet Star album at the time as well, the excellent Conscious Voice). HUGE TUNE. The other combination here, Heartbreaker which features rarely seen Jamaican singer Ronnie Thwaites, is all but harmless and FAR much more of a showcase for the always impressive (but obviously ABSENT-MINDED as he can't find his way to the studio much in awhile) veteran underground singer. The balance of FCtK more than well supports the big tracks on the album as the album unrolls with some VERY strong material. Check the note to those who can't seem to keep themselves focused on their own affairs, Bad Mind & Envy. The tune definitely goes to show what I mean about Starr's approach, as he simply GIVES the direction on the tune at times unaware of where the riddim is going, just talking, but definitely pay attention to the words, lyrically MIGHTY throughout. Check the more than solid Blessings Gonna Flow (my way). The riddim on that one really caught my attention with the nice nyah drum backing if you really pay attention and of course for his part, Chukki Starr again delivers a message which is both palpable and vibesy as well. There is a tune which comes later on the album which also has a very nice RAW and NATURAL type of vibes to it which really caught my attention, Da Ghetto. The tune speaks a very nice story through which Starr tells of how he came from the Ghetto, to the music and all the trials and tribulations and potential trouble-spots he avoided because of his determination. He also speaks of those who didn't make it. The tune is really just one to listen to and I don't know if it was on purpose, but the production on it is SO minimal so you almost have to key in on the words and the words here are definitely the spotlight of the tune. The Starr goes directly to the dancehall (FINALLY) with the girl tune Girls Yu Fi Rise. No one will exactly mistake Chukki Starr for Vybz Kartel anytime soon, but he more than holds his own delivering in a dancehall vibes and perhaps what is most poignant about the tune is that, even though it is a dancehall track to its core, Starr still doesn't do it in a negative way, managing to keep things above the XXX rating and still conscious throughout. The two tracks before the ending here (which is an ODD remix of My Only Joy) are VERY strong. Fight Me is a big stepping track which guarantees that if you don't walk away singing `Revelation tiiiiiiiime!', you'll definitely be yelling `FIGHT ME!', instead. BIG tune. And lastly, Arise We Fi Rise takes the vibes back to the beginning tunes in terms of vibes. It actually might've fit better slotted next to Nallage and Revelation Time, however, regardless where Jet Star chose to plop it, it retains its magic and is quietly one of From Crime to Kodesh's very best tunes and a nice way to end things here.Overall, as I said, if you hold any interest in Chukki Starr (and obviously you do if you've read this RIDICULOUSLY LONG review) then just take note of the fact that From Crime to Kodesh is his best album to date. And I would certainly love to see the Starr try and change that fact by placing another project out for the people and returning to the international scene. Even though Jet Star is off the scene, they have been replaced by the very active Cousins Records in the UK scene who have shown an interest in local artists releasing the last pieces of Brown, Spence and Hunnigale and I'm sure a Chukki Starr album would look very nice in Cousins catalogue. As it stands, Starr remains one of my musical enigmas. Hopefully he'll show back up on my speakers someday soon as if he can make more material like From Crime to Kodesh, I'll leave the door open and save a spot for him. You should too.

While the old dancehall heads and some of the `in-betweens' (such as myself even) may maintain that what you here in the dancehall, in terms of production in the last decade or so is completely less than what we heard in the previous two, even the most hardened of them (us) will have to admit there have been some SERIOUS riddims to catch on in the modern era. For whichever of a whole heap of reasons there are dancehall riddims which, born in today's day and age, will make an IMMEDIATE impact when spun in almost any dance or club, locally and internationally across the dancehall and pop-loving world. For example, after all the DAMAGE it caused internationally on the strength of two international dancehall hits and one pop/R&B; hit, it is all but certain that the Diwali riddim is unlikely to ever be forgotten. The same digitalized hype chutney/dancehall composition from Buju Banton's longtime (recently returned) keyboardist Stephen 'Lenky' Marsden's 40/40 Productions literally TOOK OVER when it reached in 2002 and beyond on the backing both Sean Paul's (more on him in a bit) HUGE hit, Get Busy and Wayne Wonder's equally sized piece No Letting Go. It also went stateside for young Lumidee's breakout hit, Uh Oh. The riddim's shelf life has also proven to be quite well, musically speaking, as just last year, ANOTHER big hit was spawned from Kingston sisters and duo Brick & Lace, Love Is Wicked, which was also the name of their much anticipated album (and STILL anticipated if you live in certain countries as it apparently won't be reaching worldwide until next year). Also, while FAR less known than the almighty Diwali altogether, a more recent riddim, the Smash, also has to be considered such a riddim on the strength of one crazily infectious tune which left women dancers (and UNFORTUNATELY quite a few men) all over the world with dizzy headaches as over it Tony `Mentally Ill' Matterhorn delivered what was perhaps the biggest international dance craze since the Macarena with his Dutty Wine. Most people will NEVER know the name of the riddim which it flows over (and fewer even will know that it was built by Supahype Davis and Serani) but to this very day, you're sure to get a HUGE response by spinning in Jamaica or off! You also have riddims such as The Playground riddim (which you'll know of simply by me mentioning the phrase `sim simma!'), the World Jam riddim (which backed Damian Marley's MAMMOTH Welcome to Jamrock) and the re-energized Last War riddim which was brought back servicing Collie Buddz' hit Come Around. All of these Jamaican born riddims within the last few years (with respect to the original version of the Last War riddim) to a decade have touched the international community to the point where almost immediately when they drop, they can be instantly recognized by music fans worldwide.In this particular case here we DEFINITELY have yet another riddim to add to that list, speaking about Troyton Rami's now unforgettable and soon to be CLASSIC Buzz Riddim. The riddim will forever be linked to the label VP Records' decision to suddenly pump some new life into its long running series of the biggest reggae compilation in the world, Reggae Gold, by recording a video for the album's lead single and distributing it internationally, Sean Paul's Gimmi Di Light. The tune was also to be the lead single from Paul's upcoming sophomore album at the time. The tune went on to be the BIGGEST dancehall tune in quite some time and has since served as the basis for Sean Paul's dancehall superstardom and becoming literally the international modern face of dancehall music, despite probably not being amongst the top ten or so regarded acts in Jamaica at the time (although he was and arguably remains one of my favourites despite the backlash of him `crossing over`, due to the fact that at his best the man can just FLOW). While I don't know if it did exactly what it was intended to do (in terms of selling the album, Reggae Gold 2002 which was released around six months before Sean Paul's own album with the tune, Dutty Rock), it certainly took dancehall on an international stage to the next level. The Buzz Riddim, itself, from the aforementioned `Black Shadow' Troyton Rami was actually pretty good as well, at least to my ears. What it was (as are ALL of Rami's productions) was top notch craftsmanship and production. It was POLISHED: The riddim's real strength is definitely in its very defined and detailed vibes which, at times and in the `right' hands can make it downright addictive. Rami's history as a producer, at that time (and certainly now), was pretty good as well; he had been producing on his own for his own Black Shadow for over five years and he had scored a few big riddims and a few big hits with his pieces. Most notably, to my ears was his KNOCKING Mad Sex riddim (no pun intended) which backed one of my favourite Sean Paul tunes from longtime, S-E-X. And since the Buzz, he probably has scored the biggest with his Surprise riddim which you know from having backed Buju's big hit, Paid Not Played and the Ching Chong riddim as well which did quite of bit of work for Black Shadow locally. The Buzz riddim would actually reach album almost a year prior to Dutty Rock and a half-year even before Reggae Gold 2002 because obviously Rami knew just what he had on his hands and put it out on his own dollar through his Black Shadow label and he has certainly reaped the rewards ever since (he also did the same with his last release, the hypnotic Bad Dog riddim and the Blink riddim and maybe even the Surprise if I recall correctly) having definitely given his Florida based label a `centerpiece' for a very long time to come. The Buzz Riddim album somewhat unearths a well known `secret' as it reveals the other STRONG pieces which went far more under the radar internationally while becoming pretty big hits locally: Bigger even than the uptown superstars effort itself.The Buzz Riddim, as if often the case of riddims which feature a breakout international hit had a situation where by far its most popular tune wasn't its most played or respected locally or even it's best (of course, that's objective). I can recall living in the States at the time of Gimmi Di Light's breaking out and traveling back home CERTAIN I would be overwhelmed by the tune playing only to be turned on to quite a few stronger and locally more popular selections from the riddim. After a mix/medley style brief opening of several of the tunes on the riddim, getting things started on The buzz Riddim album is one of those aforementioned more popular tunes (albeit not stronger), Capleton's I Love To See. The tune actually is one of my least favourites on the buzz altogether for some reason. It just never really struck a vibes with me; Capleton's real strength is rarely appreciated on such a dance heavy type of vibes and he kind of delivers a so-so effort on I Love To See. Next up is a stronger tune than the main attraction here and DEFINITELY the Buzz riddim's most controversial tune altogether, Sizzla Kalonji's now infamous Pump Up. The tune was marked by MANY detractors of the roots legend as the definitive sign that he had indeed lost his righteous ways and turned to the slack style of many of his far more internationally known dancehall peers. Me personally (and I am as PARTIAL as can be towards the artist who is my absolute favourite ever) don't feel that way about the tune. While it isn't my favourite of his catalogue, it has grown and grown on me over the years and if you REALLY listen to the lyrics he really remains true to his righteous, fire-breathing ways and technically speaking, of course he does an excellent job riding the Buzz itself, one of the best actually. And no one ever said that sex couldn't be righteous either. Closing the opening of the Buzz Riddim album is one of the more popular tunes on the riddim and one of the real highlights here because, although it was a hit, I don't know of any other official album which contained the tune, Beenie Man's hit Toy Friend. If you've ever had the opportunity to see the Doctor live (since the tune has reached, that is) you'll know its definitely one of his favourite tunes to sing as well. The tune is so nice because of the unique melody approach Beenie utilizes: As the Buzz hardly ever changes (I don't notice any actually) in its fourteen tracks, it sounds like it does with Beenie singing the addictive chorus on one of his more underrated hits of all time completing the opening for the Buzz riddim very nicely.I don't particularly know why Gimmi Di Light caught on so much as it did (the reason I think is that the world was just SO THIRSTY for some real dancehall), but that's not to deny the strength of the tune at all. Gimmi Di Light isn't one of Sean Paul's best or even better tunes (PROBABLY top fifteen or twenty) but it does show a bit of his very nice skill of delivery and pacing. Definitely it's the tune here which will get the most attention and I don't hate it at all. The tune here which probably DESERVED the most attention, however, is when longtime dancehall bad boy Mad Cobra chimes in with his AIMED gun tune, the WICKED Press Trigger. The Mad Snake put the Buzz through its paces coming as hard as he had done at any point in the surrounding time on a tune which was definitely on his usual more aggressive vibes and a throw back to one of dancehall's real classic artists. If there ever were a clash of ALL dancehall artist and one man was left `standing', I'd put my money on Mad Cobra to be that man and it would be on the strength of tunes like Press Trigger. HUGE TUNE! The big names continue to roll in on the Buzz riddim. Elephant Man checks in (unfortunately) on his Haters Wanna War. I don't like this song very much at all and I never have, its just a song which sounds so freestyled and very far from his best. Longtime former Sean Paul spar Mr. Vegas also checks in with his DECENT effort, A Nuh Di Same (aka Think It Over). The tune (along with several on the Buzz) probably didn't make the Kingston singjay any fans at Outrage, but it was still a pretty solid track at a time when Vegas definitely was making some of the stronger vibes of his career and while it didn't do much damage, I still catch a nice vibes from the tune. And Beenie Man comes back with his second effort on the riddim Gal Dem We Love. This tune isn't on the same level of Toy Friend (and Outrage won't like it either), but it still is SO skillful. Longtime you have to appreciate Beenie as one of the most talented youths Jamaica has EVER produced, take a deep listen to Gal Dem We Love; he won't say anything PROFOUND in nature at all, but the tune is put together so nicely, have to give credit where its due. A few of the lesser known names here, however, actually outshone their more popular counterparts later on the Buzz Riddim album. Check Mr. Easy's ULTRA SMOOTH Don't Test Me. The tune probably ranks as one of the underrated Kingston singer's more popular tunes of his entire career and definitely one of my personal favourites from the artist. Definitely check Don't Test Me out (and still waiting on that album Mr. Easy). The final two vocal tunes on the Buzz Riddim album are actually two of my absolute favourites on the riddim by two of the lesser known names as well. First is the curiously voiced Rekha's BIG Too Close. This tune was a REAL hit for the young Miami based singer and definitely suggested that big things were to come from the wonderful talented. HOWEVER, since then she has actually NEVER RECORDED FOR ANYONE BESIDES BLACK SHADOW (at least not to my knowledge), but has ran a release on nearly each and every one of the label's riddims (she may actually be married or related to Rami). Whichever the case, Too Close is by far the crowning jewel of her teeny tiny string of tracks (and I've never heard a bad tune from Rekha); I just wish she would record more, definitely. And closing things is one of the CRAZIEST roots artists to come across in a LONG time, the hype Jah Thunder with the crazy and at times hilarious Name. Thunder is a long time member of his cousin Capleton's David House camp (along with the continual everyday names such as singer Moses I and the RIDICULOUSLY talented Military Man) who has been behind the scenes for FAR too long actually. Name is a tune breaking down the names of some of the most popular Jamaican artists (and later some of the more popular American artists as well) and exactly what they should do with their famous monikers (LITERALLY). The tune is definitely in jest, however, for some reason Thunder reserves his `harshest' booms for Ninja Man (who didn't give Capleton exactly an easy welcome into the game when he began). Ending the Buzz Riddim album nicely is Jah Thunder who DEFINITELY outdoes his far more well known cousin, King Shango. And there is the obligatory (thankfully) clean version of the Buzz so you can try it at home, the clean riddim is always a nice touch on riddim albums.Overall, while the Buzz is destined to be and to remain one of the most popular riddims of all time, largely based on Sean Paul's and Gimmi Di Light's success, its definitely so much more than just that. While Paul certainly does offer one of the highlights here, for me personally, some of the other songs eclipse Mr. Dutty Rock and really had the `unfortunate' cases of being almost swept under the rug, internationally speaking, because of his success (DEFINITELY not due to Sean Paul himself). But, for that fan who just fell in love with the vibes of Gimmi Di Light and all these years later is STILL in those vibes, the Buzz Riddim album is exactly something you'll love. Older fans, you probably know all of these tunes already and probably own all of them. The dancehall and its fan will never forget Troyton Rami and Black Shadow if they do nothing else for the one big shot spawned by his Buzz riddim; but for those who choose to dig just a little deeper, there remain just as big of gems waiting to be discovered.

(4.5stars) I got this album, which was Turbulence's first after I had gotten the second (Rising) and was very impressed by that one as well. Since then, I have seen this young man in concert with Kalonji and let me say that no cd can do him true justice, he can sing out of this world.This album is one I would classify as a gem, meaning, it is pretty hard to find, ( I ordered directly from Xterminator )but it is worth the effort. There are 13 tracks, only one that I don't really like (Woman A You) and 12 very beautiful songs that you can just enjoy from a purely musical level, or you can dig into the lyrics for complete understanding and see exactly where this yute is coming from. One of the more interesting things that I notice in this album is that Turbulence, a devout rastafari, rarely directly writes verses where he draws on Selassie I by name, instead he chooses to use indirect mentions, where he'll say &quot;The Lion&quot; or &quot;His Majesty&quot;, I find that very interesting, because, including Beenie Man, there aren't many rastafarian artists that write and don't use the word &quot;Selassie I&quot;.There are several tracks that I really like here, the opener Living in Sufferation is fantastic, and a great example of how Turbulence varies back and forth between singing and djaying. Where are Your Wings? is a great upliftment tune for the Black Woman, I like One Gun, I absolutely love Freedom Call, and the closer Don't Let Them Stoop You Low is outstanding as well. If forced to pick a favorite I'd probably say Living in Sufferation. I also like Love Can Make A Difference which VP loved so much, they chose to include it on his second album as well. Overall I say definitely get this one, its an absolutely beautiful project, and a beautiful beginning from one of reggae's most promising future stars. AMAZING

Of course anytime Ras Records jumps up and releases an album by a quality artist like Sizzla Kalonji its worth a listen. Last year they shouted out with The Truth by Kalonji protege Turbulence, and the material on that one was very high, Jah Knows Best is no different.The strangest thing about this album, is of course, track 3 Subterranean Homesick Blues which by virtue of its recording becomes Sizzla's first and only cover tune, here of a Bob Dylan track and its listenable, the flow on it is pretty different for a Sizzla track, but its entertaining nontheless. Interestingly enough however, my favorite track here, besides the (truly massive) title cut I Myself Know, which rides a classic hip-hop/r&amp;b riddim, but the wording of the song is soooo powerful that it might have even been better as an accapella. The finisher here (literally) Jah Is Love is the typical Sizzla falsetto offering with the heavy nyah drum backing him, but its honestly one of the reasons that most of his fans fell in love with him, he sort of loses himself in his wording and seems at times to just speak from the heart, heavy Rasta tune, of course. Of course there's the obligatory dancehall portion of the album, the best of which is probably You World Leaders, but I like Move Up as well.Overall, I might actually give this one the nod over his earlier effort from this year Speak of Jah. Its your typically high level offering from one of the best artists around and only he himself can top that.

It's rare that an artist can come along at one time on a given album and reach a level of lyrical perfection. What Tanya Stephens does on is just that, and she does it without pulling any tricks or doing anything irregular. Gangsta Blues (a very very apt title) finds Tanya Stephens in many many different moods and I'm glad for it. Inside the reggae community Tanya Stephens has always been known as a good artist, but she hasn't found the success that some of her more well-known peers have (particularly Lady Saw, Patra, Diana King, Ce'cile), but what she proves on this album is that when you take everything else away and leave her with a pen and a riddim, this woman is perhaps the finest female talent dancehall can boast of.The absolute best thing about this album is its setup, interspersed with brillant setups and spoken word here and there along with traditional reggae topics and current dancehall sounds (although most are unique to this album) it shines purely on her words. And her words are the store, songs with quite sappy titles such as Little White Lie, The Other Cheek and Sound of My Tears prove rather quickly that they are flat out brillant and nothing else. The only song here that I was really familiar with is also one of the album's best Its a Pity. The only 2 times where Stephens draws on help is on Gangsta Gal which ultimately proves to be an ode to women to stick by their man and features Spragga Benz in yet another classic combo between the two (this time more 'overground') and on the equally sappy titled This Is Love featuring Wyclef Jean, it all works. The best song here is probably Little White Lie which is unarguably the deepest piece on the album, just straight emotion about a particular situation that is unfortunately real in current society (all over the world). Also great is the opener (after the intro) Way Back where Stephens throws respect to times past. Also check Boom Wuk, which is about as sexual as Stephens gets on the album and its great, really realy great riddim (almost 'Lenky sounding'), and the closer We a Lead which is the obligatory 'bad gyal' anthem which Tanya Stephens the hardcore dancehall dj just completely duns it!Overall, like I said, the star here is Tanya's words. Every line follows the one that proceeded, there is no filler, it all makes perfect sense and that's rare in dancehall. . . that's rare in any music, its a blend whose time has come. The patois is not too heavy on this album (it never is with her) so it may be easy for newer reggae fans to check out. Also biggup to VPRecords for the packaging, the cover is very very nice, done very well. Biggup to the artist for taking her time, if I know this is the result I'll wait ANOTHER 5 years for the next one (but I don't want to have to).AMAZING GO GET IT!

It is perhaps a testament to the current and ever evolving state of affairs in reggae music that that I could have even 'overlooked' this album. With so many roots and culture tunes and riddims riding high in the last 3-4 for years (so high even that dancehall is now 'questionably' Jamaica's favorite musical genre) it can be difficult to sift through all the various riddims. Such was my case as somehow, someway, the relatively HUGE Lion Paw riddim album managed to fall through and end up in my closet!Luckily for me, I love cleaning out my closet a couple times a year. The Lion Paw riddim birthed several hits actually, so it was to my utter surprise that as I went through the various unopened riddim albums (the Caribbean Style, the Tiajuna, the Blackout, the Slingshot etc.) that it too was included. The Lion Paw is a might powerful riddim! I guess listening to other big ones of the same time period, which would have included such MASSIVE riddims as the I Swear, the Drop Leaf and the Hardtimes, that I just forgot about it.But the shelflife of a big riddim actually never dies! And, having heard many of these songs not so much in the last year and some of them not so much ever at all, I was thoroughly delighted in making my way through the Lion Paw. The riddim was built by Mikey John, and named after his own Lion Paw Productions.The biggest Paw here was probably Richie Spice's nice nice Its Gonna Be More Terrible which is a really really big vibrant beautiful song on the riddim. The other really big hit was Morgan Heritage's awesome Hail Rastafari. I'm not a very big fan of the Morgans, but they make some of the most beautiful one-drop driven reggae today, and I have to confess!But I'm not calling either of those the best tune here. In my complete and utter bias to one Ms Nadine Sutherland, I'm definitely declaring her nice nice Stop Your Bad Mind the best song on the Lion Paw. She controls the riddim better than any male who voiced on it, and of course those top notch vocals, which made her a legend here are on full display.There really isn't a bad song here (although I'm terribly fond of Brian & Tony Gold's Prayer, even that is starting to grow on me), the biggest complaint I might have for the Lion Paw riddim album would be who is not here. It lacks, Sizzla, Capleton and Junior Kelly, all of whom (especially Kelly) would have sounded wonderful over this beautiful riddim.Check Jah Jah World from Anthony B; Equal Rights by Luciano; the brilliant Only Jah by Bushman (which VP should probably manage to squeeze in on his next album (and PLEEEEEEEEASE stick Arms of a Woman on there as well!)); Natural Black's Treat Her Like a Lady; Turbulence's I Will Survive on which he turns out some of his finest singing ever and Warrior King's nice nice My Life.And then there's Jah Cure. Were I to take off my Nadine Sutherland colored glasses and put on my typical clear ones, I would most definitely declare Cure's AWESOME Searching for a Girl the single best tune on the Lion Paw. Every once in a while Jah Cure will take reggae's most unusual and powerful voice and push it to its upmost extreme, as he does on the hook on this song once or twice and everytime I hear it, I love it, Searching for a Girl, a song about. . . someone searching for a girl, is a huge huge tune.Overall, I'm definitely recommending you all go searching in your closets and see if you have a copy the Lion Paw riddim album. And then, when you discover that you don't have one, I'm recommending you scour the half off bin at your local West Indian record shop and pick this one up. Although not giving the publicity of the riddims which outshined it, the I Swear, Drop Leaf and Hardtimes, the MIGHT powerful one drop of the Lion Paw is just as good as any of the rest.

There are 3 big dancehall group albums that drop this fall, Innocent Kru was the first, T.O.K. is the second and Ward 21 will be third, of the first 2, T.O.K has to be considered the best.This album, which I felt would ultimately be an overhyped flop, is fantastic. I understand all the hype now, its more than warranted!There are several excellent songs here, but the best has to be Gun Shy, the flows on that track are just ridiculous. Gimmi the Muzik wih Shabba is also very good. You also have Man Ah Bad Man with Bounty Killer, You Ah Murder, I Believe It, All Day and Keep It Blazing. Overall, even if the geniuses at VPRecords neglected to put Bun Friend Enemy, TOK's best record on the album, its still very very good, and will be difficult for Ward 21 to top.(Oh yeah and Chi-Chi Man is on the album too)

If you've never heard any of these songs before, then this version of VP's celebrated compilation series might actually be a 5 to you, however, some of the tunes (i.e. Log On by Elephant Man, which isn't bad) have made the rounds on this year's compilation circuit already.But what can I say about this album? There are 16 cuts, only one bad song (Cuss Cuss by Dillgin &amp; Mark Ice). There's the massive Can You Do the Work? by Cecile and Sean Paul, which might be the single best song I've heard all year, there's the nice big commercial rhythms (Rice and Peas and Liquid) there's the high profile combination of artists (Cecile and Sean Paul, and Elephant Man and Spragga Benz) and you have the unkown artists breaking out big (Warrior King on the wonderful Virtuous Woman, who sounds lyrically somewhat like Turbulence). And by the way, check out Mind Over Matter by Kalonji and Mr. Nine by Buju, both terrific cuts, and Anthony B's song Equal Rights as well.Overall, its a good album, even better if you don't have too many compilations from this year already. but even if you do, there are a few good songs here that you can't get anywhere else that make this worth a buy.

The once mighty Krazy riddim from early 2003 had dancefloors all through Jamaica more crowded than usual at it's peak. The riddim also went about as far as any before it in establishing a then up and coming, now top-flight producer, Vendetta, as one to watch at the controls in dancehall music. It had some bonafide hits, and somet that even had a little mainstream appeal beyond the dancehalls of Jamaica.With a whopping 22 tracks (still missing a clean version of the riddim) and no solo artist repeating on a track (with the exception of Ele doing a feature for Wayne Wonder) most of dancehall's elite voiced the Krazy with the most notable exception being Beenie Man. You get a few names that you've never heard of before (and you have never heard from since) a few then up and comers and a few that are still on their way 3 years later.The best tune here is definitely the ultra clever Rhyme by Ward 21. The tune does everything but Rhyme and to this day is one of the finest efforts the Ward has ever put out. Also of course check the other 2 bigger hits from this riddim Ele's Krazy and one of the many nice combinations from Kartel and Wayne Marshall Why You Doing It?Besides taht are the tunes that didn't really make it to stations with much success but are fine tunes still Wayne Wonder and Ele's Crazy Feeling and Assassin's fine Too Show Off. Also really check Lady Saw's ot Gyal.There is such a wide variety of artist's recording here; Roots stalwarts Determine, Junior Kelly and Anthony B seemingly find themselves out of place (especially Kelly) but they all do fairly well on their respective tunes, particularly Determine on his Top Form (Determine was going through a period where he did some find dancehall work over not only the Krazy but also the Time Tracel and Knockout riddims).4 out of the final tracks on the album turn to decidedly newer artists. Wicked Calico steps way forward on his awesome Monogamy and is only slightly topped by one of the most underappreciated young artists to ever emerge from JA, Reagan, his story tellinng style and ability to forever back it up makes him one of the best lyricists in dancehall right now and his Mi No Know is on the lite side, but still a fine example of his wonderful execution.Overall, 22 tracks of this riddim which never deviates from its original form not even a little bit will tire even the most hardened dancehall head (myself included) but the riddim is top notch, so I would reccomend it to a fan. Newer heads, these tunes aren't all that old so the original 45's are still readily available if you search for them. Love the riddim love the way some of the artists and particularly the producer have improved over the years, but the Krazy riddim album is still a full pack of excellent vibes.

I've always likened Jah Cure to a singing version of reggae great Sizzla Kalonji. They both just seem to be on the same level of consciousness lyrically and the way they seem to be easily able to get their message across. Speaking of Sizzla, I find it very interesting that the first voice that you hear on this album is that of Sizzla, on the opener and possible best track Every Song I Sing, very very good on the lyrics. If Every Song i Sing is not the best tune here then certainly Hail to My King is, that is a song that everyone, every religion from Rastafarian to Atheists can appreciate, really powerful. All 15 tracks, not a bad tune amongst them, also really love the combinations one with the aforementioned high priest Sizzla Kalonji on the older King of the Jungle, if you've never heard it, then you'll probably love it, and if you have heard then you'll relish in having it on cd (that is if you neglected to get Sizzla's Greatest Hits Album last year), with Jah Cure providing the amazing vocals and Sizzla stepping in with the very meaningful verses. Also really lie Zion Way, Zion Await, How Can and Trust Me and also Vibes Man a Build, and Hanging Slowly, and i could go on, every track is nearly perfect in its sound and of course, its lyrical point.Jah Cure is an album artist, only having 2 albums so far i know that may sound weird, but i have never had the experience of seeing him perform, i can only imagine, but his voice is soooooooo powerful on this album and his first that I am convinced that he can do what he has done so far in his career which is releasing albums every 2-3 years, and that works. His first album was critically acclaimed as this one is destined to be, he sounds excellent on album, and his writing prowess ranks right up there with lyric king Sizzla, he is truly on that level. As he is currently serving a long term prison sentence, a young singer might be wise to hire him as a songwriter because i assure you it gets no better than this in lyrics. AMAZING! GO GET IT

I've always regarded LMS as a talented and yet unpolished version of their older siblings of the Morgan Heritage camp. And I view them with almost the same apathy with which I view the older Morgans, although in the case of LMS, the reason why is much more explainable. I can't tell you why I don't necessarily feel the vibes of the richly healthy and divinely talented roots which Morgan Heritage puts out. However, in the case of LMS, were they a straight reggae group, they would easily be amongst my favorite. They attack reggae with the youthful interest and zeal you would expect from such a young group, however, the Boston raised trio always feel the need to flip the script in the duration of an album, and sometimes even the same song.Having a flair for mixing reggae with hip hop and r&b; is by no means new, several artists including the downright brilliant Shinehead made a career out of doing just that. And you can absolutely tell that the young Morgans grew up listening to what most young kids from Boston grew up listening to. However, luckily for myself, they mixed in some serious reggae, and not just hanging out with their big brothers and sisters. They have a definite love of reggae and throughout this album, the junior of 4 albums which they currently have. Straight From the Root had a definite strong vibe going into as well. Produced by one of the best roots producers to ever touch reggae music, Phillip 'Fattis' Burrell of Xterminator, the same producer who had molded serious talents such as Luciano, Sizzla and Turbulence, was working the boards and musically, the album is, as expected, more than on target.So what's wrong? As I said, LMS can't refrain from taking the half-reggae, half-hip hop and r&b; route, which can be done well, but. . . not by them, it almost seems like 2 different groups when the hip hop tracks go on, Miriam, the fine female vocalist takes an immediate back seat to the boys when it starts and lead dj/mc Laza accent reverts back to straight out of Boston, and far far away from 'the Root'. Check Stogee, where other sibling, singer Shy-Poo rides shotgun to Laza and the two combine on a hip-hop sounding riddim and the song is just odd! You wouldn't expect something like that to pop up on such an album, and Laza, ultimately through the course of Straight (as well as their other albums) proves to be a much better dj, than an mc.Take Stogee and directly contrast it with the nice nice opening title track which is recorded over the same riddim on which Sizzla voiced his excellent Sound De Trumpet from a few years back. Straight to the Root is another track on which Miriam doesn't take too much of an active role, and the tune mainly consists of the two boys, and its so much more vibrant and all around just a much better track than Stogee. Also check the difference between the relatively cookie cutter styled r&b; love song Al I Find In You and the exceptional Love 4 U which finds Miriam basically doing a nice nice combination with Xterminator singjay (an uncredited) Turbulence. The song isn't even completely a reggae track, however, it definitely works (I'm not asking for alot!).The real strength of Straight From the Root (and maybe of LMS' entire career) lies between tracks 8-11. What a wonderful vibe is discovered just between those 4 tracks! First check the fine Can't Go to Zion on which Laza and co. exclaim exactly what you need to do to reach Zion's gates, "can't go to Zion if yuh carnal minded!", the song probably makes the best usage of the overall underused Miriam as a backup singer, and features TOP NOTCH djaying by Laza. Then check I Love Zion which flows over the same gorgeous Nyah drum backed riddim which backed Turbulence's superb The Truth title track.The last wo songs of the 4 feature the best tune overall on the album, the MASSIVE Wi Tell Dem. The song is the most fun on the album and it seems like they finally stopped trying to be so precise and just had fun with it, and of course it happened on a tune which does absolutely nothing but praise His Majesty! The best hook on the album with Miriam's nice vocals is also featured on the tune and its just a huge vibe altogether. Then the large Smile & Joy which rides the same big riddim Sizzla rode to fine effect on his We're the Ones track from the Stay Focus album. I give the song nice credits because its one of the few that blends the JA and US styles to an excellent effect. Also, I must recommend the album's closer, the rather quirky Rock the Station, which is actually something different that WORKS (and the fact that it features more nice djaying doesnt hurt at all)!Overall, I've made two lists of reggae/dancehall albums hip hop fans would like. However, were I to make a similar list, including r&b; fans, I'd definitely put at least one of LMS' albums rather high on the list. Take my review for what you will, I'm a reggaehead, and while I do enjoy hip-hop and r&b; on occasion, I'm VERY partial to pure reggae vibes. So take that into consideration, while I'm wishing the obviously talented group would come live here for a (forever) few years, if you like your reggae with a twist, then this root just might be your favorite drink.

I don't think I should necessarily go into a big discussion about how the year is only 65 days old and Sizzla has one album now on the shelves and another set to be released in a few weeks. I don't think I should necessarily go into a big discussion about how he finished last year with an album in November, 2 summer albums a greatest hits album and an early fall album. I don't think I should necessarily go into a big discussion about how disturbingly prolific the artist is, so I won't.Instead, I'll just talk about the music. The musical highlights here are without a doubt the combinations. Free Up the Prisoners is the long awaited track between Kalonji and prodige' Turbulence, pretty good message on the track and pretty much what one might expect from two high level artists, although I might have preferred them riding an Xterminator riddim instead. The other, perhaps even more interesting combination here features Sizzla with Vybz Kartel on Live Up. Live Up is more of a Kartel sounding gun toating tune than a Sizzla cut, but it's interesting to hear the 2 together and to hear Kartel on a simple one drop for a change. In terms of the best tune here completely, without a doubt, it's One Drop, a somewhat agressive knowledge tune that just gets better each time you listen to it. I'd also recommend the title track, Burn it Down and the crazy sounding Jah Knows.Overall, Brighter Day is a fun album. It never seems to take itself too serious which is a problem Sizzla records have suffered from in the past, and I can imagine the artist probably wrote it, recorded it and doubled it in an afternoon (there are some pretty good shots in the liner notes). Its pretty good, not as good as its more spiritual predeccessor, Speak of Jah, but good dancehall nevertheless. I don't think I should necessarily talk about how a year from now I'll probably be writing a review for the 3rd Kingston Records album which is about a 99.99998% chance for 2006, so I won't, instead I'll just recommend Brighter Day as a decent Sizzla album.

Jimmy Riley is a veteran Jamaican roots singer who made his name through recording with 60's groups, as a young singer, The Sensations and the Uniques. The Sensations were of the virtual run-of-the-mill type of groups to be found in Jamaica at the time. However, a great deal of Riley's fame and popularity was attained in singing for the legendary Uniques which included himself and (amongst others) Lloyd Charmers and the late Slim Smith. As a solo artist, Riley also gained attention by recording the MASSIVE Love & Devotion which, even to this day (and perhaps for the rest of his days), keeps him popular and in demand around the world.Fast forward to his son, a current work in process, the well indoctrinated and well prepared Tarrus Riley. Tarrus' style is not really anywhere near his father's in terms of being a pure singer, although he somewhat resembles his father's vocals when he does go the route of pure singer with a healthy and thunderous earthy type of singing. The style is somewhat similar to a MUCH more laid back Fantan Mojah who Tarrus sometimes sounds like in that he combines pure chanting with pure singing and even pure djaying.Parables is Tarrus' big league debut and he has come armed with a backing group that any established artist could hope for. Working the boards on Parables is none other than Dean Fraser. The legendary arranger/producer/saxman who has produced much material for artists such as Sizzla, Prince Malachi, Anthony B and most notably, Luciano. Parables starts from such a high place, just on paper alone and the album really lives up to the paper expectations.Check the title track! The title track is SUPREMELY clever track where Tarrus shows off his songwriting ability in connecting various folk tales and nursery rhymes with todays current happenings and problems. It takes a second to actually getting (and a visit to the dictionary to look up PARABLES) a grasp on the point of the song, but Parables is without a doubt one of the finest written reggae tunes you'll hear all year long!Equally as crucial is the opener, System Set (Willie Lynch Syndrome) a further explanation of Riley's writing style which is somewhat akin to a more and spiritual and religious version of what Tanya Stephens does in holding a vibe in a story type of mode which means every songs doesn't deviate and are all ABOUT SOMETHING. System Set goes rather nicely over the same riddim over which Luciano voice his epic Give Praise. Also check Micro Chip which is a song explaining the ills of modern society, most notably the internet (and I hope he approves of me giving his album a good review); check the MASSIVE One Two Order which is preceeded by a nice Rastafari Nyabinghi order chanting, Grounation style! One Two Order is a big big track definitely.I'm also quite fond of Africa Awaits, the only track here which I had previously heard from the Reflections riddim, one of the strongest tracks on the refashioned side of that once glorious riddim. Check the two combinations, most notably Family with Della Manley on a well powerful track, the other is a combination with songwriter Duane Stephenson (who wrote Jah Cure's MASSIVE True Reflections) on the song which is forever growing on me; and I'm also recommending Lion Paw. Lion Paw is the self affirming Rastafarian tune which this album needed, over a strong Nyah drum backed riddim (which is somewhat reminiscent of the Binghi Drum riddim of a few years back.All that being said. . . The best tune here is WITHOUT A DOUBT the John Legend remake Stay With You. The song is easily amongst the finest love anthems I've EVER heard and it might prove to be Tarrus' signature song. Showing throughout an album that his own pen is just as strong, I typically don't enjoy the remakes too much, but if you don't like Stay With You, then ignore the rest of this review!Overall, I'm not only stamping a well deserved seal of recommendation on Tarrus Riley's Parables, I'm also thinking about modifying my Best Reggae Albums of 2006 list to include it! The album was somewhat of a welcome surprise as before looking into it and researching it, I knew about it, but had very little interest in it. However, after wearing the disc out I can say definitely it is amongst the finest reggae releases of the year. Although, Tarrus Riley's name might not roll off the tongues of reggae fans as quickly as some of his peers, more material such as Parables (both the album and ESPECIALLY the song) it will only be a matter of time.

This is the first Reggae Gold album that I purchased and I would liken it to the reggae equivalent of the Now series. It has the big commercial songs on the big commercial rythms just thrown altogether. There are good songs here, its the only record that I know of that has Cecile's Changez on it, it also has Lady Saw on Son of A Bit@h, the remix of Girls Dem Sugar with Mya is here as well. Probably my favorite song here with the exception of Changez is Gimmi the Woman by Capleton, because his flow is so odd here, not just your typical Prophet, Baby Cham is here also on Man &amp; Man. The worse point here? All Out War by Bounty Killer because as VP Records does a lot of, the song is cut and censored, and its and incredible song if you leave it how it is, if you want the real deal get ragga ragga ragga 15! on Greensleeves. The other cd that comes with this is a megamix by Stonelove, which is almost totally wack. Get this album for Cecile and Cecile only, most of the rest of the songs can be found on better records.

I find myself more and more these days basically taking advantage of the fact that my collection of reggae music (and all Caribbean music for that matter) has now grown to an absolutely wonderful load. For the better part of the past half decade or so ALMOST ANYTHING which was scheduled to be released and was marked `reggae' in any way shape or form has arrived on my doorstep and while I definitely haven't kept all of it, I've amassed quite the personal catalogue for myself, one which is full of constant surprises. When I have gone searching through my archives under the guise of just looking `for something to listen to' recently I've been downright lucky with some of the gems I've come across which I originally neglected to spin through for some reason. For example, not too long ago there was an album by the name of Element Of Surprise from impressive singer Mykal Somer from out of St. Kitts that I found in my own closet, with it's original factory sealed wrap intact. Element Of Surprise was a pretty big album and I was literally thanking myself for my tastes back in 2003 (when it was originally released) for apparently having picked up a copy. Also, there is a fairly talented dancehall artist who I `re-ran' into in my own collection by the name of Honoureble whose debut album, Fire + Ice, I can remember always meaning to buy, and apparently I had at some point without actually recalling having done so AT ALL. Most commonly, I'll find rather nostalgic editions of VP Records' famed Riddim Driven series or Greensleeves' Rhythm Album series. There was a point in the earlier 2000's when these riddim albums were released at an astonishing rate (and in the case of Greensleeves at a ratio of approximately 3:1 when compared to actual artists' releases) and I would almost freely pick them up WHENEVER I encountered them, seemingly with my only condition to be met for purchase that I had not already purchased that particular installment (although I'd be lying if I said I had NO repeats, obviously having forgotten what I had and had not picked up). I've come across fresh and unopened copies of things like the X5 Riddim (which featured Lady Saw's WICKED Baddest Girl and Bounty Killer's scathing (albeit unnecessary) shot at Baby Cham and Dave Kelly, Just Dead), The Flip riddim and the Phantom Riddim as well, all from VP; and pieces like the Threat riddim album (check T.O.K's streamlined Where I'm From on that one) and the Jumbie, all of them finds occurring within the last year or so. I'll also occasionally find albums from some of my favourite artists that I just never really got around to spinning and that, of course, is the GEM.While I wouldn't necessarily call the particular album in question here an actual GEM, it is a term DEFINITELY applicable to its creator, he criminally underrated, but just as CONSISTENT Mikey General. In much the same fashion I seem to be treating singers like Chrisinti and especially Yami Bolo these days, I find myself really appreciating the General more and more these days (maybe I'm getting old!). Thus, I was downright overjoyed to be digging through crates of vinyl and CD's and stumble across this loooooong forgotten release from the General, Stronger Rastaman, which was originally released way back in 1995 (I was all of fourteen years old). General, much like his good friend and `spiritual brother' the very popular Messenjah, Luciano, were very early members of the Xterminator camp, headed by legendary producer, Phillip `Fattis' Burrell which, in terms of modern roots reggae, had definitely turned out to be one of the most storied labels on the landscape in its entirety. Quite a great deal of General's (and Luciano's) earlier work came produced at the hands of Xterminator, which means that (after awhile) they were afforded some of the most popular and simply well done riddims of the era, created by such people as Donald Dennis, Steven Stanley and the incomparable Dean Fraser. I have to definitely admit to my own personal bias as Xterminator is far and away one of my favourite labels; it was in it's heyday (the late 1990's) when I REALLY started paying more of an attention to roots reggae and now, having canvassed the era slightly before and been ALL through the subsequent time, I feel full on very confident saying that it was at the hands of Burrell and Fraser and Dennis and Stanley and definitely their fine stable of artists that MODERN roots reggae really began to take its shape and begin to become what we know it as today (big respect goes to Richard Bell at Star Trail as well definitely). The UK born General, alongside names like (Roaring) Lion, Prince Malachi, Congo Jesse and Shadowman make up the underrated and honestly somewhat forgotten members of the group, which is a shame as, although he is primarily known for his work with Luciano, you simply will not find too many artists AT ALL, not even veterans, who are overall as talented or have as great of a NATURAL FEEL for making roots reggae music. While his vibes tend not to ascend to the stratosphere where Luciano hangs out (speaking in terms of popularity) anyone with a halfway decent ear trained in roots reggae music can hear almost immediately that his abilities are not very far, if at all, behind those of his superstar friend. Stronger Rastaman is a very nice example of that as, despite what can perhaps be best described as it's lack of `flare' or `spice' its still a very very nice album from the General and one which roots heads, should they feel inclined to track it down, will almost certainly enjoy. By my count, Stronger Rastaman was the third album of Mikey General's career and his third for Xterminator (incidentally, Sinners, which I believe to be his first, is the exact same album as Stronger Rastaman with a varying track order) and for me personally, having the opportunity to listen through it was a very nice vibes, brought back some nice memories and actually taught me a few things as well under the `tent' of the knowledge that Mikey General just doesn't make bad music. Stronger Rastaman is no exception.Actually, this album predates my experience in listening to and enjoying Xterminator music. It was maybe a couple of years following it's release that I REALLY started paying attention to their vibes. Therefore, while there is definitely a bit in the riddims that I recognize, some of it is COMPLETELY new to me, which, of course, is a very nice thing to my ears. Getting things started on this very nice thing is the very nice tune Tired Of It. I swear I've been spinning this tune since I started writing this review (and incidentally, I'm still not tired of it) because its just a really LOVELY vibes. The song expresses itself in a historical and knowledge type of set and in the course gets the very powerful, and rather timely, message across that people are just tired after literally thousands of years of oppression. A very uplifting and uniting vibes and one of the best tunes on Stronger Rastaman definitely. Very nice opener. Next up is what is essentially the title track of the album, Rasta Have To Be Stronger. This tune carries another very heavy message (as is Mikey General's style) as on it, the General says that Rastafari and Africa itself will have to toughen up if we are assumed to make any kind of progress in a world which is constantly progressing with or without us knowing about it. It also, at least to my ears, raises the constant question of EXACTLY what is the place of Rastafari in the society, besides the stereotypical view of the singer making the music. VERY deep tune right there and definitely don't skip through it at all, take your time with it. Completing the opening to Mikey General's Stronger Rastaman album is the obligatory ode to the Black Queen's, the beautiful Woman Of Israel. The tune is almost PERFECTLY done by General. In fact, had you told me of such a tune from the artist I probably would have imagined something very similar to what Woman Of Israel turns out to be definitely. Its just the type of tune you've heard hundreds of times and will hear hundreds of more times, always necessary and always poignant, the same applies here, lovely vibes. Altogether a pretty nice, albeit an expected, start to the album.As I mentioned, Stronger Rastaman was released before I really began spinning Xterminator music. THUS, it was before I became exposed to the artist who I rate today as my favourite overall, Sizzla Kalonji. So I was wonderfully surprised to hear the tune Black & Comely on this album which features Mikey General alongside Sizzla himself and in the process (VERY UNSURPRISINGLY) scores to my tastes the finest outing on the album altogether. The tune finds what would have been a nineteen year old Sizzla well into the vibes which would ultimately make him a superstar and he and General come together to make a very memorable tune espousing on the virtues of Black unity and redemption. Definitely a BIG and EMPOWERING track and you really wouldn't have expected less from such a combination. Big tune. The General rides solo to deliver what is, in my opinion, Stronger Rastaman's second finest effort, the OUTSTANDING repatriation anthem, I'm Going Home. Until I got down to Black & Comely, I'm Going Home was my favourite tune here and even after I'm still LOVING IT! The song is just so richly sang and wonderfully performed by the General and, in retrospect, in kind of reminds me of Ras Attitude's big tune from 2007, Trodding Home. Always love to hear truly BIG tunes about HOME and that is exactly what comes through on I'm Going Home, indeed. I also took a keen interest in the tune Sinners (as apparently it was big enough for Fattis to name an entire album after it) and it is a very heavy track as well. Coming in over a SPARKLING one-drop Sinners was a tune I was actually quite familiar with having seen Mikey General perform it live several times actually so it was nice to finally be able to put a studio version with the big live tune I know so fondly. Much like Luciano, Mikey General is much more of a spiritual artist in that he typically draws spiritual or abstract imagery in his vibes, but dropped right near the middle of Stronger Rastaman are two very nice social commentaries, Deh Pon Dem and Many Have Fallen. Deh Pon Dem is the stronger of the two as the General speaks on the violence in the ghetto and SPECIFICALLY gets into a story telling type of situation which is actually far from his norm and ultimately is a very impressive twist of things there. For its part, Many Have Fallen is slightly less detailed than its predecessor, but comes in with a very `responsible' vibes as well and it is a social commentary with more than a dash of the spiritual which is a very nice mix. I do have to go back and mention the very nice tune I'll Never Be Ashamed which is more traditional Mikey General than the two tracks I just mentioned. You can sum up the tune with the most memorable lines from the tune as the General says, "I'll never be ashamed to Jah Jah name!". Definitely, of course I don't remember or know at this point, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if I'll Never Be Ashamed was a single from the album at all, it has a very nice sound which also encompasses what most listeners know Mikey General's music to be. As the album winds down it offers one of it's real highlights, the downright BRILLIANT New Name. New Name is a track which I could probably best describe as a `faith unifying' type of vibes. In it the General describes a chance meeting he had with a woman of a different walk of life than his own and while he was full on accepting of her thoughts she was very adamant in denying his and he uses the mantra of `new name' to signify that really and truly, we may all be looking for the SAME entity, regardless of what we call him/her. Big tune which very much was lost in the shuffle there. Stronger Rastaman closes with the decent changeup I'm Wondering, kind of a jilted lover's type of vibes. Its not one of the best tunes here AT ALL, but it kind of blends away at the end and is definitely forgivable.Overall, I really can't say anything negative about Mikey General's Stronger Rastaman. While it is definitely short on something to separate it from the pack (and many would argue, myself DEFINITELY not included that is a condition which strikes General himself as well), to my ears, it comes across as just a nice vibes and really every album doesn't have to be that BIG super album and you'll have far more albums like this than those. Stronger Rastaman also doesn't find the General at his absolute best (which is something you would hope would be the case for an album almost fourteen years old with a still active artist) but, again, his talent still comes across very nicely because of his overall FEEL for roots music. This album best serves a purpose for DEEP roots heads, particularly those spawned in the modern era. For you, like me, Stronger Rastaman while far from the best album you'll ever hear, is just a joy to listen to from Mikey General, one of the most underappreciated MASTERS of modern reggae music. Not at all bad for something I barely knew I even had.

Luciano kinda operates under a 'less is more' mantra of making music. Less in the actual music, not in the quantity, outside of anyone not named Sizzla or Culture, this guy puts out more albums than anyone making reggae music today. You don't sit around awed by his melodies or the riddims that he chooses, and you don't feel over-powered by his voice. What you do feel when you listen to a Luciano record is good. He just makes good music, and perhaps better so than anyone in reggae music, if you need someone to make you a really good song, you might do well to first seek out the Messenjah.Lessons of Life follows his big album of the year, VP's Serious Times and it more than holds its own, and is arguably better all around than that big budgeted superstar project. Where Serious Times is produced by the excellent Dean Fraser, the more than capable Fat Eyes helms Lessons of Life for Shanachie. The best tune here is the opener, Step Right In, gets the album off a very good note, and that level is maintained throughout the project never actually dipping much, if any at all. Besides the opener you also have the excellent Take A Sip and its remix featuring roots veteran the underappreciated Tony Rebel, also really like Real Rastaman with Louie Culture helping in. Buried on this album is track number 8 Roll Away. Roll Away is an excellent tune over a complicated Dean Fraser riddim, and its there where you best see Luciano's genius minimalist theory at work.Overall, Lessons of Life is an excellent project if you enjoy really good reggae music. Luciano of course rides the spiritual heavy Rastafari vibes, and he probably rides them better than anyone going today, having dropped two of the best albums of the year this summer, he's absolutely on an international high with some really good music coming out his camp. The cover probably tells the story of this one the best, Luciano just wants to sit around and play his music for people's enjoyment, and I don't hear anyone complaining.

I'm not much of a hip-hop head anymore, I primarily listen to dancehall and r&b, and the only reason that I bought this album was because I heard the hook on a song called Money Jane and it sounded a lot like Sean Paul. And it was. I gotta admit that this cd is not bad for me at all. Its straight rap most of the time, which I don't like, but the dancehall balance is kinda cool. Gotta little Capleton tie too talking about the Fire like he does.

Going back and taking a second look at alot of my reviews I saw that I had rated Lexxus' album as a 5, and it is surely not a 5 star album. In fact it is far from it. I give Lexxus his props, he can certainly ride a riddim (Look How Long, Call U, Ride for me and Divine Reasoning), however, because of his lyrical content (he really isn't saying too of anything) this album is just not very good.Consistently. In fact besides Look How Long, the first 14 cuts are absolutely nothing to write home about.Overall, I say you can certainly stand to pass on this one, and based on what Lexxus is currently doing, you could probably stand to pass on his forthcoming effort as well.

Monifah has some serious vocals, always has always will. But unfortunately she will probably be overlooked for her entire career. This cd is just great to listen to. If you like slow, relaxing r&b then it is truly a must have. This is Monifah's best work by far, with songs like Peaches & Cream, Fairytales and Brown Eyes being the best on the cd. While making respectable appearances on several albums recently from Profyle's Nothin But Drama to Mad Cobra's Cobra, Monifah easily managed to crank out her best work with Home.

I bought this cd because I was bored and feeling a little experimental. Also because being a long time fan of Monifah, I was interested in what she would sound like with the group. The first half of this album is great, its so great that it makes you forget almost entirely about the mediocre second half. Best songs are Nasty, Liar Liar, and M.A.K.E.L.U.V. Not to shabby.

If you spend anytime in the reggae section of your favorite music store (or music site) you have probably come to notice that (especially in the last 10 years or so) the racks are full on exploding with dozens and dozens of compilations from dozens and dozens of different companies. It is seemingly the mission of every new reggae company to almost immediately get a their very own compilation series going (that would be the second step after first releasing a Sizzla album). Even myself, I recently began my own label and. . . we almost immediately went to work on building a compilation album. Thus, I hold compilations to a greater standard than most artist's albums, you have to full on come out with something spectacular each time just to catch my eye.The UK based Jet Star is the company responsible for the Reggae Hits series which reaches its 35t installment here. I typically compare the RH series to VP Records' Reggae Gold series in that they try very hard to give you a mix of new music and at the sametime promote their own artist's and releases.This edition is no different at all and this edition suffers from the main problem as most compilations: It includes many of the same tunes as previously released (and better quality) compilations. I don know about you, but, although it's a big tune, seeing Richie Spice's now 3 year old 'The Way You Are Living' (aka Folly Living, aka Blood Again) on a 2006 compilation does nothing for me. Same thing for Norris Man's (awesome) Home & Away, Gyptian's (magnificent) over played Serious Time and Jah Cure's (still the best tune here) amazing Love Is. They've all been on countless compilations, will continue to be and its a matter of 'been there, done that'. (And throw in Anthony Cruz and Buju Banton's combination Too Bloody, that's a quarter of the album, retreads)RH#35 also suffers from the inclusion of several sub-par tunes. Voicemail's Memories by the score is just bad, as is Macka Diamond and Lady G's combination I Want a Man, Capleton's Gimmi Little Bit is odd, and both vets Lloyd Brown and Don Campbell fail to hit the mark on their Slow Wine and Unchain Us respectively. Elephant's Sesame Street is. . . annoying- Only topped by the AWEFULLY annoying Ring Ding Ding by LOC which is annoying in sound and in the terrible way that Jet Star pounded the tune down the throats of its fans.So, after all that, what's good here? The opener is almost magical. Mikey Spice taps the excellent love tune Happy Hour on one of his best offerings in a long time. The aforementioned Love Is by Jah Cure is tired, but I will never tire of hearing the tune and on any album which it appears, its the best tune, no difference here. George Nooks adaptation of the standard Love Lifted Me is very very fine. Hearing a 12 year old (or however old he is!)doing a roots tune is always different and QQ's Poverty, although kind of annoying, is a welcome addition. Turbulence's Nah Sell Out is probably the real reggae selling point here, its the first single off his new album (same title) from Jet Star, and its a very very fine tune. Even Sean Paul with female Stacious do a decent cut of the stalag on Dream. And Kevin Lyttle and Beenie do a decent piece on Dancehall Champion.My 'favorite' (not the best) tune here however, is the infectious Lucky You by Nanko. Lucky You is an almost suicidal rant of a seriously depressed sounding young man, but the tune works on every level, very very impressive tune, which is older in JA but hasn't yet made the compilation rounds (same thing with QQ's Poverty).Jet Star also includes 6 video's from the album. Of course, check Lucky You, and although the tune is bad, Lady G is still cute after all these years!Overall, I rated this album right in the middle, I imagine, however, that most fans aren't like me, in that you'll actually have the 5 other compilations on which some of these tunes appear. So, if you haven't been watching the reggae compilations then you'll probably enjoy Reggae Hits 35 a lot more than I do, and in that case alone, I'll reccommend it.

Its Strictly the Best time again! Each and every year I find myself most looking forward to seeing the StB compilation, moreso than perhaps any compilation VP Records Produces outside of Soca Gold. The mixture of tunes is always a tad bit deeper than what you'll find on the more marketable and mainstream Reggae Gold from the summer and they typically rely less on pushing their own artists and more on pushing good reggae music (thus the name). But easily, the best feature of StB (outside of the always MARVELOUS packaging) is that it comes in 2's. Nearly every year (since I've followed it) you'll get one higher powered dancehall comp. and one smoother roots and lover's rock version.2006 is no different and again, not surprisingly, the softer more mellow of the two takes the prize of being the better album. Besides comparing it to its sister album, StB#36 is just GOOD! Its a very very solid album on its own merits, boasting some of the finer roots and lover's artists on the scene today, and boosted by one of the strongest years for roots in recent history.So strong is it that I won't even complain (that much) of VP pushing their own artists EXTREMELY hard this year.Another interesting aspect of #36 is the mix between established and unestablished talents on the project, track ten, Old Skool Love remix even features an artist, in Divine Brown who isn't a strictly reggae artist, but with a reggae remix of her very fine tune. And continuing on that vibe, StB#36 is packed well powerful in female representation of the young female artists. The young first lady of th Element, Etana comes WICKED on her shatteringly beautiful Wrong Address; Cherine Anderson from One Love fame steps nicely with her Good Love and pulling a double duty with Chuck Fender on the nice Coming Over Tonite. Topping them all however, is of course the divine and ANGELLIC Alaine on her wonderful Deeper, which also happens to be my choice for best song on the album (now what really would have been nice if VP could have gotten the Lovesounds combination with Beres Hammond, but hopefully they're keeping that for his next album. . . or her first?)VP once again turns to the proven but underappreciated Bitty Mclean for one of the finest pieces on the album, the brilliant Real Thing finds Mclean typically capturing a forgotten era of lovers rock magnificence. Also check the nice nice On My Mind which was a fairly big hit down here not too long ago, just a nice vibes song. And VP talents Wayne Wonder, Richie Spice and Gyptian all represent well on their respective songs, with Richie Spice's divine Brown Skin coming out the finest of the 3.Really the only song here that I have a problem with is the now nearly 3 year old (and WELL promoted Life Seeds by I-Wayne), but that is cancelled out by the MAMMOTH Stay With You by Tarrus Riley from his new album Parables. Stay With You may be the best love song I've heard this year period! That song is completely gorgeous, with a well powerful message, and if you see a review from me for his new album in the next few days, rest assured it was the main factor influencing my decision to purchase it.Overall, I'm giving StB#36 a well earned stamp of recommendation, I would even call it better than last year's #34, as it has more top class material. Always happy to see the young talent represented, particularly the young female talent, and it is just a joy to listen to.

There's a generation of Americans aged 22-25 that were too young to really hear and love Bob Marley's music, that didn't necessarily like what the Shabba Ranks' and Mad Cobra's of the world were doing (myself not included, big Cobra fan)that first heard and loved reggae music from Buju Banton. 'Til Shiloh was one of the greatest albums ever made, will always be one of the greatest albums ever made, and it established his legend in international music. And today he stands as unarguably the most appreciated living artist in reggae music today.On his spanking new album Friends for Life, he continues what he's been doing for what seems like an eternity, despite still not seeing his 30th birthday yet. Absolutely and easily the best tune on this album (and there are some very good ones) is Up Ye Mighty Race, the song is very powerful, its lyrically almost perfect. After that, you get some very high classed combinations, as Buju reunites with some former sparring partners to produce some high quality tunes. High powered Wayne Wonder does the honors on the excellent Get It On, Queen Nadine Sutherland provides the haunting vocals on the flavorable What Am I Gonna Do?, and of course the Legend Beres Hammond on Good Times, which also features labelmate Fat Joe, and is surprisingly good (despite Fat Joe's attempt at a Jamaican accent early in his verse). Also joining Gargamel is the normally stone voiced Bounty Killer despite dissing Buju several times in the last few years apparently for no reason, on the gal tune Teaser, on which Bounty lightens his flow, and it honestly is a very good dancehall tune. Other good tunes include the excellent put down the guns anthem Mr. Nine, the title track, a nice r&b; tinged tune, Paid Not Played is very good as well, Buju's take on the riddim deity Diwali Tra La La, Feeling Groovy a ska song, and the excellent Maybe We Are. I could go on and on, the only tune i do not like is Damn which is the prerequisite hip-hop tune and the one that i hope they dont turn into a video, also check the beautiful Mama Africa and All Will Be Fine.Overall, i say of course get this one, i haven't heard a lot of Buju's recent work (he hasnt had alot of recent work) but this one certainly makes up for it. And listening to him i see where he influenced a lot of the younger artists in what they are doing today, like Sizzla (my favorite artist), Anthony B, even the not so young Capleton and Junior Kelly, and even i should say Tony Rebel and his peers like Bounty Killer. And Up Ye Mighty Race is the best song i've heard in a looooooooooong time. GO GET IT !

Hard to believe it was just 2 years ago when Kevin Roberts, better known as Natty King started locking down the charts in Jamaica. His MASSIVE No Guns To Town was #1 for about forever and it was almost immediately followed by the huge Mr. Greedy, and here in the second quarter of 2005, we get his debut album, an album which could have been rushed and done in a hurry, however, with the 2 years of additional 'seasoning' Natty King comes in just right on his well packaged and conceived debut album, No Guns to Town.While Natty King will continue, perhaps for the rest of his career, to list reggae singer Luciano as his main influence, his style is more derivative of Bushman's. Just like the Medicine Man, King's lyrics are more tangible, he doesn't sing about moods and sweet feelings as does the great Luciano. Even the ever so slight vocal difference which keeps people from eternally confusing Bushman for Luciano is evident in King's, his voice is harsher and heavier and completely perfect for the type of music he makes.Another thing is what in the world is in the water in St. Thomas? Not only does Bushman and Natty King hail from the eastern Parish of Jamaica, but Morgan Heritage and similarly underestimated singer Prince Theo as well, and had I known this I would've begged and begged my mother to move us!No Guns to Town is a big album. Not only because its a very anticipated project, but the music is just good! The best tune, besides the obligatory title track, is probably Love Me, incidentally, the one time when King really does just sing from a vibe, the most natural of all, love. Also love the straight to the point When the Money Done, Easy Officer (which is huge!) and High High. Of course Mister Greedy is a big tune, but when you really start listening to the album you don't really get the full effect. I purchased a pre-release and its taken awhile to grow on me (probably because I had been beaten myself over the head with sooooooooo much Bushman and Prince Theo music that I needed a St. Thomas singer break!) but when it does hit you, you'll recognize tunes like Environmentalist, Rainy Time and St. Thomas, Natty King's paying homage to his homeland. The big combination is Thunder a Roll with an overanimated Sizzla doing a verse which fans who have entirely too many Kalonji albums will recognize from somewhere on which they can't quite put their finger. The entire album has a somewhat of an old school Rasta feel and that was obviously intended and a wonderful touch.Overall, you look at 2005 as a whole and see the big albums out and sure to come, the cream of the crop might end up being Natty King's No Guns to Town. The album is beautifully packaged, and even comes as a double disc with the second being the videos for the title track and Mister Greedy. And the man is clutching a copy of The Philosophies and Opinions of Marcus Garvey which is mandatory reading. No Guns to Town is nearly mandatory listening, keep both eyes on Natty King!

Musically speaking, Anthony B's latest album on the street, Confused Times is one of his better albums, and that's saying a lot for an artist who routinely goes about 2-3 deep a year. No he's not as bad as Sizzla, Luciano and Turbulence, but Anthony B's been a very busy Bobo on the album circuit.Confused Times is much more of a harder edge than more recent albums such as the wonderful Black Star. It has some intense highlights and only one or two sore spots (such as the odd chorus on Push and the ridiculously disco saturated sound of Can't Take My Eyes Off You, a combination with sickly voiced Shocking Vibes singer Ghost) and at the end of it you come away pretty satisfied as a fan of the artist.The best tune here is probably the sharp Simple Something, just a very focused Anthony B over a hardcore dancehall riddim working marvelously ("Mi no laugh show dimple, smile show pimple, fugitive lak Richard Kimble"). Also check the aimed (at those not so popular amongst Rastas) Jamaica (which i confess I actually really like, so what you will when you hear it). Also love Rasta a combination with an unknown songstress which works well under the typical she-prefers-a-Natty type of vibe, nice tune. Also like the title track and Lock It Up.Again, this is only musically speaking, but when you hear the track Never Give it Up, you'll find one of the most appealing reasons to listen to Confused Times. The song is actually a combination between Anthony B, Turbulence and Bushman (I'm assuming because of the singer's mannerisms, but it could be Luciano or Natty King for that matter, if you know their styles you know exactly what I mean). It is a big big tune and easiy one of the album's best.Of course you wouldn't know that by looking at the tracklist or the liner notes. Why not? Because its a Penitentiary Records release. The same company who unashamedly, early this year released the same album twice, Sizzla's Burning Fire, once with all older tracks on it from older albums and the 'correction' with just 4-5 tracks on it from older albums. (Ohhhhhh way to go Penitentiary) Confused Times' tracklist is confused:The album is even programmed with the incorrect tracklist, so tracks 1-5 are actuallyLock it UpPushScreamCant Take My Eyes Off You (featuring Ghost)No Surrender, No RetreatTracks 11-15 are actuallyNever Give It Up (ft. Turbulence & Bushman)Moment Been Waiting ForRastaDem BunMoment Been Waiting For (hip-hop remix)And of course the geniuses at Penitentiary give the only writing credit to producer Kemar Mcgregor, think Anthony B might have a problem with giving a producer credit for his lyrics? So do I.So again, musically speaking, no problem here, Anthony B and whoever produced it (probably McGregor) did their job fine, Penitentiary just had a confused time putting it all together.Overall, nice vibes throughout threatened to be ruined by shady project management and shady operations from a record label who just honestly does not deserve the vibes of such great artists that they release, shame on Penitentiary, biggups to Anthony B.

Almost rather shamefully I find myself reviewing this album nearly a year and a half after its release date, despite the fact that I have been listening to it the entire time and perhaps even more shamefully, actually enjoying it. Call it my #1 dancehall guilty pleasure, but ever since the Diwali blew up so hot it had my cat dancing when I played it, I find myself almost immediately interested the second Lenky drops a new riddim.And they all haven't been too great or even very successful: The Dreamweaver, although very interesting was pretty much a flop. . . come to think of it, now that its over 2 years old, the Bubble Up didn't do much business either! But they are always interesting as Lenky seems to focus mostly on the 'dance' in dancehall and when one of these reaches an album (and one hasn't since this one) I'm one of the first customers picking it up.Its all very shameful.However, you may not be alive if one of his pieces can't get you moving in one way or another and since the Diwali, they all have been fairly similar. Either they involve that crazy tempo of the Diwali or they'll actually go as far as to incorporate the now notorious hand claps which made it so popular. The Bubble Up goes for a pace distinction and runs its 16 artists through the paces and does so in the typical Lenky fashion.What's nice about this album and all of his version albums is that the riddim will routinely change during the course of the album. It may be the same for one or two artists here and there, but Lenky will add a small change or a big change over the base riddim and thus giving each and every tune its own identity apart from the others on the same riddim.The best tune here is without a doubt God Bless by Assassin. Its a very very big tune which surprisingly missed his debut album (surprising because Lenky used to be inhouse musician and arranger for Penthouse which is where 'Sassin resides) and the surprisingly conscious tune works over a riddim which doesn't exactly bleed consciousness. Also love the criminally underrated and Lenky favorite Degree on It Deh Yah which didn't miss his last album at all and was one of the stronger tracks off of The General album.Also check Elephant Man's It Sweet Me, on which Ele stays on course and delivers a nice level headed piece (seeing how he doesnt try to get hyper, his natural levels will match this crazy riddim easily); check oft-forgotten singer Chico who often seems mind melded to Lenky's riddims on the very nice Change Your Ways; I even like Lenky's own artist Nicky B who is afforded one of the better mixes of the Bubble Up a string intensive nice mix; and of course as is the tradition on his albums, the producer's own clean mix of the riddim is highly entertaining and one of the finest tracks on the album.What's messed up here is the artist selection, both Danny English (who is afforded probably the best mix on the album) on Michelle and Wayne Marshall (who goes out of his way to flop his tune with the odd flow) on No Man Curse offer up pretty below average tunes. The same can be said for Bling Dawg's Aint Scared, to a less degree however, because this is pretty much status-quo for the ultra mediocre Bling Dawg.Overall, I'm a fan, take that into consideration while reading this review and observing the rather generous 4 star review that I gave it. Undoubtedly some of these tracks would be better sans the particular vocalist. It gets my recommendation to you, if and only if you're a fan, in of the producer, in which case, its been 18 months: What took you so long?

1st amongst the many strange things about this album is its title. What is popso? Popso is the exceedingly popular form of music which combines elements of pure American r&b; with pure American pop and pure Caribbean Soca. If you're not a soca head then you probably won't know the difference at all and just appreciate this r&b; sound with a Caribbean touch. People such as Rupee, Edwin Yearwood and especially Popso posterboy Kevin Lyttle have made a market for this type of sound and VP, ever attentive has made the first pure Popsonian (is that a word now?) record and as it says "Vol. 1", expect another one next year.Popso can be described as a cool sidekick of the massive Soca Gold series, Soca's answer to Reggae's Strictly the Best serie. Except this time the sidekick has more of the mainstream appeal and the leader will appeal more to the aficionado (it's vice versa with the Reggae Gold-Strictly the Best series).For my own personal taste, while I'm not the most learned Soca head, I do appreciate the sounds of the heavy soca vibe, with the heavy horns and whistles and the road march bashment sound. It is present here in spurts, but thats not the real attraction here. What is most striking about Popso is that it is entirely too addictive. Normaly when you say that, the album is usually a pure winner, not the case for Popso unfortunately. The vibes here are many but many of them miss the mark.The goodness of the album is with Wine and Bend Over from Saucy Wow Denise Belfon, Statement's laid back Wanna Be, of course Rupee's wildly popular Tempted to Touch and Best in Me, a good combination between Edwin Yearwood and dancehall dj Lex and hard soca ace sound oddly effective over a laid back pure popso riddim (which appears more than once here). I also love the heavier feel of 3 Suns (a favorite of mind) These Girls. And Da Bhann's truly wonderful My Love, the best song on the album.Another song here, by big time Shurwayne Winchester, is Got to Know, a ridiculously addictive piece which i dont particularly like, but can quite happily keep on repeat for about an hour without tiring of it. And even stranger song is Diana Joseph's 'counteraction' of Lyttle's megahit Turn Me On on U Got Me Wrong (which Lyttle co-wrote).Overall, this one ain't for the soca heads out there, you will be the kind of irritated that i found myself feeling during this record about halfway through. It is completely interesting however, and should it ever be 'leaked' to the mainstream public, expect about 10 big summertime hits.

You can pretty much bet on the fact that every couple of years or so the 'young veteran' Baby Cham will disappear for awhile only to resurface over some top notch riddim that will probably go #1. Thus, despite still being rather new in terms of the number of tunes he's recorded, he's had more comebacks at this point in his career than Mike Tyson.There are several artists (particularly in dancehall) who do this and there constant returns are not met with as much fanfare as Cham's. That's probably because Cham is armed with probably the most dominant and influential d'hall producers of all time in Dave Kelly as his producer and his mentor. When the 2 hookup, the results can be downright outstanding, and Kelly has, for years, been promising that Cham would someday crossover.Meet 'crossover' which comes in the form of a modern dancehall classic over an old sounding riddim which has become one of the biggest of all time. The 85 riddim has revolutionized Baby Cham's career and the #1 Ghetto Story over it is why. The song hit soooooooo huge that, while signed to a major off of the strength of his previous hit Vitamin S, also here, Ghetto Strength made it mandatory that his album be released and no longer relegated to 'coming soon' status, and coming off the heels of the boomshot that Welcome to Jamrock by Jr Gong, the not too disimilar vibe that is Ghetto Story found a huge audience overseas in the states.The album is fairly typical Baby Cham however, and ultimately that is what will be the main point here. Luckily all the talent at Madhouse doesn't belong to Kelly and the dj himself has a flow to match some of the best in the business. The best song here is without a doubt Ghetto Story, the addictive 85 riddim will keep that one in dj booths for decades probably. But you also have to definitely check the awesome second single (in JA) Dont Test Me. The song is pure Cham at his finest, the half rock-stone dj style, half mumble is the same style which brought him to fame on such tunes as Boom Tune, Gallang Yah Gal and Man & Man. Done over a fiesta riddim sounding vibe, the song works on sooooooo many levels.I, as a fan, was also happy that they included previous hits Vitamin S (which would have been the main selling point on this had it come out when originally scheduled) over the fiest riddim and the now 3 year old Bun Bad Mind, still as hot as the day it was released, never get tired of that one (WOULD HAVE LOOOOOOVED TO SEE THE RETURN this one however).Also check Boom Boom, a combination with Bajan star Rihanna which i was sure I wouldn't like but has grown on me completely; the ultra creative Cham in typical dancehall bragadocious stylee; and one of my favorites here, Love it Like That. That song took a couple of rotations to grow on me, however, now that I have it gets at least 5 spins before I flip to another track! Love It Like That is typical gyal tune (with a female singer, credited as Triniti) but its over that simplistic Madhouse production and it works! And I definitely reccomend what is credited as the sequel to Ghetto Story, Rudebwoy Pledge which sounds rather odd with its 45 second intro, however when it gets going its nearly as impressive as its predecessor.What's bad here? Well the sog Fat Punanny is about as close to hip hop as this one gets and its pretty bad. But besides just the one tune, oddly enough Ghetto Story seems bent on making the listener tired of Ghetto Story. The song appears in 3 different renditions, all backed by the 85 riddim, trading no featured artist for first Alicia Keys and then Akon, and if that isn't enough Ghetto Story for you, then there's also the video! So i'd reccomend that you REALLY like the tune before you check this one out.Overall, the concern with crossover albums like these when it comes to reggae, for the reggae listener, is exactly how much crossover material will there be? There is virtually none here and this one will satisfy the dancehall heads out there (like me). The fan who picks it up because they really liked the first single, never fear! There is more than enough Ghetto Story to go around here. Make sure you take it all in though, after it dies down, Baby Cham and Dave Kelly will soon retreat again to the batcave to begin working on the next masterpiece.

It was nearly thirteen years ago when one of the greatest sons in the deep history of reggae music lost his life tragically in a fire at his home. Garnett Silk was just 28 years old and seemed poised to potentially return roots reggae music to the once dominant status it had once maintained both in Jamaica and abroad. Many had even saw fit to deem the Manchester native the next Bob Marley and many international labels had shown a grand interest in the singer whose music had made him quite simply one of the most popular and one of the most powerful people on the island. Although Silk's time at the top was very very brief, he made a contribution to which reggae music is still rather indirectly pay homage, as was the case with Marley before him, Silk's death almost immediately led to the `search' for the next Garnett Silk. While his place as the dominant roots reggae singer has fallen into the well capable hands of fellow Manchester native Luciano, who I'm sure Silk would be happy with as he has taken the role and not only become a great artist, great performer and great overall ambassador for reggae music but has become somewhat of the roots conscience of all of reggae; establishing a reputation for class and decency all throughout the music. There have been others still, Everton Blender, one of Silk's best friends has remained an active and very popular roots singer throughout his career and then names such as Jr. Reid, Mykal Rose, Prince Malachi and Jahmali have come and achieved a great deal of respect both locally and internationally. The currently emerging generation of young singers however, have shown the greatest results of Silk's efforts as many of them not only carry some of the same traits of the fallen singer, but list him as one of the most inspiring figures in their careers. Obviously true, should a singer of an age 20-30 emerge now, he spent at least the first half of his childhood listening to Garnett Silk's music. Thus, names like Warrior King, I-Wayne and Gyptian now coming to prominence is indirectly a large up to Silk, and all hold such a righteous stature that the late singer would definitely be proud (and the beautiful beautiful combinations we could have were Mr Silk still around physically!). With the current lovely swing towards the more rootical side of reggae becoming just as popular as its dancehall side both locally and in foreign, expect to see many more championing the vibes of Garnett Silk.My choice to fill that role is definitely I-Wayne. Silk's style was definitely far ahead of his time and even still he made such a great impact. The same could perhaps be said for the slight Portmore native who words and actions since breaking through have seemed downright strange at times, and although he is far more hot tempered than Silk was, he sings a style of militant roots which not only demands respect, but expects it, yet at the same time is able to fall back and sing a killing lovers tune or simple track at any time. For Warrior King's case, his style right now actually is quite akin to Silk (and that track! With King and Silk with a chanter, say Fantan Mojah, would have been a blessing!) and young Gyptian still has so far to go before what he truly is has been revealed to the masses but he'll certainly, later in his career, have the opportunity to be reggae's leading singer. However, all of that being said, without a doubt the man who has taken the actual vibes of Garnett Silk and built his career around them as his foundation is the NYC born and based Ras Shiloh. The singer, who'll chant it from the highest mountain given the opportunity that he is inspired by Silk, has a rather unusual place within the reggae community. Throughout his career, Ras Shiloh has taken long periods of inactivity (at least in terms of being on the radio and play lists in Jamaica), even still, his popularity has yet to wane even in the slightest degrees and he is routinely present on some of the larger cultural shows on the island and his big big tunes (of course most notably Are You Satisfied) are appreciated as strongly as ever.Shiloh's style is simply Garnett Silk's style and its most interesting because all the combinations and songs Silk might have made or could have made, we have Shiloh toiling along his way, making a big name and creating the same vibes we may have heard from Silk himself. I can't count how many times I've played a Shiloh song for a friend or an acquaintance only to get the response, "You have new Silk?", not only the styles but the way they both carry themselves are very similar. While Shiloh hasn't garnered on the many of the praise which was shown to Silk, he hasn't exactly been the odd man out. Along with Chuck Fender over the past half decade probably no foreign born artist has received more laude than has Shiloh, being definitely respected amongst fans and people in the industry as well. To date, he has been a favourite of Penthouse head Donovan Germain (who also favoured Jahmali and has worked with Warrior King as well), one of the legendary producers, particularly in the dancehall arena, but the two have come together to push some of the highest quality material anyone has ever heard from Shiloh. His previous album, that downright MASSIVE From Rasta to You came from Penthouse Studios to fine fine acclaim, however, it was 2002 when that album dropped, and despite being one of his most popular to date (and his third overall) it would be five years before Shiloh would give us another.Enter Coming Home. With, surprisingly, the production here being done by the equally legendary (perhaps even more so) Bobby Digital. The pair, on paper at least, seems a winning one as Digital brings nothing less than two epic Sizzla albums (Da Real Thing and of course the perfect Black Woman & Child) highlighting his roots catalog (even though Calibud did most of the work) and armed with a vault full of roots riddims, the two should do quite well. Coming Home is a wonderfully executed album which easily shoots to the head of the class as one of the, if not THE best reggae album of 2007 so far. Its almost frustrating, considering the level of album that was From Rasta to You a half decade ago and now picking up here, there should have been two more nice Shiloh albums on the shelves for the masses, and yet Coming Home was well well worth the wait. The completely roots set is a wonderful gem of modern roots and from beginning to end never misses a beat and never fails on one of its sixteen selections. Shiloh himself has not changed much in the time apparently, his voice is still as strong and yet just as far from overbearing as ever, channeling, nearly directly the spirit of Garnett Silk through his vibes, and I'd go as far as to say that he has even outdone himself from the From Rasta to You album as Coming Home is just as consistent, but offers even more in terms of spectacular material at the top. As a point maker, just plop the cd in and press play, the first song you'll hear, We Need More Love is easily amongst the album's finest and gets Coming Home set off on a wonderful foot and the rest of the album even still holds true to those vibes.Somewhere in the middle of Coming Home you might lose your point, however, as most great roots pieces, it has somewhat of a lover's feel to it and while it certainly is nowhere near dancehall, the most seasoned of soundmen could definitely find a place for it in any dance, it truly covers the lover's area finely, without even trying. Perhaps that is due to Shiloh noticeable improvement in certain areas. While not much has changed in the half decade since we last hear from him, Ras Shiloh has definitely become a more complete writer and that's not to say that he was poor at the skill from before, but Coming Home shows that he was completely focused on putting forth his best effort and there are some nice nice meditations on the album. I'd go as far as to say that he joins the upper echelons as far as writers as singers go, joining the likes of Luciano, I-Wayne and even Jah Cure now with this effort. As usual, he reaches no tough spots with his vocals, despite having Silk's very unusual vocalizing style (which even comes off as vocoder effect at times but definitely is not) his voice has an underlying strength and substance to it which not many other singers can claim.Among biggest things about Coming Home are the several very well done combinations Ras Shiloh has. The first, Let the People Voice Be Heard with Morgan Heritage is one of the best as it works on absolutely every level, and Shiloh more than holds his own with the group. Aside from the combination aspect, it is amongst the album's best overall as well. The second combination is a bit more unusual as it features Shiloh with Portmore chanter Bascom X on the excellent New Rising Day. The song took a minute to grow on me, despite being backed with one of the strongest and most lovely one drops Coming Home has to offer and being one of the songs here that just hit a spot in you and make you feel good, its very lovely vibe the unlikely pair creates on the tune (now if VP just kept Bascom in studio and pulled an album from him, wouldn't that be nice for later this year). The final combination on Coming Home and the one which I'm calling the best is It Will Be Over with man of the moment, Guyanese chanter Natural Black. The song actually reminds me slightly of the MASSIVE tune Nuh Build Great Men from Fantan Mojah and Jah Cure and it works completely! Definitely one of the album's best offerings and actually nice since Black is flooding the place with nice albums and this is a combination that is best appreciated on this album.When Shiloh takes off on his own for the balance of the album he definitely does himself proud with all tunes having fight for second when compared to the absolutely MAMMOTH Volume of the Book. Volume of the Book sounds directly like something Silk himself may have sung in his time, and wherever he is, be sure he has the tune playing on his racks (and I'm sure he has playing the divine Rastaman in the Hills, a HUGE track from Shiloh which wasn't included here shockingly). Volume of the Book is huge and for all roots fans definitely something you need to hear, and does nicely as one of the more uptempo and vibrant tunes here, Shiloh shows his absolute best on the tune. Also, as it directly proceeds It Will Be Over, it makes for one of the best stretches of tracks on the album. Following those two tracks still is the excellent Rebel With a Cause which channels an older Shiloh vibe with using `Babylon Yuh Doom' as a punch line at times. Again, the track is one of the songs that just make you feel good through it, definitely one of the biggest vibes overall.Check Shiloh's take on the lovely Come Down Jah Jah. The song, I love in just about any form (most famously to my knowledge it was done by Luciano) and it is just a wonderful song, definitely one suiting to Shiloh's style of making music. Check the closer All of Me, in a pure lover's style of a classic riddim, makes you want to grab your woman by the waist and hit the hit the dance floor but very nice and easy, and Shiloh, again very lyrically strong, paints a very nice picture on the tune. Check the downright excellent What Have You Done, catch a very nice vibes from that one over the very Marley-esque riddim, but even still, is a very nice song on its own merits. And lastly you definitely need to check Ah What a Gwan, probably the best pure conscious track on Coming Home altogether.Overall, Coming Home is one of the two best reggae albums I've heard all year (with the other being Tony Rebel's I-Rebel), yes its that strong, had it come last year, it might have even given the epochal Phantom War by Lutan Fyah a run for its money, Coming Home is HUGE! Recommended to all established roots fans and of course fans of Shiloh who probably woke up this morning and headed out to pick this one up. Newer fans, don't even approach it, picking up From Rasta to You or one of Shiloh's earlier albums will make this one even more open to your ears. But when you reach the level of becoming a fan, by all means pick this one up. MASSIVE! GO GET IT!

Just three years down the line from it's original release and one of the most profound reggae albums of the last 20 years is re-released. It's cleaned up, its giving a new more attractive packaging and a DVD is thrown in to boot.Da Real Thing, originally, served to drop a massive bomb on critics who were accusing Sizzla Kalonji of having forgotten his more spiritual and melodic roots and replaced them with the hyperactive, rough and often slack edges which he had been displaying in recent years. DRT brought back the Sizzla that was birthed on such pieces as Black Woman & Child, Praise Ye Jah and Royal Son of Ethiopia and set it to the critics that the Sizzla they thought was lost was alive and well.Musically, the re-release offers the same 15 tracks as the original, however, the addition of 3 live tunes, including a very very wicked tune called Be Still and an acoustic version of Just One of Those Days. You probably know all of these tunes however, and probably dont need me telling you that the best tune is Thank U Mamma and that songs like Simplicity, Solid As a Rock and Just One of Those Days are amongst the artist's best.The attraction here for the collectors, who will eat this one up, is a loaded dvd, complete with 2 different interviews with the artist (one of which, for the BBC, is so massive that its cut in 99 sections), video releases of both Thank U Mamma and Stage Show, the first single from Sizzla's most recent VP release Stay Focus. The real highlight of the DVD, however, is of course the monstrous performance from VP's Miami show in which the artist appears in fine form, blowing through such hits as Taking Over, Humble Thought,Karate, Holding Firm and finishing appropriately with Thank U Mamma. Shown in great film and with fantastic audio watching the show, particularly the audiences responses is exciting.Overall, I dont see the average Kalonji fan dropping everything to run out and buy an album they certainly already bought for just a few enhancements, but this one is for the collectors! Now, were you one of the few that didnt purchase the original (and good luck finding with this one on the shelves now) then atone for your misdoings, DRT is massive and one of the artist's best, and the upgrade is a surprisingly welcomed touch.

Each and every time I hear a new riddim from the King Jammy's camp, I get more and more impressed. Besides resting on the laurels of family patriarch King Jammy himself, the extended family, in the form of John John, CJ, Baby G (who is, to date, the only of the legendary producer's tribe to turn vocalist) , and Jam2 (and I'm SURE there are a few others). In preference, I've always favored Jam2's vibes better. Jam2 will typically build a BIG sounding hardcore dancehall riddim with a twist. From the Engine which he built with his brother, through the WONDERFUL Amharic and most recently in 2006, the Sidewalk University. He always manages to put out a seriously wicked riddim for the dancehall and actually, for one of the very few younger producers, Jam2 exercises fantastic artist choice for his riddims, even amongst the newer and un-established talent he voices, the artists always seem made for the riddim and rarely do you get the `fish out of water' vibe from one of his tunes (and that's saying something because both the Sidewalk University and the Amharic had some crazy twists).Mixed in there somewhere and flying under my radar apparently (I think I must've been in the shower or something) is the sickly high powered Nookie. The Nookie is simply one of the coolest riddims I've ever heard! Its not big like the Engine was, it has its own type of vibe while still maintaining its hardcore base, but its so wonderfully crafted and built that the result is a well functioning well oiled machine of a riddim which goes to back some of the finest hardcore dancehall talents available in Jamaica.Typically on a riddim album, I like to look at who actually produced the riddim, and what they have done previously; I like to look at the artist selection, which almost always tells you who produced the riddim (certain producers lovvvvvvvvvvvve voicing certain artists, which is how we get such pairs as Vybz Kartel and producer Vendetta and Bounty Killa and King Jammy despite the absence of a binding contract); and besides the actual riddim itself, I like to see if the producer has gone the extra mile to give any variations on the riddim, making the album FAR more fan friendly and easy to listen to, for those who may not have the patience to sit through sometimes 20 tracks (this time `only` 16) worth of tunes on the exact same riddim. Besides the variations, the Nookie has everything I look for. It does take a few minor shifts during its 16 tracks (most notably during Elephant Man's track Buss Up Yuh Steel), but for the most part, the riddim is a somewhat unusual docile hardcore riddim (it almost reminds a little of Scatta's Double Jeopardy riddim from 2001) which proves a little difficult to ride, probably due to the oddly placed (but wonderfully done) guitar right in the middle of the track.Jam2 and his brother John John, who built the Nookie together also did a great job of artist selection. Due to their family's extensive experience in the field, they pretty much had their choice of anyone they wanted to work with but they took their time and even added some of the younger talents who really shine on the Nookie and thus, make the riddim itself shine. Never neglecting the true dancehall and reggae heavyweights, you'll find the type of names which will ultimately sell an album of this variety as the Bountys, Beenies, Sizzlas, and Bujus of the world are on track as well (as well as I couple I didn't mention) and they all (with one possible exception) do a well enough job.Starting the album is actually two of the weaker tracks on the riddim. Both Sizzla and especially Buju fail to deliver their bests with their Oh Yes and Look Out Fi Dem, respectively. Sizzla's Oh Yes isn't bad at all however, he actually pushes one of the best hooks on the riddim completely and several times I remember the tune playing in Jamaican dancehalls, but you go through and you get lyric after lyric for fodder of the Kalonji critics who claim the Bobo has gone too slack. Buju just doesn't seem to have the Nookie set well in his sites. It took me several times actually listening to Look Out fi Dem to FIND the chorus (and maybe that says more about me than Buju) in the track, and it actually comes off as a complete freestyle and definitely not Gargamel's best freestyle at that. The only other truly questionable track on the Nookie riddim is probably the stereotypically named and discussed All About the G's, by the poorly named Money God, and all I can say about that is that I'm definitely not looking forward to anything in the future from this young artist (although he does drop a few clever lines and has a decent flow, a longer gestation period is needed before tackling such a `big' riddim).That leaves the other 13 tracks to shine and most of them more than carry their weight on the track. Check what is probably the riddim's best tune, We Set Di Trend by the Doctor. Despite ridiculously not being included on Beenie's last album, Undisputed, one could make the point that late 2005-early `06 saw no bigger track from the dancehall king, dropping in finely on the history of the dancehall, just a powerful track despite being completely in control of the big riddim at the same time, and clearly aimed at the dancehall session. Beenie's counterpart, Bounty Killa also shines on the Nookie delivering his harsh harsh Under di Blood. Under di Blood is pure and simple exactly what I imagine John John and Jam2 had in mind when they finished the Nookie. it's a high powered and very hardcore track by that specific genre's ace over the past decade, and Bounty doesn't disappoint at all, as he completely KILLS the Nookie with Under di Blood."Murder dem mi son Adi, dem no ready fi yuh daddy!", Bounty utters on Under di Blood and when `mi son' gets his chance over the Nookie he delivers the seriously slack and equally wicked Proper Thing (aka Ain't I, also aka Proper English). Kartel shows you can take a well worn and tired topic of discussion and CONSTANTLY bring it back and back and no one will complain should you have the vibes and lyrics to do so, Proper Thing is more than top flight material for the Nookie!Check surprisingly Wayne Marshall's vocodered Put Your Lighter High. Never been too big of a Marshall fan, but he does his thing on the Nookie so you have to respect the track. Also checking in is Elephant Man on the ridiculous Buss Yuh Steel, which finds Ele turning back the clock circa 2000 with tracks like One More Start a War (with Ward 21) and the sick sick Replacement Killers, Buss Yuh Steel is of that quality. Repping for the ladies is dancehall Empress and Princess, Lady Saw shines on her man's riddim with her No Drop di Ting as does Ce'cile with her Nah Badda, explaining exactly what her man can't be lacking in the bedroom.But this riddim is all about the leaders of the next generation, the big timers as well as the not so big timers. Check Bugle's surprisingly strong Caan Trick We. And lastly the big three of the next generation: Mavado teaming up with Ward 21 (who sound just as home on the Nookie as anyone,, considering it sounds exactly like something straight out of their studios) on the exceptional Baby Shatta, sounding like something which could have fit perfectly on one of their earlier albums. And I'm torn between which tune I enjoy more, Busy Signal's !SICK! Think Dem Bad on which you almost wonder where he's taking his breaths with the flow being so exceptional; and on the other hand is lyrics machine Aidonia's HEAVY One Motion! In typical 'Donia style he almost outruns the riddim but stays on cadence perfectly demonstrating a style only the masters could appreciate honestly.Overall, definitely recommending the Nookie to the riddim collectors out there. Always love new riddims from the less than active (they do their part, but with their volume we could certainly see much more) Jammy's camp these days. And the Nookie is amongst the best that we've heard coming down the road in the past few years, place it amongst the Sidewalk University (one of the widely regarded best of 2006) but not receiving that type of push. For the non-collectors out there, if you're a fan of modern hardcore dancehall, trust that it doesn't get much better than the Nookie.

Going through the annals of my collection of Sizzla Kalonji records (about 20 now) I came across Freedom Cry and its UK/Jamaican counterpart &quot;Kalonji&quot; and I realized that I hadn't really ever sat down and listened to it, even though I pretty much already knew just about every tune by heart except for the title track. Anyway, I put it on, and it put out such an incredible vibe that everybody in my house was just sitting around knocking their heads and just feeling the beautiful lyrics on this one. Everybody already knows about Black Woman &amp; Child, and Praise Ye Jah, which both were released the year before this one, and this one went pretty much overlooked. (I bought it, and overlooked it for about 3 years) But its an album like this one and Burning Up, and Good Ways, and Royal Son of Ethiopia that helps build Sizzla's legend outside of his 2 legendary, classic records. This one is absolutely cleansed of all bad tunes and just truly a wonderful record. My favorite tunes include, Freedom Cry, the wonderful Saturated, the hit Rain Showers, which was so good that it was released as a download single in the US and did pretty well, Till It Some More, Real, and my absolute favorite Ancient Memories, which he does so well in concert. Overall, I say, if you like Sizzla and you don't have this one, then certainly pick this one up, if you haven't already. And if you have it, then put it on, its truly a wonderful project.

Like many of his peers, the great Luciano is seemingly impervious or unaware of the concept of over saturation or over exposure. He has and has had no problem with releasing upwards of 5-6 albums a year for various producers, in any part of the reward. The bottomline seemingly being for him: If you have vibes, Luciano will will work with you. MAYBE EVEN IF YOU DONT!Last year he dropped a rather nice album in Guyana for producer Walter Fraser's which went virtually unnoticed but was still a big album. This somewhat prepatory album, Now and Forever was done for Howard Williams' Mighty Man out of New York and is another fine fine album for the overflowing shelves of Luciano material out there.You can't really complain too much when the Messenger drops an album. Now & Forever is the typical top class material you are used to hearing from the artist, and probably one of the best overall releases of the year. Luciano won't capture the imagination of too many fans, he's not as flashy as some of his contemporaries such as Sizzla or Capleton, definitely not as controversial, but he is always refreshing to hear and his overall consistency and reggae's undisputed best roots singer for nearing a decade is definitely more than just respectable.The best tune here is without a doubt Kings of Kings, a reverential song about Rastafari. The song is not unlike dozens of other from Luciano, but just not unlike dozens of songs by Luciano, it makes a well powerful point without being anywhere near over the top. Also definitely check the following 2 tracks, 2 of the finest of Now and Forever. Both I've Got to Rise and the downright awesome Rooted and Grounded score top for this album.Also check the bouncy If Jah is For Us, very nice tune; The nyha drum on Almight Knows, probably the would-be biggest hit on the album if it received its deserved radio spin. And of course the closing track, with the excellent excellent Dean Fraser sax, Love Can Save the World. The album gets an expected jump up with the jazz remix of 'Love' which is ever so slight because the original tune has somewhat of a jazz feel to it (actually a lot of the album does). The title track is a lover's tune and very very nicely done, nice one drop; And I'd be doing you a disservice if I didnt mention the nice nice vibe on Old Tecka.Overall, definitely have to biggup Luciano as usual for the album. Later this month, he is prepared to release Child of a King which is reportedly going to be one of the biggest of his career. Typically Jet Star would fine a way to interrupt the attention for that coming big album, by releasing an album recorded 5 years ago or something (and we still have 3 weeks to go, so they still might!) but definitely give Now & Forever a listen while waiting for Child of a King. It most reminds me of the Lessons of Life album from 2004 from Fat Eyes, and its definitely a big big vibe, more than just an appetizer.(and upon further review, Jet Star did 'sneak' out Shallow Water in July).

This album is just the absolute definition of mediocrity in the dancehall compilation genre, I mean, there are extremely terrible parts of the record, (I.e. Twingy Twang by Hawkeye, both cuts by Bling Dog and Hold Her Space by Silver Cat), but on the other hand there absolutely brilliant cuts, with the best being Player by Spragga Benz, who has just been tearing it up recently. And the rhythm on Player is brilliant, and its used on the following cut Water From My Eyes by Bounty Killer, which is very good. BK's other song Follow Mi Arrow, is also very good. A lot of these songs are available on other compilations and even by the same record company, which doesn't speak well for Jamdown that they keep using the same songs. The annoying club host (Presumably Jazzy T) brings the album down alot, I would've given it a 4 if he were not on it. 2 songs by Red Rat, one with Goofy, and Beenie Man creeping back towards top form with Done Have Mi Things, and of course Sway by Vegas, help save this record from being absolute garbage.

I received Elijah Prophet's King of Kings quite unexpectedly. Despite being an established singer in Jamaica for over a decade and a proven singer, songwriter and performer, King of Kings would be Prophet's debut album. Its almost a shame that a notoriously wicked wicked artist and vibesman would have to wait for such a long period, and also seek out a label based in Germany, especially considring the current roots-swing that is goig on in Jamaica at this point, but Prophet has taken full advantage of that period of 'gestation' (a BIG LONG gestation) as in King of Kings he has dropped what is probably the single most impressive reggae debut of 2006.German label Pow Pow which came from Pow Pow Sound, has made quite a name for themselves in recent years. Besides creating some of the nicest roots riddims out of Europe (i.e. the Blaze and the MASSIVE Superior), where the competition has been growing and growing with nice roots labels emerging by the year; they have also voiced some of the finest roots and dancehall talents JA has to offer. The result is a very respected name in reggae and their decision to make their long awaited artist studio album debut, the long awaited studio album debut of Elijah Prophet is nothing short of brilliant.Elijah Prophet's style is one I always described as being a little more uptempo, more matured and less gifted version of Jah Cure (all singers anywhere can only HOPE to be called 'less gifted' than the martian voiced Cure). And the first time I actually heard him, I was surprised that he had not been a bigger name that he had been, but instead, after serving an apprenticeship for the late legendary Garnett Silk, he had paid an equal ammount of attention to his songwriting and penned tunes for some of the bigger name in reggae. After returning strictly to writing for himself, he went the route of so many of our under-appreciated roots singers and began touring the European scene almost exclusively (thus the German link).The German link has produced this fine fine roots album, King of Kings! Of course in honor of His Imperial Majesty, the album finds Pow Pow laying the foundation for some of the best roots tracks I've heard in all of 2006. It also makes it quite difficult to choose a favourite tune! For the moment at least, I'm going with the BEAUTIFUL One & All. The Sav La Mar native creates a marvelous vibes on the tune and is more aggressive than on the majority of the balance of the album.Definitely give massive spins to the rest of the album as well. Check the title track, over Pow Pow's biggest score to date, the heavy Superior riddim. So named after Gentleman's hit of the same name, the wonderful one drop created by the drum and horn driven riddim combined with Prophet's top notch lyrics make it easy to see why the tune was chosen as the title track without a doubt. Also really really big here is the opener Piece of Ganja, a well powerful herbalist track, which somewhat reminds me of Perfect's Locked Me Up, perhaps even outdoing the St Ann's chanter (BIG UP ST ANN'S!).Also need to check out Back For Good over Pow Pow's Blaze riddim (the 'bed' which Richie Spice's huge Blood Again sleeps in). Always love to see different takes on the top riddims and Prophet chose to create a pretty fierce love tune over the riddim and scores one of the highest points on the Blaze. Check the almost criminally beautiful Mother Nature which sports probably the finest hook on King of Kings. Also LOVVVVVVVVVVE Nah Tek no Talk, a big and vibrant sounding one drop which I imagine Prophet mashes up in live performance. Check the sole combination here, Sensi fi Bun with fine dub poet DYCR over the 1st Sight riddim, always love to see DYCR combinations with artists, the contrasting styles is always very interesting with his super on point aggressiveness and the laid back riddim with cool Elijah Prophet's vocals make the tune a definite must hear.But don't let those recommendations keep you from the rest of the album, I gave it 5 stars, all the tunes here are worth several listenings (and I gotta recommend the bouncy and almost ska-like Music is Life).Overall, of course I'm recommending Elijah Prophet's King of Kings as one of the bigger roots pieces of the year. I definitely would hate to see a similarly talented artist come around and have to wait so long for a debut (although it almost pretty REGULARLY occurs with roots singers), but in this case, it seems Prophet waited for just the right moment. He joins such fine singers as Mark Wonder and Prince Theo as artists in the prime of their careers who have to leave Jamaica for Europe (and several more as well) to gain a proper respect for the serious vibes they produce. I want EM ALL to COME HOME! Making this level is worthy of respect, anywhere! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to change my best reggae albums of 2006 list. . .AMAZING, GO GET IT!

(4.5stars)If you go through the bargain bin of any Caribbean record store or the bottom of the crates and boxes of any avid reggae collector, you're almost certain to find something which you didn't even know existed. I myself have run into similar situations (ESPECIALLY since moving back home, I seemingly missed out on nearly a decade of Caribbean only releases) in local stores, finding pieces which I had NO IDEA were ever released on labels which I had heard of, but just never seemed to pop up on my radar. Although I have to admit that this has become a more and more rare occurrence in the past couple of years, as reggae albums (specifically albums) have ran and gone east it has happened to a greater degree. There have been SO MANY big name to mid-level big names in reggae and dancehall music over the past three years who have released albums exclusive to Japan (which is apparently reggae-STARVING as it seems almost weekly that artists, even without albums, are heading to the far east for tours and other promotional ventures as well). Now, while I'm not at all going anywhere near out of my way to track down albums from the likes of Chino, Sadiki, Terry Linen, Kiprich or Voicemail (like three times now) (yet I got each and everyone of their albums); when I start looking at release charts and seeing them filled with the likes of Spragga Benz, Ward 21 (even though their own album was rubbish, they have also kept a steady stream of riddim releases as well), Kris Kelli, Da'ville, Hero, Mr. Vegas, Alaine, Ce'cile most recently even Busy Signal and Aidonia and a whole heap of others (including Burro Banton) have also taken the Asian route and I CANNOT possibly be expected just to let it go! These releases will almost NEVER make their way to the west in full, for one reason or another and fans in the west will have access to them through HUGE imports rates for just one album (and all the reggae heads STILL paid the costs anyway, myself included). Now out of everyone of those albums what was lacking was a bonafide reggae superstar taking that route to release an album which would almost HAVE TO make its way across the waters and onto store shelves. The Buju Banton's, the Sean Paul's, the Shaggy's, the Bounty Killer's, the Elephant Man's, and even the Sizzla's of the world never took the route (because seemingly none had a problem finding a western distributor to distribute an album for them). That changed with Concept of Life, when, arguably the most familiar name of them all, not only went Japanese but did so with one of his finest albums EVER.Enter Beenie Man. Without a doubt even over Sean Paul, Shaggy and Buju Banton, the name Beenie Man has been the one most commonly associated with hardcore dancehall and reggae internationally (locally it would be Buju, Beenie and Bounty) over the past decade plus. He has kept himself relevant by scoring mid to BIG level hits internationally, releasing relatively successful albums on a major label in Virgin (relatively speaking in terms of regular major albums, reggae speaking, he has done phenomenal) and by keeping himself surrounded in just enough hype and just enough controversy to keep his name one of the very few living worldwide household names from reggae music. Locally speaking, Jamaica has NEVER seen a more consistent hit-maker on local scales. It may be another decade even before Beenie Man fails to score at least a single number one song. Thus, perhaps, most importantly in a genre which features a virtual revolving door of talent in and out almost annually: Beenie Man, the self proclaimed current King of the Dancehall, has succeeded in maintaining his throne for such a long period of time, where his two predecessors (King Yellowman and Shabba Ranking), did not. Also its worth mentioning that really and truly Beenie Man may be THE MOST gifted and talented all around artist the dancehall has EVER seen. Therefore, it was no great surprise for me to see that FINALLY an album which I had been telling people a great deal about from the time I received it in its original Japanese release form (which I THINK would have been mid-late 2006). If you have strictly been a Beenie Man fan based on his album releases then (internationally speaking) you might have to go all the way back to late 1997 to find a release which matches Concept of Life in quality (that release would have been the Grammy winning MAMMOTH Many Moods of Moses, more on that in a bit, also check 2000`s BIG Trendsetter album). Concept of Life is highlighted by the return of the once much hailed `Ras Moses' persona of Beenie Man; which was the artist in him who, when given the chance and proper opportunity, could deliver top notch rootical tracks mirroring the dancehall boomshots of `Beenie Man' himself. Produced almost completely by the perhaps equally just as much once hailed Kingston based Free Willy Music headed by Neil Amos (and his brother Arthur), Concept of Life was THE album most hardcore reggae heads had been looking for in the place of albums like Art & Life (although that one, I liked), Tropical Storm, Back to Basics and Undisputed. All of those albums (in my opinion and with the exception of Tropical Storm, by far the worst of the bunch) were decent, yet somewhat uneven in retrospect, but were all geared toward the international market and latent with crossover attempts and combinations. Free Willy had none of the such shenanigans with Concept of Life and not only built the album with tunes which had been proven on the Jamaican scene, but with tunes which were FAR more familiar in terms of vibes with the typical hardcore reggae heads. Gone were the Janet Jacksons and T.I.'s, they had been replaced with Lady Spice and Don Mafia instead. Concept of Life was also a step up for Free Willy itself as they had also helmed the controls for the very strange 2006 VP Records release from Sizzla Kalonji, Ain't Gonna See Us Fall as Concept of Life finally gave someone a reason to kick in a little extra funds for the import.If you were patient, however, and did not run out and order it up, you now have your reward as the album, which did just as much damage as it reached France (where it literally became an underground hit) as it had in Japan, you probably saved about half your money (you also missed four tracks which are gone on the western version). Concept of Life is ran through by the familiar French based Corner Shop Records (which I believe has distribution in the states through the well known Koch). Concept of Life is a VERY healthy mix of dancehall and roots material, much like Many Moods of Moses and just like that well renown album is certain to be a highlight of Beenie's catalogue at the end of his career. The album opens with the very familiar and very Beenie Man typical clever Do Supmmm which flows over the lovely He Speaks riddim (same riddim from Sizzla's Ain't Gonna See Us Fall). Were you to just listen to the riddim alone, a big and lushly beautiful guitar driven composition with nice horns, you might not expect Do Supmmm to be what it turns out to be. The song isn't a slow inspirational or spiritual vibes (which is what Sizzla did with it), instead, it's a rather entertaining `recounting' of Beenie's mythical bedroom conquests of the likes of Mariah Carey, Serena Williams, Brittany Spears and a whole heap of others. The tune grew on me, I used to hate it, but I now see its power, its hilarious and really NO OTHER dancehall/reggae artist could have made the tune work the way Beenie does (and a man can dream, cant he?). Up next is the title track and really one of the signature tunes of the album and its first combination alongside the very first King of the Dancehall, Daddy U-Roy over Free Willy's relicking of an old studio one riddim, the I Hold the Handle. The tune is really a BIG tune, besides the historical significance of the combination, the tune is just BIG with the message being man and woman together and simply how that love can make the world a better place (the real concept of life). As expected the two legends both play their parts to class and near perfection, the result is easily one of Concept of Life's biggest efforts (not the biggest though!). Closing the opening of the album is the least impressive of the three, but the still decent Love You, over another old Studio One redo, the Love Me Forever. The tune carries a nice enough vibes but features in its chorus a rather odd and ANNOYING over singing/whining Beenie incidentally, its the second time he recorded on the riddim, a young Beenie Man had his chance voicing on the original Love Me Forever riddim on the very nice tune Show Fi Flop).The real highlights here come in the combinations in my opinion as they are some of the more interesting and powerful tunes on the piece altogether. Try the first two after the title track Settle Down and Hot alongside Gringo (Don Mafia) and Lady Spice, respectively. Good luck getting sequels to either tack as Beenie has since had very public fallouts with both artists but here, they make it work to a degree with Settle Down definitely being the stronger of the two. Gringo was a former songwriter (and business partner and friend) of Beenie and the two have (obviously) always worked well together. Hear they combine with the pounding dancehall style which suits them both fine (although the riddim is kind of odd) over the tropical/easy yet addictive Happy Living riddim. The X-rated Hot is another weird vibes, the riddim here sounds like `circus dancehall', but really and truly Spice is one very talented artist on her own merits and she combines with the Doctor to a nice vibes. It probably will NEVER happen, but I'd love to see the two relink on a far more conventional dancehall tune someday, it could be a master class. Those two combinations are topped by two later combinations which produce the highest level of mastery on the album altogether. Check the WICKED Imagination alongside longtime Beenie Man spar and label mate at Shocking Vibes, singer Devonte. Imagination was longtime one of my favourite tunes from the Ras Moses side of Beenie Man and a real winner. The tune speaks directly on a social nature and does so to such a strong degree that you'll literally wonder why you hadn't heard it sooner and it shows just what a real all around master in reggae can do given the proper chance, in this case a wicked Amos relick of an old Bunny Lee riddim, the Every Body Needs Love. It is ONLY topped by the MAMMOTH shot that was One Pound a Day alongside classic reggae singers John Holt and Cornell Campbell. That tune was probably my absolute favourite tune for about a year! The tune is (of course) an herbalist anthem and one so LARGE that it would definitely rank in the top five that I've heard on that vibes (and I've probably heard literally thousands at this point). The elders also more than hold their own and I would love to hear a new combination with just the two of them taking it. Flowing DIVINELY over the popular Father Jungle Rock riddim, One Pound a Day has been keeping dancehalls packed and smoky for almost three years now. BIG BIG TUNE! The balance of Concept of Life is full of solid material which, although it never reaches the heights, is still more than well solid. The best of the rest is probably the wicked Politrix, a tune which is very much on the same vibes as Imagination but it is Beenie flying solo. The tune is very solid and really is the type of tune which, had you thrown it on any of the recent releases from Beenie would have been the type which received little attention but would've been amongst the biggest tunes on either of them. Very nice tune. Both No Promise and Nah Resign carry in solid more usual style hard dancehall vibes for the dancehall heads with the better being Nah Resign over Free Willy's ultra-creative and bouncy Prado riddim on which Beenie Man, both literally and with the wicked level of his flow reminds all just how easy this whole dancehall thing has been for him and who is the REAL big man in the business. The album closes going back to the reality vibes with God Black and the BIG From Birth. God Black is cool and sweet old vibes and is quietly BRILLIANTLY, definitely have to check that one where From Birth is the bigger sounding feel good vibes closing the album wonderfully alongside singer Zahair. The tune reminds all to be thankful for what we have and really focus on the goodness and strength of His Majesty. Very good way to end an album.Overall, if you happen to be a bigtime reggae head who was just quite sour and disappointed with Beenie Man's most recent out puts (in terms of albums) then Concept of Life was made JUST FOR YOU. There aren't any crossover attempts and Janet Jackson is NOWHERE to be found. This would actually be Beenie's first full dancehall/reggae release since the WICKED and hard to find Trendsetter album for Shocking Vibes and its probably even an all-around better strike than that album (which is 100% for the dancehall heads(except for the AWFUL Believe in Me tune). So much on point reggae-wise is Concept of Life that I can't even recommend this one to newer fans (you should check either Back to Basics, Art & Life or Undisputed for a wholly more digestible vibes for newcomers). Concept of Life is hopefully the first in a long string of solid releases making their ways over from Japan and it is WITHOUT A DOUBT, one of the biggest albums of Beenie Man's long and storied career.

I just wonder if we can still consider a compilation, to be a REAL compilation when nearly a quarter of its massive 40 track selection is filled by only one artist? I mean, maybe such a project dips into more of a 'showcase' album or a 'glossy promo' album. What's happening on the track selection for the latest installment of the riddim album is just downright strange.Of the 40 tracks in this annual project, 9 of them feature Greensleeves' exclusive artist Vybz Kartel. Vybz Kartel is a fantastic artist, dont get me wrong, he has an unusual talent the likes of which the dancehall hasn't seen in one artist alone for awhile and his lyrics stay on an almost sick level of precision (when he's not recycling them). But, as of last year, this album saw 12! of his tracks, which is WAY too many as is, 9 is still too many and you get the feel that GS is strictly about hyping the new JMT album with this one.Besides that, the album isn't too impressive, it's never TOO impressive, but its not as good this year as it usually is. Highlights from the first disc include Realest Thing by. . . you know who, a seriously fun ride through typical Kartel country. Wacky Dip, yet another pretty good tribute to fallen dancehall King, Bogle, by Voisemail and Ding-Dong. A could have been better combination between the doctor and Admiral Bailey, and perhaps the single best tune on the disc, Man Neva Leave You, also by Beenie Man (who probably had the best showing on last year's album as well).Disc 2 of course features the hit Frame I&I; by Beenie Man, probably the best tune on either of the 2 discs. Disc 2 is almost completely worthless however. Subpar efforts by Buju, Kalonji and Capleton on Siren, Pretty Girls and Tek Weh U A-K respectively, highlight the album. The best material, however, is reserved for a rejuvenated Mad Cobra (from whom we need a new album seriously) on Last Year's Clothes which was much better than I expected, a ultra-targeted Kartel on No Apology (guess we'll be hearing from RAGE again pretty soon), on which he goes as far as to declare the very first word he taught to his newborn son in his crib (you have to listen to figure out what that is exactly!)and a completely out of place Anthony B on World of Reggae Music, a straight roots one-drop tune from the Bobo.Its perhaps most interesting to see the track break down here. Greensleeves Records has 5 artists signed exclusively. Kartel being their biggest score, as I mentioned, has 9 of these 40 tunes. Macka Diamond, their second biggest dancehall artist has 4 (the best of which is Stepmother). And Kid Kurrupt has 1, the very very very very average Title. Fantan Mojah isn't featured at all, as expected, his style is neither ragga nor dancehall and kudos to GS for not putting him on here just. . . because. But forgotten man Predator is not featured on one track AT ALL. And I'm not complaining AT ALL!Overall, just generally by what this is you probably know what to expect. Never take any one of the reviews for a 40 track album which features various artists too seriously, there's a very good chance that you could buy this one and find it thoroughly enjoyable, its just Sooooooo much material here. It is what it is, and just this year, it aint too pretty.

Its been a rather odd 2 and a half years since the release of Adidja Palmer's (aka Vybz Kartel) debut album, Up 2 di Time. Since then he's made his share of headlines both in and out of the studio and on and off stage. He's also survived a fe moments (one in particular) where it seemed that Kartel may never get to fulfill any of the potential that he had originally showed and then he just had some weird stuff going on.Weird is the word of the day as Vybz Kartel releases the literal followup to Up 2 Di Time (he had both an updated version of his debut, More Up 2 Di Time, and an underground album, Timeless released in '04)with the massively awaited J.M.T. (Jamaican Mean Time). The first thing you'll undoubtedly notice is the strange thing going on with the cover. I don't know what to make of it, it looks like some futuristic. . . I don't know what it looks like, and I imagine just a few fans seeing it on the shelf (although odd, it is presented very very well) might pick it up on site alone. And no offense to the man, but he is one strange looking cat!The music? That's another weird one. The music is. . . kind of the same sounding but should you be able to understand Kartel's lightspeed martian flows you'll find that he has matured a little. Before, it was literally all guns and all girls, nothing else, the first album only had one tune which didn't fit that mode (kinda, the humorous Robbery, which of course involved guns). JMT is loaded with tunes that could actually be construed as dancehall/roots tunes. What's missing is the nice Can't Move We from the massive Seasons riddim. Tunes like Dutty Landlord, Smuggler (kind of), and the hit Emergency all show Kartel as being able to hold a mic on something different (would have loved a new one-drop tune though).More traditional fans never worry, this is still a Vybz Kartel album. Tight P*&^%Y Gal Dem, Realest Thing, Guns Like These, Late Night with Wayne Marshall and especially Gun Session, which is an impressive old school sounding gun tune all ring of the same old Kartel, but do they?The mood here completely is just different. Vybsy Versa Love (huh?) features Barrington Levy on a riddim sounding right of a Kanye West studio, the tune, however, is ultimately addictive. Very very good work and maybe the best tune here. What I am deeming the best tune, however is Bad Man Party 2 which finds Kartel doing what sets him apart from most in the dance. The rapid fire flows that keep you shaking, instead of nodding, your head and keeping pulling the song up going "what!".Also check Car Man (which rides the. . . Beverly Hills Cop riddim?), Need U Girl with Wayne Marshall (2 albums 4 Marshall combinations) the awesome Realest Thing, the ultra creative So Me a Say, and lastly the HILARIOUS Rough Sex with female singer Delicious (whose making quite a name for herself in the dancehall).Working the boards here are typical producers, Vendetta, Birch, Leftside & Esco, Scatta and a host a newer and lesser known producers.Overall, although I don't give it as high a review as his debut (I was looking forward to that one for a loooooooooong time), JMT is distinctly better than U2T. The album sounds totally different, more laid back and a higher concentration on quality control. Its a very unusual release for the artist, however, in a few years, should he continue to rise, we may look back at JMT as the turn in the right direction for Vybz Kartel.

In a rather odd occurence, in 2005 roots reggae upstart Fantan Mojah, easily one of the most sought after conscious dj's in Jamaica, has signed a deal with UK reggae giant label Greensleeves to release his debut album, Hail the King, named after his most successful single to date. We didnt have to wait very long for the album to come out, as Mojah had just really bust on the scene in 2004 and had been flooding the market with strong material with a few very large hits mixed in.Even more unusual is the fact that the usually timid to release an artist's album (not named Sizzla) Greensleeves released his record exactly when they said they would. And somewhere in JA Kurrup and Predator (GS's seemingly forgotten dancehall signees) continue to be overlooked (and last time it was by Anthony B who doesn't even work for GS). Nevertheless the world of music is a better place with a Fantan Mojah album on the racks.The most non-surprising facet of this deal is that, expectedly, Mojah's debut album is a rich, inspiring and healthy tour de force of roots music. The young chanter proves that his somewhat unusual style can indeed support an entire album with no real weak spots throughout its 18 tracks. Hail the King is a wonderful debut for a soon-to-be King of roots.The best tune here (again, no so surprisingly) is the MASSIVE title track on the maroon riddim which might make Count Ossie himself proud of the beautiful Nya drumming on the track which goes completely in one direction of showing the still developing Mojah's talents as it comes off as more of a chant than a dj's tune. Also standing out on Hail the King is the high profile combination with the incarcerated, but still ultra busy ridiculous voiced Jah Cure, Nah Build Great Man. Everything Cure has been touching these days has been turning into gold (literally) and Nah Build Great Man is no exception, the tune works completely.Fantan Mojah becomes the second artist (after Sean Paul) to be lucky enough to have his album blessed with terrifyingly beautiful Seasons riddim from superproducer Vendetta, and he handles it just about as good as anyone (not named Jah Cure). He also makes use of a timeless Bobby Digital riddim, best known as the backdrop to Sizzla's brilliant Words of Divine on King of Kings, which I initially thought to be just wrong but the youth makes it work completely in proving himself worthy.Of course you have to check Mojah's second biggest tune, Hungry, over the Invasion riddim, very fine tune; Feel the Pain, a rather clever testament to the strength of the Black Woman; Corruption (which I'm certain Mojah's base label and album producers, Downsound, are touting as his next big tune, because they also remixed it); speaking of remixes, Hail the King's remix is even more luscious and vibrant and nearly as good as the original; and 2 of the other combinations here, Uplift Yourself with First Born and especially Rastafari is the Ruler are both relatively big tunes. And I can't forget about Search, probably my 3rd favorite tune here overall (after the title track and Nuh Build Great Man).Overall, Fantan Mojah's style may take a little while to get used to, even for the most experienced of modern roots fan, he kind of shifts in between pure djaying, pure chanting, and pure singing as several of his contemporaries (i.e. Sizzla, Turbulence etc.) but where you're completely used to hearing such from them, Mojah's heavy raspy voice is another 'weapon' which he makes work doing whatever he chooses. Get past that and Hail the King is a wonderfully vibrant debut from an artist, whose time appears to be in the future, but listening to him right now certainly is fun. Biggup to the artist and GS for another wonderfully packaged product, which is very important for promoting the music to the non-reggae fan.On a side note, you have to love 2005 if you're a fan of modern roots reggae music. Multiple releases (as usual) from Sizzla, Turbulence, Luciano and Anthony B, albums from established artists such as Junior Kelly, Everton Blender, Freddie McGregor, Warrior King and Damian Marley, debuts from Mojah, Natty King, I Wayne and conscious tinged dancehall artist Assassin AND a Queen Omega album! Wonderful year for the music.

Reggae giant VPRecords made a rather large statement earlier this year in signing up Richie Spice. Over the last 3-4 years Spice has proven himself one of the bigger hitmakers in all of reggae music and has definitely carved out a rather large fanbase for himself. In doing so, instead of, as traditionally, allowing him to go and make his album, they have chosen to release his sophomore album, released originally in 2004 for 5th Element Records.This is an odd release for VP. They have done this in the past for records such as Sizzla's Good Ways and Black Woman & Child and more recently a few of their own albums (such as the Lalabella riddim album) but this one seems to be for new reason than to promote the forthcoming Spice release for VP. Yes, the original was not on wide release (why Jetstar or SOMEONE never picked up the distribution for both it and Chuck Fender's album Better Days is a mystery to me), and I know people who could not find it for awhile. But it's place was a rather comfortable one, it still had a fine run and to be re-released after just TWO years seems at least somewhat unusual.Musically, you can't question the intentions. Spice in Your Life is a fine fine album, but as I said, the album is just 2 years old, so the big tunes here are still rather fresh on the tip of your tongue.Best tune here is without a doubt Earth a Run Red, the tune which has run Spice's career red to date. Excellent big big tune. Also check Black a Tar, 911, Folly Living, the massive Marijuana from the 5th Element riddim and the combination with Chuck Fenda, Fake Smile. 2 songs are added here which were not on the 5E release, the unremarkable accoustic Spinning Around and Ghetto Girl which just happens to be on the Hardtimes riddim, one of the biggest from '04, so chances are good you probably know that one as well. (definitely looking forward to Just the Other Day to be included on the new album)Overall, get this one, ONLY if you missed out on the first round of releases. (And if you are a reggae fan then shame on you for missing it). The songs here will sound a little played, their older, but not old enough to where you'll just revel in hearing them again, most of these songs will still make the cut on a Spice stage show. This probably would have been better released as a double with the new release, however, no fault to the artist, big big songs here, wonderful message and just all around good music. Looking forward to this fall for the new album.

The reggae world keeps a constant eye on Richie Spice. The 'young vet' has proved to be a consistent hit maker in roots and nearly everything he touches turns to gold. Backed by a bloodline perhaps only third to anyone named Marley or Morgan in reggae the new age Rasta singer with the unusual voice has carved out a specific niche in reggae which demands constant attention.Spice in Your Life is his second album, and its terribly difficult to find (as you can see this one is an import all the way from Japan) if you live outside of Europe or the Caribbean. But should you find a way to get it (and even I wouldn't pay this much for it) its definitely worth the efforts.A few of the tunes here have become flat out anthems in Jamaica and several still smaller hits. For starters, try Black Like Tar over the massive Stress riddim, Crying Out for Love (which is the only singer to date besides the original who I would recommend over the riddim) over the same riddim which backed Sizzla's timeless Thank U Mamma. And those are the smaller tunes here.The heavy ammo whips out around track 7, Righteous Youths, the song is just about brilliantly simple, works nicely and starts a stretch of about 5 lethal tunes. The big tune, 911, followed by the even bigger Folly Living. Later in teh album you get a big combination with 2 of Spice's brothers singer Spanner Banner and DJ Snatcher Dogg, the song works. Also check the even bigger combination, the wonderful Fake Smile with ex-labelmate Chuck Fenda.All that being said the 2 big tunes here are Marijuana over the I Swear riddim and the album's biggest and best tune Earth a Run Red. The tune seemingly died and was resurrected (it also appeared on his first album in 2000) and just took Jamaica by storm in '04 as if reggae had forgotten just how HUGE it was.Overall, definitely check Spice in Your Life. It is of course something different, you dont find vocals like this anywhere else in reggae for the most part (although I'm starting to maintain that young Gyptian sounds a little like Spice, and he does acknowledge Spice as an influence)(guess I'll hopefully be writing a review to his debut sometime this year as well). And this album is for some of the not so deep fans of the music, if you've picked up a roots mixtape over the last 2 years, you've heard some of these tunes without a doubt and you should definitely put the entire album in your rotation.

If all is fair in love and war, then I supposed Lady Mackerel is the yin to Vybz Kartel's yang. Walk through the miles and miles of tunes Kartel (and his peers as well) has done which are of a negative variety to whomever in particular, and eventually you'll run into Lady Mackerel, now called Macka Diamond. In the past 4 years Diamond has seen the type of career resurrection normally only reserved for a member of the Marley family or Ninjaman. She also came back to the type of fanbase which was starving for a new voice to be heard and say what you will (AND I WILL) but Macka Diamond had been one of the most celebrated feminine voices in all of reggae over the past few years.Over the years the female presence in dancehall has always been small, powerful, but still small. We've had the Queen of Dancehall Lady Saw, being the most consistent face at the top of the pile as well as talented 'supporting acts' such as the supremely wicked Ce'cile and one of the best lyricists in the game, Tanya Stephens. There have been, still, countless faces coming, going and several I-Don't-Know-What-Happened-to-Hers: Such as teh on-again, off-again Queen Paula, Lady Patra and even Lady Mackerel. Even moreso, the young ranks of up and coming talents are amongst the strongest group reggae has ever seen as artists like Lady Spice and the Angelic Alaine figure to be big stars in just a couple of years.And through all of that even Macka has managed to make her name amongst the first mentioned, male or female, in dancehall. Her topics are generally the exact opposite of a lot of the guys: Where they rhyme about using a female for sex, she'll rhyme about using a man for sex and his money (can't you tell by the conspicuously done title?). Macka is about female empowerment to the max!It just sounds so much better when Saw, Ce'cile and Tanya do it.Money-O is the combination of over a decade and a half in the business for Macka Diamond. The Kingston native signed a deal with Greensleeves (and like everyone who does so is now complaining about their lack of promotion) almost immediately after hitting the pinnacle of her career and climbing nearly every reggae chart in the world with her brand of feminine powered dancehall (there are 5-6 tracks here which were HITS).But she's not as classic as Saw, not as polished as Ce'cile, nowhere near as gifted as Tanya nor even as explosive as Spice.Macka's strength is in responding. The entire Money-O album seems to be a big slap in the face to the years and years of horrible mistreatment by many of the male artists in the dancehall. Which is certainly more than warranted at this point. And although I may be very critical, the album is not without its moments as with 10+ years in the game, Macka has definitely acquired some skills and nowhere is that evident moreso than on the hilariously clever Ugly Man over Vendetta's nice Sweat riddim. Ugly Man is somewhat similar to Ce'cile's hit Changez tune which she goes down the rollcall of dancehall artists and say why they aren't quite up to par, she hits old school dj Zebra the hardest saying "If ugly was a crime Zebra him fi stay inna handcuff!" Ugly Man is thebest track on the album by far.Also check the somewhat out of place Murderer, showing a different side of the artist, Macka goes over Liquid's Petty Theif riddim to voice a song about anti-abortion, and as the album went on, I found it was the album I most constantly referred back to. I'd also recommend the Tanya-like Your Mistake, a song about having a man who is incarcerated, which rides a grogeous Nyah drum as Macka shows off the versatility.And then there are the hits, which I am SO tired of (due to no fault of Macka's at all): Bun Him with the notoriously average Black-Er over Big Yard's Wild 2 Nite riddim; Chase Money over Dave Kelly's underused Bad Gal riddim; Lexxus & Benz over Firelinks' Chaka Chaka riddim; Done Already (1 of the other #1's here, the other being the aforementioned Bun Him) over the Thriller riddim; the 2 Cobra combinations and of course Mr Teki Back over the Miltary riddim.I just dont like it for some reason! Macka's style is on more of a hip hop pace which is way she stays best with the older sounding hard pounding riddims such as Shams' Baddis Ting riddim backing one of the finest efforts on the album, No Fren No Mate.Overall, I cannot recommend this album, but its largely based alone on my tastes. If you have been vibing along with Macka and enjoying the comback then by all means, go right ahead this is the album for you. Much of the newer material here is right along the same lines with just a few healthy surprises as well. For new fans, I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you to go look at one of Lady Saw's albums or particularly Tanya Stephens' latest, Rebelution for the feminine spin on dancehall. Macka's brand is something we've heard so many times before, change the look and the gender and you already know what to expect.

German Label Minor 5 Flat 7 has pretty much received a 'buy on label only' tag from me. To date, every release that I have gotten done by the label has been top notch both from the artists and the production. They have even been exceptional at times, for instance, their 2 most recent releases, My Hope by Anthony B and Rasta Still Deh Bout by Josie Mel have been the best the label has done (with My Hope being their single best effort ever). And over the years various releases by Turbulence, Lutan Fyah and others have definitely impressed.And all was going fairly well until I stumbled onto the rather odd but fantastically titled The Good, The Bad & The Blazing compilation. The title follows the artists, with Good being Junior Kelly, Bad being badman dj vet Bounty Killer and of course Blazing is the fire man himself Capleton. Before I heard a tune at all from the record I thought that Bounty wouldn't be too good of an artist for M5F7, their style is heavy heavy roots and the Killa has primarily made his name over the high tech digital styled riddims of the 90's and 00's. You won't find many of those at M5F7.Thus a certain strain of the album (all artists have 4 tunes each) feels somewhat odd. Capleton also finds himself in an odd spot, but not as odd as Bounty. 'Blazing' is not as blazing as he would be over his typical VP release, but he is more than comfortable riding M5F7's toppa tops, one or 2 of his efforts even sound as if they might fit into his most recent, more laid back Reign of Fire album.Junior Kelly on the other hand was made for the label and I would have more than welcomed a solo album (and would still in the future welcome) for him from M5F7. His Jah Jah's People is probably the best single shot here altogether. If it isn't then definitely the title belongs to his second effort All I Do. Each of his 4 tunes work (okay I'm declaring All I Do the best tune on the album). The Killer finds his best shot. The Prophet stays at a consistent level throughout, but probably his best is the closer They Don't Know.Overall, The Good, The Bad & The Blazing isn't necessarily a fumble. Were this a Fireball, Brickwall or any other roots label release, it would be one of their better efforts, but Minor 5, Flat 7 has declared and rewritten a certain level of quality for themselves. This one falls well short of that level, but does not fall below the ranking of 'average', not by a longshot.

I imagine when you have release as many albums as Sizzla has released and have as many albums released with your name on them, that you are allowed a little room for mistakes and they do and have happened. In Sizzla's case, an older album, Up in Fire was released a full year after it was expected, and he's had a couple of albums (Freedom Cry and Red Alert released with 2 titles which cross over from Euro-version to North American-version. But perhaps no bigger 'mistake' has been made on the exceedingly prolific Sizzla's behalf than the hybrid/mutt/mutant that is Burning Fire.Burning Fire, too, had its share of basic problems, it was originally called Reality (and programmed with the title) and then changed to the cliche' Burning Fire, then changed back to reality and then lastly released (without being reprogrammed i.e. your computer will recognize it as 'Reality') as Burning Fire again. The tracklist changed and ultimately ended up different than what was originally promoted the final tracklist is:1. Jah Is Love2. Love You For Who You Are3. Take Good Care4. You Gonna Need My Love5. Dress Immaculate6. Jah Knows Best7. No Bad Mind No Red Eye8. Buss Brain9. Be Yourself10. African Queen11. Sing a Song12. No Man Stand Alone13. World Leaders14. FireIt was also delayed twice and ultimately given the official release date of the date which was initially delayed. I'd bet a $100 to a bucket of chicken that Sizzla himself had little if anything at all to do with it. The biggest travesty here is that the songs that are on this album. . . aren't really 'for' this album. Lets examine:Jah is Love is the same song from the Jah Knows Best album; Love You for Who You Are is really You're Better Off from the JKB album; Take Good Care is really Somewhere Oh Oh from Taking Over which was released 4 years ago in 2001; You Gonna Need My Love is the same song from the JKB album; Dress Immaculate is Profile from Taking Over; Jah Knows Best is the title track from JKB; No Bad Mine No Red Eye? It's really My Time Your Time from JKB; . . . I can stop there, of all of these songs 8 come from Jah Knows Best and the other 6 from Taking Over. It took me a second to realize it and when I finally did, I was hoping that they didnt take Subterranean Homesick Blues which was a Ras Records exclusive for their album (JKB) and a reggae tribute album which they did for Bob Dylan and sure enough the final track 'FIRE' is really Subterranean Homesick Blues.If you have neither bought nor heard Jah Knows Best or Taking Over then you might actually be pleased with Burning Fire, its actually not a bad record just judging it musically, I'd say the best tune is Jah Is Love, which was my favorite from the JKB album, also like Thought for To. . . I mean Sing A Song and Far. . . I mean Be Yourself.Overall, you should only buy this if you missed Jah Knows Best and Taking Over, however, as a fan the two relatively high profile albums are probably already somewhere in your collection. And shame on Penitentiary Records for putting out something like this! Both Taking Over and Jah Knows Best were released in Europe.

The effects that Sizzla Kalonji has had on the reggae world can be felt on nearly every album from a new and burgeoning conscious reggae artist that you pick up today. This album, Roaring, by unknown lablemate of Sizzla, Lion, was no exception. Having clearly taken from Sizzla's style and added some distinctive innovations to it himself (i.e. a constant hard hitting baritone, booming voice, and less chanting), and having learned from the priest's teachings, Lion (or Roaring Lion in Jamaica) managed to make a significant album in his debut, and only album to date. This one is your typical outstanding Xterminator fare, backed by the best riddims in the business and obviously self-backed with a great talent for penning lyrics, Lion rips Roaring, basically from the beginning to the end. Songs like the opener Universal Pain with Malachi, the very catchy and near dancehall sounds of Show the Youths the Rights, show his lyrical capability. I also like Home, None Shall Escape, Helping Hand, the Truth and Rich and Switch. My favorite overall being Universal Pain. And Can't Be No One Else is fantastic as well. This one is for everyone that likes the Sizzlas, Turbulences, Junior Kellys, Warrior Kings and Jah Masons of the world as Lion fits right in that category. I say pick this one up. Overall, its very good, there's a certain level of maturity in the way Lion wrote this record that kinda makes it better, and its all for the upliftment of less fortunate in the end.

Undecided in what to give this record. A 3.5 would have been perfect. Its a decent album, there are some really good songs here, and there are a few bad songs. My favorite is easily She's All I Got, 10 Love Commandments is also really good, and of course Mr. Man with Alicia Keys is amazing. I also like Time Stand Still on which Wyclef Jean sings backup. Stay Strong and No More Playing games are two very good songs as well. The remix of She's All I Got is horrible Fabolous ruins the song with his rap, and another song call Cheated is pretty weak. Overall its a pretty decent record, if you really really really like Alicia Keys then you'll probably be entertained by Cozier's first album.

If you happen to come across Ghetto Revolution, and its the first taste of Sizzla's work that you have experienced, consider it as pretty typical of the extremely high level material that the priest has put out in his career. To the initiated, Ghetto Revolution is a return to the old for Sizzla as he has been taking straight flack (somewhat deservedly) about his 'experimentive' phase with his music, making the harder edged and even slack tunes that he's made. This album, in concept (I'm in no way comparing the 2 in quality), to his opus Black Woman &amp; Child, because it is an album mostly dedicated to love, and the mental feelings and emotions that come along with love, and its power is slyly evident to the most seasoned Kalonji listener. Largeup Greensleeves for obviously putting some high amount of thought into how it was presented, as they have always done with his albums for them (Bobo Ashanti, Royal Son of Ethiopia, Rastafari Teach I Everything). And musically, it is very very good as well, absolutely void of bad tunes, my favorites are the title track, the ultra smooth Jah Will Be There, That's Why (my absolute favorite) and Love the Little Children. I also really like Won't Stop. Ghetto Revolution has a much softer edge than some of Sizzla's more recent albums (i.e. Taking Over, Blaze Up the Chalwa and Blaze Fire Blaze especially), this is no doubt one for the fans of roots reggae and rasta renassaince reggae, dancehall fans, get Blaze Fire Blaze if you haven't already. I also I have to reccomend Sizzla's underground record Hosanna for a harder edge.AMAZING!

Beenie Man typically does his best work on his big albums, and Youth Quake is certainly not one of his big albums, but nevertheless its pretty good. It seems to be a very very low quality production, the cover and back pictures are very bad, and not only is the track listing on the back missing a track #6 put its also out of order.On the record itself, like I said, its pretty good , it has 2 tracks Mek Use a Life and Unu Fi Follow We that has Beenie recording when he was a young teenager, but you can see his skills on Mek Use a Life. Unu Fi Follow We is pretty bad. My favorite tracks are Selassie, Study Me and Badder Than Di Rest, the albums best song. He also has Leave Dem with Yellowman which is decent. If you have never bought a Beenie Man album then don't start with Youth Quake, but if course if you are a fan then you'll have 3-4 good records that you've most likely never heard before here.

(4.5 Stars)I wouldn't have a problem at all were Jah Mason the type of artist like several of his peers who routinely released more than one album per year. Mason certainly has the vibes and lyrics to support such a recording schedule, but he prefers to not do so.Mason is infinitely overlooked and underrated to an almost unbelievable state, however, with last year's big hit Princess Gone, he figures to now become one of the artists on a higher stage as it has led to a big touring schedule and his first VP album of the same title. Luckily he hasn't limited himself to the typical productions squads and has returned to Nocturne Records and (presumably, although you wouldn't know it by looking through the album because their are no liner notes) Israeli producer Piloni. The label and the producer were the 2 factors which led to Mason's best album to date, the massive Never Give Up from 2004. Rise is not as good as that record is, but its still of very very high quality definitely to be heard.Rise's vibe is a little more dark and murky than Never Give Up's (which was dark as well, but not this dark). The production, for the most part, is cut down, you don't here the big spectacular sounding riddims, its maily Mason doing his thing. But honestly, as it turns out, the approach helps, as there are times on this record that Mason absolutely hits a masterclass with his flow.The best tune here is probably the super-combination which reunites Mason with his former mentor and boss Capleton from David House. The song is the title track. And as Mason is typically called a higher pitched and less animated version of the Prophet, the two work very very well together and it appears an actual combination, not voiced at 2 separate times, they actually acknowledge each other, its big, definitely need to hear that one! The other great material comes through combination with singer Zeno. The two tunes they do together I'll Never Break Your Heart and Them Come Friend You are very very good, kind of interchangeable, but very good nevertheless. And on I'll Never Break Your Heart you notice the level I was speaking of, Mason just goes after the simple drop as hard as he can and Zeno kind of brings the track back to center but Mason eventually can't contain that flow and they both take it together.Also good here is the hip-hoppish Wah Gwann, big big hard tune. Them Girls Want Bling, which scared me when I first saw it titled, assuming Mason had made a tune about typical things now, its not like that at all, instead it becomes a condemnation of such things and women who chase such things. Also check Music Them Want which ends the album on a very hard note (over the same riddim used for Sean Paul and Vegas' Haffi Get di Gyal).Overall, the album is about half pure roots, the second half goes almost totally hard dancehall vibes. But its still the Mason, still outstanding vibes, outstanding lyrics and the usual things that you've come to expect from the artist. This album is pretty hard to find and with the release (in a couple of days at the time that I wrote this one) of his big VP album, it'll probably be overlooked undeservingly so, but I have both, and its a little better. Get them both, but start with Rise if you can find it.BIG ALBUM!

While there is certainly some impressive music on this album, undoubtedly when given he knowledge of the circumstances under which it was recorded, that information becomes the single most impressive feature of this album. Bushman's latest offering Signs was recorded all live, it was recorded with a band backing the talented singer. No high-gloss overproduced mixes by an over aggressive producer, no doubled voices, no nothing, just the singer and his band, and thats the way true roots music should be recorded.The result is about as heavy a vibe I've found on a roots album since last year's smash Ghetto Life by Jah Cure (thus the title of my review). I've never really paid a huge amount of attention to this artist, but from now on I have to admit that he'll have my ear whenever he chooses to release an album. The knock on Bushman has always been that he sounds a lot like veteran allstar Luciano, and while that certainly is the case, if you really have to sound like someone, Luciano isn't a bad one to sound like (not saying he does it intentionally).Signs is a very good album that is not without its missteps, most of these missteps exist between two songs, the title track which I just do not like and the odd One Tin Soldier which finds the reggae singer doing his impression of KENNY ROGERS of all people. The good here, which is heavy is very very good. The best tune of this album is the opener Sanctuary, you walk away from that song just thinking that Bushman sings like a GROWN MAN, that tune is a big tune. Also check Downtown, Light It Up, the amazing Creatures of the Night (heavy heavy details), the tune Lonely which is a combination track with Niki Burt and the first single Lighthouse on which Bushman invokes the spirit of the legendary Red X Peter Tosh.Overall, of course if you're a fan of this type of music you have to try Bushman's Signs, while being on the scene for quite awhile now, its evident that Bushman is getting better and better, and with Kings of Kings head Colin Levy on the boards (whose been blazing true fire for about a year now) this one hits magic when it hits its highest and it keeps going.

(4.5stars)There are very few artists that I consider it an actual utter joy and a privilege to be able to listen to day in and day out. This type of status is usually far more reserved for the artists whom I grew listening to and reached adulthood and still had a definitive interest in vibing and even most of these still have conditions. I consider it a privilege to be able to listen to VINTAGE Sizzla Kalonji or Sizzla at his best; I consider it a privilege to vibe VINTAGE Lady Saw and these days, Lady Saw at her best. More still are artists like Beres Hammond, Luciano, Mad Cobra and General Degree who have struck a chord with me for one reason or another; the most former based on the ridiculous quality of their music overall and the latter two largely based on moments of sheer brilliance (when I was a kid, I flat out wanted to be like Mad Cobra when I grew up). While I wouldn't necessarily rank these artist ALWAYS on my favorite list every time, they will rarely drop a track and definitely not an album which I won't pay attention to, as I said, for some reason, I just rate them always. Slowly but surely joining this group of artists are two up and coming strong artists, Lutan Fyah and Natural Black. For his side, Lutan Fyah has established himself as one of the strongest lyrical talents to come about in a very long time. Blazing a course which reminds many (myself included) of a younger, less `experimental' Sizzla, Fyah is seemingly on his way to being amongst the truly greats in the game. Then there is the delightfully hard to find, underappreciated but well on his way Natural Black. I first became aware of Natural Black around a decade ago when his actual recording schedule was quite slow but he was absolutely doing some impressive material on local stage shows which made many draw comparisons, both performance-wise and vocally, to Buju Banton which for the young singjay was very impressive at the time. Musically speaking, he also caught on fairly quickly. Coming to Jamaica from Guyana to be virtually homeless for awhile, Natural Black also struck a chord with several producers (most notably Beres Hammond) who voiced the artist to creating some very very impressive pieces. Early hits included pieces like To My Bonafide and Songs With Feelings and Natural Black was on his way to reupping Guyana to Jamaica following in the footsteps of the great Eddy Grant. Even before pushing out very strong material, Natural Black, as I mentioned, was a mainstay on the basis of his very strong stage show, through his years in Jamaica he has definitely developed musically, but it is to the credit of his own natural ability that from day one Natural Black has always had a wicked stage show (even more like Mega Banton as an artist who need not have a big tune out necessarily to make an appearance on a big stage show). Through those years he has also developed his music side.Natural Black has grown into such a truly wonderful artist to listen to largely based on the years he spent toiling on the reggae scene as an artist with a name but lacking the big hit and big investment to push his career to that next level. While it definitely is unfortunate that it took such a long time for him to make his successes (he actually came to Jamaica in 1995 I believe), it is a positive on the other side as his `arrival' on the big time stage of reggae coincided absolutely with his arrival as an artist whose skill level could match his newfound fame and popularity. The later stages of his development (and perhaps he is still developing) were spent recording for some of the biggest names in the roots side of the business. Before ultimately making his big break at the hands of dancehall genius Vendetta, Black had voiced for the likes of Bobby Digital, Shocking Vibes, Beres Hammond, Calibud, UK outfit Stingray and many other strong producers under whom he honed his craft. The result is easily one of the most skilled all around artists reggae music has to offer and an artist who personally, I rank amongst the greats. I can think of not many names who actually worked so hard, not at being prolific and jumping on every any kind of riddim which came outta road, but actually worked so hard before even entering the studio booth at developing himself into a roots artist who feels equally comfortable on a dancehall vibe as he does on a roots vibe. I'm not the only one who Natural Black struck a chord with either as he has developed to a point to be generally involved in a small group of artists who are capable of delivering a JA #1 song currently. This group is even more exclusive as generally only the top notch, or soon to be top notch artists who are on a good swing in their career have such capability and this is a group which changes like the wind. Natural Black's music has also done work back home. Guyana's reggae scene has greatly improved over the past decade and one can largely make a credit to Natural Black for playing a role in developing that vibe. After becoming the first Guyanese born artist to have a JA #1 tune in 2005 with the MASSIVE Far From Reality for Vendetta's Seasons riddim, Natural Black's successes have further highlighted the reggae talents coming from the South American country (which is a place I absolutely love visiting). We now know names such as Ras Mac Bean (who himself has been doing great work on the European side), Yahadanai, First Born and others. Perhaps even more importantly now, we know the name Walter Fraser whose Vizion Sounds label based in Guyana has been the home of such a wonderful roots reggae vibe that he has attracted some of the finer talents, in all of reggae, not just Guyana voicing the likes of Luciano, Fantan Mojah and Buju Banton, the label even delivered albums from names like Luciano and reggae greats Big Youth and Gregory Isaacs. Earlier this year, Natural Black voiced an album which I think may prove to be a landmark occasion as Vizion Sounds had recently opened a studio which cost millions of dollars to build (with the Guyanese government actually supporting reggae music, a beautiful beautiful thing). That album, Cool Nuh Black for Vizion Sounds may prove to be a huge piece and musically speaking it was one of Black's better, more long-lasting efforts.Even that album was the suddenly very prolific artist's second of the year as earlier he dropped the very interesting Jah Guide album for legendary Jamaican dancehall producer King Jammy on Greensleeves, his second GS album to date and I wouldn't be shocked at all if within the next year or so (and I think Greensleeves is now marking him, like Sizzla and Nasio, as an artist who can deliver an album every year) if he made his VP Records debut. First, however the Rasta is going the most popular route for roots at the moment and making his debut for Cousins Records with the very packed Love Gonna Conquer Evil, now his sixth album to date (and I believe his very first album, World War has just been re-released, so everyone pick that up as well). Speaking of producers, no producer at the moment can swing a bigger hand on the roots side of the music that Byron Murray at In the Streetz who, again hooks up with Black, having done production for some of the vibes earlier from Black's career. Over the past 18 months or so alone, Murray has produced albums for the likes of Sizzla Kalonji (I-Space, currently my choice for Reggae Album of 2007), Luciano, Norrisman, Lutan Fyah and Norrisman (and I'm sure I'm missing someone here). Murray has effectively been making some of the strongest roots in recent years and taking the next step as well, recording so much, that he has albums full of material from artists amounting to a virtual whose who (he also did a Turbulence album, knew I was missing someone, and Jah Mason) or modern roots reggae with just a few exceptions.These albums have been very solid as well, setting Natural Black with very large shoes to fill and he handles it with ease dropping what I would call the second or third best album of his career (his best will always be Spiritual Food in my opinion, this one rivals Far From Reality, the album, as the second best however). Love Gonna Conquer Evil is definitely one of Murray's best productions overall and I find it interesting that when Murray's label, In the Streetz had just started and was almost exclusively dropping dancehall riddims (the actual owner of the label is dancehall artist Mr. Vegas) the cultural Natural Black was even a favourite back then showing a great recording chemistry between the two. If you've been paying attention Love Gonna Conquer Evil is Black's take on some of those riddims which you've heard the other artists go on and thankfully some spice is thrown in as I THINK Black sucks the last bit of vibes out of these riddims (and now its time to retire them before you drift into Minor 7 Flat 5 territory of recycling vibes four and five years old). The album opens with the very strong and cool You Should Take Advice which gets the album off to a very nice start, Natural Black has a style of writing which its almost like a very peaceful warning, he almost always takes the more serene takes on things and says what could be better as opposed to what could be worse, he almost reminds me of a chanting version of Luciano lyrically. You Should Take Advice is a very strong tune to start the album with and that is always important. Following up is one of the bigger tracks on the album altogether and a song which was a decent hit here for Black, Never Leave You Lonely over Murray's I Shall Be Released (aka the Bondage riddim) from a few years back, it isn't my favourite practice to dig so far back for a tune but the tune (much like Sizzla's King of Kings on his MASSIVE I-Space album) is one of the strongest here and it wasn't overplayed back then to the point of exhaustion and it doesn't break the vibes here none at all. Another strong track follows on the very nice No Cry Cry Smile, Black's take on Murray's Desperate Lover riddim (which is almost always used for a love song), Black's tune isn't the best on the riddim (think that honor belongs to Turbulence or Norrisman) but he is definitely amongst the finest offerings on the riddim.Then the album really gets going with the more melodic tunes which are its true strength and per Black's free flowing style as well. The next four tracks make up four of the best five tracks Love Gonna Conquer Evil has to offer. Check Black's take on Fyah riddim on a song which easily rivals Jah Mason HUGE Couple Chalice a Day for the riddim's finest offering, Rather Be Your Friend. The song really shows off Black's ability to deliver his message in a more melodic style without changing it noticeably and is definitely worth many spins here. There is a Place is another one, very very strong tune over what is probably Murray's signature piece, the Street Swing riddim. The Free Life riddim is the platform for Black's superb Shame Face, which possesses one of Love Gonna Conquer Evil's finest choruses. Lastly, in that row of tunes is the track Love Rastafari which is MASSIVE and my choice for the album's finest offering altogether. The song was a originally a one off for a label (which I believe is now defunct) and very underplayed, but definitely all who seek guidance within Rasta need give it a spin, it falls back on the melodies but you really just feel that vibe down to your feet, very very powerful track!The balance of Love Gonna Conquer Evil is full of absolutely wonderful tunes (and ODD track listing). Check Out of the Pit of Hell over Murray's nice This Morning riddim, definitely needs to be heard. The VERY STRONG Don't Paint the Wrong Picture just a very simple and stripped down song which is Murray's style of minimalist production at work, highlighting an artist in the best light possible. The `title track' here isn't really here at all but the tune listed as Let Jah Love Abide over Murray's (most minimal) MoBay riddim is actually better known as Love Gonna Conquer Evil. And I have to recommend the beautiful `Cry For the People' which is better known as No Skylark. And the album ends with one of the best (the fifth I spoke about outside of the row of 4) tunes altogether, I Won't Forget flows in Murray's style of throwing in (usually at the end of the album) a very nice acoustic track which is always nice, I Won't Forget is amongst his very best and the type of song usually gives the artist free reign to do what they will, not many are better at that than Natural Black.Overall, you definitely won't forget this one should you decide (correctly) to pick it up. Its wonderful now that such an artist is receiving this level of attention that he is now releasing albums and recording at a steady rate and establishing a name, not only locally, but internationally as well fans are sure to not forget. Tune in not only to Love Gonna Conquer Evil, but Natural Black as a whole, an artist well on his way to establishing himself as one of reggae's MOST CONSISTENT champions.

Tracklisting:Sizzla1. Top of the Line2. Do What Jah Say3. Love in the House4. Nah Move Freaky5. Set the Place a Fire6. Babylon Get Demolish7. Fat &amp; Yu Clean8. Jerusalem9. BattlefieldCapleton10. Dem Running Out11. See Dem12. Red Pon Backra13. Jah Jah Lift My Head14. Words of Mind15. She's so Fine16. Log On Girls17. Hot Stuff18. Can't Stop ThisI've always really liked this concept of putting 2-4 artists on an album and in somewhat of a head to head (but not really on this one)format, having them put their brilliance on display. This one in particular (which of course reminds one of the awesome Forces of Nature on Brickwall, featuring the same 2 artists)is a very good compilation. Personally, I'm a huge fan of both the priest and the prophet, but especially the priest, and this album is a very useful addition to my collection. On the music side, there is a tune on this album by Kalonji called Jerusalem that I've loved from the second that I've heard it, and it stands as the best tune on the album in my opinion. Thats a great honor on this one that is absolute clean of bad tunes and has some very good other tunes by both artists. I really like Dem Running Out, the ultra smooth See Dem (which really would have fit in well on Still Blazin'), the aimed Red Pon Backra, Can't Stop This and the odd sounding Log On Girls all by Capleton. From Kalonji, I love all the tunes he has on this one, but especially the aforementioned Jerusalem, Do What Jah Say, Love in the House, Set the Place a Fire, Babylon Get Demolish and Battlefield, but like I said they all are very good. Overall, I say get this one no doubt, its one of the best Jet-Star produced pieces ever (and thats saying alot because they've done great things)and its very popular, having been released in certain areas about 8 weeks early, its been bubbling high on the reggae album sell charts (New York especially)throughout the late summer. Its also a pretty good representative of the type of work that both artists have been releasing of late, and its no doubt a great place to start for someone who is maybe just starting to get into the music.

Jah Mason has spent most of his career toiling in the shadow of the likes of roots artists such as Sizzla Kalonji, Capleton, Buju Banton and Luciano, all the while aking truly powerful music from beginning to end, and releasing 3 albums in the process. I was actually surprised to see his work on Amazon.com, good suprised, and Never Give Up just happens to be his most complete album to date. That is saying a lot as his previous works (Working So Hard, Keep Your Joy, and Unlimited) were all excellent pieces.This project is ultra unique in the fact that none other than Israeli music master Piloni is playing on it, and producing it. This is what Israeli roots reggae sounds like, and its amazing. Jah Mason's style is not too dissimilar to that of Sizzla Kalonji, they sound nothing like each other in voice, however, their tendency to build to a fever pitch, or just change on the drop of a hat is something they both do constantly. The best tune here is probably the downright amazing See Them Crying, the song is just so huge, and it features the unknown (to me at least) singer Iqulah on the hooks, huge tune. Also love the opener Gideon Start, Mount Zion High, big tune Mother and what is probably my second favourite Righteousness, the song just makes you feel good.Overall, the album is of course deeply Rastafarian based and the interesting thing about the cover is that if you look close enough you can actually see several faces of Rasta in shadow, including Bob Marley and Prince Emmanuel. But when you break it down to what it actually is, it is a masterpiece, from beginning to end from an artist whose acclaim on the world stage of reggae music is long long overdue.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

The issue with compilations (particularly in reggae music where so much of the shelvespace is flooded with them) is and has always been song selection. First and foremost the quality of the songs and secondly the source of them. If you have a compilation with great songs that are available on many other albums, then you have a problem. Likewise, unheard average or below-average material is still average or below-average material.Such is the case in Jetstar & Charm's Toe to Toe #5. A lot of average'ness'. However, it also suffers from the fact that these songs are also found (unsurprisingly) on other albums (by the same label) which gives it somewhat of a low effort project.Featured here are reggae superstars, Sizzla Kalonji and Junior Kelly. Sizzla is the naturally gifted dynamo who can pretty much stop and compose a tune out of thin air no matter the time of day. Kelly, on the other hand, is a slower paced (but more consistent) artist who carefully takes his time on all of his output to always put his best foot forward. While the success level of Kalonji has to date alluded Kelly, he is still amongst the most revered and respected artist of modern roots reggae.This album doesn't draw from the absolute best of the artists (now that would have been a very good album). Instead it flows from the most recent work the artists have done for the UK based JetStar (both of whom routinely release albums there). The best song here is probably Sizzla's Some How, although Kelly's Exile is not too far behind, neither is Kalonji's slightly amped but still slightly special Out to Nothing, which somewhat reminds of older Sizzla-styled djaying over a modern dancehall riddim. Also check Kelly's Straight Up and Black People and Keep in Touch from Kalonji.Overall, in a Toe to Toe fashion this one is not a fight of the best efforts from the artists certainly. But it is very 'competitive' (wouldn't we love to hear a Kalonji-Junior Kelly combination tune after all these years?). In the end, its an average and unspectacular project to be best appreciated by those who want to get a feel for the artists. In the battle, Sizzla lands the heavier shots, but Junior Kelly lands more:Split Decision: Draw!

A seemingly forgotten and terribly underrated production house for fine dancehall has been Main Street. The rather successful label, was a virtual assembly line for dancehall artists and albums in uptown Kingston. Headed by Danny Browne, Main Street released several albums for artists such as Red Rat, Goofy (now Mr G), Mr Vegas (for whom he produced the massive Heads High and the subsequent album as well) and General Degree. Degree was rather easily the most skilled of all Browne's main artists (with respect to Vegas), and before Browne retired from the dancehall business and turned to making gospel styled reggae.General Degree and Browne's style of production almost fit like hand and glove. While Degree developed his dj style in the era when hardcore ragga dj's ruled and were the order of the day, his style is much more of a fun vibes driven style, he would air on the side of Beenie Man, rather than Bounty Killa so to speak. Browne's production style was a very bouncy style drum programming driven style which eventually (and arguably even today) would become the preferred and most used style in modern ragga (and with the current trend in dancehall to 'revive' older riddims I think its only a matter of time before some young producer invades the Main Street vaults).And I have to confess, when I was much younger, Degree was one of my favorite dj's. Apart from the artists with the tough persona (i.e. Mad Cobra, Bounty and Supercat) who I followed, Degree had a wicked wicked and underrated flow and seemed to understand dj business about as well as anyone from that mid to late 90's era, and even though he wasn't the most popular internationally (or even locally generally), he made sure you paid attention to him at all times.Which is probably why I'm writing a review from a nearly decade old album in Bush Baby. Although Degree hasn't been 'overly' prolific during his career, BB is definitely amongst his finer projects even still and arguably, catching him in 1998 was at the height of not only his popularity, however at the height of his skills as well.The best tune here is without a doubt the opener, Traffic Blocking, which despite its horrible 22 second long intro, eventually dips into the song which even today is probably still Degree's biggest hit. The tune, which rides the same Filthy riddim which spawned Vegas' massive hit Heads High speaks about all the beautiful 'traffic blocking' women out there and was a HUGE local hit here the second it was released and was (reportedly) the first tune voiced for the Filthy riddim.Aside from Traffic Blocking, the 16 track filled Bush Baby is a wonderfully done album and a nice introduction of the General's style: Check the sickly clever Man a Yard for all the guys from Mandeville, Manchester and Mon'tego Bay. The nice nice combination with extraordinary UK singer Maxi Priest, Baby Boo featuring the same annoying intro from Traffic Blocking (in a shorter form, thankfully).Definitely check Boom Boom over the Rotten Rich riddim, excellent tune and an excellent example of how and why Degree's simple and straight forward style is so effective. He almost never says anything or makes any point which makes you think deeply or meditate over, but he says just the right things to bring the vibes to the highest point, and that era of dancehall which birthed him was generally all about that. I'll also recommend Miss Gotti and the nice closer Bag a Things, both are fine efforts and both ride my absolute FAVORITE Main Street riddim ever, the hard hitting dancehall picture perfect Baddis riddim. Miss Gotti was the hit, Bag a Things is the better song, but its all about the Baddis which keeps an almost dancehall '2 drop' pace and is still one of my favorites.Also, lastly worth mentioning are the Red Rat combination Visit Yu Yard, just a nice fun track over a fun Japanese styled riddim and DEFINITELY check the big tune Dash Him Out, which sounds something like a Mad (really mad) Cobra tune for awhile on the hook. Dash is Degree having fun going for that hardcore ragga stylee over a riddim from former Main Street artist, Buccaneer's oufit, Opera House.Overall, it is in great probability that you'll never be able to find a copy of this looooong out of print album. However, I'm more than giving it my complete recommendation as one of the finest examples of one of Jamaica's finest dancehall talents. So should you come across it somewhere, consider it your lucky day and pay the nickel or whatever the cost is and definitely, ENJOY!

Turbulence has been 'threatening' to release his group's, Higher Tribe, album for awhile and Join Us, which is officially a Turbulence release, is Higher Tribe's debut album. Overall, for such a young group you have to be impressed with their talent and you have to be upset that the cd doesn't make a larger distinction of showing who is who, despite the number of pictures it has (would have loved a caption record company) (Boogalusa)Now all that being said, Join Us is Turbulence's finest piece of work to date, undoubtedly boasted by his group's influence. The best tune is the brutally honest Based on A True Story, where Turbulence shares the story of his pure conversion from former troubled youth to upstanding Rastaman citizen. Also really really love the 'softened' dancehall tune Look Wock which is probably where Higher Tribe shows just how High they can get, Look Wock is crucial. We Are is a very good tune as well, also check Black Woman. The thing about Join Us is that where in the past, all of Turbulence's records were devoid of Bad songs, (they did include mediocre ones) Join Us, is all stellar tracks on top of stellar tracks, really really high production value, but laid back still makes Join Us a great one.Overall, while undoubtedly The Future and Hail to My King will be the 2 albums that will be pushed the greatest this year from Turbulence, Join Us may prove to be his finest piece of the year, and maybe his finest piece ever.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

(4.5 stars) The Art of War is Bounty Killer doing what he does best, calling out the best of his contemporaries and daring them to respond. When I say calling out his contemporaries, I mean it. Beenie Man and Merciless, of course, Baby Cham, Lexxus, Vegas, Gringo, Buju Banton (why, i don't know) even Sizzla and all Bobo Dreads for that matter, find themselves as the targets for Bounty's most accurate lyrical bullets. While he obviously places a great deal of his emphasis on Beenie against whom he's been warring on and off for the last decade, it Baby Cham who recieves the harshest of Bounty's disses throughout the album. Check Just Dead (formerly Just Dead Cham) and Likkle Dread Bwoy. Likkle Dread Bwoy is probably the best all-around track here, BK takes aim at Baby Cham, Lexxus, Vegas, Buju Banton (seemingly for no reason according to BK's website) and surprisingly Sizzla(who I admit is my favorite artist). I say surprisingly because VP chose to include this one on the album despite releasing 2 Sizzla albums this year alone and at least one a year since '98. Another good cut here is the excellent Warlord Nuh Business on which, he agains fires at the usual suspects, but in truly fine lyrics and to an excellent riddim. Also check Which One, Look Good the counteraction to Beenie Man, the fantastic Sumfest and the All Out War remix. The only complaint I have for this one is on 20 tracks of the same type of music after a while, the last few tracks seem a bit monotonous. I have to give BK credit however for practicing what he preaches as he mainly manages to stay away from hip-hop and offer a completely dancehall album.Overall, I say that despite being a truly Jamaican album and maybe hard to understand for pure English speakers, I say that hip-hop fans can probably like this one, Bounty Killer fans, obviously this is one for you, or if like me you like to hear master Dj's clashing on a world-class level. Can't wait for Warhead's album of the same nature.p.s. Bigup VPRecords for adding a &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; label instead of choosing to edit the album.

This version of this annually released 2 disc set is exactly what it should be. Its jam packed and it has the some of the biggest names in the dancehalls. On the first disc there are several very good songs, and I cannot pick which one I like the most. There are cuts like New Name by Prophet, Bad Gal, Bad Man by Cecile and Elephant Man, Straight as an Arrow by T.O.K. and a vengeful I am Who I am by Bounty Killer. Also on disc one is a song called Wah Gwaan which is okay, I mention it because it is by Assassin who I have heard so much about but never heard and his flow is decent, I'd have to hear it on a better rythym for sure. On disc 2 there is a song called Thugs 4 Life, which despite the title is a very good track by Ward 21 and Wayne Marshall. Also, Bun Friend Enemy by T.O.K. which might the best of both discs. Defend the Girls though is the highlight of disc two as it marks the return of the Empress Lady Saw who rides the rythym absolutely flawlessly.Overall, notice what Greensleeves is doing, they are obviously promoting the new Elephant Man record Log On as he is featured on no less than 7 tracks, and WARD 21's album Mentally Disturbed as they are present on 3 tracks. Get this album, only thing missing is Beenie Man and Sean Paul, nearly every other prominent djay is here including Vegas, Kalongi, and Merciless. (not including Baby Cham of course, who doesn't play outside of Madhouse)

You almost HAVE to biggup VP Records for re-releasing the lalabella riddim album! The riddim which spawned 2 rather massive hits and was one of the few roots riddims which could pack a dancefloor at the time, the lalabella was absolutely massive!In retrospect you can probably call the lalabella the father to newer riddims such as the I Swear, the Drop Leaf and the Seasons in terms of the impact. The riddims which are strictly rootical often crossover because their appeal goes so much farther than just Rastaman on country road, the lalabella made it to the dancehalls in JA and it packed the floor.Without a doubt the 2 best songs here are the excellent If Jah (here known as Why Be Afraid) and Are You Satistfied by Tony Rebel and Ras Shiloh respectively. Rebel's song is probably the best, offering the strongest vibes of all the hammers present on the album. After those, you have to check what was another big hit Ghetto People's Song from the incomparable Everton Blender! Ghetto People's Song is huge, the riddim just takes over, almost going into a march like anthem, where you can imagine many people walking to the beat of the song.The lalabella is one of the few riddims where I think its downright impossible to pull a bad vibe off the riddim. If all else fails the riddim itself will take over, so you get unestablished and forgotten artists like Shanty Plus making absolutely beautiful and inspirational music such as Moving East. Moving East is a big big song! Love the record! The album shifts to another riddim at the end, the best of those tunes being I Saw Selassie combinatino by Lebanchuleh and Sugar Black.Overall, the lalabella is somewhat of a collector's item in this re-release which I more than appreciate from VP (reminding me who re-released Black Woman & Child a few years ago now). Sometimes I literally just NEED to hear it, I would have loved a clean version of the riddim, but I can't complain, the lalabella is a beautiful beautiful thing.

(3.5stars)Mad Lion has always been an artist who is really hard to appreciate on an album, lyrically he's not that strong, and he's always been paired and compared to Supercat who is a master, which didn't help Mad Lion too much. To fully appreciate him and what he does, you have to actually see him perform as his energy on stage is pretty much second to none in contemporary dancehall.Predatah or Prey is a very hip-hop sounding album done in Mad Lion's Jamaican tinged way of vocalizing. The riddims are pretty much all hip hop, in fact, outside of Mad Lion, Bounty Killer and maybe Terror Fabulous, no dancehall artist could probably ride these beats.My favorite song is probably Give It To Me with Total, I like what Total adds to the song, and its a pretty unusual combo tune. I also like Weed is All We Need, Sensamillion, and the odd operatic sound on territory.What else can I say? I consider Predatah or Prey to be a hip-hop album, I'm not a big fan of rap, so its not for me, but there are a lot of hip hop fans that might like this one. Get it if you like maybe Kardinal Offishal, Bounty Killer and maybe even DMX, as it is a very hard and jagged DMX-sounding record.

And my French isn't even very good. I've known about Admiral T. for about 2-3 years now. The first time I actually encountered was even before then at a concert which I believe was in Canada, but having virtually no idea who he was and speaking even less French that I do now (i.e. none at all) I all but ignored the fast chatting do from Guadeloupe. He had skills definitely and an immense stage presence and absolutely commanded a great deal of attention.Fast forward a few years and now that I currently split time living in Jamaica and St Maarten (Dutch territory) I've gotten better in touch with the artist as he is amongst the most played reggae artists in the French territory in the north as Guadeloupe is pretty much a hop and skip away. Also, I picked up Wyclef Jean's Welcome to Haiti album a few years back and featured prominently on one of the best tracks on the album, Famn Kreyol was Admiral T; and lastly I've also started paying a great deal of attention to an artist by the name of Sael. Sael, from Martinique, is apparently one of the Admiral's best friends and the two have recorded together and perform together in France (I actually picked up learning French to learn what Sael was saying on his records!)And although I was quite disappointed to see that none of the tracks on this, his first album to reach the west (and maybe his first altogether) was sans a Sael combination. What is here however is a flow so lethal it had me wishing he would just drop it altogether and go English for just ONE TRACK. I'd actually compare his style to a mixture of yard chatters Idonia and Mr. Peppa (whom Admiral T. actually looks a lot like). Yes Admiral T. pretty much always chats too fast for my ears, but his overall command on the entire album is very very impressive and I definitely plan to keep a closer eye on his career in the future as well.Probably my favorite track here is Rantre an Dans La. The song features an almost sickening flow by Admiral , as he absolutely LOCKS OFF the riddim and breathes fire through the entire tune. `Rantre' is Exhibit A when I point to a track which I wish had been voiced in English because it amazing.I'm also quite fond of most of the combinations here, despite Sael being absent . Probably the best combo is with Haitian superpowers Kassav on Fos a Peyi La. The song almost has a soca feel to it, or at the very least an uptempo pure dance, dancehall vibe, but fairly near a soca vibe and I love the changeup when the female takes the mic. And I can never remember a point where I was happier to see TOK EVER! Their combination with Admiral, Wave Your Flag is a big dose of well welcome patois chatting from Bassie right before the Admiral takes it and re-kicks the tempo back into high gear. Another of the fine combinations, Number 1 with Rohff, another chatter (who is far less gifted than the Admiral), does another good changeup as it is a pretty straightforward sounding hip hop vibe.I also have to mention the title track which is the ONLY one-drop on Toucher L'Horizon. And it set the album off on the right and proper pace, but I wish they had actually waited awhile to mix it in, track #10 would have been nice. And I definitely have to mention Retour au Pays Natal, which has a completely Cuban vibe, sounding like something directly out of Buena Vista Social Club.If you can't tell my only real critique with Admiral T on Toucher L'Horizon is that the album gets into streaks where the songs almost blend together and you almost forget that you're listening to a new song. With his style, he is usually (and it is a pretty good idea) these huge epochal dancehall sounding riddims which are where his best material does lie, but every change of pace on the album is more than welcome.Overall, I'm definitely recommending Toucher l'Horizon. it's a big big album! It says a lot about the talent coming out of France and the French Caribbean; Not only Admiral T. and the artists featured on his album, but Sael, the young and controversial artist Krys and Lyricson as well, there is some nice French talent coming up. At the head of the class is Admiral T. so definitely start here!

I read an interview some time ago where a younger Bushman mentioned that his then how when he was coming up, his then manager set him up for a recording session with UK big producers Stingray Records. He said the Stingray crew were friends of his manager and she insisted that he go to record, and he did not want to at all, but he eventually relented and went to do the project.The result was a very strange project called A Better Place which was released on Artists Only records in 2002. My Meditation is essentially a re-release of that album, far better mixed and cut to its absolute most polished finished project. . . And, at best, its just okay.I just became a fan of the artist within the last 2 years and spent the majority of that time tracking down the rest of his albums, all of which, that I found, were of grade A material and hearing him often bump and grunt his way through some of My Meditation is just disheartening.My Meditation could probably best be described as what could go wrong when a producer (or the artist himself) misuses Bushman's incredible baritone voice. Listening to the Tosh-influenced Back Weh Vampire and I can't imagine what either were going for with the downright bad singing on it. Same goes with the ultra mediocre Mama as well. Bloody City, hip-hoppish Gangsta Life and the beautifully written Doesn't Matter all come somewhere between below average and average. And of course there's the obligatory Bushman detour tune, this one being a Kenny Rogers cover, Love Will Turn You Around.The good here is the album's best Fill My Cup and the original title track A Better Place. Let it be said that lyrically, I might go as far as calling My Meditation one of the artist's biggest achievements, obviously he wrote the tunes on the plane ride over, not sitting in Stingray studios.Overall, as difficult as it seems to be for this artist to get out albums (when compared to many of his contemporaries), it seems almost a waste that one of the bigger chances of his career be spoiled by what appears to have been just an uncomfortable situation. Although, beautifully packaged and presented by Stingray and JetStar, My Meditation is easily the worst album of the Nyah Man's career.

This a relatively important compilation of modern roots reggae music. Much in the same fashion of a previous release from the same company, Flag Flown High which documented Bobby Digital's Digital B, Rough Inna Town does a fine job in establishing the musical history of one of the finest production houses in reggae history, Xterminator.Xterminator Productions, headed by Philip 'Fattis' Burrell has served as the launching pad for some of the biggest artists in recent reggae history, most notably, both Luciano and Sizzla Kalonji. It has also seen some of the bigger artists, such as Capleton, Cocoa Tea and Ini Kamoze pass through its halls.All are present here and more and several more. Rough Inna Town is a very very thorough project and the results are very fine. The best tune here is probably the underplayed and underappreciated combination of Sizzla and Ninjaman, Who Is Laughing? Very different tune, and a welcome combination, right after Ninjaman's return to top form. Also check Sizzla's finest solo effort here (he has 2) the awesome Life's Road which sounds like it might have been from the same sessions which produced his debut album, Burning Up.Also definitely worth checking is one of the finest tunes of Luciano's career, Gunzalis, over the same riddim which backed Sizzla's King of the Earth. I was also happy to see both young and old represented. Old in the form of a wicked wicked combination of Luciano and foundation dj's Charlie Chaplin and Josey Wales, the tune has the link of old school dancehall style and classic Xterminator production values.Young is even more represented by the up and coming Chezidek on his debut album title-track Harvest Time, also a nice link between Prince Malachi and Turbulence on the solid We Pray Jah, from the same riddim which backed Sizzla's awesome 'The World' (although i would have preferred had they given Turbulence's On My Way to Zion on the same riddim a spin here). Also check the remix of Kamoze's Hill and Gully Ride in typically odd Kamoze fahsion. The only real weakpoint here is LMS' r&bish; We Will Make It over the Taking Over riddim.Also one of the best features here are 2 dubs. One of Gunzalis and an all out dub to close it up.Overall, check this one out if you are a fan of Xterminator, there is a lot of good info in the liner notes, we love reading stuff like that. I wish they would have included Jesse Jender and (Roaring) Lion, otherwise, between including all the well known and lesser known X artists (including both Malachi and Mikey General) and grand combinations, Rough Inna Town is right on point.

2001 was a pretty unusual year for reggae music. Besides being about the usual slew of big tunes, it was about big albums as well. From Ward 21's debut, to T.O.K.'s debut, to Damian Marley's big album to Beres Hammond's last studio release, to Log On to Taking Over, it was the year of the big album.However, flying somewhere under the radar might have been one to trump them all. Cocoa Tea falls in the category of entirely too cool reggae singers. His voice is undoubtedly the answer to the question of "who sung that song" on so many tourists to Jamaica from trips years and years ago. For the type of music that he does, his voice is absolutely perfect, and despite his Rastafarian beliefs, his magic probably works best on the ultra-laid back tropical riddims and not the heavy roots, hard conscious sounds. All that being said, one of Cocoa Tea's greatest talents outside of the studio has always been in surrounding himself with some of the best talent on the island. So when you see that the man himself Phillip Fattis Burrell is on the board for this one, slowly but surely the results start writing themselves on the wall.The most interesting piece here musically, is without a doubt th opening title track. Absolutely melting over a riddim I thought long dead due to Sizzla's massive hit over it, Taking Over, Cocoa Tea offers what is either the single best or the second best tune on the album. If Feel The Power isn't the best song here then the song which is the best and the second single if I remember correctly is Sweet Life, a truly magical setup by the veteran. The only true mis-steps here are the two 'WHO' tracks "Who" which is Cocoa's take on the 2000 US election is an odd choice in its lack of metaphors, its pretty literal and for such an accomplished writer as this artist it doesn't seem to be his absolute best; also "Who Let Them Out" is a tune with a great concept that never actually picks itself up. Besides that, check the awesome Auction Block, Hot Again and the unusual closer Sliding. Also not to be missed is the huge combination track L.O.V.E. which features no less than 4 other artists (Louie Kulcha, Ken Serious, Anthony Selassie and Silver Cat). Really big tune, also like Moses Law and True Love.Overall, I say no doubt about this one. I'll perhaps always file this one in the category of 'missed it when it was better' time has without a doubt affected some of the luster on this one. But such songs as the title track and Sweet Life will forever be great tunes.Good Music, go get it.

Gentleman has been a favourite of mine for a few years now, ever since getting an earlier album of his, Journey to Jah. He is one of the few Europeans who have actually made a way for himself in reggae in JA where he is actually respected, definitely evident by the class of artist with which he collaborates and the producers who voice him. Gentleman might just be Europe's best reggae export since Maxi Priest (wouldn't a Gentleman/Priest combination be interesting? hmmmm. . .)This album Confidence, is even better than J2J was. The album, 20 tracks strong, has been doing serious business for the artist for the last 2 years and is truly, even before listening to it, very interesting.Its a very well put together project just in terms of who Gentleman works with. Combinations with Barrington Levy, Cocoa Tea, Anthony B, Tony Rebel and Ras Shiloh, all very impressive. Add to that the fact that working the boards on some of these pieces are JA's finest in production. Vendetta, Bobby Digital, Calibud, Black Scorpio, AL.TA.FA.AN., and Firehouse. Gentleman calls in the big weapons which are typically reserved for big projects from artists such as Sizzla, Capleton and Luciano.The results are very very impressive as well. There are no bad tunes here, and I find new tunes that I like each time that I listen to it. The best tune is always Intoxication, however, over the immortal Drop Leaf riddim. Also love Caan Hold us Down with legend Barrington Levy and Gentleman spar Daddy Rings.Superior, big big tune, big plush sounding tune excellent hit. Love the combination with Cocoa Tea, Be Yourself ("cuz their identity is coming from the nozzle of dem gun, but i and i identity is coming from the Nyabinghi Drum!"), excellent tune. Another big tune is Face Off with Anthony B, one of the bigger tunes from B's recent My Hope album. Mystic Wind with Tony Rebel. All that being said, the best combination on the album is probably Blessings of Jah with Ras Shiloh over a timeless Digital B riddim (same riddim supported Capleton's Ton Load).I could go on and on (and I have) liek For the Children, over the same riddim as Sizzla's massive Dry Cry. The excellent Rumors and After a Storm (probably the best old school sounding tune on the album).Overall, Confidence is just pure magic, listen to it and know Gentleman is without a doubt the wickedest white bwoy doing reggae's music in the world.

Call me biased if you want to.I first heard of Lutan Fyah about 3-4 years ago on a great Lustre Kings compilation called Culture Dem. His tune was called No More War and there were a ton of artist on the album that I hadn't heard of and some of them, to this day I don't know what became of them (i.e. Shadrach) but there was something that set him apart from the rest of the young artists on the compilation. His tune had a 'finished' feel to it that even some of the more established artist didn't have on that riddim, No More War was excellent.Apparently the people at Lustre Kings felt the same way about the artist as they released his first (US) album, Time & Place and it was a big big album, and it showed (along with his official debut, Dem No Know Demself) that he had more than enough vibes and lyrics to go throughout an entire album and carry it. Lutan Fyah is full of talent and he's at a point at his career where he's either going to fall into the category of artists such as Junior Kelly and Jah Mason where he'll make great music, have the occasional big hit and be continuously be appreciated for it on some level, but never make it to the big stage of such artists as Sizzla, Capleton, Luciano and Anthony B, or he can set himselfup to fall into that category of truly massive artists.If its based on talent alone (and its not) then he'll fit into the latter category. Phantom War is downright awesome! I don't know who woke up at Greensleeves over the last year that realized that people were calling more for real roots music over the continuous head-knocking dancehall that made up 99.9% of their releases and that roots artists, outside of the obligatory annual Sizzla release could sale to the reggae massive and prove profitable, luckily they chose to involve Fyah early in that eqaution, and they've proved to be whole-heartedly more reliable in releasing roots projects over their typical 'coming soon' dancehall schedule.Phantom War has 19 music tracks on it, and one video track, they are all worth listening to and I don't know how I'm going to deem one the best of them all. The way GS presents the album is also a big thing, nice and simple, but powerful cover and the liner pictures are nice as well, always been GS' strength to make the project look well done, regardless of the music itself.Big songs here are plentiful, check Wi Nah Gangsta, big big song dismissing the flashier and more 'viable' gunman lifestyle of the gangsta for the more clean Rastaman lifestyle. The tune shows more of Fyah's normal dj style, but he leaps in and out of flat djaying, singing and full on chanting. The big song here (and the reason why I think GS checked him for this album) was Rasta Still deh Bout with Josie Mel (also on Mel's album of the same name) the song might be my favourite on the album, but I'm very accustomed to playing it regularly, big big tune. Also check the title track here, the powerful Phantom War explains whats going on and who the real enemy really is. And its interesting, Fyah has much more of a story-telling style in that he won't just drop and rely on the methods of some of his Rasta peers where you'll say nothing but cliches, and ultimately resort to the punchline of "Emperor Selassie IIIIIIIIIIIII", the man, lyrically has truly studied his craft.What I am calling the best tune here is Wipe Those Tears. I loved that tune from the first time that I heard it, late last year, its a really really poignant tune and it works works works! Also love Mother Earth's Healing; LOOOOOVE Screaming For the Poor over that big Triumphant riddim, have yet to hear a bad tune on it, Fyah does an excellent job. Poor Little Rich Girl, This Fire, U Left Me. . .Still Deh Deh! Love that tune! Turbulent Time, Snares of Death! What can I say, its full of big big tunes. This is the album that should show everyone what Fyah is capable of, been listening for a few years and still he gets better. AND, check the video, worth watching as well.Overall, this one is almost madatory. This is the groundfloor for an excellent career. Ultimately, I think Fyah may maintain an Anthony B like position in that he won't be the one closing the big shows, but just as popular and more consistent than his peers (in his case we'll be looking at Turbulence, Fantan Mojah and probably Jah Cure as the dominant singer), just take a listen to Phantom War, from a purely lyrical standpoint, you won't find too many better in or out of JA.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

So in the early summer of 2004, I found myself on a visit with a friend who had recently moved from our place of birth, Jamaica, to a beautiful island called Curacao. One day while I was there, I heard playing on a small hand radio the voice of an angel.While I am still trying to ascertain if that voice belonged to an actual 'angel' or not, I know it belonged to the human being that is Izaline Calister.I'll say it flart out, I have no idea what she is saying on any of these songs. . . Okay maybe I have somewhat of an idea, because the liner notes go out of their way to explain to non-speakers of their beautiful language (which I believe is called Papiamento) exactly whats going on here, so thankfully I believed that they planned on a few me's buying this one. GOOD JOB to Network Medien.This album is flat out spectacular! The vibes (which really make the whole thing for me, and might do the same thing for me if I could actually overstand her) are so strong at points that you're almost moved to tears. (no I am not afraid to mention that the opening track brought tears to my eyes)That first song Awaseru (the Rain) is the absolute best tune here, vocally, instrumentally as well. Instrumentals are a large part of this album, it kind of plays out as an Afro-Carib Jazz album. Also on the album is my 'angel song' Aworo (Soon), just a beautiful song, nice vibe all through it. Also really like Mi Sopi (My Soup) Dia Liber, Ta Abo So . . . Whatever, I could go on and on. Saying which tunes I like on an album usually works but not on this one, because I really like all the songs for one reason or another, Awaseru is just so powerful and makes itself the most impressive of the bunch, but were it not here, I'd be absolutely lost as to which would be my favorite. Izaline and her band are masters at work.Overall, I say get this one if you, if you like jazz, probably a good start to enjoying this, but if you just enjoy fine music you should have no problem with actually feeling this one. All the different types of instruments and sounds just meld into each other, I even think I heard a butcher clinging knives together at a few points. It kind of made me felt how I'm sure most Americans feel when they hear dancehall music for the first few times, where you just can't pick it up at all. But I don't care, Krioyo is an excellent album and a must have for lovers of all beautiful music.

I just don't know about this record. No song besides Missing You jumps out at me at all. I'm all about listening to some great soul r&b romantic type of music, but I think Case just went too romantic on it, which I didn't think was possible. In my opinion he just went too soft, just doesn't have one particularly powerful song on the entire album at all.

Its always refreshing to hear when Norrisman comes back with a release. The results are always solid and ORIGINAL. Norris, being probably one of the most unique talents in all of reggae, coming up as a pure singer, then a songwriter for King of Kings, then a dj and finally ending in his style now which is sort of a pure singjay/chanter which doesn't sound too different, but is one of the most unusual in music right now.I often refer to artists like Junior Kelly and Jah Mason as underrated and underpublicized. Norrisman is just flat out forgotten at times. Having made his name partly due to his relationship with King of Kings where he no longer resides (and partly through being Turbulence's uncle) his music is always quality but he won't necessarily be the preferred artist for the big riddims (i.e. would have loved hearing him on the stress, drop leafe and/or seasons riddims). However his career is definitely on an upswing (due largely to the title track here) and he has been getting more and more fine opportunities.Home & Away (as the previous reviewer said, in a fine review by the way) is the direct result of his big hit of the same title which mashed up 2005 and is probably his biggest hit since his earlier hhit Persistence. 'Home' becomes Norris' 5th official release (only the 3rd in the states I believe, both Hey Woman and World Crisis were not released there).What can I say about Home & Away? Like the title track the music here on the whole is absolutely gorgeous. The best track is without a doubt (even better than the title track) Seh Dem Bad. The song weaves an easy sounding vibe into a conodemnatory exclamation definitely not to be missed by reggae fans. A similar tune later is the excellent We Are the Creator, "we are the creator, they are the separator!". Very very good tune on We Are the Creator and a Norrisman exclusive. Many times, even at the top of music songs can become interchangeable, Norrisman is the only artist in reggae who can do HIS songs.Also check the fine Love Makes You Alive, and what I'm calling the 2nd best tune here This You Must Know. This You Must Know is different because of the very nice hook over an expanded typical reggae one-drop which oddly enuff has an r&b; twang to it.Definitely check the title track (which you have undoubtedly heard by now should you have made it this far in the review) and After All the massive combination with Lutan Fyah (which I'm glad they saved for this one, and I'm assuming the saved the even better combination with Natural Black for his album next month). Mr Vegas' right hand man Byron Murray handles most of the production duties, however, the odd production here and there, such as the fine Feelings Deep Within by the late great Coxsone Dodd, give the album a nice overall completed vibe.Overall, definitely pick this one up. I always do a list at the end of the year of the best reggae albums of the year (and while Lutan Fyah is currently at the top of that list, with Natural Black, Jah Mason again, Bounty Killer, Anthony B, Tanya Stephens, Beenie Man, Gyptian, Buju yet another Turbulence and yet another Sizzla yet to come)Home & Away will undoubtedly be somewhere on that list. Home & Away is definitely Norrisman's biggest statement on album ever, and looking forward to see what comes next from reggae's most forgotten man.

It is absolutely amazing- the number of tunes that Sizzla has written in his career, unquestionably the most prolific writer in reggae history, and it also helps that he is the reigning undisputed best lyricist in the game as well. Sizzla's style of djaying and singing has always worked for him, and he has certainly put his skills to great usage by cutting as many songs as he has while doing around 15 albums now.This particular record here is very very good. As always he manages to serve up the huge hits and bigup the Rastafari at the same time as he covers various topics. The best song here, in my opinion is Beautiful with its fantastic rythym and Sizzla's flow is as good as it gets. I also like Yes I Get High, Give Her the Loving and Make Love, they are all top notch Kalonji and he gets his message across completely in them all. As you notice on every Sizzla record, there are no completly wack songs, there are some that are not his best work, but they, just as music alone, are really pretty decent.A mistake with this one by the record company Greensleeves, Sizzla's straight bashment track Woman Dem A Fi We should've been here, as he has several songs here which speak about similar messages. Overall, eat this one up, I gave it a 4 because I don't think that it is as good as Taking Over on VP, but as it stands alone its probably a 4.5 or a 5, go get Taking Over today, then go and get Rastafari Teach I Everything, the next day. Amazing.

Since learning of the artist, I've made a point of listening to Norris Man's output constantly, and while his output has definitely been less than 'constant' its generally been of a very high level.Norris Man lyrics are truly sick, the man says some amazing things, has some huge vibes behind him, but sometimes he kind of seems stuck between flat out deejaying, chanting and singing. Its odd that Norris Man's nephew and burgening superstar, Turbulence, also seems to have the same problems at times (I guess its a family 'curse' a 'curse' that a lot of reggae artists wish they had). He seems to be at his best when he's somewhere between full on singing and full o chanting.Norris Man's best album ever was released last year in the UK, called World Crisis, big album, but Better Your Soul is a pretty good album. The best tune here is without a doubt Hold On to Your Faith, real big song, probably the best one I've ever heard from Norris Man and the one where he puts his best foot forward and just goes from the heart, I can see him in the studio just losing it when he's building the hook on that one. Also really like the title track, Mek Jah Guide You and Jah Loves Us, Blessed are Those is pretty good as well. You get the idea, when he sticks to the cultural roots style he hits and hits big.Overall, its a nice vibe Norris Man brings no doubt, good artist, constantly humble, constantly developing, expecting big things from him in the future.

This discussion of modern roots reggae music can go no deeper than one or two paragraphs without some mention of the almost disturbingly wicked Midnite Band. Over the past 15 years, the St. Croix native band has built not only themselves, but the entire Virgin Island reggae scene into a burgeoning reggae juggernaut. The band STAYS on tour constantly, throughout the year, performing at sold out venues large and small alike and carrying some of the purest form of roots reggae available anywhere. And while they may ultimately lack mainstream exposure (of course) or even a heavy amount of support here in Jamaica, their peers are the ones who give them their ultimate respect as several well known Jamaican reggae artists admit to spinning Midnite constantly.The band, led by brothers Benjamin, Vaughn- lead singer and and songwriter and Ron- lead guitars. Has built its reputation all over the Western Hemisphere by performing from coast to coast any and everywhere it was wanted. Originally establishing itself as a force on the east coast reggae scene in tiny Washington DC venues, the band now is a favourite and constant fixture on the west coast as well, routinely performing at the roaming festivals and events to sold out audiences from all over the country! The reason? Perhaps greater than any other single entity in reggae music today, Midnite has been able to string together COMPLETE consciousness without an ever so slight as a waver. The band has also opened doors for many VI artists literally and figuratively. As it stays on the road so frequently, the 'downtime' is used to promote and produce for wicked VI artists such as Dezarie, Ikahba Stone, NiyoRah and Danny I.While their music has often been described as unusual (and downright odd) Midnite's soul mission is singing for His Imperial Majesty. Vaughn Benjamin's bag of lyrics is about as deep as anyone's making music today, so deep it is that in early 2006, he released a book of poetry and even embarked on a spoken word tour for that! Benjamin's style of CHANTING is so completely simple that its unique. He just chants! Sometimes in a mumbling style, but if you really listen to the words, you will undoubtedly be amazed.This album, a 'collaboration' of sorts between the dominant band of the VI, Midnite, and the dominant label, I-Grade Records, is one of 3 in 2006 alone! They keep a Damian Marley like touring schedule and a Sizzla like recording schedule. Jah Grid, like most of Midnite's work is very strong. And while I certainly wouldn't recommend it to the new fans (its entirely too deep)(newer fans should pick up Ras Mek Peace or Nemozian Rasta), older fans of the band will definitely rate this album amongst the group's finest. It is definitely more veiled than other releases (which is saying a great deal as most of their releases can be described as such) but this album especially.The best tune is probably the opener, the sick sick Enter which almosts flows like a lesson. Definitely want to have prior knowledge of whats going on in the world to fully grasp the meaning of the tune which Vaughn flows so easy, it almost sounds like he's making it up as he goes along (and he just might be).Besides that, check the wicked My Joy, which i first noticed because it flows along the same riddim which backed NiyoRah and Pressure's MASSIVE Afrikan Chant tune from Niyo's most recent album Purification Session. My Joy is, curiously, a more aggressive track than most of the tracks on the album and it stands out to a great degree. Also standing out is the lyrically SUPERB Kin Dread. The song is a unifying tune against babylon, which isnt rare at all, but what is unique is the brilliant way Vaughn builds the lyrics building and making small points throughout the entire tune.Having been a fan of the band for awhile as I mentioned I've kind of made a point to take awhile to listen to the entire album SEVERAL times before making a judgement as to its worth. Midnite's style is much of an acquired taste (which I'm STILL working on acquiring, my favourite Midnite album, Nemozian Rasta took nearly a year to grow on me), but Jah Grid, might be even deeper than that gem of an album.Other highlight tracks include one of the most melodic tracks you'll ever hear from Vaughn, the wicked Before I Lose My Strength, the song is a heavy heavy praising tune which maybe has the best and most dynamic hook on the entire album as Benjamin actually ups the voice to a near full on SINGING style. Check the ultra cryptic YHWH to be both entertained and confused at the same time: "choose before a place where no choices be, Haile Selassie spoke of these issues in specificity!". Just typical Vaughn Benjamin style giving you just enough to keep you interested and leaving you to figure the rest!I also have to recommend one of my favourite tunes altogether from the group, Royal Habits! Royal Habits is well well strong and preaches on how one should keep oneself and maintain oneself. The combination here features the unknown Jah Rubal, a bredrin of Midnite's who sounds a little like JA dj, Determine. Definitely check out Third Eye, the song on which he appears.Overall, I'm rather cautiously recommending Jah Grid for Midnite fans. Stay far and far away from the album should you be a recent fan of the group for at least 5-6 years (but definitely make a note to come back to it at sometime in the future)! Midnite's vibes are not for everyone, I think even perhaps the Benjamin's themselves would admit that (although you wouldnt know that based on their recording and release schedules) but if you are truly able to appreciate their vibes consider yourself lucky and amongst the special chosen few. I have a friend down here who is a producer and he probably said it best when describing Midnite's vibe: "Somewhere Bob just asked Peter if he had that new Midnite". Do you? Maybe you should.

VP's D'Soca Zone is essentially a carry-on partner to their excellent Soca Gold series. And it's timely, released on the eve of Carnival, the album typically packs some of the potential road march favorites.Expectedly, the best thing that can be said about the 6th 'Wukk Up' (and presumably ever other edition in the series) is that it is absolutely a fun listen. There is something on here for you I can all but guarantee you, regardless of what kind of music you listen to, something on this album will get you moving on some level definitely.The best stuff tune here without a doubt is the opener by posterboy Kevin Lyttle, who drops a massive shot on Home for Carnival, the hook on the tune is so cool. Also check the excellent Genie by Tony Prescott, Sucker by Sanell Dempster, Waisteline Shotz by Mr DJ and Fire Me Up by the much talked about Bud. I also liked both tunes by Da Bhann Inside ah de Fete and Dun De Place, featuring Giselle and Buke respectively.Overall, (this is probably the shortest review I've written in years) I'll stamp the seal of reccommendation on this one and I'm on my way to Carnival! Something here will definitely get you going, the last Soca Gold album was nearly essential, but this one isn't too far behind, huge huge vibes.

I admit it. Being a guy, I bought this cd for the cover and the live performance on the hyper cd alone. However, track # 12 alone is worth the money. The collaboration with Dave Hollister is just amazing, and if you really like singing, and good singing then you won't being able to take it off of repeat. Last Night with Lil Mo' is also outstanding but, I Told You (Track 12) is one of the best songs i've ever heard.

I consider myself to be a relatively new listener when it come so soca music. Having just gained an extreme interest in the music, despite my almost constant access to it, within just the past five years, there is still much about the modern age of soca and even more of the calypso eras which I don't know about. Thus, I am always on the lookout to expand on, not only my collection, but my knowledge of the genre as well. So, I pickup virtually every new compilation as well as older compilation which I can find (and when you live in the Caribbean, the shelves are JAM PACKED with soca comps, perhaps just as much as reggae); with the overall goal of being someday to have just as vast a knowledge base for soca that I do for my other favorite musical genre, reggae.Luckily for me someone at VP Records also has an interest which matches (well, exceeds, they actually spend a great deal more than $13.95 on these albums I imagine) mine. The reggae giant label routinely supprts the genre, much moreso than any label (major or indie) which has an established name in the music (with respect to J&W;). They have the 2 comps, which they release anualy, the MASSIVE Soca Gold and the nice D'Soca Zone, combined with the fact that just since the turn of the century, VP has released albums for soca acts, 3 Suns, Bunji Garlin and Edwin Yearwood, and have been the main distributor for our top rankin soca artist, Byron Lee & the Dragonaires. And just recently, they added soca king Garlin, to their extensive list of exclusive recording artists (they also have Yearwood signed as well).Then there's the Soca 101 series as well. The series which is actually marketed to the dj community, serves to fans as well to give them an update on earlier records of the exciting genre. Therefore, it isn't rare to get such an album and seen names like Bunji and Destra on one end and Arrow and Sparrow on the other end, and what can I say? I love it!The result of such planning is a wonderfully inclusive and even educational project (I dont really think they intended it to be educational hahahah!). This, the 3rd and most recent installment of the series is without a doubt the highwater point for the entire series, which goes to hope that VP chooses to do what they did with volumes one and two and release volume 4 sometime in 2007. And as soca continues to gain in popularity and in the VP Records release rotation, this series figures to become more and more of a priority.The album starts out well strong with two BOOMSHOTS. Both Lift Ya Leg Up by Spic & Co. and Jump and Wave by the Calypso Preacher are exceptionally strong. With Lift Ya Leg Up getting the album kicked off with a very powerful vibe, almost immediately making you happy that you bought this one (that's VERY important, I can't tell you how many times I've bought an album and spinned track #1 first and been completely disappointed with the purchase as a whole!). It is ever so slightly topped by the MASSIVE Jump and Wave which is a soca favorite, but the first time that I had heard the tune and I LOVE IT! Jump and Wave is more of the big and vibrant sounding soca which I enjoy and just make you wish you were in the midst of millions jumping!So the discussion for what my favorite tune from Soca 101 Vol. 3 pretty much began and ended between those two track. Until I heard track 3.The honor of best track without a doubt goes to absolutely divine De River by the Blue Ventures with Sanell Dempster on lead vocals. The song takes that big soca vibe and adds a wonderful vocalist to the mix and Ms Dempster is one of my favorites, she does this big track justice! Definitely worth the price of admissions alone just within the first 3 tracks, but there are several other tracks in the balance of the album which make it even better.Check the last 3 as well! The classic calypso vibe of Gu Nu Gu by Mighty Sparrow, is part of what makes an album like this such a wonderful idea. Of course keep going and check Byron Lee and the Dragonaires on Wine Down with an excellent effort, not only by Lee and the Dragonaires, but by a fine fine uncredited female singer as well. Lastly, finishing the album is the excellent (and probably 4th best tune altogether) Tempo by Ellie Matt & The GI's Brass. The song is a nice mix of not only vocals, but excellent instrumentation as well, with a couple of minute long brilliant passes of instruments alone!Other highlights include Sweatin by Krosfyah of course, always check them out in any situation! Check Moses doing pure soca showing his versatility on the fine fine Jump and Wine, definitely happy they made that inclusion of that one and Beenie puts forth a fine effort. Check soca VET Devon George on the strong If Ah Rude Ah Rude, sounding like a dancehall track wrapped into a soca vibe.Lastly, check out musically the most interesting track here, Showdown. Showdown is a strong combination between two soca bands, XTatik and Burning Flames, and its as crazy and as hype as you would imagine if you are familiar with the two groups, and just one of the several hidden gems you pickup when you pickup and album like this.Overall, definitely recommending Soca 101, Vol. 3 and even the first 2 should you be able to find them. Its a wonderful series for the new soca fan in particular, I imagine the more established soca heads just might have ALL these tracks in the collection already. The vibes are at the top! And this after a fantastic year for soca music, hopefully looking forward to a great '07.

Besides taking their own music to the next level, the arrival of Midnite on the reggae scene in the mid 1990's also marked the arrival of Virgin Island reggae on the scene as a whole. Suddenly, unknown artists who were very talented, though un/underappreciated, were thrust into the spotlight and given the attention they deserved as much as their Jamaican peers. Even to this day, nearly a decade later, slowly but surely the world is beginning to become exposed to more and more of that talent as more and more even still are nurtured and are being pushed forth at nearly record pace (artists from the VI, particularly St Croix, sometimes come forward with an album with virtually no gestation period at the highest level). Not only are the younger artists such as Pressure, Niyorah, Star Lion Family, Abja and Army now gaining a great mass of attention, but some of Midnite's more closer peers are as well. Bambu Station from St Thomas and St Croix is held in nearly high esteem as is Midnite. The band, which is regarded as almost a lesser known version of their more well known neighbors and although the musical style of Bambu Station is not EXACTLY like that of Midnite, they have carved out their own special place in the annals of VI reggae, not only through their own music but DIRECTLY helping the younger artists in the form of pushing two fine projects, The Talkin' Roots albums, vol. 1 and 2. If you are interested in learning more of VI reggae, then definitely Bambu Station is an excellent starting point. As one of the most experienced and well versed collectives currently playing that vibes, Station is to be well respected and are amongst the most popular artists where VI reggae is played.Bambu Station has been directly responsible for exposing great younger VI reggae talents to the masses as well. Constantly backing various acts on the road and the larger stage shows on the west coast of the mainland US, the group has performed with the likes of Dezarie, Ikahba Stone, Pressure Busspipe and a slew of others as well. The extent they have taken to push the younger artists hit its peak on their two superb Talkin Roots albums (both I believe are for sale on amazon). The first installment of the two featured The Star Lion Family, Dezarie, Iba and lead singer Jalani Horton himself with the excellent band backing all the various artists. The second, and even more solid installment, featured the wicked Danny I, Pressure Busspipe, Ras Bumpa and Bambu Station bandleader, the nearly legendary Tuff Lion. Bambu Station has seemingly made it theri goal to make the entire reggae listening world aware of the roots rumblings and tons of talent available in the VI and they are more than doing an excellent job (and would love to see Talkin Roots Vol. 3 in '07! Although they have already scheduled their next release Chant the Lions I for later this year)Their style is one slightly more melodic and conforming to older styled roots from Jamaica. There are times listening to Bambu Station where you can literally lose your sense of time, they make some lovely rootical music and if you're a real fan of the music you would definitely enjoy their special blend. Although often compared to their more well known neighbors in Midnite, their musical style is slightly different from the Brothers' Benjamin. Bambu Station is slightly more melodic and straight forward and while probably not as overall spectacular as Midnite, they more than get the job done. Where Midnite teeters on the thin line between cryptically odd and brilliant, Bambu Station more clearly focuses on overall consistency. Their lead singer, St Thomas native Jalani Horton has a full voice although I wouldn't necessarily call him a singer. Horton's style is much more of an aggressive chant which bubbles nearly perfect over the fine backdrops Bambu Station provides. While Horton isn't nearly as lyrically dexterous as Midnite lead singer, lyrics sage Vaughn Benjamin, again, his type of vocalizing and writing works perfectly for Bambu Station's music.This album, Break the Soil is actually their third release which features strictly the band itself after 1999's super hard to find gem Congo Moon and 2003's excellent One Day release (which is the first I encountered the group besides a few singles actually). You can definitely see a maturing in the group and them gelling together, besides being their most complete work to date, they also stray away from the norm on a few tracks (both musically and lyrically) and even involve a nice female singer on the album's only combination the wicked wicked Chance to Grow with the lovely Reemah. Having almost strictly been listening to them as a band not for themselves but for other artists (I actually got both Talkin Roots after the One Day album) its very very interesting to hear how they sound on their own as a fully functional unit. The remarkable way in which they can sound so fluid as to sound perfect as virtually anyone's band (largely due to Tuff Lion's genius), but even stronger backing Horton, is definitely enough to warrant the price of admissions for this one alone, but thankfully Break the Soil is a fine album.Probably the first thing that I noticed about the deceptively massive 14 track Break the Soil (whose run time has it checking in at just over 71 minutes) is the time lengths of the tracks (I'm weird I know). Being used to the Jamaican almost cookie cutter dancehall track which, at such a fast pace, can fit 25 tracks on any given album and still be dangerously close to just a single hour long, it was immediately refreshing to check the 'richness' of this Soil, and the actual music doesnt disappoint at all! Break the Soil leaves nothing to be desired from the very first track, as the opener, Brotherhood, is definitely the album's finest offering.One of the faster paced tunes on the album and definitely one of the strongest musically, Brotherhood comes as a complete CHANT (and probably comes the closest to resembling something coming from Midnite's studio) and kicks off the album on a great note. The hook on Brotherhood is also probably the album's best and I'm not sure which tune the label (the fine) Mt Nebo, pushed as the single, but definitely I would not be surprised if such a tune was Brotherhood. Very nice track.I'm also very impressed by the aforementioned combination with Siter Reemah, the outstanding Chance to Grow. Reemah, whom I've never of, has a very mature soudning sing and its a nice contrast to Horton's strong strong chant. It is also one of the more lyrically pleasing tracks on Break the Soil as both Reemah and Horton are in fine form with their word selection. Speaking of fine form lyrically, definitely check the nearly epochal Who? (Litany of Liars) over a nice hard driving Tuff Lion one-drop riddim. You need to really check that first verse on the tune and the various ways in which Horton turns phrases and words (particularly the word 'BLACK') into crafting just a perfect vibe with his words. I find myself drawn (all the time) to the more lyrical artists besides just the music; my favorite artist of all time is Sizzla who I also consider one of reggae's greatest lyricists (when he's truly on top of his game) and listening to Who? I get nearly that same vibe as it is nearly just as crucial to me as top notch Kalonji. And again, check the track lengths, so no point or vibe is pre-empted for time constraints, Horton gets to make his full point.Other tracks worth checking include the track immediately following Who?, the lovely Bird's I View, again, lovely lovely lyrics, but the inclusion of a rather unusual saxophone (played by band member Warren Pedersen) even makes the tune stronger and a real highlight. That goes to the point of just going beyond the usual straight forward roots reggae making that you hear coming from the VI vibes, I LOVE that occasional change. The tune itself is about gaining a different perspective on one's self and giving thanks where you previously didn't think a 'thank you' was warranted, and Horton builds the point through a series of small stories about himself which is just brilliant.Also check Sing Upright (which oddly enough directly follows Bird's I View making that stretch of 3 tunes, tracks 7-9 the album's strongest. Sing Upright is an admonishment/warning to fellow artists and musicians to go beyond singing of material and competition issues which often are harmful to the music (Horton even mentions certain singers bragging of bullet scars!), and checking the male and female artists alike. The album ends on another nice note with the very melodic Injoy. Injoy isn't actually amongst the album's strongest, but its still a very very fine way to end an album. You may NEVER see them perform the tune live (and that may be because they NEVER do perform it) but it goes to show the difference between making music for music's sake and making an album, two different things, both of which Horton and Bambu Station clearly seem to overstand to the fullest.Overall, I started writing this review with Break the Soil as a 4 star album, then I wrote it in as a 4.5 star album before finally settling on it as a 5 star album, and I've been enjoying it for nearly a year now. While Bambu Station may be best known as almost a side dish to the ridiculous amount of vibes Midnite is currently pushing, more pieces like Break the Soil and they may become just as well known all over the world as that 'other band' from the VI. Break the Soil is one of the single best projects I have ever heard from a VI artist, ranking up there with Pressure's burgeoning The Pressure is On, Ikahba Stone's brilliant Troddin to Zion and Dezarie's stunning and groundbreaking FYA. For fan's of this music (well you already have this album dont you!) yes, it's that good. So should you track this one to the far corners of the reggae world (which you just may have to do to find it), the reward is there, 14 very very powerful tracks of some of the finest roots reggae being made in the VI or anywhere else for that matter.

This entire cd is just like so underrated. If you love Lady Saw's music you need it. Check out the live acapella version of 99 Ways, listen to that reaction. And the studio version of 99 Ways is tight as well. I really like Woman Sneaking with Red Rat, No Matta Me, and Picture on the Wall with Sanchez.

Ever since I've begin purchasing version albums (or riddim albums)I've noticed something. When they're good, you'll get a fantastic combination of great riddim and great lyricists at their highest level. Some of the best version albums, (Drop Leaf, 5th Element and Diwali)will have that combination and be thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.When you don't have that combo, what you end up with is something like what happens here with the Sleepy Dog. Veteran dj Spragga Benz proclaims "Old School!" at the beginning of his effort, School which describes the Sleepy Dog perfectly. The riddim itself is beautiful older sounding dancehall piece by legendary Steely and Clevie.Its a shame that TOK, Jahmel, Mr Vegas, Bling Dawg, Big Toddler and Elephant Man (twice) all fall to hit the mark on the Sleepy Dog. Elephant comes off as (something I never felt he would be described as) mechanical on his Nice and Sweet and Girls Anthem, both of which sound like they jumped right off Ele's tune assembly line and as if though we heard them before. Same thing goes for T.O.K. who might've faired better had they took one or two of their group to attack the Sleepy Dog.Throw in Buju's very mediocre Ride This as well as Kiprich's Mix Up on a similar level and you're not left with much goodness. Surprisingly, Famous Face, who I never heard of, places good on Mixing Board which becomes quite clever after awhile. The highlights of SD truly however (besides the riddim itself) is Red Square. Spragga's School is quite impressive, however Assassin's As a Man is downright MASSIVE! The young artist flows in and out speeding and pulling back and impressing all the way through and makes listeners want that Infiltration debut to come sooner.Overall, I think this one might have gone better had Steely and Clevie went after some older and more established artists. Mad Cobra, Beenie Man, Bounty Killer and maybe even Frisco Kid or Degree might have made this more impressive. As it is, its nearly worth the price of admission for the Assassin tune alone, but besides Spragga and fresh new face, there isn't much beyond that.

Now lets go wayyyyyyyy back, circa 1993. Then aspiring young singer Jepther McClymont, better known as Luciano who had earlier been introduced by legendary producer/engineer Philip 'Fattis' Burrel, by fellow singer, Jahmali. It wouldn't be actually until the year 1993 when we would see the first full length production of what was a massively growing relationship between the duo, in this album, Moving Up. However, looking back on what became of not only Luciano's career, but the life of the label, Xterminator, as well, is the type of story you which could only exist in reggae music.Even listening to the still developing artist at such an early stage in his development its not too surprising what became of The Messenjah. Even being on the cusp of a self-imposed musical exile which would last from late '93 until 1995, Luciano was still able to effortlessly weave his way through some of the toughest and top notch material then available from Xterminator. Luciano almost immediately would shoot to the head of the class, not only in terms of his label as he became the big man of Xterminator, headlining world-wide tours to packed crowds of adoring fans; but alos musically overall. The December 1994 death of the legendary 'Little Bimbo', better known as Garnett Silk, meant that there was a vacancy under the title 'dominant singer in roots reggae'.Nearly a decade and a half later and we're wondering if Luciano will simply take the title to his grave. His relationship with Fatis and Xterminator (which effectively ended before the turn of the century, reportedly because of Burrell's loyalty to the then young and up and coming Sizzla in a dispute between the 2 artists) proved very fruitful. Along with arming The Messenjah with a workrate unparalelled by any camp perhaps in the history of reggae (just check the ever-widening discographies of Luci, Sizzla and Turbulence to see what Xterminator artists have to offer in terms of actual productivity), Fatis also 'armed' the artist with what are arguably the two biggest albums of his career, Where There is Life and of course, The Messenger.Fatis would subsequently show a propensity for taking his artists debut albums and releasing them locally. Several (in the cases of Luciano, Prince Malachi, Sizzla and Lion) would reach the international shelves through vintage RAS Records. The START of this relationship was Moving Up. A more than solid opener to what has since become one of reggae's greatest careers. Luciano has changed much in the decade and a half since recording these vibes. Still present was the classic baritone voice which has aided making him the serious success which he is today.His writing hasn't changed much either as you could very well pluck almost any tune off of Moving Up and drop it right on any of his 40-something since.The best tune of Moving Up is probably the STILL well mighty Poor & Simple. The song, which has appeared on so many different compilations on various riddims, still retains much of it's freshness! It blends soooooooo well as the star of Moving Up, which is as expected, a very very laid back effort from the sublime duo's first outing. The whole union is almost perfect as Luci's departure coincided with Xterminator's harsher stance and more aggressive vibes.Also worthy of several spins on the Luciano 'light' Moving Up is the divnie I Believe in Music. I Believe in Music is the type of song that makes you want to just grab a woman and just rock on the dancefloor, no foolishness, just a slow rock, which is exactly what I'm sure both singer and producer had in mind. The two other relatively decent sized hit from the Moving Up album were Chant Out and Sitting in Limbo. 'Limbo', which would eventually do very very well for Luci is about as close to a dancehall tune available on Moving Up. The cover track is just so nice and so easy to listen to that you won't mind the relatively sudden change of vibes on the album at all. Chant Out is probably as close to today's Luciano which the album gets actually (and its hard to say, because as I've mentioned the entire album pretty much falls in line with his current works), as it the strongest of the very few tracks that heavily touch into spirituality.Other songs quickly worthy of a mention and a few spins: Do Me Baby, gifted with a nice Dean Fraser saxophone accompaniment, Fraser and Luciano have, arguably, even had a greater relationship than Luciano and Fatis himself. Check the realy cool and clever Samfie Lover, while Sitting in Limbo is probably as close to the dancehall as it gets, no other tune on Moving Up will have you have you rocking in that seat almost immediately, guaranteed!Overall, should yo ube so lucky to find this needle in a haystack style album, by all means pick it up. Luciano's official Xterminator & international debut is almost a collector's item at this point. Complete with Ras' hilarious misrepresentation of his name as 'Luciana', Moving Up also offers strong vibes. As is evident throughout his subsequent and ever-expanding career, you wont find ANY bad tunes here (even the title track, a remake of the television program, The Jeffersons, theme song is bearable), and you'll place yourself on the groundfloor of one of the most remarkable career's reggae has ever seen.

Out of all the various riddim albums that I've listened to over the years from all the various producers on all the various labels with all the various artists voicing them perhaps no other riddim to date has CONFUSED me more than the Bingie Trod.In just analyzing the riddim itself, you get a wonderfully beautiful and vibrant roots riddim which would seemingly make itself the perfect backdrop for some of the better cultural artist to make their best material on. . .Not so, something (which I have yet to figure out) is wrong with the Bingie Trod! Its unbelievable! May it be the tempo, it is one of the slower modern roots riddims, it actually sounds like a slightly souped up version of something right out of the legendary Count Ossie's studio. So the mystery comes when you see just how many and who fails to hit the mark on the Bingie Trod which is produced, surprisingly, by the epitome of dancehall mediocrity (with respect to Bling Dawg), Alozade.Alozade's first mistake was to voice himself for the riddim, strike one. The second was to go out and get his buddy Elephant Man, strike two; and although he does a decent job on Times Getting Harder, you wouldn't expect Spragga Benz on this type of riddim either, strike three.After that you go through and see Bushman, Richie Spice, Junior Kelly ALL fail to hit the mark on the riddim. Also, though these days he has shown to be quite the wizard with the pen when it comes to the Love Song, 2005's Artist of the Year Turbulence also misses on Love You; and Bascom X's rather unusual vocalizing completely scratches his Away Away; and shockingly Anthony B chooses to go just about slack on his Gi Mi Dat, and I'm wondering just what is going on!What's good here is the always dependable Luciano on his beautiful What is Man? Truly underappreciated vet and background singer Pam Hall scores a winner on her love song Ole Fashion, Jah Mason shows a fine effort on as well on his Nuh Time at All which was the message that every (or most) artist here should have went for. Sizzla Kalonji's up and down goes up here as he goes nicely over the type of riddim he established himself on, with his fine Break Down Babylon. Of course the coup de grace here is by far the opener, Jah Cure's massive Hi Hi is probably the reason this one received an album, the tune is one of the best of so many fantastic shots from the magically voiced artist.Overall, through all the mess here, the true winner is the riddim and you have to give Alozade his credit there, the Bingie Trod was easily one of the best riddims of early 2005 and the year altogether. And shame goes to the label, VP, (at least on my copy) for not delivering a clean version of this massive riddim, despite 'promising' to do so on the track list. I say go for the 45's on this one, you don't really need the cd. (Plus, if you buy the complete vinyl version you get Norris Man's wicked All Vanity and Chrisinti's equally wicked With a Plan, and a nice tune from the late Simpleton)

This was Sizzla's first album ever, and it seemingly opened the flood gates, as he's had 15+ in the following years! Lyrically, Burning Up, isn't the best Sizzla that you'll hear, but as it was put together so early in his, that is entirely excusable. It does contain some good tracks however like Can't Hurt the Mind, Gun Ting Don't Pay, Dis Ganstar, and the record that made me start liking his music in the first place Search Fi Hardcore, the entire album has a very rootsy feel to it, and in later terms, I'd probably say it sounds somewhat like the excellent Royal Son of Ethiopia album, not as good lyrically, but still pretty good. And of course all the songs are great as bad songs do not exist on Xterminator. Overall, I say pick this one up, if for no other reason than to see significant level of improvement in Sizzla's skills, not that this is a bad album, but where he's taken his lyrical ability since Burning Up is amazing, I wouldn't recommend it to newer fans of Sizzla however, its more of an album for indoctrined fans of his. Bigup Ras Records!

In what will probably be remembered as one of the best of recent years for the hardcore reggae fan, arguably I Wayne's debut, Lava Ground, is the crowning jewel of the entire lot of big albums released this year.The 25 year old Clifroy Taylor burst on the scene in 2004 with as much fanfare as any singer to emerge from Jamaica since the late great Garnett Silk, with the massive Can't Satisfy Her (which he claims he has never written to date, just sings it out of his heart). The eccentric artist almost exuded an agressive moral standard as he almost immediately began aspersions on everything from the current state of dancehall to a harsh and controversial categorizing of soca music. One thing that became apparent, however, was the lack of controversy involved in his music, it was clear, across the board, the artist was on a different level than most of his contemporaries.Lava Ground is probably the best new reggae album that I've heard this year and every time I listen to it, it gets better and better. His style is one of a singer on almost a dj's cadence, he can tackle riddims as a dj effortlessly and if it wasn't. . . beneathe him, I imagine he might be able to do the same to a full dancehall riddim.The best tune here, without a doubt, is the title track. Its a beautiful song given the complete workout and one of the biggest complicated hits for the artist. The album has no bad songs, but in the running for second best are Can't Satisfy Her (along with its unforgiving intro: "Unu soon get disease and die!") and second single Living in Love from the massive Hardtimes riddim of late 04. My choice for second best tune on the album, however, goes to Nah Draw Nil one of the single smoothest songs that I've ever heard in reggae music.Also check the big big nyah tune Kid Artist, the prerequisite (but still surprising) love tune Touch Her Softly, of course Cool as the Breeze, Bleacher, Conquer and Rastafari Liveth and I've basically just recommended the entire album!Overall, given I Wayne's ultra-strict moral code, its almost unusual to hear the lyrics coming from a Rastafari that isn't a Bobo, but its just as refreshing. Maybe I Wayne will be the reference point for future singers just as artists like Buju, Capleton and Sizzla have been for Rasta dj's. The wait for the second coming of Garnet Silk is OVER!AMAZING!

The mysterious and somewhat eerie story of Legendary Jamaican singer Hugh Mundell is full of highlights. Besides becoming one of the popular singers in all of reggae history despite not even living to see the age of 22, the world of reggae, players and fans alike, owe the singer a great big Thank You for 'discovering' his childhood friend, Delroy 'Junior' Reid. Mundell and his producer, the even more mysterious genius Augustus Pablo saw the talent in Reid at such a young and undeveloped stage at age 13 which today nearly 30 years later, the world is STILL vibing to.Reid, (who was actually sitting in the car when his good friend and mentor Mundell was killed) has continued to carry the flame for both his fallen spars and more than fulfilling on the potential they saw in him. Even today, with his now current career regeneration due to a combination remix of his biggest hit ever, One Blood, with US rapper, The Game. Junior Reid, has somehow, someway, other than just his sickly high level of talent, managed to find a way to remain important and current throughout his entire reggae career.Part of that goes to the style, which draws many fitting comparisons to fellow Black Uhuru lead singer Michael Rose. They sing with a voice that is both extremely fragile and strong at the exact same time, kind of like a harsh mix of Gregory Isaacs in his prime and Bounty Killa! The style is the original singjay, as they do actually sing, but almost always on a general dj's cadence of chatting. Combine that with an almost unnatural dedication to creating some of the biggest and best vibes the music has ever seen, and you have the type of career which is no run of the mill variety!This album, the Ras Portraits album, is basically a greatest hits record from the years Reid spent recording for RAS Records (1994-96), during which he recorded three studio albums, the best material of which comprise his Ras Portraits album. I, personally, LOVE this series because it almost always focuses on the big time roots singers (i.e. Dennis Brown, Cocoa Tea, Peter Broggs etc.) at some of the best periods in thei career, recording for the strictly roots RAS Records.My favorite tune here, and maybe my favorite of Reid's entire career (with respect to the original One Blood) is Anthem. The song is both message driven (a message which is not too dissimilar from the message of One Blood) and danceable as well! Which is a very unique combination outside of hardcore modern roots, but it is also a very smooth song and after several listens are you then able to pick up the heavy message which Reid tries to push across.Also check two really big songs which I feel like go a long way in showing Reid's style. Both Dread Locks in the White House and Grammy. The songs show the almost humorous spin that Reid puts on things to write about them at times, but when he sings them, the element of humor is virtually erased! Both are big big tunes with Dread Locks standing out, particularly because of what sounds like a LETHAL refashioning of the Bam Bam riddim. And Grammy is fun! Grammy is about Black Uhuru winning the Grammy and all the various people Reid encountered (he seems particularly infatuated with Whitney Stephens).Have I mentioned that I love the Ras Portraits series? Checking in at just 11 tracks, it flies by and nearly all the tracks are enjoyable.Definitely check the opener, All Fruits Ripe, whcih ultimately became one of Reid's bigger hits. The song is probably the most dance accesible on the entire disc and it goes a great way in showing Reid's 'dj' style as he almost completely dj's (in his own way) over the entire song. Also LOVE Rasta World Dance over a brilliant pure dancehall riddim which I kept on expecting Terror Fabulous, Silvercat or some other boisterous dj to jump on and help Reid attack at any point during the record!Of course, check the two big combinations. The MASSIVE Dance Nah Keep Again with Dennis Brown is one of the finest pieces on the album and a rather nice combination due to the contrast in styles of Brown's straight forward style with Reid's intergalatic style of singing. Then check the closer, the even bigger and almost epochal Not a One Man Thing with Gregory Isaacs. The song is HUGE! And even were Anthem not on the album, it would still, alone, make this Ras Portraits worthy of the price of admission alone!Overall, definitely stamping my seal of recommendation on Junior Reid's Ras Portraits album (and nearly everyone in the series which I've heard thus far). Junior Reid's career, almost criminally so, lacks the big and defining classic greatest hits set (to my knowledge) so this album may be the best you can get right now. But this album isn't 'settling' for anything. Junior Reid is a big artist who has withstood the test of time in reggae music, and this portrait goes a great deal of the way in painting him in an excellent light.

Were you to look up the term, 'Dancehall Singer' in an encyclopedia, you would probably find an individual who very much resembled Calvin Scott, better known as Cocoa Tea. The slight and dreadlocked Clarendon native with the sweetest voice in all of the dance has made an amazing career for himself by just fitting the stereotype, and then COMPLETELY blowing it out of the water. As one might expect the dancehall singer to be, Cocoa Tea is ultra laid back in his style and even cooler than the stereotype! Beyond the image are a whole heap of skills and experience to lay his trademark hat on, having voiced (and continuing to do voice) for some of the finest production talents Jamaica has had to offer over the last twenty years.Recording for such producers as Fattis for Xterminator, Bobo for Star Trail, Bobby Digital and King Jammy's over the years has earned Cocoa Tea the reputation of oen of the best pure singers as well as one of the most dependable artists altogether. You wil probably NEVER see a Cocoa Tea show flop, anywhere, be it home, or abroad. All of this combined with his appreciation of his craft, and constant striving to still develop his style makes Tea one of my favorite artists, and he never spoils, armed with some of the strongest vibes in all of the dance.Probably the most notable producer Cocoa Tea has ever worked with was Henry 'Junjo' Lawes. It was on Lawes' imprint, Volcano, where Cocoa Tea first made a name for himself and also made his first hits. He also made the 3 albums for RAS Records (Kingston Hot, Sweet Love and Rocking Dolly) from which the materials for this fine fine installment of RAS' nice series, Ras Portraits, were pulled. And while Cocoa Tea is an artist with a healthy dose of greatest hits albums on the shelves, none at all do a better joob at capturing the high quality pieces he did with the late Lawes.The power of this album pretty much rests with the 3 MASSIVE tracks he did for Lawes, however, much of the supporting material is arguably just as fine. Check the unearthly sweet Louisiana. The song may be the first example of a song which I've heard by CT when he actually applies a sort of 'lift' to his voice instead of just his natural way of singing. The slight tweak makes the song so sweet you may need a note from your dentist to get through it! Also definitely check the highly addictive (took about 3 spins to grown on me) No Wanted Me, easily one of the best tunes here for the dancefloor.I love the format of the Ras Portraits series. The very easily digstible 11 tracks and easy price make the entire series worth checking as it generally features some of the finer Jamaican singers who have recorded for the label (which is nearly every prominent roots singer of the past 20 years.Also check the on situation where CT goes completely cultural on the album on the wicked wicked Gotta Know Rastafari, a very very big track! Check Kingston Hot over Lawes' well powerful Freedom Blues, which was actually a decent hit for Cocoa Tea and the title track of his very first RAS album; and I have to mention Jah Made Them That Way over the Answer riddim on which Tea actually invokes the melody of Michael Jackson and makes it work completely.But, as I mentioned, the power here is between the three major hits Cocoa Tea and Lawes scored together. The opener, Rocking Dolly, is without a doubt one of the biggest of CT's career and was considered a rather large victory when RAS 'won' the song for its album of the same title. The you get my choice for the album's best song altogether, the wicked wicked Bust Outta Hell over Lawes' Love is Not A Gamble riddim. The song, which I've seen him do many time sin concert has always been one of my favorites from the very first second that I heard it and is STILL one of the first tunes I relate the artist with. And lastly, check I Lost My Sonia, the dancehall SMASH over Lawes' well traveled and well powerful mad mad riddim, which went a far way in establishing the name of Cocoa Tea as a force in the dancehall.Overall, just as always when dealing with the Ras Portraits albums, I'm more than happy to recommend this one. For older fans of the artist, you may have all the tunes already, however, if you don't this is as definitely as great of an album as any to get them all together. And for the newer fans looking to catch onto this sweet sweet talent, definitely a nice place to start. Cocoa Tea and Junjo Lawes had a fantastic chemistry together and its a shame that Lawes passed in 1999 and they didn't have a chance to continue their works. Still, when I grow up, I want to be just like Cocoa Tea.

There is a healthy slew of well powerful, yet virtually unknown singers here in Jamaica. These artists, all, once ruled some part of reggae music, however, even here in Jamaica have for whatever reason fallen from the well populated musical map. Some of them have moved to foreign lands, some have spent a great deal of their time touring which has kept them away from JA studios, and some even still have fallen on ill health (such is the case for Peter Broggs). Names like Peter Broggs, Earl 16, Earl Zero and Iqulah are not only lost to youths of today, but also many of todays musicians as well.In the case of fine fine roots talent Peter Broggs, who suffered a stroke in the past couple of years, his music has become so unbelievably difficult to find and his fanbase has dwindled to the few older fans who were lucky enough to have discovered his vibes during his prime from the late 1970's through the mid 1980's. Broggs' talent and most distinguishing characteristic had always been his lyrical capabilities (and even when singing songs written by others, his slight changes have always improved the song). So, although he may not have had the vocal capabilities of some of his peers such as Dennis Brown or Hugh Mundell, Broggs always found some of the strongest vibes in all of roots through excellent writing and overall diligence through perfecting his craft.This album, the Ras Portraits, is a virtual greatest hits album. The series has, over the years, been a nice series releasing greatest hits albums for soem of the greatest singers to record for Ras Records such as the aformentioned Brown, Cocoa Tea and Gregory Isaacs. However, even though his Portraits album matches up well to his peers' Peter Broggs is the sole claimant to one official title that none of them can ever have.Ras Records began in 1979 and has to date been one of the finest distributors of reggae music the genre has ever known with nearly 30 years of service to the vibes. Way back in 1982, the label released its first full blown studio album, Rastafari Liveth. The artist? Peter Broggs! Dread, who founded the label saw the immense talent in the then 28 year singer from Hanover, and nearly a quarter of a century later, it is clear he chose the perfect artist.Ras Portraits does a good solid job of capturing the artist at the heights of his powers. When I looked at the tracklist I was most happy that it contained my favorite Peter Broggs track, and the best on the album, #11, International Farmer. The sweet sweet herbalist track was recorded over a fine and heavy lush reggae one drop provided by the legendary Roots Radics band and it goes to the end in providing the listener with everything he/she needs to know about the fantastic vocalist (and I'm definitely hoping he gets better, would LOOOOOOOOOVE to see he and Marlon Asher do a track together!).Nearly every track here is a winner: Definitely check the title track from that first Ras album, Rastafari Liveth which takes care of explaining everything International Farmer didn't. Broggs was not bashful in his beliefs and it reflected in his music as everything takes a backseat in praising Jah, and he, perhaps, never did a better job in doing so in his career than on Rastafari Liveth. However, if he did, it would be on the MASSIVE Rastaman Chant Nyabinghi, one of my other favorite songs from the artist. Chant Nyabinghi is slightly more laid back than most of the rest of the material on the album, but that is the very reason why it stands out, its a very beautiful song.Of course have to mention one of his later hits, Cease the War (which would eventually become the title track of his final studio album to date for RAS, *Progressive Youths was release in '99 but recorded 2 decades earlier*) and the following track, Military Man, a song which echoes the sentiments of the previous track. And I have to mention, lastly the beautiful beautiful Cheer Up! I had never heard the song prior to listening to this album and its definitely one of his better songs overall, with a message declaring that because JAH will take care of things, just cheer up!Overall, hope the best to Peter Broggs in his recovery. I would definitely love to see this talent back recording (he last released a studio album in 2000, for Jah Warrior of the UK on Jah Golden Throne) and spreading the excellent messages and the good vibes. I definitely would see newer fans attracted to this album as it does a relatively good job in covering Broggs' career and a great deal of his tracks (also would recommend the more readily available This is Crucial Reggae compilation, also from RAS which has virtually the same tracklisting and was released just in 2005). Broggs enjoys a standing here which is not too fitting for such a fine artist, however, just by the simple trod to your favorite record store can cure that, Peter Broggs is definitely top notch.

I imagine somewhere in Martinique right now there is an artist by the name of Sal to whom, more or less, I owe credit alone for starting my supreme interest in reggae coming from France and the French West Indies. I had heard other artists before surely, but none had produced the type of interest which I ultimately took up after having enjoyed Sal's vibes to the point where suddenly, the entire subgenre began to interest me. In a couple of years I imagine that I might be saying the same thing about venerable British singer Lloyd Brown doing for me for British reggae what Sal did for me in terms of French reggae. Late last year I was fortunate enough to come across Brown's most recent album, the well solid Silver (in celebration of his 10th album), and since then I've taken such a far greater interest in the vibes coming from the UK. Previously, my only consistent experience with the music from the area came in the form of wicked singer Bitty McLean who (courtesy of VP Records' constantly and BRILLIANTLY adding him to their compilations) came to attention with vibes so sweet they harkened back to a seemingly and unfortunately forgotten era of Jamaican lover's rock reggae. While Bitty McLean definitely made a fan for life in me by virtue of those songs, for some reason or another, while I definitely made the connection between him and UK reggae, I never felt the interest to go digging a little deeper and further `discover' the names such as Lloyd Brown, Peter Hunnigale and Peter Spence, who, although familiar names to me at the time, I had yet to REALLY dig beneath the surface to learn about. What was it about Brown? Undoubtedly it was the element of cultural material he spiced into his vibes apart from the crisp and classic lover's rock vibe which is what I expected going in (since then I've learned that only certain artists do that, while Lloyd Brown and the wicked Peter Spence definitely have a STRONG cultural vibes in their music, Hunnigale and McLean tend to focus primarily on the lover's rock). The first name I began to take an interest was definitely that of Peter Spence who, by virtue of having a forthcoming album (which goes by the name of Strength and is so `strong' I fully expect it to be somewhere on my list of 2008's best reggae albums in December) which I sought out, immediately grabbed my attention with a style (of vibes, not vocally) similar to Brown's and were you to ask me my favourite current UK reggae singers, number one would be Brown and number two would be a tie between McLean and Spence definitely!Then I moved to other names. In doing research on Spence, I came to find out that he wasn't exactly the most prolific name in the business and in fact that his 2007 offering, Emotionally Charged was only the fourth official release of a career nearing 20 years old. Far more prolific and therefore more accessible was Spence's London neighbour Peter Hunnigale. In terms of popularity (apparently) the far more active Hunnigale ranks alongside Brown as arguably the two biggest names in British reggae and when you really dig into his vibes it becomes crystal clear almost immediately. Peter Hunnigale may simply be one of the most talented lover's rock singers I have EVER heard from anywhere. While my undeniable and undisputed favourite in the genre would definitely have to be the legend Beres Hammond, if some twenty-something year old fan of the music from the UK would tell me that he had the same sort of reverence for Hunnigale as I have for Hammond, I wouldn't think twice about it at all (although I imagine that perhaps even Hunnigale himself would favour the flawless Hammond in that comparison). Peter Hunnigale makes the type of music which makes you happy that you have someone to dance with (and if you don't it probably would make you want to go and find someone)! In my brief experiences with the singer I've noticed that nearly all of his tunes are dance floor accessible definitely. Hunnigale also, LUCKILY for me, was in the news as of late due to a rather odd release of his new album for 2008 by the name of Free Soul. The album has attracted SO MUCH underground interest from fans due, in part, to the fact that its strictly going out on vinyl and due also in part that it just happens to appear to be one of the strongest pieces of his career to date. While Free Soul comes to us by way of UK label Peckings (who I knew from doing the business for McLean as well), Hunnigale, like Brown, had previously been very active with the UK based JetStar (the two even shared one of the label's Toe 2 Toe albums featuring both) who, at one point in the not too distant past, was responsible for releasing the biggest and most popular names in UK reggae (and some of the worst as well, you'll do yourself well to avoid that Tug-a-War album should you ever find it anywhere) before having something which can only be described as a full on degeneration of itself in the past two years or so. Luckily, standing tall enough to pick up the slack has been Cousins Records' Donville Davis who has seemingly been determined to IMMEDIATELY build Cousins into one of the biggest reggae labels in the world. Well, if that was his goal, he has definitely achieved, with the also UK based Greensleeves selling to the biggest label, VP Records and JetStar continuing to. . . Do whatever it has been doing and staying FAR off the radar with anything of note, Cousins' ever-growing catalogue and consistent release schedule has, within a very short time, made itself one of the most consistently dependable labels in the business. And they don't forget their home base luckily as they have released multiple albums now for Brown, Spence and now Peter Hunnigale with his latest release (prior to Free Soul) the sublime Rhythm & Song which was released in 2006 and now reaches global just two years later.Rhythm & Song is an album which is very much the brainchild of Hunnigale himself as he does virtually all of the production on the album alongside Davis. It is the first of what hopefully will be several albums for the label as Cousins seems strong enough to support annual albums for their artists (in the case of Spence he has two in consecutive years as has Brown who is currently reportedly preparing his third for the label) and it is indeed a very fine way to begin. Beginning things for the album itself is the lovely Hearts Desire. In UK reggae they tend to LOVE doing cover tracks (NO, to my knowledge Sanchez is not English) in much of the classic Jamaican style with American r&b; style tunes. In the case of Hearts Desire, Hunnigale taps the longstanding Jamaican group The Mighty Diamonds. Track down a copy of the Mighty Diamonds version and then come back to Hunnigale's, with massive respect to the originators definitely, there is almost no comparison. The well polished and downright smooth vibes Hunnigale pushes eclipses the original, which is rare and a huge testament that you're listening to a dominant lover's rock singer. Next up is one of the few non-lover's tracks and one which is definitely one of Rhythm & Song's best overall, My Yesterdays. This tune is a very nice recounting of the singer's growing up in London and even eventually getting involved in the music scene. The second verse here is probably the single most memorable on the entire album as Hunnigale recounts going to Downbeat dances and just produces a wonderful vibes. The tune altogether sounds like something you would hear in a film when someone is reminiscing about old days and its wonderful! Closing the opening of Rhythm & Soul is House of Love, yet another master class of a lover's tune. The tune (like the album itself) is a piece which just makes you feel good definitely. Check the chorus here for what may just be the overall best on the album and definitely one for the lover's on the dance floor (and you could probably use it other places as well).Taking a big look at the album as a whole, the one track which sticks on (at least on paper) is definitely the combination Keep It Real with Jamaican dancehall singer Lukie D. I have to give credit where its due! Save from a time when I heard the Kingston native singing the Jamaican National Anthem (which he also recorded for one of his own albums, Deliver Me) I don't know if I've EVER heard Lukie D sounds better than he does on Keep It Real. He has a completely different vocal style from Hunnigale who employs a velvety smooth tone which melds perfectly to his brand of lover's rock; Lukie D has this big and loud voice which he honed in the dancehall but definitely uses quite well on the tune which is one of the few non-Hunnigale productions on the album - it flows nicely over established UK reggae outfit Stingray's serene More Strength on which it is the undeniable highlight and one of the album's real gems (its also available onLukie D's recently released Japanese album Here I Am). Stingray also chimes in behind the board for the excellent Your Lucky Day later in the album which on a bit of an inspirational and uplifting style of vibes (I swear Peter Hunnigale could sing a tune about a rock and it would sound like a lover's piece!) as he tells us all to `make each day your lucky day', and who could disagree with the sentiment. Check the EPIC Raindrops to Butterflies which sounds so familiar (but I can't call it a cover because I can't think of the original if there is one) to my ears. If you don't like Raindrops to Butterflies then you just don't like Peter Hunnigale's style of vibes. While I won't call it my favourite tune here (that comes later) it is the tune here which shows the singer in probably what is the most favourable light on the entire album. I'd also suggest Hot and Cold, which has a much more straight forward cultural vibes (even though I hesitate to cal it a roots track) and is very impressive. Besides the very strong opening and Keep It Real and of course just the overall vibes of the album (I have to say that somewhere in the middle of this album, if you are REALLY a hardcore reggae head, you might lose track of which era you might be sitting in, there is just some big big classic lover's vibes here) the real story for me in Rhythm & Song comes at the end of the album as it peaks with my two favourite tunes altogether here (which is saying a lot). First is Pull Up A Chair is a great big jovial style of vibes backing what is one of the big PURE cultural vibes on the album and from the early portion where I heard the big horn sound I just got a big smile and a big joy from it. While I wouldn't ever tell Hunnigale to go as far on a rootical side as Lloyd Brown does (as he was MADE to sing lover's rock), he shows with the excellently crafted Pull Up A Chair that he can definitely hold that vibes as well. The tune comes off as a straight lesson of the Afrikan Diaspora from Hunnigale as if he is teaching it to someone as a friend. Its just something very different and a very nice changeup for the album. Rhythm & Song closes with its absolute strongest track overall, the WONDERFUL My Reggae Music. The tune is about as powerful an ode to reggae music as I've heard in quite awhile. It almost has somewhat of a classic 60's or 70's r&b; vibes to it, but its done for reggae which is just something you just don't hear too much. The tune makes you feel good to be a fan of reggae and for me, personally, while there is more well crafted tunes on the album and tunes which are sung better and written better, My Reggae Music is the definitive bow on the gift of Rhythm & Song.Overall, again, I have to give thanks to Lloyd Brown for bringing me to the genre, because, without a doubt I would have missed Rhythm & Song were it not for the Silver album. UK reggae has such a powerful and positive vibes to it these days that really I would recommend all fans of reggae to give it a big ear. Peter Hunnigale is one of the TRUE masters of an art form in lover's rock which is becoming increasingly more and more scarce (fans of the genre will ABSOLUTELY eat this one up as they wait for a next album from Beres Hammond later this year) on the large scale. As this is the type of music which is very accessible to a variety of fans (especially those having a background in r&b;), I would recommend Rhythm & Song to both new and older fans alike (and if you REALLY enjoy it, you should track down the even better Free Soul). If you're looking for something more laid back, something to bring you closer to someone and something to just make you feel good, definitely check Rhythm & Song. I bet Sal already has a copy!

If you at all know who Josie Mel is prior to reading this review then there's a good chance that you either are planning to buy this album, or already have it. The reggae world all but forgot the artist who released his debut album, Freedom, not so long ago in 2003 and has been all but unseen since.That all changed in '05 when one of the most unusual hits of the year became the massive Rasta Still Deh Bout, a combination between Mel and upstart Lutan Fyah. The song was both an intellectual and commercial success and was produced by German outfit, Minor 5 Flat 7's Brotherman. The same producer responsible for nearly masterful pieces by Turbulence, Luciano and Anthony B, amongst others. Rasta Still Deh Bout literally breathed life back into Mel's underrated career and made him into a viable artist again, he was always just as wicked though.This, unsurprisingly, led to his second album, and it was undoubtedly one of the shining moments in regage in 2005. The best track si without a doubt the opening title track. Mel's smooth vocals blend wonderfully with Lutan's equally smooth (but aggressive) dj style, on a tune which outlines the story of a youth revealing himself as Rastafarian to his friends and family, major bi big tune.Fittingly, the second best of the album is the second best tune, Consecrate Yourself, really smooth big song. Also check the excellent Hail H.I.M., He Lives of course, and Run Away. Also check the only other combination on the album, the truly massive And I Pray featuring the unknown Smokie Benz.The other tunes are very good as well, which gave me the incentive to call this one a 5 star project (albeit a weak 5 star, 4.75 or so), but Josie Mel is clearly most comfortable at home on rootsier sounding backing and on more cultural lyrics. The singer truly excels in this area but he can also lift up the love song on tunes like All Over Your Face.Overall, definitely call Rasta Still Deh Bout one of the best efforts of 2005 (and I did). The album (and song) marked the type of new hit that has been taking over roots reggae recently. Not just the big name recognizable talents such as Sizzla, Capleton and Luciano, but unheard of acts such as Lutan Fyah, Gyptian, Perfect and Hero just making purely good music, and good vibes. Definitely throw Josie Mel into that bunch and watch out for this artist in the future.

The reggae compilation has been around even before international record labels have been releasing reggae artist's albums. Reggae, perhaps even moreso than most other musical forms, makes itself accessible to the compilation album because of the celebratory style of the music. Even on our radio stations here, you will hear what basically amounts to a compilation as generally a particular riddim, but sometimes a particular style or subject matter will have several full or nearly full tunes play at any given time. Reggae fans love compilations!Myself included.Thus, most of our big labels and distibutors have their big compilations and semi-big compilations which they release AT LEAST annually: VPRecords has its Reggae Gold and its Strictly the Best series; Greensleeves has its Biggest Ragga and One-Drop Anthems as well as its Ragga Ragga Ragga series, and JetStar has its Reggae Hits and Toe to Toe. Still even they all have a riddim album series and yet more labels, such as Jamdown and Trojan SURVIVE on little more than compilations alone these days.What I look for, however, in choosing a good one, besides the one's I buy annually is something different. I love seeing a company offer something different that the cookie cutter pieces which are generally promoted. Thus, I am a fan of such comps. as Culture Dem from Lustre Kings and Bambu Station's Talkin Roots series from Mt. Nebo. I am also a fan of the multiple artists with several tracks on a non-mixtape style compilation. That is what attracted me to the 4 Rebels compilation from VP, and although I'm getting around to it more than 5 years later, the 'wait' was still worth it.This album, again, goes against the grain: Not because of the type of a compilation that it is, but with who it features. You can almost fil in the blank with something like this normally, Luciano, Sizzla, Anthony B and _________. Generally the blank would be filled by Capleton, or even maybe Junior Kelly, but 4 Rebels does NICE by filling in underrated but well deserving singer, Yami Bolo. Bolo is an excellent choice on such an album, because he offers a consistency which most artists don't and just listening for a brief span of three tunes, his talents are greatly appreciated.Luciano kicks things off with his superb and best offering of the 3, Blessing. Blessing is a big track which is easily amongst the finest 4 Rebels has to offer altogether and it flows in typical Luciano style where the voice and the vibes are the stars.Anthony B takes teh mic next and he scores his biggest point on his second offering with the wonderful message of Yard & Abroad. The tune not only makes a mention of some of the terrible conditions here in Jamaica, but all over the world as an alternative as well. Very big track from one of reggae's most consistent djays.Yami Bolo steps in and scores immediately with my second favorite tune on the album as a whole. Conqueror has one of the best hooks on the album and the song is well powerful as Bolo exclaims, "No way can a vampire conquer the children of the Emperor!". Just a big powerful vibe which Bolo's fan's have been enjoying his entire career.Lastly is Sizzla Kalonji's turn on the mic and he does nothing but offer the single best tune on the album, Thou Shall Not Kill. The song, fans will know because it appeared with a different riddim on 2005's re-release of the Da Real Thing album, Da Real Live Thing (then called Be Still on a BEAUTIFUL Bobby Digital riddim). Knowing his career with lyrics always being his strongpoint, Thou Shall Not Kill is STILL one of the finest songs, lyrically, Kalonji has ever offered.Further definitely check Anthony B. with an uncredited singer on the lovely My Story! I had a hard time selecting Yard & Abroad ever so slightly over My Story, but the tune is nearly just as huge! Check the wonderful Cool It Down from Bolo which flows on the same riddim as Luciano's Blessing (and another old Xterminator track which I'm almost mad at myself for not remembering, but I THINK its a Cocoa Tea track and I'm sure as soon as I finish this review, I'll remember it). Bolo, of course more than handles the riddim well, and arguably does a better job than the Messenger with it. Check either of Luciano's other tracks. Both Moving Out of Babylon and Black Man King are exceptional (particularly. . . well particularly both of them!). And Sizzla rounds the album out with the wondefully minimalistic Have Your Own, which starts off a pure acapella track but eventually flows lovely over a very minimally produced riddim and the song works perfectly over just a heavy 'clap'.Overall, I'm definitely recommending 4 Rebels! It came back strong as well, with a Vol. 2 on RAS which is solid as well. I love the mixup here, someone was paying attention, adding Yami Bolo instead of someone who is much more expected, and Bolo does a fine job. The best, however, is done by Luciano and while Sizzla scores the bigger shots, Luciano wears down the opposition with his consistency, ever so slightly moreso than the ever-wicked Anthony B. This one flows in a line of nice comps. such as JetStar's 5 Disciples, and the unearthly wicked underground piece, Saddle to the East. If you enjoyed that type of vibes, then take no exception to adding 4 Rebels to your collection.

Just about 2 and a half years ago Tanya Stephens returned from her self-imposed musical 'exile' to Sweden to drop the finest album of her career, Gangsta Blues. GB caught many people by surprise and set Stephens in rare air as a complete female dancehall artist, who had yet to crossover, but could still sell albums. For a dancehall album, on an indie label (VP), Gangsta Blues did amazing, reportedly selling over 100,000 copies.The now eagerly awaited Rebelution has caught no one by surprise, and it more than lives up to the sickly high standards set by GB. Rebelution is very similar to Gangsta Blues in terms of the vibe, with the only main difference being that Rebelution takes a more cultural vibe in its duration, however, musically the two are very similar. Stephens and her manager/producer, the brilliant Andrew Henton work the boards and the minimalist production here makes Stephens' greatest talent, the real star of the album.Tanya Stephens has a very different style for reggae. She is somewhat in the same veign of Lieutenant Stitchie or Papa San (minus the fast chat) in that she is a pure story teller. All of her songs are about SOMETHING, there is a message to be found in each one of her verses and while she isn't as active as some of her peers, her fans would seemingly have no problem in waiting longer for her to craft such gems of music.The best song on Rebelution is probably the wicked wicked first US single, These Streets. These Streets an admonishment to her lover who spends much time which rides a slightly revamped version of Marley's No Woman, No Cry riddim. Instead of going out again, she suggests he "keep your lips pon me like your marijuana". The song is lyrically BRILLIANT and its not the only one here. You also check the wicked Do You Still Care a tune about acceptance and discrimination (and I would suggest those of you who are going to flock to Beenie Man or Vybz Kartel's latest cd to talk about homophobia to flock to this one to talk about Anti-homophobia), the way that song is put together: From a white racist dying of liver failure being saved by the liver of a Black man to a homophobic ghetto youth being saved by a gay passerby after being shot.(See how easy it is to review a 20 track cd when all of the songs are about SOMETHING).Also check Come A Long Way, an ode to Black leaders of the past. Come a Long Way is one of the main tune which emphasizes the differences between between Rebelution and Gangsta Blues. Also check the opener, Welcome to the Rebelution, a spoken word style piece which NO ONE in dancehall could have written besides Tanya Stephens and it sets the album off on the right foot.Then you get to the other side of Stephens. Both Put it On You and Don't Play are 2 of the smartest sexual tunes you will ever hear. And she is a lady, so she doesn't just come out and say things (usually!) but she uses metaphors such as in Put it On You when she says, "Mi dun book a room ova di Hilton, like Paris mi nah get embarrassed so yu free fi bring di still cam!". Don't Play is my 2nd favourite tune on the album as it follows much the same vibe as the excellent Boom Wuk from the Gangsta Blues album. Also check the wicked Who Is Tanya, which is also quite similar to Wi a Lead from GB.VP has spared no expense in producing Rebelution. The wonderful packaged disc comes inside a holder which is wrapped and then the case underneath is still wrapped like a typical cd. Also, in the package is a (now becomming more and more common in reggae) dvd. The DVD includes videos from the big hit from Gangsta Blues, Its a Pity and the first JA single Warm Dem. It also includes a private performance Tanya held in NYC for several of the tracks from the album; However, most interestingly, it includes interviews in the studio with Tanya and others. Perhaps the most interesting being when her own producer, Andrew Henton and the producer who discovered her Barry O'Hare discuss her lyrical ability, with Henton summing it up best as "we figured if you make music with no point, then whats the point of making the music?"Overall, this is one of the best releases of the year, nearly all of the 20 tracks (including the interludes, Sunday Morning is MASSIVE, and Saturday Morning aint that bad either!)are winners, even the ones I didn't mention, Cherry Brandy (combined with Saturday morning) a story about (trying to) overcoming alcohol; The Truth, talking about how hard it is to get over an old lover; Home Alone, squite similar to These Streets in the same vibe, but lyrically maybe even stronger. They're all top notch, the album is top notch.AMAZING! GO GET IT!

With the possible exception of a little album due to be released in about 2 weeks, you probably won't find a much more hyped reggae album in 2005 than Welcome to Jamrock. It's been a rather long 4 years since the release of Bob's youngest child, Damian's last album, the excellent Halfway Tree, and 'Jamrock' promises to be even more successful than its Grammy winning predecessor.The hype comes in the very unlikely form of the title track which draws its power from an old Junior Reid tune and an even older Ini Kamoze track (somewhere right now Ini is singing "Out in the streets they call it murderrrrrrrr" and the crowd is thinking he got it from Jr Gong), the song has become a reggae superhit and has even some of the harshest critic calling it one of reggae's finest moment's since the elder Marley was on the scene nearly a quarter century ago.Damian's talents lie, first and foremost, in his production. Quiet as kept, his older brother Stephen has become a true reggae production master over the years, the highlight being the work he did on Halfway Tree, and Jamrock isn't a whole lot behind. Damian also has one of the single best flows in reggae and could seemingly lock down an entire track for about an hour if he ever saw fit.While the title track is destined to receive the most attention here, the rock solid best tune is the closer, Khaki Suit featuring dancehall legends Bounty Killer and Eek-a-Mouse. The song is as polished of an old school gem as you'll hear anywhere and the death grip that Jr Gong lays into the riddim (at one point it appears as if though Bounty is almost fighting for his chance) is highly impressive mixed with Mouse's background its totally the best record. Of course check the hard hitting title track; as well as the apocolyptic opener Confrontation which features both Bunny Wailer and actual voicings of Marcus Mosiah and His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I.You also have to check the fun ska flavored All Night, both of the prerequisite homages to Nesta, the best of which being the awesome Move! (Jr.'s take on Exodus). The second international single Hey Girl, We're Going to Make it which is one of the rare roots moments on the album and of course The Master Has Come Back which is HIGHLY enjoyable.Overall, the album is not as good as Halfway Tree, I can't go that far, what I can say is that if you've been sitting around having the title track drummed into your head, you won't be disappointed when you pick up the finished product. Welcome to Jamrock is a big big album and hopefully it becomes a landmark style album which leads more and more fans into what is real reggae music.

Either its been a relatively short 357 days since the last `Athems' album was released or I just haven't been paying good attention. It seems like almost last week that I was sitting down writing the review for that album which seemed like it had literally been produced by Vybz Kartel, as he had appeared on about a quarter of the 40 tracks.What a difference a year makes?!Just a week shy of a year later and Kartel appears on just 3 tracks, with even one of those being a combination with recent Greensleeves signee Mavado. Things have definitely changed in the order for Greensleeves as well, as their roots output goes higher and higher, their once so annoyingly superfluous stream of riddim albums has slowed and Vybz Kartel has even threatened to leave (and get a new name). They have added Busy Signal who just released his quality debut, Step Out and reportedly Mavado whose debut is set for sometime early next year (which, in Greensleeves' dancehall terms, means next summer). Ward 21 fled the camp for some obscure Japanese label to release their latest album King of the World, you can expect Macka Diamond's next record probably in 2008-'09 if at all, and NOBODY knows what happened with Kid Kurrupt and Predator.But the Dancehall Anthem album is the jewel in Greensleeves crown. 40 tracks strong over 2 discs, every year, always something new, always interesting, and this year is no different. One of the more interesting aspects of the 2006 edition is the presence of 3 artists. Burro Banton, Ninjaman and King Yellowman are not typically the type of artists you would find anywhere near this album. But all score decent: Burro with his Man Guinep over the Intercom Reloaded riddim, Ninjaman with his `y'all forgot me' style Back in Town, "Them think I gone away, but I'm back to claim it. Nuff a them a hype but them cant maintain it!", over the Foundation riddim from Vendetta and of course King Yellow with his massive Orphan shot on the 85.Without a doubt the star of the project, however, is young singjay Mavado. His mega hit Real McCoy over the Anger Management riddim might just be the best that either of the 2 discs have to offer. Also check his nice combinations with Kartel and Busy Signal, Sunrise and Full Clip, respectively, also his Weh Dem a Do over the Red Bull & Guiness.Highlights include from disc one: Definitely Ms Angellic Alaine! With her Whine over Vendetta's Sweat riddim; A nice nice combination between Lady Spice and Pinchers over Dave Kelly's Stage Show riddim; Sizzla's infamous Nah Rape over the Inspector riddim and a DJ whom I had long left for mediocrity, Mr Peppa with his LETHAL Talk over Ward's I-Rob 21. I'll even give Hollow Point an up for his Easy Skanking over the Chinkuzi.Disc one is CONSIDERABLY better than disc 2.Save for about 5-6 tracks (2-3 of which have more than made the rounds on the compilation circuit, especially Beenie's Come Again and Busy's Step Out) the second disc is very weak. Check tracks 9-10 for the main highlight. Beenie Man and Bounty Killa continue their decade+ long war with the outstanding Bullet Proof Vest from Beenie and not to be outdone Bounty's Bullet Proof Skin. Beenie scores the bigger shot as Bounty turns to recycled lyrics, but both are still well done over the hard hard (Bellyas-esque) Show Off riddim.Also check Sizzla's nice Purple off the Battlefield riddim. And 2 extras from disc one, Bounty and Angel Doolas, also over the Battlefield on Not Me (a decade after Merciless used the same title for a Bounty counteraction) and Kartel on the infectious Beyonce Wine.The bad? I don't like the soundmen/dancers making tunes. And they are in healthy abundance here. Between Matterhorn's 4 tracks (including the well well traveled Dutty Whine), Ding Dong's equally prolific Bad Man Forward, Bad Man Pull Up and the steadily annoying Soltex 3000, makes a nice corner of this album barely listenable. Also Supahype's HORRID take on Baby Cham's Ghetto Story on Uptown Story and Bunji's Brrrt which is actually good (provided you don't listen to it more than a couple of times).Overall, through my rants, I don't know how I couldn't recommend this one. Between the 40 tracks, there is bound to be a steady stream of about 14-15 which you will like. That's an entire album worth of songs at no extra charge. This edition, perhaps more than any other has made sure to try and stay current with Jamaica, many of these songs are still weeks and weeks away from being off of the radio here. So you get up to date with some vibes, meet some new artists (including David House, Capleton prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Munga whom I didn't mention) and you're guaranteed to find something you like here if you like dancehall at all.

I'm almost amazed that it took one of the bigger reggae labels all this time to check out Jah Mason. To date, his previous 7 albums have been released on a ton of different labels, with the highest profile arguably being Steve Mosco's Jah Warrior, but seemingly Jet Star, Greensleeves and VP had all turned the deaf ear to one of the wickedest roots lyricists to emerge from JA in awhile.That all ended when teh boomshot known as Princess Gone jumped on the scene in 2005 and absolutely locked down JA. The song showed Mason as a vulnerable, wounded hearted warrior (so much so that the cover of the album shows him walking along the train tracks looking completely dejected). The album itself follows the same vibe, this is Jah Mason, in love/before love/after love/meditating love, so 8 albums deep and he reveals the sensitive side?Its still a good album, although not Mason at his best (would absolutely love to see VP bring him back next year in his normal stylee), Princess Gone is a very very smooth one drop reggae album. The best tune here is probably Stay in My Heart, absolutely love the bubbling on that tune. Also have to check the 2 title tracks of course, always wondered exactly what the whole Saga Bed thing was about with Mason, the song is fantastic!Also, check Real Lioness, Stick Nor Stone (big big tune), Plan Out, the beautiful So Good which is more along the lines of what Mason tyically does, and is one of his better older tunes. And check waiting for, which has just grown on me while writing this review.Overall, definitely I reccommend anything Mason touches, he'll never release an album that isn't worthy of a listen. This album should do very well for the artist and wake up the fair-weathered reggae fan to his style of music and not limit him to the "he sounds like Capleton" role.

On Mentally Disturbed Ward 21 has easily managed to put together one of the hardest hitting, rawest dancehall albums ever. While putting together such an album, they've also managed to create on of the best dancehall albums in a long time as well. The entire album with the exception of the very slack interlude is awesome. My favorite cuts are Pain 21st Century, The Illness, Don't Push It, Eyes Wide Shut, Da Pum (Brain Damage), defintely Grimey, and I could go on and on and on. However, my absolute favorite track is President of Hoochie Land, and another cut called Ma Doggs is growing on me, and if you're an Elephant Man fan, he's also here on Anything-A-Anything. Overall, I'm in love with this album, if you like hip hop you'll probably like this album, it has that total feel on it, and certainly if love dancehall music, then this album is a must have, it ranks above the excellent T.O.K. as far as a group record is concerned. Go get it.WARNING: BAD MAN LYRICS PON THESE TUNES

In continuing with what has to be one of the most unlikely of runs to reggae royalty of recent memory (and probably in all of modern reggae), former run of the mill average badman dj turned wicked roots sensation, Chuck Fenda brings forward one of the single most anticipated reggae releases of 2007, The Living Fire. The album, Fenda's sophomore effort after his 2004 outstanding debut Better Days, comes armed with one of (if not his biggest) Fenda's biggest hits to date, the awesome and controversial Gash Dem (and Light Dem). The song proved to be a monumental hit in the hardworking artist's career and Fenda used it to his advantage to push forward his next project, The Living Fire (as well as his label of the same name). He also used it to create the type of hype he was looking for surrounding him. After a 2005-06 which saw Fenda's names more in the newspapers and tabloids than on the local charts, Fenda's Gash Dem showed exactly what the artist could do when properly prepared mentally as he took aim on one of the most lethal social commentaries in all of reggae music since late 1996 when Anthony B dropped the now infamous Fire Pon Rome. Fender had rather controversially been dismissed (or dismissed himself, depending on who you ask) from the up and coming 5th Element label which included (then) singer Anthony Cruz and (still) singer and roots sensation Richie Spice. Now heading out solo, we get to see exactly what Fenda learned at 5th Element as he takes control on The Living Fire.The New York born Chuck Fendah had previously garnered attention through his earlier work, during which he was labeled by many (myself firmly included) as a Bounty Killer clone. He, like many before him, during his time and since was the type of artist who had yet to show any ability whatsoever to distinguish himself, and had scored virtually no hits of substance, although near the end of his career as a hardcore dancehall artist he did find himself as one of the legendary King Jammy's house do's. His conversion (both literal and figurative) came in early 2000 when he sighted up Rastafari and like so many artists before him (namely Capleton and Buju Banton) his career almost immediately took a turn for the better. Shortly thereafter, Fenda would link with Devon Wheatley, founder of 5th Element Records which would even take him to the next step. Almost immediately Fenda was identified with the likes of Richie Spice and Anthony Cruz, with Spice, however, the duo would shine as both begin to build wicked wicked catalogues for 5th Element. Before leaving his flagship label Fenda would not only FINALLY release his debut album (something he had failed to do, despite trying a great deal) he would attain such great heights, scoring hits with tunes like Ruff Out Deh, No More Suffering, the wicked wicked The Prayer, Mama and most notably, I Swear over 5tH Element's dominant I Swear riddim. The conversion would take Fenda so far in such a short period of time that, despite his long time spent in the studios of NYC and Jamaica, his success (along with Spice's) was almost seen as an overnight sensation.Fenda's unceremonious withdrawal (or removal depending on whom you ask) from the Element put an uncertain air around his career, and he has yet, even today to really comment on the circumstances of his departure from 5th Element (with local speculation saying from something as high tech and unusual as government involvement, to something as simple as a woman being between Fenda and his former camp). Nevertheless, his first album, Better Days, originally release by 5th Element, became a reggae underground classic and was released with Spice's Spice in Your Life (which held a similar status until re-released by VP Records in 2006). The album was armed with the biggest tracks of Fenda's entire career to date and set a well tall standard for all of its follow-ups to live up to. Better Days is one of the better modern roots albums you'll actually hear (particularly from a straight DJ). Through all of that, when he has managed to successfully plan his way to the studio to do a solid recording since leaving the Element, Fenda has continued to strive. Besides Gash Dem, Fenda has continued to score with healthy hits, and his name has continued to be one of the preferred for top island promoters as he still regularly is amongst the artists topping the bill at some of the biggest reggae stage shows throughout the Caribbean.Thus, despite a releasing roster for the year which includes such names as Lady Saw, Bounty Killer, Stephen Marley and Capleton, Chuck Fenda's Living Fire is definitely without a doubt one of the most anticipated albums of 2007 by reggae heads. Besides being the album for Gash Dem (which was its original title, before Eternal Flame and finally Living Fire, Fenda's new signature call as well as the name for his label), Living Fire the album comes full of hard roots vibes. And although lean on the big I Swear-like anthemic type of tracks, it more than makes up for the lacking, based on the unique turns and twists the album makes without ever straying too far from the goals and teachings of HIM and the `poor people's defender', Fenda. The resurgent Greensleeves (which was sold last year to another owner which may explain its recent turn for the better) stepped up to do the distribution honors and they have a winner on their hands!The best tune here is certainly Gash Dem. Poignantly riding Juke Box' hit Confessions riddim, Gash Dem is one of the hardest and harshest calls to judgment you'll ever hear (and that's saying a lot in reggae music!). One of the most controversial tunes in recent memory, the revenge laden but beautiful Gash Dem was banned on local radio stations and likewise in several other ports in the Caribbean. It did not stop the tune, however, from reaching the masses and being ultra in demand throughout 2006. The rather controversial video didn't help the case as well (well, maybe it did) as it was just as saturated in a similar vibes (the video is included here as well). Gash Dem's rather scathing follow up, the inferno that is Fenda's Freedom of Speech , is Fenda's personal recounting of how he felt and dealt with the controversy surrounding Gash Dem and as well as his fan's reactions. It actually is a much more interesting song lyrically just from what he says than from an actual vibes, but still BIG nevertheless and a tune definitely requiring several spins for the masses as it reached highly on the charts on its own might.Apart from the two well known tracks (well there is one more well known track), The Living Fire gets very very interesting. Check, for example, Put it On Me, which is about. . . Exactly what you expect it to be about, but it flows sooooo nicely over one of the strongest one drops on Living Fire backed by a downright divine Dean Fraser saxophone playing throughout (so much instrumental (no pun intended) is Fraser in the tune that he receives a writing credit) on one of the most unlikely of combinations. Speaking of unlikely combinations, just give a listen to the odd almost electric acoustic vibe that is Child of the Universe which features of all people, dancehall poet the wicked Tanya Stephens alongside Fenda. The song is somewhat slow and again falls under the category of `listen to the words, don't try and feel the vibes'. Tanya is her usual brilliant self and Fenda does his best to hold his own, but I never quite got over the surprise of actually having the two on the same track! Another combination, and the real big deal of them all probably is Working For with Richie Spice. The former stablemates, having teamed up several times before (most notably for me, on the wicked wicked Fake Smile) Working For is much more of the same top notch material fans are used to coming from the duo. Spice's brand of critical mass singing at one time and bedside crooning on the other almost mirrors Fenda's laid back chanting and exploding DJ style and the two strike gold yet again with Working For.Although Gash Dem is the best and biggest tune on the album, DO NOT overlook the absolute gem that is I'm Praying. Flowing over Gadaffi's relicking of Marley's Redemption Song riddim (now called the Old Pirates riddim), I'm Praying makes the best usage of the riddim that I've heard (with respect to Fantan Mojah & Merciless' combination High Grade), and is easily amongst the Living Fire's finest offerings altogether. It almost reminds me (not in sound, but in vibe) of the similarly title The Prayer from the Better Days album.A couple of more standouts are wicked wicked Long Road! Long Road is a heavy heavy piece and probably with the exception of Gash Dem is the most lyrically most profound of all the tunes on Living Fire. In the same respect and not too far from the top of the heap of the album is the beautiful Nah Laugh. Nah Laugh is a track built strictly for the reggae heads. Sounding like something built directly in Tuff Gong, the song, with the heavy horn backing shows almost everything that is great about Fenda as an artist! The song shows him in his finest form.Overall, I have to recommend The Living Fire by Chuck Fenda. What is missing here is a real dancehall piece which Fenda is capable of, and at times it may come off as slightly mechanical. but its definitely worth the price of admission. The album perhaps marks a change in Fenda's career as he is maybe becoming more and more lyrical and straying away from the hype which surrounded him during his tenure at 5th Element. All for the better perhaps, as with each and every passing album, Fenda is proving his pen amongst the sharpest and his bag of lyrics amongst the deepest in all of reggae. Definitely check it out.

So its not that I have a particular problem with crossover dancehall albums, its just that. . . well, they generally end up being way more crossover than dancehall. The bottomline is that the same problems that exist in crossing dancehall over to a bigger (i.e. US) audience will always exist. The language will never be understood, the artists will never be as identifiable, their skill never as appreciated (in the US) as in Jamaica.That being said, with Sean Paul, Elephant Man, and Wayne Wonder taking a greater place in the US music scene since the Doctor's last effort, its only right and proper that the real big man come back to reclaim what's rightfully his. Back to Basics is pretty straight forward, jumbled sounding dancehall album, and despite what's been going on lately (both in US and in Jamaica) there isn't a living artist who does those better than Beenie Man. The best tune here is arguably the 'first' single Dude (actually the second single from Def Jamaica), also love the real first single King of the Dancehall, really pretty much typical Beenie Man fare on that one, very familiar sounding. Also, old school real dancehall heads take a listen to the basic chorus on the curiously titled Grindacologist, strictly from an old Yellowman tune (Soldier Takeover). Love Get on Bad (no relation to the soca kaiso tune of the same name), Doctor Mi Rate Yu with protege Ms Thing, D-O or G-O, with odd machine computer sounding vocalist Ghost. The only 'crossover' attempt is the Timbaland produced All Girls Party which ends up amounted to the noted hip-hop producer's best attempt at making a riddim. The album ends on a very high note with Back Against the Wall, backed by a acoustic guitar riddim on which Beenie strictly tells a story, very cool, very meaningful way to end a great project.Overall, this is leaps and bounds over Tropical Storm, while that album had its spots (mainly centering around Miss L.A.P. and Bossman). Its the greatest dancehall artist ever digging in his bag of tricks and pulling out a show stopper. Its the Trendsetter album new and improved; and in a summer where there are so many huge reggae projects out and about (i.e. Baby Cham and Assassin's big label debuts, Da Real Followup album and of course the return of the Empress) Back to Basics is everything it should've been and slightly more.WARNING: BADMAN LYRICS PON DESE TUNES

Turbulence is going the way of his mentor Sizzla this year in releasing 5 albums (who himself already has 2 with at least more on the way). So early in his career, on the same label as Kalonji, Xterminator, I am waiting for him to hit that level of Black Woman & Child. I think its within his means and albums like Different Thing and The Future go to show that possibly in the near future he will reach that level. The best tune on this album (from the Lustre Kings via Jet Star) is We Need Liberation with Music is Life a close second. This album, like all of his albums to date are void of bad tunes, all have a distinct level of quality which Turbulence seems either incapable or unwilling to dip below, luckily for the listener. Also check Life Over Death, R&B tinged Nah Bluff and Selassie's the Way. Overall, may this be considered the ground level of Turbulence's ultimate development, get on now, cause undoubtedly when it reaches the top, there'll be no room at all.

I didn't know if I should give this one a 1 or a 5, I still don't know. This cd is so funny. Check out the agument on Baby's Momma, and A Woman Would Rather be Licked. This album is seriously dirty it needs two advisory labels. Get it and laugh non stop for about a year.

I am really glad that VP decided to re-release this hard to find classic, until now, everytime I wanted to hear it, I had to borrow it from someone. (Now if someone could only get Praise Ye Jah re-released) Most people regard Black Woman &amp; Child as Sizzla's absolute best album, and it is without a doubt at least top three. There are no average songs here, all sure smashes and all lyrically nearly perfect. The best of course being the title track. But some of the most lesser known tracks like &quot;No Time to Gaze&quot; and another called &quot;More Guidance&quot;, and another called &quot;Hard Ground&quot;, of course One Away as well. Another cut called Babylon a Use Dem Brain is excellent as well, and if features Capleton although he isn't given a feature credit, but he is given a writing credit. Overall, if you're a fan of Kalonji and you haven't ever had the opportunity to pick this one up, then by all means grab this one, you have absolutely no reason not to. Amazing!

Meet Lukie D. One of several somewhat overlooked and forgotten singers who fit into a pack of not outstanding, but not bad singers (I didn't want to sum him up completely as MEDIOCRE) in dancehall. He, along with singers such as Tony Curtis, Nitty Kutchie (who interestingly enough released an album named Jah Deliver Me just last year) and Singing Melody have for years made up that pack. They are all very very good singers, have had hits of varying sizes and record consistently but seem to lack the extra. . . something which sets peers of theres such as Wayne Wonder and Sanchez apart from that pack.Lukie D would be much more successful as an American r&b; singer. His style of vocal's is much more gospel and less roots oriented sounding, which is the type of big vocals which are more popular there. But, playing with the card dealt him, he has released Deliver Me, his 6th (with #5, Shelter Me, being released just 2 weeks before) and definitely most interesting set to date. Lukie's been very busy, releasing 4 albums in the last 2 years.What's most interesting about this set, Deliver Me, is that it was recorded for Frenchie at Maximum Sounds in the UK. The young producer is working on establishing a big name for himself, and first he releases an Anthony B album, loads a Jah Mason album, does a big riddim and releases a Lukie D album. The Lukie D album doesn't seem to fit in there too well, however, as somewhat lukewarm fan of Lukie D, Deliver Me is easily his most accessible and complete long player to date.Lukie, not surprisingly because of the label, comes armed with 3 big combinations on Deliver Me. The best of which being the best tune on the album, Back a Me Yard, the nice nice nice repatriation vibe with Junior Kelly. Why Junior Kelly? I have no idea but with Kelly playing the dj role completely, blending with Lukie D's toned down vocals, Back a Me Yard is a great great and emotional song.The other combinations also comprise some of the best material here. Be Wise with Anthony B is a big tune might even have a bigger vibe to it than Back a Me Yard and is definitely more bouncy and the first 2 artists to release for Maximum Sound do a very very fine combination on the tune. The 3rd is a with the Warlord Bounty Killer, Kill Another Sound. Again, very very big vibe and I love those type of songs, paricularly in combination form, very effective tune.Also check the gospel sound of the title track, which somewhat shows Lukie D at his best and worse, it doesn't really distinguish itself on the album, particularly with it being the title track, but its still a very nice song. Also love Hear Me Out over the Dis Ya Time riddim, big song; and Stand Firm, Lukie's effort of the World Jam (also known as the Jamrock) riddim redone for Frenchie.And lastly, check the opening track. Which is simply the professional singer singing a well done version of the Jamaican National Anthem, and of course is one of the best songs on the entire album.Overall, I don't know if I can blindly recommend this one to just about anyone. However, be you a fan caught up in the Wayne Wonder vibe you should give this one try, or if you have heard a song from the artist and are looking for an album. Definitely pick up Deliver Me in either situation, Deliver Me is without a doubt the biggest album of Lukie D's career.

Following a rather rocky 2006 and early 2007 on the album circuit, reggae prodigy Turbulence returns just 2 and a half months after his `07 debut, the very average Do Good, with what is probably his strongest effort in about four years, the aptly titled Stronger Than Before. Turbulence's albums for 2006 seemed to just overall lack strength and flare; The first album, No Sell Out (aka Born For This) was easily the best of the year and is still probably on the outside (albeit very close), looking in at Turbulence's 5 best album of his career; His second release, Notorious: The Album was probably his most anticipated to date and came and went as a virtual blip on the screen doing virtually no damage and actually appeared quite rushed on the part of the label, VP; Turbulence's last offering of the year, the ambitious X-Girlfriend for TAD's showed great promise in its 18 tracks but in retrospect didn't live up to the expectations, not only of it as an album (following Anthony B's very solid Suffering Man for the same label, and in retrospect it proceeded the North American release of Perfect's debut album, Giddimani on the label as well, which was even better) or the expectations which Turbulence now carries as one of the most talented and respected young reggae talents going today. They all lacked the strength of earlier album highlights such as Rising, Hail to the King, The Future and my personal favourite from the artist, the MASSIVE Join Us. Stronger Than Before, however comes armed with the proper `pedigree' to return fans to the vibes of those earlier albums from the artist who through his hard hard work over the years has become one of the most in demand (and most watched) talents in Jamaica.Stronger Than Before comes to the masses courtesy of the two companies of the moment. Handling the distribution for the album is the Cousins label who is currently pushing some of the finest roots material available anywhere these days. Besides Stronger Than Before, this year alone, Cousins has released an early candidate for album of the year, Lutan Fyah's You Bring Blessings and on this very same day which Stronger Than Before comes forward, also pushing forth is Luciano's latest release, the masterful God is Greater Than Man, so definitely Cousin is doing very very big thing in reggae music. The production on the album is almost a given. To anyone having been consistently picking up reggae releases, the riddims here (and actually Byron Murray's overall style of production) should be very very familiar. Following producing releases in the last year alone for artists such as Norris Man, Jah Mason and the aforementioned Luciano and Lutan Fyah, Byron Murray's In The Streetz continues to push top notch vibes for the music and have finally dropped the release for Turbulence (just looking at their song lineup, by virtue of how many tracks have been recorded by a particular artist, you can probably expect a Sizzla album as well any day now). It has been my experience that Turbulence will generally excel on the type of riddims and vibes which allow him to explore his entire style; that is, give him the foundation to sing, chant, rap, do and just generally adlib as well, which is what he `grew up' on voicing for Fattis at Xterminator. While Stronger Than Before focuses more on the roots, Murray's ever expanding vault of vibes also gives Turbulence a nice setting to create a very powerful album.Which is exactly what he did. Although, as I mentioned, the album moves at a slower pace on a whole, Turbulence finds a way to extract every style in which he is well versed and does a fine job. He also goes back and seems to recapture his underrated lyrical ability. After a 2006 which seemed as if the best thing for the overworked 27 year old Kingston native would be a vacation, and the first shot of 2007 being an increasingly frustrating work of mediocrity in Do Good (largely due to his producer on that album milking old deceased vibes), Stronger Than Before is a wonderfully welcome addition to Turbulence's ever expanding catalogue (by my count it becomes his 17th studio album, combine that with the fact that outside of Sizzla, Kartel and probably Jah Cure there is no artist in JA more active on the mix-tape circuit) and thankfully he's back to writing good lyrics, not just the virtual cookie cutter `Praise Jah' `Fyah Bun!' `Baby I Love You/Come back to me' style vibes which he got through the majority of `06 with pushing on albums. Need a bit of proof? Check the rather clever build of the title track over Murray's divine old school styled Desperate Lover riddim. Stronger, the song, begins as a nice ode to the pillaring artists of yesteryear and the music and changes to a song for the youths and is a praise tune all at the same time, its actually one of the better built and arranged tracks I've ever heard from the artist and would definitely love to hear him expound on it in the future (it actually reminds me of the wonderful Based on a True Story from the Join Us album). Definitely one to be checked.As an album, Stronger Than Before, is exactly that, stronger than the few albums which came before it. The album hits is high water mark in the middle beginning with track 4, the album's best piece Play Hard Ball. Play Hard Ball almost shows everything which is solid about the artist. It flows nicely over the Number Tree riddim which is a big and lush guitar heavy roots riddim which doesn't exactly drive itself as a hard and forceful vibes, but Turbulence has that ability to push it and make it become exactly that and it was the tune on the album that made me come back to it several times before moving on. The tune isn't exactly bridging a new lyrical gap for the artist, as it is that `Babylon soon fall' type of tune, but again, the way it is presented and arranged makes it a winner (and the occasional yet lovely female backing doesn't hurt at all either). Check immediately after Play Hard Ball for a track which pushes the vibes in a different direction, the excellent love track, Reconsider over Murray's unnamed riddim which I always find myself trying to find the name of. . ., but its excellent, and again, nothing different than what you're used to from the artist (in this case, `baby come back to me') but Reconsider is more introspective as he almost appears to be upset with himself and lamenting the mistake he made, just a slight lyrical twitch making the track a winner and I would LOVE to see a live performance of the track with my Empress on my arm. And when I saw the title of the following track, Love Can Make, my eyes got wide as I envisioned a remake of early Turbulence hit, Love Can Make a Difference, this song is different (and not as strong) but still very solid.Besides the middle jump up of vibes on Stronger Than Before check the one and only (yet obligatory) combination on the album, Prayer is Power with his group of friends and young artists Higher Trod. I'm always interested in hearing the group get a chance over the vibes (largely due to the fact that the Join Us album was pretty much a complete combination between Turbulence and Higher Trod) and Prayer is Power doesn't disappoint at all. Turbulence takes but one verse (and sings the hook) and gives others the chance to shine and shine they do and I'm probably most impressed by Prince Javed, seemingly the most active member of the Higher Trod Family not named Turbulence who comes off as a more impassioned version of Turbulence's uncle, Norrisman, at times (and even kind of looks like him!), but Javed doesn't disappoint leading the charge on Prayer is Power, the best JAH praising track on Stronger Than Before and one of the album's finest efforts overall (now if I can get like a Javed album or something, that would be nice. . .).Stronger Than Before does an excellent and unexpected thing at the end. The final three tracks are all relatively strong dancehall tracks, a very welcome addition to one of Turbulence's slower albums (it actually probably most reminds me of a very very strong version of the Songs of Solomon album). The first of the three is probably the track that is most I'm most familiar with, I've Been Around, one of the strongest tracks over Murray's hit Bounce riddim. The second dancehall track (and the strongest) Di Ting (and the slackest yes dat `ting') over Murray's re-lick of the exceptional Mudd Up riddim shows Turbulence can do that kind of hardcore dancehall when needed and that riddim. . . If you only buy a few riddim albums, make sure you pick up the Return of the Mudd Up, love that riddim. Lastly is the solid I'm Not Afraid over the crazy hit Hot Wuk riddim. I'm Not Afraid is nearly as good as Di Ting and it even further shows Turbulence's ability as, lyrically, it's a pure roots track do style like a dancehall track over a dancehall riddim, very nice effort. My only regret at the end is that they didn't throw in the older, yet exceptional Hype in Jah over Murray's forgotten Forensic riddim, yeah it's a few years old now, and I imagine at the time, the strictly dancehall outfit never imagined putting out an album from the young Bobo, but I still looooooooove Hype in Jah.Overall, definitely one of the `strongest' albums of Turbulence's career to date. I love the mix of vibes and Murray doesn't hit the same pitfall that Brotherman (producer of the Do Good album) hit. His vibes from the past year or two still have the fresh appeal to them (now if it's the beginning of 2008 and he's pushing a Capleton or Anthony B album with the same vibes then we might have a problem) and hearing Turbulence voice them doesn't detract from the fact that they are still very solid vibes. Stronger Than Before maybe a watershed moment for Turbulence, besides pushing mediocrity over the last year, he spent a lot of time in the tabloids due to a high profile separation with ex-girlfriend, DJ Sasha (and then a high profile exchange of lyrical jabs, and then a high profile lyrical reconciliation). However, should he return to pushing high quality music and push out the next big hit, it is likely that most fans and critics alike will quickly forget all of that and rediscover the artist. Because even though Stronger Than Before is a very very strong album, it doesn't even begin to show the true promise of one of the most untapped talents Jamaica has seen in a very long time.

Does not the entire reggae world instantaneously become a much better place the second Luciano brings forth a new album? Despite not being spectacular or as controversial as some of his slightly more popular peers, Luciano's place in roots music from the second he began voicing has always been to be the backbone, or the conscience of the music, and it is a role he has more than respectively filled for over a decade strong. While other roots artists may tent to stray slightly from the message of Rastafari, Luciano has always made it a point of his music to never even approach doing such material. The result has been the career of an artists who has undoubtedly been reggae music's dominant roots singer (and perhaps, dominant singer overall) and one of the artists whose music has legitimately and directly had an impact on the world. My own personal interest in the artist came when I discovered his music and just the near flawless manner in which he can deliver a message, be it inspirational, a love song or even a warning or condemnation and almost immediately uplift your nerves. Luciano's music makes you feel good! Simple and flat! He has, like several of his peers been very active on the album circuit throughout his career. Besides dropping well known smashes of albums like Sweep Over My Soul and Where There is Life, Luciano has also maintained his consistency with very very solid albums such as Serious Times, One Way Ticket and the recent Child of a King. Nearly all of his albums have gone to help establish his international reputation as one of the most in demand performers and vocalists for reggae, making him one of the music's (and the country of Jamaica's for that matter) greatest ambassadors.Having had a very fine and prolific recording career as he had, Luciano has released albums for virtually any reggae record company which is worth mentioning as well as recording for virtually all of the finest roots reggae producers of the past 2 decades, such as Bobby Digital, Black Scorpio, most notably Xterminator, with whom he got his start, and most recently Byron Murray at In the Streetz productions. The veteran has done it all! Also, he has inspired many youths to take to the music as nearly every baritone voiced roots singer to emerge at any point in JA is all but guaranteed to be compared to Luciano, for better or for worse. Solid artists such as Natty King, even the elder Prince Malachi and especially Bushman draw continuous comparisons to the Manchester native for there voicing styles and even though each hold a nice and more than slightly respectable space within the music, none have as of yet been able to capture the magic as consistently as Luciano has seem to (when Natty King was coming forth he even used to bill himself as Luci B or Luci Jr and performed singing Luciano songs in respect to his idol). Also, apart from inspiring the younger (and older artists) Luciano has had an excellent working relationship with many of his peers. There is no wondering what a Capleton, Anthony B or even Beenie Man combination may sound like as Luciano has worked with them all on very nice tunes of varying success. And he also did his part in establishing one of the most promising talents to ever emerge from Jamaica as well as Sizzla Kalonji originally got his international experience opening shows for Luciano during both of their rather long stints for Fattis Burrell at Xterminator, showing Luciano's influence to be not only amongst his fans, but his peers as well.Coming forth to 2007 and already Luciano's second official release of the year (with a very very fine mix tape also his credit) after February's very solid Revelation Time, we get the wonderfully title God is Greater Than Man from Cousins which finds the artist working with a relatively new and very nice label. In the past 12-18 months Cousins has pushed forward with some very fine material, releasing albums for such acts as Lutan Fyah, Tony Curtis, and on the very same day as this Luciano album, an album, Stronger Than Before from Turbulence. They have also formed somewhat of a working relationship with In the Streetz Productions, a record label ran by producer Byron Murray and Clifford `Mr. Vegas' Smith, as In the Streetz helmed the production work for not only both Lutan Fyah's album for the label, You Bring Blessings and Turbulence's Stronger Than Before, but the label has also released riddim albums for the producer. The relationship, in fact, made the nature of Luciano's album for the label even much more anticipated as I thought maybe we would see an ultra-quick turnaround release for the sequel of last year's Child of a King album which saw In the Streetz doing the production work for Luciano on that VP album. Nonetheless, what we do have here is very very unique in its own way, even though Murray's hand isn't in it at all.The story of God is Greater Than Man is actually one that has been long written before and time and time again, but I'll never tire of hearing it. While the lyrics and arrangement of the album is typical Luciano standard fare, the mix here is that a nice portion of the album has that very very classic feel to it, and the results at times are divine! One need only plop the cd in space and push play on the first track to know exactly what I mean.The album begins on the very strong Running For My Life. Bubbling nicely over vintage Duke Reid (there are a few nice Duke Reid pieces here, more than any other single producer for that matter), Running For My Life does exactly what it was meant to do and for all the real reggae fans out there, you will immediately lose yourself in the record WISHING that maybe Luciano could have come forth just a couple of decades prior to his eventual arrival, but luckily some of those older pieces are truly timeless! The second track, Bring Back the Vibes finds Luciano taking on another piece from one of reggae's finest producers of all time, this time the legendary Bunny Lee and on a downright magical song which speaks about doing exactly what it is:"bring back the real vibes round here, that's what the people want to hear, turn up the sounds make them play, and then we dance `til the break of day!", just the perfect example of exactly what the album as a whole is about, pushing the vibes back and forward at the same time, taking a step back to go two steps ahead. As you step ahead through the rest of the album what it is actually takes on its true shape. God is Greater Than Man the track is an older song for Luciano, I believe it came forth 2002-2003 and it IS a big track without a doubt. God is Greater Than Man, the album, is a pretty much a compilation album, albeit with a few nice new pieces, compiled by producer Donville Davis, so he'll get the partial credit for bringing these tracks together. Davis, now that I think of it, served a similar function on Tony Curtis' album for Cousins Records, Leave the Collie Alone from 2006 and complete producer credits for Frankie Paul`s Are You Ready and Michael Rose`s Babylon a Fight, both recent releases by Cousins.Getting to the majority of the album, although the opening two tracks of God is Greater Than Man are exceptionally strong (as is the third), the finest piece on the album altogether is definitely Give Thanks & Praise and although I could probably sing you about 15 different tunes from different artists with the exact same title, this one stands out. Bubbling just divine over a classic classic Reid riddim (which was rebirth on Bitty McLean's MASSIVE Baby Tonite, and for me listening to any song on that riddim is almost double because I'm also singing Baby Tonite in my head at the same time) the tune lives up the very high standard of any tune ever recorded over the riddim ultimately just by making one simple yet lovely request, "Stand up and tell me do you love the creator!". I love the song and although it probably won't be pushed very well at all (and it probably already has been released somewhere) but the track is probably one of my favorite Luciano has EVER recorded, yes its that good!Check Kingdom of Jah over the classic Conqueror riddim by Bunny Lee (from Cornell Campbell Gorgon fame), again, just a nice merger of generations on the track and credits go to Davis for setting that up as it is a very recent recording and one specifically mixed for this album. And I'm really looking forward to seeing Davis' other projects in the future because it appears as if he definitely has a great feel for the music, not only the older artists, but the modern as well. Go forth and Luciano actually enters the hallowed halls of Studio One on the excellent and `lightly' pounding Borrowed Time. Borrowed Time is a tune that sticks with you in that old style where the riddim didn't deviate much from that basic one-drop (and you HAVE to hear Luci on the one drop) but gives it to you so hard that it stays in your head to the point where you continue nodding your head on that beat despite the fact that the next track, in this case the excellent newer Strive, has began. I have to recommend to you Cheer Up (which starts like he`s about to start singing MANY RIVERS TO CROSS!), which is a song that points out everything I've ever said about Luciano's music just making you feel better, in this instance, Luciano makes a point of telling his woman that he'll be back soon from tour and to keep a joy and cheer up, but as is most of his music, it is applicable in far greater circumstances as well. Lastly, check Take Me There, another Studio One piece which ends the album (save for the Bad Situation remix which isn't too dissimilar to the original Bad Situation) on a fine fine note and one a slightly more up-tempo note. My only real critique of the album is that it comes and goes entirely too quickly!Overall, I'm definitely not only recommending God is Greater Than Man for all true reggae fans out there, I'm hailing it as one of the best albums of the year! I love the fusion of Luciano in particular with the older vibes and having just last year heard Sizzla do the same thing on the excellent Waterhouse Redemption for Jammys, hearing Luciano go the same route is just as interesting, I'm even more interested in seeing just who will make that decision and do it next (I think an excellent choice would be Norrisman). Dancehall has recently been going through a stage (which appears to be dwindling now actually) which the older dancehall riddims have received second and in some cases third chances with the current group of artists and I'd love to see the more rootical side continue going through it as well (check Gaddafi's wicked relick of Marley's Redemption Song riddim, now called the Old Pirtes), and should the trend continue, and actually develop there can be not too many better choices than the Messenjah, definitely check out God is Greater Than Man!

Roughly every 4 years or so the fraternity of dancehall elite will open its doors and welcome a 'new' member or 2. These artists aren't typically NEW at all, however, they have now reached a level of popularity and (usually) ability which warrants their promotion in the dance. A few years ago it did so and in walked Vybz Kartel and Assassin. A few years before that there was Ward 21, TOK and Ce'cile.This year its the turns of Busy Signal and Idonia. And it just so happens that Busy is up to bat first. Busy, hailing from St Ann's (home!) has somewhat followed in the steps of Kartel: An indepth idolizing of Bounty Killa, followed by a meeting with the Warlord, a few years on the underground and finally hitting the big time with his mega boomshot, Step Out. He also signed a deal for his debut (and i believe 2 followups) with UK reggae giant Greensleeves. His style could even be perhaps best described as a combination of the Killa and Kartel (as you could probably best describe Kartel as a combo of Killa and Madd Anju), and he has had much much fanfare over his seriously top notch skill.While not as lyrically dexterous as Kartel (and who is) Busy has an almost blind aggressive command over a track which makes all of his tune, if not at least worth the price of admission, then definitely worth listening. However, what he shows on his debut, which you couldn't have imagined Kartel showing. . . even until recently, is a soft spot.Taking in account that Step Out is Busy's debut full length album (and he produces it) it is well impressive. The best tune is definitely That Bad. That Bad is an ultra-clever ode to the rest of the dancehall (and even some out of the dancehall) taking lines from nearly everyone from Kartel to Killa; and from Kalonji to the Fugees! The song is somewhat along the lines of Kartel's Robbery and Kiprich's Baby Song, just well done, and arguably better than either tune.Also check the combinations: The Bounty Killa combination, Do The Maths (interesting Kartel and Killa had a combination called Maths Automatic) is exactly what you would expect, the knock you over the head militaristic style showdown. Check the second single Not Going Down which is a tune with a message described as a straight jump up dancehall record. Busy even comes armed with 'his own' Wayne Marshall who Kartel came up with, in Movado with whom has 2 combinations with on Step Out, (same as Kartel's debut Up 2 di Time) the best of which being Full Clip.The similarities may end there between the two artists however, as Busy has a complete other more 'experimental' side. He has a tune here named Love Me Not which is about as vulnerable as you would ever want to see anyone on a tune (but the tune quickly grows on you I assure you!) which features Reanno Gordon (aka Busy Signal) as he goes Wayne Wonder and Red Rat by creating the alternative identity on the nice tune. My second favourite tune here is actually I Love Yuh which features the angelic Alaine, on just a wonderful tune which could spin on US radio right now, I'm sure! The second half of the album actually goes in many different softer directions, he has another nice combination with Kris Kelly, since you been away, and an interlude which features him just calling his daughter. The album even ends with Pon di Pole, a PURE SOCA song!While I made a point of drawing a few curious similarities between Kartel and Busy Signal (the seemingly wild headed Idonia has very little in common with the 'Sassin) rest assured this is no carbon act. Busy Signal's debut Step Out marks the arrival of a significant new talent in the dancehall. And while it will take you over mountains and pretty much everywhere else (including 3 videos) at the end, you just might be on the groundfloor of something really special if you pick this one up.

Jet Star's Toe to Toe series is always a wonderfully welcome guest on the reggae compilation racks when they are released. It's such a simple but unique idea to pit 2 artists 'against' each other in a back and forth manner and when the right pair of artists are set together, the album can be a wonderful thing, it is of course all dependant on which tunes they get from each artist, but artist next to artist is a very very good concept which the people at Jet Star have been successful with as this, the most recent release is episode 9. Previous editions have feature Luciano & Bushman, Sizzla & Capleton, Sizzla & Junior Kelly and Elephant Man & Vybz Kartel.This edition features two of the most exemplary of all young Jamaican roots talents, Richie Spice and Jah Cure. Richie Spice has music flowing through his blood as his 3 older brother are all reggae musicians themselves (most notably Pliers from Chaka Demus and Pliers fame). His style is more of a straight forward singing style, however there is nothing at all straight forward about his voice. Spice's. . . simple wail can be both beautiful and regular in the same tone, his style is reminiscent of neither of his two singing brothers both of whom sing a higher pitch when at their best. His style is very out there (thus he is the MARS in the equation).Not as far out there however as his 'opponent' here. Jah Cure is wayyyyyyyyy out there. I have no idea where he got that shockingly beautiful tone that he sings in. His voice is unlike anything else in all of reggae music and he can make really normal lyrical songs into something magnificent. While he can be (and is often) compared to singing versions of both of his friends Sizzla and Jah Mason lyrically, his voice puts him into a completely different class of roots music.This edition of T2T is very good. The artists are matched very well. Spice scores very very well on his opener, This Train as well as on the combination with his older brother Spanner Banner, Don't Worry (which I'm frustratingly sure is over a Marley riddim I just cant remember which tune). His most impressive effort, however, is easily the closer Slang a Slang, which is a simple song about some girl but just works on so many levels.Its difficult not to favor Cure in such a combination however. Take a cursory listen to his Most High Cup Full over the 'Sun is Shining' riddim from Marley and you hear it immediately, its all about that voice. Even when he doesn't make it quite over on a song, such as on Have a Dream on which he does his best Jacob Miller/Ini Kamoze imitation, let any other artist do the same tune and its horrible, its even recorded bad! But his voice bails him out. Check the beautiful Heartbeat over the same riddim which backed Anthony B's hit Mama Forsake You. His best is easily Jamaica, the complete and utter testament to his voice on this album and a powerful statement for the island which in a fair world would back the countless 'Come Back to Jamaica' commercials airing.Neither artist get to their absolute best material (which is no shame of course) but both give a fair shake of their B+ material throughout the album, which is impressive enough. And I love this idea by Jet Star, I'd love to see more such as Tanya Stephens .vs. Lady Saw, Sizzla .vs. Turbulence (almost inevitable) and Jah Mason .vs. Junior Kelly. Were this an actual competition, its definitely close, but:Jah Cure by Unanimous decision.

The Universal Message series by VP is a nice series which they only seem to touch on every 2-3 years or so, this latest edition follows #2 which was released in the fall of 2001, the first installment saw life in 1999, and needless to say, this is an underappreciated and underpromoted series over at VP.Predictably it takes from many of VP's bigger artists, so of course you have material from Capleton, Sizzla, Luciano and Morgan Heritage, all pretty solid efforts, Junior Kelly as well. That's all good and tight.Capleton and Sizzla have 2 of the best tunes here, no doubt, That Day Will Come is huge and Ain't Gonna See Us Fall might be Sizzla's best culture tune in a while, and Luciano's Give Praise is one of the best songs I've ever heard, but what really shines here are the younger and not-so established types. 5th Element is well represent as both Chuck Fender and Richie Spice offer big tunes from their new albums with I Swear and Blood Again, but you also have Turbulence's beautiful Hail to the King, great great opener to his last VP record. You also have a really nice song by someone called 2 Isis whom I've never heard of called Ghetto Pain, really cool song, deep song. And you have German import Gentleman on one of his bigger songs, Dem Gone.All that being said, the best stuff here, I-Wayne's huge Living in Love, Morgan Heritage's vibrant Uncomfortable on a song that really needs to be heard and FANTON MOJA! on Hungry, huge huge record! Big future in store for Moja and I-Wayne. Through in some Junior Kelly, Tanya Stephens, Bushman unexpectedly Wayne Wonder and you have a pretty nice album.Overall, this could very well be a 5star album for you if you're not too familiar with the music, having been listening to about 75% of these tunes for months now, it's not as hard hitting for me, but if you haven't been listening, it can certainly be better for you. Yes, it's that good, hopefully we wont have to wait until 2009 for #4.

One of music's most pertinent mysteries may be exactly how a slight Jamaican reggae artist named Sizzla Kalonji is able to release 5-6 albums a year without his sales dropping significantly on any of them. The first thing for a new reggae label to do is seemingly to get out a Sizzla album.Stay Focus becomes Sizzla's first full length VP Records followup to 2002's megahit Da Real Thing (Da Real Followup?)And NOPE, its not nearly as good as that album, but that doesn't mean that its garbage either, its predecessor was legendary. Stay Focus' biggest problem is that Sizzla pretty much goes as hard as he possibly can on just about every tune, occassionally when he slows it up he finds magic, he also finds it hard at times, but I would guess that its a result of his sickening level of rhyming over Xterminator riddims over the years (the man could problem give you about 3 new tunes on X riddims he's never heard before if you awoke him from his sleep one night.The best tune here is one on which he does actually go hard, the opener Psalm 8, enteresting way in which that tune was built. Also like We're the Ones, probably the best tune lyrically on the album, like the closer Jah Will Must Be Done, Stageshow (incredible tune to hear live), Thinking About You, the title track and Original.Overall, for fans of the artist, this album is somewhere between the Light of My World album and the Be I Strong Album: With the pace of the LOMW album (with which it shares the tune Whole Heap a Woman) and the direction of the BIS album. Either way, yeah its another Sizzla album, you know what you're getting, and you already know if you want it or not.

Although its not all that common and is actually quite rare, sometimes even with the massive amount of music that I listen to, I do happen to run into something that catches me completely off guard. Either something I just picked up, just because, or something which I wasn't expecting to enjoy all that much that sneaks in and turns itself into a winner. Such is the case with the Consuming Fire riddim, the latest offering from legendary dancehall producer Augustus 'Gussie' Clarke. The Music Works cheif has made an extraordinarily beautiful riddim and assembled an equally fine roster of artists to voice it as well. The result is one of the better produced riddims and riddim albums of all of 2006.With the serious saturation, and some may argue of the OVER saturation, of these types of albums in reggae music, a producer getting his riddim to standout, particuarly amongst non reggae fans is a very difficult thing. Every year you see dozens of riddim album which go virtually unnoticed by the masses, even here, where the largest fanbase is. The art of making a standout riddim has even become more and more difficult these days than in the golen age of reggae music with the dilution of the talent base as well as the producers themselves.Luckily, master producer Clarke has long had experience in making some of the finest material the genre has ever seen and has been serving on productions for over 30 years. Most notably being the architect of two massive riddims, the Rumours, which spawned Gregory Isaacs huge hit of the same name and the Full Up, most notably used to back the Mighty Diamonds' MASSIVE Pass di Kouchie. As new producers continue to pop of every day, Clarke is one of the ones who are definitely no come lately and has withstood the test of time making big successes out of not only himself and his label, but many of his artists and musicians as well.The Consuming Fire a beautiful piece! Its built on top of a nice piano and nyah drum backing, which is somewhat out of character for Clarke, but right in the range for master drummer and arranger, the legendary Bongo Herman who lent his talents to the riddim. The riddim sounds not too much unlike recent riddims such as Vendetta's Seasons or the Reflections riddim from Moses. And the real big story here is the roster assembled by Clarke covers a great deal of the lineage in reggae music, from artists such as Freddie McGregor whom Clarke has continually voiced over the years, to the unknown and up and coming such as Lil Joe.Lil Joe actually owns the first single here, the wonderful Not Good At All. Seeking to establish himself amongst some of the finest roots talent out there, Lil Joe lays a BOOMSHOT on the Consuming Fire with Not Good At All, possibly scoring the big hit which reggae careers so desperately need so early out of the gate. The tune is immediately followed by Do You, the wonderful track from demonically wicked lyricist Tanya Stephens on a track which apparently just missed the deadline for her recent huge album, Rebelution.Going through the entire album you quickly discover the strength of he riddim as well as the strength of the artist selection of Clarke. There are no bad songs on the Consuming Fire, instead, each song has a well powerful base and each of the artists do an excellent job with their tunes, respectively. Check Blood on Dem Nozzle by Chuck Fender and Sorry by Turbulence. I bring these two up together because for some reason, I haven't been exactly impressed with either of the two as of late, but both tunes find them somewhere near the height of their skills, particularly Fender, whose tune is amongst the finest on the riddim altogether.Definitely give several listens to Chanting by the the up and coming Katalys Crew. Chanting is a top notch track for the new Xtian Gospel reggae crew (and to anyone who may know who Pressure Busspipe is, you have to hear the song, the lead vocalist, RADIC, sounds exactly like him, to the point where I originally thought the crew was some branch of the Star Lion Family). Of course check Luciano's Mighty God is He on a riddim which sounds as if it was virtually made for the Messenger; check the fine fine JC Lodge tune I'm on Fire, one of the signature tracks on the riddim (and probably where the name came from as she mentions the title in the lyrics), the song is teh finest vocal performance on the album altogether (and check Heather Cummings' speak out as well).All that being said, My 3 favorite tracks on the CF are even bigger! Check Kalonji's Put All My Trust in Jah! The song is MASSIVE! And hopefully VP keeps it in mind (even for a possible title track) for his next for the label. Then check (and its nice how they put them all in a row for you) the unknown Shantia on In Exchange for My Vote, showing a young lady with a wonderfully conscious side, the song is MASSIVE! But the finest effort altogether on the Consuming Fire is without a doubt Natty King's big big tune, Care for Life. Care for Life is one of the best efforts of King's entire career and it almost seems like the riddim was made for the vocals. His style is forever similar similar to Luciano's however, in this instance, he outshines even his brilliant inspiration (and I looooooove the extended piano bridge to the record).Overall, definitely recommending this one to all fans of modern roots reggae. What was most surprising was even still knowing the title, the Consuming Fire, but where's Capleton? You almost have to have the fireman over such a titled piece. But the ones who are here do a fine enough job to make the Consuming Fire riddim one of my absolute favorites of 2006!

Luciano is probably one of those people that at the end of his career (or his life, he'll probably be singing this wonderful music for the rest of his days), can look back and be happy about every single step he ever made. Every note on every tune, packed into every album, every stage show, every tour, every fans hand that he shaked, every contract that he signed, and every interview that he ever did, he'll be happy with all of it. And Luciano just might be the hardest working man in music (with respect to Sizzla) if he's not on tour, you'll notice that some label somewhere has an album from him on the way.There isn't much to say about the artist musically, with the exception that he writes and makes good music. Were there to be a guide book of exactly how to make good, simple neo-roots reggae music, at the very least Luciano would be a top consultant if not the artist himself.Serious Times, the 2004 installment of his on-going relationship with reggae giant VP Records. Different here, from what I've noticed is that absolute genius Dean Fraser is working the boards here. Luciano is rarely in better form than on songs like the opener Give Praise, and possibly the albums best track Alpha & Omega, big big song. I also like on the covers of Feelings, a really really good song and was actually my favourite here until I gave Alpha & Omega a 2nd and 3rd listen. Also love Ras She Want, and The World Is Troubled.Overall, really really strong album from the Messenjah. Serious times is solid from beginning to ending, and Rasta or not, it just makes you feel good, due to the hard title and serious tunes, and the serious topics, you go in with an expectation for a certain thing, but Luciano's style of writing has never been to totally accentuate the negative, its about accentuating the alternatives and as he says on the title track Serious Times, Serious Measures "Serious Times, require serious measures, lets put away the war and crime, its life we should treasure", this album is seriously crucial.

I've had a fairly good track record when it comes to listening to the various roots reggae artists coming from outside of Jamaica, particularly in the Virgin Islands. While other islands, mainly Trinidad, are going about making a name for themselves just now in reggae music (and Trinidad is coming up HUGE!) the Virgin Islands have been making their name for in reggae for more than a decade. With names like Bambu Station, the up and coming Star Lion Family with standouts NiyoRah and Pressure, the I-Grade label of artists (which includes such names as NiyoRah, Ancient King, Army and Guyana native Yahadanai), and of course at the helm of the movement is the Midnite Band.And it is Midnite who is at the helm of Troddin to Zion, the debut (and to date only) album from St Croix native singer, Ikahba Stone, who has such an unusual vibe and makes the album easily one of the best reggae debut's I've heard in a very long time. I had only heard of the artist through a brieft interview clip prior to a friend a few months ago making a recommendation that I IMMEDIATELY check out Trodding to Zion.So I took her up on the offer, (as she had previously made a rec. that I check out the truly WICKED Sabbattical Ahdah, also of St. Croix). And the results were amazing. Ikahba has a very different style which is not derivative of anyone directly, however, he sounds like several different artists put together. In the interview clip I heard, he mentioned one of his greatest inspirations was late Jamaican dancehall singer Tenor Saw, and you can somewhat see that vibe as well as a style somewhat derivative of Midnite lead singer, and primary executive producer of this album, Vaughn Benjamin. He drifts in and out between pure chanting and pure singing and I love the vibes!So unusual is this combination of inspiration, that often times you might find yourself wondering through the duration of Troddin to Zion's relatively short 11 tracks that a different artist is taking almost every track. However, credit is due to that versatile style of Ikahba for pulling off such a magnificent album.The best song here is probably what is lyrically the most aggressive song on the album, Wha Happen to Dem?. The song is built over a well powerful one-drop, and Ikahba goes about casting down nothing but condemnation for the wicked, as he mentions in the hook, "Ask dem what happen to dem? Rastaman come happen to dem. Then ask dem again!". Wha Happen to Dem is a huge huge tune!I gave this album a 5 star review (which I hadn't been doing that much recently) because every song on here could be a winner on its own. Check every last one of them! Particular standouts include Fast Life, a song not too dissimilar to I-Wayne's Can't Satisfy Her. Also loooooooove one of the only two combinations on the album, Dem Skylarkin (a rather poignant tune for the time) with the even more unknown Mash adding a nice nice aggressive chant to go with Ikahba's singing. The combination, which was originally due to be well known St Croix chanter Batch with Ikahba, works even better as Mash actually sounds like a younger version of Vaughn Benjamin.Two of the other really big tunes here include the first song on the album which made me know this was a truly big album, the opener, Jah Will Lead the Way. The song sounds like a complete midnite production and had I not known they (pretty much just Vaughn Benjamin himself) were at the helm before, I would have almost surely gone rummaging through the liners looking for a production credit for a 'V.Benjamin'. The other really really super strong track here is the title track and the second combination. You can almost immediately tell when the mighty-voiced, strong and sassy Dezarie touches any track and she blesses Troddin to Zion with a supremely divine touch making it one of the more powerful combinations I've heard on a VI roots reggae track in my rather brief experience with the genre (also check NiyoRah & Pressure on the nice Afrikan Chant on Niyo's latest album, Purification Session). The two generally tour together (and Dezarie STAYS on tour) and its nice to seem them voicing a song together in the studio, having previously seen clips of the two, together sharing a mic on stage.And check the rest of the tracks which I didn't mention, particularly the closer War Monger, with the nice nice nyah drum backing over a strong one-drop and the penultimate Let Jah Take Control.Overall, definitely stamping a large stamp of recommendation on Ikahba Stone's Troddin to Zion. The album, which was released nearly 3 years ago, desperately needs a followup. This artist is entirely too crucial to bringing VI reggae to frontlines, where it deserves to be, not to be heard. Definitely go and check this one out (it is apparently pretty well available on the west coast of the states and of course through ordering), and see one of the truly wonderful pieces of roots reggae coming out of the Virgin Islands.

Is it that time of year already? The Reggae Gold compilation is without a doubt the single most popular reggae compilation that there is in the world (which is saying A LOT considering that there are a billion of them) and is probably best used as a litmus test of the music for the rest of the non-reggae listening world. To put it frankly, even people and groups of people who do not really like reggae, check out the Reggae Gold compilation and one could make the point that besides being the most popular, easily, it is also the one which has attracted the most new listeners to the music. For example, there was a rather brief 6 month period during the year 2002 when a song by VP artist Sean Paul named Gimmi di Light was absolutely taking over the world. I myself, living in the states at the time was very proud that the music had attained such heights, but was growing very tired of the song (especially considering that there were 3 even more powerful tracks on that same riddim, The Buzz, by Beenie Man, Sizzla and Mad Cobra, respectively). The song would eventually lead to a bidding war for the artist and then ultimately a bidding war for the releasing rights to the entire independent label itself, which Atlantic Records would win on both accounts. However, before the eventual November release of Sean Paul's major debut album, Dutty Rock, the only (legitimate) album on which you could find the absolutely MAMMOTH track (not including the regionally released Buzz Riddim album which dropped the previous September in the Caribbean) was the May 2002 released Reggae Gold 2002. After that, similar situations occurred with mega tracks which were released before the artist's album actually reached the road; RG 2003 featured Elephant Man's mega international hit, Pon di River, Pon di Bank six months before his album, Good 2 Go was released; RG 2004 featured Beenie Man's equally large hit Dude for Dave Kelly and featured a remixed version of the tune with US rapper Shawnna (for which the international video was shot), a version which to this day has yet to see the light of day on any other official reggae release. VP Records, the label which is responsible for pushing the compilation every year, is slick! The label generally packs the albums full of releases from their artists (particularly popular are the ones with albums on the way and those with very recently released pieces), slides in one or two odd remixes with American artists, a big name or two which they don't have under contract and a couple of unknowns. The result is generally a greater access for all involved one way or another.VP Records is ran like a well oiled machine and if you really love reggae music (or if just are really interested in the genre), you will definitely find yourself having to deal with VP in one way or another. This is largely due to the fact that they boast some of the finest talent in all of the Caribbean and they do an international promotion for their artists on a level perhaps unlike anything the music has ever seen. As of this writing, VP's roster of artists is absolutely ridiculous! Besides maintaining at least partial rights to international superstars such as Beenie Man, Sean Paul and Elephant Man; they also have reggae superstars such as The Messenger, Luciano; Capleton; Morgan Heritage; Beres Hammond, who hasn't had an official non VP release in over 10 years, and although Lady Saw recently completed her contract with the label, her current release, the well solid Walk Out is in their hands to promote and care for. Besides those names, the label boasts serious roots talent in the form of three young geniuses, I-Wayne, Warrior King and Gyptian; and not to neglect the dancehall, their roster of young dancehall talent includes TOK, Assassin, Kiprich and the recently inked hit maker Mavado. If you know nothing about reggae music, yes, this is a very big deal! Not to mention that I've forgotten such names as the Warlord Bounty Killer, the dancehall poet Tanya Stephens, Richie Spice and Junior Kelly (although you wouldn't know that because Penitentiary still makes a point of releasing albums by them) and soca heads Bunji Garlin and Edwin Yearwood. The label is stacked! Their roster is the equivalent of a single NBA team having four of the starting five of an all star team in any given year, and the following year and even the following year. If you make reggae music also, you have to deal with VP in some form or another as well in any aspect of the business. They sponsor tours for their artists, have their excellent and ever-growing Riddim Driven series which links them with some of the finest producers Jamaica has to offer, and other artists, who are not signed to the label and yet routinely have albums released, such as Turbulence who has had four VP releases to date, Glen Washington, Buju Banton, Anthony B, and most notably the legendary Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and Sizzla (who himself, by my count, has had 10 VP releases). Again, if you are into the music, or even if you just KNOW about reggae music, the name VP Records definitely needs to be one with whom you are familiar.This year's installment of VP's signature series, Reggae Gold follows a year in which reggae, although not in the international spotlight (perhaps largely due to the continued postponement of Elephant Man's Bad Boy debut) as much as previous few years has actually been very solid. Although, a quick perusal through JA tabloids and newspapers (and some would say those are the exact same thing) might make you think some of the bigger names spend more time fighting amongst themselves than in the studio: With Bounty and Beenie's decade old rivalry hitting new heights (or depths that is) with the inclusion of an `Angel' (and Bounty's own seemingly endless women problems); Vybz Kartel's unhappiness with his label, Greensleeves and ultimate departure from Bounty's Alliance (along with his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Aidonia) and bloody war with latest VP signee Mavado and many other things that music overcame (and used) to its benefit in making one of the finest music years in recent memory for reggae. The proof is in the pudding as RG 2007 is without a doubt one of the finest installments the series has seen in quite a while and it doesn't depart from the lineup which I mentioned at all. It is still, relatively a glorified promo album for VP Records, but what a solid promo it is! This series is typically hit-or-miss style and truly the better VP Records series is so consistently without a doubt the double annual installments of Strictly the Best, but Reggae Gold 2007 does an excellent job in attempting to close the gap and this year, all you who make this your one reggae album of the year to check might be looking for something else which interests you later as the new comers here absolutely steal the show, but the one or two older heads present do themselves fine as well.First, just getting the bad out of the way: I live in somewhat of a reggae box. If I'm not listening to reggae music or soca then there's an African vibes playing, other than that, I don't get too international, therefore, as of writing this, I had NEVER actually heard the song This is Why I'm Hot by Mims (and I can imagine someone somewhere is sitting down writing a review of a `hip hop gold' styled album and mentioning that "you're probably well tired of this song by this point") although I had heard of it. This remixed version of the song (which I guess is basically a Baby Cham and Junior Reid combination over the original track) I do not like very much at all, it almost kills the early vibe of the album sandwiched between a ridiculously over hyped Watch Dem Roll by Sean Paul over the migraine inducing hype Tremor riddim by Stephen McGregor and Mavado's epochal Kartel aimed Top Shatta Nah Miss over McGregor's massive Power Cut riddim. The song is the obligatory odd remix with a foreign artist and, as usual, the song just doesn't work here. Then there's Elephant Man's answer to Buju's MASSIVE Driver tune, Bring It, which just doesn't bring very much over the same riddim (which should have been retired immediately after Buju put that genius piece on recording, the song pretty much never gets off the floor and fittingly at its conclusion, Ele gives credit to where its due, Buju. And lastly (literally) the closer, Shaggy's More Woman which lags far behind some of his other far better work as of late (wouldn't an excellent way to end the album been with his megahit Heathen?!!!). And I've been called a reggae snob, so if a Reggae Gold album comes down the road 15 tracks deep with only 3 bad ones, its definitely a winner!The good? To all those people who have asked me in the past sixteen months where they could get that Morgan Heritage tune about NYC and Jamaica, here you go! I'm not the biggest MH fan in the world but I definitely have to concur that the tune Brooklyn & Jamaica is amongst their finest work over Shane Brown's well powerful Statement Riddim. Check the man himself, Buju Banton reuniting with Penthouse where he got his start on yet another riddim called the M-16, this time, an absolutely divine sounding Dean Fraser cut which melds itself around Buju's very Driver-ish flow. AND THAT'S IT representing for the older heads the balance of the album's top notch material is put out by artists on whom the international spotlight has yet to shine, but hopefully and obviously is making its way towards. Check the magical Sticky by martian voiced singer Jah Cure. I could perhaps never tire of hearing Jah Cure and following the past 12 months where the artist had been less than active (perhaps in anticipation of his release which is now scheduled at just about a month and a half away as of this writing), Sticky is a great big WELCOME BACK to the Montego Bay native over Ce'cile's new riddim, the wonderfully old school spiced Jam Down riddim (which always has A LOT of people on the dance floor and whose album is actually due the same day as this RG 2007, also on VP). (and don't be surprised at all should Cure's release from prison coincide with the announcement of a signing with VP as he has released two albums with the label since his incarceration)Heading the relatively brief dancehall portion of the album is definitely `hybrid' dancehall artist Munga Honourable's Bad From Mi Bawn. The self proclaimed `Gangsta Ras' who boasts of not only having the backing of dancehall ace producer Vendetta (over whom's excellent techno spiced Sativa riddim the track flows) but David House, label home of the Prophet himself, as co-managers, knocks an absolute homerun with the track which has become one of his biggest to date and don't be surprised if VP's next big dancehall signing is Honourable at all (unless of course Greensleeves again catches them off guard as they did with both Busy Signal and Vybz Kartel (and Fantan Mojah for the matter). The one that didn't get away from VP, most recent addition to their roster, sickly looking brutally efficient hit maker Mavado, offers two equally bullet laden tracks with the aforementioned Top Shatta Nah Miss and Last Night over the Show Off riddim. The better track is probably Last Night, but both are fairly equally solid tracks with both offering a decent taste of Mavado's vibes, but neither actually defining his shocking cold efficiency in the dancehall. The second half, and actually just about the final third of Reggae Gold 2007 is where the real quality lay on this album, however (of course minus Shaggy's closer). Pick any of the songs there and you'll have a winner! Starting with the young Tessanne Chin's (or Tami jr. as I'm calling her) beautiful Hideaway. I'm good and tired of the couple of years old Hideaway, but it's still an excellent track, which is barely reggae, save for that excellent guitar riffy one drop at the song's beginning, but an excellent inclusion to the album giving an international spot to what has undoubtedly been one of the most popular songs in the Caribbean over the past couple of years. Then there's the enigma that is I-Wayne. The downright peculiar singer who has attracted some of the most. . . Peculiar criticisms and praises of any young artist to date pushes forth the excellent lovers track I Need Her In My Arms, and while I'll always prefer the fire spitting and lava condemning I-Wayne, his offering for Reggae Gold 2007 is definitely amongst the strongest tracks to be found anywhere on the album (and hopefully this winter we'll see his sophomore studio release).The top three tracks here definitely make themselves standout from the rest. Check Gyptian's ridiculous and frustrating My Fadah Seh which comes not too far after his album to make you wonder why it couldn't have made it, and. . . Not too far after his album to make you know that by time the next album rolls around (unless of course Gyptian is going to be following Sizzla's time schedule for releases) that the track will probably be too old to be included (and don't put that past VP to do anyway). Even with the presence of the MASSIVE Beng Beng on his debut, My Name is Gyptian, had you dropped My Fadah Seh on that album, it would have instantly become the finest track on the album, the wonderfully spiritual track is easily the finest tune young Gyptian has ever voiced. Then there's the odd man out on the album, Pressure Busspipe, whose cause I've been championing since I heard his debut album last year, links with Vendetta and the St. Thomas native pushes one of the best lover's tracks modern reggae has ever produced! Love & Affection is MASSIVE! So much so, Vendetta has taken such an interest in Pressure that he has signed him alongside Munga to his label and subsequent recordings from the duo have hit the street (especially the wicked Be Free), definitely Love & Affection is a big break for the artist showing just how far VI reggae has progressed in its short time. Lastly. . . Easily the best song on this good album and easily the best song I've heard in a while is ridiculously lovely songbird Alaine's Sacrifice. The song is something off an angel's play list and out of, of course, Vendetta's studio, it's a big chunk of romantic and lover's magic that you NEED to hear DEFINITELY!Overall, in typical hit or miss style, Reggae Gold 2007 is a big hit. Also included is the now customary DVD which goes behinds the scenes (and even a little around my neighborhood!) definitely needs to be watched as its stocked full of cool pieces and frames, and as general, a nicely produced project outside of the music, VP always puts their best foot forward on the Reggae Gold album. Not as usually, I'm recommending this one to just about anyone, newer fans, definitely this thing is built for you, but older and more established fans, this is the first official cd for many of the pieces here you will LOVE the DVD.

Typically this album will come out in May or June, and I will comletely be caught off guard, everytime I catch myself going "its time for the soca gold album already", and while it was previously just a sidekick to the Reggae Gold series, this 'Robin' album for the last few years has ridiculously outshone its 'Batman' counterpart.This year is no different as 2006's installment has mighty big shoes to fill as '05's was sooooo huge with the vibes. Things are a little more relaxed this year, but the vibes are still there. And, disarmed with the customary mix cd accompaniment, and re-armed with a nice little useful DVD in the package with nice footage, this one seems fit to set the tone for future installments. And by the same token, if you're a fan of Caribbean music, go and look at the tracklist for Reggae Gold 2006. . . go ahead I'll give you a second. . . Finish? Exactly, you know all those songs!I went to Carnival in TnT this year and had an excellent time! One of the best of my life, just a great time! And I was really looking forward for awhile to this one, even though I'm still vibing to 2005. So this year, unlike previous, I have a few 'complaints' (not real complaints): I don't know if anyone has yet to make VP aware of a little artist named Destra. . .; We couldn't get a some kind of version of Ganja Farmer by Marlon Asher, I know its nowhere near soca, but last time I checked, you put Sasha on 2004, start getting this artist out there someway somehow!; and what about the Sizzla-KMC combination? Would have looked nice! And MY SONG! Where's Maximus Dan's Warrior?(told you they weren't real complaints, just wanted to look like I've been paying attention)Kudos go to VP for getting Dawg E Slaughter back on the album with one of the finest efforts here altogether with the excellent UP in DAT. The song is reminiscent of the big sounding tunes like Bounce and Trample which got me listening to the artist. Love Up in Dat bad! That's not to say that its the best song on the album however. That distinction belongs to Fay Ann Lyons' truly excellent That is Carnival! I LOVE that song, if it doesn't do something to you, I'm sorry to tell you, but you died somewhere along the way!The girls here really outshine the boys, with Fay Ann accompanying unknown (to me) Ms Alysha on the wonderful Party and soon to be booming star Nadia Boston taking over on One Island. One Island is kind of what I consider that quintessential soca that is not that over-powering type of marching feel. Its more laid back, but still has that big vibe, excellent tune! (okay maybe putting Destra on here might have overloaded my senses!)Of the boys doing well is of course Slaughter and Bunji. Bunji dropping the SECOND best tune for the Soca Boys on Warriors Coming. I also REALLY like Mista Vibe's Ting 4 di Road. The song sounds kind of messy, but it reminds me of one of my favorite soca tunes ever, Thelma by South South West. (to date i haven't finished Ting 4 di Road because i always go and pull out Thelma!)Also check out upset winner of Monarch this year Shurwayne Winchester with Calypso Rose on Tempo, nice nice tune. Former multiple Monarch winner Iwer George finally back here, sounding very good on We Reach.See! You let me talk about this album long enough, i'll recommend nearly every tune! I even like Carnival Feeling, with another female in Rita Jones shining!Overall, I always love this album. Soca Gold gives a good mix of the different style's of music. But it's generally a direction where it tries to go. 2004 was all over the place trying to hit as hard as possible, '05 was even more all over the place, but toning it back just a tad, this one tones it back a little more, quite a lot like 2002. But it makes it work, and it also includes the DVD allowing the average fan to put faces with the music. With TnT making it (and giving a mighty fine effort in the process) to the World Cup this year, soca continuing to have a presence in the mainstream with artists like Rupee, Kevin Lyttle and Destra on the rum commercial, this might be one of the most important installments of this one, and musically, it lives up to it, definitely recommended!(oh yeah and I forgot about Park It, by Explainer, big tune! And hilarious!)

I absolutely love this book. Never really one for reading, this book has kind of enthused me to go back and actually READ some of the dozens of books I had purchased over the years but never really set down with.As a descendant of Rastafarians (and a person whose family majority consists of Rastas, I found it very interesting, and answered some of the questions more distinctly than any of my family had in the past. Its mainly about Leonard Percival Howell, &quot;The First Rasta&quot;, and talks mainly about his life and times, but the parts of this book that i find most interesting are the parts that deal with other figures in Rastafari culture i.e. Selassie and Marley.As I said, I was never one for reading too much, so if this book got me re-interested in reading then there is definitely something to it. Written by the ex-wife of legend Alpha Blondy. If you're interested in the topic, not a bad place at all to start.

(4.5stars)I have to admit, one of my greatest joys as a music fan has always been discovering new artists from different walks of life and different styles of making reggae music. With the music now actually being just about as finely promoted as it has ever been, the limits of the reach of reggae music has grown tenfold and artists from the farthest corners from walks of life which you would never imagine could feel the vibes are now producing and involved in producing reggae music. Over the years, we've seen very significant reggae artists emerge from areas not only outside of Jamaica, but outside of the Caribbean altogether. Names such as Lucky Dube from South Africa, Gentleman from Germany, and of course the Maxi Priests, Ras Shilohs and a whole heap of other names from out of the UK and USA have all gone to show reggae music (and perhaps even more significantly and specifically, roots reggae music) to have such a powerful vibes which cannot be contained by purely by the Caribbean alone (although of course we claim and boast (and will continue to the end of time to claim and boast) (because we're right) to having the absolute best reggae being made anywhere in the world). True, reggae music, once solely identified with Jamaica, has now become a truly international and worldwide vibe. The result of this, depending on whom you ask is both good and bad. The good? Well undoubtedly for the artists themselves, the music has never been as commercially and financially viable as it is at this time, there's nary a region in the world where reggae musicians don't at least perform on a semi-regular basis; also, with that avenue of travel and spreading now opened to the music, the future figures to only show a continued increase in the popularity and spreading of the music. The bad? The reggae purists amongst us (of which I am qualified as) may have a problem with that spreading as it is a chance that the face of what reggae music is known as may someday no longer be exactly just what is going here in Jamaica first and foremost, and other places whom are more open to mixing the vibes with other forms of musical vibes may actually receive the same credit in reggae music as Jamaica, though producing a well diluted form of the music; also, some of our musicians previous works have now been opened to the international world along with their new pieces, the result of this can be found anytime the discussion of misogyny and homophobia in the dancehall is raised. Still, amid all of this, to date at least, we've seen absolutely fantastic artists entering the game from nearly every direction, who at least SEEM intent on doing the music how the music was intended to be done.Amongst the various reggae artists over the years from outside of Jamaica who have made a great impact in the music the world over is the legendary Ivory Coast native Seydou Kone', better known as the brilliant Alpha Blondy. Alpha Blondy ranks as one of the very few living truly International Reggae Superstars (just thinking of other names which also qualify under the title, names like Burning Spear, Sean Paul, Damian Marley, Beenie Man can lay a claim to such a title). It is definitely fitting that when the conversation turns to French and Francophone reggae has to at some point pass through Alpha Blondy as the current situation in French speaking reggae music is blowing up to a peak previously unseen anywhere in the genre. Young acts from not only the country of France itself, but also in the very talent rich French West Indies are making themselves known to the international world, representing places such as Martinique and most notably, Guadeloupe. I myself have just recently got into the vibes of Francophone reggae within the last year or so, having moved part time to the half French (and geographically much closer to the FWI) St. Maarten where the vibes are greatly appreciated as well. Having previously only taken an interest in two French reggae artists Guadeloupe's Admiral T (who is apparently the biggest name in French dancehall) and Martiniquian Sael, who is probably my favorite French speaking reggae artist overall. Other names I've come across and enjoyed since I began listening include the likes of Straika D, Daddy Mory, the outrageous Lord Kossity, the very nice Slikee who I stumbled across very recently on the very nice compilation from Vikings, Rasta Legacy Vol. 1 and Tiwony. Then there's an artist whose name I've heard before, but really never gave an honest chance to, this despite buying his first album which until very recently (in fact after listening to this album) sat comfortably forgotten in the back of a closet. However, further inspection would reveal that this artist, the aptly titled Lyricson (perhaps even `Vibeson' might have even been a little better more characteristic, but `Lyricson' hold suit as well) would have eventually certainly forced himself into my players sooner or later on his own. Of all the artists I've mentioned I see no more greater, nor likely heir to the throne of Alpha Blondy than Lyricson, one of the single most unique reggae artists you'll find anywhere right now. Besides being Blondy's literal neighbor, having been birthed in neighboring Guinea to the Ivory Coast born Blondy, Lyricson shows all the signs necessary for a developing roots reggae artist, and I'd go so far as to suggest, were he actually a born Jamaica (or even just a resident, see Natural Black) Lyricson would ALREADY be a rather large name on the island and in the music. Out of all the `Francophone' roots reggae artists, definitely Lyricson is the one who should claim the most of your attentions.What is easily most unique about this French speaking artist is that you'd never know he was French speaking based on his music alone. Although I've seen interviews with the artist where he converses and chats in French (his homeland, Guinea used to be a French colony named French Guinea and the national official language of the country is still French) the supremely cultured youth chooses yet a different language in which to deliver his message. Be it through deciding that the a `different' route may be more viable or choosing to honor the music in it's original form, the French resident sings in patois styled English. His style is one that is somewhat unique, he is a singjay in the purest since of the word and probably the artist who best comes to mind when analyzing Lyricson's style is Turbulence. Imagine a higher pitched (think Warrior King or an exaggeratedly louder version of Gyptian, but not all the way up to I-Wayne heights, though not terribly far away from that) slightly less agitated version of Turbulence and you'll have a pretty good general overstanding of Lyricson's style. Also, much like Turbulence, one of his greatest assets and abilities is something which is almost the element of surprise in that you'll almost never know exactly what he'll do with a track having the skills to go nearly pure singer and nearly pure DJ and a mix between the two at any given time. His previous album his debut, 2004's Born 2 Go High was recorded for Bost & Bim at Special Delivery Records (who also produced Queen Omega's most recent album the divine Destiny) and now he comes forth with his sophomore album the ultra sleek and solid Keep the Faith for French label Jouquet (which I've never heard of before and further research reveals that Keep the Faith is the labels maiden release) and distributed by Nocturne who I am familiar with, being the distributor for many fine albums over the years, most notably, Jah Mason's opus, Never Give Up. And although I'm doubtful this album may ever reach shelves (but then again, as I mentioned with the spreading of the music, perhaps it will) in the west outside of the Caribbean, all fans of modern roots reggae are doing themselves a great disservice by not tracking down Lyricson's Keep the Faith.Lyricson's previous producers aren't gone completely as they provide the backing for three very solid tracks on Keep the Faith. The most solid of which is undoubtedly the very nice hard driving one drop for one of the best tracks on the album, Don't Give Up. Don't Give Up has one of the best hooks on the album as well and one of the things which has to be said about Lyricson's style is probably best evident on Don't Give Up; he has a way of writing which is almost time delayed. You don't really grasp exactly what he said the first time through (and this will happen normally if a riddim for a particular song is just so outstanding or odd that its difficult to concentrate on what is said) and you'll often find yourself between the first and second listening being able to really appreciate just what was said in the song, definitely check Don't Give Up, very powerful tune. Bost & Bim also provide the backing for the very serene Be Wise & Conscious and Keep On Moving with the latter being the stronger track (actually one of the better on the album) but the former is not too far behind. A great deal of the production here is done by names which are either completely new to me or newer in the sense that I've encountered them recently on French productions.Such is the case for Moolood who I `ran into' on Tiwony's most recent album (which you need to check out as well, entitled Fly) who produces some of the finest pieces on the album. First check Choosen Ones which is at worst, the second best track on the album, I go back and forth deciding between it and another track as to Keep the Faith's finest piece, I'm leaning towards the other now (probably because I'm listening to it now) but Choosen One's we'll call 1B. Very very powerful roots track which goes so nicely with Lyricson's natural style. He takes more of an aggressive style on the track but drifts back and forth on singer and DJ and its truly something very nice to hear, very nice track. Moolood also chimes in on Solid Ground with the big Frenchie roots riddim the Purple Ting which I swear sounds like something made strictly in downtown Kingston, a BEAUTIFUL one drop with a very nice horn (it may actually be a remake to an older riddim which I don't recognize), I remembered hearing the riddim on the heavy voiced Tiwony's opener for his album as well, Priye' Jah (probably the best tune on Fly) and I'm starting to think maybe Moolood needs to come with Lyricson the next time he comes to yard! His other productions includes the very nice lover's track Only Lady and `lastly', he also does the foundation for the opener and scores not only the second best track on Keep the Faith, but also the finest overall. Give Jah Praise is about as fine as new roots track I've heard all year and one of the most impassioned pleas for Rastafari you'll probably ever hear. The wonderfully packed full sounding track leaves absolutely nothing to be desired and Give Jah Praise is definitely worth the price of admissions to Keep the Faith alone.Other tracks definitely worth hearing include, first and foremost the very powerful Jah Me Call On which shows just about every style Lyricson has in its 4:02 and is yet another very strong praise to the Almighty Jah Rastafari (again, you have to credit reggae music for the spreading of Rastafari as well, truly a tool of His Imperial Majesty). The song flows nicely over Elohim's MASSIVE Black Marianne Riddim which I recognized as well from Tiwony's album Fly, utilized on the track Oupatebizwentousa. Definitely check Jah Me Call On. Have to mention the beautiful Repatriate which sounds like something out of Vendetta's one drop catalogue, and is a creation of Ghost, the lead producer of the entire album a very interesting selection coming from a native son of the motherland for whom Repatriation of himself is not a very hard concept at all, but definitely the track is for the rest of us. Check the nice Youthman Rise, probably has the best one drop on the entire album; and lastly check Live Upright which is the only combination from Keep the Faith featuring one of Lyricson's friends from his Black Unite crew, young Guadeloupe native Suga Moss, who for his part, does his various portions of the tune in French while Lyricson sticks to English. Very nice combination over Blackhouse's well powerful Poutchi Riddim.Overall, I'm definitely recommending Lyricson to ALL fans of modern roots reggae. Keep the Faith is a very interesting album in that, THIS album now becomes the one (along with Lyricsons first album, but this is the more solid of the two) to start with in order to appreciate the French vibes. I'd also recommend the aforementioned Rasta Legacy Vol. 1 album, however, that album features French artists over Jamaican vibes, this is French artists over French vibes and the result is one of the better reggae albums over the first half of 2007.

Another year, another Reggae Gold Album. 2003's edition of the best-selling reggae compilation picks up where almost every year before it seems to have left off. What this album does is offer contemporary examples of all types of reggae music from the biggest artists around and throws it all on the same disc and puts it out there. Due to its high profile, and its annual star-lineup it usually attracts fans from hip-hop and pop and that accounts for its great sales.This year is absolutely no different. All the hot artists on the hot riddims. VP really does put their best foot forward on this one. Poster twins, Sean Paul and Wayne Wonder both hold their place with there hits Get Busy, and No Letting Go (LL Cool J's remix), Sean Paul gets in the action twice with supporting role on Busta Rhymes' out of place Make it Clap. You even get Shaggy's Hey Sexy Lady. By virtue of its mere presense on this record the best tune becomes Sizzla's monster Thank U Mamma, with the second best being the legend, Beres Hammond's awesome 360 Turn. Also really like Tanya Stephen's It's a Pity and, of course, Morgan Heritage's She's Still Loving Me. And of course, the sickly addictive Pon Di River by soon to be posterboy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man's effort along the same lines Row Like a Boat. Bounty Killer is here twice, and two times wicked going solo on his own The Greatest and the second time with reggae royalty Mad Cobra and Spragga Benz and Assassin. And even Buju taking his turn on the "Thank U Mamma Riddim" on One on One (which i admit sounded flat out wrong to me the first time i ever heard it, but its grown on me)So whats the bad part? If you don't really listen to reggae all that much, or if you listen to the music but don't buy albums, i can see this being a very fun album. BUT! If you're like me, and reggae music makes up at least 80% of the music that you listen to, you'll be hard-pressed to find a song on this album that you don't know, which means that it get's really boring, really quick. In fact you might even already be tired of about half of these tunes before this album was even released. So this album is by no way something for everyone.Overall, like i said, if you're suddenly enraptured by dancehall vibes now from listening to Sean Paul, Wayne Wonder and Beenie Man, then by all means go out and pick this one up, definitely. But, if you at all fell in love with the music in the previous decade, then avoid this one, you can sing all of these songs to yourself whenever you want to, you know them that well.On a side note, I have to show respect to Vp for putting out the best music in the world on the world's greatest stage. Reggae Gold will of course sale well (helped by the flat out inevitable video for Elephant Man's Pon Di River) and it serves best to hardcore reggae fans as a reading of VP's mind. Meaning, expect albums from not only Elephant Man, TOK, and Beres Hammond this year, but Tanya Stephens and Sasha's debut as well.

The Sweat riddim, the latest from super-producer Donovan 'Vendetta' Bennett is probably one of the strangest riddims that he has ever done. It takes awhile to grow on you, but should you actually sit down and catch that vibe, it is a big big vibe.The problem with the Sweat, if there is one, is that it leaves itself a little too open to vocal creativity. It doesn't change much, if at all, outside of the opening it doesn't change much at all and it never creates a melody, so there's a chance that if the artist isn't doing anything with a particular tune, the riddim won't come close to making up for it.So when you make a riddim like that and choose to voice artists like Kiprich & Predator, Alozade, Voicemail, Bling Dawg, Anthony B in an apparent bad mood, Don Mafia and Hollow Point, all of whom fail to hit the mark, it becomes a matter of over-voicing, this album itself would have been nearly remarkable had it been about 8-9 tracks shorter, as it is, it is slightly above average.Several of the other artists do hit the mark with their tunes. The best tune here is the opener Come Again by Beenie Man, Beenie goes off all scales and drops the boomshot on Come Again, the song probably shows exactly what I mean by it depends more on the artist with this particular riddim. Also impressive is Capleton on Toppa Tings, easily second best tune here.Macka Diamond also does a pretty good job on her dissecting Ugly Man, it is so creative, however, that it almost renders Predator (whatever happened to him?) and Kiprich's counteraction Ugly + Tax completely ueless. Also, having been less than impressed with Bounty Killa's most recent offerings, I was expecting to skip his Mad 'n' Psycho, but the tune finds the Killa in his finest form in quite a while. Also, one of the best tunes here is young Busy Signal's Agony, the song is pure and simple straight dancehall, but the flow is nearly flawless with it.Also, later on the album, Munga, of whom, I've never heard before, impresses on his witty Bad Like I, and I loooooooove what Vendetta does in making sure that Alaine gets on all of his riddims. Listen to this album straight through and watch yourself rejoice when you get to her Whine as it is a relief from all the hard madness in the 14 preceeding tracks.Overall, this one isn't your typical Vendetta production at all, you won't find that powerful thumping in the riddim, but if you are a fan of the producer you can see the beauty in this thing and it just might work for you, if you're not a fan, then avoid it all costs.

Since the day this record came out it has been in rotation in my players. WK's vocal's are some of the best in the business but he doesn't over-do it like he so clearly could if he wanted. His writing ability is exactly right where it should be at this stage of his career, and his choice of tracks is as well. The best track here in my humble estimation is Health ad Strength, it's vibe just does it for me, an amazing tune it is, also of course like the opener, which took people by storm when they first heard it, despite never officially being released as a single, Power to Chant. Of course the 2 previous singles were fantastic in the title cut, and Never Go Where Pagans Go, check Breath of Fresh Air as well as it sounds perfect here as does Oh Mama with underrated dub poet DYCR.Warrior King fits in perfectly as probably the young artist with the most potential all around in cultural roots reggae music. Artists such as Warrior King, Jah Cure, Turbulence and Lutan Fyah represent an up and coming talent pool much much deeper than the future of its brother dancehall (although future stars such as Vybez Cartel, and Assassin are no slouches at all) and hopefully those artists can break into the world view as dancehall has done, albums like Virtuous Woman, Ghetto Life (Jah Cure), A Different Thing (Turbulence) and especially Friends for Life (Legend Buju Banton) are certainly more than a good start. AMAZING! GO GET IT!

I've been mentioning recently how every few months or so I'll go through and clean out my closet running into literally dozens of unopened albums, a great deal of which are riddim albums. And this year was no different, I found several riddim albums which I now am currently vibing to (i.e. The Caribbean Style, The Lion Paw, the Tiajuana etc.) and at the same time I am currently filling the empty spaces in the closet by buying new riddim albums which I almost certainly won't listen to for another year or so (i.e. the Full Draw, the Twice Again, and the Inspector).Then there's the case of the French Vanilla. I rather vividly recall purchasing this album on the day it was released and enjoying it CONSTANTLY ever since. The French Vanilla riddim was one of the earliest built by one of my favorite producer's dancehall ace, Vendetta roughly three years ago. The riddim features a nice Spanish guitar combined with an all around hard driven riddim. The thing is so, 'casually strong' and it almost oozes the confidence of the producer.For the most part, Vendetta taps his usual cast of characters to voice the riddim (i.e. Vybz Kartel, Wayne Marshall and Sizzla) then there's the obligatory new and up and coming artists (Da'ville, who is now well established and Timberley) with the balance of the tracks being held by veteran artists of varying popularity and quality. And, as I'll maintain now, Vendetta, besides making some of the best riddims in all of dancehall, chooses just the best artists for a certain riddim and will make the right choices on who to voice and who not to voice on a particular riddim, thus, he also makes some of the best riddim albums out there now.While the mid-level and of course the bottom level of tunes on the French Vanilla riddim suffer GREATLY, the top tracks here are absoulte A+ dancehall. Amongst those are both Vybz Kartel's tunes. Goodas is an odd sounding, but rather clever tune which takes Kartel's usual lyrical set and exaggerates it throughout the song, almost to the point of being comically clever, but Kartel knew what he was doing on the tune definitely! His other tune, Murderer is amongst the strongest of his entire career. Murderer has a flow on it which is so sickening it warrants the overall premature comparison to the legendary Papa San which Kartel seems to receive so much these days.Also checking in on the top flight here are Assassin and Ward 21, with both expounding on everything critics say is wrong with dancehall today. Assassin's hit Girls Gone Wild is flat out brilliant! This song, perhaps better than any other, flat out glues itself to the French Vanilla and it ultimately was to become the signature song on the riddim. Ward 21 checks in with prime level Ward vibes on their very nice and ULTRA clever Like 'S'. The song of course, is very very slack but will have you sitting in your car wondering exactly what they're trying to spell.However, they all pale to comparison to the best track her, which is without a doubt Style Yuh Want by dancehall poet Tanya Stephens. Stephens goes cleverly slack on the tune which is her normal style, but combined with addictive riddim makes pushes it to the head of the class.Of the rest of the tracks, highlights include Lady Saw on the vocodered Dis Gal Ya, with Saw continuing to stake her claim as the Queen of the Dancehall and in the middle of this songs, it also rises to the top flight as well. Check Sizzla's Think of It. This is the hype, violent foul mouth Sizzla going crazy over a riddim, and its a powerful song! He somewhat mirrors the riddim as he's simply aggressive on the track, nothing special, no crazy hooks, just aggressive and hardcore dj style. Check Spragga's Gal Can Whine with Spragga doing a fine job on the style of riddim that he was made to voice! The only pure singer track on the riddim, Jump Off by Da'ville is decent as well and features one of the few slight variations of the French Vanilla (as does Sizzla's Think of It) and Timberley's Red Hot playing the caboose on the album and she represents as the 3rd female, quite well.Overall, I've thoroughly enjoyed the French Vanilla for the past 3 years or so and figure to continue to do so. I can't say its exactly anything special (thus the 4 stars) or anything dancehall hasn't seen before. But if you're a fan of the music you know that Vendetta builds exceptional riddims, and while the French Vanilla was one his earlier ones, there is no dip in quality.

(4.5stars)The concept of CLASS in terms of not only the music but how one carries and handles oneself is an almost lost art in this current era of dancehall. For that matter the art of COMPLETE class is one which has pretty much ALWAYS been absent from the game as, almost from its inception, the dancehall has (and continues to) thrived on the rude and lascivious vibes (and I guess it says SO MUCH about me and literally millions of others (including YOU probably) that we love it so much) of the music. It has typically been to the roots side you would go if you were seeking a more classy, role-model type of artist, much in the mold of the Garnet Silks, Lucianos and Everton Blenders of the world, as rootsmen who have kept it upstanding and uplifting both musically and literally. Although there have been a FEW artists over the years who have reached the dancehall who have managed to offer what we would call CLASS vibes. For example, as of late, I would definitely say that (Baby) Cham is exhibiting a level of vibes which could definitely be described as GROWN UP or mature dancehall as the days of Baby Cham potentially competing with the likes of Bounty Killer and Vybz Kartel for the right to carry the dancehall's biggest gun tune are all but forgotten and have been replaced with a far more adult approach to the dancehall as well as mixing HIGH LEVEL conscious vibes into his work as well. Definitely one of the artists who has been a bit controversial, although musically continuously on point has been Buju Banton over the years. Now you may full on disagree with me there (and the brunt of your argument would undoubtedly hinge on dragging up an almost twenty year old tune), but if you REALLY take a look at Buju's dancehall over the past decade or so and shine some light on his roots career as well, you definitely see a musically upstanding individual and one who has survived some questionable personal events to survive not exactly unscathed, but OBVIOUSLY more mature. And the top choice would have to be Ms. Tanya Stephens who has, over the course of her most recent two albums, Gangsta Blues and Rebelution turned her version of dancehall into the `grown folks hour' offering her simply BETTER look of the dancehall from a far different position than 99.9% of her musical peers. You also have the presence of some of the elders such as King Yellowman who (in between maintaining his LONG obsession with King Yellowman!) has been a wonderful ambassador type for the musical style which he helped popularize and was one of the first TRUE superstars of.You also have artists ever so seemingly slightly past their primes coming back (or STILL maintaining) for a level of vibes which they once enjoyed, although maybe not at their previous levels of popularity, but to demonstrate sweet sweet vibes for those who're willing to check for them. Such an artist is the DIVINE Nadine Sutherland! Ms. Sutherland's is a voice I am all but certain pretty much ALL fans of modern music in the west have heard as she has been present on some of the biggest dancehall tunes to ever reach out of Jamaica. When Snow, the Canadian who not too long ago took the attention of the international dancehall crowd on the strength of his hit Informer, was at the height of his powers he did a BIG combination with several well known Jamaican artists including Beenie Man and Buju and who was singing the seemingly unforgettable hook? Nadine Sutherland. Maybe you might even recall her singing opposite Buju on his earlier hit Wicked Dickie. If not then you will DEFINITEY recall the name Terror Fabulous and do so ONLY because of the tune he did by the name of Action. He didn't do the song and you may not remember the name of the woman who sang opposite him (but you do remember there was a female singing), that too was Nadine Sutherland. Now you may not know that she has been not only one of the classiest predominately dancehall artists OF ALL TIME, working with artists from so many generations; from being one of the very first artists Bob Marley signed to his Tuff Gong imprint, through working with the Bujus, Beenies, Terrors, Sanchezes and Spraggas of the world and all the way to working with the stars of tomorrow in the form of super high-tech dancehall DJ Aidonia. You might not also know that she has been a fine (in more ways than one) example of a fantastic representative of not only dancehall and all of reggae music in general, but for Jamaica as a whole as you through her various advertisements and sponsorships (as she is one of the few RESPECTED dancehall figures to whom a product can be linked without any worry AT ALL); as well as appearing as a judge on a very popular television show, Jamaican Idol (aka Digicel Rising Stars, you get the point) and even briefly writing for a local paper. You might not also know that she has continued to record music and in 2007 she returned with what was her very first album in a decade (her first was a self titled piece for Xterminator, released by VP in 1997 which is all but impossible to find these days and I myself only own the original LP vinyl) the very lovely Call My Name for 876 Records. Call My Name is an example of what class will do for a dancehall artist (or any artist for that matter) as there will NEVER be a style of music dominant in Jamaica in which Sutherland will be out of place. And although her music may not be the most popular, when her time is done she may actually leave a better lasting impression on more people than her far more popular and active peers. 876 is a just a few years old ran by production veteran YahBreeze which attracted quite a bit of attention on the strength of some of its earlier releases, highlighted by an very solid release from veteran singer Chrisinti, Again and . The label did a very fine job in building and promoting Call My Name and to my ears, the results are one of the greatest dancehall EXPERIENCES of 2007.Nadine Sutherland has always been an artist on her own who has had somewhat of an R&B; style within the confines of modern dancehall. She won't (usually) give you what you'd expect from the likes of more popular female artists Stephens and definitely Lady Saw (apart from the obvious, her being predominately a singer; them being DJ's for the most part), but definitely manages to stay within the confines of dancehall or reggae music (although she trods very close to the edge at times). Getting things started is a tune which, in retrospect, could have done quite a bit of damage given the opportunity, the downright magical Its My Day. If I had ANY reason to go anywhere for the majority of 2007, Its My Day was a tune which was well in the play list of my `driving music' because of that lovely bounce and addictive chorus. The tune itself is one of overcoming obstacles set in your way throughout your life and really, obstacles NEVER sounded so go as on Its My Day. While I definitely feel as if Its My Day could have been a big success were it pushed, one of the three tunes here which were pushed (and three is a very nice number for any album) was the next tune here and it proved that Sutherland's name could still be a commercial success, the BIG, Big Tingz. Big Tingz is just a big Caribbean melting pot of a tune as Sutherland shouts out West Indians all over the region and those living in foreign lands as well (even St. Maarten!). The YahBreeze produced clip was a big hit and could probably be called one of the biggest of Nadine Sutherland's storied career as it was playable on pretty much EVERY reggae/soca (the riddim actually does have a bit of a soca `twang' as well and fittingly so for the message of the tune) station and show (there was a very VIBRANT video accompanying the song) in the region and it played quite consistently for quite awhile and you STILL hear it every so often. Definitely one of the biggest tunes here and probably the signature track of Call My Name, the album. Rounding out the opening of the album is a little slower piece which is just as impressive as its two predecessors, Just A Little Bit. The tune is actually a song about living and acquiring some experiences (both good and bad) and still keeping focus on goals and dreams that are out there for you. Definitely a very nice vibe (over a very complex riddim, highlighted by a stirring acoustic guitar) and lovely way to end the opening.There were two other singles from Call My Name to my knowledge (alongside Big Tingz) and they (along with that tune) definitely represent the CLASS of the album. First is the biggest of them all in my opinion, the `consciously ADDICTIVE' Keep Me Safe. This tune would have been the first that I had ever heard from the album before even realizing there was one forthcoming and I have LOVED IT ever since. The tune speaks of all the negative things out there and asking the Almighty for the strength to continue the journey and for safety along the way. That's one thing, the other thing is that its built over something SO simply brilliant that Marley himself would have approved. The result is a tune which in my opinion will live on for quite awhile as one of the best tunes of Sutherland's career, if not THE best period (also check the very nice video)! The other tune here which has a big name value because it received a nice push (and another video) is the album's only official combination, Can't Tek It alongside Sutherland's `stablemate' Chrisinti an dthe two make a very nice pair. Chrisinti has an unusual LOUD type of vocals (he sounds like a chanter who can ACTUALLY SING!) and he doesn't make too many combinations on his own, but longtime Nadine Sutherland has proven herself capable of working with virtually anyone and he is no exception, Can't Tek It is BIG. For obvious reasons the somewhat `folksy' title track also stands out. If I look beyond the backing (which I don't like), straight to Sutherland's wonderful vocal performance (which I do like), then I can definitely see the power of the tune and to be honest (embarrassingly) the I even like the `riddim' SOMETIMES on the heavily meditative and spiritually vibed title track. After the big names on this one, Call My Name takes a decidedly reggae twist with some very nice far more traditional pieces coming as it proceeds. Check the wonderful old school dancehall vibes of Remedy a tune which finds our star calling out for her special doctor for that special `dosage' she so badly needs and its DEFINITELY how a MATURE sexual dancehall tune can sound and it is a real highlight of the album (which finds her using a more unconventional approach as almost a straight DJ). The tune Running Away carries a similar vibes as well (although more rootical) and a very nice message, the tune almost doesn't even exist, however, as it comes and goes VERY quickly to my ears, still a nice vibes even. Another Day is another SWEET vibes to take a few listens through as it finds Sutherland sticking what SOUNDS like a straight forward lover's style ballad R&B; tune into a reggae vibes and I really like the results at the end of the day. The tune is an example of what I mean when I say she stays within the confines of reggae, but definitely pushes the border and by all means if you happen to be a big fan of R&B;, check the tune, you'll love it. The nice vibes continue down the stretch of Call My Name as the two penultimate tracks keep the reggae vibes going strong. How Long is a tune which finds Sutherland getting over a bad and stressful relationship and looking forward to a better future. Again, its the type of tune COMPLETELY more familiar in an R&B; spectrum, but the veteran makes it work here as well over a pretty straight forward old school bouncy dancehall styled riddim. Things stay circa 1975 with Where Did My Heart Go yet another very solid tune before the DIVINE ballad Why Do Doves Cry ends Call My Name and if you keep a tear out of your eye then you're better than me as Nadine Sutherland sends us out with one of the album's most impressive vocal performances.Overall, Nadine Sutherland's is a style which is mother to the style of artists like dancehall songbird Alaine and recent upstart Althea Hewitt and should those lovely artists amount to HALF of what Sutherland has, then we're definitely in for a treat. I LOVE and am so APPRECIATIVE to Eight76 for taking the time to craft the album specifically for her and to promote it very nicely, both locally and apparently abroad as well as the album was, to my knowledge, the label's most commercially successful project to date (which MAY mean that we'll be seeing a follow-up sometime in the future). Call My Name is a BIG album, one of the best of the dancehall from 2007 (I'm calling it a `dancehall experience') showing exactly what a PROFESSIONAL, MATURE and CLASSY artist can do with her vibes, whenever she likes. Now hopefully we won't have to wait another decade for the next one.

(4.5stars)The current new class of roots reggae gets more and more impressive by the day, seeming to endlessly add another remarkable talent to the bunch, making it, arguably, the finest young group of roots talent in a very long time here. Names such as Turbulence, I-Wayne, the lethal Jah Cure and Natty King figure to at some point in the future take up the reins for such artists as Capleton, Luciano, Sizzla Kalonji and Anthony B. Mixed firmly into that mix of youths to come, and arguably at the head of the class is Spanish Town native Lutan Fyah. Where Jah Cure boasts his earth shattering voice and I-Wayne manages to combine his seemingly never ending passion for righteousness into a sickly heavy bundle of vibes, Lutan Fyah's 'hidden talent' is boasting one of the deepest bag of lyrics you'll find anywhere in reggae music over the past 20 years or so.I first became aware of the former football standout actually while I was living in the states and he had voiced some material for California's excellent Lustrekings outfit (including one of my all-time Fyah favorites to this day, No More War), and had then set out seeking more material and possibly and album from Fyah. Although he is critiqued by some because of his melodies (which honestly isnt his strongest point), one listen to a song will tell you IMMEDIATELY that this whole lyrics thing isn't too much of a problem for Fyah at all. The debut album came in late 2004, Dem No Know Demself, and was immediately followed by the Lustrekings album, Time & Place.And now, 3 albums later appears You Bring Blessings from UK based Cousins. The label, which was responsible for last year's excellent and overlooked Leave the Collie Alone from veteran singer Tony Curtis, and has released albums for such veteran vocal names liek Michael Rose, Al Campbell and the excellent Richie Davis (with the superb Nubian Woman) is continuing in recording the newer artists to nice effect. You Bring Blessings comes on the heels of an excellent 2006 for Fyah which saw him release not only the excellent Healthy Lifestyle on his VP debut, but my choice for 2006's reggae album of the year, Phantom War for Greensleeves, as well.'Blessings' is probably best described as a half step below combination of the vibes of Time & Place & Phantom War, which is definitely not a bad combination to be linked to. The album also finds album producer extrordinaire of the moment, Byron Murray from In the Streetz hooking up with Fyah. Thus, if you happened to catch 2006's Home & Away from Norrisman, Child of a King from Luciano or Wheat & Tears from Jah Mason (or just happen to be a big reggae fan) many of these riddims will be familiar to you, but of course still up to date and hearing Fyah on a session with them is very impressive still (and I'm happy Cousins picked it up, but I imagine Greensleeves would have done the same if they intend on a 2007 album for Fyah). Both Fyah and Murray's reputations continue to grow, so an album just seems like the next big thing from the two (and I wanna see a In The Streetz Sizzla album this year too!)The best tune on You Bring Blessings is probably the absolutely delightful opener, Desire to get Higher. The world class vibes built on top of a lovely nyah drum backed riddim is more than an excellent way to start off the album and the new year and I'm almost a little 'upset' that it didn't make it on the LOADED Phantom War. Curiously enough, Phantom War contained NO Murray productions, all to the benefit of Blessings! Go along in that same vibes and check the excellent title track over the Desperate Lover riddim, which is just a fine fine track, I remember hearing the riddim for the 1st time (I believe on Norrisman's Feelings Deep Within) and thinking about the possibilities it could have, and You Bring Blessings definitely builds finely on that vibes.Also definitely worth checking is the wonderful Never Stop Hail Rastafari over the enchanting and HUGE Street Swing riddim. The song is definitely one of my favorites from Fyah altogether and again, would have fit lovely on the Phantom War album, but I digress. I dont think I've ever actually heard a Fyah tune which I thought was BAD, and this album is no different, as its completely brimming with nice vibes. Check Stand in My Way over the minimalistically beautiful Mobay riddim; the two relationship tunes in the middle of the album, the stronger of which is She's My Sunshine over the Million riddim and followed by the still strong No More Pillow Talk over the nice Free Life riddim as well.Also present is the obligatory After All, the combination between Fyah and Norrisman which is on Norrisman's album Home & Away as well, still a well strong track closing the album out; And I'd be doing you a disservice to not mention the superb Never Get Enough!Overall, definitely recommending You Bring Blessings by Lutan Fyah, with an excellent way to kick off the new year. The album is pretty much everything you've come to expect from both artist and producer. And to that reggaehead out there, just be honest, you were listening to Mason's and Norrisman's album thinking Fyah would be excellent over some of the same riddims! I know I was, You Bring Blessings definitely doesn't disappoint and doesn't fall too short of the absolute best work of Lutan Fyah's career.And just to add on, EARLY 2007 is vibing nicely NO? With 3 albums ALREADY out from Fyah, Turbulence and Norrisman (Captura), Midnite dropping their obligatory 3 January albums again and Richie Spice to drop a boomshot next month, its an excellent time to be a fan of the music.

Anthony B has spent the greater part of his musical career trodding a road this somewhere between average and spectacular. He is one of the most consistent artists you will find anywhere. Perhaps what is truly spectacular about the artist is his consistency. Unlike his more publicized counterparts, he'll rarely dip into the average, or even below, into the experimental stage, his material always comes at a certain level and he could easily place a seal of quality guarantee on his music, the man just does not make bad music, he is consistently solid.The album Black Star comes as totally unexpected, it is not normally the way of the label, Greensleeves, to release an artist's album who is not one of their own (unless his name is Sizzla), they have enough trouble putting out their own artist's material (Black Star becomes the first artist's album released by the label in 2005). So it was truly a good thing to see that they had not only put out an artist's album but a surefire winner such as Anthony B.What you can say about Black Star is that it is truly a solid project. The best song is without a doubt the unique combination with the destructive voiced Jah Cure on Poor Man's Cry. They make for a very good pair and the song flows wonderfully. The other combination is with Ras Shiloh, who as normally performs more than adequately as he continues to invoke the spirit of the late great Garnett Silk in his style. Also love the forgiving and understanding I Understand on which the artist makes a plea for fairness as a cheating man with a cheating woman; love World a Reggae Music riding the soon to be timeless World Jam riddim; Praise Jah is also a big big tune.Another tune that I really like is Black History. Anthony B dips into the dancehall over a nearly pure ska riddim and the song just really works as he says "Mek wi talk bout Bob Marley di hero of Jamaica country". Rastafari Crown also works late on the album as does Sunshine.Overall, you can never really have too much Anthony B on the shelves. Black Star might be his best effort in a while, absolutely since 2003's Street Knowledge. There are no hints of a bad song, its a very cool project with the artist appearing more like a factory worker on his lunch break on the cover than a royal Bobo Rastafarian. Good from beginning to end. Its mandatory for fans of the artist and maybe a pretty good point to start for the less familiar.

I can't imagine that I'd actually ever sit down to read this book, from beginning to end, I mean, now that would be boring, like watching grass grow, or reading a math text book from beginning to end. However, that being said, I don't think that this book was meant to be read in that way. It is a buyer's guide, and strictly as a buyer's guide, it is very good. Like another reviewer here, this book has cost me some serious dough indirectly, searching for, finding and purchasing some of the classics in this book has ran me over 2 thousand dollars. I lie the format where they give a brief accounting of the type of music for the chapter, then break it down by the artists and their best albums. It even has a dub section which is very extensive, and the best of its kind about this oft-forgotten type of music. It brought back memories, of my father playing tunes by Fred Locks, Tappa Zukie, Augustus Pablo, Yabby You and the Congos when I was younger, (I'm only 21) and I was able to purchase alot of those albums for my own collection. And my father owns the book, he's 47 years old, owns approximately 60% of the material in the book, and he's been listening to the music for approximately 47 years, and he loves it. In my opinion, if you just approach this one as what it is, a buyer's guide, then it'll work for you. I also like the way it handles Bob Marley and the Wailers, it gives a very in depth summary, but it doesn't over-do it, as many books on reggae does. And it also goes in depth on Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer as well. It covers very in depthly the current era of reggae as well, with the dancehall, and conscious vibes well touched upon. Overall, I say if you are a collector of reggae music, especially a newer collector, then this book will work for you, it does all of the research for you, gives you 100% of the labels, so you can go directly to the source, and get the material you want. Very very good!

Love Always is a classic. If you don't have it, you should've had it a long time ago. There isn't a bad song on the record, there isn't a bad verse on the record. My absolute favorite is Don't Rush. Nothing more to say, go get it.

The Strictly the Best albums from VP Records are usually pretty good at getting something their Reggae Gold albums may have missed or something that hadn't been big enough at the time when the Reggae Gold albums were released and just generally used to positively promote their artists and reggae music in general. The cover is usually some artist's rendering of a dance and its always attractive and beautiful and there's more than one person in the world who'll know nothing of the music but will buy it on cover art alone, I'm sure. Its usually more about the music and less about the hype so it doesn't have to include every huge reggae tune down the road at the time, and the newest edition, #32, is no different on those points at all.Because the album is what it is, right off the bat, you know you'll get tunes like There For You, from Vp's artist Beres Hammond, Solid as a Rock from VP artist TOK, Consuming from VP artist Capleton, Idiot Thing That from Vp artist Assassin, and I See Girls from Tanto Metro & Devonte (who just happen to be VP artists as well). None (and I mean NONE) of those tunes find the artists in their finest hour, and add to those We'll Be Burning by Sean Paul and rapper Remy Martin's remix of Lady Saw's I've Got Your Man (which is now edited).What's good about STB 32 is also what's weird about it (a twist if you will). Unbeknownst to me, suddenly Sizzla's Rise to the Occasion, the title track from a 2003 Greensleeves album has become a delayed hit and it has never sounded finer than it does with the updated heavy Nyah drum treatment it gets here. Also present here is Marijuana by Richie Spice, huge tune which gets respect on a larger label than his full album, Spice in Your Life, did last month. Also love the presence of Macka Diamond, a Greensleeves artist doing her thing (with a very Vybz Kartel sounding flow) on Done A Ready, and absolutely the Mother Marcia Griffiths on the excellent Back in the Days.The real stars of STB #32, however, are the opening 3 tunes (one of which is Sizzla's 'Rise') the other 2 consist of Bascom X's huge Lonely Girl which shows the artist stepping out of the self-imposed Kalongi shadow under which he previously recorded, the tune is amazing. Second in quality to only track one, which is probably the biggest tune in reggae in all of 2004 Can't Satisfy Her by upstart Rasta I-Wayne. The tune is a lyrically deep statement by an artist never before heard of who is now. . . you guessed it a VP artist (definitely waiting for that one debut) (sounds a lot like Warrior King a few years ago). If Can't Satisfy Her isnt the big tune here then its the sweet voiced one Cocoa Tea's Tek Weh Yu Gal, which you've probably heard before, big tune from the vet.Overall, besides the interesting nature of its makeup this one probably won't interest reggae heads, you probably have the single of every tune on here which interests you, to the newbie however, I'd definitely reccoment STB 32, as I generally would every edition in this decent series.

Musically speaking, moving back to the Caribbean was, by far, the single greatest thing I have ever done for my collection! Despite the (ODD) fact that most reggae albums aren't distributed here (due to the fact that Caribbean people notoriously avoid actually buying albums) and I still have to order most of them, I have been exposed almost weekly to new and interesting artists I either would NEVER have heard of, or would have been exposed to much time down the line living anywhere else in the world (the case is probably an infinite amount of times true in the case of soca, which I love as well). Even with the widespread new popularity and continued growth of reggae, there are still some names which DISTINCTLY and exclusively belong in the region which people outside just don't get to see unless they come for holidays. Probably the strongest regional reggae artist I've stumbled across (and I'm partial) has been St. Maarten's own (actually he's from the French side) Ambassador Junior Lion. Junior Lion (although I haven't heard anything new in a minute) is an artist who I doubt will ever make it to the more mainstream side of reggae, and that's a GOOD thing. The VERY versatile roots artist stocks vibes galore and REALLY has some of the most impressive flows in the roots landscape of anyone going these days period! If I were to even take a further outside glance, I would still even call Lion one of the best young artist in the game these days, and he is! Recently, an artist from the Bahamas, the wicked Jah Hem, has also popped up on my radars (BIG BIG tune by the name of Wickedest Time in his catalogue). Having already voiced a combination alongside legendary Jamaican roots singer Luciano, Jah Hem PROBABLY someday is headed to a modicum of stardom in the more mainstream section of reggae, however, as for now, his talents remain to be almost exclusively enjoyed in the Caribbean and the stalwart reggae heads who track down EVERYONE (of which I am also). Even more recently there's been young Revalation, a potential superstar from out of St. Thomas and of the same camp which initially bust the now ultra-popular Pressure Busspipe (as well as the very popular Cruzan singer Army), Dean Pond's Studio 340. Revalation is a fine example of the 'delayed vibes syndrome' as I've been championing the potential of the young chanter for quite awhile, the rest of the world is now just getting its initial taste of his vibes due to the release of his excellent debut album, Serious Matters. There are just so many wonderful artists which remain hidden to the rest of the world for the most part (like the wicked Isasha and Million Voice) and some of which, will always be.That certainly cannot be said about the artist in question here who I LITERALLY stumbled across under the MOST UNUSUAL set of circumstances. There was a very popular riddim in Jamaica a little while ago by the name of the 83 Riddim, produced by roots ace, Kemar `Flava' McGregor of No Doubt Records (who you know from having produced the majority of Gyptian's debut album as well as Richie Spice's current hit, Di Plane Land). The riddim had a VERY impressive tune by the name of Wake the Town sung by the soulful roots singer, Mykal Somer from out of St. Kitts. The name Mykal Somer was SO familiar to me, but I couldn't quite remember where I had heard it. After some brief research, I `discovered' that Somer had in fact not only already released his debut album, Element of Surprise in 2003, but, after some more research in my own closet, I also discovered that I ALREADY OWNED an unopened copy of said album (incidentally, its worth mentioning that the 83 Riddim also has its own album, but you won't find Wake the Town on it, as its, presumably, being kept for Somer's own album). I probably might have never checked in on Element of Surprise (especially considering I moved and packed it up and ignored it then) were it not for Wake the Town and had I not moved back, I probably wouldn't have heard the tune at all! So, having now REDISCOVERED the Kittitian singer, almost a half-decade later, I have to say that I'm impressed. Hailing form an island which (like St. Maarten) has historically been regarded as much more of a soca/calypso island, Mykal Somer is definitely the most popular artist of a burgeoning young reggae scene. Its actually been my experience with St. Kitts and Nevis that they actually do tend to push reggae nicely and most big name Jamaican reggae artists will stop there on their Caribbean tours, but as far as local talents in reggae, the list of names is generally very short, although it has been expanding over the last few years. Somer heads a pack which includes names like the wicked dancehall DJ Junior Killer (probably the best modern old-school name in the game right now and he really has some serious skill, with a faster paced version of Merciless vibes); there's also the wicked Bamboo B who has an album to his credit which is even more impressive than Element of Surprise, De Man From Zion (good luck tracking that one down); and probably most notably, there's the fire breathing very popular Ashkenaz, who is quite popular, but I'd be willing to bet that most of his fans outside of Kitts don't know exactly where he is from! Mykal Somer is, on the other had, the only PURE roots artist (Ashkenaz is somewhat, but definitely has more of a Capleton or Sizzla style of 65% roots to his 35% dancehall). He's also the only pure singer of the bunch and the one artist who took the initiative in setting up his own label, not only for himself, but for the island as well. Element of Surprise comes through his own Somer Music Group and was distributed by Eskeh (SK) Entertainment and the album was produced by Somer himself alongside (the unknown to me) Michael Fanus. Mykal Somer has yet to, at least to my knowledge, release another album since Element of Surprise, but EoS does a mighty fine job in introducing to the world one the Caribbean's most special of hidden talents.Somer's style is actually one which is a little unusual. He has much more of a modern R&B; singer's type of cadence (or maybe even a gospel singer) and tone. When you apply that to reggae music, USUALLY it comes in the form of a dancehall singer. Thus, I would say the artist Somer most reminds me of is someone like Da'Ville, but in an almost entirely roots scheme of vibes. After a brief but impressive vocal intro (which solidifies Somer`s spirituality in case you couldn't figure it out), Natty Heights, Element of Surprise begins with the tune which was apparently one of the singles and definitely one of the bigger tunes from the album, Keep On Sharing. Early in the tune, Somer utters the VERY applicable line when he says, ". . . This is a lesson that we all have to learn!". The tune speaks how important it is to not only share tangible things, but sharing things like righteousness, love and the teachings of His Majesty as well. To credit Fanus (who did the music for the album) briefly, the vibes here (and throughout the album) are top notch, particularly on the easy going but jovial Keep On Sharing. Next up is a big tune for the Empresses of the world and particularly the mothers, Mama Miga. The tune plays over a LOVELY lithe one drop as EoS continues its very nice opening. The tune speaks to not only give love, honour and respect to the Woman for what she has DONE, but what she continues to do and what she will do in the future. The most stirring vibe on the tune is that Somer appears to personalize the vibes a bit, not speaking to the mothers as a whole, but definitively speaking to his own mother, which was a very nice touch for the tune (he also employs much more of a straight forward DJ/singjay style which sounds like a less nasally version of Bermy upstart Collie Buddz, very impressive). Completing the opening for Element of Surprise is the HUGE sounding Know Your Friends. The tune implores the masses to be careful of exactly who we keep company with because as you meet and become in contact with more and more people, lines become more and more blurred and true FRIENDS can become virtually indistinguishable from true ENEMIES and, of course, seeking the guidance of The KING, can make things far more clear and easier to navigate.For roots artists, normally, the problem (or the issue) generally comes down to a matter of exactly what they can do to distinguish themselves from the pack. With most of the topics having been covered, most of the styles having already been created and PROBABLY the presence of similar artists already on the scene, building a name can be difficult. For his part, Somer doesn't struggle with that, although EoS could have used another combination or two. The one combination which is here, Time Don't Wait alongside American based Jamaican DJ, Prospec, is quite impressive. The big voiced Prospec doesn't really chime in until later in the tune and he does a fine job with his verse on a tune which reminds us that THE DAY is coming, so its wise to make the best of today on what is definitely one of the real highlights of Element of Surprise. Another highlight is the beautifully LUSH title track itself. The song is just a BIG tune (although I'm not of its far more minimalist remix) which says that the real element of surprise is the children and thus, every man and woman. Element of Surprise's most beautiful `surprise' comes in the form of the tune Got to Be Free which is downright perfect and far and away the most impressive conglomerate of vibes you'll hear on the album altogether! The tune has a wonderfully uplifting and inspirational vibes which really carry it to the head of the pack for my opinion, definitely a wonderful track and one you need to hear DEFINITELY. To find my prime choice for EoS' second strongest tune overall, you don't have to go very far from Got To Be Free at all. Check the very next track, the wonderfully done repatriation anthem, Here We Go. I MIGHT go as far to say that the tune has become lead `rival' of Sizzla's AWESOME Africa Prepare as my current favourite repatriation tune: Yes, its that good. The tune is just beautifully set and equally as beautifully vibed as Somer delivers a going home piece for the ages as he draws various brilliant connections with repatriation and his music and life in general; as he says, "Well if you're not there in Africa, then I will take you there with this song!". BIG BIG vibes. Before what becomes the literal end of Element of Surprise there is a brief string of three VERY impressive tunes. First up is the heavy and educational History which is definitely the best of the trio. History is a tune on a vibes which you've heard quite a bit before if you really listen to roots reggae (of any era), as Somer uses evidence of the past to coincide with the world today and even the future. At the tune's VOLCANIC peak, Somer offers names of the past, socially as well as musically (including Marley, Miller and Silk) as he openly ponders how the world is today and these great warriors could possibly be remembered given the state of things, which is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!. Next up is the somewhat dancehall vibed Who Is Babylon? The tune actually took a few spins to grow on me, but when it did it really opened up the vibes definitely. The tune speaks of all the things, both of the obvious and not-so-obvious things which the oppressive society has done. Definitely a track where you need to focus on the words. Lastly is the somewhat familiar vibes which is Journey. I don't REALLY think I've heard the tune before, maybe the riddim or something but it has a very familiar and comfortable vibes about it. The tune is speaks to not only Mykal Somer's own personal journey in his life, but the journey of the children of Afrika and where he is going and where WE are going, as he says, "Yes, we've reached to turn back now!". Still have a long way to go, but songs like Journey well help to put such ideas in context. The album ends with the outro, Dedication, on which Somer adds a nice touch by vocally dedicating the album to a passed friend, Agagabash.Overall, as they say, reggae time is longer than twine, thus, despite now being more than five years old, Element of Surprise still rather nicely fits in the current vibes of today. Having now seen that Somer is still at work and now, seemingly, exposing himself to a wider variety of vibes (including catching the ear of McGregor) I'm very interested to see exactly what he can do on a bigger scale. Typically, talents like Somer, which, as I mentioned, aren't typically what you'd hear in roots reggae music, tend to excel better where there is a wider variety of producers. You won't find more reggae producers in the world than in Jamaica itself, so hopefully we can expect a somewhat steady stream of singles and maybe even an album soon. As it stands, Mykal Somer is currently one of the Caribbean's best kept secrets along with a whole heap of potential big names in St. Kitts. Whether he can capitalize on this surprise and ascend to the reggae stratosphere remains to be seen. However, if Element of Surprise is any indication, he certainly comes equipped with all the talent and the vibes to do just that.

2003 was a huge year for dancehall music. Finally it attracted the type of attention that it so desperately fought for in the 10 or so years that it had taken the backseat due to the disappearance of its most recognizable international face, Shabba Ranks. One of the most serious beneficiaries of this explosion has been Elephant Man. He scored with his biggest international hit Pon Di River, and currently has loaded his Signal Di Plane set to acheive an even greater audience. Dancehall's self-proclaimed 'Energy God'has made himself known to an audience who was previously only familiar with him through his mega hit Log On making the rounds on the mix-tape circuit, two years prior.Meanwhile, back in Jamaica, a severe talent emerged that took the traditional dancehall scene by storm. This severe talent came in the form of a slight 24 year old man with a funny name. Vybz Kartel compiled a thorough number of hits and despite his recent actions (at STING) he still enthralls fans based on his ridiculous penchant for writing lyrics that capture the interests and concerns of Jamaica's youth.Not surprisingly UK reggae giant Jet Star has managed to pit the two together in the newest edition of their generally high-quality series Toe to Toe.Taking this in terms of a truly &quot;Toe to Toe&quot; sense and its a white wash, by far the better tunes are done by Kartel, Elephant Man isn't necessarily a man who likes to share the stage, and never before is it more evident here. He scores well with his hits Fan Dem Off and Escalade Bumper, both of which appear on his album (the latter in a remixed version) and his best effort on the album Somebody Wife. But the star of this show is Kartel, whose flow is just dominant on his When Bad Man Drive by, Fashionable Girl and Up 2 Di Sky. He even closes the show in a wicked combination with Frisco Kid which finds him in an unusual cultural mood. The most interesting tune from this album is done by Vybz Kartel. And when I say Vybz Kartel, I mean VYBZ KARTEL. Prior to breaking out as a solo artist Kartel was part of a group called Vybz Kartel which included himself (as Adi Banton) and 2 other members Mr. Lee and Escobar. And Weed Partner showcases Kartel with Mr. Lee absolutely killing a flow, which would later prove to be the basis for his Up to the Sky tune, not surprisingly, and correctly, Kartel assumed that not many people had heard the verse in its original form.Overall, non-veteran Elephant Man fans will probably pick this one up, but when they do, they may be shocked to find an even greater star sharing the stage with the Energy God.

Exactly how Sizzla fans waited the agonizingly long 91 days between Life and Sizzla's previous album, Stay Focus is an absolute mystery to me. How they consistently wait the 50 or so days a year between announcements of his albums is even more perplexing. . .Seriously though, as 2004 comes to an end, Sizzla celebrates the release of his 6th official release (albeit African Children and Red Alert were basically the same album), with another greatest hits album to add even more fire, you kind of start to wonder if it'll ever end. Probably not. With an artist who seems bent on writing new songs everyday and record labels who seem bent on grabbing up enough of them to make albums and fans (myself definitely included)who seem to have virtually no problem with shelling out around $70-80/year for his music, why should he ever stop? And I suppose if his next 10 years in the business prove to be as fruitful as the first decade has, he'll be well beyond a HUGE 60 studio album catalog before he turns 40!On to the music! Life is a pretty decent album. Its the definite followup to last year's Rise to the Occasion Greensleeves album, but is the literal followup to 2001's Black History album which was the last album Sizzla did which he himself was on the board for, he produces about 75% of Life and the results are mixed to say the least. This is by no means the artist's best (that seems to be reserved for Bobby Digital and Occasionally his producer Fattis Burrel) material, but its serviceable and if 'Rise' could do as good as it ended up doing, I don't see any difference with this one. The best tune here is Mortal Man featuring Thriller U (who I would definitely like to see in the studio more), also like Marijuana, Things Will Be Better, Haven't I Told You (aka For You) riding the massive I Swear riddim, We Got the Love and the really really good Jah Works oh and Jah Love too. Basically the first half of the album is really really good. The second half is pretty weird, the title track starts good but gets really crazy really quick. (Oh and for a second half good tune, has to be Born & Raised)Overall, if you've been listening to this artist for awhile, you'll find some great vibes here and nothing that will shock you on the downside. Its pretty much what you've come to expect from Sizzla in the most recent years, notable spans of brilliance on one side and a virtual experiment on the other. All in all its still pretty good and will probably please much of the crowd which liked the suprisingly critically acclaimed 'Rise'. See you next fall for the next Greensleeves album, next summer for the VP album and in. . . about What? a couple of months maybe? for the next Jetstar album. . .

I'm not much of a dan of Kiprich's. The rather nasally voiced, whiny dj has always been the epitome of 'average' in the dancehall for me and his talents, in my opinion, have been best used as a sidekick to Elephant Man. I really honestly only bought this album because of the pretty girl that insisted that I buy it. But, you wake up one day and notice that reggae-giant VP Records has signed up Elly's sidekick for an album or two.Why? I wouldn't at all be surprised it Elephant himself (a VP artist) had something to do with it, but also due to Kip's own merits, as 2005 saw the release of arguably his biggest solo hit to date, Telephone Ting.Kiprich comes off as (and looks like) a big kid, and on his debut album, Outta Road, it seems as if he's having a ton of fun. He answers his own hit, Telephone Ting (instead of waiting for Gabriel to do it), on which he tells his woman that she has nothing to worry about, with The Letter on which he sits down and writes letters to all the other women in his life whom he can no longer called because his woman destroyed his cellphone. A truly hilarious turn, reminscent of King Yellow's I'm Getting Divorced, an immeditae answer to his own hit, I'm getting Married.Also check the anti-drug We Nah Go, which finds Kippo sounding very unlike himself; the straight Macka Diamond aimed Gimme Back which is hilarious from the notoriously cheap Kiprich; check the ultra bubbly T-Spot and the cool Liquor.All that being said, the single best tune on Outta Road is easily the hilarious Baby Song on the massive Military riddim. Baby Song goes about identifying certain characteristics by which you might be able to spot on missing children. "If yu see a baby, when him see Ninjaman him start kicking: Kartel baby. . . If yu see a baby, kinda ugly and a climb out him crib: Elephant baby. . . If yu see a baby, just born and a bawl fi money: Macka Diamond baby. . . If yu see a baby, you give him money and him nah waan spend it: dat a fi mi baby". The song is funny throughout as Kip tackles nearly all of reggae's modern royalty including Beenie, Bounty, Sizzla & Capleton.Overall, perhaps most interesting here is that for an artist best known for his combination tunes, Kiprich offers enough vibes to carry Outta Road completely by himself. There is not one combination. Kip rides Big Yard's riddims very finely and shows his lyricism to be of a better quality than I originally thought. So, I'll swallow a swig of my pride and admit that although he is whiny (and I'll stand by that!) maybe, just maybe Kiprich's having a career isn't a sign of the inevitable coming of the end of the freeworld and maybe he is pretty good at this whole dancehall thing.

I almost feel timid in writing a review for a relatively current Gregory Isaacs album. Knowing what the man is in reggae music, what he has stood for over the years and what he has meant to the music overall, its impossible for me to give a completely impartial run of his most recent studio album, Masterclass (unbelievably recorded for Greensleeves Records).The first thing you, as a fan of Isaacs, will undoubtedly notice is the apparent deterioration of his legendary voice. Dont get me wrong, he still sings a reggae tune better than 9 out of 10 singers ever will but his beautiful fragile tones which once told everyone about his Night Nurse have taken a slight dip for the Masterclass. What is most impressive, however, about this album is that he can still put together one curiously perfect love/jilted lover songs seemingly at whim. And with the unknown (to me) Steve Martin on the board, many of these songs surprisingly work completely well on Masterclass.My choice for the best of the album is without a doubt the opener Secret Love Affair which perhaps best utilizes the backup singer. That's another story on this one the female backup singing on Masterclass is. . . a masterclass, featured are veterans such as King of Kings vet Heather Cummings and Leba Hibbert. Also worth checking on the album is the beautiful old sounding Lonely Street (again featuring awesome backing by Ms Cummings), expectedly an ode to Isaacs old friend Dennis Brown, a fantastic version of Stay at Home and the 'cute' 15 Minutes Ago.15 Minutes Ago is one of the more interesting songs here. Listening to it, perhaps more than any of the other 13 tracks, it shows the deterioration in Isaacs voice, but it also shows what he's learned after all these years that he doesn't have to completely blow the candles out to still make a wish. His experience alone makes the song very very good. Hungry for Your Love and the albums 2nd best tune, Wanted List round out this decent album.Overall, there will always be space in my cd player for a Gregory Isaacs album as long as he is making music. And with the current trend in reggae music being what it is more and more recycling of older riddims, he just might have added more and more years to his career in terms of being more and more relevant to a younger audience. I would absolutely love to see what Isaacs could do on some of the bigger and better sets these days. His day, however, has come and gone, but every few years or so, he'll come back and remind everyone EXACTLY how it used to be.

What a difference a year can make! On the 2003 version of The Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems, there were no less than 8 tracks which featured then recently departed Greensleeves artist Elephant Man. This year, with Ele a full album and year and a half into his VP/Atlantic contract, the artist who is most likely to appear on any dancehall compilation these days appears on just one song out of the 40, the very average Get On Up and Dance.Elephant Man is replaced by the new big man at Greensleeves Vybz Kartel(who himself appeared on 8 tracks in 2003)who, effectively, carries the 2004 Anthem album. Generally if you buy one hardcore dancehall compilation a year, it should be this one, in it's massive 40 track stature and single disc price, its certainly something nearly everyone can find enjoyable.The best tunes here are undoubtedly somewhere in the 11! on which Kartel appears, with the absolute best being perhaps the lyrically insane It Tight, the flow is absolutely insane on that, also love Push It to You and Phone Call with Bling Dawg which finds Bling Dawg in perhaps the best form I've ever heard from him as he approaches the release of his debut album early in 2005. Besides Kartel, the best consists of Ce'cile's controversial Do It to Me, Beenie Man's Freakside, Mr Easy's Pull Up and upstart [...] impressive Girls Gone Wild.Another thing really interesting about 2004's edition is where it improves upon 2003's edition: There are several tracks which are by women here as opposed to not one out of 40 from 2003. Recent Greensleeves signee Macka Diamond puts in great work on seevral tunes, the best of which being the hilarious Try Wid Him. There are also sprinkeled in some annoying dance tracks, which do you no good if you don't know the dances.Overall, I don't know if I could ever give an Anthem album a 5star review because its just so much material and far too much for everyone differently to be close to perfect. However, 2004 just like every year gives an overpowering enough for everyone and surely if you love dancehall music, you can find something here that will get stuck in your head.

Take out the skits and its one of the greatest dancehall records ever. This is the type of album that gets hip hop fans into reggae. Deport Them is excellent, so is Check it Deeply, both the songs with Mr. Vegas, and Infiltrate on that Who Am I? rhythm. Alos listen to Faded. That being said the best song outside of Deport Them on the record is No Bligh, which is straight head rockin dancehall, if you like music get it. I like it so much i bought it twice.

This is an easy one. Reggae Max is basically an underground greatest hits style album. It has some songs on it that I've never knew existed (i.e. Pressure), but it has some big sounds on it as well. First of all, its pretty hard to give any album that has the studio version of Black Woman &amp; Child on it, flat out one of the greatest songs ever made, barnone. It also has Holding Firm, Babylon a Listen, Babylon Cowboy and Do Some Good, all smashes. Then you get to the big underground cuts like the lyrically excellent Explain to the Almighty, True God and Love is Amongst my Brethrn. Because Black Woman &amp; Child is on the album, its pretty clear what the best song is here, but the second best is the hip-hop inspired Who is Laughing with, ubelievably, Ninja Man. The pairing is very unique, and Sizzla and Ninja Man pull it off amazingly. (also you can clearly see Sizzla's overall abilities, as his lyrics toy with a riddim that a legend in Ninja Man has a little trouble in riding.Overall, Sizzla has another greatest hits album (with One Away on it) coming out next week, but, if you're not planning on buying that one, or if you're like me, and you buy anything with Sizzla's name on it, then by all means pick this one up, and if you've heard alot about Sizzla, but never heard him actually, this might be one of the better places to start.

(3.5stars)Perhaps the day is quickly approaching when all fans of dancehall music (and reggae in general for that matter) may want to start learning French (and Creole) in order to be able to appreciate some of the strong vibes coming from France and the French West Indies. I myself, am currently attempting to do the same (under the watchful eye of my wife) because the ridiculously high level of POLISHED vibes just got too big to ignore when artists of all varieties continue to emerge on the Francophonic side. Now, nearly two years into it, I'm picking up artists who are definitely pushing huge vibes (despite the fact that my French is still very bad) and telling just about everyone who will listen. The first artist who really caught my attention was Martiniquian Sael, the young artist, who has a decidedly more rootical twist when at his best, served as a gateway to me learning about other artists (I actually started the language to be able to decipher what Sael was saying in his songs with his vibes definitely being that strong in order to transcend the language). Since then I've `discovered' names such as the insanely wicked Admiral T and (English speaking West African) Lyricson. However, the last year has been quite an educational process for me in learning about the likes of Tiwony, Fefe Typical, Daddy Mory, Straika D, Admiral T prot&eacute;g&eacute;s Sam X and the fire breathing Sak, L'Homme Paille and most recently, the very solid and fun Lady Sweety alongside countless others (i.e. Little Espion, Mighty Ki La, Daly and reggae/zouk songbird Kenedy). The thing that undoubtedly attracted me (and continues to attract me) initially, was the virtual identical landscape to the Jamaican music scene which was exhibited by France and the FWI. Meaning while most other reggae producing places in the world show themselves to specialize in one area of the music (such as how in the UK they tend to focus more on updating the classic vibes and in St. Croix and the extended Virgin Islands, they focus much more on modern roots), France and the FWI will focus on everything: On one side there is Tiwony, Lyricson and Sael pushing vibes which sound almost identical to the Sizzla's, Capleton's and Anthony B's of the world; while on the other, there is Admiral T, Daly and Mighty Ki La pushing a vibe which absolutely echoes that of the Beenie Man's, Bounty Killa's and Vybz Kartel of here in Jamaica. Yet still is more talent. Just as the likes of Aidonia, Busy Signal and Bramma alongside dozens of others showing up almost weekly to refill the ranks in Jamaica, the FWI boasts names such as the wicked and pounding Saik, the almost robotically aggressive Sam X and without a doubt the most popular and polished young artist of them all, Krys.I actually learned of the young Guadeloupe native not too far after from when I learned of Admiral T (actually when I began to really study up on Admiral T, I had saw a performance of the Guadeloupean lyrics machine awhile before I actually knew who he was) as the two in terms of popularity seemingly run very close as the two most popular artists in the scope of Guadeloupe and the FWI. Admiral T himself is a very interesting artist, characterized by his ability to go off on seemingly never-ending tongue twisting barrages of downright lethal lyrics (imagine a more well humoured and slightly more hype French version of Vybz Kartel) where Krys is a much more polished and hype style of young artist who definitely takes more of vibes to the `dance' side of dancehall (although long from there now, someday young Krys will definitely be a French version of dancehall ace Beenie Man) although seemingly his concentration will definitely lead him to a much more broad span of lyrics (but then again, my French may be so bad that he might already be at that point) (incidentally, should you find yourself looking for a French version of Elephant Man, check the downright odd L`Homme Paille and his straw hat). While Admiral T has definitely been THE name in French speaking dancehall over the last decade (and the one who gets the most respect in the rest of the reggae world, currently he is bringing new artists such as Saik and Sam X as well), without a doubt the one stapled for the future is Krys. Thus, when thinking about an artist to begin with in exploring the French vibes, definitely I would recommend Krys as a fine starting point. Krys has also began to start a slow expansion of his music, currently he is riding high with the tune Hustla which features Jamaican dancehall stars Vybz Kartel and Aidonia. To date, in his career Krys has three albums to his name, the first of which reached as a predominately Guadeloupe based project, the very popular Lime Mic La from 2004 which featured two of his early and biggest tunes to date both V.I.P. as well as the pure soca knocker Big Tune Du Carnival. The album as whole, was very solid, despite checking in with just ten tracks in total. The album helped launch him to a stage where he could release his debut in the big time, this release, cleverly titled K-Rysmatik. Checking in at a VERY full eighteen tracks, K-Rysmatik is definitely an album which afforded the young artist the most opportunity to showcase his still developing skills and in the meantime score with a few big tunes. The album was a VERY big deal as it was actually released on a major label in Universal, promoted very well and ultimately a commercial success for Krys. It is also a big reason why the artist is relevant to audiences outside of just the French speaking market as it showed that he is amongst a surging group of artists in the world now, a pure dancehall artist with the vibes to carry an entire album (and believe me when I say that, although the group is getting stronger, for the past few years, the number of artists who could claim that has been VERY slim). Krys' `third' album was a ten track street release, the beautifully pounding Renaissance in 2007.Of the three, it was Renaissance which definitely showed the now twenty-four years old Krys in his best light and pushed his music the most. However, given its size, its also the piece which has opened the young artist up to most (some undeserved and some LARGELY deserved) criticism as many point to K-Rysmatik as showing Krys' lack of depth (although, given his age, I'll give him some pass on that, won't on the next album however). K-Rysmatik opens up with boastful, but forgivable K-R-Y-S. I would think that the first tune is the exact point where you would think about putting (on an album such as this) one of the most fun tunes forward, and although KRYS is far from a big one drop, it doesn't serve that purpose quite exactly (the second tune here does, however). Still, built over a VERY big and bouncy riddim which has a ton of twists in turns in its 3:37, KRYS does introduce the listener to. . .Krys in a fairly big way on the straight forward dancehall track. The real fun on K-Rysmatik, however, gets started with the second tune and one of the biggest on the album, Hold Up Lyrical. If you didn't have a big jump up time with KRYS, certainly that's delivered on the second as Hold Up Lyrical comes across in its vibes as exactly what it is lyrically. The song is, more or less, a tune which gives big respect to dancehall as a whole (and of course Krys' own place in it) and maintains a very hard and pounding vibes throughout. The song also, on the lyrical side, gives a SLIGHT variation as he urges people to get into the dancehall and hold up a woman, instead up holding a gun. And definitely check the spot near the middle of the track, where he absolutely LOCKS OFF the flow an moves it for a while on a sick vibes! Completing the ultra hype opening of K-Rysmatik is the entirely more playful Hey Selecta. I would have probably preferred a nice one drop (ANYWHERE) at this point on the album, but Hey Selecta doesn't exactly disappoint as it doesn't DIRECTLY follow in the line of the first two tunes. The vibe on the tune is far more playful and although hype still, is still a respectable changeup, if ever so slightly (before again turning it way back up with Caroline), with Hey Selecta, the first tune on K-Rysmatik in Creole.The biggest hit tune to come from K-Rysmatik was definitely Dangereuse (Hazardous), which has also proven to be one of Krys' biggest hits overall to date. The song very much so follows in the line of the opening two tracks (which becomes a point of concern through eighteen tracks) being very big and heavy, spectacular sounding dancehall, however it is CLEARLY a standout amongst the rest on that same vibes. The song which is by far the biggest tune Krys offers on his favourite subject (WOMEN), attracted quite a bit of attention for the young artist on its own and is downright addictive! Again, it has also been the doorway through which Krys has drawn criticism, but if you make songs which sound like this and seemingly don't obtrusively go out of its way to be harmful, you won't hear complaint number one from me.Besides Dangereuse, the TRULY most interesting development on K-Rysmatik is its various turns and twists. With the majority (lets say, ~85%) of the album being the hard pounding dancehall style of Dangereuse and the openers, it almost leaves you BEGGING for a changeup or two. There are two different styles of NATURAL changeups for dancehall artists, the rootical track and the soca track. Of course Krys prefers option C, however. Check Avec Le Temps (Over Time) which introduces Krys' option. Being from Guadeloupe, Krys is definitely familiar and accustomed to the vibes of Zouk. Zouk is a form of music which is basically a SHOCKINGLY beautiful Creole take on R&B.; The songs are very beautiful and almost aura sounding and just downright sweet to the ears. Krys favours Zouk over more traditional one-drop style of reggae on K-Rysmatik. Avec Le Temps is the artist's well done solo attempt, but on Ka Fe Fwet (It Is Cold) he enlists the help of Martinique zouk Empress, Princess Lover. The song is far and away the most lovely thing you'll hear on K-Rysmatik, and something he should definitely think of trying in the future (perhaps next time with Kenedy). It is another combination in the area, however, that scores that absolute biggest shot on K-Rysmatik for me. Myself being COMPLETELY partial (I've been listening to soca nonstop for about two months now) absolutely loved the one soca tune here, Mad, a combination with St. Vincent soca ace Problem Child. Previously, Krys rode VERY high with the soca tune, Big Tune Du Carnaval and he has shown great ability on the vibes. Mad is just what the title implies and it goes even beyond the big hi-tech dancehall with which he is so familiar and he more than holds his own with the St. Vincy `party animal' hit-maker. Definitely check out Mad. A later changeup, the very odd Robey E Charlotte, seems stuck between zouk, calypso and even salsa, and Krys shows off a singing style which fails to impress. Also check Pardonne-Leur (Forgive Them), one of the two times he comes CLOSE (the other being the very solid closer Neg) to a straight reggae vibe. The song actually finds young Krys giving the more straight rootical vibes, espousing on the troubles of the governing bodies of the world. It is the type of song you hope a young artist can have in their bag of tricks, Krys clearly shows he does and would be wise to develop the style in particular in the future, giving himself an even broader range of subject matter to discuss.Unfortunately, much of the balance of K-Rysmatik is songs which flow ore in the heavier dancehall vibes but fail to come close to toppling Dangereuse. Arno does recapture the more clever and subtle vibes of Hey Selecta, but not to the exact proficiency; while Tenue Correcte Exig&eacute;e (Correct Maintenance Required) is just an entirely good time, definite dance floor piece there.Overall, with the artist in question here, Krys, being so young, K-Rysmatik, if a very full strong effort, but I get the feeling that definitely more COULD have been done (in a few years` time, with someone of Krys' overall abilities, I would expect him to ridiculously outshine this album) in the eighteen tracks. Without a doubt, someone needs to pass Krys or his managers the contact info to legendary JA producer Dean Fraser (or even the entirely more logistically possible France based Bost & Bim of Special Delivery) to give him a more developed rootical edge which he so wonderfully displays on Pardonne-Leur (WOULD love to see a combination with Tiwony or Lyricson in the future) . But, such things generally come in time to the most gifted. Krys is amongst the `most gifted' K-Rysmatik is the best display of his talents, this is recommended to all fans of French dancehall, but especially the newer ones. Through so much of the big dancehall vibe gets overbearing at times, but definitely I look forward to seeing what young Krys comes up with when he tightens everything up. One day, he could be king.

Were Anthony B.'s outstanding career to end tomorrow, and he remain deprived of the madness of attention levels that his more visable bredrin receieve (Sizzla & Capleton), Real Revolutionary is the piece that he would be able to hang his turban on when the sun sets.Without so much as a hint of exaggeration, Real Revolutionary, the artist's debut from 1996 (re-released in '98) is one of the best modern reggae pieces you'll EVER hear. From beginning to end you get a complete taste of the first few tunes that went to establish the Ashanti chanter in JA and in foreign.After the brief intro, B's finest moment begins the album. The controversial Fire Pon Rome which made the artist the talk of the town in 96-97 as he burned a hole in all things oppressive, on a tune which is quite underrated musically. Many remember the lyrics of course, but the slow nyah influenced Star Trail riddim is just about as crucial as the lyrics themselves.Take the first track for what it is, its still the best tune he's ever recorded to date, and add in the rest. The result is an almost embarrasment of riches. Swarm Me, Raid Di Barn, Cold Feet, So Many Things, Hurt di Heart, Bun Down Sodom, do I need keep going? Real Revoluionary is MASSIVE and it made waves for the artist that fans are still feeling to slashes from nearly a decade later.Real Revolutionary fits quite well when stacked against albums such as 'Til Shiloh, Black Woman & Child, One Way Ticket and More Fire as yet another potential pillar of the category of modern roots reggae.Overall, I mean, sure, I could go down the list and tell you about this track or that one, but its really not necessary or applicable in this situation. Real Revolutionary is pretty much mandatory. As I first noticed the tracklist, I thought to myself: This would be the set list I hope that he would choose this setlist for a concert of his that I might attend. Yes you need this album, you should actually have it already. Its that good.

I always get in a better mood to write a soca review. And although the music shelves aren't exactly saturated in what is unarguably the most fun musical style ever created, VP Records has shown a nice nice penchant for pushing the music moreso than any other large label. Between the Soca Gold anually wicked compilation, the D'Soca Zone compilations and releasing albums from artist's like Edwin Yearwood, Bunji Garlin and 3Suns all within the last 3-5 years, they've done well (although signing Destra might be a pretty good idea in 2007!) promoting soca.One of these promotions is the annual winter/fall release of D'Soca Zone compilation. The DSZ compilation is very similar to the Soca Gold compilation, its almost like SG jr. in that it mainly draws from more recent tunes and generally not looking for the biggest names (although the bigger names always are present).This year is no different. But I'm mighty glad to see this album and my anticipation for it was well rewarded, in the few years I've been listening to this one, the 7th Flag Up is definitely the best of the bunch! This album has a few songs from a few artists whom I've never heard of that had me wayyyyy more than impressed, and some songs from artists that I may have heard of, but not too familiar with, that just blew me away!Case and point: Although I am slightly familiar with Red Hot Flames, I had never heard Quad Ride and the song is MASSIVE! Its that never let you stop jumping from the start style soca which I absolutely love. But on the flip side, of course I'm familiar with poster boy Kevin Lyttle and Edwin Yearwood and just like on the 6th Flag Lyttle offers a nice shot with his My Girl just a lovely lovely song and Yearwood and Krosfyah score nicely with the opener Hott Spott as well as on the combination with reigning Monarch, Shurwayne Winchester on the even nicer We Ready to Go, and wherever they going, I'm going too! Big track!Also check Skarpyon, another unknown to me, on the wonderful Turn the Lights Down Low, not at all derivative of the Marley song of the same name, but a mighty strong track. Add Vertex to that list of unfamiliar talents to me but their Trouble is a might powerful track as well.All that being said, one of my favourite tracks on the 7th Flag Up is probably Jamesy P. and the aforementioned Skarpyon on the MASSIVE Leave Me Alone, the St. Vincy natives are well represented here (and throughout with Lyttle, and Mystik Vibration as well). Leave Me Alone is the more laid back style of soca, however on a recent trip to Tortola I had the song drummed into my brain, AND I LOVE IT! And it's only topped by my favourite track on the 7th Flag Up which is Expose by El-A-Kru! I loooooooooooooooove that song! Big, vibrant and beautiful soca, song just has you moving for days, and I'm partial because I favour the female voice in my soca, but Expose is AMAZING!Also worth hearing is Mystik Vibration's nice I Like It, and I have to mention Flames by Jabae which is the song that prevented me from listening to the remaining 75% of the album because it had me stuck there for several hours! The package also comes with a mix cd that was the style of a lot of the SG albums and it's still somewhat useful here as well.Overall, of course giving this one a seal of recommendation! I always love this album and its pretty much to tide the fans over, to keep strong soca music in the mainstream for those who can't get to all the fetes still keeping this time of year warm throughout the West In. Pick up D'Soca Zone:7th Flag Up and tell em Bramoi sent you!p.s. I would have just loved if they could've somehow squeezed my new favourite soca tune My Car Brek Down by Contone in here! But love it still!

The Sidewalk University is the latest in a long line of excellent riddims from the King Jammy's camp. This time it comes from Jammy's son Jam2 who has in the past dropped some excellent material, including the Cookie Monster, the Beat Box, the resurrection of the Duck riddims and the gorgeous Amharic. He also did much of the production work for Vybz Kartel's underground hit album, Timeless in 2004. The Sidewalk University is his latest project and he may have outdone each and everyone of his previous efforts with this MASSIVE riddim. One of the finest and most powerful of all 2006!This Sidewalk University has an old school appeal to it. You listen to it and get vibes circa 1993 and I start looking around for names like Papa San and Zebra. But it is created for today's era of dancehall and the end result is somewhat of a Ward 21-ish sounding riddim which seeks to hit you as hard as it possibly can. And although it never changes, not once in the duration of its 15 tracks (something I look for in riddim albums), if you are truly a fan of dancehall music, I doubt you'll mind very much.And some OUTSTANDING artists and vibes are lined up for the riddim with a nice wide variety of artists who put some of their best material forth for the Sidewalk University riddim. Check Assassin's Move & Gweh, as he makes some of the best usage of the SU which was absolutely built for an artist like himself with such outstanding and straight forward flows. You also have to make note that Baby Cham's MASSIVE Rudebwoy Pledge was originally built over the SU riddim before Dave Kelly built the Stage Show riddim; You also have a nice combination between Sean Paul and Wyclef Jean on Nah Watch as well Ele's hit, the hilarious Broke Back Mountain and of course Natural Black also voices on the riddim as well on his solid effort, Never. . .Of course you wouldn't know any of that looking at the lineup on this album, because none of those tracks are on here.In one of the oddest case of "what happened to?" I've ever seen in reggae nearly a quarter and most of the big tunes voiced on the Sidewalk University, for whatever reason, are not on the album for the riddim. In some cases I imagine it was because of time reasons (which could have easily been solved, would it kill dancehall fans to delay this one a few weeks?) or maybe even licensing issues (Ele, Natural Black and Baby Cham all have deals with labels that are not VP and either have recent projects out or are working on projects in Ele's case). Whatever the reason VP has done a bit of a disservice by not, in some way getting these tunes on the album.But that's to no fault of the producer and the tunes available on the album, although limited still provide a healthy dosage of vibes for those picking this one up. The best, and perhaps biggest, tune on the album is without a doubt Vybz Kartel's somewhat corny and comical Beyonce Wine, but I DARE YOU to listen to the track without moving a muscle. Beyonce Wine was created for the dancefloor without a doubt and it does more than its job! The tune is massive!You also need check the Empress' Suddenly on which Lady Saw probably goes full singing for the first time in my memory (other than that country song which she loves to do every once in a while), very nice track on her man's riddim. Up and coming Perfect on his Junjo Claat. Perfect has an unusual style which allows him to make hits out of songs like Handcart Bwoy, yet at the same time his style is probably even more suited to the hard hard dancehall riddims like the Sidewalk University (but dont tell him I said that, I like the one-drop stuff better); and of course look up Mr Peppa continuing his rise to power on his badman anthem Bully. Peppa is getting to the point of being so consistent now that you almost know that his tune on any riddim will be amongst the finest on the riddim altogether. And I'll mention that Jam2 even tapped his younger brother (and co-producer) who voice together on Dem Can't Mek Me, Baby G is really developing into a fine dj, even after becoming an already established producer.The 2 other really big tunes on the album come from veterans. Jammy's 'unofficial' children Ward 21 go about redeeming themselves for their recent HORRIBLE album King of the World on their excellent Gully Gun which sounds like good Ward 21, from the days of Mentally Disturbed. A little loony, dark and murky describes that almost classic sound. Then you check Sizzla Kalonji's Ghetto Youths. Ghetto Youths is the second to last track here and the last tune voiced and it puts an excellent ribbon the album and the tune is so big I'm actually calling it the 2nd best on the album (3rd best on the entire riddim after Kartel and 'Sassin). And the end is a clean version of the SU riddim which is always nice to see.Overall, I don't know if I'm able to recommend this one because of what's missing. Make it no fault at all to the producer Jam2 who has built an EXCELLENT riddim which is virtually flawless (besides there being not enough singers). VP should have found a way to include the missing songs on the album, or save it for another day. If they would've done that, well this one might be pushing 5stars. Because they didn't, you might wan to trod the mixtape circuit for all the tunes instead.

2003 was undoubtedly the year of Turbulence on the reggae album circuit, releasing a full 5 albums (alongside Hail to the King, there was The Truth, The Future, Different Thing and his best work Join Us)mimicking his idol and stablemate Sizzla Kalonji's style (who himself released 4 albums in the same time), Hail to the King is the ribbon on Turbulence's 2003.As to where this album fits in this year, I would put it 3rd behind the stunning Join Us and The Future albums, being a VP project however it is probably his biggest project and the most awaited of the year.The album is of course a good piece, Turbulence just doesn't make bad music, and when you combine him with his Legendary in-house producer Fattis Burrell, the quality you get is even higher. Honestly were I to pick a single best song I would probably say the (3:44 long) intro Hail to the King. Made familiar by Turbulence as he uses it to open his stage shows all over the world and its probably his best vocal performance to date (until the final note). After that you have the excellent Confession (on which he sounds a lot like Kalonji in both voice and pattern), We Deserve, Good Draw (oustanding)and Live and Let Live are all standout tracks. Also check the album's second best offering Rasta Fiesta, a completely wicked combination with unheralded stablemate Chezidek, and the album's closing track Dig It Out. The negatives? As I said there are no bad tracks, but you can continuously see the soon to be 24 year old (Jan/'04) Turbulence sometimes shows his humor at inopportune moments (like on the Future album) on tunes like Your Papito, R.E.S.P.E.C.T. and Let's Get It On Tonight (which is one of the album's best tunes but actually employs the word bl@#job in the chorus). But that will come with time as it has for so many of his predeccessors (i.e. Kalonji and Buju)Overall, with a heritage like Turbulence has: Musical family, nephew of underrated and underappreciated roots artist Norris Man, the serious class around which he is surrounded (Fattis, Kalonji and the entire Xterminator camp) Turbulence can't help but succeed due, in large part as well, to his own talents. Hail to the King is an excellent contemporary roots Rastafarian artist in the process of establishing a legend.

The first single off of this one is We're Calling You, and its an amazing record, but the rest of the album backs it up beautifully as well. With the absolute highest point here being We're Calling You, other high points are Nursery Rhymes which goes into, &quot;Hush little baby don't say a word, silk is gonna buy you a mockingbird&quot;, which caught my attention. And Treated Like a Lady. Also, check Afterplay and Don't Go with Toni's little sister Tamar Braxton who unexpectantly holds her own with Silk's amazing vocals, she gives it a great shot, the end result is a great cut. Overall, the only problem with this album is that it needs more songs, but after the monster that was Tonight 10 songs with 3 interludes is probably acceptable. For any true fan of rhythm and blues, this is truly one of the first must have releases of 2001.

Although the reggae/dancehall business is without a doubt one of the most fickle and ever-changing which you'll find in all of music, it can also be a VERY forgiving and non-forgetting one. Perhaps even more so than its musical `cousins' hip-hop and soca, both of which similarly hold a special place for artists from all era's of the music, dancehall takes it to an even further degree in that an artist can virtually vanish, for one reason or another, and seemingly comeback and not only make an appearance or two, but virtually retake the role which they once occupied. By far the best example of this over the past decade or two has been by Brother Desmond Ballantine, better known as lethal dancehall DJ, Ninja Man. The Ninja has had more lives in the dancehall that probably the entire genre, which is quite `up and down' itself (as he says, only a ninja can kill a ninja and besides himself, there just isn't another Ninja who doesn't at least on some level owe their successes to the original Ninja Man, in the dancehall). Who could have possibly predicted that during the few years when Shabba Ranking was ruling the dance with an iron fist, that some day, the oft-troubled and inactive Ninja would in the not too very distant future grow to be a name which on Jamaica, at this point might even outshine that of his longtime superstar rival. Besides the Ninja, there are many stories of artists reaching a point in there lives, for one reason or another where being active in the studio became impossible for an extended period of time (I.e. because of an injury, incarceration, just flat out lack of motivation or some other reason, besides the fact that a particular artist has just naturally reached the end of his/her career, and chooses not to record anymore). Names such as Tiger, Shabba Ranks himself and of course most recently Jah Cure to come to mind when thinking of artists who, for one reason or another, have found themselves away from the reggae spotlight for an extended period of time, only (at least attempt) to make a successful comeback. On a far smaller scale than any of those artist, is Courtney Melody. Having virtually spent the entire decade of the 1990's absolutely nowhere to be found on the music scene recovering from a nearly lethal motorbike crash, Courtney Melody adds his name to the ever growing lists of artists who just cannot leave the dancehall. In his case, unlike many of his peers, however, it is completely a good thing, both for himself, and for dancehall.Courtney Melody has always held a fairly unusual space in dancehall for me. First and foremost, rare is it that a dancehall singer has such a long career as he has had and not be more well known as he is. Melody, unlike his peers in Sanchez, Wayne Wonder, and even Admiral Tibett has yet to, at any stage of his career, make himself a powerful voice outside of Jamaica. However, of the singers I just mentioned, none can claim (with the possible exception of Sanchez whose fan base in the Caribbean outside of Jamaica has been historically known to be quite vociferous in trumpeting the brilliance of their artist) to have as hardcore of a dancehall fan base as Melody, it is not uncommon at all for fans of Courtney Melody to flat out claim him to be THE greatest dancehall artist who has EVER walked the planet! While my overall enjoyment in the singer has not gone that far as of yet, I will say that despite what you may ever hear about Courtney Melody (the singer has had in the past a reputation for having a very quick temper and for being a bit of a showman/amateur stuntman), that he is amongst a very select group of people who were absolutely BORN for the dancehall. Inasmuch as dancehall is synonymous with Jamaica, and particularly the ghettos of Jamaica and the life, rare is the artist who has a greater vibe or purpose in the dance than Courtney Melody (even his NAME oozes DANCEHALL, the name `Courtney Melody` could belong to no other entertainer besides a dancehall singer). Melody is also quite interesting (and this leads us up to today) because he has a quietly unique voice for dancehall music. He never had the big sound of a Sanchez nor the ultra-smooth vibes of Wayne Wonder or Admiral Tibet. Instead, Courtney Melody's vibes come from a voice which can range from high to low and is probably at its greatest sound when he approaches a near yell, but somehow, someway, he always makes it work. I personally have always felt that he might take a shot at the rootical side of things and have a great bit of success as the variety in which he voices is often more appreciated on the slower, rootical vibes style. Low and behold, it is 2007 and presenting to the world what can be called his complete roots debut (although there is a bit of dancehall thrown in), is Courtney Melody, with Serious Business. It is perhaps most interesting in Serious Business that in his re-arrival on the scene Melody taps Jahmikes with which he had the undeniable number one hit of his career, Modern Girl. Modern Girl is not only regarded as oen of the greatest tunes in the history of dancehall music, but if you were to list the greatest dancehall albums of all time, the album which was spawned by the track (of the same title) would have to rank quite highly on the list of any fair minded individual. The track was MASSIVE! And, again, while it never gave the singer the big international attention of some his peers, it established the name Courtney Melody as one of the most respected and most talented singers in the rather brief history of the dance. Modern Girl was not the only track for which Melody is remembered, there were also big tunes such as Try Jah Love, and of course Protection with the aforementioned Ninja Man (and you can yank just about any track from the Modern Girl album, it was such a strong piece, with my personal favourite being Down in the Dancehall). Now, Melody, reunites with the producer who manned the boards for that album, to once again bring a VERY strong vibes with Serious Business, on a rootical side.I couldn't very well tell you what number album this is from Melody as whenever I think of exactly how many he has had and come to a conclusion as to such, my subsequent research reveals that there is another (or another two) that I either forgot, or just flat out didn't know about. And while I am inclined to call Serious Business his sixth release, the truth may actually be far closer (and may actually exceed) to ten. Nevertheless what is (fairly) certain is that Serious Business is Melody's first album since 1999's Mr. Melody for JetStar (which was re-released in January). Serious Business was produced by Jahmkes for his very own NJ based Reggae Vibes label and is distributed by Fractal Entertainment out of New York. While both singer and producer have roots in the dance, the album figured to be quite solid in a roots vibes as since the duo first hooked up, Jahmikes has gone on to produce the majority of the brilliant Many More Roads by Ky-mani Marley which was nominated for an American Grammy, also, his label has released Unlimited, another strong roots piece from chanter Jah Mason (more on Mason in a minute). Serious Business begins with the very solid Gideon Soldier which gets the album started on such a nice piece and makes fans aware exactly the direction which the album is going in immediately. The very nice and LUSH instrumentation on Gideon Soldier compliment Melody's vocals lovely, and really I hope that the song gets rinsed very nicely through the mixtape/compilation circuit as it fits in very nicely with the current vibes now and could be quite popular for the singer. Easily one of the biggest tunes on the album (I'm actually calling it the second or third best tune here overall) and definitely a track which Melody fans will enjoy. Gideon Soldier is followed by Just Like the Rain which shows that Melody hasn't exactly forgotten where it all began for himself. On the album, you won't find nary a hardcore dancehall track, instead, you'll find wonderfully done lover's tracks which could ram a dance floor just as easily (or probably even easier, when you consider exactly what type of dancing is done on a lover's track). Just Like the Rain is the first of these tracks and one of the most impressive . Gifted with one of the best one-drops on the entire album, the song has not only a lover's rock feel, but a slight roots tinge as well and it makes the tune PERFECT, not only for the album, but for Courtney Melody himself at this point of his career. The high quality title track completes the very solid opening for Serious Business, and of the first three tracks here, although I favoured Gideon Solider rather easily amongst them, the title track definitely has the most sing along appeal to it while remaining a strong roots track at the same time (and definitely having a lover's (although in this case, warring lovers) vibe to it as well).The Modern Girl album, more than ten years ago, featured a very nice tune by the name of African Girl, thus, it is only fitting that the new Courtney Melody album would feature a much more mature but similar vibes, African Woman. It is quite solid as well, and more along the lines of old school Melody, but still in the modern style. I also really love the vibe on Two Wrongs, which almost has an American R&B; vibe to it, it is the album's changeup, and you kind of see where it was going, Melody definitely has the ability to succeed with such a track and, while far from the album's best, Two Wrongs is a solid addition.The album actually peaks, however, closer to the end. Check the OUTSTANDING Oh Jah, which was my choice for the album's best offering for quite awhile, and still is one of my favourites here definitely. Following Oh Jah is my choice for the best lover's track here, Key To Your Heart. Key To Your Heart is a track which partially succeeds due to the wonderful old school nature of the track, you could very well pluck it from Serious Business and drop it on Modern Girl and you wouldn't notice a difference in the vibes of the elder album. Nuttn Nah Gwan is a `seriously' strong piece which features probably the strongest lyrical performance here overall. This streak of very nice tunes concludes with the nicest of them all. In Deh is the only official combination on Serious Business (although there are some very strong backing vocalists performances throughout) and it features Jah Mason (who hopefully stopped by to do work on his follow-up to Unlimited). The song is POWERFUL and it has both the big feel which Mason's tunes usually have due to his energetic flow and at the same time, Melody's very smooth and subtle style and it always has a sound that feels as if it is building to a peak. The peak is the entire song, definitely one of for the record, an excellent roots uplifting track and I would love to see it receive a video and some decent promotions. I would have loved to see more combinations as well, if any turned out the way In Deh did, we might be talking about a five star album with Serious Business.Oh, and I have to mention the truly BIG vibes of Nah Born A Killa. Yet another very strong roots track and something which sounds as if it could have come from the catalogue of Jr. Reid (who vocally Courtney Melody is resembling throughout Serious Business in my opinion, just an octave lower perhaps) or Everton Blender or some of the more venerable rootical reggae singers.Overall, Serious Business is seriously high quality roots reggae. The more and more I went through the album and saw Melody was very much succeeding in the roots style, I was actually wishing that Jahmikes had done more with Kingston native. Although Reggae Vibes isn't exactly a household name in terms of labels, the label has had quiet a nice working relationship with many artists and has released compilations featuring some of the biggest names in reggae, alongside even delving into the promotional and managerial side of reggae as well. A Courtney Melody/Sizzla Kalonji combination would have put Serious Business through the roof! As it is, I can't complain too much as I fully expect to see a next Melody album on the label and what they have done with this album is very impressive. Serious Business features one of the TRUE veterans of the dancehall showing that he is no one-trick pony and pushing one of the overall strongest pure roots projects of 2007.

The interesting story behind the Hardtimes riddim is that its co-creator, the legendary Jamaican engineer Errol Thompson, died shortly after completing the riddim which made the big bad Hardtimes riddim one of his final works. And fittingly he does so with Stephen Gibson, son of the legendary Joe Gibbs.Musically speaking, just listening to the sound alone (which VP was wise enough to include on the final track of the album) Thompson went out on top. The unique one drop created by the Spanish guitar is indeed way more than slightly interesting and it becomes one of the very few riddims which are standable over an album for despite never changing which is popular amongst dancehall producers.The only real problem with the record is the odd artist selection. Bascom X, Cezar, Latoya, a returning Kulcha Knox, Marcus I and Iyts a Flames aren't exactly household names even in the reggae world, and this was definitely a riddim which required some of the bigger names which are absent (i.e. Sizzla, Bushman, Anthony B. etc.). Representing for the big names are Capleton, Luciano and Junior Kelly, all of whom score reasonably well, especially the Prophet with the riddim's best offering, the massive That Day Will Come. Of the newbies and the unknowns, I Wayne does quite well with his hit Living in Love as does Bascom X on Lonely Girl. Latoya has obviously mastered the Beyonce' pitch and lets it all go on More Than Confused which is 'decent'. The 5th Element crew touches down completely with Chuck Fender, Richie Spice and Anthony Cruz all recording here with only Cruz missing the mark with the not-witty-enough Mari-wanna. Oddly enough one of my favorite tunes here is from unknown Cezar which just shows the surprising confidence of the young artist who should only be getting better.Overall, sure I would have loved to see some more of the roots staples on this one, but ultimately giving the rookies a chance is something that must be done on a big riddim. The tune itself holds is own and was definitely one of the best of 2004 (the other 2 of course being the I Swear and Drop Leaf riddims respectively). You probably have to be a rootshead to really really appreciate the power of the Hardtimes, and if you can, you'll REALLY appreciate it.

This album is just great all around. There is absolutely no bad songs to be found here, no weak songs, and no songs that feel like they simply do not belong, every song is worth listening to several times. This is the type of record that grows on people, so it may take you a while before you can completely appreciate it. My favourite songs are Thought For Today which sounds a little experimental for Sizzla, I like Higher Heights, I like To the Point, Hold Her In My Arms and Streetside Knowledge is very good as well, however, my absolute favourite has to be Taking Over which is awesome. While I wouldn't call this a crossover attempt, it contains several hip-hop elements especially on Brand New, which is a decent cut. And of course Sizzla represents his religion at all times, and it is there that his lyrics are at their greatest, which is forte. Overall, like I said, it is a just an album that is consistently spectacular, a 15 track album sans a single bad song is very rare, but here it is from Sizzla Kalonji.

(4.5 stars)Capleton is one of the very few artists that seem to get better as his career goes along. That's not to say that this album which catches the prophet in the middle of his career is not a good album. The Best of Capleton showcases Capleton in his earlier post rude-boy status, and really has some of his better tracks of the time. The album's best is easily Tour, which besides Who Dem? might be my favorite Prophet song. Also check Almshouse (his actual conversion tune), Old and Young, Wings of the Morning, Leave Babylon and of course Babylon a Use Dem Brain with Kalonji from the Black Woman &amp; Child album. By the way the tune &quot;Leave Babylon has one of the wickedest hooks I've heard in a long time, but that is one of Capleton's strengths, see How it Ago from Still Blazin' and Twist and Turn from the underground Brickwall album Forces of Nature (an album with Sizzla). Overall, I say for the price, you can't beat this one with a bat, very very good cuts, even the sleeve is good, offers a great overview of Capleton's career. I'd recommend this one to maybe newer fans: older fans will probably know every tune by heart.

I think Don Yute's best musical quality might actually be the downfall of this album. Yute has what he calls world-hop, and its new and innovating and exciting, all that good stuff. However, on Adrenalin, it just really never seems to get off the ground. Yute seemingly has a hard time deciding if he wants to do dancehall or hip-hop and while several top dancehall artists also share the same problem (i.e. Elephant Man, Baby Cham) those artists ultimately pull it off brilliantly, where Yute's star pretty much just stops shining. He has guestspots from some of dancehalls current royalty including Wayne Wonder and Mr. Vegas on Lovin Excess and Bamboo De Yah respectively but even they fail to save the quality of this album from dropping so low. He also has a track (Yu Own De Man) produced by Dave Kelly and a Sean Paul riddim on Gal Catalogue, also a guest spot from rapper Chyna White, but none of it, and I mean none of it helps too much. Overall, I think the thing that might have most helped this album is a better flow by Don Yute, he needs to work on his skills and he probably shouldn't even have had an album at this point in his career, also his best song (Get It On with Cecile isn't even on the album. I would only recommend this if you are an absolute nutty fan, in which case you probably already have this one, otherwise, just wait and see if Yute gets better with more experience.

I wrote a review not to long ago about a Junior Kelly album and I mentioned that, through no fault of his own efforts, Kelly remained perhaps one of the most underrated and underappreciated artist in Jamaica. Prince Malachi is in nearly the same boat as Kelly, although there is some blame to go to the feet of Malachi as he just doesn't seem to have the desire to record enough to make himself a greater staple because as Runaway Slave proves, his talent is endless!The Xterminator veteran has in more recent years been more likely to be found playing instruments on studio sessions rather than actually in the booth himself and the world of reggae is ever so slightly not such a nice place because of it. The London born Malachi falls squarely in line with such singers as Luciano and Bushman as the deep baritone booming voiced nature styled singer who uses every octave of that voice to impress the masses.And impress he does in this overlooked piece. When I first heard the opener, Go Ur Way, I thought the record company had made a mistake by calling the album Runaway Slave, Go Ur Way HAD to be the best tune here. I was wrong, the #1 tune is Runaway Slave, an absolutely divine laid back tune which showcases the effectiveness of Malachi's writing as he melds himself to a beautiful Stingray one drop riddim.Also really really love the cultural ode to Marcus Garvey Can't Control I; Strong Herb; the aforementioned Go Ur Way and Moses Staff, as well as Keep I Strong. There are NO bad tunes on the album and not once does Malachi and Stingray deviate from reggae, you wont find a hint of crossover here at all!Overall, definitely check out Runaway Slave and be absolutely happily surprised as I was when I first gave it a comprehensive listen. I will say that if you're kind of on the fence about reggae music, don't start here, Runaway Slave is one for the reggae purist.

Long Way- Iley Bless15. Never Had to Lie- Omar Silk16. Zion Gate- Ultimate ShineThe latest installment of VP Record's Riddim Driven series features one of the biggest cultural riddims in a long time. The I Swear riddim from the burgening 5th Element Camp is awesome and its highlighted by some of the lesser known artists in Jamaica right now.Today for a riddim album really to succeed it almost has to have some kind of glitch, something it does to differentiate the songs from each other besides the artists themselves. Super producers such as Lenky Marsden, Vendetta and Dave Kelly have stepped to the forefront on version albums because of their ability to change most, if not all the tunes. The I Swear riddim never actually changes, but the tunes sound different because its builder Devon from 5th Elements enlisted the help of backup singers on nearly every tune. Another area in which it is different is that the stars here are really the newer artists, even though truly big and established artists are present (i.e. Luciano, Junior Kelly, Sizzla & Pliers) the young/unestablished artists really shine through here.The best tune here is the title track I Swear I would venture to say that when the producer heard Chuck Fender's lyrics he decided to call the riddim by the song's name, its truly a big tune and its drawing me closer to buying the yute's album (which is in part the reason for albums like this). Also like Marijuana by 5th Element artist Richie Spice (Pliers' younger brother), Mama's Blessing from Anthony Cruz, Conquer Them by Guyana's own Natural Black (which sounds and borrows slightly lyrically from Sizzla's song of the same title) and Your Goals by an artist I had NEVER heard of before Jah Penco. Buried on this album is a tune called Long Way by Iley Bless who I have heard of before but had never really paid a heavy ear to, he almost locks the flow off on that one, it sounds really good; and of course Melchezidek (formerly Chezidek) from the Xterminator camp sets it off nicely on What a Life. There are no bad songs the vets don't really shine here, but For You, Woman to Man, and Why Can't you, from Sizzla, Richie Stephens and Pliers, respectively, are good tunes as well (so are Jr. Kelly's and Luciano's tunes Dem Story and Tell Me as well). And check out Jah Cure's downright odd vocal style on Good Morning Jah Jah!Overall, my only complaints here are that the riddim track itself isn't present without artist and that artists such as Bushman, Turbulence, Queen Omega (or a woman at all for that matter) or Jah Mason didn't record on the riddim (which isn't really a good complaint at all) I'd without a doubt reccommend this one and hold it up as the best version album I've heard all year.Very big riddim, big album, check it out.

2003 was Turbulence's year. The year that might be spoken of like 1997 is for his mentor Sizzla Kalonji. He dropped 5 complete albums, for 5 different labels and each of the 5 were different as far as content and message. The best of these albums was definitely Join Us, although they all were fairly near the top as far as quality.The Truth is certainly right in the middle of those as it presents probably, lyrically, the deepest episode of Turbulence yet. If you're into the meditative/spiritual part of Rastafarian music then this is the one you need to seek out first. The pictures in the sleeves display the artist as a part of nature, in garden adornment and the album continues along that line. The best song here is without a doubt the closer Selassie I, very very spiritual and really displays Turbulence's development lyrically. Also check the title track, and I'd Rather Be. A lot of this album is directed towards women, and the artist's love of Black women.Overall, I continue to be impressed with Sheldon Campbell's development as an artist, and I'm very interested to see exactly where his message continue's to spread and take his music.

Being Sizzla's first official new release since his hit Da Real Thing, i really didn't expect too much from it. And when i saw the track list, i expected even less, Jet Star doesn't usually put out Kalonji's best album of the year, but they do usually do respectable projects. Light of My World is honestly no exception. The best thing i could say about it is, no its not as good as Da Real Thing, its on par with Ghetto Revolution, very similar to that album, but this album sounds very very good. Certainly more to the credit of Sizzla than the album's producers, his voice sounds awesome on some points of this one. My favorite tune here is oddly enough Babylon is Burning, which is more like his usual lyrical domination on a nyabinghi foundation and it sticks out here. The main point on this album is love, most of the songs are about his love of women (which is certainly a great thing) thats the whole point of the album. Also check Reason for My Love, which goes all over the place on a hip-hop influenced beat, and same thing for Need. Like the title tune as well very very good and the dancehall tune Wreckage. A side note is the very good article on the liners by John Masouri. Overall, a very good well presented project, no its not his best work and it wont be remembered as such, but it is very respectable, sounds great, very good production and sets the tone for the year for what is certain to be another full of shocking new material from music's reigning lyrical king.

The ridiculously high level of roots reggae emanating from outside of Jamaica continues to grow and grow. With such networks as Trinidad and Tobago, the US (and British for that matter) Virgin Islands and even St. Vincy getting involved in pushing some of the finest current roots material, the rest of the Caribbean is serving notice to Jamaica that the message is being heard and followed. Another venue bubbling nicely with hardcore roots talents over the past decade is often overlooke Guyana in South America. Artists such as Yahadanai from the I-Grade camp (who needs a new album like yesterday), Ras Mac Bean and up and coming group act First Born are slowly putting Guyana on the map as a force to be reckoned with in the reggae world. Generally, every single artist, as it has been to date to emerge from Guyana has been all about chatting conscious lyrics over the nice solid one drop riddims to which the trend has been reverting to recently in Jamaica, and no different to that vibe is easily the most successful, and unusual talent to ever come Guyana (with the exception, of course, of Eddy Grant) in the reggae arena, Natural Black. Black, who has taken his career to the home of reggae music, moving to Jamaica over a year ago. Natural Black has paved the way for a future (and reportedly wickedly deep aside from just First Born) of Guyanese roots reggae artists to follow, having attained a newly found level of popularity here in Jamaica, routinely only to natives.Aside from representing his own homeland, Black also represents the new wave of new-age roots reggae talent absolutely brimming in Jamaica. The `new class' features a healthy mix of wicked singers, chanters as well as pure dj's and offers what will probably prove to be some of the most crucial artists to ever emerge in reggae music. Names such as I-Wayne, Jah Cure, Lutan Fyah, Fantan Mojah and Turbulence all prove to at the very least attempt to take the music to the next level, filling the shoes of such legends as Sizzla Kalonji (who is still relatively young, I.e. younger than Black), Capleton, Anthony B and Luciano. While Lutan Fyah figures to be the dominant lyricist and the soon release Cure, the dominant singer of that bunch (and Turbulence, the dominant. . . Recorder) Natural Black's place in the mix is still to be determined. Black, whose style is probably best described as a lightened up version of Buju Banton, has scored hits previously in Jamaica, including To My Bonafide, Songs With Feelings and his first #1 track Far From Reality over Vendetta's sparkling Seasons Riddim.That brings us forth to Cool Nuh Black. The album, officially Natural Black's fourth to date (with the fifth, Jah Guide, already loaded and ready to go from Greensleeves) , finds Black rightfully linking up with one of the most underrated producers in the game, Vizion Sounds' Walter Fraser. Fraser, a Guyana native himself, has been fully responsible for pushing some of the heavier vibes coming out of Guyana. Besides being in-house producer, as well as manager for First Born, Fraser's Vizion Sounds was also responsible for recording the criminally overlooked Gideon from Luciano in 2005, which featured the Messenjah taking such a unique variation on his style, towards a more story telling vibes, including the brilliant Unsolved Mystery, was my choice for one of the most overlooked albums of that year, and a long time in reggae altogether. The marriage of Guyana's biggest producer and the country's biggest act altogether in reggae , seemed only a logical match (now if someone could just give Yahadanai the address) seemed like such a `natural' fit and the results amount to what may actually be Black's most diverse set to date. His previous albums, with the exception of his most recent, the brilliant Far Away From Reality, have been very very solid, but somewhat suffered on the production side due to a lack of imagination (not including the crazy crazy Chiguen, on his debut, World War), thankfully Fraser's work doesn't suffer from such fallout as he has spared no expense in tapping some of the finest studios and session players to back Black.Natural Black's true skill and best talent has always been his free-wheeling nature and his ability to pull vibes from almost anywhere (pick up his second album, Spiritual Food to see exactly what I mean, some CRAZY melodies on that album) and although he can always go with the more traditional style (check the Far From Reality album), he seems far more at home when the reins are left completely off. While Fraser doesn't exactly let him do whatever crosses his mind ( I imagine that would have made Cool Nuh Black a double (and maybe even triple) album), he does give him more leeway than any of his previous 3 producers. Thus, as I mentioned the results are very diverse as `Cool' finds Black trying several different styles, seamlessly going from ruff, ganja driven DJ, straight to solemn chanting Rastaman and to (close friend and mentor) Beres Hammond style lover's rock singer without so much as batting an eye.The best track on Cool Nuh Black is probably the rather high pulsed opener, High Grade. The song is perhaps the finest example of Black's bst talent on the entire Cool Nuh Black album, he is able to save a vibes from going sour by merely. . . being himself. Love the usage of background singers on High Grade, and although it stands as the album's obligatory herbalist track (and I challenge you to find a modern roots reggae album which doesn't have one), it is a truly powerful track which at one point finds Black turning pure singer. High Grade is also armed with one of the finest hooks on Cool Nuh Black, with again, credit going to the background singers and Fraser.After High Grade you still have very powerful tracks. The best (and I actually go back and forth between it and High Grade as the album's standout) is the lovely Exalt His Name. The lush nyah drum backing gives it a nice power which makes it sound like something from Tarrus Riley's or Warrior King's recent catalogue. Exalt His Name is, of course, a praising track to HIM, and one of the finest styles of those tracks you'll find anywhere within the past 5 years or so, its wonderful! Exalt His Name is actually one of the tracks that makes the entire Cool Nuh Black album better (I know that sounds odd, but as a WONDERFUL example of such a phenomenon, check Health & Strength from Warrior King's debut, Virtuous Woman). So if you happen to have the fortune (as I did) of playing the album straight through, the track which immediately follows Exalt His Name, Any Means Necessary, will sound so much better! Any Means Necessary is MASSIVE! A continuance along that same vibe, and you'll arrive at Cool Nuh Black's strongest love track, the aptly titled Special Love. The song actually leads the album into a more laid back type of vibe with which you'll probably actually best remember it for, but without a doubt, Special Love is amongst Natural Black's most compelling offerings in his entire career.Probably the single-most interesting track on Cool Nuh Black, however, is the closer, Jah Blessings with up and coming Guyanese group, First Born. Its actually a combination I've been waiting to hear (along with Black and the wicked wicked Ras Mac Bean) and its to Fraser's credit and Cool Nuh Black's benefit that it has now, exclusively (it missed First Born's most recent album, Irits) been included here. The track is amongst the album's most uptempo and bouncy and works nicely, showing the third nice combination from First Born with a major artist after the nice Uplift Yourself with Fantan Mojah, produced by Fraser for Mojah's debut Hail the King; and the even stronger Cut and Go Through combination with Luciano from the Gideon album, definitely nice works and a nicer catalogue being built by the young First Born.There are no weak tracks here at all, however, other standouts include the rather vibrant Found my Roots bubbling nicely over one of the most complicated riddims on the album, love that track (probably armed with the greatest 'slow dance potential' on Cool Nuh Black), although it is one of the more straight forward tracks on the album. Check (speaking of complicated) I've Got Love. I've Got Love is yet another half-style from Black as he goes from his usual chant to throwing it up a pitch with virtually no warning over the high-tech one-drop Fraser riddim. Lastly, I'd recommend Heathen, sounding like something straight out of Tuff Gong studio (where at least a portion of Cool Nuh Black was recorded). Heathen captures Black in a solemn mood, but ripping one of the best tracks on the album altogether, and would actually be my choice for the first single here (if not Gideon Soldier, which I have to mention).My only real complaint of Cool Nuh Black would be the failure to include a real dancehall vibes. Natural Black has one of the most comprehensive and raw styles out there, definitely would have loved to see Fraser take full advantage of it, so although still a very very strong album, Cool Nuh Black does have a somewhat mechanical feel to it, however, one that is easily forgivable.Overall, definitely recommending this hard to find gem. Loved seeing it available on Amazon (now hopefully they can line up Gideon and Irits)which may mean teh label, Vizion Sounds, is putting a bigger effort into promotion. However, regardless of how you may encounter Cool Nuh Black, definitely find a way. It may someday prove to be a landmark album in Guyanese reggae, and hopefully we can see some more fine performances by Black in support of the album in Guyana (and I'm going if that happens!). Cool Nuh Black should be treated as what it is, every bit as landmark as what Midnite has done for the VI (StX), what Queen Omega did for Trinidad and what Ossie Dellimore did for St Vincy. Its the rest of the Caribbean showing that His Majesty's teachings have pierced the community as a whole and is being heard. Now YOU go hear Cool Nuh Black.

Despite the fact that I keep albums in my players rotating in and out at an almost ridiculous pace, there have been and continues to be a few here and there which manage to, for one reason or another, stay not too far from my reach and thus, one of the eternal answers to that oft-asked question, "What are you listening to right now?". Well, RIGHT NOW I happen to be listening to a whole heap of pieces. Not surprisingly at all you'll find relatively new releases such as Ziggi's sublime sophomore album, In Transit; you'll also find a Lutan Fyah's EPIC double release Africa (currently waiting on his new album, African Be Proud); Daweh Congo's Ghetto Skyline is in there as well as is, perhaps most fittingly in this case, the constantly `improving' Breaking Babylon Curse from Messenjah Selah which I enjoy more and more each time that I spin it. In the tangible sense, all of those albums would make perfect sense to be spinning right now: They all were released within the last four to five months or so and are definitely BIG albums in their own right. And, even to take it a step further, were I to say that I was that I was currently listening to something like Sizzla's Black Woman & Child or Capleton's More Fire, despite both being either more than or just less than a decade old, they too would make sense because they are widely held as being two of the best of all time. That being said I also have a few albums which are kind of `stuck' in terms of time being around three to ten years old or so and they didn't do a ton of damage and were relatively either decently received or, in some cases, even negatively received when they initially were pushed out. For example, should you check what's currently playing on my speakers at this very moment and it's been there for quite awhile, you might be surprised that its another Sizzla album which wasn't too well regarded when it reached and still isn't, Rastafari Teach I Everything from all the way back in 2001. I know people who will literally call RTIE a BAD album, but to me, it's a sleeper as one the August Town Wizard's lower level better albums and just a BEAUTIFUL piece when you really sit down and take a note of it. Another very good example from that same year (and same label actually) would curiously be [General] Degree's WICKED Yeah Man. That PACKED album, in my opinion, was one of the best PURE Dancehall releases from the past decade and although it definitely didn't get the attention it deserved, it has continued through the years to retain a very welcome spot in my players. Other examples would be albums like Lyricson's Born 2 Go High from 2004, Chezidek's at times AMAZING debut album Harvest time which reached in 2002 and probably ALL of Peter Broggs' catalogue which unfortunately tends to go under noticed. These albums aren't necessarily the GREATEST actually but for some reason they've managed to stick with me over time and are still sticking.But there is undoubtedly something VERY ODD going on with the things that I am CURRENTLY listening to, with three in particular standing out. The first would be the aforementioned Breaking Babylon Curse by Messenjah Selah which I reviewed and rated four stars. I may someday rank BBC as high as five (EASILY) because that album really takes a while to grow on you and you definitely need to take a more MATURE approach to it to be able to appreciate it. The second would be an album by the name of Holding Firm by wicked Virgin Islands chanter Ras Attitude from back in 2005 (I THINK) which came and went in my collection before I actually gave it a proper spin and discovered that it was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. That album almost single-handedly made me recognize that my tastes were changing and I had become a much `older' listener than I was before. Now, fittingly, is the third album, Yami Bolo's Rebelution from back in 2003 originally which has FINALLY gone digital courtesy of a label based in Florida in the States, Zion High Productions. If Holding Firm made me take notice that my tastes were changing in Reggae music, Rebelution CONFIRMED those thoughts as I not only LOVE this album, but it made me go back and take a look at Yami Bolo's ENTIRE career and catalogue and you know what? I ultimately gained a new appreciation of that material as well. Of course the odd bit of `coincidence' here is that all three albums, Breaking Babylon Curse, Holding Firm and Rebelution are primarily Zion High Productions albums which kind of is a weird quality that their albums have (as if the slogan might be, "You'll love this stuff. . . In a couple of years) and they can lay claim to putting out the best `time delayed' material in Reggae altogether. After that time period passes, however, and you take another look at all of these albums what you'll find is CRISP and very MATURE work between the three, particularly in Holding Firm and now with BBC and as I find new and very interesting things (especially lyrically) in that album almost everyday. I do feel, however, that Rebelution is the best of that lot. This album is one of my favourites of Yami Bolo's entire overlooked career. For years he has been on the outside of a very select lot of singers which has, primarily, included the likes of Luciano and now with the up and coming Roots Reggae singers like Jah Cure and I-Wayne, he figures to get even more pushed aside, ranking alongside CRIMINALLY underappreciated artists of similar ilk such as Everton Blender, the aforementioned Daweh Congo and maybe even someone like former Xterminator artists Mikey General and Prince Malachi would also fit into that list. And even amongst that VERY STRONG list of artists, Bolo may just be underappreciated as well and it's really a shame that so much of his music goes unnoticed, especially locally speaking, because really and truly there haven't been too many more consistent names than Yami Bolo since he first entered the business, if TRULY any at all. Thus, it isn't too difficult for me to say that if you have been amongst the masses sleeping on the singer, Rebelution would be an EXCELLENT starting point for you to make up for lost time.The vibes on Rebelution, unsurprisingly, are VERY much on the spiritual side which should be nothing new for longtime Yami Bolo fans. And for new fans, I'll also mention that vocally Bolo probably falls into that same line of singers like Mykal Rose and the likes with the kind of WAILING sound that he employs so often, but there is a REFINED bit in his voice at times also, sounding more like Everton Blender to my ears than most would say. Of course now that I trumped up the spiritual nature of Rebelution, Yami Bolo begins the album with a love song (DUH!). This love song, the very nice Empress I Love You definitely has quite a bit of spiritual and conscious connotations to it, so it more than fits in (and you KNEW one would be on the album) on the project and, despite being on the lower end in terms of overall songs quality, it's still a very nice opener to get things started. The far more expected Pray is up next for Rebelution and it certainly lifts the album to the stratosphere and proves to be one of it's best tunes altogether in it's time. The song is just DIVINE and is so without using really any type of `tricks' in terms of taking the music or the vibes or the lyrics in any type of radical direction. Instead, Bolo simply pushes a message that times are well hard and we definitely need to pray for the better. Agreed! And you'll agree that the tune is near magic. Bridging the gap between the opening tracks and the body of the album is the arguably even stronger Good Must Conquer Evil over a very familiar minimalist riddim from Zion High (which develops into a `complexly vacant' beautiful composition). This tune is full of knowledge gives the listener about as strong of an example of what to expect with the balance of Rebelution as anything on the album's opening.Despite the fact that Yami Bolo makes a few combinations with big artists it's SPECIFICALLY the tunes which feature him and him alone which stand out and have stood up to me the most obvious representing the power of Rebelution. The PRIME example of this and ultimately the finest tune on Rebelution to my opinion is the AWESOME tune Accident. Livicated to the well famous case of Mumia Abu Jamal, I can particularly recall when this tune HIT me and when it did it brought tears, it brought crazy emotions as I tuned in and heard him directly say, "Babylon is like an accident!". POWERFUL! Trust me, definitely not to be missed a real microcosm of the entire album and perhaps even all of ZHP's pieces as it builds and builds until it finally has you. Accident begins a very powerful string of tunes which ultimately send out Rebelution as, after it, there are nothing but WINNING tunes. Do No Evil is a very easy and bouncing tune which encourages all to do exactly what the title says (its kind of the changeup here, if that role doesn't belong to Accident). Following Do No Evil is the sole combination on the second half of the album and DEFINITELY one of the best tunes on Rebelution in full, the very inspirational and HEAVY Hail The Conquering Lion which features Bolo alongside the legendary Ras Michael. This tune is for the Rastafarian crowd FAR AND AWAY. Now, should you follow that path in life (and I do) then this tune will speak to you on so many different levels than probably any tune up until this point on Rebelution altogether. It well remains that way, however, for a very short period of time as, in keeping with that vibes, the next tune, Crownation Glory, is an even larger step up. CROWNATION GLORY is MAMMOTH! To no exaggeration this tune, probably even more so than Accident, has been the one which has stuck so closely with me. I play this song for my plants in my house! It's just a wonderfully big vibes in praise of His Majesty before `ascending' into a sweet sweet ending definitely not to be missed. Still on a similar vibes is the next tune, Safe Guard, which, although not as strong as the two tunes immediately preceding it, has a `bigger' sound to it which is the attraction on the surface before you get into that wonderful message of the people really needing to protect ourselves from just the evil and corrupt system (Safe Guard may be the best WRITTEN tune on Rebelution altogether). Binghi is just what it sounds like, the obligatory nyah drum backed tune on the album and, as usual because I love these songs, it's a real winner, just a nice chanting vibes for His Imperial Majesty (I might have preferred it as the closer though). And it sets the stage for the actual finisher on Rebelution, the rather understated Y Mas Gan which rolls in on a Spanish/Acoustic sound and doesn't really develop much but may just be the most personally sang tune on the album and in such a reflective nature you can't argue with it's choice for the album in full and not even with it's placement as the closer. Going backwards to check on the combinations: Ithiopia is BIG. Yami Bolo sings SO sweet on the hook there alongside my not so favourite Al Pancho and Prince Bob of all people (+3 to anyone who knew Prince Bob) that he well outshines his friends on the tune even before checking in later on with his own full verse which just wraps things so nicely. Liberation is the highest profile combination on Rebelution as it reunites Bolo with Capleton and does so, so wonderfully to my ears as they infuse the same riddim which backed Turbulence's MASSIVE tune We Need Liberation (alongside Digital Ancient). And Talk About Slavery links Bolo with both underrated Bunny Mystic and General Jah Mikey (who is WICKED). This may be the finest combination outside of Hail The Conquering Lion and however you place them, they're all very well done and impeccable on an equally impeccable album.(oh! And check the HEAVY Sanctify Yourself Rebelution's second best written tune)Overall, I do feel the need not to OVERRATE Yami Bolo's Rebelution. I don't give it five stars because it simply isn't a five star album. It's not the best album I've ever heard (it probably isn't even in the top twenty or so actually) and I don't want to make you think it is. HOWEVER, Rebelution is an album which simply just struck me on SO MANY levels as having a very `familiar' and `comforting' vibes that, even in spite of the nature of Roots Reggae which can paint a very bleak picture at times, still managed to be uplifting throughout. This album has a very natural `human appeal' to it and like I said, if you can take a step back and listen to the entire album and meditate on it a bit and then listen it again. You, you already well indoctrinated roots Reggae fan (newer fans I don't recommend this one for you), will find the same thing I found in Yami Bolo's Rebelution: It's not the greatest, not even close, but it is one of my favourite albums of all time. Period.

Producing a good riddim album these days, unfortunately, takes a lot more than just making a good riddim. Some riddims, while still holding up their end of the bargain as absolute genius intrumentals are simply battered down over the course of a 12-20 track album by absolutely HORRID vocal performances (i.e. the Bionic Ras riddim album, the Reflections riddim album, and of course, the HORRIBLE Goldmine riddim album). And also by contrast, excellent vocal performances just cannot saved a junk riddim from failure (i.e., the Chaka Chaka and for the greatest example of such, one only needs to perform a search for 'Wipeout Riddim', after reading this review of course). This, unfortunate combinations of events is typically, but not exclusively limited to the slew of young up and coming producers emerging from JA's dancehalls; so who could explain the absolute curse which has seemed to cloud the legendary Steely & Cleevie?The legendary musicians/producers two most recent efforts on the riddim album circuit (to my knowledge) was the nice nice Sleepy Dog and the. . . weird Old Truck riddims. While coming from opposite ends of the spectrum, both albums nearly suffered from the same problems: Being strong at the top and very very weak below the top. While the top for the Old Truck was very thin (if I remember correctly Lexus had the best tune on that riddim), the 'bottom' (speaking in terms of quality) was sooooooooo bad! Not exempt from the curse was the mighty Sleepy Dog, which produced a few JA #1 tunes. Both riddims were relicks and refashionings of older riddims, as has become the trend in dancehall today (although I feel its slowly returning to more modern terms).Not so shockingly, the dynamic duo's most recent album, the Twice Again riddim, is also a resurrection of sorts. The same track (in a slightly less amped version) they had originally built for Shabba's combination with Krystal, the superb Twice My Age. The Twice Again riddim just might be one of the best dancehall compositions I've EVER heard, its that powerful! Combined with the presence of one of the best tracks you'll ever hear just makes it a huge vibes. . . but then again, I remember saying something similar about the Sleepy Dog.First the negatives. I keep hoping (apparently against hope) that Buccaneer would catch up to the rest of the world in realizing that the 'Kingston Meets Austria' operatic vibes he's been kicking for the past decade+ has been annoying for the past decade+. His go on the TA Land We Love, although based on the best song ever written (the Jamaican National Anthem) is horrible! Fellow former Main Street artist Mr G (formerly Goofy) doesn't have a much better go at it, but at least he tries no tricks and I can't exactly call his Pump Up horrible, its just thoroughly boring. Ghost could never be called boring, the adjective reserved for him is annoying and even moreso here on his What You Gonna Do, as through the several changes S&C; take the Twice Again through, Ghost receives probably the finest, but all he can muster is a nice chorus. Also, whoever Guru (probably not the one you're thinking about), Meeks & Meeks and Kieshera are, they unfortunately join lord king mediocre Harry Toddler's Top Shotta Ting and legendary singer Leroy Smart's Memory Thing (which gets better and better the less Smart sings and relies on his EXCELLENT chorus like backups) as just being not up to par!But what's good?You won't get a second into playing this album before stumbling onto something SPECIAL. The opener Buju's Beauty Queen is amongst the strongest tracks from '06 and Buju's career as a whole and reminds us that Gargamel has been absent from the dancehalls for nearly a decade only BY CHOICE, as his skill in the area hasn't diminished at all. This is followed by the nice, but ultimately annoying She Wants a Life by young vet Assassin. The song is very very strong, but has a much better version with the same lyrics named What This Girl Thinking?, which apparently has been limited to just JA. She Wants a Life has some annoying chorus kid/computer fill in and almost ruins a very very strong track.Also check, shockingly, Baby Cham, checking in on the strong Woman Deh Pon Mi Mind. Its always interesting to see just which riddims Cham chooses to voice when making his detour back to the cool confines of Mad House and this effort has matched previous strong non-Dave Kelly tracks of recent years over the Good to Go and Career riddims, respectively. Veterans Macka Diamond and Mr Vegas both offer nice efforts. Macka on what may be my favorite song from she EVER, Bad Macka in an old school stylee, befitting her vast vault of experience and Vegas, who these days can almost ammount to as close a Steely & Cleevie house artist that exists. And check 2 new artists, Sweet C (who holds the distinction of voicing the only decent vocal track after #7 on this album) with her excellent, although gimmicky Together; and an artist who also had one of the best tracks on the Sleepy Dog with Mixing Board, Famous Face, looking nice on his well solid Legs Up, he seems to have an out style in his basic style, making hanging around the production pair a nice place to be for him.Overall, yes, this is the best recent riddim from Steely & Cleevie and of course the best riddim album (although thats not saying much). However, I only feel comfortable enough to recommend this one to STRICTLY dancehall heads. I always appreciate when the riddim changes throughout a riddim album, thus giving each song (or at least some of them) their own identity apart from the others, and although this Twice Again doesn't do it too much, it does it enough to earn points for that as well (most notably, unfortunately, on Ghost's track). Making a solid riddim album has a great deal to do with merging the proper artists with the riddim, and while I'm certain that Steely & Cleevie have forgotten more about this than I know, they have struggled with it in the recent past, hopefully the Twice Again is a sign they're headed in a better direction.

I'm almost tempted to say about Rupee's latest album that if listening to it doesn't make you feel good then you probably passed away not too long ago and have yet to notice it. The vibes on this one is sooooooooooo strong, and not really a dance vibe either on most of the tunes, more like a party vibe, and if you love the Carib. certainly you cna appreciate the material here. My favorite song here is incidentally, the one I'm most familiar with Tempted to Touch, which to this day I'm certain could do major damage in the US should it recieve any backing at all (ATTENTION VP). Rupee's voice isn't anything overly spectacular, he doesn't have a outstanding penchant for writing lyrics or anything either, but what he does have is the ability to ride ragga soca riddims just about as good as anyone doing it. Also check You Never Know, Festival Again, Uh Oh!, the wicked combination with Destra If You Only Knew, Enjoy Yourself with Red Rat, and DTDT as the bonus. Overall, this one is highly recommended by me, also recommended is catching a Rupee stage show if possible, his vibe on record transform well to the stage.Sleeper album of the year, this artist should be signed to a bigger label. (ATTENTION VP)

I've been full aware of the mysterious St Croix Bobo Batch for awhile now, his first album Who You Are was more or less an underground hit, and it came with such fanfare that I was surprised to see when I picked up Jah Guidance, his latest effort that he had released an album in between, the much less talked about Keep the Faith. He is a talented vocalist (probably resembling Vaughn Benjamin, lead vocalist of the biggest band Midnite mostly) but his true talents lie behind the board, as the producer of 100% of this album, there are some truly impressive heavy one-drops on this album.His vocal style is of a true chanter, he doesn't dj, sing or singjay, he is a pure chanter, he chants for Jah and on Jah Guidance, does so very impressively. You have to get used to his style to really appreciate it, and it can wear thin throughout a complete album, at times he sounds like pure spoken word, and that goes to a full dj style at times, its truly something different. (AND HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE SAUL WILLIAMS!)I do enjoy Jah Guidance, the real star of the album is the music. As I mentioned, its all his creation and I might go as far as to say he might want to put out an instrumental version of Jah Guidance, he is truly a wizard in the studio. The best tune here is the title track the wail combined with the riddim, works completely and it doesn't take a genius to figure why it was chosen as the name for the album. Also check Zion Kingdom Come, probably the most impressive tune lyrically on the album, works nicely throughout; the familiar (from I dont know where) sound of Fya Blaze and the ony combination on the album, Forward with very animated dj Afyah.The other tunes here are impressive as well, and its with the music here, its very difficult to call any of them bad, the music here is just soooooooooo good, I'd love to hear some other VI artists taking them on, although the master of them does quite a good job.Overall, I consider myself more of a fan of Batch 'protege' the wicked Ras Attitude, but Ras doesn't exist as we know him if not for Batch. If you want to hear some truly amazing one drop riddims backing some impressive chants from 'the other Caribbean' then check out Batch, said it and say it again, the music here is spectacular.

A new Capleton album is like an event in reggae music, even his recently released underground album Da People Them is making waves and getting tons of attention. Unlike his 2 previous VP albums More Fire and Still Blazin', Reign of Fire doesn't quite hit you as hard, thus it takes a while to get to the real vibe, but when you sight it up, you REALLY sight it up.The opener, the massive Jah Is My Everything is probably the best song on the album and a great example of the huge sounding anthemic style songs Capleton is notorious for absolutely destroying, and having seen him perform it live recently I can say that it retains much of its power in the studio version. RoF is literally loaded with such songs Ton Load is an excellent tune which is honestly one of the best ganja anthems in a good while. Love Undeniable, he just breaks down this history copletely on that one, Steppin Up, Wise Up People, Jah By My Side, Leaders Let the People Down and Sunshine Girl with the genius Stephen Marley as well. On the dancehall side, gotta love In Her Heart and Real Hot, the wild Who Yuh Callin' Nigga is completely different. Also, buried on the album is a really good romantic song called Remember the Days, if Jah is My Everything isnt the best tune on RoF then its easily Remember the Days, despite its cheesy intro, the tune really gets going and is truly massive.Overall, I dont even think its necessary to reccommend a Capleton album, if you're reading this you'll probably buy it anyway, its fairly the same the same vibes you've come to expect from the Prophet with Bobby Digital a good number of the songs, and I was happy to see him touch down at Tuff Gong to record at least one tune on the album (Number One Song) Capleton's style fits pretty much inside of their studios like a glove. Also biggup VP for the style of the album very attractive album cover and everything which might attract fans that dont typically buy off the reggae rack.Its a big album, don't listen to me, go get it!

Binghi Ghost is yet another face in the now well forming ranks of young roots reggae talent from the Virgin Islands, in particular, he comes from the very reggae healthy St. Croix. The island has been producing a massive amount of undeniable roots reggae talent, from the truly wicked Sabbattical Ahdah to the sweet voiced Destra and from youthful exuberance of the Star Lion Family to the mighty experienced wisdom vibes of Midnite and Bambu Station.Having recently gained a lot of experience listening to reggae from the VI (and Croix specifically), I went into this, Binghi's debut album, Street Hits with a pretty certain idea of what to expect. I was expecting to hear a very laid back meditative style of vibes with some nice Midnite style backing which is what the area has shown its style to be. The songs are packed with awesome lyrics and the music, beautiful, lush and heavy one-drops akin to old school heavy Jamaican roots.Apparently someone didn't give Binghi the message.Binghi Ghost, who has been WELL travelled to say the least and to my last understanding now resides in California, has a much different style. His style would be best described as St Croix dancehall, although with the exception of his apparent love of hip hop, his brand of dancehall is QUITE similar to Jamaican dancehall (a little too similar even). And nearly all of his combinations come in the form of American hip hop artists. His base style of chatting is a mix of straight djaying and singing and also he tends to rap. He would probably be better should he leave or even further minimalize the rap portion, however.The big combination here is without a doubt the best song on the entire album. Sadness, with established JA chanter Lutan Fyah is a very very nice song and even though it doesn't find Fyah at his best, the tune is still very strong and the best on Street Hits. Also check the immediate following track the very nice Sgt. Brown. Sgt. Brown sounds pretty much like typical JA modern roots vibes, still is a very nice song and may have been able to do some damage were it released in JA. Keeping with that streak, again, the next track Warning and I love the way it transitions into the next song Mother Nature, both are very very strong tracks.The tracks 5-8 are the undoubted highlight of Street Hits, however, I'd also recommend the opener Nah Support (even though the opening speech does get a tad awkward) and definitely Marcus Garvey. Marcus Garvey is amongst the strongest on the album altogether, and a mighty fine track on its own merits.My greatest critique of Street Hits is without a doubt the level of commitment it makes to US hip hop as well as PURE Jamaican dancehall. This is evident almost from the start. Track 2, Shield & The Armor features American hip hop artist (by way of Puerto Rico) Rico Pabon and goes over the GOOD TO GO RIDDIM; The following song, track #3 Good and the Great features Binghi Ghost as a pure dj over another Vendetta riddim, the Mad Ants; He also voices the Martial Arts (Big Up), the Clappas (Dem a Fraud), the Signs (on Mama Earth) and about 2-3 other dancehall or roots riddims which I dont remember the names of.Binghi does right the ship towards the finish of the album, however, ending with Greedy Nation (which sounds EXACTLY how I imagined the entire album would sound) and Skin Dem Burn.Overall, its a very unique fan of reggae who will probably appreciate the vibes on Street Hits. If you are a fan of hip hop, as he has a grand total of five combinations with Hip hop artists, you may appreciate it a great deal. Actually, now that I think about it, Binghi Ghost's Street Hits might be the perfect album for that type of fan of hip hop, looking to experience some deep reggae. It could prove to be a great launching board for such a fan into deep roots reggae music.

I wonder if Beres Hammond's method of making were so closely related to that of some of his peers in reggae music, where he would literally record everyday he spent on the island and write songs by the hour- would that in some way take away from his music's tremendous quality. I wonder if every time I heard a Beres Hammond song would I no longer literally stop everything and just sit there and feel good and listen. I wonder if he started making about 4 albums a year, would his no longer be the greatest voice in dancehall music.While I do actually wonder those things, I'm glad I'm destined to be forever wondering as Hammond shows, wonderfully, no great interest in recording more and more like many of his contemporaries and appears quite happy releasing a new studio album every 2-3 years which is arguably one of the best reggae album of that given year and basically just giving his fans what they want.His new studio album, Love Has No Boundaries is no different as he sets the tone on the opening intro with "I'm that voice thats blowing in the wind. . . I'm that song that will always be around". The interlude (much like Turbulence's on his album Hail to the King) proves ultimately to be one of the best songs on the album. Much like every other BH album that I'm familiar with, there are no bad tunes here, all killers, the best of which is probably the title track, really really big song and you can see exactly why it was chosen as the album's title. Also really love Solid Love, Fell Love, Weary Soldier and Fly Like an Angel. Also on one of the album's best Hammond taps Guyanan singjay, the underrated, Natural Black who almost sounds like Buju at times during his contribution to the tune. Quite naturally Beres goes after the real thing on Thanks fe mi Pride and Joy, which is pretty much your classical standard Beres & Buju combination track, and he also goes after the legendary Big Youth on Good Ol Dancehall Vibes which is a song he tipped his hand on, on his greatest hits album from a year ago.Overall, the best thing I could probably say about this one besides the actual music being good is that its seemless. All of these tunes really go quite well together and just sound perfect. So of course you can't go wrong picking up a Beres Hammond album, its always a big deal, always a great sound, always a great vibe. Love Has No Boundaries is no different, its the latest step of this shamefully undervalued international LEGEND. AMAZING! GO GET IT!

I have long been a fan of Saul Williams back since his slam days with Jessica Care Moore and his first book and everything, but I really don't like this record, I find it to be just very strange. And there's a difference between being a very deep and emotional, and brilliant artist, but this is downright weird, strange stuff starts to happen when you listen to this record. And don't get me wrong, I like the &quot;lyrics&quot; to all the &quot;songs&quot;, he even took some stuff from his books and put it in, but to hear some of that set to music is almost wrong. Overall, there is a thin line between new, revolutionary and weird, Amethyst Rock Star just crossed that line and kept on going.

I got this album mainly based on the material that Determine has put out on other artist's songs, especially the shot he laid out with Sizzla on the classic Mi Lord, also some of the stuff he's done lately with people like Anthony B on Universal Joy. And speaking flatly, Determine can flow, he has a high level of skill at djaying, and when stepping in on other artists tracks, he holds his own absolutely, even with Kalonji, which is unherd of. The best tracks here are the ones where he just lets go and starts flowing, see Nuh Member Love (the albums best track), Nah Go Manage Di Damage, the title Track and the absolutely beautiful Head Corner Stone. Overall, I say absolutely pick this one up, its pretty hard to find, (it took me weeks to find it after I decided that I wanted it)but its worth it. No, Determine's not as good as Kalonji lyrically (nothing to be ashamed of) but he's right in that next group pf artists, so support him now, bigup Brickwall!

Crack open an encyclopedia and look up 'Dancehall Singer' and the first picture you'll see is Beres Hammond with that old leather hat on his head. Beres Hammond has that quintessential voice, dancehall wouldn't be quite the same without him at all. His tunes make Americans wish they were laying on the beach and Jamaicans wish they were sitting in their mother's kitchens or dancing with their special person.You can't go wrong with this Ultimate Collection with 39 tunes strong on the double cd dating back to 1976 there is something for pretty much everyone. If you're really a diehard fan you may have an obscure favourite that isn't available here, (like myself, wondering where the combination with Lady G, 'Have Them In A Cirle' was)but for the most part all of his bigger tunes are here; One Step Ahead, What One Dance Can Do, Putting Up Resistance, Full Attention, Double Trouble, Step Aside and Who Say with Buju Banton and thats just the first disc. Disc 2 features newer hits from the past 10 years as tunes like Can't Stop a Man, Love From a Distance, Warriors Dont Cry, Can You Play Some More, Come Down Father, They Gonna Talk, Rockaway, Ain't it Good to Know and even a new song with Big Youth (Dancehall Vibes) and Giving Thanks. All of that being said my absolute favourite tune on this project and my favourite Beres tune ever is No Disturb Sign, the tune is actually a romantic song, but it just generally makes you feel good.Overall, of course this is a must-have, a definite, if you are a fan of just good music, its a perfect thing to have, the dancehall fan of course, but the R&B; fan as well. The patois isnt too heavy at all so everyone should be able to understand everything and it sounds like general R&B; at points. And on a side-note, this project along with the Sizzla project of last year that was very similar, represent an area in which VPRecords may need to focus more of their attention in producing greatest hits compilations. And surely it might be a great thing to have more VP staple artists with a higher standing to have pieces like this dedicated to them (with Beenie Man already having a double and Lady Saw having a single, next year might be perfect for the Prophet to see the release of his).Anyway, thats my review, now you do yourself a favour and go get this!AMAZING!

Reviewing a Turbulence album isn't very hard at all. Before even hearing an album you make certain assumptions just going into it: There are no bad songs; There are no songs that will blow you away; The lyrics are top notch throughout; Lastly, you will most likely enjoy it. This has been the formula for most of the young artist's work, save for a few albums, such as Rising and Join Us, both of which were pretty much spectacular.This rather 'cursed' (more on that later) album, Nah Sell Out actually is one of his better albums and moves further away from his lesser efforts such as Songs of Solomon and his most recent piece, Notorious. Nah Sell Out fits all Turbulence's points, there are no bad tunes, while there are several good tunes, none of them are smashers, he is lyrically and conceptually as hard as ever and I thoroughly enjoy the album.But what's bad here? Well, this album suffers from the Charm/Penitentiary curse! It received basically no promotion at all, despite APPARENTLY not being among the pirated garbage thrown together which they typically release. Case and point being, you look through my reviews, I'm pretty much up on these things and nearly 6 months I'm just learning of this one being released. Also you can find 2 different titles for the album depending on where you look, either Nah Sell Out or Born For This, they apparently never decided what the name would be, and I've actually seen printed copies with Born for This on the cover. And that really is a shame because when an artist has as much work out and obviously is so easily saleable to reggae fans, all you need to do is make them aware of it, which Charm, in this case, never attempted to do.But to the good, there are 14 tracks her and 14 winners. The champion of those winners is without a doubt one of the 2 title tracks, Nah Sell Out. Nah Sell Out is a track probably better suited to become the sequel to his biggest hit, Notorious, even moreso than the one he ultimately wrote for that role. Its a well powerful tune, it even has the electric feel to it which the original Notorious did as well. Nah Sell Out also receives a complete Acapella version at the end of the album.Not surprisingly the second best tune here is the other ttle track (at least they struggled between the 2 best songs) Born For This. The tune is one of his more popular songs from his live act so I'm definitely happy to see it on an album (now if I can just get On My Way to Zion on one!). Other top tunes include the laid back inspiration of Brighter Day, the overall clever one drop of Firm which follows the similar vibe to a song from the Notorious album, Nah Run.I also really enjoy Motherless Fatherless of course reminiscent of the vibes of Mamma Is There, one of his first hits. Check the mighty Child of Melchezidek in a chat stylee just nicely done and the Vendetta played Don't Waste My Time.Overall, this is easily one of the artist's best albums, which is a shame because you'd never really know that to be the case because so few people know about this record. I myself ran across looking for another new album which he has released. Fans of the artist, unfortunately you may need to check this one out, because beginning to end it is one of his better pieces and if you've been paying attentino this far, you know that's saying something. Definitely Nah Sell Out or Born for This is one to keep and eye out for.

Even more so, perhaps, than my beloved dancehall and my ever-loved soca, the ARTFORM of making nice roots reggae music CONSISTENTLY is one which has proven and continues to prove to be a quite elusive skill. In the dancehall, it almost seems that a SINGLE big riddim can get a producer over and allow him/her to make their name on a larger level, ultimately leading to future works; in the roots scene, things are different. I can't even begin to tell you how many BIG riddims I've heard from virtually nameless producers who will NEVER make another piece. The same things go for labels, reggae labels seemingly come and go on an almost monthly basis and the majority of these (ESPECIALLY on the international scene) are labels which specialize in roots reggae music (I'm sitting here trying to think of a nice active international dancehall specific label and I'm not too sure about it). In Jamaica, of course things are different, as he labels here, REGARDLESS of their initial strength tend to either stick around a little longer, or at the very least, at their end, they tend to lead into other labels and other recording possibilities for producers, yet, with as much literal competition there is, as I said, you REALLY have to do something special to differentiate and separate yourself from the rest of the pack these days. Also, it is worth mentioning that, despite the fact that it is definitely harder to build a name, the roots arena of producers get new and newer names almost everyday. Of the names currently riding at the top of the game, it isn't exactly a crowded bunch. The current man of the moment with the `Midas Touch' seems to be legendary musician/producer/arranger/artist/engineer Dean Fraser who followed a 2007 which saw him introducing potential future roots reggae superstars Duane Stephenson and, of course, new roots poster boy Tarrus Riley; with a 2008 which saw him leading the cause for not only longtime associate, the legendary `Messenjah' Luciano (dating back to the time when Fraser ran the music side of the LANDMARK Xterminator imprint) on his STRONG Jah Is My Navigator project; likewise Fraser also had a hand in delivering STERLING roots princess Etana to the world as well. There's also, surprisingly, Della Drummond from Danger Zone who has been pushing out VERY nice pieces recently to support his star studded group of artists. And there are the likes of Don Corleone and Arif Cooper, who don't really specialize in roots, but seem to have mastered both it and dancehall equally well and can offer hits CONSISTENTLY from either side. And of course Bobby Digital. I would also be doing a disservice were I not to mention names like `Tippy' Alfred, Tuff Lion and Batch from out of the Virgin Islands reggae. And a few international labels as well (Lustre Kings, Maximum Sounds, Pow Pow, IM Music and the likes).However, without a doubt, the most consistent OBVIOUS roots specialized producer over the last year or so, has been Kemar `Flava' McGregor of No Doubt Records. McGregor, in my opinion, has been doing the EXACT same thing for roots reggae in Jamaica that Stephen `Di Genius' McGregor (no relation) has been doing in the dancehall: Helping to make a MODERN class of parameters by which I think the music will ultimately come to be defined in this era. If you have achieved ANY semblance of respect in the roots arena in the modern landscape of reggae in Jamaica, Flava has worked with you! Besides just WORKING with the names, the man (still very young at just 27), has produced full blown albums for the likes of Sizzla, Luciano, Turbulence, Anthony B and even Gyptian, and has proven, in his short time in the game to be one of the most CONSISTENT producers in the game as he hurriedly builds No Doubt into a household name of talents. Flava's style and what I think has REALLY attracted the great deal of attention and success that he has had so far, can be best described as FRESH. McGregor doesn't necessarily have a `static' type of vibes, they ALWAYS change, but its always something so very fresh and original and unique, but something which more than somewhat remains well within the scope of modern roots reggae. He has also been quite active, personally in releasing albums for his riddims which have generally all been well solidly received and respectable, being highlighted by his original piece (if I remember correctly) the DIVINE Triumphant Riddim released by Greensleeves. He has also had his 83 Riddim released through Greensleeves, recently made his VP Riddim Driven debut with his very popular Rub-A-Dub (which featured a big bag of VP artists) and his most recent release; the Drop It riddim which is now out through Tad's Riddim Ruller series. In between those high profile projects, Flava has also maintained quite a consistent schedule with lower scaled pieces, the lion's share of which have been released by Donville Davis' young, yet ULTRA consistent UK based Cousin's Records. Cousins happens to be the route taken for this particular riddim, McGregor's immaculate Flute riddim as an early entry of the label's continuing Ride the Riddim series (although they dropped the ball on the Drop It Riddim DEFINITELY). The Flute riddim was a piece which was a bit less hyped than some of McGregor's other pieces at the time and has all but come and gone by comparison, but when you REALLY take a listen, I would argue that it ranks amongst the most wonderfully COMPOSED of all of his riddims to date. It doesn't quite reach the stratosphere of the Triumphant (if he ever does approach that level again, McGregor's career would pretty fulfilled and he could enter retirement a bonafide modern legend at that point) and doesn't have some of the flares of his other pieces, but you'd be hard pressed to find such a CLEAN and FRESH sound. As the riddim reaches album form it is highlighted by some equally fresh performances by some of the bigger and up and coming names in the game. Exactly what you have come to expect from McGregor and No Doubt.The Flute was one of three virtually simultaneously released riddims from Kemar McGregor for Cousin's Ride the Riddim series. The other two were the solid Key riddim and the Trumpet riddim. The Key was a VERY bubbly and fresh piece which featured a very similar line up to the Flute's roster of artists; and the Trumpet was another of Flava's high profile pieces as it served as the backdrop for official No Doubt artist Nesbeth's big breakout tune, Boardhouse. Getting things started on the Flute riddim album is constant McGregor favourite, Gyptian with the slightly odd What Are We Fighting For? The tune isn't at all one of my favourites on the riddim as it find Gyptian, as is his tendency showing some of the inconsistency which has plagued him through his young career. The tune isn't completely a lost however, I do like the message, of course, it just doesn't really do anything particularly special on the riddim and pretty much comes and goes in its time. Next up is the completely more fulfilling Food from singer Chezidek. The (ST. ANNZ!) artist has already proven himself quite comfortable over McGregor's compositions having had his very nice 2007 album, Firm Up Yourself produced by Flava. Food is a tune that has REALLY grown on me, the first few times I heard it I don't even think I really listened to it too well at all, but upon further review, it is DIVINE! The tune is my absolute pick of the riddim as, not surprisingly, the impeccably voiced Chezidek flows like water through the dizzying Flute armed with a wonderful vibes and a message hitting deep for the conscience. BIG tune! Finishing out the opening for the Flute riddim album and doing an excellent job of it is reggae superstar, Luciano with his very uplifting More Love. It was quite an interesting vibes which developed in listening to the album straight through as you hear the change from the frail voiced Chezidek to the LUSH baritone of the Messenjah. More Love is typical on point Luciano as he offers a VERY simple, yet equally as fitting and applicable answer to many of the worlds ills: More Love. Very fine way to get things started with three of the bigger names voicing the riddim and (at least two of them) doing a very nice job of it.There are some really nice names throughout the Flute riddim. However, besides Luciano and Anthony B, McGregor doesn't really tap the top of the top names in the genre, instead, he opted to build the vibes with solid roots talents, most of whom do a very good job and make his decision work out quite well. One of the two exceptions (and the only to do well) to that is veteran singer Lukie D who chimes in with his WONDERFUL anti-violence anthem I Want to Know. The Kingston singer really offers a wonderful vibes on the tune which has gone on to become one of my favourite of his career (and he is NOWHERE near being one of my most beloved artists at all) so definitely don't skip it, as you might tend to on a riddim like such, the tune is so nice. Two of these tunes I had already heard actually (although it took me quite awhile recall exactly where) Anthony B's Too High as well as Jah Mason's Take Me Where. Both are easily amongst the finest efforts on the Flute altogether. Too High is a tune which was featured on the underrated McGregor produced album, Confused Times from 2005 and was one of the sweetest tunes on that badly planned but well carried out album. Bobo's somewhat unusual chorus is probably the most memorable on the album as he pitches a nice anti-violence message. For his part, the Mason offers a VERY nice piece which captured my attention on some pirated compilation which I won't bother to mention, but the song is so sweet. It reminds me, message-wise of an older tune he did named All I Can See (Unlimited album) where he is basically asking to be returned to the more simple and less `agitated' way of life. The tune only occasionally features the Mason in his more aggressive state and the result is one sweet sweet bag of vibes and definitely one of the highlights of the riddim altogether. Of course I have to mention Lutan Fyah's Suffering Us, which is FAR from his absolute best, but still goe sto show the real strength of this artist as he pushes a HEAVY message and very nice track with his B-level vibes! Definitely check the tune. Two artists I was very happy to see come in later on the riddim with Chrisinti and Natty King. Where the King has voiced a few McGregor riddims (including the Trumpet and the Triumphant); at least to my knowledge, this is the first time the ace producer has linked with the veteran BIG voiced singer Chrisinti on his stirring Guess What. The singer has a rootical vibes which, in my opinion, just are able to meld themselves VERY well with any modern set up (and pretty much any old school as well) and No Doubt is No Exception. The tune is just BIG and inspiring vibes which is, I think largely due to his wonderful voice, a penchant for the Drewsland native. And Natty King delivers a real winner with his very nice (albeit quite generic) No More War. Despite his lack of a hit for quite awhile now, Natty King is REALLY becoming one of the real names that I look for when a new big roots riddim reaches. His presence on a piece is always an addition and the Flute is no different. The last GOOD vocal performance on the Flute riddim album is by constant Flava spar, Prestige (although he has been uncharacteristically absent from the last few riddims), with his pretty nice Feeling Inside (and Prestige continues to impress, currently riding high with a nice tune for out Olympic athletes as well as a very nice piece named My Pride). The piece is, at its core, simply a nice lover's piece and, as he ALWAYS does, Prestige just seems to have an `advantage' over who else voices the riddim as he constantly pushes his best vibes over McGregor's compositions. It is also worth mentioning that veterans Perfect, Nicky B and ESPECIALLY Turbulence ALL miss the mark with their offerings, respectively. And the album ends with a very nice clean version of the Flute riddim which really shows off the small idiosyncrasies and subtleties of the riddim, including Flava's trademark; the very nice nyah drum which is the only literal musical aspect which is always present on his compositions and (unlike the Trumpet, which had no trumpet) an actual nice usage of a flute. And I always love to see the clean riddim version included on the album, definitely.Overall, what you have in the Flute riddim is fairly typical top notch Kemar McGregor production. The producer more than adequately does his job as he generates one of the downright COOLEST riddims I've heard in quite awhile. The artists' performances are not always the most consistent or always the best (even, such as the case of Lutan Fyah, when they're very good still), which is what I think ultimately kept the riddim from reaching the stratosphere of some of its more well known `siblings'. However, should you ever want to REALLY indoctrinate yourself in the vibes of modern roots reggae, you can just pick up a bag of whichever riddim is out at the time from No Doubt. And should you just want to sit back and your chair and put up your feet and relax and meditate, you might want to pick up the Flute riddim first.

With the seeminglessly neverending 'battle' between reggae record labels to sack up the latest and hottest riddims from Jamaica its rather odd to see a truly big riddim go without an album for any decent length of time these days. The rate at which riddim or 'version' albums are released in this era of reggae and particularly dancehall is astounding, particularly between the 'big 3' of reggae labels (VP, Greensleeves and JetStar). So how does one of the biggest dancehall riddims of the past decade, by one of the best producer the genre has ever seen, which birthed one of the biggest tunes of the genre of the past few years go without an album for well over a year?The answer may lie with the rather shrewd business practices of dancehall super-producer Dave Kelly both in and out of the studio. Kelly's MASSIVE 85 Riddim of the summer of '05 proved to be one of the biggest riddims of the producer's career for his label, Madhouse(AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT). The riddim is STILL played here virtually daily on the radio stations, and it also birthed an international hit which is definitely the single biggest hit for the Madhouse label ever!Kelly has also stood himself apart from other dancehall producers. He and his brother Tony pretty much march to the beat of their own drummer. While current dancehall production royalty such as Vendetta, Scatta and Lenky will sale their riddims to the VP's, the Greensleeves' and the JetStar's (and generally, their publishing as well), the Kelly's will take their time and let the riddim brew for a good while before taking it to an international album.Kelly also keeps preserves riddims' exclusivity, by not reaching for the who's who of artists to voice his riddims, only Madhouse signed artists and his own personal favorites at the moment get to ride some of the biggest and most inventive dancehall riddims Jamaica has to offer.So by now you may know that the biggest tune here is without a doubt (Baby) Cham's MASSIVE Ghetto Story. The song fulfilled the promise which Kelly and Cham had been telling dancehall fans for years that ultimately they would 'crossover' internationally without selling out. That is exactly what they did, and even though I'm long tired of Ghetto Story, I have to admit that it makes almost perfect usage of the old school supersonic of a riddim that is the 85. In the past, both had been questioned as to what was becomming of Cham's career, with his inactivity and apparent unwillingness to voice riddims that weren't Madhouse, but Ghetto Story ended that for the first artist EVER signed to Madhouse.So we have to give Kelly the benefit of the doubt with his other artist. Lady Spice originally made her name as a lyrical sparring partner of Elephant Man in a rather short clash between the two which she came out of a better artist (and probably the winner). Kelly signed the short dynamo and fed her some of his finest pieces and Spice shines without a doubt. Her two 85 efforts, the slack Fight Over Man and the even slacker Grab Yuh Hood, are amongst the best work of her entire career, with Fight Over Man probably being her best overall (although I still get a laugh listening to The Robbing).The balance of the 85 is made up of another Cham tune, a combination with Majic Massey, Bring It On, another stellar effort from the rock voiced dj; and Kelly's favorite artists. Kelly has had a part in resurrecting one dancehall greatest singers in the legendary Pinchers. Pinchers' tune here, Desperate Scenario even rivals some of the best material of his storied career as he remains the preferred singer of the label. Also definitely check King Yellowma, making a surprise appearance on the 85 with his well solid Orphan and Assassin absolutely BLAZING the riddim with his Anywhere We Go which definitely rivals Ghetto Story for the top honors here.The album finishes with just four tracks from Kelly's latest riddim the Stage Show riddim (not to be confused with the riddim which backed Sizzla's hit Stage Show from 2002). The Stage Show is almost a 'younger' sounding version of the Madhouse. The bouncy riddim only gets 4 tracks with the standout definitely being Assassin's Good Over Evil. 'Sassin typically records for his manager, Donovan Germain from Penthouse, who just happens to be Kelly's mentor, however, he rides his producer's protege's pieces just as well, Good Over Evil is MASSIVE! Also definitely have to recommend the combination between inchers and Lady Spice, Rude Bwoy love. The hook on the tune is the best on the riddim and the 2 record well together with excellent chemistry making Rude Bwoy Love another big big track.Overall, the relatively short 12 track album almost goes as quickly as it came. Checking in at just over 45 minutes shows both Kelly's unwillingness to do overdo his material as well as VP's unwillingness to wait for it. The 85 riddim was a truly huge riddim and fittingly it has finally taken its place on its album. The interest here is almost a 'what could have been' type of an interest. I wonder what this artist or that artist would have sounded like on the riddim (particularly Beenie Man, Kartel and Ce'cile) but what Kelly did assemble works! Throw in the Stage Show and you more than have my seal of recommendation.

I might have to give this album, the album for the Throwback Giggy Riddim by artists/producers Left Side and Esco a pass. Two things which you look for on riddim (Or 'version') albums are always: Consistent performances by all (or at least most) of the artists voicing on the riddim and a variation of the riddim by the producer/s giving each tune a life of its own.The Throwback Giggy has absolutely neither of those things. There are some truly terrible performances over the TG. The nice named but poor sounding Rock Supreme fails miserably on Rebirth of a Classic in a NYC style which doesn't quite make it and stops somewhere around Memphis, as does Colly C on Look Good, Cook Good. I'm (as usual) not too fond of Bling Dawg's offering, Mi Life Style, even Buju doesn't put his best foot forward on his Me Too Bad, and I just don't know what Future Troubles was going for on his Forget About It.AND! The Throwback Giggy doesn't change one time, it is what it is throughout all 15 tracks on the album.HOWEVER! What the Throwback Giggy is, is just fine. The riddim is an neo-oldschool sounding dancehall powerhouse, and when used effectively, the results flow as smooth as liquid. Arguably, the best tune here is Ce'cile's very fine Hot Like That, which was the first tune that I actually heard on the Giggy, she uses the riddim perhaps most effectively and mixes her usual dj and pure singing style very nice. The hit here was of course the producers themselves on the hilarious Tuck in U Belly, throwing it up for the slim women of JA, one what was (and might still be) a #1 tune back home.Besides them, Elephant Man (who I can never really call myself a 'fan' of) scores on the slack Play Hard Fi Get (the hook is hilarious on that tune). And surprisingly, New Kidz score quite well on A So We Drop It, as does singer Shanique on If Ever You Go.But getting back to the slackness, a wonderful selection by the producers for the Giggy is Roundhead, who digs his claws into the riddim which is right up his alley on his Marathon Run, probably his best offering in a good while. Roundhead was literally made to ride these types of riddims and the new popularity of this style might actually birth a solo album for the vet (FINALLY!). Also, Vybz Kartel tears through, as expected, on the seriously slack Tight (u know what) Gal Dem, at the beginning of which the artist throws it up for that early 90's dancehall vibe which the Giggy sets forth. The lyrics on the tune go from impressive, to flat out funny on an excellent tune for Kartel.Also, buried at #14 on the album is a young artist named Calico who ever-continues to impress. And his Link Up is one of his best ever as he just flat out locks the flow and murders it!Overall, as I mentioned the negatives about the album the Throwback Giggy itself is just about flawless and easily one of the best pure dancehall riddims of the year and show total promise for its architects. I was perhaps most disappointed that a version of the riddim itself wasn't on the album without the voicing. Nevertheless, if you TRULY enjoy dancehall, the Throwback Giggy just might be the best choice in riddims for you in 2005.

Critics of modern dancehall are quick to point the finger at several rather large and overlying issues in the dance which signal the `changing of the times' of dancehall. The three largest of these issues are slackness in the dancehall, the actual arguments and public disagreements between the artists and musicians themselves and lastly the obvious shift of overall violence within the music. As the rootical side of the music seems to get more and more pure and back to the vibes where it originated, dancehall, at least according to the critics, has taken a turn for the worse from which will take years to recover. The usual faces of sorts who have made these warnings come about were the typical names Beenie Man and Bounty Killer's seemingly never ending war to the finish; Ninjaman and Mad Cobra, two ultra determined holdovers from the ever so SLIGHTLY less violent era of dancehall just preceding this current one and names like Spragga Benz and Lady Saw who took slackness to a level of which even the late `Slackest DJ' General Echo would be proud. Then came Vybz Kartel, an artist who in himself would push all warning stages to the point of critical mass. Having spent his `developmental period' as a writer for his then mentor Bounty Killer, when the spotlight began to shine on Kartel himself, Jamaica realized it had literally stumbled upon one of its most controversial, yet undeniably most talented champions of all time. Kartel's equally downright odd and downright genius style produced hit after hit and having linked with some of the just as genius young names in dancehall production and the young Portmore native had a claim to being not only one of the undeniably most powerful artists in Jamaica, but one of the most powerful people overall. His music was all three issues to an exaggerated degree; not only could he turn songs like Why You Doing It with Wayne Marshall and Tekk both of which became MASSIVE Jamaican hits; he could be equally `successful' with tunes like Gun Clown, Like Nuttn and Gunz Like Mine all more violent that the one before; Kartel also proved to be a handful for his peers, taking small swipes at some of the biggest names in the business like Beenie Man, (AT THE TIME) Merciless and Assassin, he would eventually declare full blown war on Spragga Benz, infamously Ninjaman and even his own mentor, Bounty Killer. Armed with one of the craziest flows all of music has ever seen and a bag of lyrics which has no bottom, he proved himself able to belong with the legends. In his short time at the forefront of the music, Kartel has not only developed himself into a dominant force in the dancehall, he has, like Ninja and Bounty Killer (I think there's some Papa San and Madd Anju in there as well) inspired him; inspired his own group of young artists, most notably the most likely choices for the next ruling DJ's Aidonia (who you can very well expect a similar styled review from on his debut album later this year/early 08) and Busy Signal (check Bramma too). Also in the mix came a very unusual talent who, unlike his most immediate predecessor, Wayne Marshall, as THE dancehall singer of choice lacked the `dance' part of dancehall and seemed bent on turning the music into his own personal war zone, going as far as taking on Kartel himself.Enter Mavado. If Bounty Killer were a singer, he would probably be a BETTER HUMOURED version of Mavado (which is saying a lot, I know bricks with more humor than the Killa). Mavado relatively slowly exploded on the scene in 2005-2006 to the point which, at the end of 2006 he had even began to outshine regular sparring partner Busy Signal in the midst of his own debut album release. Thus began a MAMMOTH (in terms of dancehall) bidding war for the services of the young Cassava Piece native singer who through his various hits had attracted more attention than any dancehall singer I can remember. Having found a home with excellent young Kingston production house, Daseca whose style of producing almost over hard yet still highly infectious dancehall riddims fitted the `fast singing' style of Mavado (he, at times, almost comes off as a DJ who hangs on words a little longer) perfectly. When Mavado actually reached the masses and revealed his style (save for a few bits here and there, one of which was a tune over the strange Middle East riddim name Bawl, which oddly enough was the b-side to Kartel`s Dandy Shandy), he was initially not too well received with listeners not knowing what to make of the singer who sung about guns and guns, and guns and guns! While there have been artists who had `specialties' before, most notably, one of Mavado's own mentors in Bounty Killer who took the art of the `gun tune', destroyed it and rebuilt it from the ground up; the late General Echo who could DJ without ending on the subject of sex and sex and sex and others still like Lady Saw's own brilliance with the slack tune, King Yellowman's seemingly never ending infatuation with. . . King Yellowman and to a lesser degree underrated but wicked DJ Round Head's crazy ability to turn nearly ANY subject ultimately into his own favorite subject, ganja; arguably NO ONE has ever `represented' for the overall viciously violent tune like Mavado. Mavado's almost blind obsession with the gun almost mirrors Round Head's ganja affection and Yellowman's affection for Yellowman in that, in never matters what he's singing about, it will almost ALWAYS turn into a discussion of the gun. His style is not at all similar to that of predecessors Killa, Cobra or Ninja in that, he doesn't (usually) harp solely about his own proficiency with the gun, he will relate a story, he will tell of someone else's abilities and break it down to a shocking level of detail the military would be impressed by. Perhaps even to the deficiency of other areas of tunes; he hasn't (at least not as yet) shown the ability to score with the big lover's tune which singers normally add very early to their arsenal, his fans, however, have shown nary a care for Mavado's one track mind as when the gates of hits from the singer opened , after the brief hesitation period I mention, they have hung on nearly every word. His initial signature tunes, Real McKoy and the wicked combination Full Clip with Busy Signal (both over Daseca's Anger Management riddim, with the latter coming over a slightly amplified version, the Angrier Management), both became MASSIVE hits and rarely is a Mavado stage show which still doesn't include both sets in some form. The critics, meanwhile, had (and are still having) a literal trip with Mavado's rise to prominence with some going as far as to mark the singer's rise to prominence with an overall shift, not only in dancehall and all reggae music, but with Jamaican life as a whole, pointing to his bloody war with Kartel which left the studio and the dancehall altogether and reached the streets.Strictly musically speaking, there is no denying the talents of Mavado, thus there was no surprise when the largest reggae label in the world, VP announced in March of 2007 that they had reached a deal with Mavado for his debut album to be released this summer appropriately entitled after his signature call, Gangster For Life. Having missed the boat previously with raw talents like Kartel and Busy (and in thus, at least to some, seemingly kept there image to the more playful and artful side of the music with their current dancehall signees including names like Sean Paul and Elephant Man (both duel deals with majors), Wayne Wonder and the recently departed Lady Saw showing that and only Assassin who plays both roles equally well and very recently the signing of Bounty Killer representing the more aggressive side of the music), VP apparently went all out for Mavado's services and signed the singer to a multiple album deal. The first product of the deal is here and arguably the most anticipated dancehall album of the year, Gangster For Life: The Symphony of David Brooks reaches shelves and is expected to do very large things for the artist and label alike. There are very few surprises with GangstaFor Life, it actually reminds me a great deal of Sean Paul's debut with VP, 2000's Stage One (still one of my favorite dancehall albums! I don't care!) which was built largely on the tracks on which the artist had made his name. The exactly same number of tracks, 25 comprised Stage One and seemingly to give it a new feel, several interludes or `skits' were included (Mavado actually tops reggae`s king of skits Sean Paul with an almost laborious nine to seven. ) and the album was with very few high profile combinations, instead, choosing to basically introduce the international world to the artist, and you see what happened in the case of Sean Paul (although with Mavado's style and personality, he has one which almost uniquely Jamaican and I'm not expecting that type of crossover for him, and he probably couldn't care less) . Gangster For Life is very solid introduction to one of the most noteworthy young talents the dancehall has ever seen. As I said, there are very few surprises, and one who is not actually a fan or even know the name Mavado could probably garner much of the vibes just from glancing at the cover.Though the viciously violent tracks on GFL permeate and dominate the album, the track here which is my choice for the best on the album and the obvious standout is definitely Sadness. Sadness is a track dedicated to Mavado's slain father and a very very nice track over a well powerful Bobby Digital one drop and Mavado shows no deficiency in adapting his normal style to the vibes and actually in the end, it would be hard for me not to be overly impressed with Sadness coming from an artist who made his name in such a different vibes, producing a song which one could only think that his father is equally impressed with. Sadness is top notch! As a mentioned, Mavado's style is so geared towards the violent and aggressive, thus, he can sing (and about his SINGING, Mavado has a nice singing voice, a nice range, although he almost rarely taps it out, and though he won't be mentioned alongside the Wayne Wonders and Sanchez's and Da'Ville's of the dancehall world, he probably could actually fit in there quite comfortably) songs which aren't exactly sounding violent, but you analyze the lyrics, and they are every bit as violent as his more obtrusively harsh tracks. Such a song scores easily as one of the best on GFL and one of the best of his Mavado's career, Dying. Built over a very nice Daseca riddim of the same name, Dying, which features more typical singer, `Serani' (who is actually Craig Marsh, who owns Daseca), could on sound alone probably fit on the R&B; side even, but it's a very very powerfully violent song when you actually analyze it and its subtleness actually pushes it to a higher level and its very strong. Also, along similar lines check previous single Dreaming, over Daseca's highly addictive riddim of the same name (which VP released as part of their Riddim Driven series earlier this year, definitely check that out as well), definitely one of the stronger tracks on GFL; even stronger still is the track immediately following Dreaming, is Don't Cry (which flows over a stripped down version of the Dreaming riddim, without the horns). Don't Cry is a track for Mavado's mother which at times doesn't sound like such, but overall is a grim reminder to his mother to "Even if dem kill me, don't cry!"For the `darker' side of GFL which pulls no punches and lays everything to be seen in the open, it is actually here where Mavado's greatest attentions and efforts have gone (although I'm expecting as he matures his writing to drift almost exclusively to the more subtle, kind of like Assassin's has) thus far. And say what you will, critique what you must, some of that material is flat out brilliance! Although VP was obliged to include both Real McKoy and Full Clip (the only official combination here) in medley form, that vibes reaches its point on the undeniably MASSIVE Amazing Grace. It would take someone along the lines of Mavado to take the term `Amazing Grace' and turn it into a song so incredibly violent as the punch line goes, "Amazing Grace, shot fly through face!". Built over young `Genius' Stephen McGregor's epic Tremor riddim, Amazing Grace is a colorful example of what many people love about Mavado's vibes and what just as many think is wrong. The Genius proves to be quite and accompanying force to Mavado's harsher vibes as he also is helm for previous singles the LARGE Weh Dem a Do (one of the better tunes here) on his Red Bull & Guiness and the Kartel aimed Top Shatta Nah Miss over his epochal Powercut Riddim (missing still are both the almost comically violent How High and obviously from better times, the Kartel combination Rise, both Genius productions with the Ghetto Whiskey and 12 Gauge riddims respectively). Also check the very strong Gully Side over Firelinks' Air Waves riddim and the very addictive Last Night over the pounding Show Off riddim.The only real and obvious complaint here is that Mavado has focused so much of his time creating his vibes on his favorite subject, he has perhaps done so to the detriment of other areas (which was also a critique thrown at Kartel all the way up until the last 2 years or so). Thus, songs like Heartbeat (which features songbird Alaine!) and ESPECIALLY Squeeze Breast (which Mavado almost IMMEDIATELY turns into a half slack/half violent vibes) come off as downright weird! But his versatility should come ultimately with time.Overall, Mavado's debut album Gangsta For Life: The Symphony of David Brooks is very solid, particularly for a dancehall debut (and album overall for that matter). Dancehall releases from the genre's TOP NOTCH acts are becoming scarce and scarcer over the past few years with much of those acts seeking exclusive deals (whereas roots artist have the more `have vibes, will travel' approach) and Mavado's debut ranks very highly. I will say that this one is strictly for the dancehall heads, who really don't need me to tell them that, newer fans, DEFINITELY check out some samples before you pick this one up. Gangsta For Life is the debut album for an artist all of reggae need keep their eyes on, for in the future, Mavado may be one of the greats.

Track List:1. We've Been Together2. Beautiful Eyes3. Mek a Lot of Doe4. Oh Yes Baby5. Can't Touch Mi Turf6. Out Di Way7. Black Woman Showoff8. Real (The Live Feel)9. Wha Dat10. Judgment11. All the Best12. Mek a Lot A Doe (remix)13. Instrumental14. InstrumentalThis apparently ultra hard to find, downright mysterious piece was to be released originally the same day as recent Sizzla gem of an album Da Real Thing, then delayed 2 weeks, then delayed indefinitely, only to be released early in 2003 without an official release date by 2b1 records worldwide.The thing that i most want to say about this record is that, having heard a TON of Sizzla's music, including cutouts and studio and out freestyle's this album sounds like an entire freestyle album. I have heard some of tunes before, but they do appear to be redone (Judgment). The best tune is far and away past Sizzla hit Real, given the live treatment on Up In Fire, i also like Out Di Way, Black Woman Showoff and Can't Touch Mi Turf. The entire album has more of a dancehall feel, so if your first experience of Sizzla Kalonji was the Da Real Thing Album, you might not want to make your second one Up In Fire (try Kalonji or Freedom Cry for something more along those lines). Overall, i do actually think this one is a freestyle album for the most part and it's absolutely nowhere near the man's best, it could be called Not Da Real Thing lol. Of course if you're a fan of Sizzla's especially his more dancehall tunes, then pick this one up, not too dissimilar to other recent release Light of My World by Sizzla, who can't seem to make enough albums in a year.P.S. Also like Light of My World, there's a very interesting article on the artist in the liner notes.

Yami Bolo is easily one of the most overlooked and underrated singers in all of reggae music. While staying on the road and in the studio, constantly recording, he has yet to reach the heights of such well known roots singers as Luciano, Bushman and Everton Blender. His style is one that is so unique and different, although somewhat similar in sound to Michael Rose (himself, unique and different), in the somewhat unearthly wailing voice which would work in no other genre than reggae, however, in reggae, it works perfectly! So unusual is the style that you'll generally find people on opposite ends in the discussion their opinions regarding his music. Either you like Yami Bolo's music, or you don't.One thing that is not up for question is that he has been a fine addition to the roots reggae scene since he entered the business. Making friends along the way such as The Marley Family, the Xterminator family and a host of others, Bolo has established himself as one of the preferred combination singers for some of the finest talent Jamaica has to offer. So it was no surprise when this album, Ministry, was released due to Bolo's prolificity in making combination tracks. Ministry is basically a greatest hits album of Bolo's greatest duets.Interestingly enough, the finest track that this album has to offer is the least of a combination it also has to offer. The truly beautiful Willow Tree which 'features' dancehall ace Bounty Killer stands as the finest track on the entire album. The song is built on an old school lovers rock one drop riddim and Bolo's chanting sounds exquisite through the balance of the track. Make no mention that after a brief intro of the song Bounty virtually disappears save for a snippet here and there.The biggest hit here was probably the most unlikely combination as well. After covering Bounty I suppose its only fair to cover his rival as well. Bolo links up with Clarendon dj (and currently missing man) Merciless on a cover of Junior Byles' classic Curly Locks. The combination works surprisingly well as Merciless takes a full verse as opposed to Bounty on and Byles should be proud as the duo takes a steady care of his hit.Othe tracks worth listening to definitely include the nice Culture Taking Over with legendary dancehall singer Johnny Osbourne. The track carries a wonderful message and ironically the subject of the song could generally be perscribed to reggae music as a whole and it is a well powerful tune, probably the lyrically most proficient of the entire album. Also check True Love with Sizzla Kalonji(speaking of lyrically proficient). True Love is a remake of the White Mice hit of the same title and it is a definite highlight of Ministry. Sizzla has made combinations with some of the finest artists in the business and this tune is without a doubt one of his finest combinations as well.Also take in the vibes of the sweetest track on the album Love Jah Everyday with legendary singer Suagr Minott. The styles of the two work well together on the oh so 'I should have thought of that!' style combination, as Minott is actually Bolo's mentor. Lastly, vibe on Put Down Your Weapons with Capleton. The track might actually be my third favorite on the album overall (after Willow Tree & Curly Locks). With older material as well as newer vibes with the Lustre Kings camp, Capleton might be Bolo's most regular spar and each time they hook up its worth a spin and the nice melody as well as the message, of course, make Put Down Your Weapons absolutely no exception.Overall, while I wouldn't issue a full blown recommendation of Ministry to anyone, it is a well solid album. This one is to be appreciated by fans of Bolo's ONLY. Its not necessarily a nice place to start for newer fans (for you I'd suggest 1998's Jah Love), this one is strictly for the initiated. If you are such, then definitely check this one out, although you may know most, if not all, of the material already, its still always interesting see how your favorite artist would sound with HIS favorite artists.

When Sizzla Kalonji really tries to make good music, in my opinion their is no one better in reggae music, lyrically he can be downright shocking and astonishing, the man truly has another level he can take it to. However, he has recieved a ton of criticism for changing his lyrics to everywhere in an 'experimental' phase even being ultra slack, and yelling often.That being said Da Real Thing is truly the real thing, this album is a flawless project which is what happens when Sizzla actually tries his talent takes over and effortlessly rides every Bobby Digital produced track to perfection and leaves the listener wanting more. Check the best tune on this record (which is hard to be on this excellent album) Thank You Mama which is vintage Sizzla and very well could have fit well on his opus Black Woman & Child, the totally mellow vibe he pushes throughout the record is just totally refreshing and such a far cry from albums such as Blaze Up the Chalwa (not a bad record) and Blaze Fire Blaze, he just rules the flow calmly and still gets the message across. Also check the ultra tight Solid as a Rock, Simplicity, Woman I Need You,Mash Dem Down, Rejoice, Why Should I? and Boom and Go Through, and I assure you that every tune i didn't mention is very good as well. I admit that I am very partial, Sizzla is my favourite artist, but I think this is the best album that I've heard this year (respect Warrior King).Is it Black Woman & Child? No. Nothing is, but even being one level down from that album is still a beautiful and perfect in its own way record. You should definitely go pick this up if you havent already, it somewhat reminds me of the Freedom Cry album with its vibe for some reason. AMAZING?

Track List:1. Shall Not Be Moved2. Harvest Time3. Let I In4. Naturally5. Heart Full of Love6. Right Vibes7. Organized Crime8. Zion High Keeper9. Can't Hear, Must Feel10. Break Free11. Only RastafariBased purely on the producers of this record alone, Phillip Burrell and Ossie Savarian, this one could not be a failure, no matter the artist/s. Chezidek is a very young and unknown Rastafari singer, and along with Turbulence, the future of Xterminator singers to follow Luciano. And while, as you would expect, his pen isn't as strong as it may eventually grow to become, he still has decent lyrics, and can definitely sing and ride a cultural Xterminator riddim. Unlike Turbulence and Kalongi, Chezidek is a pure singer, and rarely ever djays or chants in his tunes, but that isn't a bad thing at all. The best song here is the title cut, Harvest Time, on which Chezidek does djay a little, but the hook on Harvest Time is what makes the tune excellent. Also check Let I In, which takes about a minute to get going, but when it does, its a very powerful tune, and it probably is the best song that truly conveys Chezidek's overall message. Also like Only Rastafari (which is quite good, best uplifting lyrics, on the album) Shall Not Be Moved and Zion High Keeper. Overall, I say pick this one up, if you're a fan of people like Turbulence, Prince Malachi, Jah Cure and Ras Shiloh, as Chezidek has a very high and loud tone, and of course if you like Xterminator music, this one just might do it for you.Bigup VPrecords for introducing new talent, and giving chances to unknown artists.

This is quietly one of the best albums in it's entirety that I've heard this year. I've had less than a week, and it immediately, grew on me. I like the fact that its a compilation, but it doesn't do the normal thing that a lot of records of the same nature do, by drawing on the same artists over and over (Sizzla, Capleton, Luciano, Jr. Kelly and Anthony B are the usual ones)Culture Dem uses artists that I've never even heard of before, and I would consider myself a huge listener of reggae music. Artists like I Lue, Jah Marcus, King Shadrach, Mabrakat and Al Pancho were previously names that were foreign to me before I listened to the vibes on this record. And while I had heard of Lutan Fyah, I had never heard his work, and again, this album introduced me to him. Normally on albums like these, the best song by Sizzla is my favorite, as he is my absolute favorite artist, and anything he does I'll usually like, but this is different. Kalonji is certainly, in my opinion, the best artist on this album (respect Prophet and Anthony B), but the best tune on this one is not on of his 2 excellent pieces of work, the well done Worthy to be Praised and the fiery Crush Dem Out (which i was priviledged enough to see him perform at Sting 01). My favorite song on this one (okay maybe it is Crush Dem Out, but my unbiased favorite-) is The Sabbath by I Lue, with No More War by Lutan Fyah coming in as a close second. But the tune the Sabbath by I Lue is absolutely amazing, his cool and relaxed vocals ride the riddim perfectly and i will certainly be attentive to his future releases. Another artist that is very well represented on this one is Norris Man, I was never really a fan of his before I heard this one, but his two tunes on Culture Dem, the title track and the excellent Thunderous Sound show his true class. There are two artists that I think are going to eventually take over and take Rastafarian music and teachings to the next levels, one is present on this record with two very strong showings, Turbulence (the other is the extraordinary Warrior King)does amazing of course, on Gone With the Wind and even better on Bad in the Past. Take all of that, and throw in a truly wicked condemnation by the Prophet on Cyan Even See Dem, 2 very good track by Jah Mason, YAMI BOLO with the most underrated vocals in reggae today on War and Revolution, Mabrakat sounding a little like Anthony B on Herb Inspiration and doing so wth very good lyrics, Anthony B himself, a very old veteran on this one astonishingly, doing very good Youth Turn Gangsta; and did I mention that Love Dem Up by Jah Mason was truly wicked (I'm listening to it right now)and his Caring isnt bad at all either. Joy Bells by Al Pancho is very good too, and Nah Live Clean by the same artist is very good as well, not as good as Joy Bells, but still very good. King Shadrach with a very hip-hop sound on Rise My People, nice changeup on that one. And thats it! I mean, I'm so passionately happy with this one because I just basically stumbled upon it spent very little and I got this amazing album. Easily one of the top 3-5 reggae albums of the year released so far. This is the type of record that might gain new fans for Rastafarian music i believe. Its a very well presented package, the cover is a very interestingly drawn portrait of the artists on the album (the drawer got Anthony B, Norris Man and Jah Mason down perfectly, and he displays the Bobos very nicely, and they are overshadowed by the Prophet, by the Priest and by the King (Marcus Garvey, King Emmauel Charles Edwards VII, and the King of Kings (in Rastafarianism) Haile Selassie I). Also on the cover is a little message which tells exactly what it is &quot;An essential collection of conscious music&quot; I couldn't put it any better myself, but I just tried. Like I said, this is an excellent project, well done, couldn't ask for anymore. . . okay maybe a tune by Steve Machete but, much props and massive largeup to Lustre Kings Productions for putting out such high quality material, and if this is any indication to their motives and their future works, I will definitely keep picking up their efforts, because this one is truly divine.AMAZING!

Almost instantly the world of music becomes a much better place the second Luciano releases a new album. The vibes are always amongst the strongest of the year, and despite routinely releasing upwards of 4-5 albums a year, Luciano always seems to exercise a great deal of quality control on his albums. Combined with the fact that he is without a doubt the most consistent roots reggae singer of the last decade and one of the most classy, I always look forward to hearing a new Luciano album.Despite his immense popularity and inexhaustible recording level there never seems to be a bit of controversy surrounding the artist. No, he isn't given the proper attention which he should receive abroad, but here he is without a doubt one of the most popular artists Jamaica has ever seen. Just a cursory listen to his new album, Child of a King will perhaps tell you why: Nothing puts a strain on Luciano's music, and there is no strain at all in the super laid back, and very solid effort on Child of a King.This album has mighty big shoes to fill being the follow up to his last VP album, the massive Serious Times. And while not being as strong as that album, Child of a King does more than hold its on with an almost curiously strong vibe emanating from the top tracks here. Much of the production is done by Mr. Vegas' partner in crime Byron Murray for In the Streetz Records, one of the busiest producer in Jamaica right now having done tracks for nearly every major roots reggae release since the beginning of the summer and Luciano is rightly afforded some of the finest backing tracks available. Thus, had you been listening through that time, you'll hear some very familiar material redone to probably its greatest effect by Luciano.The best tune here is probably the title track, one listen and the reason why the album was named after that track in particular is quickly revealed. The song is not unlike many a Luciano song which exclaims the power and loyalty of His Imperial Majesty without going over the top or resorting to the yelling style of many of his peers, its like how you can define the Messenger's entire career; simple brilliance.Also check the opener, the acoustic Remember When , just another simple beautiful and lush sounding tune. Check the wonderful anti-violence Brother Man which should probably be the second single if anyone is paying attention, big big song; Definitely no Luciano album is complete without an herb song, Child of a King is blessed with the outstanding International Cannabis over the Free Life riddim; and Watch What You Doin' is probably my second favorite song on the album over the fine Street Swing riddim.Also, a few nice covers are here, standing out is the cover of Bob & Marcis's Young Gifted and Black, and it works very nicely for the Messenger of course. Also included is somewhat of a tip of VP's hat by including both This One is For the Leaders and Silver & Gold, both were released a little later than the Serious Times album, but Child of a King was originally expected for 2005.Overall, definitely pick up Child of a King, like most Luciano albums these days (and most of the past half decade or so) it is top notch. His voice is as clear and crisp as it has ever been, he's working with one of the best young producers in all of reggae and its a Luciano album! That should be enough to make you want it, the strong vibes on it will be enough to make you like it, definitely recommended!

It was my full belief that the next time we would hear from Buju Banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `Rasta Got Soul' album. The album which has still yet to arrive (and may never) was said to be along Buju's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `Til Shiloh. He even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album's first single, the `magical' Magic City. So the world was waiting to see just how much Soul the album had.However. Between then and now Buju has been going through so many events that this album, Too Bad, almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics. Forever, it seems that he is still living in the `Boom Bye Bye Curse', and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling, he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is Too Bad. The album has a severe kick to it, it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate' Assassin's Infiltrate from `05, in terms of style.The attraction here is actually the subject of `confusion'. While we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe, Buju hasn't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time. Thus, the DJ who was once the dancehall's main attraction stepping back into the fray isn't at all a bad thing. So fans who sit longing for the days of Stamina Daddy and Batty Rider are the one's who'll be happy and I can fit into that camp as well! But at the same time, Buju's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots, so now it is there where he will ultimately excel. However, with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims, you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again.The best tune here is probably the hard hard `Til It Bend. Til it Bend is serious serious rudey dancehall. The song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear, but I guarantee that is the song most Jamaican will pull up, Til it Bend is nice! Also check the wicked wicked Nothing, Who Have It?, the ultra clever Better Day and the nice Hey Boy over the Petty Thief riddim.However, my second favorite song here I would have to say would be the combination Don & Dupes with underrated dancehall singer Pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently, largely due to his connection with Madhouse head, Dave Kelly. Buju makes an attempt (for some reason) at the useless Wipeout riddim on Me & Unu and actually makes it work a little. Also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as Driver, which is easily one of the best tunes on the album.Overall, the thought alone, Buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is, this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans. While there is nothing here that I would call definitive roots reggae, this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of Buju's will find something they like. I would have like to have seen Buju have at least one Lenky riddim on the album, a Wayne Wonder combination (although Pinchers subs just fine) and definitely the massive song Beauty Queen from the Twice Again riddim would have fit just fine here, but nevertheless, what you do have: High quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and Too Bad, over both what Beenie and Baby Cham have done, is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date, and a boomshot in the arm for the genre.

While artists like Bob Marley, Dennis Brown and Peter Tosh had their musical catalogues virtually inundated with live performance albums, the live genre of reggae music has been all but barren. Certain modern artists such as Luciano, Everton Blender and Anthony B have had live albums, however, you would think with the extreme prolificity of some of the top artists, there would be a live album almost every year from most of these acts. The live album in dancehall has NEVER been really examined to see if it might work save for a feeble few attempts and many of the ones which were released received little to no promotion (such as the live albums of such artists as Capleton, Mark Wonder & Prince Theo and Cocoa Tea as well.Thus, I look forward to virtually each and every live album which may come down the road with a release date of after the year 2000. In 2002, Bushman had his first (and to date only) live album released by well received roots label, King of Kings, and the world became a better place because of it! The show was taped in Toronto's Opera House (where I have been before, and is still open), and Bushman wasn't even the main performer (that distinction belonged to Anthony B) but he nearly stole the show! Checking in at a whopping one hour and thirteen minutes for an opening act, Bushman slowly builds the vibes culminating into an absolutely brilliant performance about midway through this album.Definitely check the nice story in the liners. The album, compiled and recorded by a bredrin named Hawkes (who also has a radio show in Toronto) was originally going to be from a show involving Anthony B., Norrisman and Bushman opening the set, however, Norrisman didn't show up and Bushman wowed the audience with his Grassroots Band (whom he still performs with to this day and is even more polished with now).Like many a stage show, this one takes a little while to get going, the first few tracks aren't the top of Bushman's ability, so you notice little things, like the mumbling chorus on Nyah Man Chant (which he still performs well). However, full on near track 4, Grow Yuh Natty, a MASSIVE song. The mumble is replaced with the typically deep, baritone wail that we're used to from the artist, but the vocals are crystal clear over Jammy's legendary Heavenless riddim, and you see the audience finally starting to get into and appreciating the vibes.Tracks 4~14 basically are wonderful! While I, as a big fan, sat there listening wondering why he didn't perform some of my favorites (and then sat there even longer trying to decipher exactly when this particular show was recorded, versus when my the tunes were recorded), there came a point in those tracks when I just stopped caring! The vibes ultimately culminate on track 13, the should have been a hit (and was to some degree) I Burn. Bushman seems to just get down to making his point on the song and it stands out as the SINGLE best tune performed on the bill. That's no slight at all to the track immediately following, however. Fire Burn (aka Fire Bun a Weak Heart) is a big track and one of my favorites by Bushman during his entire career. Bushman performs the song standard and then leads into covering songs from some of reggae's greatest sons, such as Marley, Brown and Half Pint. Excellent medley!You should also check Cannabis definitely! The song gets a very very nice reaction from the crowd and it was about this point I start wishing I had been there. Check Bushman losing his cool at the beginning of Man a Lion, recreating the roaring lion sound which appears on the album (and does it again after the wheel up!) great combination there with his backup singers (and they deserve respect, Nikki Burt & Elsa Green), whom throughout the show do a fantastic job, but perhaps no better than on Man a Lion. Check the nice cover Remember de Days, the large She is Gone, and the big finale on Who Send Dem?Overall, I definitely recommend this one! Although I doubt you might be able to find it (this thing even sales out on the regge market sites), should you find it definitely scoop it up. One of the biggest, yet most unappreciated talents in all of reggae music is Bushman and he shines with his raw vocals and experience driven lyrics in a live show. Having seen him now several times at some of the bigger cultural shows here in Jamaica, he surely puts on a good show with HUGE vibes, this show was absolutely no different!

(4.5stars)I suppose in almost every genre of music (espcially those of African origin) there are 'rewards' for the efforts of the most determined of its fans. Reggae in particular, largely due to both the scattered geography of its native region as well as its overall popularity in the most obscure of musical circles, has a wide WIDE array of artistic 'rewards' for the fan who is willing to go the extra mile in order to seek them out. Reggae artists from Hawaii to HELSINKI have found love from fans willing to seek out the strongest vibes in the world.Here in the Caribbean from neighboring islands we also have talents which are deserving of spins on the world stage. Such an artist is the ridiculously talented Ossie Dellimore from the gorgeous south eastern island of St Vincent. Typically not known for producing reggae artists (much more known for its soca exports, i.e. Kevin Lyttle and more recently Jamesy P) St Vincent is a place just now seeming to capitalize on the powerful vibes emanating from the islands with more young talent coming up as well. Dellimore himself, now living in NYC, is to perhaps assume somewhat of a pioneering role, particularly with the WELL POWERFUL roots music he has made his life's work.Dellimore has a 'loud' style of singing somewhat resembling the vibes of Peter Tosh with just a dash more of melody (such as. . . maybe an Everton Blender). Freedom's Journal is Dellimore's powerful debut album which was originally released on the New York based indy label AB Records in 2000; ultimately to be re-released by the more well known Skank Records just a few years later in a slightly upgraded version. What you will probably notice first of all in listening to FJ is Dellimore's seemingly never-swaying commitment to righteousness. You won't find ANY lover's rock, a livication to Mama or even an herbalist tune in the mix at all! Only the fine fine (although somewhat out of place) Rocker Reggae fails to follow that lineage as it is more of a tribute to the vibes overall (and still a powerful and necessary track).Highlights here include the huge To the Limit! To the Limit almost has an old school Shaft-like vibe opening to it only to elevate itself to some realm somewhere near Reggae Heaven! The song is that powerful and ALMOST had me questioning just why I didn't select it as the finest overall effort from Freedom's Journal. Other strong contenders include the opener The System. The System is probably the best tune here in overstanding Dellimore's approach. The song is nothing you've never heard before (and actually sounds like it could have been written and voiced by Tosh himself) but Dellimore adds his own loud and almost overwhelming style to it, to the point where its a matter of yes, you've heard this lesson before, but when this man teaches it you WILL listen!Another very strong aspect to Freedom's Journal is that it was originally (and just remastered on the re-release) recorded as a 'live' studio album. The vocals and backing tracks were laid together during the same session at the same time with Dellimore singing with his backup singers (who do a fine fine job throughout). Such is a style which is always successful, with recently, Bushman taking the vibes on his 2004 release, Signs.Also check the nice (talking about excellent backup singing) Fire Man a strength to all Rastafarian everywhere, 'Yes we have the will to overthrow spiritual wickedness both high and low. By the power of Jah Trinity with Majesty and Love!' Just a very strong track! Check a tune after Tosh's own heart, Downpressor Man. Dellimore's track is not a remake of the Red X's but an original vibes but it is without a doubt something that would have brought a smile to Tosh's face; as would have Justice the more laid back vibes but definitely one of the album's highlights.All that being said the true highlight of Freedom's Journal is that it contains what is simply one of the most magnificent songs I have ever heard. ONE listen to the MAMMOTH Time Has Come is alone worthy of the price of admissions to Freedom's Journal. If you are at all a fan of traditional roots reggae music you NEED to hear Time Has Come. Besides being backed by one of the finest tracks on the entire album (complete with the excellent piano accompaniment) the message on Time Has Come makes the biggest vibes on the album, 'Time has come, truth have to start raining down.' The song also holds the distinction of being Dellimore's first single and was actually released well before the album was originally released but THANKFULLY the tune was included in the album and not just lost by only being available on one compilation that I know of (Easy Star Vol. 1) because it deserves to be heard! Over and OVER AGAIN! (and to that one ridiculously studious reggae fan out there who I know is wondering NO, it is not a remake of Hugh Mundell's classic of the same title).Overall, I definitely recommend seeking out Ossie Dellimore's Freedom Journal. Upon stumbling upon this one I almost immediately sought out more works by Dellimore to find that he is still in the business of making music (and making a new album for Skank Records). Even if he never drops another piece, the world of roots reggae is a far far better place because of the presence of Freedom's Journal (and especially Time Has Come).

The only thing that keeps this cd from being a 5 star album is the song Palmdale. Its a song that is too serious for Afroman to do, and it sounds ridiculously out of place on this record. However, Palmdale, and Palmdale alone is the only sorespot in this otherwise brilliant album. The best songs are Because I Got High, She Won't Let Me. . ., and Crazy Rap. Afroman has a style that reminds me alot of Digital Underground, and Marvin Sease, he has a sense of humor about everything, and that is what makes this album great.

I'm still listening to More Fire every day, even though I've had a few months now. Every song is worth listening to with the favorites being Danger Zone , Who Dem? and Good in Her Clothes. Its just brilliant. VP pulled the right songs and pulled it together, every song is so powerful, so you ant more, you need more fire, even the interludes are tolerable. The Prophet's best work by far.

The last few years have seen some of the better and most overlooked talent in roots reggae music coming out of the tiny northern South American nation of Guyana. Having spent a little time in the country and much time enjoying the vibes eminating from Guyana, I'm always interested in the talent evolving there. Acts such as Yahadanai, Ras Mac Bean and the young First Born, from Walter Fraser's Vizion Sounds camp, are constantly keeping Guyana on the map from Guyana.The greatest artist to ever emerge however has been Natural Black and for years he toiled in virual anonymity in Jamaica fueled only by a few nice hits (such as To My Bonafide and Songs With Feelings), that was until 2005 when his greatest hit today hit, Far From Reality, becoming his firts JA #1 song. It also led to his 3rd studio album (as Locks Lion, wonderful review btw, mentioned) Spiritual Food from Patate and his debut World War from Lion Roots. World War was Natural Black in his developmental stage still, however, Spiritual Food was an awesome album and is his best altogether, but Far From Reality is not too far behind.From the strength of that hit Black signed his deal for this album which he touted would be named Be Patient as per one of his local hits and the fact that everyone was asking him constantly as to when it would be out.The album is a bit more laid back than what I'm used to hearing from Black. The Buju/Terror Fabulous sound is a bit more toned down for the majority of FFR. The best song is title track. Far From Reality both melodically and lyrically is probably Natural Black's best work to date, and although it's now much heard and older, I still love it. Also like the lid bakc bouncy structure of the opener, Think Big. The very very nice Born Inna Struggle which lyrically at least is the type of material I'm used to hearing from Black.This album actually has a carefree feel to it, so many of the middle tracks Can't Mix Intelligence, People Crying and Memories of Life seem to almost fade into one another in a lovely, 'push play and walk away' stylee. Also check the wonderful earlier tunes Nice it Nice and the magical Never Hurt You. I would have loved to see them place the wonderful Going Away combination with Norrisman on this one, over the Triumphant riddim, but still FFR is more than a nice nice album, and is presented well by the ever improving Greensleeves.Overall, definitely pick this one up. Natural Black is one of the talents perhaps 'doomed' to fall in line with the Jr Kelly's and Jah Mason's of the world as in he'll probably never reach the level of popularity that his talent seemingly deserves, however, for true fans of reggae music, seeking out not only this album, but his earlier works as well will be a nice reward from this big big artist.

The Soca Gold annual compilation from VPRecords is always about huge vibes and great times by some of the biggest and some of the not so well-known soca artists from all throughout the Caribbean. It generally covers all forms of the music very well and is always well represented, and I have actually yet to hear an edition of SG which I felt was actually below average.2005 is absolutely no different and with all the pub that Soca has gotten in the last year (by virtue of posterboys Rupee and Kevin Lyttle) it may prove to be the most popular edition of the series yet.Luckily, the album itself does not dissapoint at all! There is some really fun material here, from the opening track of soca legend Machel Montano, to the unbelievable stretch of really good songs which closes the album. Montano is the star here, appearing on two of the album's best track, the opener, Madder Dan Dat and the absolute best tune here, a combination with Rikki Jai called Mor-Tor. Mor-Tor is MASSIVE and besides the chilled opening, never really lets you go when it goes to full tilt. Soca Monarch Bunji Garlin is also present more than once, once in a solo, his best effort Right Now and another in a combination with future posterboy Edwin Yearwood on All Aboard 2k5, and finally in a remake of the tune Lorraine with Explainer.The real story about SG 2K5 however, lies in tracks 11-18. There is some flat out amazing music which closes the album. Besides Mor-Tor is the excellent Sleeping in Your Bed by Michelle Sylvester; the hilarious A Hook by Blackie T; also the beautiful Recurrence by Sanell Dempster, which may or may not be a tribute to late Soca head Onika Bostic who died in 2004, beautiful regardless; and needs to be a future star Blazer, blazing on Crazy Wine which is one of the album's best tunes, he was also in such a position on SG 2K4. From the 1st half of the album, you really have to check Turn Around as well, by Hot Sand.Overall, I'd definitely stamp a seal of approval on this one and recommend it beyond a normal record. Only thing that disappointed me here was the lack of a tune by Dawg-E-Slaughter (and maybe the odd tune Candy, but even that's growing on me). If you at all caught any of the massive soca bug that circled the world in 2004 then you should check out SG 2005, and tell em I sent you.

Is there any artist in music today whose bag of lyrics runs deeper than Sizzla Kalonji's? Consistently releasing 3 heavy albums a year (Greensleeves, VP, and Jetstar 1 each) along with around the same number of lower label albums, while rarely repeating the same tune on any 2 albums, its just weird now. Last year's mega hit Da Real Thing seemed to forecast less studio time and more touring time for Sizzla and while he's canceling shows, he's still churning out albums.Rise to the Occasion is the followup to last year's ultra over-looked Ghetto Revolution (overlooked due to Da Real Thing). With current dancehall ace Vendetta behind tghe boards Kalonji offers one of his oddest releases to date. Its crammed full of everything that his fans love and hate about the artist. While not exactly high on slackness, the bullets fly all over the place on Rise to the Occasion (see I Was Born and Don't Trouble Us), which he does in his trademark style of teaching at the same time, he also fulfills his role as being reggae music's leading authority dancehall/roots brilliance. The album's best song is Nice &amp; Lovely, also really like the title cut, which sounds in theory a lot like the title track of last year's album, however, Vendetta gives it the Prince computerized vocal treatment. Also really love Its Burning, the excellent The One and All I Need.Overall, of course you don't play around when it comes to an artist like Sizzla, Rise to the Occasion is by no means groundbreaking work for thr artist or the genre, but its solid enough for him at this stage where he has scant a fan he has yet to impress. And biggup Greensleeves for the packaging, very attractive photography. See you same time, same place, next album, this time next year.

The 2 cd's in Ghetto Slam are a showcase for Cecile's talents, as she is exploding on the two rhythms on the album, the ghetto slam and the aftermath. On the Ghetto Slam, she has a song with Danny English and a female artist who I never heard of named Nadz, its called Silent River and its amazing. Also on the rhythm is Red Rat, being himself with Turn It On, and Goofy doing the same on Wuk Yuh Gal. A song by Spragga Benz &amp;Tanya Stevens, Nuh Mek It, is pretty good as well, and Beenie Man, just being odd on Lots of Money. . . Lots of Girlfriends. The aftermath is better than the ghetto slam, the intro is hilarious with a frisky Cecile begging from 'Freddy', that leads into the song Freddy by Tanya Stephens, which is fantastic. Listen to Starting Over by new artist Real T and Move by Red Rat and Mad Anju. But as always Sean Paul rules the rhythm with Gal Dem a Request We, which sounds a little like his hit ES EE EX. If you really like Cecile, and decent dancehall to boot, then pick up Ghetto Slam.

These days you can generally lock down a guarantee at least one release a year coming from Junior Kelly and the fine people over at JetStar records, and they are usually of a high quality, and serve as an excellent way for him to keep his name in the public outside of Jamaica as well. While I'll argue until he goes to that level again that the best Junior Kelly inna album was on 2000's Rise, which was just a monster of an album, 2004's installment, Creation, has its good moments as well.The best moment of Creation is a little bouncy sounding tune called Burdens Heavy which sounds very very catchy and about as original of a tune that I've heard anytime recently. Also really love Evil Do'ers on which Kelly somewhat abandons straight djaying and opts, towards the later stages of the tune, to just employ a talking style and it works in the particular song. Also, really really love Jah Knows. Another tune called Exile really good tune, and Dem No Remember (which pretty much clears up Kelly's Bobo Ashanti leanings), nother good song. Also, while the album's description may boast of complete exclusive tunes, the track 'Black People' appears on his previous VP album Smile under the title African Bound. And the finisher on the album is one of the worst Junior Kelly sounds you'll ever hear. Burn It probably indicates that Kelly has been listening to a little bit too much Sizzla recently (and haven't we all) as he goes through the entire song in a similar tone to Sizzla's oft-over-animated over-agressive shout. And while its debatable whether or not that tone works for Sizzla, its apparent, it doesnt work for Kelly at all.Overall, Creation, might actually be Junior Kelly's most hardcore DJ album ever. Certainly he goes the chanting route a lot, but he really seemed intent on sticking to a straight up DJ style. Creation, doesn't suffer for that, and nor will his future output should he decide to do more of that, but Kelly's real strength is chanting over really solid roots foundations. Creation has enough of that to make it a winner.

This is a weird one.About a year and a half ago, I wrote a review for a riddim album for the Sleepy Dog riddim. The Sleepy Dog, like the Old Truck, was built by the legendary Steely & Cleevie production duo. My biggest complaint about that album was that the riddim had so clearly outshone about 90% of the artists voicing over it that it made the album pretty much unlistenable for the long haul.The more things change, the more they stay the same.Enter the Old Truck riddim. Not similar to the Sleepy Dog in terms of sound, this one has much less of an edge and can probably be best described as 'bouncy', but still a good solid riddim by the duo. And it is an utter mystery to me as why these professionals (albeit several of them completely mediocre) are unable to really deliver a SINGLE hit over this riddim which seems relatively easy to ride.The Old Truck did virtually no damage in the dance, while its predecessor did actually spawn 2 Jamaican #1's, I doubt any of these songs really charted, it just was cursed immediately after it was released. It has that old school sounding vibe (reportedly based on an older riddim which to my ear sounds nothing like it so I'll save you the stress of thinking about it yourself) which is popular these days (and was incredibly popular in 2005) and as I mentioned its a good riddim.But take away Assassin and S-H-O-C-K-I-N-G-L-Y Lexxus and there are no real winners here. There are glints of contenders, but no champions. Assassin almost wins the best track by default, his Rip It Up is solid, but nowhere near his best offering. And Lexxus? I don't know what happened there. But on his Clowning, he manages to stumble on his feet towards the finish line and by virtue of staying on his feet, wins 2nd place.But, Lady Saw, TOK and Elephant man and some of JA's most mediocre talent (perhaps the king of mediocrity in Powerman and the prince in Hawkeye) all fail to hit the mark on their tunes. Saw is seemingly so confused that she goes in a talking style minus the style for the first twenty seconds of her Tek di Fence; Buju goes through the motions for the album's third best (or 9th worst depending on how you're looking at it) tune on his Temperature with one of the blandest choruses you'll ever hear from Gargamel; and TOK and Elephant vex so hard on the Old Truck that they don't know what to do and recycle lyrics from older tunes on their Hotta Than and Tek it Off, respectively.Overall, no way do I recommend this one. I even thought for a second to maybe even give this a one (which I think I've only done once in over 265 reviews) star rating. But, just like the Sleepy Dog, the riddim here is nice! One of the better tracks is even the closer which is the clean riddim, so here it is: Buy this album and see how good you can do over the version. Otherwise, leave it where you find it.

Somewhere in Jamaica right now, Predator, Macka Diamond and Kid Kurrupt are all waiting to have their debut albums released by reggae giant label Greensleeves, Vybz Kartel is waiting to his official sophomore effort and no one (and I mean no one) knows what happened to Red Rat.One person who isn't at all disappointed with GS's release schedule is Sizzla Kalonji. He who just 8 months ago had perhaps his best album in a couple of years (which is saying alot when you go 4-5 deep a year), the self-produced Life, released by Greensleeves, is already back on the different and more serene sounding Soul Deep. Not only did it not take long for Greensleeves to release Soul Deep, despite the lack of 'warning' (it just sort of showed up one day) it took only slightly longer for Sizzla to find his way back into the studio with superproducer Vendetta, and he sounds very on point over Vendetta's different programs.The duo first hooked up on the surprisingly critically acclaimed Rise to the Occasion, the album was Sizzla's most experimental to date (and still is) and freely stepped in and out of the reggae boundaries. It took just about 22 months for them to hook back up, and I'm more impressed with Soul Deep than the. . . downright weird RtO.There's a lot of good material here, perhaps the best being Be Strong over the immortal Drop Leaf riddim. Also LOVE Where Are You Running To? Girl Come to See Me, the r&b; drop of All I Want with Morgan Heritage (the family returning the guest which Sizzla gave to their recent effort Full Circle). The simpleness of Nothing Bothers Me and of course Why. Why is about as simple as Nothing Bothers Me, but its souped up and the cool agressiveness which Sizzla displays on the cut is just funny almost, but he kicks it into high gear in typical Kalonji style.Overall, I'm not really prepared to call Soul Deep a better album than Life (yet), but its better than Rise to the Occasion. As a pair, Sizzla & Vendetta may be on the verge of something special, at this rate we wont have to wait very long to find out.

Any album with Dancehall Queen, the original Girls Dem Sugar, Romie and Who Am I? is a winner. Even has the Bob Marley cover with Luciano on Crazy Baldhead. And on the second disc, check out Wicked Man, Mobster and of course Kette Drum with Determine.

Strictly the Best returns for 2005 with both #33 & #34 dropping the same day (today), going back to its roots; #33 in the equation is the pure jumper's album all amped up dancehall, that you really dont have to be a fan of to appreciate the vibes.The selection on the STB has generally been of more of a hardcore tune than VP's more commercial series in Reggae Gold. Not everyone, and not even every reggae fan will have heard (usually) every tune on the album, and such is the case on #33 as the album ends with a virtual trip down average dancehall lane, with Shane-O, Idonia and Busy Signal pulling up the rear with Lighning Flash, Lolly and Not Going Down respectively, only the very Kartel-ish Busy Signal scores anywhere near a point amongst the 3. And JA club's finest dj Soltex makes yet another unfortunate appearance in the studio for the Move Your Body remix, which works in person in a club, but flops on record.What's good about STB#33? Well first of Notorious. The best tune on the album is Turbulence's Notorious which might've fit better on #34, but its here and its massive. Bounty Killer tackles the timeless Slengteng with Wayne Smith's original haunting vocals backing him and the tune really works. And of course upstart Assassin's (also probably better suited to #34)God Nah Sleep, which should have been on his album.However, I'd say that the best (pure dancehall) on the album is reserved for the first 2 tracks. Elephant's ode to slain King of the Dancehall Bogle, Willie Bounce is just so odd that it works, as he turns I Will Survive into a bonafide smash dancehall tune in his best dance offering since Log On. Track 2 features one of the most original tunes you'll ever hear from Lef Side and Esco, over their own Throwback Giggy riddim, Tuck in U Belly, an ode to skinny women in JA. I can't deny that I dont share in their sentiments (love a little meat on my plate) but the tune works and was one of the bigger hits in JA this year.Overall, I'd call STB#33 right in the middle. Its average, but the highlights are higher than the lowlights are low. Some big tunes here and there make this one a by if you haven't heard them (especially Willie Bounce & Tuck in U Belly (Notorious is available on a better album)). Its not as good as #34, but all in all a decent dancehall album nevertheless.

This is the third album that I've gotten by Kalonji in the past 3-4 weeks, and he is batting a thousand this year, because each has been spectacular. Black History being the third best of the three is still a very good album. The best track here is Instance, where Sizzla's flow is about as good as it gets from a sound standpoint. Ater Instance the best songs include Run Dem to Wrong, Ring Leader and Galong. One of the other songs, No Pain, is a complete showcase of Sizzla's vocal strength, as he straight chants on the entire track, its very very refreshing to hear a dj have that dimension that he can showcase to mix it up a little. Overall, I'd have to say that Sizzla is currently putting out the best music available in Reggae, and Black History, while not absolutely his best work, is certainly much better than what a lot of dj's are offering this year.

Capleton had some seriously huge footsteps to follow in &quot;More Fire&quot;, but Still Blazin does way more than simply follow in More Fire's steps. This is one of the better albums that I've heard in a long time. There are no weak tracks at all, all of the beats are top notch, and Capleton rides them to nearly perfection. The best song here is hard to tell because all the cuts are very good. Check Search Fi a Find, the acapella beginning of which is amazing, check I&amp;I Chant (which I would probably say is the album's best), Punchline 2 Hit, Hail King Sellassie with Luciano of course, and even the hidden track Gimmid Di Woman, which was a great addition by VP. I also really like the track How It Ago, kind of a Hip-hop sound to it, and Cooyah Cooyah, the lyrics are fantastic there. Check Guerilla Warfare and WHOA! on the dancehall side. Overall, you haffi have this record if you are a reggae fan. Many of Capleton's tracks sound like Marley beats so it appeals to nearly everyone. Don't wait, go get it! AMAZING!

Smile follows just perfectly in the line of his albums. Smile is a really nice album. The opener, I Nah Bow, is about as mighty as Junior Kelly can get, beautifully crafted message on that one, just really nicely done. The title cut, in my opinion the best track, is a really mellow, nicely done track, and i have to give VP the credit for the packaging because it totally captures the mood on the record. Also check Take Me There with up and coming Calibe, kind of an R&amp;B style combination, but keep an eye out for Calibe in the future. Love Just Another Blend, Baby Can We Meet, Till the Soil and Trod. I hope that this album gets somewhat of a push from VP, its similar to Anthony B's Street Knowledge which didnt get too much of a push, but the market is up for a really good roots album, along with Turbulence's new albums, Junior Kelly's Smile might be the one. Check it out.

(3.5stars)It was WAY back in February of the year 2000 when UK giant reggae/dancehall label Greensleeves released installment number one of their now famed Rhythm Album Series. Up until that point, you had seen several labels, (generally fairly small in size and stature and almost ALL are gone these days) release such an album for modern dancehall but none REALLY stuck on and most were generally only given for a truly BIG riddim. Greensleeves changed that and after that first release, for Ward 21's LETHAL Bellyas riddim, the series has since soared to one of the most popular in the business period and tops out these days with the Warning Riddim, number 88 in almost nine years of the running series (incidentally, the year 2004 was the top in terms of prolificacy as it saw the series run from number forty seven to number sixty-six, twenty releases in all). Seemingly to answer that, the following January 2001, Greensleeves' largest competitor at the time, the US based VP Records launched its very own riddim album series which would come to be known as `Riddim Driven', with the double release on a single disc of the Chiney Gal riddim alongside the Blazing riddim (produced by Scatta and Ce'cile and Norman `Bulpus' Bryan, respectively). The main track of attention there was that the album at the time (and to my knowledge, almost eight years later is only one of two) was the ONLY official album which featured the aforementioned Ce'cile's breakout and controversial hit, Changez. Who could have guessed (not me) that all these years later the series would STILL be running and doing so (by my count), with its most recent addition, the To The World vol. 1 from producer Arif Cooper's Fresh Ear Productions checking in at a whopping number one-hundred-thirty-four! That's almost fifty more than the year older Greensleeves' Rhythm Album Series, despite the fact that the last three years (two in particular) have seen a SHARP drop in the number of Riddim Drivens released annually with 2008 only seeing three so far with none seemingly on the schedule again until 2009. The series has ingratiated itself SO MUCH into the landscape of reggae albums that should you find yourself in ANY record store in any corner of the world which carries a relatively decent amount of reggae: I can all but guarantee you the presence of some Bob Marley albums AND at least one copy of some obscure installment of one of the Riddim Driven releases. It is the type of thing that you really don't tend to pay attention to until it is gone as suddenly in ate 2007 I looked up and noticed that there weren't as many as there had been in prior years (the series peaked between 2002-2004 when twenty-one, TWENTY-SIX and twenty-two were released in those three years, respectively). And while I don't expect to see the days of twenty plus Riddim Drivens coming out of VP come back anytime soon or ever again. The series has definitely provided reggae and dancehall album buying fans some great vibes and thrills in its nearly eight year history.So that kind of brings up the question of which was your favourite? For Greensleeves, things are a bit easier as the Bellyas is EASILY one of my favourite riddims of all time, but is only topped by the MAMMOTH Diwali riddim (#27). For Riddim Driven, my favourite was PROBABLY the Liquid riddim from Sean Paul's producer Jeremy Harding at Two Hard Productions. You also have the Hard Times, the I Swear, the Juice, the Throwback Giggy, the Glue, the X5 and more recently the Jam Down, Guardian Angel, the Dreaming and the Full Draw Riddim Driven releases all ranking very high for me. Somewhere down on the list, probably in the twenties or thirties (surrounded by pieces like the Consuming Fire and the Career) is one of my somewhat underrated favourites, the dark and BOUNCING (if such a combination can exist in one riddim) Forensic riddim from Byron Murray's and Clifford Smith's (aka Mr.Vegas) In the Streetz Productions and built by veteran producer Computer Paul. This release is kind of like the aforementioned Career riddim (which featured Vybz Kartel's MAD tune Get It Back) and others such as the Phantom Riddim, the Trafalga and even Lenky's Dreamweaver, where it just STUCK with me for one reason or another and all these years later I'll still haul it out of the archives about once a month or so, just to remember the time and enjoy one of my favourite periods of (underrated) dancehall. The Forensic riddim itself has a very kind of dark and murky, yet old school sound and its built, almost completely, over a VERY HEAVY and spotty drum pattern which, to my ears, can make it pretty hard to ride. The old school vibe to my ears comes from its quality (or `state') of being deceptively slow paced, despite backing hard and intense digital aged modern dancehall. Should you be able to acquire the clean four minute version of the Forensic (available on the double LP, not on the single CD) you can TRY HARD not to focus on the drum pattern and REALLY listen to the other sounds you hear surrounding it and what you'll hear is a riddim that basically isn't even there, its like a `sleeping' riddim. One of the HARDEST yet minimalist theorized compositions I can think of on a dancehall riddim PERIOD. I actually refer to it as a `two-drop' dancehall riddim, akin to the one-drop you'll hear on the roots side, but, again, it would seem TERRIBLY difficult to voice and yet when the artists reach, at least SOME of them give quite a nice account of themselves over the Forensic riddim. I'm not ranking it up there with the likes of the WipeOut riddim (which was rubbish) or the Global riddim (which should have EXCLUSIVELY been voiced by soca artists) or the all but forgotten RIDICULOUS Ice Cube riddim, in terms of being difficult to ride, but it definitely presents quite a problem. HOWEVER, you might not know it with some of the performers here. As the Forensic riddim reached its own Riddim Driven album for VP Records, it was highlighted by very strong performances by then up and comers and then unknowns alike, with just one or two familiar faces adding a dash of `seasoning' for one of the most underrated dancehall riddims of all time.Artist selection for any given riddim is ALWAYS the most crucial of elements in building a good riddim. You can have an absolute PEACH of a riddim and have average artists or artists who aren't right for the vibes of that riddim and absolute RUIN it (see the Old Truck riddim) and you can have a GARBAGE riddim reach the heights because the producer was outstanding in choosing the artists to voice it (again, see the WipeOut, which wasn't good AT ALL, but scored quite a few legitimate hits). Getting things started on the Riddim Driven album for the Forensic riddim is one of the NECESSARY faces on the riddim, Beenie Man with his SKILLFUL Crazy Gal. There is an issue throughout the CD of editing and no song here, period, suffers as much from the censors work than Crazy Gal. Should you be able to procure an original copy of the tune unedited, you'll see its almost Beenie Man near his best (which is absolutely AMAZING dancehall every time). Judging the tune as it really is, it's a very fine way to start off the album and really one of the best tunes on the riddim altogether. Next up is the somewhat gimmicky Fan U Can Can from dancehall veteran boy band (man band?) T.O.K. Like most of the group's work, the quality of this tune varies depending on whose at the mic at any given time. For Fan U Can Can in particular (which has an Oriental type of melody of all things) the leader is DEFINITELY Bay-C whose efforts throughout are just mad and the best of the group on this particular tune which is fairly standard T.O.K. fare at the end of the day (and that song can grow on you SOOOOOOOOOO quick, TRUST ME!). Completing the opening is one of the more unlikely of choices for the riddim, Sizzla, with his rather awkward Watch Now. Sizzla is another artist who has quite a bit of problem with censorship, but at least Beenie put forth a good tune. Unedited Watch Now is still FAR FAR away from the best Kalonji you'll hear, even on such a riddim as well, he just doesn't ride it very well on something which sounds almost like a complete freestyle, save for the chorus, initially; by the end even that sounds like something he had just made up in the studio that day without having ever heard the riddim previously. Its kind of an unusual start to the album altogether, highlighted but not `what was' but more like `what could have been'.YOU KNOW you have something kind of strange going on when you have a riddim where Lexxus actually scores quite well anytime after around 2002 or so and the Forensic definitely falls into that category as his effort here, Show Mi A Signal is actually quite good (also see the aforementioned Old Truck riddim) and by virtue of being merely `quite good' its actually one of Lexxus' best tunes of his entire career! At the same time Lexxus was blowing up, a good friend of his was doing the same, Sean Paul (they both signed to VP Records and released their debut albums within months of each other). The now dancehall poster boy checks in with the Forensic's finest tune overall, a remix of one of his most popular tunes and one of my personal favourites, Check It Deeply. From the first time I heard the tune in its original form (which was also for In The Streetz on their Mud Up riddim) I LOVED it and although the remix is slightly souped up vocally, its really still top notch, showing that lethal flow Sean Paul has at times, when he's at his best. ALWAYS BIG TUNE. Also ranking fairly high on the quality scale and probably second best on the Forensic (when taking in consideration that Beenie's tune is edited) is former Sean Paul spar, Ce'cile with her Weh Yu Up To? I always thought this song was particularly underrated and talk about minimalist, Ce'cile rides the Forensic with so little effort, but delivers such a SLEEK and SMOOTH tune trying to keep tabs on the whereabouts of her special guy. The results are impressive indeed (and she wouldn't have to look that hard to find me). Unsurprisingly also hitting pretty nice on his very own riddim is Clifford Smith himself, Mr. Vegas on his Fatness. The very few singers on the Forensic have a bit easier time of creating a different style of vibes and melodies out of the straight forward riddim and for prime example check the chorus on Fatness, which ultimately goes on to make the rest of the tune sound better to my ears. I'll also go back and mention Diplomat (when he was still actually recording SONGS regularly) on his very strong Nuff A Dem. Diplomat for me ranks alongside artists such as THE WICKED Roundhead and Regan as artists who just never really fulfilled on the overwhelming level of talent they had. Diplomat was/is an aggressive roots/dancehall artist who really had a strong presence and when I heard several nice tunes from the artist from way back I had such great hopes his career would pan out a lot different than it ended up doing. But definitely Nuff A Dem was one of the strongest from back that time from Diplomat. Elephant Man does just OKAY on his Tattoo tune, but I'm sure I've heard those lyrics or that melody from him somewhere else but can't quite put my finger on it, which is a negative to my ears. SURPRISINGLY, doing quite well on the Forensic and actually shooting in with one of the riddims best tunes altogether is Turbulence with the WICKED Hype In Jah. The tune is an example of how to do a roots tune on the Forensic (where Sizzla's tune is an example of how NOT to). I have to mention Kerry's I Got The Man which is just downright BAD. HOWEVER, I think `Kerry' is the same artist now known as `Kerry Star' in which case keep an eye out for her as she has DRASTICALLY improved and is quite good in the version you'll hear her these days. The Riddim Driven for the Forensic riddim ends with extraterrestrial voiced Ghost checking in on yet another remake Time After Time. I typically don't favour Ghost very much. But at the end of the day what you have in the Forensic is a riddim over which BOTH Lexxus and Ghost can achieve to my ears as Time After Time is actually quite well done! Finishing things up on a high note.Overall, I'm not saying that the Forensic is one of the greatest Riddim Drivens that there ever was; far from it actually. But it sticks in my mind and my players as strictly one of the most unique and in that case, underrated and underappreciated riddims in recent memory. And I actually wouldn't at all be surprised to see it pop up again at some point (I would have LOVED to hear a young Vybz Kartel over this thing with its tempo it would be like a slow and underhanded pitch right over the plate for him) given In The Streetz' propensity of having done that type of thing (namely with the aforementioned Mud Up riddim). But it really stands in quite a long list of seemingly forgotten riddims and specifically riddims which reached album through VP's now so famous and well regarded Riddim Driven compilation series, which definitely deserve to come out and play every now and then. Its my hope that someday and someway VP will bring them ALL back maybe in a limited boxed edition or something like such for the masses who may have missed out. As it stands the Forensic Riddim Driven album is recommended STRICTLY to those few hardcore dancehall heads who may have missed out on it. For you, like me, you're likely to stumble upon a hidden gem of a winner in this downright OBESE series.

(4.5 stars)Before I got this album, I wasn't too familiar with Jah Cure, in fact the only time that I had even heard his voice was on his combination tune with Kalonji "King of the Jungle" and that tune was pretty good, but not great. But his album is another story. The biggest thing about this album is the first 5 cuts. The first 5 tunes are the greatest opening on a reggae cd that I've heard since Black Woman & Child. Songs of Freedom kicks it off with one of the coolest most powerful tracks available anywhere, very uplifting; on Sunny Day the vibes continue on this masterful track, then Jah Cure and Spectacular absolutely kill it on Chant, on Jah Bless Me he rides with beautiful lyrics, "I know jah jah bless, no wicked man can test me, no matter what they try", and then my favorite cut on the album with the very underrated conscious dj Jah Mason, Working So Hard, it reminds me a little of an old Sizzla and Luciano combination tune Jah Blessing. Perhaps the two can be so lucky as to have careers like Luciano and Kalonji, because the potential is there. Over the next 7 tunes, the beautiful vibes clearly continue, with excellent tunes like Guide Us Jah, Praises, Spread Jah Love and Move On. Overall, I say get this one, it would probably help if you had at least a slight of familiarity with artists like Sizzla, Luciano, Capleton, Anthony B etc. because that is same type of message that this Bobo sings about. Jah Cure is simply to good not to pay attention to.

Music may very well, and seemingly does, strike every bone in Turbulence's body from his foot to his dread, and it is becoming increasingly evident in his ability to release albums consistently, multiple times a year. All of his album fall over a certain line of quality and, to date, have yet to disappoint. He is probably setup to be the future king of roots reggae, and with the recent resurgence of the music, it is certainly no small role by which to call someone, fortunately, this someone has the skills.Hearing Turbulence over the course of a few years now and now 9 albums, his messages have pretty much become clear. His brand of reggae follows a great deal that of his mentor, Sizzla's. Take away a lot of the edginess and add a mellower vibe and you'll have Turbulence almost exactly.His newest album, Triumphantly, follows what I still maintain is his best effort to date, the brilliant Join Us on Kingston Records as well. Nope, Triumphantly isn't as good as the massive Join Us, it doesn't offer the variety of brilliance of as high of level as its predecessor did, but the album is still pretty good on its own merits. The best tune here is probably Music is Life which is, oddly enough, his second combination track with Luciano, very good tune. Also have to check the lyrically wonderful Suffer No More, Gun Crazy and what I maintain is the album's second best, Blood Dem Out with the wonderful backing, beautiful song mixed with an edge.Overall, this, amongst all of Turbulence's albums after his first 2 goes to show the start of his potential. You listen to some of the ranges on this record and its absolutely amazing, if you go backwards and get Join Us after this one, you can see what happens when he puts it all together. Also, you have to check out his underground album, Words of Wisdom, which is a better album than Triumphantly, but doesn't show quite the range. Check this one out if you're a fan, or if you just want to be in on the groundfloor of something special.

When the question of who are my ABSOLUTE favourite reggae artists on the scene comes, its often a hard question for me to answer because I listen to so much music. Without a doubt topping that list over the past half-decade or so has been Sizzla Kalonji, who equate as the current era's leader of roots reggae which is the music that I most enjoy. Others on the list include the `usual suspects' such as Capleton, Luciano, Anthony B and of course Buju Banton, while my dancehall favourites are even fewer and after the Beenie's, Lady Saw's and Mad Cobra's of the world (might throw General Degree in as well), the list hasn't been very consistent at all. However, more and more recently it seems as if there are more and more young artists who are consistently impressing me with combining the old school roots with a new style which is proving to do the same with millions of people all over the world outside of the Caribbean as well. These younger artists have included names such as Lutan Fyah, I Wayne, Jah Mason and several other Jamaican artist who, despite the ULTRA competitive nature of roots reggae (especially on the island), have managed to distinguish themselves from there peers and continue to do so. Another such artist who rather quietly joined the list of my top favourite artists a few years back was the Trinidad native with the awe-inspiring vibes, Jeneile Osbourne, better known as Queen Omega. In hindsight, recognizing what the modern roots reggae scene in Trinidad has become since Queen Omega came on the scene, perhaps years from now the artist (just now still very young at just 26 years old) may assume some type of pioneering role. Since then we've seen artists such as Prophet Benjamin, Jah Bami, King David, the truly wicked I-Sasha and perhaps most notably Jah Melody, Marlon Asher and Khari Kill emerge as roots reggae artists from an island whose dominant vibe is without a doubt the total absolute extreme opposite of roots reggae; Soca. And while, without a doubt, it will snow ten feet in TnT before roots reggae would overtake soca in terms of popularity, the overall landscape of music from Trinidad has changed with songs like Kill's Picture of Selassie I, Asher's Ganja Farmer and I-Sasha's ultra addictive Don't You Know spinning not only in reggae communities all over the world, but in Jamaica as well. Queen Omega didn't necessarily have the luxury of the reggae world keeping an eye on her music as, even today, you are more likely to see her music associated with Jamaica than her homeland. Instead she almost single handedly forced herself on the reggae world through singing the types of song which fans of reggae music could just legitimately not ignore.Queen Omega released her very first album (of five to date so far, definitely looking for a number six in 2008) in 2001, a self titled piece which marked her arrival on the reggae scene and at the same time was a VERY unusual album. I don't necessarily know the circumstances of how it happened, but what a strand of blessings she received in that, for such a young and basically unknown artist, joining Queen Omega on her debut album was none other than the likes of Sizzla, Capleton AND Anthony B! She even had a song, The Warning, which featured BOTH Sizzla and Capleton alongside Queen Omega in a combination, while the closer of that album, I Realize featured Anthony B and was the strongest track on a very strong album. Her second album, 2003'S Pure Love was even stronger. While it lacked the star power of its predecessor (albums from Sizzla, Anthony B and Capleton THEMSELVES lack that kind of star power) it was a stronger album overall which showed just about every aspect of the artist with a more consistent backing. Culminating with the absolutely divine I Believe In Love and a VERY unlikely appearance from legendary dancehall bad boy Ninjaman on Bad Man Can't Make Love, Pure Love was a wonderful piece which STILL is worth the effort in tracking down if you've yet to have the opportunity to enjoy it. The third album, Away From Babylon of 2004, was Queen Omega's definite opus and sincerely one of the finest albums I have EVER heard. I don't think an entire week, and definitely not a two week period, has passed in the nearly four years since its release that I haven't spun Away From Babylon at least once. The album, which featured not a single combination, was by far the most polished version of Queen that we have seen to date and actually featured her voicing over some classic reggae material, including a Marley piece. It also featured material such as the title track (which was ultimately remixed and featured on Macka B.'s BIG Word Sound & Power album later that same year), Jahmazing Grace, and Ganja Baby which comprise pretty much the biggest international hits of her career to date and helped make an absolute winner of the album. Oh yeah and from that album. . . Check Deliver Me (and I'll leave it there). Most of her early career was spent under the watchful eye of established producer Michael Swaby for his Green House family label (Swaby also served a similar function for new TnT sensation Jah Melody). Since then, Queen Omega has remained very active. Touring all over the world and even maintaining somewhat of a semi-regular schedule appearing on local stage shows and festivals here in Jamaica (particularly on Tony Rebel's Rebel Salute stage) has helped keep her name as quietly one of the most in demand international roots artists. And, it must be mentioned, that alongside Queen Ifrica and VI Empress Dezarie (soon, we'll be throwing the names Lady Passion and Marlene Johnson in there as well) Queen Omega has helped to KEEP a very strong feminine vibes on the roots scene and not just in the dancehall where different aspects of femininity are appreciated. You listen to a Queen Omega song and you hear exactly the female vibes to some of her male peers. Truly the Omega to the Alpha.If you have yet to have the experience of enjoying Queen Omega's vibes, I would most liken her to a female version of the Messenjah, Luciano. If you take that template, you can pretty much get an idea of what she might sound like, but what you won't get from that is her personality. Queen Omega doesn't necessarily make the `standard' roots fare. And while her voice is without a doubt the one SPECTACULAR direct talent which she possesses alongside a very sharp lyrical pen, the Queen's personality and attitude definitely make her music great just as much as her technical ability, and unlike Luciano (although he does OCCASIONALLY) Queen Omega does mix in a DJ style every now and then. Since Away From Babylon, the Queen has released two albums, 2006's VERY hard to find Servant of Jah for Ariwa and this piece, Destiny, released on the last day of 2004 for France's top roots label, Special Delivery and distributed by French label Nocturne (while her debut, Pure Love and Away From Babylon were JetStar pieces). In terms of quality, without a doubt the wonderful Destiny falls right behind Away From Babylon as Special Delivery's (headed by production duo `Bost & Bim') style of production, which is heavy roots with a bit of twists, blends nearly perfectly with the Queen's style (which itself could be described as roots, with a twist). Destiny opens with (the very Luciano-ish) the ceremonial reading of Psalms 8, Psalm of David. The opening is pretty much a musical intro which certainly serves the listener to know that you are currently listening to RASTAFARI music. When the music gets started there will be no doubt as the first two complete songs on Destiny are without a doubt two of the three strongest pieces on the album altogether! If the opener didn't confirm the direction of this album to you, then definitely doing that is the second track, the beautiful Selassie I Know. Selassie I Know is an original SD production which absolutely caught a hold to audiences and proved to be one of the most popular tracks on the album with a certain punch line of `Selassie I Know, that I cannot live without you, Selassie I Love You!'. I would probably call Selassie I Know the third finest track on Destiny altogether and the absolute strongest track immediately follows it with the awesome Judgment. Judgment actually received the honour of being the title track of the very strong Special Delivery riddim which backs it (same riddim features Capleton, Fantan Mojah, Ras Shiloh and Jah Mason) and its quite apparent as to why. It joins the aforementioned Ganja Baby and Away From Babylon as the biggest hits of Queen Omega's career and it stands above the rest on a VERY strong album. I'll also say that the tune GREATLY exhibits what I mean when I say that her personality really comes through in her music, NO ONE else on the planet could sing a song like Judgment besides Queen Omega.Concluding the excellent start and getting the middle of the album started on a good note is the excellent Forever In Love. The song is a very nice one-off from SD which has a riddim which is marked by a downright brilliant nyah drum played by none other than the inimitable Bongo Herman himself. The song is just a lovely piece and it doesn't develop the way you might think with the title Forever In Love. It is a love song definitely, but a love song about His Imperial Majesty and very well done. A big deal is made out of the title track here which is also the album's second strongest piece. Destiny the song is even afforded its own interlude which is pretty much harmless and kind of looked to be just some way through which Bost & Bim could be involved in the song as the tune itself is one of the few tracks on Destiny which isn't a Special Delivery production. Instead, Queen Omega taps Jamaican producer, Calibud's (who produces a few tracks here) outstanding Lonely riddim as the backdrop for Destiny and she provides him with his riddim's TOP performance. The riddim also includes top notch selections from the likes of Sizzla, Turbulence, Jah Cure and even Calibud's own artist Warrior King, but without a doubt the best tune on the riddim was Queen Omega's Destiny and there is no surprise that, despite the fact that it didn't come from the album's producers, Destiny was chosen as the title track as the Queen blends supremely with Calibud's LARGE anthem-like roots production style. Following Destiny is what is without a doubt the album's most high profile tune as Queen Omega continues her run of making very big combinations, this time with reggae legend and superstar Buju Banton. Their combination, the aptly titled Perfect Combination is a lover's track of the highest order as it flows like water over Calibud's cut of the late great Sir Coxsone Dodd's Studio One We Are in the Mood riddim. The song works completely and Buju pretty much allows the Queen to run the track, but the few `back and forth' style moments between the two are absolutely priceless and the song challenges Warrior King's Empress So Divine as the best tracks on the revived riddim. Speaking of Warrior King, check the next track Me Beg Yu, which flows over Calibud's remake of Gregory Isaacs' Tune In riddim (over which WK had his hit Never Go Where Pagans Go), very very strong roots cut. Two songs later in the album strike a very nice chord with me, both No Retire which was a minor hit over SD's classic vibed Clean Vibes riddim and DEFINITELY the LOVELY Joyful Moment as well, over SD's riddim of the same name. No Retire is a tune through which the Queen strengthens her resolve to Rastafari claiming from it, she won't retire. While Joyful Moment is a pure lover's track, definitely one for the dance floor. Destiny comes to end with the acoustic remix for Keep the Faith. I prefer the original which has a very r&b; style of vibes but the acoustic is a very nice subtle way to close this very strong album.Overall, definitely recommending Destiny. While I certainly wouldn't call it her best work to date (of course that is Away From Babylon) Destiny ranks just one level below and it has been, by far, her most high profile release to date. Destiny is also a very fine statement of her overall talents and she absolutely shines throughout the piece and it is very well done by Special Delivery who I believe has taken over (at least in Europe) managerial duties for Queen Omega as well. Its also worth mentioning that this album was quite successful and in Europe very well exposed and the music did reach all over the world and definitely in Jamaica made an impact as well. Destiny is definitely one of the building blocks for a young artist, destined to be one of the true giants in modern roots reggae. Long live the Queen!

Okay, the main reason that I got this album is because I thought that it would be a war album, meaning I thought that it would be full of tunes that one artist had mad against the other, but its more like a greatest hits album of each from tunes of the early/mid 1990's. Mad Cobra of course wouldn't be Mad Cobra if he didn't include some war/gun tunes, and he did it better than anyone in the business at the time. Best tune from Cobra on the record is Dem Haffi Move, which to this day can hold a dance every once in a while. This album was made at the height of Cobra's power's, and when Beenie was still developing, on the other hand. But even then (Before &quot;Who Am I&quot;), he was still an excellent dj, and of course his specialty was gal tunes, check Tek Weh Yu Girl on this one, he's more politically armed in the rest of his tunes, which isn't his forte, bu still check Once a Year and Bury Yu Dead.If you really really love dancehall, then this underrated gem is really a needle in the haystack, its a very good album. Obviously being a fan of both helps, but even in my case, huge Beenie fan and not much so in Cobra, I still like it.

There are certain artists, particularly in reggae music, who just seem to BELONG where they are from. Their talents don't seem to translate too well when it comes to international appeal, however at home, they can easily be amongst the most popular, or in this case, the most skilled. With the uniqueness of reggae music in its origins and in its current state as well, still being from a very very small corner of the world, we have several talents which fall into this category. A large number of our artists will never be appreciated virtually at all, away from home, by virtue alone, in some cases of the ever so slight language difference.The fine fine dancehall singer Admiral Tibett definitely falls into this category. The singer who emerged at the top of his game, very early into the digital ragga/dancehall era has always been overshadowed by some of the other more popular roots singers such as Luciano, Everton Blender, Junior Reid and of course the late great Garnett Silk. What Tibett does have going for him, however, are some of the most passionate fans in all of Jamaica. I know several slightly older fans of dancehall who almost swear by the perfection of the singer. And while being popular undoubtedly has its perks, it also comes with having fans who may not know your best material, while the rather 'obscure' Tibett has spent nearly his entire career amassing fans who know the lyrics to each and every one of his songs as soon as he steps out of the recording studio voicing them.Myself, I became a fan of Tibett's listening to much of his earlier work. Having established his name working with some of the best producers in the game such as Jammy's and Bobby Digital, Admiral Tibett made some downright MASSIVE records which never received their fair share of spins, however if you pay the slightest bit of attention you'll easily understand his vibes. His style is rather odd as well, its somewhat of a mix between a 'standard' singer such as Luciano, with the straight forward style of voicing and a Michael Rose with the high pitched tweaks. The result is one which worked has worked for the singer for over two decades worth of service to reggae music.This album, Excitement has been a favorite of mind for about 2-3 years since I picked it up. It was his third album for then up and coming VP Records (after Reality Time and Separate Class) and one of his most impressive. Tibett sings some of the finest roots dancehall you'll ever hear anywhere, and you need not search beyond track #5 here for evidence. Is It Because is a MASSIVE track! He poses the question "Is it because I'm from the ghetto? Why you try to keep us down below?" Just a beautiful song about coming up and facing challenges, a well mighty track!The on paper highlight here is without a doubt Rude Boy which is a 3way combination between Tibett and legendary vocalists Horace Andy and Linval Thompson. Tibett definitely holds his own on the record and with 3 absolute vocal geniuses voicing the same track, you can hardly even help but to be impressed with the vibes PACKED into the track. Rude Boy is definitely one of the biggest tracks on the album. You also need to check Call on Jah Name. The song is a nice confirmation of those beautiful Rastafarian values (and from what I remember Tibet is a 12 Tribes) which Tibet has based so many of his wonderful songs on, and Call is amongst the best of them.Excitement checks in as a short 41 minutes, but it is stuffed full of nice material. Check Burn in Flames! Burn in Flames is lyrically SUPERB, basically what Tibet is saying is that the Fire will clear the way for the ultimate return home, when you put it together however, its slightly more complex, what he's saying, but the message, when understood, is just as mighty! Check the wonderfully vibrant title track, a story of the tried and tested topic of the overbearing landlord; check Keep the Fire Burning another wonderful message track, very very high vibes!And even a few other tracks with listening, definitely check Babylon! Babylon is a beautiful track which reminds me full on of Capleton's Leave Babylon. And lastly check Set Me Free which has a much more vibrant and modern feel than the rest of the material here and would probably stand the best chance of being the biggest track here, were this album released today. The only complain-- my only excuse for not giving this one a 5 star rating was the lack of a truly BIG love song. With a voice like Tibet's he can weave them as fine as anyone, and even the closest to such, I Want to Talk is a very decent track.Overall, I suppose should the planets align just right for you and you should happen to find Excitement somewhere, definitely go ahead and pick it up (and sell it to me, because my copy has a little scratch!). Like I mentioned at the beginning, however, Tibet is somewhat of an acquired taste, so even before shelling out the assuredly rather low price of admission for this one, check out the samples DEFINITELY. Afterwards, pick up the album or any of his others, and enjoy, Admiral Tibbet has vibes for centuries! Big singer!

I'll maintain and shout it from the tallest mountain that I can find that the wickedest bad man dj in the history of the dancehall is Mad Cobra. Not Bounty Killer, not Ninjaman, not Shabba, not Supercat, not Kartel, not Merciless, none of them, when Mad Cobra wanted to end you on a record, you were done, he was that wicked.Certainly, the greatest exhibit of said talent is live and in person, however, 1996's Exlusive Decision got about as close as many of Cobra's actual albums did at any time. He never really got around into going over the top with his boasts like Killer or played with his lyrics as Kartel might, his style, much like Merciless' was to go so straight forward so that his point not be ever misunderstood and soon after evolving out his early stages of being a Ninjaman clone, he left a strong roll of lyrics.The strongest effort on ED is Willing gifted with one of the maddest intros you'll ever hear on a record, also love Ready to Kill, the wicked combination with Mykal Rose, Retribution which diversified the artist well enough, as well as War Monger. Also love the classic sounding How Does it Feel, really really big tune.Overall, if you're new to the artist, the 11 track record might be a pretty good place to start as it goes around the clock in showcasing many different facets of the artist (as the cover suggests it might). Its not completely, however, the constant hard pounding that an avid fan might enjoy, but ED is certainly pretty close.

Who am I? Reason enough to buy this record. Another reason is the song Steve Biko, very very good song by Beenie. Oysters and Conch is fantastic as well, so is the Lady Saw collaboration on So Hot. Monster Lock is good too. And finally you have to check out Woman a Sample with Buju Banton, hearing that rapid fire go back between Beenie and Buju is so tight. Fantastic.

I haven't really followed the career of Yellowman, as I am only 20 years old, he was making smashes primarily before I started listening, but this album alone, having not had much experience with Yellowman's music is a very good album. My favorite song is absolutely &quot;Walking Jewelry Store&quot;, he rides the rhythm very good and the song has a lot of humor in it the lyrics. I also like &quot;I'm Getting Married&quot; and &quot;I'm Getting Divorced&quot;, Yellowman kinda made a counteraction for his own record. (always staying on the cutting edge) This album alos has the classic &quot;Nobody Move Nobody Get Hurt&quot;, which many a hip-hop artist used in their music. Overall, I think its a very very good album for an artist that is pretty underrated. He did alot of things for music all together not just inna dancehall.

I don't know why I bought this record, I have absolutely no idea. But I'm glad that I did. Lathun doesn't have the best voice in the world, he doesn't have the best beats on his album, and he's not saying anything that the world hasn't heard before, but he's pretty good at everything. I'm not really into the whole neo-soul thing, really really deep music makes my head hurt, and I'm not smart enough to decipher the code jupiter/mars language that some of todays artists speak about (I mostly listen to reggae music), but Fortunate just does it for me. There aren't any bad songs or 'skippers', you can just push play and walk away. My favorite songs are the opener Love Won't Let Me In, When Love Came In with India Arie, BBQ, and my absolute favorite track Find Somebody Else, but like I said, I like all the tunes. Its the best r&amp;b album that I've bought this year (I admit that I haven't bought many) its cool, relaxing and it can close the show in romantic moments, everything I look for in an r&amp;b record. Overall, I say pick this one up, if you like current style r&amp;b music then you'll probably like this one, if you like neo-soul, like I said, its not partcularly deep so you might not rate this one that highly, but it worked for me.

First of all, this rhythm is excellent. Its one of the very few that sounds decent no matter if a djay or a singer is on it. My favorite of the year is Juice, but the more and more I listen to this one, the more and more I start to change my mind.Can You Do the Work by Cecile and Sean Paul is amazing, it is easily the best track on an album with several very good songs. Sean Paul far and away has the best flows in strictly dancehall music today, and he shines on this 2Hard beat, on both Can You Do the Work and his solo cut Ignite It. But Cecile (who really needs an album of her own) holds her own as she always does. Also here is Lady Saw, who beats it up on her Tell Me What You Like cut. Degree who I'm really starting to like on Step Aside, TOK on Keep It Blazing is very good, of course Elephant Man on the title track to his new record Log On, Lexxus with not his best effort but still tight Bring It and even Mad Cobra staying in the mix with the excellent She Ain't Feeling It. And on the singjay side try Chico on Hold Yu Man, Bring It On To Me by Red Fox and Mr. Easy. Only bad part? Ricky Rudie is just really annoying on Got it Goin' On. But that can't hold this album down at all, one of the best tracks of the year easily, if you like fantastic contemporary dancehall, then pick up LIQUID, no doubt a winner.Drawbacks? I'm not a big

Its not spectacular at all either. Its just not that good. Its all on the same rhythm, which changes drastically on some of the songs, but thats not the problem. The problem is that there are 22 tracks and only 3 or so are really that good.The best song here is by Vegas Mek Me Se Di Hand Dem Sway, thats one of Vegas' best, and even though I don't really enjoy Don Yute, his song with Cecile Get It On, is pretty tight as well. After that its very mediocre, both Kiprich's records are pretty bad. Of course, Sean Paul straight toys with this rhythm just like always, but thats a given its not really worth mentioning that Watch Dem Melt Away is amazing. Chico's Don't Burn Your Bridges is decent. Other than that, mediocrity reigns. I wouldn't recommend this one, its nowhere near Juice, its not even Titanium 2000, its just there.

(3.5stars)The most interesting thing about this edition of VP's famed "Riddim Driven" series is probably something that it doesn't have rather than something that it does have. Finally a version album that doesn't have Elephant Man! Nothing against the Energy God, but saturating the market is one thing, flooding it is another.A Snow Cone production, it sounds like his other bigtime riddim, the Rice and Peas. A quite big sounding riddim that sounds like it might fit well after the climax of an action flick, this time again, Snow Cone brought some serious fire- power to voice on the Earth Wind N' Flames. The best song is Believe It Or Not in from a long overdue combination of Bounty Killer and Spragga Benz. Snow Cone shows a serious Red Square incline as all Sugar Slick, Assassin and Spragga all kill it on this riddim. The second best tune is Assassin's Nothing Else, fantastic progression from the young artist who should be looking at an album soon, Nothing Else along with other current releases from the DJ show a bright future. Speaking of bright futures,perhaps none is greater than Vybz Kartel and he shows why on the above average Straight Gangster with vocal helps from Snow Cone himself. Also really like the influence of the younger artists on this one, besides Assassin and Kartel, Mr. Pepper, Earth Worm, Shano and Lady Spice who also turns it around on her Caan Hold Yu Man. Also really really check Who's Hot by the Empress, and a shocking apparently Rastafarian laced Red Rat on Gully Mouth.Overall, I have to say that nowadays with producers like Lenky and Vendetta changing the game on version albums, what has to be done is a variation of the riddim. It makes it more friendly to the ears and of course to radio. Earth Wind N' Flames doesn't vary much but with the talent it pushes alone I had no problem making it an addition to my collection.

I had more or less given up on the Ragga Ragga Ragga series from Greensleeves. Over the last few years its been little more than a showcase for GS' various signed artists (particularly Vybz Kartel), and it drifted and became a crazy thing for the dance songs which mostly lose their potency when you don't know exactly how to do the particlar dance.2006's edition changes a little bit as it becomes a showcase for the unknown and upcoming artists, the King himself, as well as one of the most dominant riddims the dance has ever seen.The first thing worth noting here is that GS' artists Vybz Kartel and Macka Diamond only comprise 2 of the 18 here. Kartel's track arguably being the single worst one altogether, an unfortunate combination with Shabba Ranking on a remake of Shabba's Love Punanny Bad. Macka's effort may be the only tune that I have actually liked from her, the ultra clever Ugly Man, reminiscent of Ce'cile's 2000 hit Changez.Of course Greensleeves dips into the dance tracks twice with soundman 'Mentally Ill' Matterhorn on Dutty Wine and the increasingly and unfortunately popular Soltex 3000. Matterhorn needs to stay in the booth, and Soltex needs to stay off of albums that I'm considering purchasing, he is AWFUL on his Killa Walk, Prezzi Bounce, but its not his fault, this music belongs ONLY in the dancehall, not on a record of any kind.The good here? Besides Diamond's nearly stellar effort the real story is GS once again tapping Beenie Man for this album. Beenie works 3 tunes here, Heart Attack, Wi Set di Trend and Stamina, with the awesome Stamina being the definite best and perhaps the album's finest. Besides Beenie is the presence of the emerging talent in JA, particularly the ultra-talented Busy Signal. Busy also taps in on 3 tracks, with the first, Too Much Gun being the best, but Lu Lu Lu is clever and very good as well. Busy Signal is making big waves in the dance as well as Idonia who is also here with his funny and witty Chicken Head (Donia sounds a lot like Kartel, but I'd advise him to stay away (as well as Busy Signal) from that Greensleeves contract offer, see Predator and Kid Kurrupt as examples).Also good here is Buju in one of the best tunes that I've heard from the artist in a while Beauty Queen, with the old school sounding vibe on it very impressive. Speaking of old school: You HAVE to check Spice's ultra slack Grab Ya Hood. If for nothing else but for the fact that it is on the '85 riddim from Dave Kelly, easily one of the biggest riddims to EVER emerge from JA. And check Voicemail's Get Crazy, not bad either.All that being said, my favorite tune here is easily More Punani from Dr. Evil, alter ego of Lefside & Esco. The song is HILARIOUS!Overall, I'd definitely reccommend this one more than many of the previous installations in this series. As always its more reccommended for the more fair-weather dancehall fan, but it has enough vibes to keep even the hardest of dancehall heads entertained throughout.

Tracklist1. Nah Mix Up- Elephant Man2. Many Gal- Bounty Killer3. Do or Don't Zumjay4. Taking the Music- Wayne Marshall5. Roll In- Assassin6. The Specialist- Degree7. Send On- Vybz Cartel8. Share My Dreams- Chrissy D9. Fake Badman- Determine10. Head Up High- Bling Dawg11. 20/50 Instrumental- LenkyDo or Don't by Zumjay, Taking the Music by Wayne Marshall and Heads Up High by Bling Dawg are not good tunes. Zumjay's is listenable but barely and the other two are subpar at best. . . That being said, the real star of this album like all albums of this type is the riddim and it, of course produced by burgeoning super-producer Steven "Lenky" Marsden is fantastic. It manages to do what its brilliant predecessors the Diwali and the Masterpiece, respectively, managed to do; In that it takes a completely unique sound which one certainly wouldn't hear and slap a 'DANCEHALL' label on and completely turns it into a complete dancehall riddim with all its beautiful twists and turns.To the album. Is it as good as the Diwali album? Nope. Is it as good as the Masterpiece album? Not really, but very comparable. Is it still a good album? Certainly. Lenky's riddims are truly about vibes and in that category the Time Travel stands comparable to both of its older brothers. The rest of the songs besides the three i mentioned are very good. The best of which being Send On by superstar in the making Vybz Cartel and Roll In by another superstar in the making Assassin. Also really like the Specialist by Degree and Chrissy D who is making quite a career for herself staying on Lenky's riddims with excellent material is great on Share My Dreams which would do great (just like her tune on the Masterpiece) in clubs all over the world were it given the opportunity. Fake Badman by damn good lyricist Determine is tight as well and of course, just like the other two albums one of this albums best songs is the instrumental which is just a very unique mix by Lenky which really does stand well by itself. Overall, of course you can't go wrong here, a complaint would be that maybe it shouldn't have come out until it had more than 11 tracks, Lenky favourite Wayne Wonder is noticably absent, but maybe its better that its not overrun with 20+ tunes as Greensleeves does with its albums, however Lenky has proven his ability to make that many different adaptations of his riddims, and which artist out there wouldn't want to jump on and try riding one at this point? But its still a very good album, just now the Masterpiece is just starting to break all over the world, so it may be a second before the Time Travel gets great airplay, but it will certainly get its chance, (if Greensleeves is smart they'll make Send On a single off of Vybz Cartel's upcomming album)so get the jump on it and snag the riddim album now, seriously incredible vibes, seriously good recordings with some seriously skillful artists and a seriously good album. GO GET IT!

It is now rather timely that Soca music is making a greater and more significant appearance on the international level and finally invading the United States. The last few years alone have seen artists such as St. Vincent's Kevin Lyttle and Rupee and Edwin Yearwood of Barbados take to the international airwaves with their pop-infused style of Soca (most recently known as Popso). Popso has become rather popular as it almost exactly is akin to pop music, with just a tinge of the wildly insane vibes which is the more `traditional' brand of Soca. In its `standard' form, Soca music is anything but standard as it rather easily pushes forth some of the craziest and harshest musical vibes in the world. The heart of the music is Trinidad and Tobago which offers the grandest platform for the music in easily the finest and most divine Carnival in all of the Caribbean every year. Each and every year thousands of people travel from locales all over the world to attend TnT's Carnival (and the trip is ALWAYS worth it) and the last couple of years, with the music itself becoming more and more of a major deal TnT's Carnival has taken itself to an even higher level (and the fact that this past year their football team made it all the way into the World Cup didn't exactly hurt the vibes at all). The attention has attracted not only a new line of tourists eager for a taste of the vibes, but likewise international customers who stay home at Carnival time now nearly as anticipating the next big Soca release fresh from TnT as the next big reggae release from Jamaica And while I've recently been writing reviews acknowledging the potentially lethal development of vibes in roots reggae coming from Trinidad, their Soca counterparts have stepped up their game as well. Likewise, the international record labels have come calling to a greater extent looking to sign up some of TnT's talent, while the best known label for putting out the soca music of TnT, JW Records has even their success rates step up with the releasing of several of their highest profile albums to date. And while audiences all over the world continue to become more and more enchanted with the Lyttle's, Rupee's and Yearwood's of the world (and rightly so, they all make truly excellent Popso music) it really remains to be scene if a soca artist of a more hardcore variety could find a consistent audience amongst the more mainstream international avenues.Meet Mr. Hardcore. While it is nearly undoubted that more potentially marketable soca talents exist in TnT (with probably the most marketable coming in the form of Laventille pint sized dynamo Destra Garcia whose music can be heard playing on Captain Morgan's beer commercials, not just here in the Caribbean, but all over the world as well) there is just as probably no name in all of the music which carries more weight amongst hardcore Soca heads than the name Bunji Garlin. Garlin is ultra-respected name and face of a brand of soca branded, ragga-soca. Ragga-soca most closely resembles dancehall (I'll go as far as to flat out call it a mix between soca and dancehall) and it has to date had no greater champion than Garlin, whom up until 2006 was the two time defending International Soca Monarch (until he was brutally robbed of his title by Shurwayne Winchester. . . Who incidentally was just as maliciously robbed of his title earlier this year by former champion Iwer George ) and the most consistent hit maker in all of soca over the past few years and had actually began to make a dent in the notoriously soca unkind market of Jamaica. Rather unsurprisingly and long overdue, this past winter Reggae giant label VP Records announced the signing of the Trinidad native to an album deal which was just about five years late as they had previously released an earlier album from Garlin in 2005, the solid and odd Revelation. He has since been very consistent in appearing on pieces for the label, being the most frequently occurring name on the label's massive Soca Gold series; while every year I wonder why a certain song didn't reach the Gold album (like already having seen the 2007 edition's I'm already wondering where is Open the Gate by Winchester), a Garlin tune and in some cases more than one, is almost guaranteed.Garlin's style of soca is of course more aggressive lyrically than the insane `Jump and wave' volley's you'll hurt break your sweat and absolutely kill your feet vibing too, although he does that as well. He is almost a pure dancehall artist at times just throwing lyrics forth constantly at a great speed and even going further in some cases and taking someone or something to task in trying to make a song. Most famously, he was involved in a rather public feud with roots reggae sensation I-Wayne who very nonchalantly once referred to Garlin's beloved soca as, `The devil's music'. Garlin comprised the I-Wayne targeted Yuh Mad or What which appeared on his previous album, Next Direction in 2005, a tune which even the staunchest I-Wayne supporter (myself firmly included) had to admit, was near brilliance. A live performance from Garlin is something definitely to behold, at his greatest peak, doing anything to please his audience, including setting himself on fire isn't above the lengths to which Garlin will go. He can also work more level headed and strictly pour lyrics, his style is part Bounty Killa and part Elephant Man all in one which has definitely helped push his overall notoriety, particularly in the Caribbean.I had one large question going into this album, Global, Garlin's latest creation and what is actually his official debut into the truly big time internationally on an album (as Global shall, and probably already has, received a greater push than all of Garlin's other albums combined): How soca heavy would the album be. I'm all but convinced that given the opportunity to do so, Garlin would rather happily release a near completely dancehall album and given the history and function of VP, the biggest reggae label in the world, I'm convinced that they'd happily let him. So what I basically expected was a great number of these tracks to be recorded by the whose-who of dancehall producers, even given Garlin's history over the past year, making himself available on numerous occasions to voice for Jamaican producers. It was, and is, my opinion that Global should be higher on the soca content due to the fact that it is a hardcore soca album which will probably reach more people than any other album of its type has ever done to date. The results are mixed, on a purely musical scale, Global is very very well done. Garlin tackles several dancehall tracks and does excellent on them, and even mixes in two rather odd combinations and has a great deal of success with one of the more unlikely combinations seen in all of Caribbean music in recent memory. But VP has shown (and I'm thankful) over the past few years a nice effort in pushing soca music, not just on their three running soca series (besides the Gold series there's also the D'Soca Zone and 101 series, both of which have seen releases in the past year) and in signing Garlin, but they had been the home of the ultra popular and busy Byron Lee & the Dragonaires and the fine young ragga-soca group the 3Suns over two albums as well. VP has a nice recent history of pushing soca.Global is a high powered introduction to one of the greatest talents we have to offer as the entire Caribbean. Garlin takes on not only as expected both Soca and Dancehall, but also more hip-hop elements, most notably on the combination with NYC rapper Chris Black, Swing It. Swing It is not one of my favorite tracks from Global, not even remotely, but it works! And in the grand scheme of things, its definitely the type of tune which would receive an airplay in the states. It flows rather simply over a hip hop beat, and I can imagine it would appeal to hip hop fans and just something exactly the savviest of the savvy at VP would choose to set up to record for the album. The album's other combination is just downright brilliance as the self proclaimed `Fireman' (and I can think of another excellent combination now that VP might want to set up for the next album) teams up with reggae legend Freddie McGregor on One Family. The tune is of course lyrically a reggae tune, but it is built over a pop like or popso styled riddim and it works in just about every way, with Garlin doing very well and McGregor proving all his years of experience has made him capable of just about anything musically.There are bad things going on with Global (and I thought I'd get it out before talking about the album's real magic). First and foremost is Fire fi Dem. Through no fault of his own (besides voicing the riddim) Fire fi Dem is marred by virtue of being recorded over the ridiculously bad and annoying Wipeout riddim. Also not cool on Global is the presence of 3 tracks. Firstly, and not so bad is Put in de Ting which flows over the Scoobay riddim. . . Which by my count is now 3 years old; then there's Get Up, Stand Up, with dancehall collective T.O.K. which is about 4 years old, and lastly there's a near slap in the face by including the album's closer Hands Up. . . Which you can also find on the Soca Gold 2002 album! All of the songs are pretty well done (although I'm flat out tired of Get Up, Stand Up by now). It would have been nice had Garlin had to go into his bag of tricks and pull out some newer material strictly for the album it harkens back to late 90's style of dancehall album making where the album was much more of a compilation than an actual album because either all or most of the tracks had previously been released.Nevertheless, thankfully the good on Global far outweighs the bad. The certain highest point on Global is the opener, the MASSIVE No Super Hero. No Super Hero offers the listener just about everything that is great about Garlin. Besides being the high paces and crazy tune on which he made his name, should you at any point on any verse slow it down and listen to exactly what is being said you'll understand Garlin's odd cleverness which shows he is maybe amongst the best in all of soca. Check the succeeding track as well, the nice nice Pan and Soca, which is just about as straight soca Global goes. The song incorporates a nice pan drum while being wrapped in a very large and thumping soca riddim and Garlin puts it through its paces in his typically building vibes style. Speaking of `typical' Bunji, as opposed to `typical' anyone else, check the ridiculously heavy We Maniacs. We Maniacs is something for the PURE socaheads out there and its easily one of the album's best definitely nice that it was included on Global and I imagine were the album released during Carnival (which might be a good idea for the next one) it would have been an official single, as it is expect it to be in even greater rotation on the Soca mixtapes and compilations circuit than it already was as a pre-release, definitely love We Maniacs!Other good tracks worth checking out on Global include the title track. The Global riddim by Firelinks was a very very odd one. When the riddim album was released and you saw exactly who the eccentric (to say the least) Firelinks had linked to voice it, it even got stranger, but between the 2 successful artists to ride the riddim, to my memory, Bunji was one definitely as the nearly completely soca riddim was of course right up his area of expertise. Globally the track (I guess they discovered that the shortened version worked better as an album title) is very very nice as well. Check Blaze it Up as well, probably the best hook on the entire album and yet another song with the nice building vibes and a rather perfect example of a ragga-soca track as the cadence and melody in the track is pure soca (or something you might hear from Soltex at Asylum) but the riddim itself is definitely out of the dancehall, but very nice track at the same time. Also check the one combination which I never mentioned, Hardcore Loving with Trini songbird Rita Jones who always does a nice job. Hardcore Loving is a track that evens out Global a little bit, always nice to hear a dominant female voice on a male album, and I'm happy that this is the one that VP chose to include instead of pushing a Garlin combination with a dancehall singer. I have to say something about Brrrt too! The album's first official single over Massive B's March Out riddim (again, a very soca-ish riddim) is a song that I go back and forth on, it can get very annoying or very addictive, very quickly, but right now its addictive, so definitely check that one out, although if you've read this far you've probably heard it already.Overall, Global is a big big album. Not only musically, but for what it means. This is one of the first times on an album that a big time pure soca artist will receive the type of promotion generally granted to his dancehall peers. And, as I mentioned, there are certainly more marketable soca talents out there, but definitely glad that VP chose to put that force behind Bunji's project. Should it do well, or even decent, I imagine (and expect) others to follow suit, bringing even further exposure to one of the strangest and strongest musical vibes in the entire world.And on a side note, also check out The Book of Angels from soca enigma Machel Montano, just recently released, VERY huge album on JW Records (and wouldn't it be so nice if VP, or Greensleeves would pick up the international distribution) definitely an album to hear if you like the vibes on Global.

Before I heard the Diwali, the best one rhythm or 'version' album that I'd heard was the Juice from VP's Riddim Driven seies, but the Diwali blows the Juice away. The vibe that it pulls is just so strong and it flat out ruled Jamaican and likewise worldwide dancehalls. As far as the album, it is absolutely devoid of bad tunes (which for me, is saying a lot because i am not a fan at all of some of the artists on i.e. Wyane Marshall, Dany English, Bling Dawg amd Zumjay (even Hawkeye) and their tunes are at least standable I even like Marshall's Overcome which is a good tune devoid of his signature annoying "CHOO CHOO CHOO") you can just play the album and walk away. Oddly enough my absolute favorite tune might be the final track which is just the riddim itself playing with a unique mix, close your eyes and listen and it conjures up all kinda fantastic imagery (an amazing vibe). The thing that sets this album apart from alll of the other one rhythm sets that I've purchased (i.e. the Juice, Bad Kalic, Liquid, Ghetto Slam etc.)is the producer's, Steven "Lenky" Marsden's, attention to detail. There is a base riddim and nearly every tune has a mix off of it, which certainly makes for an easier listen for non-dancehall fans that are not accustomed to artists voicing on the same backing track. Lenky's mixes makes nearly every tune unique in itself. My favorite lyrics on the riddim are nearly them all, however, standouts, the best of the best, include Bounty Killer's ultra tight Sufferah, Tanya Stephen's Can't Touch Me No More, perhaps my favorite Elephant Man tune ever- Elephant Message, CeiCile's Respect Yuh Wife, the Dr.'s That's Right, Spragga's Gonna Fight, TOK's Galang Gal, and Anthony B's Girls Buss. However, my absolute favorite has to be No Letting Go by Wayne Wonder, that is the best tune bar none that I have heard in '02, and it, at the time of my writing this is on top of many dancehall & reggae charts around the world (as was BK's Sufferah at one point). I also like Ruffest and Tuffest by the upcoming Assassin. Overall, I say definitely pick this one up. Several of my friends who I know don't listen to dancehall music regularly have purchased this one and they enjoy it thoroughly. It is rather hardcore patois, so you might want to consider that before you buy it, if you don't really understand the dialect, then don't make this your first venture in to reggae music. But besides this, there is nothing keeping me from recommending this one. This riddim just has a fantastic vibe. If music is playing when I die, I hope its the Diwali.AMAZING!

So many times an riddim album or a 'version' album (as they old folk call it) like this just won't work as a complete album because either the producer outshine's the artists he or she has voiced on the big riddim for the most part(such as the Sleepy Dog); Or the complete opposite, a producer will soend big and get big artists who are the top of the line but can't ride their awful or odd sounding riddim (i.e. the Ice Cube riddim album).However, when both the artists and producer can bring their A game and work together, the result is very very entertaining. Such is the case with this big riddim which nearly locked off the dance in 2003 with several big big tunes, and a few more are present here which did very little business, if any, but are still quality tunes.The Bad Company riddim was made by Scatta, former in house producer for the Kings of Kings outfit. Scatta is the same mastermind behind such smashes as the Double Jeopardy, the Martial Arts and probably his biggest riddim to date, the Coolie Dance. Scatta continues to be a force in the dancehall and has turned to management and other ventures and has remained viable even outside of the studio.The strength in the Bad Company is its bounciness. Its very very easy to ride, very listenable. Thus you get some of the best melodic tunes from artists who aren't not necessarily known as being melodic. The most robotic and mechanical of artists can bring a nice melody over the Bad Company riddim no problem, even if they can't! The riddim creates one for them.The best tune here is probably Beenie Man's Hand Up Deh! Yes I'm calling that the best tune here, who knew that song 3 years later would be the point of much controversy for the King, but the song was massive when it dropped. The nature of the BC allows for the dance song as well so you see Beenie score well again with Row Like a Boat and Ele as well with one of his bigger hits Chiney Ting. Both vets Buju and Bounty Killa hit massively on their People & People and Nah Trace respectively, 2 really big tunes no doubt.I also really really enjoy Degree being himself on Wine Gal Wine, Assassin and Kartel being less melodic (but again, the riddim creates one for them) on their nice Do Ma Thing and What's the Deal respectively. Of course Kalonji does well on the tune chosen for the name of the riddim and Ce'cile does her buddy Scatta fine with her effort More Than One Time.3 of the best songs surprisingly come later on the album with super underrated lyrics factory Madd Anju doing his typical thing under the radar on the excellent Wa Do Dem. I also enjoy the pretty average Jagwa on Dishonour, really strong tune from the still young artist. Then you get Merciless! When a riddim can make the long past his prime Merciless look good you know you have a winner! And his gyal tune Tek Wuk locks into the Bad Company easy easy like anything for a few years before (and the 3 since!), one of his best tunes. . . ever!Overall, definitely pick this one up. This was a big riddim when it came out and some of these tunes, mainly Beenie's, still score well in the dancehalls. Typical modern dancehall production, done really really well by one of the genre's true young masters in Scatta.

Now it wasn't that long ago when 2 big young artists buss on the scene and the dancehall world was wondering who exactly would be the one to take the music to the next level after the (seemingly) inevitable passing of the guard from such legends as Beenie Man and Bounty Killa.One of those young artists was a rather odd looking lyrics machine named Vybz Kartel who garnered mass attention based on his supernatural martian styled flow and off the mic controversies. The other was a tall gangly looking kid named who had become a legend in JA highschools for his penchant for drumming up lyrics off the top of his head for just about anything named Assassin.While we got Kartel's debut about 2 years ago, we now see that the early lead which he enjoyed between the two has shrunk to absolutely nothing.Assassin's real strength is his versatility and Infiltration does nothing if not showing the absolute dexterity which the young artist enjoys which will be an infinite advantage over most of his younger and older peers (Kartel included). It features his most recent hits from the dance, including Step Pon Dem, Idiot Thing, Girls Gone Wild and the flat out awesome As a Man all of which are straight hammers in the dance, it also boasts newer songs such as We Dem Want (which is one of my favorite), Gangsta City over superproducer Lenky's newest riddim (he was so impressed by the tune obviously that he dubbed the riddim the Gangsta City and a fine tune in Dem.The real story on Infiltration is, however, is the attention of the artist to developing his more rootical side. He tips his hand of what is to come on track 7, Free At Last, which plays out wonderfully! The closer of the album, Respect Due is nearly the best of them all, as the very young Assassin calls out the forefathers of reggae music from Yellowman to Uroy and from Black Uhuru to the Heptones. The album also features a wonderful and unlikely combination of Assassin with dancehall legend Freddie McGregor on which the young artist more than holds his own. The best tune of them all however, is Wandering Mind on which Assassin tackles some of the hardest flows he's ever displayed on current events and just waxes poetically throughout the tune, it is truly one of the best tunes I've EVER heard, Wandering Mind is huge!Overall, although if I remember correctly, I rated Kartel's debut higher (largely due to the anticipation of it) Infiltration is exactly that. Its an infiltration of the highest order and you aren't left unsatisfied at all. I wouldn't at all be surprised to see 'Sassin go completely Rasta and roots in the future (much like his mentor Spragga Benz), he definitely has the overall ability to, and he definitely has the overall ability to manage to get me to more than advise you to buy his debut album, I'll be waiting on the followup!

While I don't think I'll ever write enough of these to the point where I will actually begin to COMPLAIN that this artist or that artist is simply putting out TOO MUCH material (if I were I think i would have already gotten there between Sizzla's, Anthony B's, Luciano's and Turbulence's insane release schedules). However, the problem occurs when an album is released with virtually NO promotion, to the extent that possibly the artist himself doesn't even know of its existence and is unable to mention it during any of the countless interviews he goes through.Such is the case of Anthony B's latest album for the notoriously bad Penitentiary Records (and whose numerous detractions I'm almost tired of mentioning, but feel free to check any of their other albums which I THINK I may have mentioned something about their incompetence in reviewing), Gather & Come. The album is the followup to 2005's Confused Times which was a very similar album in terms of what was good, what's wrong.Both Confused Times and now Gather & Come are closer to the harder side of dancehall albums (as far as Anthony B goes to complete dancehall, not as hard as Assassin or Kartel, but hard for the artist). I do have to give Anthony B credit, although the label fails with the album, Anthony B is his typically consistent self and absolutely BLAZES several of these tracks, its just a complete shame that he wasted some of this fine ammunition on an album which will see so very little light of day.The best track here is probably the ultra aggressive (almost hip-hoppish) Bad fi Who? The song calls out so called bad men and is typical Anthony B sort of stop and go style where he'll build a vibes and back off of it giving it time to reach the peaka and set it up very nicely. And although I might be very critical of Gather & Come as an album, as I mentioned, it is very very solid. Several of the songs are worth checking out on their own merits.Definitely check Pomps & Pride, a remake of the classic with an uncredited (of course he's uncredited, its Penitentiary) singer who may or may not actually be Toots himself (and of course the song is mispelled Pumps & Pride on the album). With Anthony's vibes on the track, it still works and is a very interesting and nice combination. I love the obligatory weedman tune Herbs People, big big track which definitely deserves a few spins. I like the closing 2 tracks as well, both from Downsound Productions with the solid Bun Dem and You're So Fine over the Maroon and Invasion riddims, respectively.Even a few more tracks worth vibing still: Let Down over the solid solid and well powerful Mr Greedy riddim; Check the wicked wicked title track over the same refashioning of the Sleng Teng which Capleton rode on his fire and brimstone condemnatory Pure Sodom. I'd also recommend Anthony B's new election tune (and he's made some fine ones in the past) Election Time over the same beautiful and vibrant riddim which spawned Queen Omega's divine I Believe in Love; and lastly the nice nice somber Woman Love Vanity. Woman Love Vanity is getting to the more current style of love song which Anthony B writes (not too disimilar from I'll Understand from the Black History album), and it is truly excellent.Overall, I'll very grudgingly recommend this assuredly hard to find album. Its solid, as all Anthony B's albums are, but this one is even a little sharper than Confused Times was. From beginning to end, Gather & Come is top notch. HOWEVER! Also released at around the same time was Anthony B's MASSIVE Suffering Man album from TADS label, far more a respectable outfit than Penitentiary will ever be. And should you be faced with the choice between the two, definitely air on the side of Suffering Man. Suffering Man is a slightly better piece and you won't feel dirty for enjoying it, knowing all its material was recorded strictly for it.

It took dancehall group Ward 21 just under 3 and a half years to rid themselves of a much less than desireable contract with reggae giant label Greensleeves. There last album, U Know How We Roll was released in 2003 and as a fully functional and self-sufficient group (i.e. they can make their own riddims in their own studio and voice their own songs there as well) an album every 2-3 years was far too infrequent for their tastes (as well as Greensleeves ALLEDGEDLY just bad management, this year alone they've lost Fantan Mojah and their biggest attraction, Vybz Kartel has threatened to leave, and neither is Macka Diamond too happy). So they have taken their act on the road.Oddly enough, they have landed at JVC Japan, and while releasing albums for japanese labels has been a more and more frequent approach for many artists (just in the last year both Voicemail and Daville have released their debuts in Japan), the ultra high-profile Ward 21 doesn't seem like a pretty good fit being 'banished' to Japan with an album that is way less than readily available in the west (or even here in Jamaica!).And be it stress or uncertainty or whatever it is, it shows in the music. This, their 3rd album in all seems ridiculously low-key when compared to its two predecessors. The music, on a large scale is much more laid back and 'NORMAL'. They named themselves Ward 21 after the mental health wing of a local hospital, however, King of the World comes off as the whole ward has taken a MASSIVE dosage of valium. It just doesn't cut it, they seem to fight the temptation of completely blowing their tops through the entire album, however, they need to know that is what makes them so great.The few times they do, or sometime manage to step up in another way, you can see the talent is still there. The best song here is probably the rather clever Please over the TIRED Steps riddim although on either of their 2 previous albums it would definitely be unable to rank in the top 5 tracks, thats what we're working with on KotW. The title track is pretty much sub-average, over the equally tired Slow Bounce riddim which is well over 2 years old.The good tracks are few and far between but definitely one of the best is Weed We Love, one of the purely melodical tracks on KotW. But here is where the negatives far outweigh the positives: Check May I over the 2 year old Military riddim which is basically a cover of a Snoop Dog song; Come Baby Come, a cover of the old K7 song, and is really bad; Full Up, with Wayne Marshall which was probably out at the time of their last album.Overall, King of the World is just a complete let down! I went into it thinking, finally they're off the label which they had spent the last 3-4 years unhappy with and out to do what they want, and they dipped into some of the least entertaining material in their entire catalogue in putting out a wholeheartedly disappointment of an album. Material like this suggests that maybe the members all need to seek new Wards.

There is a rather small group of artists who I hold close to my mind and far from decks. These are artists who I was once a fan (or in some cases a 'semi-fan') of who have continued to record, but for some reason or another, I have just grown to dislike (or maybe even despise) musically. Approximately every five years or so, I'll add, roughly, 2-3 artists to this list and getting off of this list is a TERRIBLY difficult thing to do (unless you are Morgan Heritage). Th elist currently includes once great, now annoying, hardcore dancehall dj Cutty Ranks; never great and still not pillars of mediocrity Don Yute and Alleycat and. . . I dont know what to call him, Mad Lion. All have been added to the list by virtue of releasing an album which I had great hope for but fell so flat, my nose bleeds when thinking about it.Such was the case, I supposed, in 2005 when the oddly voiced Xterminator artist (and St Ann's native, biggup St Ann's!) Desbert Johnson, bka Chezidek, dropped his second album for Xterminator/VP, Rising Sun. Following 2002's absolutely wonderful Harvest Time (which still manages to find its way to my cdplayer even today) I was greatly looking forward to Rising Sun, which. . . I just dont know, but RS proved to be one of the oddest reggae releases I've heard outside of a dub album. And when you go with odd vibes with an already unusual sound (in the vocal style Chezidek sings in), that can prove to be a lethal combination.Fast forward 2 short years and having caught word sound that Chezidek had expanded his vibes to record for the nice roots outfit Al.Ta.fa.an on top of a fine year which included his first JA #1 tune, Leave the Trees (which oddly enough just missed the Rising Sun album), I decided to pick up the product of those works, Mash Dem Down (also have to give credit to a very insistent salesperson in a St Maarten recordshop). The album was acually somewhat of a cult-favorite on the reggae circuit with several smaller media outlets including it in the year end discussions of best reggae albums of 2006.While I wouldn't go that far, I will declare that Mash Dem Down has more or less, single handedly save me from shutting out this wonderful artist. I will always maintain that Chezidek's style is something which requires a bit of getting used to (i.e. at least listen to some clips before picking it up, if not an entire album) this album and Harvest Time puts all fans of modern roots reggae on notice to start getting used to Chezidek. Mash Dem Down is excellent and goes to establish not only Chezidek but the now well respected Al.ta.fa.an label as international powerhouses on the reggae scene.Mash Dem Down is a fitting album to be the first (hopefully in a line of many) album released on the label, and it brings some truly powerful vibes. Check the strongest, and the album's signature track, Only the Strong over the Security riddim. Only the Strong is a powerfully wonderful track featuring underrated and overlooked Kingston singer Mark Wonder (check out his latest album, Break the Ice as well) as well as Al.ta.fa.an favorite Lutan Fyah (hopefully the artist on the label's #2 album release). The combination is as unusual, bringing together 3 artists at an up and coming stage, but who sound virtually nothing alike, Chezidek with his sky high vocals, Wonder sounding like a more laxed version of Yami Bolo and Fyah bringing the pure chanting vibes, definitely the track alone is worth the prise of admission.Another odd combination is Don't You, which is a rare love song combination between Chezidek and German star (and another label favorite) Gentleman. The song takes several spins to grow on you as its minimalistic production almost vibes itself as an acapella track, but eventually you'll see the real power of the track. The other combination on Mash Dem Down is very strong as well. Dem Nah Good features veteran JA dj, as well as a mentor of Chezidek's, Prezident Brown. Dem Nah Good is more typical of a combination in high voiced singer and baritone voiced dj style, and it works (even moreso than Don't Go).If Only the Strong is the album's signature track then the riddim backing the excellent I and I is easily the album's signature riddim. The Tsahai riddim, named after Lutan Fyah's daughter birthed the MASSIVE Receive by Junior Kelly, which is to date Al.ta.fa.an's biggest hit, it also backed several other nice tracks (such as Perfect's nice nice Astalavista). Check the nice nice Bruck Like Crackery which goes about as melodic as Chezidek gets by adding excellent backing singers which makes the vibes very high, again, almost sounding like an acapella vibes.Other tunes worth spins include the powerful Fi Wah. Fi Wah almost sounds like the big vibe which came off the Harvest Time album, it might have fit very well there. However, even more powerful here perhaps, as it is one of the very few tracks which get your head bopping. Also well fond of the opening and title track which gets the album started off so nice and just makes you want top listen to the rest of it, and on an album which you're not so sure about, that can be very important. And lastly, I'd be doing you a downright disservice if I didnt mention the nice joyful Leggo Dutty Babylon Ways, which if I remember correctly, was one of the singles from Mash Dem Down. Its just a joy to listen to!Overall, Mash Dem Down is just a joy to listen to! While I'm not ready to proclaim it the finest piece of reggae music I've ever listened to (despite by rather joyous review) I think its a very good piece, particularly for an artist at the stage of his career that Chezidek is. Its very critical to put out good solid material for all those fans heading to the shelves to see what else is good behind Leave the Trees.

Cocoa Tea is a very unusual singer. Cocoa Tea is probably the only person in the world that I know of that has the type of voice with which he could probably speak of flat out impending doom and yet strangely enough make all of his listeners feel good. It sounds like he records at his house, outside, just sitting around just reasoning or something singing all of his songs, it just so happens that everytime he does a full recording studio magically appears!Having recently become a huge fan of the artist (of course i knew of his music, but didnt really invest in it too much until now)Tek Weh Yuh Gal is MASSIVE! Armed with what may or may not prove to be the biggest hit of his career Cocoa Tea has put up one of the biggest albums that I've heard in a long time. Of course you have the title track, which is pretty much a funny song, but its a feel good song on top of that (there is a difference), but then you have the wicked combinations with Anthony B (on of the album's best efforts) on Dance Hall Nice, a typically highly animated Kalonji on the Kushenpeng inspired Pass It Over; and a wicked combination with CUTTY RANKS! On top of the combinations, you have CT's usually high level material, the two opening songs on this album before the title cut are wonderful, love both Sunshine (which is nearly an imperial tune) and Have It Fi Mi.Overall, like I said, this album is huge. There exists a point on this album where I pretty much lost it, it was so good that I forgot where I was, I feel asleep and dreamt that I was at a concert somewhere, the vibe here is that strong. Big album from a truly big artist.On a side note, this is the second recent hit from rising Rasta label Kings of Kings, he first being label head, Iley Dread's Unite the People from 2003, both through VP Records, I hope to see more similar releases, Kings of Kings are apparently clueless as to how to make bad music.GO GET IT!

I had very high hopes for 2007. The year, which began as potentially one of the biggest in recent memory for not only fans of reggae music, but fans of all forms of Caribbean music, hasn't disappointed none at all. Besides the rather controversial manner in which the Cricket World Cup played out, the vibes here have been at an all time high. When reggae music is at it's best, or when soca music is at its best, with the top notch artists making the top notch vibes, there is no greater region in the world and one could clearly claim, that at least for recent years, within the past decade or so, 2007 has been a standard bearer, an all around excellent year for vibes. For those very few of us who actually buy reggae albums (and I do mean `FEW') 2007 has also been a spectacular year with such a wide and varying array of artists reaching with releases already and still many more to come. When the year began the few that were at the time known: There were to be all but certain releases from such artists as Richie Spice, Spragga Benz, Ras Shiloh, Natural Black, Chuck Fenda and perhaps most anticipated, Lady Saw's return with what turned out to be the very very solid, Walk Out. Still even more were released as the year has progressed such as offerings from the cast of `usual suspects, i.e. Sizzla, Luciano, Turbulence (all of whom have made multiple releases in 2007), Lutan Fyah and Anthony B, as well as others like Bunji Garlin representing for soca, another Natural Black album (three in all this year. . . ), Jah Mason and Chezidek, and that's just the first half of 2007. The second half, while it figures to have a bit less in terms of quality does boast potential releases from such reggae giants as Bounty Killer, Elephant Man, Wayne Wonder, Assassin and perhaps the grandest prize of them all of 2007, a potential release from Capleton in late 2007 (and I'd be downright shocked if Sizzla reached the end of the year with a `pedestrian' two releases). Another nice twist for the year is the potentiality of several very nice and very high profile debuts from young artists. The first of note was May's release of (BROWN's TOWN native) Ras Myrhdak (BIGGUP ST. ANN'S MASSIVE!) on his well powerful debut, Prince of Fyah and just recently dancehall singer Mavado tripped up the vibes with his scalding debut Gangsta For Life. In the offering for the rest of the year, potentially, are debuts from the likes of Aidonia, Munga Honourable and the long overdue Ce'cile album, (as well as the first `free` debut of soon to be released singer Jah Cure). Other nice finds even still brim outside the normal radius of reggae, including releases from Josie Mel and Cocoa Tea, and the official releasing of Tony Rebel's I-Rebel and Queen Ifrica's debut album, Fyah Muma, you almost have to be impressed with the vibes of 2007.All that being said, one of the single most anticipated releases for me personally comes in the form of one of the freshest breaths of air dancehall has seen in quite some time. The US born, Jamaican blooded and grown Alaine Laughton has established herself as THE current female dancehall singer of preference in the past two years following such wonderful names as Chevelle Franklyn and Nadine Sutherland (who herself has a nice album this year as well, the excellent Call My Name and arguably sharing the role with Ce'cile who sings almost as much as she DJ's). Guided by one of the finest young minds and production talents in the music, Donovan `Vendetta' Bennett, the young singer has made her name backed by some of the most lush and fluid riddims of this generation, Alaine has made a beautiful style of music which is accessible to both reggae fans, and MUSIC fans alike. Her music even more so blends the r&b; stylized dancehall with more mainstream vibes, although she is seemingly just as comfortable riding hardcore riddims (most notably those produced by Vendetta and young dancehall production trio, Daseca) which are likewise given to some of the harshest male dancehall DJ's in the game, like Vybz Kartel and Busy Signal. I myself have rather enjoyed Alaine's rise to prominence, particularly as she has mixed and collaborated with some of the more hardcore styles of dancehall. I cannot tell you how many compilations have been saved by Alaine's vibes! Through listening to riddim albums and other hardcore compilations, an Alaine tune can blend in with the rest on a riddim and yet not interfere at all with the overall vibes of a riddim. Check either of Vendetta's riddims, the Sweat of the Justice albums as evidence of Alaine giving a nice woman`s touch to some of the more harsh dancehall riddims. On the other side, the softer more rootical vibes is where Alaine truly excels and exactly what she does on that type of vibes is DEFINITELY something to hear. Drawing a line which is closer to her dancehall counterparts than her more rootical ones, Alaine creates GEMS of romantic and laid back songs which had been missing for quite awhile in the dance. The dancehall love song is a song which is always appreciated, but many of its greatest performers in recent times, most notably the legendary Beres Hammond, haven't been as active or accessible as one would hope (wouldn't it be soooooooooo nice if Beres would put out an album yearly?) and not to mention that many have been. . . Men. Alaine represents ultra consistently (and she has a very very nice song with Beres, Love Sound, which will probably be included in his next album) for the women, arguably making some of the strongest lover's material seen in the dancehall in quite a long time. She is very active, very consistent, and if you can't tell, I kind of like her just a little!Taking the Japanese route as many of her peers have in recent years, Alaine brings forth her highly anticipated debut album for Avex Records of Japan. Apparently the label, along with another Japanese label, Victor, has some sort of working relationship with western reggae giant VP Records as they both have been at the helm of several very anticipated albums as of late, most recently, in March, hardcore dancehall veteran Spragga Benz made his long awaited return with the album Live Good (which I'm still trying to get down here); also in recent years, VP artists Da'Ville and Voicemail have made their true debuts months before making their `debuts ` with the label itself on Japanese labels and dancehall production group Ward 21 FINALLY returned last year with their third album, the awful King of the World, also for a Japanese label. Alaine takes the same road with her Sacrifice, named after her MASSIVE current hit of the same title. Of course, the album is produced by Vendetta with the majority of productions coming from Vendetta and "Daseca". What would be the real complaint here, as is the case with many reggae albums released internationally is that Sacrifice is full of older songs. Any fan would most likely already be familiar with roughly 90% of sixteen tracked Sacrifice. However, unlike many other albums built on the same practice, what can be said about sacrifice is that most of the songs here are not only just good songs, but are PROVEN hits. And if you are fan of the artist, much like myself, you really won't mind too much (and I know that's sounding a little two faced considering I ripped several albums, including Ward 21's for having albums which were old and stale a full year before they were actually released because Alaine makes such wonderfully beautiful material. Then there's her voice! In reggae you have very few artists whose tone is more applicable to the style of music which they make, definitely Beres Hammond falls into that category as his cool and docile vocals flow effortlessly over his. . . Cool and docile songs; Alaine's laid back, yet strong voice which has several levels beyond what she typically uses is custom fit to her songs of varying degrees an styles.My favourite Alaine song is also my choice for Sacrifice's best offering and its saying a lot because, as I mentioned, the album Is full of hits. Vendetta's Season's riddim is the backdrop for one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard as the songbird creates a vibe so strong on her No Ordinary Love, that it is fully my intention to play the song at my wedding! No Ordinary Love, despite her career to date and developing in the future is sure to be Alaine's signature love song. It was one of the finest songs on the riddim which is saying a lot as even the riddim itself, full of hits like Jah Cure's epic Love Is, Wayne Wonder's excellent I Believe, Sean Paul's international hit Never Gonna Be the Same and Natural Black's Jamaican #1 hit, Far From Reality; Alaine's No Ordinary Love more than holds its own with any of those tracks. The `supporting' cast is full of tracks which I probably voted as the best tracks on any given number of compilations over the past couple of years. One such a track is Deeper! Deeper is a song with an abundance of beauty, it could lend some beauty to another song, and still be a beautiful track! It was one of her bigger hits and having had the opportunity and utter joy of seeing Alaine perform the song live, it loses none of its luster in live situation. Another such song is the gorgeous Rise In Love over Arif Cooper's equally gorgeous Guardian Angel riddim, if this album were released two or three months ahead of when it actually was, it probably would have been titled Rise in Love, a very fitting titled to the album still and somewhat a term by which Alaine's entire career has projected to the head of dancehall. And there's also Heavenly! Over Vendetta's riddim of the same title and despite the presence of Richie Spice's excellent hit, Brown Skin, rather easily the best track on the riddim. Currently Alaine is riding high with the title track. The song was a one-off for producer Vendetta who pushed it greatly making it arguably the biggest hit of her career to date. Sacrifice actually leaves the arena where I could simply call it `beautiful' or `lovely' and armed with a wonderfully done video, directed by local video kingpin Ras Kassa, I would call the song, sexy, first and foremost, it is a song, love will be made to!On the other side, the harsher side of the vibes, check Anything,. Anything flows easily over Daseca's Anger Management riddim (which was the same riddim which backed Full Clip from Busy Signal and Mavado, and Mavado's own signature track, Real McKoy, and she feels just as home over the vibe as her bullet crazy male peers scoring a shot which ranks amongst the albums best and the riddim makes virtually no changes or accommodations to Alaine, but she shifts her own vibes to fit it. Check Wine, an earlier hit from the singer over Vendetta's Sweat riddim and I remember in reviewing the album for the Sweat riddim saying how a couple of the newcomers had actually outshined their well veteran counterparts (the other being Alaine label mate Munga). Her newest dancehall shot comes over Vendetta's Back Ache riddim with Ya Ya (I Want It) which is a nice mix up with the vibes as it shows Alaine genuinely having a fun with the riddim, it almost comes off as a complete freestyle with her going to Spanish even at times. And check Make Me Weak which rides the same infectious Smash riddim made famous by Tony Matterhorn's Dutty Wine.From the newer material on Sacrifice check Earth Cry which is probably the song which best shows Alaine's true lovely voice in all of its forms over a smooth acoustic riddim. The song builds nicely over its 3:44 and she blows the lid off her voice nicely at least once during its course. And Keep Loving You, one of Sacrifice's stronger tracks built over a bubbly but laid back "Daseca" track (and listen to the first second of the track to see why I call it "Daseca"). The album fittingly ends with a very nice remix of the title track which incorporates more of a jazz sound into the vibes and of course, the track still works.I'm definitely recommending Sacrifice, not only to reggae fans and fans of Alaine's but to r & b fans as well. I can definitely Alaine's vibes being appreciated in the r & b/ pop genres as well and just anyone who really enjoys strong music. Of course it helps if you love reggae, this is still Jamaican music, albeit with a slightly progressive sound. Of course, I admit to my own partiality, I'm a large fan of Alaine's and having had the pleasure of meeting the singer I can say that she's a nice person as well. Do yourself a favour, pick up her NICE album.
