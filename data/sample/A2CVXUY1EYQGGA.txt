The Third Secret is one of three books by Steve Berry that I own, but it's the only one I've read ... and could possibly be the last. I tried to get into this book four different times but could never get past the first 75 pages. The best part of reading this book was that it served the same purpose as taking a sleeping pill. Each time I picked up it allowed me to fall asleep within ten minutes. A better name for The Third Secret would have been Ambien ... The Book. Virtually nothing happened in the limited time I read the book,the plot moved at a snail's pace and the characters did not hold my interest. The old saying about books defintely applies as an argument for not reading The Secret Secret, i.e., so many books, so little time. Do yourself a big favor and avoid any temptation you might have to read this book. It ultimately will serve as a waste of your valuable time, not to mention a waste of your money. The only reason stopping me from giving this book a 1-star rating is my guilt in not spending more time to give The Third Secret a chance to improve. However, for me, the secret about this book was already out of the bag, so to speak. That is, that after 75 pages it was no secret that The Third Secret was a real snoozer.

Brokaw deserves credit for providing a major tribute to a generation that for too long has been underappreciated. Unfortunately, people in their late 70s and older are just seen -- particularly by Gen Xers and Gen Yers -- as OLD; with most of us having little understanding of the sacrifices and contributions they made towards making America what it is today. I agree with Brokaw that the WWII generation may be the greatest generation in America's history for the various reasons he cites in his book. As a book, however,The Greatest Generation, while interesting, does not fulfill the promise I was anticipating. Basically, what Brokaw has done is provide a series of short, somewhat fluffy chronicles of the lives of WWII veterans from various cross-sections of the United States. While these chronicles, as I said, are interesting, they do not provide enough depth and insight into how these individuals' wartime achievements contributed to what they accomplished after the war. Nonetheless, The Greatest Generation is a book worth reading for the main value it provides -- making each of the post-WWII generations understand and appreciate better a generation which, sadly, will not be with us for too much longer.

In his first novel, Grant Sutherland has produced a well-written, highly suspenseful (albeit slow-building) thriller about a murder that takes place at the United Nations. In addition to its well-developed plot,which is packed with twists and surprises, Sutherland's characters are believable and multi-dimensional. In many ways, Diplomatic Immunity reminds me of the early works by Robert Ludlum, which, to me, is a high compliment. If you're a thriller lover, or any reader who is seeking a very good book, Diplomatic Immunity is definitely worthy of your consideration. I'm very much looking forward to Sutherland's next book.

Having read all three of Glenn Meade's books, his latest represents a slump for this talented author. The Sands Of Sakkara is not a bad book; in fact, it is an entertaining read, though fairly predictable. Comparatively, however, an unfortunate trend appears to be emerging with Meade. His latest is not as good as his previous book, Brandenburg, and Brandenburg is not as good as his first,Snow Wolf. To me, Snow Wolf is one of the best historical thrillers I''ve read in many years.

I had anticipated that The Last Juror was going to be like what I found many of Grisham's other books to be -- a suspenseful, legal thriller. The Last Juor is none of these things. It is not suspenseful and it is not thrilling. What it is, however, is one of Grisham's best books from a more literary standpoint. The Last Juror is primarily about what life in a small town in Mississippi was like during the 1970s told from the perspective of the new owner of the local newspaper, 23-year old Willie Traynor. Grisham covers important events from that time period, including religion, racism, segregation, economic concerns and the Vietnam war. Based on the description in the jacket cover about a rape/murder and the fact that the story takes place in the same town (Clanton) as his first, and excellent, book, A Time To Kill, I expected The Last Juror to be one of his better legal thrillers. Despite my not getting what I expected, I enjoyed Grisham's latest book, and found he's grown considerably in his ability to convey warmth and sentiment and to create strong, true-to-life, multi-dimensional characters. If you can overcome the fact that this is not the typical Grisham legal thriller, I think you will enjoy The Last Juror. If, however, you won't be satisfied without the usual amount of suspense, action and surprises on which Grisham has built his enormous reputation, then you should avoid this book. The Last Juror is not Grisham's best book by far, but it is worth reading. If you decide to read this book, I hope you enjoy it.

In The Prince of Beverly Hills Woods has introduced a new main character, Rick Barron, who rises from being a demoted police detective to a big career in the movie industry. In his book, which takes place between the late 1930's-early 1940's, Woods weaves the right amount of interesting characters, history and excitement that results in a very enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced story. The Prince of Beverly Hills is the perfect type of book for a plane ride, vacation or for when you just want something light 'escape' reading that will keep you turning the pages and engrossed. If you're looking for something heavier and thought-provoking to read, I'd suggest that you skip this book. My one criticism with The Prince of Beverly Hills -- and it's a minor one -- is the ease with which everything good falls into the leading character's lap. Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to the next book featuring Rick Barron.

There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as "the greatest love story of our time," it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come.

The Panasonic Lumix TZ3, a 7.2-megapixel digital camera featuring its 10x optical zoom (i.e., the equivalent of 28mm-280mm) and image stabilzation is an excellent value for the money. It's relatively compact and lightweight (though a bit bigger and heavier than some cameras with shorter zoom capabilities) and offers a wide range of shooting modes to make picture taking very easy and virtually error-free. And, most importantly, the quality of the digital images taken with the Panasonic Lumix Leica lens, is exceptional. I highly recommend the TZ3, especially if having a broad zoom range is important to you.

Although Katzenbach has become one of my favorite authors, you can tell that The Traveler is only his second book.While the story is interesting, his dialogue is weak and he doesn't move the story along at a fast enough pace. He's come a long way since The Traveler. If you like really good thrillers, try these books by Katzenbach--Hart's War (his latest), The Shadow Man and Just Cause.

What if FDR didn't die of a brain aneurism but was really assassinated? That is the premise of David L. Robbins' latest historical thriller. The Assassins Gallery is very fast-paced and suspenseful, while blending in some interesting historical information about assassins, FDR's private life and some thought-provoking issues. All in all, Robbins's writing style will keep you glued to your seat to find out what happens next ... but, with the exception of the ending, you'll probably be able to accurately predict a lot of what happens. This, however, will not detract from this exciting thriller. The one major criticism I did have with The Assassins Gallery, and which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating, is the relative ease with which the main "good" character is able to determine what the assassin is planning to do as well as of the relative ease with which the "bad" character, the assassin, is able to manipulate everyone she comes in contact with. Nonetheless, The Assassins Gallery should be Robbins' "break out" book and help get him the large audience he deserves.

Once again, Patterson creates an interesting plot (although not nearly as exciting, surprising and original as many of his earlier Alex Cross books) -- but, also once again, he has become too willing to settle for mediocrity in his writing style. At best, his characters are superficially developed and the dialogue he has his characters speak is barely serviceable and credible. Further, he has gone way overboard in Big Bad Wolf in regards to the writing gimmicks for which he has become known. If you feel you MUST read the latest Patterson, be willing to forego most of the qualities you would normally look for in a good book -- and a good writer. Expect nothing more than a book that will provide light entertainment. Personally, I'm annoyed at myself for buying Big Bad Wolf, as it is just the latest exmple of Patterson knowing that his fans will plunk down their hard earned money regardless of his being increasingly less willing to provide them with the quality he made sure he provided when he was building his reputation. Big Bad Wolf is likely to be the last book from which Patterson will receive any of my money. While I'm not keeping my fingers crossed, it would be nice to see Patterson return to showing interest in having &quot;quality&quot; associated with his works rather than &quot;quantity.&quot; His &quot;paint by numbers&quot; formulaic writing approach has enabled him to spew out 3 or 4 books a year, and thus become an industry unto himself, so to speak. It's probably naive of me to expect him to sacrifice some of the &quot;green&quot; he is raking in in his &quot;quantity vs. quantity&quot; approach to writing -- but I can only hope. As I said, however, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.

Above The Law is worth reading -- interesting plot, strong characters and fast-paced. However, unlike most of J.F. Freedman's legal thrillers, his latest effort provides few real surprises, as most of the attempted plot &quot;twists&quot; are apparent and predictable well in advance of when the author reveals them in the story. As other reviewers noted, one of the most exciting parts of the book is its opening sequence, although it has little relationship to the &quot;real&quot; story being told. Above The Law is a book that deserves to be read, but you might want to consider taking it from the library instead of buying it.

While it's probably not a surprise that Ludlum didn't write this book (at least not in its entirety), The Janson Directive is a fast-paced international thriller that -- in typical Ludlum fashion --will keep you turning the pages until the wee hours of the morning. It's very fast-paced and loaded with action and suspense. Further, based on writing style and characterization, &quot;this&quot; Ludlum often surpasses the &quot;real&quot; Ludlum. The Janson Directive is a big book (547 pages) and lots of fun to read (although I think it might have been even better if it been 50-100 pages shorter,which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating). Hopefully, there will be more books by &quot;this&quot; Ludlum. I think you'll find that once you start The Janson Directive you'll agree that your in for an exciting reading experience that will allow you to escape far from reality. Enjoy!

City Of Bones represents another riveting, hard-edged, unforgettable thriller in the continuing series featuring Harry Bosch. In typical Connelly fashion, he's created an intelligent, attention-grabbing plot -- this one involving the finding of evidence of a murder committed over twenty years earlier. Also, as fans of Connelly have come to expect, City Of Bones is filled with well-developed characters, "real world" dialogue, and lots of surprises. While it can be argued if this is the best in the series or not, it is unquestionably well-worth reading and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series to see what the future holds for Harry Bosch. Get a copy of City Of Bones and prepare yourself for a highly entertaining mystery.

I put off reading The King Of Torts for a long time due to the many average-to-below average reader reviews posted on Amazon. I'm glad, however, that I finally decided to read it, as it is the best book Grisham has written in a long time. The King Of Torts is about morality (or lack thereof) and greed. Without going into detail, the plot involves a lawyer who decides to give up his job as a lawyer in the Office of the Public Defender after being given the chance to handle a major mass tort case against a pharmaceutical company. He goes on to become the King Of Torts, as well as fabulously wealthy and extremely greedy in a very short time. A lot of information is learned about tort lawyers and their relentless pursuit of major corporations at the slightest whiff of impropriety. Grisham's hero, Clay Carter, can also be considered the villain in this very interesting and exciting thriller. I think what led to many of the negative reviews of Grisham's latest book is not that it is boring or poorly written or unexciting, but more to the contempt he creates about the main character due to the extent of his of greed and immorality. As such, unlike in most thrillers, the reader doesn't have a &quot;good guy&quot; to route for. Further, deep down I think many of the readers crticize the book because of the very good job Grisham does in getting the reader to route for the villain. The King Of Torts is the best book I've read by Grisham in years and, having been steadily dissapointed in many of his more recent, am once again a &quot;big fan&quot; and anxiously awaiting his new book due out in a few weeks, called The Last Juror.

After having recently finished Roughan's second book, The Promise Of A Lie, which was very good, I went back to read his debut thriller, The Up And Comer. I enjoyed this book a great deal as well. Roughan is at the very least an "Up and Comer" in the thriller genre, and I'd say he's definitely arrived. He's joined the group of writers that I consider to be "must reads." The Up And Comer has it all -- a captivating plot, thrills, suspense, humor, strong characters, sex, clever dialogue, etc.Without giving away the plot, the story involves a lawyer who decides to take the law into his own hands to try to prevent being exposed for an affair that will threaten the existence of his near perfect lifestyle. Despite his limited sense of morality, Roughan's main character, Philip Randall, is one you can't help liking (and rooting for) even though he stands for many things most people would say they dislike in a person. I highly recommend The Up And Comer as an excellent beach read. It's the type of book that once you start reading, you won't want to stop until you finish it. Do yourself a favor and read this book, as well as Roughan's latest, The Promise Of A Lie. If you're like me, Roughan will soon become one of your "must read" authors.

Rosenfelt succesfully follows up his debut novel, Open And Shut, with First Degree. Rosenfelt is becoming one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers due to his ability to provide interesting plots, credible courtroom drama, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters. Andy Carpenter, the main character who is a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney, is one that stays in your mind even after you finish the book and is one that I'm looking forward to 'hang out' with in his future legal adventures. Plus, his dog, Tara, is one I wish I had. The only factor that keeps me from giving First Degree a 5-star rating is that Rosenfelt spent a bit too much time on humor to serve as "filler" to stretch out the length of this book (which is only 256 pages). Despite this very minor criticism I highly recommend First Degree when you're in the mood for a fast-paced, easy read. However, you might want to first consider reading Open And Shut, which I think will further your appreciation of First Degree.

It's no wonder that Plainsong was a National Book Award finalist! Haruf has written a very heartwarming story set in a small town in the High Prairies east of Denver in which seven members of the community -- spanning four generations -- come together in the face of great difficulties to form an extended family that we all wish we could have if necessary. While the story is a very simple one, Haruf tells it with great humanity, intensity and emotion. Further, his dialogue and narrative skills are so real you think you are right there experiencing first hand life in Holt, Colorado as the story unfolds. Do yourself a favor and put Plainsong at or near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list.

The Pledge is a fast-paced and exciting debut by Ron Kean that will most likely find wide appeal among both younger and older readers. It will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end. So why a &quot;3&quot; rating and not higher? Basically because the plot and characters, while interesting, tended to stretch my willingness to extend credibility beyond the breaking point in too many instances. While I understand this is a work of fiction and some implausability is 'allowed&quot; in order to maintain suspense, The Pledge, for me, went too far too often to rate it more than three stars. Nonetheless, The Pledge is worth reading and I'm looking forward to Kean's next book.

If you've read any of Avery Corman's books, you know of his strong ability to make you feel that you are right there with his characters feeling their every emotion. Well, Corman once again demonstrates this special skill in A Perfect Divorce, in which he masterfully tells a story of well-intentioned parents of a teenage son attempt to lessen the impact of their failed two-career marriage with an intelligent, successful divorce. It is a very special tale of life, love, child-rearing and divorce. At times it will make you smile with joy, feel like crying (if not actually cry) out of happiness and sadness, and, at times, break your heart due to the disappointment the divorced parents experience as well as the pain felt by the divorced child. Corman is an excellent writer and one you should not miss. All of his books are well worth reading -- the best of which are Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Old Neighborhood, 50, and Prized Possessions. Do yourself a real favor and get a copy of A Perfect Divorce. I'm confident you'll be very glad you did.

Michael Connelly's newest book, A Darkness More Than Night, features Terry McCaleb and Jaye Winston (from Blood Work)and Harry Bosch in a thriller that will definitely keep you glued to your seat. Be prepared for the pages to seem that they they are flying through your fingers. If you liked Blood Work, you'll greatly enjoy seeing how McCaleb tries to once again see inside a horrifyingly deranged criminal mind. What he uncovers, however, will not seem possible. In typical Connelly fashion, he develops characters, both good and bad, that are very well-developed and ones you'll feel are very real. Further, his plot will keep you engrossed from first page to last. Don't hesitate to add A Darkness More Than Night to your must-read list.

Luckiest Man by Jonathan Eig provides an engrossing, encompassing portrait of Lou Gehrig -- a complex man who despite his many insecurities became one of baseball's and America's finest heroes. Eig presents it all, ranging from Gehrig's growing up with a very domineering mother, to his humbleness and constant self-doubt despite his many outstanding achievements, to his relationships with his teammates and especially Babe Ruth, to his desire to let his actions rather than his mouth promote his abilities, to his relationship with women and his wife, and finally to his courage in battling the disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), that he contracted at the zenith of his careed and that ultimately took his life at the young age of thirty-six. Eig's skill as a writer is demonstrated by his ability to make you want to stay glued to your seat while absorbing a wealth of information about this fascinating man. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Luckiest Man -- just a person who enjoys learning about a man who deservedly has become an American icon.

The Five People You Meet In Heaven is one of those rare reading treasures -- a book that will stay in your memory and heart forever. Regardless of your religion, view about heaven, the meaning of life and your role in it, The Five People You Meet In Heaven will grab your attention and not let go until the last word. And, in so doing, this book will help change much, if not all, of whatever you've thought about heaven and the meaning of life on earth. Albom's narrative skills and his ability to create succinct, yet impactful dialogue for his characters demonstate a talent that is light years ahead of most other authors. The Five Years You Meet In Heaven is destined to become a classic -- and this honor will be well-deserved. I highly recommend it!

Having struggled through about half of Retreat, Hell, I surrendered to the boring plot, weak character development and lack of action and gave up reading it. The jacket cover made me feel that I was going to be in for a real treat. However, I was misled and can sum my feelings up about this book in one acronym...NATO... no action, talk only. Rather than providing a good mix of action and military history, Retreat, Hell is so filled with minutiae that it overwhelms any of the very few and far between parts that are (at best) moderately exciting. Do yourself a favor and sjip this book.

At the center of Mama Flora's Family is the indomitable spirit of Mama Flora, the matriarch of an extraordinary family of destitute Tennessee sharecroppers. The characters are so real and believable it made this reader feel that I was right there with them experiencing all their trials and tribulations, as well as the joys. This book is much more than a poignant, hard-to-put-down story of a Mama Flora and her descendants from 1920 to the late 1990s. It, for the most part, effectively weaves into the plot much of what has transpired in American/African-American history during this time period (e.g., life for African-Americans in the South, the rise of the Civil Rights movement, the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, the Viet Nam war, political repression under Idi Amin, etc). Mama Flora's Family is a rich, resonant family novel that cuts across the barriers that divide us to touch the hearts of people of all races and backgrounds. I highly recommend this excellent, emotionally-packed posthumous novel written by David Stevens based on Alex Haley's notes and research.

The Lincoln Lawyer will keep you glued to your seat and your fingers turning the pages at a very fast pace from the opening chapter to the last. The Lincoln Lawyer, a legal thriller featuring Mickey Haller, represents a departure from Connelley's police procedural series featuring Harry Bosch. It is every bit as good as the best of the Bosch series. Haller and the other characters are very interesting, well-developed and captivating. The pace is fast and the plot is filled with surprising twists and turns. At times, I forgot I was reading a book by Michael Connelly and not one of John Grisham's better books. In Mickey Haller, Connelly has created a character that, while perhaps not the most honorable member of the bar, is the type of criminal defense lawyer everyone would probably want representing them if the need arose. Haller has the potential to be at least as memorable a character as Harry Bosch and one that I hope to read more about in the future. Be forewarned -- once you sit down to read The Lincoln Lawyer, you won't be getting up for quite awhile!

One thing that can always be counted on is that Daniel Silva's thrillers will not only be exciting, they will be very intelligent, well-written, well-researched and compelling. A Death In Vienna completes the Holocaust trilogy that started with The English Assassin and was followed by The Confessor, and it is every bit as good as its predecessors. Each of these books are novels of slow-building, yet non-stop tension and suspense that will keep you glued the edge of your seat. If you haven't read a Daniel Silva book before, do yourself a favor and add this book -- and all of his books -- to your Must Read list. Money and/or time spent on a Silva book is as good as gold. You will be more than satisfied. While the subject matter of A Death In Vienna is filled with the inhumanity that occurred during the Holocaust and with contempt for those who enabled this tragedy to occur, Silva describes these events with tremendous feeling. Silva has become not only a master thriller writer, he has become one of the better writers of contemporary fiction.

With The Inside Ring, Michael Lawson has quickly established himself as an author to be reckoned with. This book is heavily plot-driven and involves a bold assassination attempt on the President of the U.S. and the private investigation into the incident. This book is filled with action and suspense and will keep you glued to your seat, especially during the last 100 pages or so. The main character, Joe DeMarco, is a lawyer on the staff of the Speaker of the House who is put in charge of the investigation. DeMarco is a likable and interesting character despite a sordid family past and will, undoubtedly, be featured in future books by Lawson. The other characters are not particularly well-developed but are still interesting. The fast pace of this book, however, will likely allow you to (mostly) overlook this shortcoming. While not everything that happens 'rings true', Lawson writing style is very entertaining and easy to follow. The Inside Ring is highly recommended for your next beach-read or plane trip.

Louis L'Amour's Kid Rodelo is one of the most amateurish, poorly written books I've ever read. It fails BIG TIME on every level -- weak plot, no character development, child-like dialogue and - oh, yeah-- it is totally predictable. It's been a long time since I've read a book by Louis L'Amour and the next time I'll be reading a book by him will be when hell freezes over! Please -- do not be swayed by the two reviewers that gave Kid Rodelo a 5-star rating. Do yourself a favor and avoid reading this book at all costs. I'm now going to take my copy and put it in the section of my house where I put books of this poor quality -- i.e., the trash.If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned western, I'd recommend that you try Appaloosa and Gunman's Rhapsody by Robert B.

Tell No One, Coben's first book outside his Myron Bolitar series, is one you won't want to miss. If possible, I would rate it '4 1/2' stars. In typical Coben fashion, his newest book moves along at the pace of a runaway train. Once you start Tell No One, its twist-filled plot, interesting characters, and subtely humorous, yet realistic dialogue will make you forget everything else around you. If you're a fan of the Bolitar series, you'll be more than pleased by having to wait for the series to continue. If this is your first Coben book, I think you'll agree that after reading Tell No One, you'll be adding Coben to your list of 'must read' authors.

This relatively lightweight lens with a built-in optical stabilizer is top-notch in delivering high quality images with little-to-no distortion throughout its 18-200mm (really 28-320mm for my Canon EOS Rebel T1i DSLR)) focal lenths when taking outdoor shots. Indoors, images are also sharp but autofocusing is somewhat slow in low light conditions. However, this limitation can be mostly overcome by setting the camera to manual and auto focus. I'd highly recommend this versatile, leightweight lens when you are looking to use just one lens for most of your photo needs.

If you've read any of Patterson's books, you'll know that his books are not great literature and his characters are not particularly well-developed -- BUT they are very fast-paced, suspenseful, thrilling and filled with surprises. Violets Are Blue is no exception. It is pure escape reading, and if you're in the mood to escape, I think this book will more than satisfy this mood. Enjoy! I'm looking to forward reading Patterson's latest, Four Blind Mice.

Samaritan is another very well wriiten story of urban life, but not up to par with Freedomland and, particularly, Clockers. Price's ability in developing characters that stay with you long after you finish his books and his strength in writing dialogue that is very true-to-life is of a caliber that is unequaled by most popular fiction writers writing today. He has developed stories of his main and minor characters that are very interesting, all of which are intertwined with that of his protagonist, Ray Mitchell. What is lacking for me in Samaritan, and which keeps me from giving it a higher rating, is the development of a very interesting plot. What kept me reading this book was the high quality of Price's writing (5 stars), not the plot itself (3 stars). For me, Clockers and Freedomland, deserved 5 stars on both important factors. Nonetheless, Samaritan is a book worth your time and money. Enjoy!

McCammon once again delivers a fast-paced, attention-holding plot with well-developed characters. The basic plot involves two young men -- one who one who talks to the dead, the other who heals the living. In years to come they are haunted by the same dream, they grapple with restless spirits, and they become deadly rivals on this earthly plane -- and beyond. The first half of the book and the last chapter or two were 'unputdownable." I found myself glued to my seat anxious to see what was to happen next. However, the second half dragged on too much during several passages. Overall, this book would have been better if it was 50-75 pages shorter. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of horror stories, Mystery Walk is a book I think you will enjoy

Death of A Stranger is the first book I've read by Anne Perry. It involves the death of a railway magnate in a sleazy brothel, which has shocked high society in Victorian London. In addition, the plot involves private investigator William Monk's acquisiton of a mysterious new client who asks him to determine whether her new fiance, a railway-firm executive, has become involved in fraudulent practices. Perry does a good job in describing the detail and mood of Victorian London and in creating interesting characters; particularly in regards to evolving her two main characters, William Monk and his wife, Heather. If mood and character development are what drive your interest in a mystery than Death Of A Stranger is right up your alley. However, while these qualities are important to me as well, I require a much faster-paced plot and some surprising twists and turns, which, unfortunately this book seriously lacks. As such, I at times found it to be tedious and somewhat boring, and oftentimes considered it to be very slow-moving. Death Of A Stranger is not a bad book, it's just not one I'd recommend highly to you.

In Fade, Mills delivers a thriller that holds your attention from first page to last. His main characters are well-developed and not the run-of-the mill action figures, particularly Salem al-Fayed. What keeps this book from getting a 5-star rating is that while the plot is filled with action, much of it is predictable. Further, several of the secondary characters are one-dimensional and stereotpical. While Fade didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it based on its very exciting first half of the book, it is still worth reading and a notch above many of the other recent books in this genre.

The Innocent Man demonstrates the extensive research Grisham did in preparing his book about small-town justice gone awry. It also demonstrates Grisham's heavily biased point of view on capital punishment. There is no question that a horrible injustice was done to the main character and the devastating impact it had on his life; however, Grisham's telling of this story is too slow-moving and oftentimes repetitive in making a point (especially when it supports his viewpoint on capital punishment). For me, it read more like a well-researched report on the subject than a good true crime book; e.g., strong character development, some excitement and suspense regarding the investigation of the crime and subsequent trial, etc. As a result, I found The Innocent Man to be somewhat tedious and boring. Perhaps, it would have been more interesting if the main character was a person I really cared about. Prior to his being arrested and convicted of a crime he didn't commit, Ron Williamson at an early age was on the road to letting life defeat him. He could never grow up and get on with his life after being disappointed that he wasn't going to fulfill his dream of being a major league baseball player; and thus lived a life consumed with alcohol, drugs and carousing. Basically, he was a "sorry figure." Obviously, however, Williamson didn't deserve the tragedy that he ultimately had to deal with. It is the subject matter of the book that is important; although, as mentioned, The Innocent Man is too slow-moving and repetitive in telling the story.

If you're looking for an exciting, interesting and informative thriller that will take you back in time to the years preceding the U.S.'s entering WWII, I very much recommend The Second Assassin to you. The story is based on the planned assassination of the King and Queen of England in 1939 during their trip to the U.S. The plan was to destroy any hope of an alliance between Great Britain and the U.S., thus ensuring victory for the Nazis in WWII.Hyde is meticulous in his research and is terrific in describing this period with accuracy, charm and lots of color. Further, Hyde's suspenseful thriller is loaded with real-life characters, about which he provides interesting and many little-known facts (at least to me) that enables this book to rise above the average historical thriller. Of particular interest to me (and I think will be to you, too) were the "factoids" Hyde provides about Lyndon Johnson, Allen Dulles, John Cardinal Spellman, Joseph Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt, Vice President Garner, Postmaster Farley, Frank Sinatra -- and, of course, the King and Queen of England. Regardless of the accuracy of the historical details described , The Second Assassin is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to read on and on. My only reason for giving this book 4 1/2 stars and not a 5-star rating is that a few of the clues and planned next steps of the "bad guys" just seem to fall into the "good guys/girl's" hands just a little too easily. Putting this minor detail aside, as well as the difference between a 4 1/2 and 5 star rating, The Second Assassin by Christopher Hyde is well worth reading and one that should be near the top of your to-be-read list.If you can find a copy, you might also enjoy A Gathering Of Saints, by Christopher Hyde. This book, published in 1996, like The Second Assassin, is a work of fiction based on historical fact during WWII.Enjoy!

I've been a big fan of Coben's books since the Myron Bolitar series. His latest, Just One Look, is a book you won't be able to put down and will keep you in suspense from the very beginning to the very end. It is well worth reading. With that said, Just One Look, on a comparative basis, ranks a notch below two of his other stand-alones -- Tell No One and Gone For Good. While the main character, Grace, is well-developed, the more secondary characters -- and there are so many of them you need a scorecard to keep track of them -- are not particularly well-developed. Further, I had some credibility issues with some of them. The basic plot is a simple and interesting one -- a suburban housewife picks up some photos from the store, one of which is an old print depicting her husband with other people from his college days. When the wife shows the photo to her husband, he leaves home and disappears. When the wife soon learns that her husband has been kidnapped, she goes off to search for him. While this plot is suspenseful, it is not especially original, as Coben has used some of his plot devices in his other stand-alones. For example, the concept in Coben's three previous books is one in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can easily relate to, and the use of a kidnapped family member was a key factor in Coben's last book, No Second Chance. So, I'm starting to miss some of the originality that I'd come to expect from Coben. Perhaps, he needs to take a step back and have his next book or two feature the main character, Myron Bolitor, from his excellent mystery series. As mentioned above, Just One Look has many characters that at times makes it difficult to remember who's who. However, Coben does neatly tie all the loose strings together involving these characters and who did what to who at the end. Please understand that my criticisms are not MAJOR ones and should NOT deter you from reading this book, especially if this is your first book by Coben. Coben remains one of my favorite authors and I think he'll be one of yours as well.

The basic concept of Lupica's latest is a strong, i.e., hazing and murder in a small town. However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them. Given the blurbs from two authors I like a lot (Harlan Coben and Robert Parker), I had high expectations for Too Far and had moved it to the top of my "to-be-read" list. As you can see, though, from my comments above, my disappoint in this book is obvious and I will not be rushing out any time soon to read another book by Lupica. Do yourself a favor and skip this book.

Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new &quot;voice&quot; in popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a &quot;5&quot; is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise. However, the actual rating level here is not really that relevant. What is relevant is that this is a book you'll be glad to read.

The Last Jihad is a very timely political post-9/11 thriller that will have the pages fly through you fingers. The excitement, suspense and tension builds right from the start and never lets up until the very end. While the characters are not particularly well-developed, the plot more than makes up for this weakness. While not every one is going to agree with the decisions made towards Iraq in this book, I am sure you'll feel that reading The Last Jihad will be like being on a roller-coaster ride that seems out of control. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!

Mark Gimenez's first legal thriller is very fast-paced and highly entertaining. With the exception of the two nine-year old girls (who are too "cutesy" and knowledgeable to be very credible), most of the characters are pretty well-developed and believable. The plot is interesting and exciting, and Giminez's cynical description of what being a top corporate lawyer is like seems very accurate. The Color Of Law, although ultimately mostly predictable, will keep the pages flying through your fingers. If you are into legal thrillers, I think The Color Of Law is a book you will enjoy.

For the fourth consecutive novel, Coben relies on his proven formula in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can relate to. This formula is one that, for the most part, works big time. The plot devices used in The Innocent, while similar to those in each of his books since Tell No One, are suspenseful, full of twists and turns and will keep the pages flying through your finger tips. The characters are interesting and well-developed, although they require you to suspend belief perhaps a bit too much. Another minor criticism - and I stress MINOR--is that as a result of The Innocent following the same basic formula of Coben's previous three books, it lacks some of the originality I earlier had come to expect from this very talented author. Nonetheless, The Innocent is well-worth reading, very engrossing and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page. Fasten your seat belts!

In Sinatra: The Life, Summers and Swan have written an in-depth, comprehensive chronicle of the iconic celebrity; and in doing so enables the reader to obtain an understanding of Sinatra that goes far behind his long, successful career as a world-renowned singer and actor. In this book, the reader not only gets to learn about all of Sinatra's 'beauty marks' throughout his illustrious career, but about all of his 'warts' as well -- and there were many of them. It is these "warts' that show that Sinatra had a dark side that goes against the grain of what many of Sinatra's long-time fans who wrote reviews of this book want to believe is true -- and, hence, contributes to the many 1 and 2 star ratings given to Sinatra:The Life.Readers will get to see the side of Sinatra that is well-known to many of his fans; i.e., a man who was extremly loyal and generous to those he viewed as his friends (as long as he didn't feel they crossed him in the slightest way). In addition, they get to see the darker side of Sinatra, a side the authors pull no punches in enabling readers to learn about Sinatra's highly volatile (and often times violent) behavior, his self-serving nature, his sexual promiscuity, his being besot with insecurities, his suicide attempts, his political forays and, of course, his virtually career-long association with the Mob.Needless to say, Sinatra was a very complex man and Summers and Swan wrote a very informative and interesting book that provides a well-balanced portrait of his life. I enjoyed Sinatra: The Life very much and recommend highly to anyone who wants to get to know the man in a way that they might not have known him before.

Philip Roth has long been one of our leading literary authors and, while The Plot Against America may not be his best work, it is certainly, very well-written, thought-provoking and holds your interest from beginning to end. The basic plot involves a Jewish family's concerns about life in America if, and subsequently when, Charles Lindbergh, is elected president. Roth's character development and narrative skills makes you feel that you are right there living with this family and sharing the fears and turmoil that they are experiencing. The Plot Against America is well worth reading from a literary standpoint as well as from an alternative history perspective. The only factor that keeps me from giving this book a 5-star rating is the ending, which, while satisfacory, I felt was a bit rushed and a bit abrupt.

I have read every book by James Patterson has written and felt that they were all readable. I consider his Alex Cross books to be excellent. His latest, however,When The Wind Blows, is not only HIS worst book, it is one of the worst books I've read in many years. This book has no redeeming qualities--the writing style is amateurish, the characters are plastic and, worst of all, the dialogue is awful. Do yourself a favor and read ANYTHING else but When The Wind Blows.

With King's (supposedly) last stand alone book he has accomplished what medical science has been unable to do...he's developed a sure-fire cure for Insomnia. I couldn't understand why whenever I'd pick up this book, I'd fall asleep after reading only a few pages. I wasn't tired when I started reading. Then I realized that it was because From A Buick 8 is mostly very BORING. I'd define the plot as &quot;too little too late.&quot; The supposedly scary &quot;stuff&quot; isn't scary. And the characters are not very credible, not well-developed and -- oh yeah -- not very interesting. I've given this book a 2-star rating as a &quot;going away&quot; present to King. During the first half of his writing career, King was my favorite author and I anxiously awaited his next book. It didn't matter what the book was about, just the fact that &quot;the King&quot; wrote it was enough for me to plunk down my money. However, while I've continued to buy most of King's books in more recent years, I've been continually disappointed -- and From A Buick 8 is no exception. It's not really a BAD book; it's just not worth your time and certainly not worth your money. If this book reflects the best of King's creative juices, it's probably best that he made the decision to put down his pen.

The Alternate is a legal thriller that is fast-paced and will hold your interest. However, I felt the earlier reviews tend to overrate the book. I found that while the plot had many twists, most were predictable. Further, the relationships between the key characters were also able to be predicted well in advance. Nonetheless, Martel tells a story that will make you want to read on and has developed characters that you will care about. Actually, while I rated The Alternate a '3', it really deserves a '3 1/2'.

For all but the last 50-75 pages of this 673 page book, The Lion's Game presented a very interesting plot, multi-dimensional characters including a memorable terrorist with whom you could have sympathy despite his despicable acts, humor and lots of excitement. I was feeling that this is the rare sequel that is better than the original. BUT... then came the ending! Or rather the lack of one that provided any sense of closure or satisfaction. It seems that Mr. DemIlle just ran out of steam and decided that rather than provide a &quot;real&quot; ending, he'll write yet another sequel. While The Lion's Game is a book that is enjoyable, it could have been so much better.

Term Limits is a good first effort from Vince Flynn and I plan to read his other novels. The book is filled with action, which makes you turn the pages at an increasingly fast rate. For me, however, the plot, while interesting, went somewhat over the limit to which I am willing to extend belief. Further, none of the characters -- both the supposedly &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; -- are ones you care much about and it's often hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. As a result, I thought Term Limits is worthy of reading but only deserving of a &quot;good/3 star&quot; rating.

Saul does a good job in bringing to life the small New England town of Blackstone, and of the secrets and sins that lay buried there. For almost two-thirds of the book I was engrossed in the horrors that were taking place and was involved in trying to figure out who was responsible for what was going on. However, my interest in the surviving characters, which were at best superficially developed, started to rapidly wain during the last third of The Blackstone Chronicles; and the finale left me disappointed as I was able to figure out much of the ending earlier on. All in all, reading The Blackstone Chronicles for me was like chewing a piece of bubble gum. It's mildly enjoyable while going through the process but very forgettable soon after finishing it.

I first read The Godfather in 1969, when it came out in hardcover, and I knew at that time that a classic was born. Today, I gave myself a 60th birthday present and finished my second reading of this book. After over 36 years, The Godfather remains a masterpiece of not only great crime fiction, but of modern literature. The Godfather introduced millions of readers (and later, moviegoers) to the first family of American crime, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed and the allegiance to family are the themes that resonate throughout this excellent book, and continue to make The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that will remain etched in my consciousness forever. If you've never read the book, perhaps because you've seen the movie -- fuhgetaboutit! Do yourself a favor and read Mario Puzo's The Godfather. It is truly an American classic!

I've been a big fan of Richard North Patterson's books over the years. Some of his books are among my all-time favorites. However, Protect And Defend is a a far cry from being among his best. As a matter of fact, this book falls near the bottom of the pack. Instead of being focused on creating an interesting and compelling story line with well-developed characters, for which Patterson had previously been noted, Protect And Defend is much too focused an expounding (ad nauseum, at times) on the issue of abortion, and does so at the expense of a rich plot. Too often I found myself skimming through the pages in order to search for the "story." Unfortunately, this task became too tedious and unrewarding, and I had to give up on the book about about two-thirds of the way through. Unless you have a burning desire to read a treatise on the pro-life/pro-choice issue, I'd suggest that you skip this book.

Five Families provides a fact-filled chronicle of the Mafia from prior to its becoming organized in the U.S. to the present. It is not a story that wraps itself around a few main characters, as perhaps some dissatisfied reviewers were expecting. Rather Five Families chronicles the Mafia from its inception to its "heyday" through its decline and supposedly to its resurgence(although Raab spends almost no time presenting this evidence). Overall, I enjoyed Five Families for the facts it presents and was surprised by all the very negative reviews it received on Amazon. True, it is not a fast read. Nor is it much more than a chronicle of the Mafia's influence and of its members. Having read many books over the years about organized crime in the U.S, a lot of what was presented was a review of what I had read previously; but much was also new information. I was not diappointed by this and it was basically what I expected. I'm not quite sure if my 4-star rating is inflated due to my considering it to be more deserving than the many 1-star ratings it received or if I would have still given it this rating if I hadn't read any of the earlier reviews. Regardless, if you're in the mood for a book that is loaded with facts and insights into the Mafia, Five Families is a book I think you'l enjoy.

After reading many of the very negative reader reviews posted here, I was pleasantly surprised to find The Summons to be very enjoyable. While I wouldn't consider The Summons to be a thriller in the style I've become used to in a Grisham book, the tension Grisham creates is ever-present. The characters, while flawed and not very likable, are credible, the plot is interesting and the pace is fast. I found myself steadily engrossed in the story and liked the somewhat surprising ending; though it is open-ended (and maybe too much so for many of those who gave this book a poor rating).The plot Grisham presents is a simple and believable one. Without going into any detail, two brothers are summoned home by their dying father. Upon the return of one of the brothers, he finds his father dead as well as lots of boxes filled with a substantial amount of money. The plot thickens (so to speak) when he decides to keep the money and not tell anyone. As I said, The Summons is not one of Grisham's best books but it is one that's worth reading and very entertaining.

Repairman Jack continues to be one of the more original and interesting characters in contemporary fiction. In Crisscross, Jack criscrosses two seemingly separate fix-it cases in an attmept to settle the deadliest of scores. In typical fashion with cases Repairman Jack is involved in, they involve both the natural and supernatural, the action is continuous, and the body count is high and often brutal. If you're in the mood for pure escapist reading during your next trip to the beach or plane trip, Crisscross, as well as most of the other books in F. Paul Wilson's exciting Repairman Jack series, will keep you totally involved and make you forget everything else that is going on around you. Enjoy!

Richard Ben Cramer has written a very interesting and well-written biography about Joe DiMaggio that is hard to put down. Be warned, however, that much of what is written about DiMaggio will make you realize that he may not have been as deserving of the pedestal on which the American public allowed him to live his life. Rather, Cramer makes DiMaggio less of an icon and more like what the rest of us are -- mere mortals and very human. Cramer certainly gives DiMaggio his due as an outstanding baseball player and worthy of the legendary status he still holds. However, he does not mince words in describing DiMaggio's frailties as a husband and father as well as his self-centeredness and, oftentimes, selfishness as a friend and business associate. While DiMaggio has been loved and worshiped by millions of people for his heroic baseball accomplishments, he appears to have lived much of his private life -- particularly his post-baseball life -- as a lonely and unhappy man.Richard Ben Cramer's &quot;Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life&quot; is much more than a biography about a baseball player. It is a book that transcends the game and it's players and very clearly makes evident that the public image created by the media about our heroes may not be true representations of what these people are really like. Much controversy has surrounded this book in terms of the honesty in which Cramer portrays various episodes about DiMaggio's life. Regardless of how much of what is written is true, this is a book that is well worth reading and one I'd highly recommend.

Ex-cop John Mackie's first novel is worth reading and warrants a 3 1/2 star rating. Manhattan South is a fast read, has an interesting story and pretty well-developed characters (for the most part). While the plot moves along at a brisk pace, I didn't think this book deserved more than 3 1/2 stars since there really weren't any surprises and most of the occurences were predictable. Also, Mackie leaves too many loose ends regarding some of the relationships between some of the characters. Perhaps, however, the author did this intentionally in order to create interest in a sequel or a series involving these characters. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, Manhattan South makes a good beach read or when you're in the mood for a "light ", action-packed police yarn.

I enjoyed Joel Rosenberg's two previous thrillers very much but had some reservations about reading The Ezekiel Option. My hesitancy stemmed from a concern about Rosenberg being too heavy-handed in presenting his Christian-oriented view of the world and about being preached to. For the most part, my concerns were unwarranted, as the end-times prophecies in the Bible, Ezekiel 38-39, were an integral part of the plot. I did, however, at times feel a bit put upon when Rosenberg had his characters in various scenarios involved in (too) heavy duty prayer sessions. Aside from this minor criticism, The Ezekiel Option is a page-turner from beginning to end and will keep you glued to your seat. The suspense is non-stop and the characters are well-developed and believable. It's clear that Rosenberg's next book, The Copper Scroll, due out in late Summer, will pick up where The Ezekiel Option left off. Despite your religion and your personal viewpoints towards religion, if you are a thriller-lover, The Ezekiel Option is a book I think you'll enjoy very much.

Once it is known that 'The new Lehane' is in bookstores should be enough to make booklovers rush out to buy a copy. Their money will be well spent, as The Given Day is a work of art. It is much more than just an excellent book, it is fine literature. The Given Day, which takes place primarily in Boston just after WWI, is an epic story of family greed, love, power, hardship, lust, hope and politics. It tells the story of two families -- one white, one black -- swept up in the maelstrom of revolutionaries, anarchists, immigrants, ward bosses, Brahmnins, the Boston police department and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power. As interesting and powerful as the plot is, Lehane's strongest accomplishment is the cast of unforgettable, true-to-life characters he has created. You'll meet beat-cop Danny Coughlin, Boston Police Department royalty and the son of one of the city's most beloved and powerful police captains. Luther Laurence, a black man on the run after a deadly confrontation with a crime boss who works for the Coughlin family. Nora, the Irish immigrant who was taken in by the Coughlins and is the love of Danny's life, as well as many other very credible multidimensional characters. Lehane does such an excellent job in describing these characters that I felt I was right there alongside them feeling all of their joys and sorrows. In addition, Lehane expertly weaves into the story many real-life influential people of the era -- including Babe Ruth, Eugene O'Neill, leftist Jack Reed, NAACP founder W.E.B. Du Bois, Mitchell Palmer, Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge and an ambitious young justice department lawyer named John Hoover. The Given Day is over 700 pages of reading pleasure and a book that I most highly recommend to you. It is a masterpiece of historical fiction!

The Devil Knows You're Dead is a very well written book that held my interest throughout -- however, I have been a big fan of this series from the beginning. Mystery fans who are looking for lots of action and suspense may want to skip this book. Relative to several of the other books in this series, there is considerably less physical violence and more --much more-- of a concentration on the emotional havoc and angst that Matthew Scudder is experiencing as he makes his way through his topsy-turvy world. The cases Scudder is working on in The Devil Knows You're Dead are interesting but they are not exciting and action-based. So, if this is what you're looking for in a mystery you probably should choose another book. If you enjoy great character development, interesting and likable secondary characers, vivid and accurate descriptions of the Hell's Kitchen/Clinton section of NYC, then treat yourself to this very good book. Keep in mind it's not the best book in this series but it's one I think you'll enjoy. However, I would strongly recommend that if you haven't read any of the books in this series, you first read at least one or two of the earlier books (e.g., When The Scared Ginmill Closes, A Ticket To The Boneyard, A Dance At The Slaughterhouse, A Walk Among The Tombstones, etc.) before reading The Devil Knows You're Dead. These books will familiarize you what the world of Matthew Scudder has been like. This book serves pretty much as a vehicle to further evolve the main character of Matthew Scudder and to let you know where he's moving to in his life.

The House Of Special Purpose by Christopher Hyde is an entertaining historical thriller but it is not as good as some of this author's previous works (eg., Wisdom Of The Bones, The Second Assassin, A Gathering Of Saints, etc.). The plot involves the search by various international spies (Russia, Germany, England and the U.S.) for a film rumored to exist from the bloody days of the Bolshevik Revolution. This film could have a major impact on the balance of power in the war that is sure to involve the U.S. In typical Hyde fashion, his story is filled with real events, historical figures and true-to-life atmosphere that allowed this reader's interest to be held throughout the book. However, The House Of Special Purpose does not provide the level of sustained suspense that I found to exist in Hyde's other books. To me, Hyde made the book longer than it needed to be to be truly suspenseful in order for him to incorporate as many of the research findings as possible he uncovered about the people and events surrounding this period. It's not that these historical facts aren't interesting. They are, but at the same time they tended to detract from the excitement of the plot. As a consequence, while this book started off as if it would warrant a rating between 4-5 stars, by the time I finished it, I felt it did not deserve more than a 3 (possibly 3 1/2) star rating. Overall, The House Of Special Purpose is a good book and one that you'll probably enjoy if you like historical thrillers. It just does not live up to the high expectations I've come to expect from this author.

I've been a big fan of Richard Montanari, having read three of his books -- The Violet Hour, The Rosary Girls and The Skin Gods. While it pains me to say it, Kiss Of Evil was a painful reading experience. Although filled with murders and gore, I found the plot to be predictable and somewhat slow-moving. Further, Montanari didn't develop his characters well enough -- both the good and bad ones -- to make me care enough about what happened to any of them. The main challenge I associated with this book was to see if I had the determination to finish it rather than give up on it. And while I met this challenge, the real mystery was why I bothered. My recommendation to you is to read any of the excellent books by Montanari I mentioned above but definitely skip this one.

Norman Green is a very good writer and reminds me of Richard Price. In The Angel of Montague Street Greens tells the story of Silvana Iurata, who returns to Brooklyn after many years to find out what happened to his missing brother. He is well aware of the danger of his return, as his mob-connected cousin, who has held a grudge against Silvana from when they were teenagers, is planning to find and kill him. Green is a real pro in developing very "real", three-dimensional characters and in capturing the language and nuances of those from the seedier side of Brooklyn in the 1970's. If you enjoy books that are driven more by character development that plot, this is definitely a book I think you'll enjoy. If plot development and action-oriented thrillers, however, are your thing, then maybe you would be better off with a different book. While the plot is interesting and holds your attention, it moves at a pretty slow pace. So be prepared if you decide to take on this book. Having read and enjoyed The Angel of Montague Street, Green's second book, I bought his two other books.

After recently finishing Parker's Where Serpents Lie, which was excellent, I was looking forward to reading one of his earlier books. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed in The Triggerman's Dance I gave up on it less than half way through. The plot, which started off very interesting, was unable to sustain itself. Also, the characters were too contrived and lacked credibility.

Buffa has written a fast-moving, fairly entertaining story that generally holds your interest. The ending, however, is very predictable and one that you are likely to guess about 2/3s of the way through the book. Also, Buffa needs to improve his pacing in terms of providing for the passage of time. In several instances he allows years to go by without sufficient set-up for the reader. My suggestion is that if you have an interest in reading The Defense, get it from the library or borrow it from a friend; do not pay $20 for it!

The Ice Man grabs your attention from the opening chapter and rarely lets up. Carlo presents a lot of insight into Kuklinski's abused and unloved childhood which contributed heavily to his becoming a cold-blooded, ruthless killer. If you accept all of what is in the book at face value, Kuklinski became one of the Mafia's top contract killers (including involvement in the murders of Jimmy Hoffa, Paul Castellano, the man who accidentally ran over and killed John Gotti's son, etc.), as well as one of the leading distributors of porn in the U.S. Whether the scores of murders Kuklinski committed occurred just as Carlo describes them is of secondary importance to me; the reason being that the style in which he presents them is so captivating and "unputdownable." While at times, The Ice Man reads like a chronicalized laundry list of murder after murder, Carlo regularly weaves in new perspectives about Kuklinski and his motivations. Whether you are a fan of true crime books or not, I think you'll find The Ice Man to be a book that is not only very compelling while reading it, but also one that will stay in your memory for quite a long time.

The last 50 pages or so of Shutter Island were very surpising and made the book, overall, worth reading for me and one which I would recommend to you. Up until this point, however, I kept wavering between feeling that I liked the book a lot and that it was just fair. This is because the book kept jumping between sub-plots and time periods. For me, at various times I found the story a little too convoluted. Perhaps it was because I, at times, didn't pay enough attention to some of the subtle clues that Lehane was providing. As such, my advice to you is that once you start this book be prepared to pay careful attention to all the little details or the ending may not be as clear as you'd like it to be. Shutter Island is not a book to read when you want to read only a few pages before falling asleep. To appreciate this rather complex book, it's one that requires your full attention. I've read all of Dennis Lehane's books and consider him to be one of my top 2-3 favorite authors. Shutter Island is worth reading and recommended, but it is not as rich in suspense and character development as Lehane's previous bestseller, Mystic River. That's a book that I would recommend to you without ANY reservations.

Darkest Fear continues the long line of exciting mysteries from Harlan Coben. You can't want much more than Darkest Fear provides its readers -- great characters (featuring Myron Bolitar, Win, et al), strong dialogue (combining the right balance of humor and emotion), lots of action anf plenty of plot twists. You definitely won't want to stop reading this once you start! The only reason I didn't rate it a &quot;5&quot; is that it has SO MANY plot twists I, at times, felt I needed a score card to keep track of all the events that occur. This, though, really isn't a problem. Actually, I would have rated Darkest Fear &quot;4 1/2&quot; stars if I could have. Enjoy this book because it will be the last one in the series for a while.

Having read many of Parker's more recent books, I decided to read Pacific Beat, which was his third book written in 1991. This book clearly demonstrates that even early-on in his career Parker had a strong talent for creating intricate plots, rich characters, lots of atmosphere and believable, tough prose. Pacific Beat is a story of murder and corruption in Newport Beach, CA, and, in typical Parker fashion, has some interesting plot twists and a surprising ending. Two factors, however, kept me from giving this book a 5-star rating (and almost caused me to lower my rating to 3 1/2 stars). One, and the bigger of the two factors, is that it is a little too long and tended to drag at times. For me, this problem would have been overcome, if it was about 50 pages or so shorter. The second factor is that a few of the surprises seemed a bit too contrived. While not Parker's best book (which to me is Where Serpents Lie), Pacific Beat is worth reading.

Shaara's writing style, while not particularly fast-moving, allows the reader to obtain a vivid picture of what life was like during the years leading up to the our colonies' declaration of independence, and of the personal lives of the leading characters on both sides of the conflict. Shaara's depictions of leaders such as John and Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, General Gage, etc. makes you feel like you knew them personally and that you were right along side them while history was being made. If you are a lover of historical fiction or just someone interested in reading an interesting novel about events leading up to the birth of this country, I think Rise To Rebellion is a book that you'll enjoy very much. The only factor that kept me from giving this book a 5-star rating is that Shaara, at times, tended to dwell too much on some issues that (to me) weren't very interesting or important enough. However, this is a minor criticism and should not deter you from considering this enjoyable and well above-average work of historical fiction. I'm looking forward to reading Shaara's sequel to Rise To Rebellion, titled the Glorious Cause. Enjoy!

Grisham seemed to be more interested in writing a good treatise on the homeless than a good novel. While the story moves along at a fast pace, he barely attempts to go below the surface in developing the plot and characters. There are no surprises, but it does hold your interest.

I've been a big fan of all of William Diehl's books, and particularly Primal Fear. And, I thought Eureka was going to be right up there among his best after reading the first third or so of this noirish mystery. However, the remainder of the book's plot, while providing a lot of action, was somewhat predictable and unrealistic. Similarly, the main characters while likable, became too superhero-ish and the bad guys were "cartoonish" in terms of their development. So, all in all, although Eureka moves along at a fairly brisk pace and is not a bad book, it falls way short of fulfilling the high expectations I have for a book from William Diehl in general, and specifically because Eureka started out as a "real winner."

John Katzenbach has been one of my favorite authors -- his stories are always well-written and interesting from beginning to end. Hart's War and The Shadow Man and Just Cause are excellent examples of his work. In The Analyst, Katzenbach has come up with a premise equal to his best works. The basic idea can be summed up in this one line: "happy fifty-third birthday, Doctor. Welcome to the first day of your death.... You ruined my life. And now I fully intend to ruin yours." For the first third of the book, I couldn't put it down and the suspense kept mounting. However, while the second third and a good portion of the final third of the book gennerally maintained my interest, I found that it was easy to put down because the story became too drawn out and, at times, predictable. The conclusion was pretty clever but not too unexpected. Overall, The Analyst is a book worth reading but I'd take it from the library or wait for the paperback edition.

I've loved my Evolt Camera and its lenses -- but I've wished that I didn't have carry my two Olympus lenses with me when I was going to be taking images at both shorter and longer focal lengths. Having received the Olympus Zuiko 18mm-180mm ultra zoom lens (which is the equivalent of 35mm-350mm) as a present this Christmas, I no longer have to. This lightweight all-digital lens, made especially for the Olympus four thirds system, receives very sharp, very colorful, distortion-free images. Its weight is a little heavier than either of the two separate lenses that came with the camera and it's not quite as fast a lens. However, neither of these differences diminishes the value this great lens has afforded me. If you are like me and have been inconvenienced by having to lug around all your lenses to assure yourself of being able to capture all the images you want, then the Olympus Zuiko 18mm-180mm lens is for you! I think you'll be very happy with the high quality results you'll get and I know you'll be happy with the convenience it will provide. Enjoy!

The Cobra Event had the potential to be a good story but, unfortunately, it lacked an author who could write fiction. While Preston definitely is familiar with all the details about biological warfare, he has virtually no ability to develop and sustain a plot and in creating rich, interesting characters. All of his characters are cardboard-like figures. The publisher would have been more honest in marketing this book as a scientific documentary on biological warfare than as a suspense thriller. Save yourself the time and possible expense and skip The Cobra Event.

If you a person who enjoys a thriller primarily for its suspense and excitement, Last Man Standing will have the pages flying through your fingertips. While the plot is pretty farfetched and strains credibility, it will most likely hold your interest. However, if strong, believable characters are more, or at least as, important to you as suspense and lots of action when choosing a thriller, then I think you'll feel (as I do) feel that Last Man Standing is entertaining and enjoyable but not fully satisfying. Although it didn't bother me as much as many other reviewers, the &quot;good guy&quot; characters --particularly Web London, the main character-- are too &quot;super hero-ish.&quot; Further, Baldacci's characters in general are two-dimensional at best. Despite these flaws, I found Last Man Standing to be a fast-paced an entertaining read; and a book that I think you might enjoy when you're in the mood to read a book to purely escape from reality.

John Altman's debut novel, A Gathering Of Spies, is a WWII spy thriller that provides a fast read and lots of action. Unfortunately, I can't give this book more than just a &quot;fair&quot; rating (i.e. 2 stars) for two reasons. One reason is that Altman's characters lack sufficient depth for me to care about any of them. The second reason is that while the plot takes many twists and turns, many of them lack credibility and are too predictable. I think Altman has the potential to be a future bestselling author and a writer of well-written books. However,unlike some other reviewers, in my opinion, this particular work does not deserve for Altman to be compared to some of today's better spy thriller authors. Maybe he'll be deserving of this comparison in the future, but not now.

Point Of Law is the first book by Clinton McKinzie, which I decided to read based on the positive reader reviews it generated. Unfortunately for me, I didn't enjoy it very much and, thus, will probably be the last book by Clinton McKinzie I'll read (at least for the foreseeable future). The plot started off interesting and exciting; however, what ultimately developed was mostly predictable. Further, I found the characters to not be particularly well developed, resulting in my not caring one way or the other about what happened to them. The main mystery for me was to see if I could make it to the end without resorting to skimming pages. I must admit that I did not succeed in doing so. If I was to rate this book with a word (rather than a number) I'd assess it as a "fair" read. With so many books out there and so little time to read them, my recommendation is to skip this book -- unless you have a strong interest in rock climbing.

On the plus side, Odd Thomas has an interesting and suspenseful plot and mostly holds your interest. Further, Koontz's writing style keeps you turning the pages non-stop. However, it is not without some important flaws which kept me from rating it higher. The main character, Odd Thomas, who is only twenty and nevers leaves his small Southern California town is written as if he's a wordly, older more sophisticated person, which, for me, detracted from his credibility. Several of the secondary characters are superficially developed. The plot, while interesting, is drawn out far too long. The most interesting and surprising elements don't occur until the last twenty or so pages. This book could have been much more exciting if it was a good 50-75 pages shorter. Given the high praise from Publishers Weekly, which motivated me to read this book, I had very high expectations for Odd Thomas and expected it to be on a par with Watchers, Intensity, Mr. Murder and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. While, Odd Thomas is an entertaining, at times scary and, all in all, a worthwhile read, it is not even close to being in the same league as what I consider to be among the best of Koontz.

Richard Montanari's debut thriller, Deviant Way, has too many flaws to be considered a good book but it does show signs of the potential that this author has fulfilled in his books since The Rosary Girls. Montanari succeeds in writing a book that holds your attention from beginning to end and his writing style enables the pages to fly through your fingers. These qualities in Montanari's debut are ones that he has subsequently come to master. However, Deviant Way's flaws strongly overshadow its fast-paced plot, which involves Detective Jack Paris' search for a serial killer in Cleveland. These flaws include the cast of characters (and especially the main character) not being very well-developed or credible, the author not providing a sufficient explanation into the murderer's motivations for the crimes committed, and the ending being somewhat implausible, not particularly satisfying and somewhat predictable. What made reading Deviant Way interesting for me was to see how much Richard Montanari has improved his writing and storytelling skills since his debut. As a matter of fact, since reading The Rosary Girls and each of his subsequent books, Montanari has become one of my favorite thriller/mystery writers.

Jeffery Deaver is one of my favorite writers. I was really expecting that Garden Of Beasts was going to be one of my favorite books by Deaver yet. Based on the description of the book, I felt that its plot, involving a hit man hired to assassinate one of Hitler's top leaders during the time period of the Olympics in Nazi Berlin, contained all of the ingredients that for me make an exciting thriller. Unfortunately, this book was more of a mystery than a thriller -- with the mystery being how could Deaver write a book that had virtually no excitement for almost three-quarters of the story, and when some action did occur it was largely predictable. The characters were not particularly well-developed and several of them, including the main character, were not very credible. Further, the dialogue was a bit corny. Lastly, while I was hoping that the ending would be satisfying enough to enable me to give the book at least a 3-star rating, it was not to be. I found the ending to be very unrealistic and disappointing. If you are a big Deaver fan like I am, you might be inclined to disregard this review and plunk down your money to be able to read his latest work. If you do, I hope you won't be as disappointed as I was.

When I started reading The Godfather Returns I was expecting to become quickly engrossed in the adventures of the Corleone family and their associates. However, when little that was exciting occurred for much of the first half of the book, I was becoming increasingly disappointed and impatient. My disappointed then changed to considerable pleasure when I realized that this was not really intended to be an exciting book, but rather one that provides an in-depth understanding of the many characters we are so familiar with, as well as many new ones. Further, the book succeeds strongly in describing the various conspiracies and family tensions involving the Godfather. The Godfather Returns is a good supplement to those who were big fans of the book, The Godfather, and of the movies based on the book. Weingartner's provides a lot of "meat to the bones" of the already richly developed, highly memorable characters developed by Mario Puzo. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding on whether or not to read it.

There is never a risk invloved with reading a Daniel Silva book -- the only unknown is will it be a very good book or an excellent book! In Prince Of Fire Gabriel Allon, art restorer and spy, is brought back from Venice to Israel after his cover is blown and his secret history falls into terrorist hands. In delivering a very well told story, rich in suspense, filled with multidimensional characters and ladened with history about the Israeli-Palistinian conflict, Silva continually rises toward the very top echelon of thriller writers. It is a book that will keep you engrossed from start to finish. With that said, Prince Of Fire, to me, was not quite as good as Silva's past three books nor his first book, The Unlikely Spy. And while Gabriel Allon is a fictional character that is about as "real" and interesting as any that has appeared in many years, I would like to see Silva move on to a different character and story line -- at least for one or two books. Having now read all four of Silva's books with Allon, they have become somewhat formulaic. I'm ready for something new and different. I know whatever book Silva writes will be gold!

In his debut, Dave Freedman's Natural Selection scores big with a very entertaining, exciting, edge-of-the-seat thriller. It is the perfect beach read. Natural Selection weaves science and suspense to introduce an extremely dangerous new species of predator that can no longer survive in its natural environment and must seek to survive in man's world. It is one of those books that makes you forget about everything else in order to race through the pages to find out what happens next. While Freedman succeeds in generating and maintaining suspense, his writing style has lots of room for improvement. He needs to learn that in order to create a sense of urgency you don't need to repeat the term "...right now!" ad nauseum (e.g., 'We better get out of here. We better get out of here right now!") or to repeat a term three times (e.g., "Get out! Get out! Get out!"). In addition, Freedman needs to use a thesaurus to come up with an alternative for the word "phenomenal", which he uses over and over. Finally, Freedman's characters, while interesting and fun, would have been more credible in the hands of a more experienced writer. Natural Selection is not the book to read when you're in the mood for great literature. It is, however, a very entertaining and highly recommended book when you're looking for pure escapism. Enjoy!

I was very much expecting to enjoy this book based on its seemingly interesting premise -- i.e., that of a young Boston Irish cop who finds himself in the thick of wartime intrique when he becomes General Eisenhower's personal investigator. Unfortunately, Billy Boyle was a big dissapointment to me. The plot was very slow-moving, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, the mystery was not very mysterious and the excitement level was tepid at best. The biggest mystery to me about this book is why I bothered to finish it. Do yourself a favor and don't be misled by the mostly favorable reviews about Billy Boyle on this site.

Almost 50 years ago I read Leon Uris's Mila 18, which I've considered to be one of my favorite books of all time with one of the most memorable fictional characters ever in Andrei Androfski. Recently, I decided to read this book again, although I have to admit I was a little concerned that it might not live up to the great memories I have of it. My concern was totally unfounded. Mila 18 stands the test of time -- as do all classics; and, in my opinion, Mila 18 is a classic.In Mila 18, Uris, through his fully developed cast of Jewish characters, tells the story of Jewish oppression in Poland soon after the country's being defeated by the Nazis in WWII, followed by the annihilation of half a million Jews from the Warsaw ghetto, and finally the incredible ghetto uprising in which a miniscule Jewish army headed by Andrei Androfski held off the powerful German army for forty-two days and nights.Beyond Andrei Androfski, you'll meet many other very richly developed characters that will likely stay in your memories and hearts for years to come. Further, Uris's narrative and descriptive capabilities will make you feel that you are right there with these characters as they struggle with how to respond to the Nazis, as they go passively to their deaths and, ultimately, when they decide to rise up and fight -- not because of an expectation to survive but for the hope that their uprising will make the rest of the world stand up and take notice.Mila 18 is not an easy read. It will make you infuriated and frustrated for a variety of reasons, it will bring you to tears, and it will make your sense of pride swell to new highs. However, there won't be one second that you'll ever regret making the decision to read this book. I hope you decide to read it or perhaps re-read it, as I did. I can't recommend Mila 18 highly enough!

If this is your first book by Stephen Hunter you'd probably give this book four stars, possibly more. However, having read Point Of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Time To Hunt, Hot Springs etc., Hunter's latest effort doesn't quite measure up. The first half of Pale Horse Coming was in typical Hunter fashion -- action upon action, details about guns, a Swaggert being larger than life. I couldn't put the book down! The second half, however, dragged in too many areas and the action slowed down considerably. Further, many of the events that occurred were somewhat predictable. Overall, Pale Horse Rising is a book I think you'll like -- you just won't love it -- an emotion that true Hunter fans have come to expect (demand?) from his books!

Roses Are Red is a &quot;4 1/2&quot; star book based on its sheer ability to keep you engrossed from the first few pages right up until the final words. Keep in mind that if you're looking for good literature and/or a strong narrative, and/or well-developed characters, this book --as well as all of James Patterson's other books -- will probably not be to your liking. However, if you're seeking a book whose story is packed with suspense, thrills and surprises, and whose writng style will keep you turning the pages at a rapid pace, then grab yourself a copy of Roses Are Red. I think you'll find that for as long as you're reading this book you'll be able to escape into the world of Alex Cross and forget about everything except what is going to happen next. While I've been disappointed in several of James Patterson's recent books, Roses Are Red has helped me to forget about the past. Enjoy!

After the last several duds from Ludlum, he, at long last, has written a book that approaches the quality of some of his early excellent books -- The Gemini Contenders, The Osterman Weekend, The Matarese Circle, etc. The Sigma Protocol is a very fast, spellbinding read that is loaded with suspense, action, and excitement. The only factor keeping me from rating it five stars is that the characters, while serviceable for the purposes of THE STORY, were not as well-developed as I would have hoped. Nevertheless, this is a minor detail and should not deter you from reading The Sigma Protocol. I think you'll find that this 528 page book (I read the hardcover version) will keep you turning the pages as fast as your fingers will allow. Get ready for a very enjoyable &quot;escape&quot; reading experience. Enjoy!

Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy of A Slow Walk To Hell. This book adds to Patrick A. Davis's long list of fast-paced, suspenseful military thrillers. I don't understand why this author isn't a bigger "name" among thriller lovers. A Slow Walk To Hell involves an Air Force investigator assigned to the torture-slaying of an officer who becomes embroiled in a possible hate crime with high-ranking officers and the victim's uncle, the leading presidential candidate, as the chief suspects. Its plot is well-developed and filled with twists and turns, and its characters are multi-dimensional and interesting. If you decide to read A Slow Walk To Hell make sure you have a lot of spare tme because once you start it, I don't think you'll be able to put it down for any length of time. Without going into detail, the reason I'm not giving the book a 5-star rating pertains to its ending, which, while surprising, isn't explained clearly enough (at least for me). Enjoy!

Margolin's latest is a fast-paced, entertaining, but somewhat predictable, thriller. If this is your first book by Phillip Margolin, you'll probably like it a lot and look to read other books by him. If, however, you've read most or all of Margolin's previous works, as I have, you'll likely consider it to be not one of his best.

If you're looking for an exciting, interesting and informative noirish police procedural that will take you back in time to the days just before, during and after the Kennedy assassination, I very much recommend Wisdom Of The Bones to you. The story is about a Dallas homicide detective's attempt to solve one last case involving a young kidnapped girl before he loses his own life to a terminal heart condition.Hyde is meticulous in his research and is terrific in describing this period with accuracy, grit and lots of color. Further, Hyde's suspenseful thriller is filled with real-life characters, about which he provides interesting and many little-known facts (at least to me) that enables this book to rise above the average historical thriller. Of particular interest to me (and I think will be to you, too) were the "factoids" Hyde provides about Jack Ruby. Wisdom Of The Bones is a book that succeeds on many levels ... plot, narrative style, multi-dimensional characters to name just a few ... and is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to read on and on. Christopher Hyde's latest is well worth reading and one that should be near the top of your to-be-read list. Also, I'd recommend that you try Hyde's previous historical thriller, The Second Assassin.

If you like historical fiction and/or have an interest in knowing what made Benedict Arnold's name synonymous for the word &quot;traitor,&quot; Dark Eagle is a book you'll definitely enjoy. Harr demonstrates a strong ability to weave many interesting and little known facts about the Revolutionary War, Benedict Arnold and many other historical figures into a well-written and, at times, suspenseful work of fiction. Further, as some other reviewers have noted, Dark Eagle is rich in visual imagery that makes you feel you are right in the middle of the action. Dark Eagle should find a large audience among those who are fans of books about history, war and even suspense.

...you are interested in a well-written page-turner that -- like Winegardner's previous book, The Godfather Returns -- is driven mainly by its excellent character development. If, however, your interest is in a book that is filled with suspense and action, The Godfather's Revenge may not be for you. Winegardner not only strongly succeeds in taking the Corleone Family into the early '60s, he provides a very rich and well-developed characterization of two people that had a strong influence on the Corleone Family and its actions over the years -- Nick Geraci and Tom Hagen. Be aware that the focus of The Godfather's Revenge is on these characters; Michael Corleone, while always a powerful force in this series, is more of a secondary character. Most of the other characters from the past book are back in "Revenge" and Winegardner very effectively expands our understanding of them -- and particularly the female characters. Beyond the book's strength in the above areas, it -- in a somewhat quiet but powerful way -- weaves a fictionalized tale of some of the important historical events occurring in the time period in which this book takes place and of the Mafia's, and the Corleone's, role in influencing them (e.g., the presidential assassination, the Attorney General's (the president's brother's) "war" with the Mafia, the Bay of Pigs incident, etc.). Overall, The Godfather's Revenge is a book I'd highly recommend to those interested in the Godfather series and who enjoyed Winegardner's last book, as well as to anyone interested in a well-written book that succeeds on many levels. Once again, please be aware that The Godfather's Revenge is not the fastest "read" out there, but it is a highly satisfying book. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding on whether or not to read The Godfather's Revenge.

Drop Shot has it all! Fast-moving storyline, great characters,witty dialogue and, best of all, lots of surprises. This is the first book I've read by Harlan Coben (although I have his latest, One False Move)and I definitely plan to get the rest in the Simon Bolivar series. I highly recommend Drop Shot to anyone who enjoys mysteries!

When I read Irish writer Glenn Meade's Snow Wolf after its release in the U.S. in 1996, it became one of my all-time favorite international thrillers. In subsequent years I enjoyed, though to a lesser extent, three of his other books: Brandenburg, Sands Of Sakkara and Resurrection Day. When I recently saw, while checking the Amazon-U.K. site, that Meade had written two other books that were not published in the U.S., I ordered them from an Amazon-UK reseller. Upon their arrival, I immediately started Web Of Deceit -- and that's when my anticipated excitement turned into sheer astonishment. That is, after reading over 1,000 books over the years, I was astonished that Web of Deceit turned out to be one of the worst books, if not the worst book, I have ever read. The basic plot concept of Web Of Deceit is a decent one --i.e., NY attorney, Jennifer March, is haunted by the mysterious and savage slaughter of her family on the same night that her father disappeared, never to be seen again. Then two years later, his corpse is discovered frozen into a remote glacier in the Swiss Alps, the victim of a bizarre murder, and Jennifer goes off to Europe to identify the body and to seek answers. However, Meade's execution of this plot is a disaster in so many ways that I don't want to waste your time reading about them in any detail. Suffice it to say, the events that occur are totally implausible and this is the BEST of the WORST of what is bad about the book. What makes Web Of Deceit so bad is that: (1) each and every character is so poorly developed and unbelievable that they are like cartoon characters, and (2) the dialogue that Meade has the characters' speak is so unrealistic and cliche ridden that I often found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief. Aside from my extreme dissatisfaction with Web Of Deceit, what I found most astonishing is what I learned about myself from this reading experience, which is that I must be a real glutton for punishment since I read the book to the very end. Now the question is: do I even bother to read the second of the two books by Meade that I ordered from the UK, or do I throw it, along with Web Of Deceit, in the trash?

Trunk Music is another consistently good book in the Harry Bosch series. The story is fast-moving and very enjoyable. The growth of Bosch as a continuing character is well-developed , and should be obvious to his fans who have read his books sequentially.

False Impression, Jeffrey Archer's latest thriller, is the epitome of a "beach read." It immediately captures and then holds the reader's attention throughout. The plot, which involves the mysteries surrounding Van Gogh's last painting, is fast paced and,for the most part, maintains a relatively high level of excitement. Further, the characters, while not especially well developed are interesting enough. What keeps me from rating the book higher is the fact that I was able to predict virtually all of the events that were supposedly intended by Archer to represent the book's surprises and twists and turns. Nonetheless, False Impression provided me with several hours of entertainment when relaxing recently at the beach. False Impression is far from being Jeffrey Archer's best book, but it is one that I think you will enjoy if you are willing to accept an average to slightly above average performance from an author that is capable of much more.

James Huston has done what few writers succeed in doing -- creating a sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original. I would have rated this book &quot;4 1/2 stars&quot; if the Amazon rating system allowed me to.Like Balance Of Power, The Price Of Power is a political/military thriller that grabs your attention right from the start and never lets go. The action is electrifying, the characters are very well- developed and the dialogue is crisp and realistic. You could almost envision seeing and listening to Bill Clinton in some respects if you try real hard. While 501 pages in length, there isn't one page that you'll be sorry you read.The Price Of Honor is a book you won't want to miss. But do yourself a favor and read Balance Of Power first. Enjoy them both!

At Risk, Rimington's debut spy thriller shows her potential as a writer but, overall, the book has too many flaws to consider it as anything more than just an okay read. Rimington, the former head of Britain's MI5, creates an interesting plot premise -- the British Intelligence Joint Counter-Terrorism Group has uncovered information about the ultimate intelligence nightmare. That is, a terrorist group may have activated an "invisible" agent (i.e., an ethnic native of the target country who can cross its borders unchecked and go unnoticed) in order to set up the foundation for monstrous harm. It is up to Rimington's main character, Intelligence Officer Liz Carlisle to analyze the information from her agents to determine if there is, indeed, an imminent terrorist threat and, if so, to figure out the invisible's point of entry. In the process of establishing At Risk's plot, Rimington works hard at creating an understanding of what the professional and personal life is like for a female Intelligence Officer employed in this tradional all-male environment and at introducing the reader to many secondary characters. Thoughout the first half of this book Rimington succeeds pretty well in telling an interesting story and in maintaining this reader's interest. However, in the second half of the book, I found the plot getting so bogged down in the extensive amount of information analyses that Carlisle had to do that, while this may be very realistic of the job of an Intelligence Officer, my attention level steadily diminished to the point that I was skimming certain passages in order to get to "the finish line." Further, the ending, while again realistic, was neither very surprising nor particularly thrilling. Further, in my opinion Rimington left too many of the threads untied in regards to Liz Carlisle's realtionships with some of the secondary characters. Hopefully, Rimington will tie these threads together in her next book, which I will probably read given the promise she ehibited in her debut.

I obtained The Ryer Avenue Story in 1993 and it has sat in my bookcase until recently. The experience of reading this book proves the veracity of the old adage, "Good things come to those who wait." The Ryer Avenue Story is a saga that spans about four decades and reaches beyond a murder at its center toward greater truths about family, guilt, and ambition. It is an excellent book and perhaps Uhnak's best to-date. Although The Ryer Avnenue Story is not a fast read, it holds your interest from beginning to end and has a variety of well-developed, believable characters that will stay in your memory well after you finish the book. Do yourself a favor and try to find a copy of this book -- I think you'll enjoy The Ryer Avenue Story very much.

In typical Patterson fashion, First To Die is a fast-paced read with lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed the basic plot Patterson has created; I only wish he'd remember how to &quot;write&quot; a story that has credible characters with some depth to them. A particular concern is Patterson's inability to write in the first person about a woman protagonist. Her feelings come across as too cliched. His description of Lindsay's, the main character, romance with her new love interest is too sappy. His other characters are mostly one-dimensional and I often had trouble getting into their heads (and after awhile I gave up trying to). Lastly, his dialogue is at best mediocre and, at times, is childish and unrealistic. While I don't often let these criticisms interfere with my ability to enjoy a book, this wasn't the case for me with First To Die. I found these criticisms to be distracting and annoying enough to prevent me from rating this book with any more than 2 1/2 stars. I doubt I'll be buying any more books in this series, and if I do it won't be in hardcover.

Hot Springs is another in the line of fast-paced, highly entertaining, action-packed books from Stephen Hunter. This one has Bob Lee Swagger's father, Earl, as the main character. As you will see if you are a fan of Hunter's books, several of the characters appearing in Hot Springs were also in Dirty White Boys (whose setting is several years later). In the absolute, Hot Springs is a book I enjoyed a lot and I think you will, too. Comparatively, however, it does not quite measure up to Hunter's more recent books (i.e. Point Of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Black Light and Time To Hunt)in terms of suspense and credibility. But don't let this deter you from reading Hot Springs. As I said, it is a very enjoyable book.

This product produces high quality, true-to-life color photos. It is very convenient to load the ink cartridge and paper into your printer and it only takes about a minute or so per print. The convenience can't be beat (versus taking the time to bring your memory card/stick or emailing the digital images you want to be developed to an outide processor. Keep in mind that while the Sony SVM-75LS Ink and Paper Value Pack represents a good value, it still is usually more expensive than using an outside vendor. If your interest is obtaining high quality prints in a fast, convenient manner at a good value than this product should definitely satisfy your need. Enjoy!

In Reckless Homicide, first-time novelist, Ira Genberg, has written a legal thriller that is at least as good as--and possibly better than--the best of Grisham, Turow, J.F. Freedman, et al. The plot never wanes in its excitement, the characters are very interesting and well-developed, the dialog rings true, and surprises pop up throughout the story. Be ready to be glued to your seat once you start this book!

The Oath is the first book I've read by John Lescroart but won't be the last. Lescroart's strong suits are in his ability to develop multidimensional, credible major as well as secondary characters, believable multilayered story lines, and witty dialogue -- all of which are intertwined in an entertaining, fast-moving mystery. The basic plot involves an HMO executive who becomes a victim of a hit-and-run driver and then a murder victim after being brought to one of his own hospitals for treatment. Dismas Hardy becomes the defense attorney for the doctor presumed to be the murderer and Lt. Glitsky is in charge of the murder investigation. The relationship between Hardy and Glitsky is one I enjoyed very much and am looking forward to learning more about when I read other books in the series. Without going into detail (and perhaps spoiling things for potential readers), what keeps me from giving The Oath a higher rating is that I found its ending to be a bit predictable in some ways and a bit far-fetched in others. Nonetheless, The Oath is worth reading and is a book I think you'll enjoy.

Omerta is a rich, powerful epitaph to Puzo's mafia trilogy. It well deserves the large reading audience it will definitely attract. Typical of all of Puzo's books, Omerta grabs your attention and never lets go, it's filled with action and suspense, and it's loaded with interesting characters. Omerta' s greatest quality, however, is Puzo's narrative style, in which you can feel every emotion his characters are feeling and vividly picture every setting in which his characters appear. Omerta is without question a fitting memorial to a great writer. The only reason I didn't give Omerta a 5-star rating is that would make it equivalent to 'The Godfather', which it is not. But than again, how many books are? Make yourself an offer you can't refuse and buy a copy of Omerta. Enjoy!

Overall, I'd rate Clarkson's New Lots 3 1/2 stars. It's filled with action, excitement and more action and excitement; and on these dimensions I'd give the book 4 1/2 stars. However, the plot, which is somewhat simplistic, and the characters, which are only fairly well-developed, deserve only 2 1/2 stars. New Lots is a book that I think you'll enjoy a lot when you're in the mood for total escapism and not much more.

Overall, it's, at best, a little better than average book. Once again, Patterson creates an interesting plot (although not nearly as exciting, surprising and original as many of his earlier Alex Cross books) -- but, also once again, he has become too willing to settle for mediocrity in his writing style. His characters are superficially developed and the dialogue he has them speak is just serviceable. If you decide to read Patterson's latest book be forewarned that, as with all but his earliest books, you must be willing to forego most of the qualities you would normally look for in a good book -- and a good writer. Expect not much more than a book that will provide fast-paced, light entertainment. While I used to read anything that had the "James Patterson" name on it, I now only read the Alex Cross books; but do so with decreasing enthusiasm. It would be nice to see Patterson return to showing interest in having "quality" associated with his works rather than "quantity." His "paint by numbers" formulaic writing approach has enabled him to spew out 3 or 4 books a year, and thus become an industry unto himself, so to speak. It's probably naive of me to expect him to sacrifice some of the "green" he is raking in with his "quantity vs. quantity" approach to writing -- but I can only hope. Personally, I'm growing increasingly tired of Cross's sickening sweet family members (i.e, Nana Mama, Damon and Jannie) and the girlfriend de jour) that Patterson incorporates in each book in this series. Further, I'm getting a bit tired of Patterson leaving too many elements within the story unanswered in order to bait you into reading the next book (e.g. why the facial cuts? is he returning to the FBI, etc.) Nonetheless, Mary, Mary will probably do for you what it did for me --"scratch my itch" for a fast-paced, "all plot and little else" book I can lose myself in.

In California Gold, John Jakes has once again created a very engrossing story wrapped in lots of interesting history about California. As usual, his plot moves along at a brisk pace and he introduces many interesting characters -- both fictional and real-life. The main character, James Macklin Chance, is one of Jakes' more memorable ones. I'm sure you'll enjoy how he comes to California as a young man, poor financially but rich in ambition, and his adventures in building one fortune on top of another. If you enjoy historical fiction, and especially if you're a John Jakes fan, do yourself a favor and get a copy of California Gold. You'll be richer for the reading experience.

The only positive for me from reading The Bridge Of Sighs, Olen Steinhauer's first novel, was to learn how much he improved as a writer and storyteller in his latest books, The Tourist and The Nearest Exit; both of which I thought were very good.In Steinhauer's attempt at a literary crime novel, the plot takes place in 1948, three years after the Russians liberated this small (not specified) Eastern European nation from German occupation. However, the Red Army still patrols the capital's rubble-strewn streets, and the ideals of the Revolution are but memories. In this environment, a young, inexperienced homicide detective, who spent the war years working on a fishing boat in Finland, finally gets his chance to serve his country working for the People's Militia by investigating the murder of a state songwriter.Based on my strong enjoyment of Steinhauer's The Tourist and The Nearest Exit, I was anticipating liking this book as well. Unfortunately, although I forced myself to finish The Bridge Of Sighs, I disliked it a lot. Steinhauer did moderately well in creating a rich sense of atmosphere but the book was disappointing in all other elements I look for in a good novel. The plot was weak, unoriginal and boring for the most part, the characters were uninteresting, unlikable and lacked dimension, and the book lacked a sustainable level of action and excitement. Suffice it to say that I'm glad I read Steinhauer's last two books before reading The Bridge Of Sighs because I might not have ever read these two books if I read The Bridge Of Sighs first.

I have been a big fan of Larry Collins' books over the years and started off very engrossed in his latest, The Road To Armageddon, as well. However, the extreme amount of detail Collins offers on everything from money laundering to obtaining materials for use in developing nuclear devices made me feel I was reading a &quot;How To&quot; primer rather than a thriller. As a result, after forcing myself to read about half of the book, I had to give up. Life is too short and there are too many books to read to make me try to finish this book. I wouldn't be surpised that if I was able to finish the book, it would have been a good read. Most of Collins' books are. But, I guess, the ability to work your way through the overwhelming amount of detail requires much more willpower than I have. I can't say that The Road To Armageddon is a bad book, since I wasn't able to finish it. The purpose of my review is to alert you to what you are in for should you attempt to read The Road To Armageddon. Caveat emptor!

Ties That Bind features lawyer Amanda Jaffe -- returning from her harrowing experience in Wild Justice -- to take on a case that no one will take. The plot revolves around the owner of an upscale call-girl service accused of murdering a U.S. Senator, and of his claiming to have proof of the existence of a secret society of powerful men who have banded together for a commonly held political agenda. In typical Margolin style, the plot moves at a brisk pace and is laced with several twists and turns that will keep you guessing about what is to happen next. Unlike Margolin's earlier expertise, however, in creating multidimensional characters that you really care about, I found Amanda Jaffe to be a little boring and without a lot of depth; with the latter also being how I felt about many of the other characters in Ties That Bind. Having stated this criticism, Margolin's books are always fun to read and keep the pages flying through your fingers. If you are in the mood for a fast-paced book in which you can easily lose yourself, Ties That Bind is one you should consider. While it is not as good as many of Margolin's earlier books (such as Gone, But Not Forgottern, After Dark, Heartstone and The Last Innocent Man), Ties That Bind is a book I think you will enjoy.

not one of the best. In typical Lawrence Block style, he continues to evolve Matthew Scudder into one of the most multi-dimensional protagonists "alive" in any mystery series today. Block's writing is always strong and he continues to develop interesting supporting and secondary characters as well as subplots that hold your interest almost as much as the main character and plot. Further, his description of the sights and sounds of NYC make you feel that you are right there with Scudder experiencing them. As an intense mystery, however, Hope To Die, while entertaining and enjoyable, is not quite up to par with many of the earlier books in the series. While I was anticipating giving Hope To Die a rating between 4 and 5 stars during the first three-quarters of the book, I found the ending a bit weak and unbelievable, which caused me to lower my rating to between 3 1/2 and 4 stars. Overall, Hope To Die is a worthwhile read for those who, like myself, are familiar with the series, but is not the book I would recommend to those interested in starting this series. Despite some weaknesses in this book, the Matthew Scudder series continues to be one of my favorites and I'm looking forward to joining him on his next unofficial private investigation.

Embedded within Personal Injuries is what could have been an interesting plot. HOWEVER, Turow feels it necessary to describe in excrutiating detail every thought, every feeling, every rationale for these thoughts and feelings of every major and minor character in this book. As a consequence, I feel that I, personally, have suffered a personal injury trying to force myself to read Turow's latest effort. Finally, after making myself read about 1/3 of the book, my disgust with Personal Injuries won out and I gave up on it. It's possible that people who read books mainly for in-depth characterizations versus plot will enjoy this book. But,for me, the following saying was the basis for my decision to not waste any more time reading this book, 'so many books, so liitle time.'

I've read all of Demille's books and liked them all; of course, to varying degrees. I was very much looking forward to reading his latest, Wild Fire, prior to its release. Overall, Wild Fire held my interest from beginning to end -- but it is definitely not up to par for Demille. I found the premise of the plot to be interesting and and was expecting Demille to deliver the plot with his usual amount of suspense and surprises. Ultimately, however, the level of suspense was very limited, as was the surprise level. Further, the surprises Demille attempts to deliver are highly predictable. My main problem with Wild Fire was not the story, which, as I said, was entertaining enough. My problem pertains to my rapidly growing dislike for Demille's main character, John Corey, who has now been the featured character in three books. Corey's constant wise cracks and know-it-all attitude is much more annoying to me than humorous, and Demille has allowed Corey to become "the real story" in Wild Fire. I'm about to the point that I might skip future Demille books that focus on Corey. In addition, while character development is usually a major strength of Demille, almost all of the other characters in Wild Fire are one-dimensional at best, and the villain lacks credibilty. I don't think you'll dislike Wild Fire, and if its your first Demille book, you'll probably be very satisfied by it. However, if you're a long-time Demille fan, I think you'll find it, as I did, to not be up to this author's usual high standard.

Be prepared to rarely get up from your seat once you start Chosen Prey. Sandford's characters are very credible, three dimensional and well-developed, and Lucas Davenport continues to be one of the more interesting &quot;good guys&quot; in crime fiction. The plot is very suspenseful and riveting. In typical Sandord style, there is no surprise as to who the killer is, yet the need for non-stop reading of his books is to see how the killer is caught. If you've read some of the other books in the &quot;Prey&quot; series, you'll know that how the criminal is brought to justice is not always in the way you'd suspect. Chosen Prey is a book I think you'll enjoy very much. As I said, though, be prepared to delay other things you need to do because you won't want to put this book down. It's well worth you're time and money.

Overall, The Apprentice held my interest and I enjoyed it. However, this sequel to The Surgeon pales in comparison. For my taste, Gerritsen spent too much time discussing the concerns and fears of her main character, Jane Rizzoli, and not enough with the serial killer, Warren Hoyt and in providing exciting twists and turns. I kept waiting and waiting for the suspense to build to a slam-bang ending; however, the ending was much too abrupt and not very suspenseful, and, thus, left me somewhat disappointed. If you've read The Surgeon and are interested in finding out what happens next, The Apprentice is a worthwhile read. But, as I said, it's far from her best works. I'd recommend that you read some of Gerritsen's earlier books such as Harvest and The Surgeon.

The English Assassin has a lot of good things working for it -- a fast-paced plot, lots of action, decently developed characters, and an interesting historical perspective about the Swiss-Nazi relationship during WWII. I found that I could not put the book down throughout the first half. However, I felt that the second half dragged somewhat and the ending, while still filled with action, left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. This is due to its containing few surprises and being somewhat predictable. Further, Silva's conclusion left some 'threads too loosely tied' for my taste. Perhaps this is because he plans to continue his main character, Gabriel Allon, and his secondary characters, Ari Shamron and Julian Isherwood, all of whom were in Silva's The Kill Artist, in future books. While I continue to like these characters, I think that knowing that he plans to use them in other books detracted from the suspense of the ending. With this said, The English Assassin was an entertaining read and one that I, overall, think you would enjoy. It's just that if you have read Silva's other books, as I have, you might feel that his latest effort isn't among the strongest of his works.Also recommended: All of Daniel Silva's previous books, Snow Wolf by Glenn Meade and Jackdaws by Ken Follett.

This review is written by my daughter for whom I obtained a copy of A Desirable Residence.Being a huge Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella fan I was very excited to hear that a new book of hers was coming out. I jumped into reading A Desirable Residence with much excitement but that excitement faded pretty quickly! Usually when reading Wickham/Kinsella's books I get so deeply into them from page one that I can't seem to put it down. However, with A Desirable Residence I couldn't seem to ever want to pick it up! My only incentive to keep reading was so that I could finish the book and start on a new one. In her defense, Wickham did, as usual, a great job of getting the reader into the minds of the characters and understanding what they are thinking and feeling. Unfortunately, I found the overall story of the book to be quite uneventful and even boring. It wasn't until towards the end of the book that things started to get slightly interesting where I found myself wondering how things would turn out -- but then the ending turned out rather anti-climactic. The only excitement I got out of this book was completing it so I can move onto another that hopefully does a better job in keeping me captivated. Let me just clear up, though, that my status as a major Wickham/Kinsella fan has not changed at all! I would still highly recommend all of her books (minus this one) and will continue to read any new ones that come out in the future!

Typical of a book by Philip Margolin, The Associate is written in a style that makes the pages fly by, has an interesting plot and builds to a suspenseful conclusion. It's the type of book that is good for a plane trip or beach vacation. However, unlike most of Margolin's other books, The Associate lacks the intense courtroom drama, his characters are more superficial and the outcome was too predictable. Having read all of Margolin's other books, The Associate, while enjoyable and entertaining, is nowhere near the top of his works. If you, too, are a Margolin fan, I think, on a comparative basis, you might feel mildly disappointed but, overall, I think you'll consider The Associate to be a fun read. If you haven't read Margolin before, I'd very highly recommend Gone But Not Forgotten, Heartstone, The Last Innocent Man, After Dark and Wild Justice.

Cry Wolf is the mediocre result you get when an author tries to go back and convert an earlier effort which was in the &quot;romance&quot; genre --the genre in which Tami Hoag started writing -- into a thriller -- the genre in which Hoag has achieved her fame.Until Cry Wolf, I have been a big fan of Tami Hoag, enjoying thrillers such as Night Sins, Guilty As Sin, etc. very much. Cry Wolf, however, is mostly a soap opera. The mystery/suspense doesn't even begin to come into play until about 1/2 way into this 529 page paperback. Since I am an avid reader of thrillers, I was somewhat disappointed that, despite the fact that a number of murders did happen, the suspense was unsatisfying for me. I kept hoping that as I read on the suspense would build; but, it did not. Bottom line is if you're a &quot;romance&quot; reader who likes some mystery/suspense, this is a book you'll enjoy (and probably a lot). However, this book will probably disappoint you, as it did me, if you are a thriller lover looking for an exciting &quot;read.&quot;

I first read Battle Cry in the early 60's when I was a young teenager and loved everything about it -- the characters, the description of Marine life, the battle scenes. You name it, I loved it about Battle Cry. For all of these years when people would ask me what novel about WWII I thought was among the best I've read, Battle Cry was right at the top of my list. So, after almost fifty years since reading Battle Cry, I decided to read it again. I'm mostly sorry I did. With the exception of the last 50-60 pages, which were very impactful and emotional, virtually all of the aspects that I initially thought were so terrific "back then," I now consider to be somewhat of a disappointment. The characters I once considered to be so memorable I now think of as being pretty thinly developed. The dialogue now seems quite weak and the battle/action scenes, which at times are very exciting, do not comprise enough of this war novel to maintain a high level of interest. As such, I found the book, at almost 700 pages, dragged on for long passages, causing me to to skim through much of the second half. I guess my decision to revisit Battle Cry after an almost fifty year absence was a mistake; helping me to realize that some things are better left as fond memories from a time long gone.

What you get when you mix the interesting character of Aloysius Prendergast wih his brilliant, diabolical brother, Diogenes Prendergast -- both of whom have a deep hatred for each other, is a crime story that represents a very successful continuation of the thrilogy begun with Brimstone. Dance Of Death, while at times goes overboard in terms of credibility, is a story filled with thrills and excitement. It's the type of plot readers have come to expect from Preston & Child -- one that will keep you fully absorbed in order to see what will happen next. If you've read some this writing team's other books, such as Relic, Reliquary, The Cabinet Of The Curiosities & Brimstone, you'll be familiar with, and glad to see again, some of the characters featured in Dance Of Death. Book two in the trilogy is well-worth reading and is every bit as good as the first book, Brimstone.

Stephen Hunter has been one of my favorite authors since his book, The Day Before Midnight, and I've loved all of his Swagger books, particularly those featuring Bob Lee Swagger. However, Hunter's latest, Havana, was a major disappointment to me. The plot - about the CIA's recruitment of Earl Lee Swagger to Havana to assassinate Fidel Castro - is very simplistic and predictable. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional, including some real-life people who appear in this book, such as Fidel Castro, Meyer Lansky and Ernest Hemingway. Even Earl Lee Swagger is not as interesting as in Hot Springs and Pale Horse Coming. Unlike the non-stop excitement and action that permeates all of Hunter's previous books, the suspense in Havana is much more tepid and very sporadic. Very little in the way of suspense really happens until the last 75-100 pages and even then, as I mentioned, you'll probably be able to predict most, if not all, of what eventually occurs. I know that criticizing this book will probably generate many "unhelpful" votes from Hunter's many fans who are not willing to accept that one of his Swagger books could be deserving of less than 4 stars. However, I'm willing to take this risk since my primary concern is to spare you from - or at least prepare you for - a sub-par performance from Hunter. Hopefully, this review is helpful to you in deciding whether or not you want to read Havana.

In typical Tess Gerritsen fashion, The Surgeon is a book that gets your attention right from the start and doesn't wane throughout this fast-paced medical thriller. The plot, which is described in many of the earlier reviews, is well-developed and exciting. However, I was a little disappointed in that I was able to guess too many of the events that ultimately occurred and the reasons for them too far in advance. Nonetheless, The Surgeon is well worth reading and should keep you engrossed. Enjoy!

This is the first book I've read by Kathy Reichs. Having read all the favorable reviews...prior to reading Fatal Voyage, I was really looking forward to an exciting, suspenseful story. While the plot starts off strong and, for the most part, held my interest, I was expecting much more. I'd describe the suspense tepid, the characters only moderately interesting and the climax just mildly satisfying. Overall, by the time I approached the final quarter of Fatal Voyage, I was more interested in finishing the book than caring a lot about how it ended. Overall, Fatal Voyage is not a bad book -- it's just average. I will read another Reichs book but not in the near future.

Frederick Forsyth has been one of my favorite authors since his classic, The Day Of The Jackal. For about the first quarter of his latest, The Afghan, I thought I was in for another treat from this very talented writer. The plot about a planned Al Qaeda terrorist attack designed to make the 9/11 attack seem small showed great promise. However, Forsyth got so bogged down in presenting all of the details from the extensive research he did that it seriously interfered with, and often overshadowed, the intended suspense. For me, rather than creating a sense of excitement and thrills, I found many parts of The Afghan to be boring. Another disappointing element of The Afghan is that its main character, while obviously a hero, is not one you get a sense of "knowing," which is usually one of the strong points in a Forsyth novel. All in all, The Afghan is not a bad book; but it does not come close to living up to its potential and it is not one I'd recommend you rush out to read.

While The White Road has many characters to keep track of, which at times makes the story a bit hard to follow without a scorecard (so to speak), Connolly again proves himself to be among the best of the contemporary suspense writers. Connolly is a not only a master in providing compelling plots featuring his dark, somewhat tormented hero, Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, his even stronger abilities are in developing vivid and very credible characters and in providing very graphic,compelling and emotionally-charged narratives and images. The basic plot of The White Road involves Parker going to South Carolina to help an old friend and attorney defend a young black man facing the death penalty. It's a case that nobody wants to be involved in and one deeply rooted in old evil. If you're interested in a very good, well-written story and one that will keep you glued to your seat, I'd highly recommend The White Road to you (as well as each of Connolley's other books).

Par for the course, Deaver's latest Lincoln Rhyme novel is an excellent, very fast-paced thriller, with what an almost never-ending supply of plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat in constant suspense -- and that's no illusion. This book is magical in more ways than one -- in its ability to misdirect you at almost every turn in the story, in the &quot;inside&quot; information it provides about some feats of illusion you may have seen done by David Copperfield and David Blane and in its ability to make the hours you spend reading this book seem like minutes. Deaver continues to evolve his main characters, Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs, as well as many of his supporting characters in a very interesting way that enables this series to stay fresh and exciting. Enjoy!

Demille has done it again! Plum Island has it all for those looking for an exciting book to enjoy at the beach or anyplace else you go to escape and relax. It's loaded with well-developed characters, hot action scenes and light, breezy dialogue. The plot is always enteraining and fast-paced; although at times, a bit predictable. DeMille's latest is well-worth your investment but don't expect it to be in the same league as Word Of Honor, The Gold Coast and The Charm School

When it was suggested that I read The Kite Runner, I put off doing so for a long time because I am primarily a "thriller/suspense/mystery" type-of-guy. That was a mistake that I'm glad I eventually corrected. The Kite Runner is an astonishing, powerful book that had me riveted from the first to the last page. It is a story of fierce cruelty and yet redeeming love, as well as of an intimate account of family and friendship. Both transform the life of Amir, the main character, who comes of age during the last peaceful days of the Afghani monarchy; just before Afghanistan's revolution and its invasion by Russian troops. Hosseini is a masterful writer whose prose and narrative style ooze emotion. If you have any hesitancy about reading this book, as I did, put your doubts aside and rush out to get yourself a copy of The Kite Runner. You'll be very glad you did. It is not only a book that will keep you from doing anything else but turning the pages, it is a book that will stay in your head and heart for years to come. It is that good!

Overall I'd give a 3 1/2 star rating to Still Life With Crows. I have been a very big fan of Preston & Child's books, especially Relic, Reliquary and The Cabinet of Curiousities. Having read the first 2/3s of Still Life With Crows, I felt sure this was going to be another of their books worthy of a five star recommendation. Then came the last third! Aside from the chase being much too long and drawn it, which was causing me to lose interest, the ending was ridiculous, ludicrous and unbelievable. And to make matters worse, I guessed who the killer was too early on in the book. As to the principal character, Pendergast, whom I thought was great in The Cabinet Of Curiousities, the authors have made him a little too super-humanish in this book, which, at times, made me feel that it might be good for Preston & Child to "retire" him, at least for awhile. I don't think this is going to happen, however, at least until after the author's next joint effort, given the the few scenes involving Pendergast and Wren. It seems that their next book might be a sequel to The Cabinet Of Curiousities featuring Pendergast and Wren. All in all, Still Life With Crows isn't a BAD book (even with its very far-fetched ending). It's just that I felt disappointed based on the high standards I've come to expect from these two very talented authors.

The WWII thriller is my favorite genre and the plot of The Second Objective seemed like it would be right up my alley; i.e., a special group of twenty German commandos who face almost certain death to achieve a "second objective" during a last ditch effort to defeat the western allies in late 1944. However, Mark Frost's unbelievable, one-dimensional main characters, coupled with the unrealistic, flawless American-style English dialogue they speak and their ability to have at their fingertips minute details of specific aspects of American life, took away the pleasure I was hoping to get from reading this book. Further, while the book has its share of murders, Frost describes them in a pretty actionless and unexciting manner. Obviously, I was highly disappointed in The Second Objective and do not recommend it to you.

The basic premise of The Runner and the description of the post-WWII period in Germany are very interesting. However, Reich's writing style has made his latest suspense thriller somewhat lacking in &quot;the stuff&quot; I need to keep me, and I think many readers of this genre need to keep them, on &quot;the edge of their seat.&quot; For instance, the main character and key supporting characters are not interesting enough, and so I found myself not caring as much as I probably should have about what happens to them. Further, the action sequences were not plentiful enough for my taste and were too spread out when they did occur. As a consequence of these limitations, I found The Runner, overall, to be moderately enjoyable but a book that was easy for me to put down to do other things and not be in a rush to get back to.

If you're a regular reader of Coben's books, as I am, you know that once you start one of his books you won't be able to put it down. No Second Chance is no exception to the &quot;Coben rule.&quot; With that said, Coben's latest book ranks a notch below his two other stand-alones, Gone For Good and Tell No One. However, it is still a book very much worth reading. While the first two-thirds of No Second Chance is very suspenseful, the last third, while also suspenseful, loses some of its credibility --especially when the character, Verne, is introduced. Further, I found that while Coben ties all of the pieces of his puzzle together well in the end, the ending is somewhat predictable and didn't leave me fully satisfied. These are not MAJOR criticisms and should NOT deter you from reading this book, especially if this is your first book by Coben. For me, these criticisms stem from the fact that I'm not used to any --even minor - -criticisms with Coben's books. He remains one of my favorite authors.

Incident At Twenty-Mile is a western that has well-developed characters and an interesting plot. The story builds to a point where where you expect really a memorable ending. While the conclusion is satisfying, the author allows it to end much too quickly. All in all, the book is one you won't be sorry you read but it leaves you with a feeling of slight disappointment for not fulfilling all of the great expectations you had prior to reaching the end.

Stephen Carter is an excellent writer but The Emperor Of Ocean Park is not an easy book to read. I'd suggest you only attempt to read this 654 page book when you are willing to invest a lot of time and patience in wading through Carter's extensive descriptive passages in order to for the plot to move along. The plot, itself, while very slow moving, is intelligently crafted. The characters are very well-developed and are probably what is most memorable about this book. On a few occasions early on in the book I had to force myself to keep from moving on to another book due to the snail's pace of the story line, even though I was enjoying the high quality of Carter's writing. All in all, reading The Emperor Of Ocean Park is &quot;work&quot; -- but pleasurable work. I think you'll enjoy this literary mystery but,as I said, only attempt reading it when you're in a particularly patient frame of mind.

When I first started reading American Tabloid I thought I was in for a real treat. However, after reading a few hundred pages, I started to realize I didn't care about the characters due to the one-dimensionality Ellroy gives them. Further, the plot, while moving at a fast-pace, was not well-developed and I was really tiring of Ellroy's writing style. While I pushed myself to read further(largely because I had already bought Ellroy's sequel to American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand), I finally had to give up on it after getting to the half way point. Now I have to see if I can exchange The Cold Six Thousand. I know many of you reading this review will be skeptical given the many very favorable reviews previously written about American Tabloid. The only thing I can say to this is if you feel you must read this book, take it from the library. Please don't waste your money like I did.

The Frumious Bandersnatch is about an up-and-coming music star who is kidnapped from a rented yacht while performing at a party promoting her first album. In typical McBain fashion, his latest 87th Precinct police procedural combines an enjoyable, fast-paced plot with true-to-life characters and dialogue. Having said this, on a comparative basis, The Frumious Bandersnatch has a somewhat more predictable ending and has less action and surprises than several of McBain's previous books. Further, I found a few of the romatic sub-storylines (i.e., those involving Detctives Hawes and Ollie Weeks Hawes) to be more filler than having anything to do with the real plot of the book. If you're a fan of the 87th Precinct series I think you might feel (as I do) that The Frumious Bandersnatch is a good, fast enjoyable book but one that is a slight notch below some of the others in this series.

Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code very much. However, Angels And Demons was a major disappointment. Is it possible that Brown improved as a writer so much from the time period between writing Angels And Demons and The DaVinci Code? While The Da Vinci Code isn't the most well written book you're likely to read, it is one of the more compelling, interesting and exciting books you're likely to read. In contrast, Angels And Demons possesses none of these positive attributes. The plot moves along at much too slow a pace, the dialogue is unrealistic and stilted, and the characters are not developed well enough. These contrasts are puzzling to me since these two stories are very much alike. Perhaps I've just solved my own puzzlement -- that is, having read The Da Vinci Code first, I was bored with Angels And Demons because it's essentially a much weaker version of essentially the same plot. Do yourself a favor if you haven't read The Da Vinci Code, go right out and get yourself a copy. BUT once you've read it and enjoyed it do NOT fall into the trap of wanting to read its prequel (Angels And Demons), as I did. Please learn from this reader's mistake. I'm sorry I read Angels and Demons not only because I didn't like it. But because it made me a bit uncertain about whether I want to read Dan Brown's next book -- i.e., which book is the fluke?

As was true in The Last Jihad, The Last Days, its sequel, is filled with exciting, suspenseful non-stop action. The plot is based on Jon Bennett's attempt to implement the Arab-Israeli peace plan, of which he is the chief architect. While reading this book I felt like I was on a treadmill that was out of control -- going faster and faster the longer I stayed on. While character development isn't Rosenberg's strong suit and some of his dialogue is at times a bit corny, these deficiencies are mostly overcome by his ability to create a very suspenseful and realistic plot -- a plot that is all too plausible and one that I hope we only have to deal with in fiction. Once you start The Last Days be prepared to change your plans for the next few days because you won't want to put this book down.

Spanning 90 years, Lorenzo Carcaterra's Gangster provides a stirring perspective on the ways of mobsters and their history; all of which is encased in a fine and moving characterization of the enigmatic Angelo Vestieri and his partner, Pudge. Gangster is a fast-paced saga loaded with richly developed characters and true-to-life dialogue that could only be written by an author who grew up in a neighborhood and with people similar to those portrayed in this book. If you read Carcaterra's excellent book, Sleepers, you'll know what I mean (and if you haven't, you should). While engrossed in the action-packed plot of Gangster, you won't be able to miss the three themes that resonate throughout this talented author's powerful new novel -- love, violence and destiny. If you like books about the Mafia and/or are interested in understanding the psychology of gangsters, Gangster is a book I'd have rated 4 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed and it is one I'd highly recommend to you. It is well worth reading. Enjoy!

In typical Follett fashion, Hornet Flight is a very fast-paced, exciting thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. If you're a 'Follett reader' you'll see that his latest book highlights a common theme in this author's WWII novels that lends them particular emotional resonance -- how, beyond the mass movements of armies, it is often the heroic actions of individuals that influences the direction of war. Moreover, these heroic actions are often initiated by women. Hornet's Flight is filled with interesting and credible characters as well as with many twists and turns (although several of them are somewhat predictable, which kep me from rating it five stars). Hornet Flight, which follows the very exciting Jackdaws, restores Follett to the top of his game as a writer of spy inrigue and WWII suspense. I would highly recommend Hornet Nest. Enjoy!

...and if this title doesn't steer you away from The Ruins, then add boring and disappointing. More painful than reading this book is having to give it such negative review. I couldn't wait for The Ruins to be released after having waited about thirteen years since Scott Smith's first very excellent thriller, A Simple Plan. I loved that book and bought several copies to give to relatives and friends. But, sad to say, Smith has made a complete turnaround with The Ruins; i.e., as good as A Simple Plan was, that's how bad The Ruins is. The Ruins has an interesting premise and it probably would have made a decent short story. However, Smith has stretched this out into a 319 page book --very little of which has dialogue -- by describing every thought and feeling each character has. This served to make The Ruins an extremely slow and tedious read. And while the book has its share of scenes that other reviewers describe as horrific and gory, I found these scenes to be much too few and far between. Further, many of them were predictable. While, as I said, I couldn't wait for Smith to come out with another book after his memorable first book, I am working hard to exorcise The Ruins from my memory. Hopefully, this review will dissuade those of you who feel the need to plunk down their hard-earned money to read Scott Smith's latest book because of the great experience they had with A Simple Plan. Believe me, The Ruins is nowhere close to being in the same league as A Simple Plan! However, as disappointing as The Ruins was to me, I am willing to give Smith the benefit of the doubt and assume that A Simple Plan is the truer example of his talent. And so, I'll probably be one of the first in line for his next book, which hopefully won't take another thirteen years to be written.

Overall, I enjoyed Small Town a lot. It's a very compelling, interesting and somewhat challenging read. In Block's Small Town, New York City in the aftermath of 9/11 is really a small town filled with men and women from all walks of life whose aspirations fears, disappointments and triumphs are all interconnected by bonds as unspeakable as they are unseen. The plot involves a series of apparently unconnected serial killings, which in the warped viewpoint of the Carpenter are intended as "sacrifices" in order to help the city and its dwellers to be reborn out of the chaos and destruction caused by 9/11. Block is at the top of his game in terms of plot development and character development; however, Small Town represents a big departure from what fans of his books have become used to. Small Town is not, as is obvious if you've read the very mixed reviews by other Amazon readers, a book for everyone. Many criticize it for its very graphic and erotic sexual passages as well as for the ending leaving too many threads untied. While I understand how the book could be criticized for these reasons, I, personally, didn't share these opinions. In fact, I think the sexual relationships, while very graphic, were integral to the main story line. And while it's true that some sub-story lines are not as closed as readers expect in a novel, in real life not all stories have a clear, precise ending. As I said, earlier, Small Town is a somewhat challenging read in that you have to really pay attention to some of the small clues Block provides. If you don't, you might find, as I did, that you'll have to go back and reread some areas to understand its connection to the outcome. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding whether Small Town is a book for you -- because it's not for everyone.

Iles' Dead Sleep continues his streak of exciting, well-written, suspenseful novels. While not, in my opinion, as good as Black Cross, Mortal Fear and The Quiet Game, Dead Sleep is very much worth reading. In typical fashion, Iles has developed an imaginative story, multidimensional characters, a very fast-paced plot and non-stop surprises. Unlike James Patterson in his book, First To Die, Iles has created a female protagonist that is very credible, strong and one you grow very fond of and really care about. I came close to giving Dead Sleep a 5-star rating; but didn't because the ending, while enjoyable, was a bit contrived. This, however, is a minor flaw, at most, and should not deter you from reading this book. As a matter of fact, if you haven't already done so, you should read all of Iles' books. While all thrillers, they are all very different from each other. What they have in common is a creator who is extremely talented. In just a few years, Iles has established hinself as an author whose books I make it a point to buy just because he wrote them. What the story is about is almost inconsequential because I have confidence, based on past experience, that it will be a real page-turner. Enjoy!

The Beach House is a book I found to be entertaining, fast-paced, and very difficult to put down; and worthy of a 3 1/2 stars if [it was] allowed such a rating. I'm still trying to figure out why I feel this way overall since the plot, while interesting, is very far-fetched, the characters are superficial, the dialog is often poorly written, the love interest isn't very interesting and the ending is fairly predictable. I find this dichotomy to be characteristic of many of Patterson's books, although The Beach House is better than his other (non-Alex Cross) books. If you're looking for a light read for the beach or when traveling on vacation, one that will hold your attention throughout without making you think too much (if at all), this book should satisfy your needs. However, if you're looking for anything more than an entertaining story, try something else.

The Cabinet Of Curiosities is the best book by these authors since Relic and Reliquary -- and that's high praise since all of Preston's and Child's books have been very good. If you're looking for a top notch &quot;Summer Read,&quot; you'll have a tough time finding a more exciting and entertaining book than this one. Keep in mind, The Cabinet Of Curiousities is not great literature but it is well-written and is a story that will hold your attention from the first to last page. Without going into the plot details, which has been done in many of the previous reviews, this books is very fast-paced, has captivating characters (some of whom you'll recognize if you've read Relic, Reliquary and Thunderhead by these authors), contains lots of interesting historical and science information, and is filled with suspense and surprises. All in all, The Cabinet Of Curiousities is well-worth your time and money. Enjoy! You're in for a fun reading experience.

While I didn't enjoy Koontz's last two books and his new book is not as good as Watchers, Dark Rivers Of The Heart and Intensity, he definitely has a big hit with False Memory.It's filled with very interesting characters and the compelling plot holds your interest right from the beginning. But beyond these vital elements, Koontz's main strength in my opinion in False Memory is his ability to tap into the dark side of society and to demonstate how his main characters prevail. Make sure that when you start this book you've cleared your calendar of all things to do because you won't want to put False Memory down.

It is obvious that David Pietrusza did a tremendous amount of research on Arnold Rothstein and the times in which he lived; and, for the most part, he does a very good job in implementing a huge amount of facts about Rothstein's personal life, his many various criminal activities, his political connections, and his association with a "who's who" of gangsters, gamblers and politicians during the first quarter of the 20th century.If you've ever had a strong interest in learning about the life of Arnold Rothstein, the gambler/gangster who was widely believed to be "The Brain" behind the 1919 Black Sox Scandal and numerous other fixed gambling events, then you're likely to be a big fan of Pietrusza's chronicle of his life titled Rothstein: The Life, Times and Murder of the Criminal Genius Who Fixed the 1919 World Series. I emphasize "strong interest" because this book provides so many details about so many aspects of Rothstein's life, activities and associations that it it could just as easily been titled The Encyclopedia of Arnold Rothstein.Personally, I had the level of interest in Arnold Rothstein life that enabled me to enjoy this book a lot. Be forewarned, however, that readers having less than a "strong interest" are likely to find the depth and breadth of the details provided to be tedious reading, resulting in them being likely to skim through various sections of this book.I hope this review is helpful in deciding if this book is worthy of your time and money.

Double Play is a mixture of historical "faction", baseball and, of course, thriller. It takes place in 1947 when Jackie Robinson is breaking into baseball and Parker's new hero, Burke, is hired by the Dodgers to be his bodyguard. I have not been a huge fan of Robert Parker over the years, but the basic plot of Double Play captured my interest. Having just finished it, I found it to be extremely fast reading, "right on" in capturing the mood of the period in time in which the story takes place, and exciting. While Parker's prose are sparse, his dialogue is very effective and his characters, while not developed quite enough for my taste, are very interesting. Overall, Double Play is well worth reading and can be read in one sitting if you have a few hours to devote to it. I'm looking forward to Parker's next book featuring Burke, and Double Play has made me enough of a Parker fan to now go back and read more of his books.

Due to its close, albneit fictitious, association with the show and its producer (Lorne Michaels), the plot of Saturday Night Dead kept me involved in the story moreso than it would have if it was a straight mystery centered around a made-up TV show. However, while the story holds your interest, it is somewhat contrived and the believabilty of some of the characters requires a big stretch of the imagination -- especially, the main character, Harvey Blissberg, who shortly after retiring as a professional baseball player becomes such an adept private-eye that he's able to solve a murder case that the NYC police department can't begin to get close to solving. All this aside, if you're in the mood for a very fast read and a mystery that holds your attention, you could do a lot worse than reading Saturday Night Dead.

Let me start off by saying that Charleston is an entertaining book -- provided you don't mind a book that is much more focused on telling history than a compelling story with interesting and well-developed characters. If the reverse is &quot;your cup of tea&quot;, Charleston might not be to your taste. I'd suggest his Kent Family Chronicles or his North and South series. Because I have enjoyed all of Jakes's books due to his strong ability to marry historical fact with fiction, Charleston, while good, was somewhat of a letdown for me. In telling the history of Charleston from about 1720 to just past the end of the Civil War, Jakes seems to have gotten off track a bit in regards to what he was trying to do with his story. As a result, I found myself not &quot;knowing&quot; his characters as well as I would have liked and, for the most part, not caring about most of them. Hope this is helpful to you in deciding whether or not to read Charleston. Again, in making your decision please decide carefully if you're okay with a book whose main &quot;character&quot; is the history of a city moreso than the people making up that city.

One False Move is another highly entertaining, witty, mystery from Harlan Coben that -- as usual -- keeps you guessing right to the very end. His main character, Myron Bolitar, and his other characters, particularly Win, are fun to follow as they move from adventure to adventure from one book to the next. To all those non-sports fans, don't be scared away by the fact that Bolitar is a sports agent. The sports aspects only provide the background to how Bolitar gets involved in his adventures. Coben's next book is due out soon and I can't wait!

In Kanar's first book, a medical thriller called The J Factor, he has created an interesting and imaginative plot that will hold your interest. However, there really aren't very many surprises for a book almost 400 pages long and it ends with with some subplots being resolved too abruptly. The suspense would have been more intense if The J Factor was 50-100 pages shorter. Kanar is an author with a lot of potential, and I'm looking forward to his next book. The J Factor is a book that is worth reading but don't rush to put it at the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list.

Every Dead Thing is a good first effort by John Connelly and it had the potential to be great. It has many of the elements loved by lovers of serial killer thrillers -- fast-pacing, murders and gore galore and lots of plot twists. However, my main fault with this book is that Connelly failed to develop his main character and key supporting characters well enough for me to feel that I really knew them and, as a result, I never cared enough about what happened to them. If this had been done more satisfactorily I definitely would have rated Every Dead Thing a &quot;5&quot;. Connelly is an author with lots of potential and I look forward to his next book.

After reading the first half of the book, I felt that it was going to deserve a 5-star rating. This was due to Lindsay's providing a fresh, surprising, fast-paced writing style and a rather unique main character. However, once I became accustomed to the novelty of his style and the wittiness of the character, I realized the story was too passive for a story about serial killers and not as exciting as I thought it would be. Further, with the exception of Dexter, all of the other characters are not very well-developed nor are they particularly interesting. While I wasn't disappointed in Darkly Dreaming Dexter, it is not a book that I'd urge you to rush out to read.

In Masquerade, Lynds' first thriller, she shows some potential and some similarity in style to Robert Ludlum. Overall, however, Masquerade is a book in which I was disappointed and would not recommend. While I am usually willing to suspend belief to a degree in international thrillers, Masquerade just goes out of the stratosphere in this dimension. It's plot, characters and ending are very unbelievable and the dialogue is too corny and unrealistic. On the plus side, Lynds manages to keep the story moving along at a brisk pace and made me want to finish the book to see how it ends. For this reason and her similarity in style to Ludlum, I plan to read at least one of Lynds' more recent works to see if she has grown in her writing skills. Although I did not enjoy Lynds' first attempt as a writer of international thrillers, she demonstates enough potential to warrant a second chance.

The Trench is a big improvement over Alten's first book, &quot;Meg',&quot; which I thought was very poorly written. The Trench is very fast-paced and the many scenes in which the Meg attacks just about anything in sight will make you think twice about going back into the ocean --even if you're in a boat! If you are looking for a book that will hold your attention but make no demands on your intellect, The Trench will be a decent choice. Keep in mind, though, that the writing is just okay, the characters are not particularly well-developed and the dialogue is at times unrealistic. However, the plot moves along at a brisk enough pace that I think you will overlook these deficiencies. Happy reading!

The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced, exciting thriller that will hold your interest from the opening pages to the final page. Brown, in his latest thriller, starts you off with a vicious murder in the Louvre and takes you on a search for the Holy Grail. What makes The Da Vinci Code several levels above the average thriller is Brown's ability to use the impeccable research he did to provide a fascinating interpretation of Western history and to describe historical events that are as interesting as the suspenseful murder investigation itself. I think that if you can put aside whatever your strong personal beliefs are about &quot;the Truth&quot; and not take the book too seriously, you'll consider The Da Vinci Code to be among the most interesting and entertaining novels you've read in a long time. The one flaw in this book for me -- and it's a very minor one -- is that Brown could have been more descriptive about the physical appearances of the hero and heroine to enable you to have good picture in your mind about what they looked like. I highly recommend The Da Vinci Code to you. Enjoy!

Rosenfelt succesfully follows up his first two novels, Open And Shut and First Degree, with Bury The Lead. Rosenfelt has become one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers due to his ability to provide interesting plots, credible courtroom drama, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters. Andy Carpenter, the main character who is a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney, is one that stays in your mind even after you finish the book and is one that I'm looking forward to 'hang out' with in his future legal adventures. Plus, his dog, Tara, is one I wish I had. The only factor that keeps me from giving Bury The Lead a 5-star rating is being able to guess who the murderer is a bit too easily; although figuring out the motive for the murders will, I think, keep you guessing. Despite this very minor criticism I highly recommend Bury The Lead when you're in the mood for a fast-paced, easy read. However, you might want to first consider reading Open And Shut and First Degree, which I think will further your appreciation of Bury The Lead.

While Certain Prey is a fast read, the story is too farfetched to be believable and the characters are not well-developed and are somewhat cartoonish. Given you know the killer(s) early on, there is not as much suspense as I've come to expect from John Sandford, especially from the early Prey books in the series. I'm afraid that Sandford is running out of credible plots and interesting, believable villains, and it might be time for Sandford to consider retiring Lucas Davenport. While I'm not ready to give up on this series, I'm going to need to see a lot of positive reader support before I buy another Sandford book. Bottom line is that Certain Prey is a book that holds your attention but does not live up to expectations.

Raeding Saving Faith is like chewing a good piece of bubble gum. You enjoy it while chewing it but forget about it immediately once you're through with it. Baldacci provides enough action in this political thriller to maintain your interest, although much of the suspense and interplay between the characters is somewhat predictable. While I enjoyed reading Saving Faith, it is certainly not among his best books. However, I don't agree that it is as bad as many of the earlier rewiewers consider it to be. If you're looking for light beach reading that is fast-paced, mildly exciting and will hold your interest, give Saving Faith a try. But if you have not read Baldacci before, I'd suggest you start by reading one of his other books --especially Absolute Power.

I read Hell's Kitchen mainly because Jeffery Deaver wrote it -- and I'm a bit sorry that I did. The plot's concept is fairly interesting, which involves a Hollywood location scout in NYC to film a documentary about the residents of Hell's Kitchen and coming to the aid of an elderly woman accused of having her tenement set on fire. However, Deaver's execution of the plot is somewhat disjointed and implausible, and it moves at too slow a pace. And, while the ending has a fair amount of excitement, it's too litle, too late. Further, I found the characters in Hell's Kitchen to be rather thinly developed, in that they were one-dimensional, somewhat stick-like figures. Although Hell's Kitchen, which was written earlier in Deaver's career under the pseudonym, William Jefferies, is not a BAD book,it is a book I'd advise you to skip. It is easy to understand why it was not published until after Deaver became a "household name."

Parker's Gunman's Rhapsody makes you feel that you've been transported back to 1881 and life in a small western town (Tombstone)-- dealing with gun fights, cowboys and local politics, and working with the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and their women. Since the book is based on historical accounts of the Earps and events leading up to the gunfight at the OK corral, much of the action is not surprising. However, Gunman's Rhapsody's main strength is in its very well-developed characters and its sense of the Wild West that seems so real you constantly feel the need to kick the mud off your boots, and to check your pistol to make sure you're ready for whatever trouble you're going to have to deal with next. If you are hankering for a good novel about an exciting era long past, Gunman's Rhapsody is highly recommended. Louis L'Amour has nothing over Robert Parker in books about the Old West.

The Edgar Award-winning, A Cold Day In Paradise, is a commendable first effort -- good plot, fast-moving, suspenseful, good characterization and interesting narrative. One element I was somewhat disappointed in was the element of &quot;surprise,&quot; as I guessed a large part of the ending about midway through the book. Also, a few story threads were not tied together tightly enough for my satisfaction. Nonetheless, I enjoyed Steve Hamilton's first book a lot and a think you will too.

Eric Van Lustbader wrote this book in the style of Robert Ludlum -- but unfortunately, the style Ludlum wrote in in his later years, in which he used a 'cookie cutter-like' formula. While the story moves along at a quick pace, it is very predictable. The characters are mostly one dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogue is often unrealistic and corny, and the action, while plentiful, provides no real surprises. The Bourne Legacy is good enough to finish, but not good enough start (if you haven't already gone out and bought it). The Bourne Legacy is not a bad book, it's just not a very good one.

The Kidnapping OF Aaron Greene is a book I got as an advance reader copy prior to its publication in 1998. I finally decided to read it after all this time in the hope that the saying "all good things come to those who wait" would prove to be true. Unfortunately, this book did not deliver on my expectations. Bottom line is that while it is okay enough to finish, it is not good enough to recommend.The premise on which Terry Kay based his book was intriguing -- namely, why would anyone kidnap a young man named Aaron Greene, considered to be a nobody by all those who know him, and demand that the bank he works for in its mailroom -- not his parents -- pay $10 million for his return? Then, what would happen if the bank refuses to pay? What was not intriguing -- and, in fact, was very slow-moving and predictable -- was Kay's execution of this premise. This fact, coupled, with a cast of characters that were not very well-developed, resulted in my not caring one way or the other about what happened to Aaron Greene or any of the others.Given that Terry Kay has written some other non-mystery genre books, such as Shadow Song and To Dance With The White Dog, that have been very well-received over the years, I will most likely read at least one of these books in the future. Hopefully, I will enjoy them more than I did The Kidnapping Of Aaron Greene.

After reading all the highly favorable reviews about Loaded Dice, I was anticipating reading a highly entertaining book. Sorry to say, this book, while being a fast read, didn't have much going for to make it recommendable. In my opinion, it is, at best "fair." The plot was very predictable, the dialogue is often unreal and the secondary characters are rather poorly developed. Even the main character -- Tony Valentine -- didn't 'ring true' for me. This was my first book by James Swain and may be my last -- although I have several of the others in this series. I know issuing a critical review on Amazon often results in many negative ratings. I'm willing to risk this if it helps prevent you from making the same mistake I did, which was reading a book that was disappointing.

After reading the favorable reviews on Amazon and the book's interesting jacket cover, as well as being a big fan of WWII thrillers in general, I couldn't wait to start Double Cross Blind. However, after plodding through almost half of this book, I had to give up on it. I found the author's style of wriitng to be pedestrian, his dialog to be unreralistic and his main and minor characters to be thiny developed and basically unlikable. I could have accepted these limitations if the story line was captivating, which was not the case. As a result, I felt that I was the victim of a double cross blind. I hope you don't make the same mistake I made by plunking your money down for this book that seems like it has all the makings of a non-stop, thrilling reading experience. Perhaps if I was able to make it through the second half of the book, it would have made up for all the faults I had with it in the first half -- but I felt there was about as much chance of this happening as seeing snow in August.

As the former head of a major advertising agency, James Patterson mastered the art of developing advertising to help successfully brand his clent's products and he hit upon a strategy that carried this art into his fiction writing. The formula he uses in his books has enabled him to become an industry unto himself. Cross is better than Patterson's recent books, but it is still light years away from the quality of his early books. Cross's strength is that it holds your interest and is a very fast read. If that is enough for you, then you'll probably enjoy Cross. It is not a bad book. It's just one that is very shallow in terms of plot and character development, and very predictable. For me, reading Cross was like chewing a piece of bubble gum. It satisfied a very basic craving for a brief period, and then was totally forgettable once I finished it. I hope this review has given you a perspective of what the experience of reading Cross might be like.

Dennis Lehane's psychological thriller, Mystic River is his best book to-date, which is quite a compliment given that each of his five previous books were very, very good. In my opinion, Lehane is now the king of the mystery thriller genre. Mystic River is much more than a well-told story. It is a masterpiece of passionate narrative and deeply moving characterizations. In Mystic River Lehane tells a great story of love, loyalty, faith and family, in which three former childhood friends find themselves in adult life on an unalterable crash course with the dark truths of their own pysches. I highly recommend that you get a copy of Mystic River as soon as possible and move it immediately to the top of your to-be-read list.

I was really looking forward to reading this book after having read many of the glowing reviews. While Jim Fusilli is an author with potential I was largely disappointed in Closing Time, his first effort. The basic premise is interesting and Fusilli's descriptive abilities of the sights and sounds of New York strongly ring true. However, the plot is too drawn out and Fusilli seems unable to forego describing all the thoughts and feelings of his main character, Terry Orr. By the time I got through the first quarter of Closing Time (about 75 pages), I was spending as much time thinking about what to read next as on the story itself. Closing Time is not a bad book, it's just not an especially good one. If you're into reading the first works of authors with promise, than Closing Time might be worth your time -- but buy in paperback, or better still, get it from the library. Otherwise, since there are so many books and so little time, I'd suggest you skip this book.

David L. Robbins can flat-out write! Why he is not better known and does not have a larger following is even more of a mystery to me than the excellent mystery he has written in Scorched Earth. Scorched Earth is a story of crime and punishment in a small town in Virginia that is part mystery and part legal thriller. If you like Scott Turow's books you'll love Scorched Earth, as it surpasses the best of his efforts. Robbins' narrative and descriptive powers lay bare the potential of the human heart to hate and, eventually, to heal. While not a fast-moving book, Robbins has developed such strong, powerful and realistic characters that you feel every emotion each character experiences, which range the gamut from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. In many ways, Scorched Earth reminds me of another excellent book, Mystic River by Dennis Lehane. But Robbins goes well beyond introducing you to a range of deeply moving characters, his plot will keep you guessing right until the very end -- even though you'll probably think, as I did, that you 'know who did what to who' half way through the book. I highly recommend Scorched Earth to you when you are in the mood for a very well-written, realistic, at times gut-wrenching mystery that will touch you on many levels. Be warned, though, that this is not the book to sit down with if you're in the mood for a fast-read, "mind candy" type of book. Enjoy!

Flowers From Berlin, at almost 600 pages, kept me turning the pages at a very fast pace. Set against a background of international upheaval, Hynd weaves an interesting plot of sabotage, intrigue, murder and an attempt to assassinate FDR by a professional killer and the Third Reich. Hynd's plot and characters are well-developed, his dialogue is true to the period, his historical facts are presented in a interesting manner and he provides sufficient tension to make you read on and on and on until you find out what happens next. In many ways, Hynd writes in the tradition of Ken Follett and Frederick Forsyth -- but not quite as good. Two factors keep me from giving this book a 5-star rating. One is that it would have been more exciting if it was about 100 pages shorter; and the second is that the killer's identity is fairly predictable. Nonetheless, if you like suspense thrillers that take place about the time of WWII, Flowers From Berlin is a book I think you'd enjoy. I've had this book in my personal library since 1987 before I just got around to reading it. It won't take me anywhere near that long to read the rest of the books I have by this talented author.

Sacred is another terrific mystery in the series featuring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, the team you'd want on your side if you needed a private investigation -- if only they were real people. Lehane describes these characters in such realistic detail and uses such crisp dialogue that you forget that they are only fictional characters. Nonetheless, they are characters you want to get to know better, and Lehane successfully evolves the personalities of Patrick and Angie in each of the five books in the series. Thus, it's best if you read the series in chronological order. Sacred is very fast-paced and loaded with surprising plot twists, which forces you to read on non-stop. While you can see I am very high on Sacred, it -- believe it or not -- is not the best book in the series. Of the four I've read so far, I enjoyed Darkness, Take My Hand and Gone, Baby Gone even more. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to all of Lehane's books.

Nelson DeMille has been one of my favorite authors since his first book, By The Rivers Of Babylon. With his latest effort, Night Fall, DeMille lives up to his well-deserved reputation as a "must read" author. The basic plot of Night Fall involves an investigation and an alternative conclusion to the official government decision that the crash of TWA flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, NY was something other than an accident. Demille's main character, John Corey, ex-NYPD detective and current member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force, is as irreverent and interesting as they come in fiction today. This is Demille's third, and best, book featuring John Corey; the other two being Plum Island and The Lion's Game. In many ways he reminds me of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch character. Besides Corey, DeMille has created many other well-developed characters that help to keep the suspense and excitement moving at a brisk pace. While some other reviewers found the ending to be contrived, I, on the other hand considered it to be quite fitting (although somewhat predictable). If you're looking for a book that is well-written, very-fast-paced, suspenseful and presents a highly interesting "what if" scenario, Night Fall is a book you shouldn't miss. As you can tell, I have a very favorable opinion of Night Fall. However, Night Fall is not among the best of the best of DeMille's books. My favorite DeMille books -- in rank order -- are Word Of Honor, Gold Coast and Charm School. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy of Night Fall (as well as any of DeMille's books).

For awhile now I have been successfully weaning myself off of James Patterson's books. As the former head of a major advertising agency, he mastered the art of developing advertising to help successfully brand his clent's products and he hit upon a strategy that carried this art into his fiction writing. The formula he uses in his books has enabled him to become an industry unto himself. However, with his last several books, and particularly in Honeymoon, he's turned his industry into the mass production of shlock. I decided to buy Honeymoon because of the book's co-author, Howard Roughan, whose two books (The Up And Comer and The Promise Of A Lie) are excellent. Unfortunately, in this joint effort, Roughan sunk to Patterson's level in terms of quality, rather Patterson rising to Roughan's. Honeymoon's strength is that it holds your interest and is a very fast read. If that is enough for you, then you'll probably enjoy Honeymoon. It is not a terrible book. It's just one that is very shallow in terms of plot and character development, and very predictable. Reading Honeymoon is like chewing a piece of bubble gum. It satisfies a very basic craving for a brief period, and then is totally forgettable once you are finished with it. There are so many better books than Honeymoon in this genre that my strong recommendation is to not waste your time and money on this Patterson-Roughan effort. As mentioned, if you like Patterson's style of writing, I think you'll derive a lot more pleasure from reading the two stand-alone books by Howard Roughan. As for me, I think Honeymoon has finally cured me of my habit of buying any more books by "Crank-em-out" Patterson.

Brimstone is a very fast-paced, suspenseful, enjoyable read, but not as good as Relic, Reliquary and The Cabinet Of Curiousities. Nonetheless, Brimstone which reunites FBI Agent Prendergast and former NYPD cop Vincent D'Agosta will grab your attention within the first few pages and not let go until the very last page. Preston and Childs have developed a unique plot in which Prendergast and D'Agosta are involved in trying to solve some murders that are devilsh in nature, or so it seems. In typical Preston/Child fashion, the authors blend science, technology, the supernatural and history in such a way that the result is a highly readble, suspenseful story. My only criticisms, albeit minor, are that the ending is too open-ended paving the way for the authors' next book), and that Prendergast, while an entertaining, memorable character is (for this reader) stretching the limits of credibility. He makes James Bond seem like an amateur. If you have a long flight or vacation coming up, Brimstone is a book that will provide pure escapism and leave you satisfied.

I've read all of David Baldacci's books, although in my opinion each new book is a little less good than the one preceding it. And, having read Hour Game, I may be ready to give up on Baldacci -- or, at leat no longer consider him to be one of my 'must read' authors. The Hour Game starts off with a lot of promise, interesting plot and lots of mystery and excitement. However, the book never lived up to its potential. The plot became too muddled and confusing, too many characters were involved and the interval between anything exciting happening was much too drawn out. While Baldacci's latest is just good enough to finish, it's not a book I'd recommend highly to you.

Rubenfeld's fictional debut, The Interpretation Of Murder, is an excellent historical thriller that features Sigmund Freud and a cast of well-developed characters, one of which is a killer that attacks some wealthy Manhattan heiresses during Freud's only visit to the U.S. in 1909. Rubenfeld's writing style will have your fingers flying through the pages, and he successfully blends several elements that contribute to The Interpretation Of Murder living up to the considerable pre-publication praise it garnered -- i.e., classic crime, historical characters, a feel-like-you're-there snapshot of NYC in 1909, Shakespearean puuzles and psychological mysteries. This is a book that succeeds on various levels and is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in quite awhile. Do yourself a big favor and put The Interpetation Of Murder at the top of your reading list. Enjoy!

I've enjoyed all of Joseph Finder's books but Paranoia is unquestionably his best! The plot is very fast-paced, the characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional and the suspense involving corporate spying is non-stop. If this isn't enough to make you want to rush right out to get a copy of this compelling thriller, be aware that Finder provides twists and turns that will keep you intrigued and surprised right up to the very end. Be prepared for a very exciting and fun reading experience. Paranoia will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. It is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in quite awhle. Paranoia deserves to be at the top of the bestseller lists and it should help Joseph Finder become one of the elite group of today's popular writers.

After reading all of Wiltse's previous books--each of which I would rate between 8-10--Blown Away is a major disappointment and should be Thrown Away. Unlike the previous Becker books, Wiltse provides has provided little depth to his plot and to his character development. It may be that Wiltse's &quot;well has run dry&quot; when it comes to stories featuring John Becker.

Beulah Hill involves a racially motivated murder in a Vermont town in 1933 and the ramifications it has on the backwoods community. This premise is interestng and Heffernan succeeds pretty well in creating some believable characters and setting the right mood and tone of the area and time in which the story takes place. Overall, however, I felt the story dragged on too long after the initial murder occurred and the not very surprising conclusion was reached. I think Beulah Hill would have made an excellent short story, but as a novel, it is just an okay read. If you decide to read Beulah Hill I don't think you'll be dissatisfied. However, I also think you'll find that your time would have been better spent reading something else.

Having enjoyed Salinger's, White Darkness, very much, I was very disappointed in this author's first book, Behold The Fire. While the basic plot was okay, Salinger's characters were too shallow and poorly developed, his writing style was too disjointed and after a while I found myself not caring at all about what was to happen next. My main goal became to just finish this book, which was a struggle. While I, obviously, don't recommend Behold The Fire to you, I would highly recommend White Darkness by Salinger. It not only has a well-developed plot and interesting characters, it clearly demonstrates Salinger's improvement as a writer.

The Informant demands your attention from the very beginning and doesn't let up until the very end. The basic plot involves the twists and turns of an FBI hunt for a serial killer, as well as of a reporter covering the case who gets anonymous phone calls from a person who claims to be able to predict the time, place and victim of the next slaying. It's an exciting, action-filled, fun book but its comparison to The Silence Of The Lambs is, in my opinion, giving it too much credit. What keeps me from giving The Informant a 5-star rating is that I found it somewhat easy to guess who the informant is and there were some pretty far-fetched coincidences that stretched my limit of credibility. Nonetheless, The Informant is well worth reading. I'm looking forward to reading other books by James Grippando. Enjoy!

In The Closers Detective Harry Bosch is back with the LAPD working on trying to close unsolved cases. On his first case back on the force he is attempting to solve the death of a teenaged girl from almost two decades ago. Connelly's above average writing skills makes The Closers an entertaining read. However, in contrast to many of Connelly's other books, The Closers has fewer surprises, a lot less action and is notably more predictable in regards to guessing the outcome. If you are a fan of Connelly's and his Harry Bosch character, I think you'll find The Closers to be a satisfying read. However, if this is your first Harry Bosch mystery I don't think reading this book will motivate you to want to rush out to read other books in the series. In my opinion this would be a mistake since most of the other Harry Bosch mysyeries are very good-to-excellent.

Resurrection Day, as most books by Glenn Meade are very, fast-paced, packed with tension and excitement and filled with interesting characters. Resurrection Day was written shortly before 9-11 and is based on the President of the US being threatened with mass destruction of Washington, DC by a bin Laden-type al-Qaeda terrorist unless he gives in to his demands. Despite its intimidating length (740 pages) and small print, Resurrection Day will keep you glued to the edge of your chair and will make you stop and think how this author was able to foresee the horrible attack in the US so accurately. The one problem you'll have is trying to obtain a copy of this book, as it doesn't seem to be available in bookstores or libraries. It is available on Amazon and other online booksellers. If you like edge-of-the-seat thrillers, it will be worth your effort to try to obtain a copy.

To-date it seems that Greg Iles is incapable of writing a bad book. With that said, Turning Angel, while being a page-turner, is far from being among Iles' best. The basic plot and main character (Penn Cage from The Quiet Game) are interesting and well-developed. The plot revolves around Cage being asked by his oldest friend to help defend him after being accused of raping and murdering a beautiful high school girl. However, at about 500 pages, Turning Angel is bloated with excessive dialog (which, at times, seems that the reader is being preached to) and repetitive descriptive passages (for example, within the first 100-200 pages Iles repeats the phrase "when I was an assistant district attorney in Houston" way too many times). He should know that readers of his complex novels have a fair amount of intelligence and don't need to be reminded of some facts ad nauseum). Morever, other than the main character, some of his secondary characters lack credibility; in particular, Mia, an 18-year old high school senior who babysits for Cage's child and is helping him solve the case. Granted high school kids are more advanced about some things than when I was in high school, the degree of worldliness and sophistication exuded by this small town (i.e., Natchez, Mississippi) teenager requires the imagination to be stretched much too far for her to be believable. Further, much of the action involving drug dealing, gun fights, etc. doesn't take place until the last 50-100 pages; which, for me, was too little too late. Turning Angel was good enough to hold my attention and was worth reading. However, I wouldn't recommend that you rush out and add it to your 'must read' list. Although Turning Angel isn't his best book, Iles still remains one of my favorite authors and, as usual, I'll be one of the first of his fans to buy his next book. I'm hoping, however, the next book will be a true stand-alone and not a follow up to this book.

The Job had me hooked throughout most of the story. During the course of about 80%-90% of the book I found the story to be very interesting and believable (although somewhat predictable), the characters to be credible and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. However, while Kennedy managed to maintain the fast pace to the very end, during the last 10%-20% of The Job the plot and the behavior of the key characters lost much of its credibility--thus reducing my overall evaluation from an excellent book to just a good book.

No, this is not a review of Shakespeare's play. Having read the very positive reviews of Speak of the Devil by Richard Hawke (actually Tim Cockey), I was expecting to read an exciting, suspenseful mystery written in the style of some of my favorite authors in this genre (e.g., Harlan Coben, Nelson DeMille, Joseph Finder, David Rosenfelt, etc.). Unfortunately, to me, these favorable reviews were much ado about nothing. While the first third of the book was effective in fulfilling my high expectations, the remainder was disappointing. The plot was interesting enough and moved along at a brisk pace, although you really have to stretch your imagination for it to be plausible. My main problem is that I found Hawke's ability to develop credible characters and dialogue to be sub-par, especially relative to the authors to which he is compared in some of the other reviews posted on Amazon. The dialogue Hawke creates for his characters is much too glib to be credible and the characters themselves are too loosely developed and somewhat 'stick-like" to make them memorable and believable. Hawke works much too hard to make his main NYC characters appear "with it" and sophisticated in the "ways of the world." I've lived in and around NYC my whole life and have yet to meet anyone who comes close to the characters portrayed in this book. Further, I found the more secondary characters to be so thinly developed -- and especially the "bad guys, about whom I felt I never really got a clear picture of in my mind about what they looked like or what there motivations were -- that I couldn't care less about what happened to them. Perhaps if I read Speak of the Devil without having first read all of the high praise it received, I might not have felt as let down. Be that as it may, Speak of the Devil is good enough to finish, but not good enough to recommend highly. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding on whether or not to read the book.

Lacey's biography is an interesting, relatively faced-paced read; although the sub-title for this book is a bit misleading. Little Man provides an interesting perspective on Meyer Lansky as a man and as a "family man." However, the book is pretty thin on describing Lansky's exploits as a gangster and about the "gangster life." This perhaps isn't too surprising since a major source for the information Lacey provides was Lansky's family members, and particularly his son Buddy, who worshipped him. Overall, I found the family perspective on Meyer Lansky provided me with a lot of new insight into the character of the man. This book served to comlement what I learned from reading other bios on Lansky that delved much more deeply into Lansky, the gangster. One big point of difference between this book and others about Lansky pertains to the amount of money he was worth at the time of his death. While according to Lacey, Lansky had lost almost all of his money in his later years and had to live quite frugally, other books claim that Lansky left a fortune of about $300 million. Whatever he was worth really isn't important to me. What I hope will be important to you is that Little Man is a worthwhile book to read.

While the plot is interesting, Kellerman allowed the story to drag along at much too slow a pace for very long passages to hold my interest.After reading over one-half of Survival Of The Fittest, I skipped to the ending as I could't take the poor pacing any longer. I guess one might say I wasn't fit enough to survive this slow-moving story.

While I enjoyed The Haunted Air (as I have most of Wilson's books), it is far from the best in the series and nowhere near as good as The Tomb. Perhaps after reading so many superlative reader reviews here, I was expecting much more than what I got. The Haunted Air is a fast-paced, entertaining book that is a good choice as a beach read or long plane trip, and Repairman Jack is - well - just Jack. Enough said about that. However, most of the other characters are thinly developed and the plot lacks the level of excitement, surprises and suspense that I've come to expect from this series, and particularly from these reviews. All in all, if you don't go into reading this book with very high expectations, as I did, and can be satisified with an entertaining story, I think you'll enjoy it.

Dead Center, Rosenfelt's fourth novel in his series featuring Andy Carpenter and his faithful canine companion, Tara, does not come off as as close to being "dead center" as the three preceding books, but it is very enjoyable and definitely worth reading. Rosenfelt continues to be one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers due to his ability to provide interesting plots, plenty of surprises, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters. Andy Carpenter, the main character who is a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney, is one that stays in your mind even after you finish the book and is one that I'm looking forward to 'hang out' with in his future legal adventures. Plus, his dog, Tara, is one I wish I had. I think the main reason I didn't enjoy Dead Center quite as much as Rosenfelt's other books is that it didn't show off Carpenter's courtroom abilities as much. Noneteheless,I recommend Dead Center when you're in the mood for a fast-paced, easy read. However, you might want to first consider reading the other books in the series which I think will further your appreciation of Dead Center.

In Everybody Dies Lawrence Block provides lots of action but the plot tends to ramble at times, is somewhat disjointed, and is fairly predictible. Overall, Everbody Dies will maintain your interest, although it is not a book that will keep you glued to your seat. Further, it is not in quite the same class as many of the earlier Scudder books -- e.g. When The Sacred Ginmill Closes, A Dance At The Slaughterhouse, and Sins Of The Fathers. Like some other reviewers, I'm starting to be concerned that Block is losing some of his edge in this series. Scudder continues to be one of my favorite fictional characters and I'll remain a loyal reader of this series with the hope that Block will return to his earlier form.

The Traitor has an interesting plot -- A British secret agent is captured by the Nazis and, in a decision some considered to be treason, acts out of love and strikes a bargain with his captors. The deal is that in return for his wife who is interned in a concentration camp, the agent agrees to lead a clandestine unit of the SS called the British Free Corps. However, while the author has created an interesting premise and credible characters, the plot didn't move along at a brisk enough pace and the amount of action was somewhat limited for my taste. Further, Walters got too bogged down in describing the motivations for what seemed like every move and thought of the main character. All in all, I'd rate The Traitor as "fair." It is not a bad book; it's just not a book I'd recommend that you rush out to read.

The Brethren is a perfect example of a book that becomes a megaseller just because of its author's mega reputation. While it moves along quickly (Thank God! ), The Brethren is weak in just about every quality you want in a thriller -- plot, characterizations, suspense, surprises, credibility, etc. This book is one more recent example of Grisham's spewing out books without caring enough about the quality on which he built his reputation. Since he's become a dynasty in the publishing world, he seems to have forgotten about the need to satisfy his readers. While it won't amount to a &quot;spit in the ocean&quot; to Grisham, his future fortunes are going to have to be made without any more contributions from me. This is likely to be my last John Grisham book.

As he did so well in his Civil War trilogy and Kent Family Chronicles series, in On Secret Service John Jakes provides a very fast-paced story while blending in lots of interesting and little known facts about the Civil War and the role of the secret service. Also typical of his other works, Jakes provides such vivid descripions of his &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; characters (both real-life and fictional) and of the historical period that I felt that I was right there observing these people and events -- rather than just a reader of a vey good book.On Secret Service has something for all readers -- lots of action, lots of interesting facts about the period before, during and immediately after the Civil War, well-developed characters, and romance. It is a book that I think you will enjoy very much. Actually, if the Amazon rating system allowed it, I would have given On Secret Service 4 1/2 stars. Enjoy!

Criminal attorney Charley Sloan is a very, strong, well-developed character, and Death Penalty has so many interesting goings-on that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what will happen next. My attention was held from the first to last page. Coughlin nicely ties together all of the subplots, although some are somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Death Penalty is well-worth reading, as are each of the other books featuring Charley Sloan.

If you're in the mood for a book that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat from beginning to end, do yourself a favor and read Boris Starling's latest thriller, Storm. If possible, I would have awarded this book 4 1/2 stars.Only the fact that I felt the very end was a little weaker than the rest of the book kept me from giving it a 5 star rating. Putting this very minor detail aside, Storm has it all -- a slam-bang plot, lots of surprises,and very interesting characters. As good as Storm is, however, it's not as good as Starling's first book, Messiah; which I thought was great. If you haven't read Messiah, do so fast. As a matter of fact, you might want to read Messiah even before reading Storm. Enjoy!

When I started reading The Lions Of Lucerne, the first of Brad Thor's series featuring Secret Service Agent, Scot Horvath, I thought I was in for a real exciting reading experience. However, shortly thereafter my high expectations rapidly deteriorated. Reading this book became the equivalent of reading an action comic book, with the hero being a combination of an indestructible superman and a one-man army. Horvath's main character (and secondary characters) lost all credibilty for me to the point that I'm not sure if I want to read any of Thor's other books in this series (even though I own these books). Beyond Thor's weakness in character development, his dialogue is often cliched and, perhaps most annoying, is that the plot moves at too slow a pace throughout much of the book and is very predictible. Do yourself a favor and don't bother reading The Lions Of Lucerne.

Having enjoyed Every Dead Thing as well as The White Road, I was somewhat disappointed in this sequel to Every Dead Thing. The characters were not particularly interesting nor especially well developed. Further, while Dark Hollow provides more than the average amount of action in a thriller, my overall feeling was that I didn't care enough about most of the characters to care one way or the other about what happens to them. Further, the action scenes were somewhat predictable. Unlike my two previous positive experiences with Connolly's books -- which stood out from the pack for their rich imagery and complex and interesting plotting, Dark Hollow didn't work for me.

The Tower, the debut novel by Gregg Andrew Hurwitz, conceptually has all of the elements a good thriller should have; however, it falls short on delivery. The characters are not well developed and are unlikable, and the ending was not very surprising and satisfying. I found myself disliking the hero, Jake Marlow, almost as much as the psychotic killer, Allander Atlasia. As a matter of fact, there wasn't one character I cared about enough to be concerned about what happened to them. The main challenge for me was not to figure out what happens next, but to finish the book as quickly as possible so I can move on to my next book. Hurwitz demonstrates considerable potential to create excitement and suspense; although his ability to sustain this suspense was, all too often, lacking. The Tower is not a bad book. It was good enough to finish but not good enough to recommend -- unless you have an interest in reading a first book by an author who has gone on to receive some very positive acclaim for his subsequent books.

It's hard to believe that Shadow Man is Cody McFadyen's first thriller. His characters are very credible and multidimensional, the descriptive passages are vivid and graphic, the dialog is real and -- oh yeah -- the plot moves along at a brisk pace and is filled with action and surprises. With Shadow Man, Mcfadyen ranks right up there with the best of today's thriller writers. I am anxious to see if he can maintain this lofty level with his soon to be released new book, The Face Of Death. I, for one, plan to be one of the first to buy it to find out.

All of Harlan Coben's books have been excellent but he has far-surpassed himself in his latest, Gone For Good. Be prepared that when you sit down to start this book you won't want to get up until you finish it. It's one of those books that you don't want to stop reading and, at the same time, never want to end. Gone For Good is a rollercoaster of suspense and a tale of haunting love. Coben's skills in plot and character development, narration, and creating credible, edge-of-the seat suspense keep getting better and better. After reading Tell No One, I wondered if Coben had reached the top of his abilities. While there are some similarities in these two books, Gone For Good is by far Coben's best work to date. Now, I'm wondering again if he's reached his zenith. But, when his next book comes out, I'll be one of the first on line to find out.Without going into detail, Gone For Good is about Will Klein's discovery after eleven years that his older brother, who was accused of murdering the girl Will had loved and disappeared afterwards, may not be &quot;gone for good.&quot; To quote the jacket cover, &quot;In Gone For Good, Harlan Coben has written one of those rare thrillers that will not only make the pulse pound, but stir the heart as well.&quot;Now, rush out and get a copy of Gone For Good and have an immensely enjoyable reading experience!

A Long Day For Dying is a perfect book to read on the beach or on a plane trip. It's very plot-driven, fast-paced and exciting. However, you really must be willing to stretch your ability to suspend belief, as the plot is somewhat far-fetched. Also, the book is a little thin on character development. While I enjoyed Davis' latest, it's not a book that will make you feel that you have to rush out and buy his other books. It's fast entertainment that will make you want to &quot;turn the pages,&quot; but it's also the type of book that you'll forget about soon after finishing it.

...how bad this book is. I've been a thriller lover most of my life, and am usually pretty forgiving of minor flaws as long as the story is good. Unfortunately, this book is one of those rare exceptions. The plot is very weak and extremely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard figures, uninteresting and poorly developed. The only reason I kept reading it was because of the mostly favorable reviews posted here and I figured the book HAD to get better. The only real mystery involved with The Next President is where was Joseph Flynn's editor and why was it published. The only thrill for me was when I finally came to the end. I know some of you reading this negative review will be skeptical of it since it is in the minority of reviews to date. However, I don't want to see you waste your time and money -- as I did.

In Daniel Silva's latest thriller, The Kill Artist, he not only continues the suspense created in The Mark Of The Assasin, he exceeds it. This book can't miss being a sure-fire smash with all readers who like international espionage thrillers; and it will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. Silva's writing style is so &quot;grabbing&quot; it will make you feel that you're personally there in the middle of the action. The action is non-stop, the plot is excitng and includes several surprises, and the characters are so fully developed, you'll think you really know them. If you're looking for a book in which you can fully &quot;get lost&quot;, get yourself a copy of The Kill Artist as soon as you can.

The Berlin Conspiracy is Tom Gabbay's debut Cold War thriller that takes place in Berlin in 1963 just prior to, during and shortly after JFK's historic visit at the Berlin Wall.The Berlin Conspiracy's plot focuses on Jack Teller, an ex-CIA operative hoping to live a quiet life on a remote beach in south Florida. His peaceful life is interrupted when he is asked to come to Berlin by the CIA's station chief there as a result of a mysterious message received from a Colonel in the East German Stasi. A message whose content will only be disclosed to Jack Teller. If true, the intelligence provided by the Stasi official exposes a plot originating from the higest levels of the U.S. government. From this point on, the story is a search for what is true or not; and if true, who is behind it and how it can be stopped. Without stating here what the treacherous plot is, it won't be hard for readers to figure out; and, once they do, the book's surprise factor gets somewhat watered down.For a first-time novelist, Gabbay does a good job in creating an interesting and, for the most part, exciting story. For me, however, Gabbay spent too much time -- over one-third of the book --getting his story out of first gear. Further, although Jack Teller is a likeable and interesting enough character, Gabbay does just an acceptable job in making this reader feel that Teller is a character I'd like to see featured in future books. Further, while several of Gabbay's more secondary characters are serviceable enough to keep the story moving along at a decent pace, they are not particularly well-developed and come across as largely one-dimensional.Despite what, to me, are the book's flaws, The Berlin Conspiracy is a fun read and Gabbay is an author with a good amount of potential.

Action is a story of Hollywood and movie-making told through three generations of the Jastrow family. Cort tells his story in an entertaining, fast-moving style and weaves in many real-life, well-known figures (e.g. Steve McQueen, Romy Schneider, Sam Kinnison,etc.), which creates interest. While the book starts off strong, I found my interest consistently declining as the story moved through &quot;the years.&quot; Although I was never bored with the story, by the time I finished Action my main reaction was &quot;So what!&quot; If you have an interest in books about Hollywood and movie-making, you'll probably find Action to be &quot;up your alley.&quot; However, if you are considering reading this book because of a desire for a good, compelling plot, I think you should look elsewhere.

The last fifty pages or so of James Siegel's first book were very exciting but I almost gave up on this book several times because it was too slow moving and took Siegel much too long to develop his plot. In addition, his senior citizen characters, while not uninteresting, were a bit too stereotypical. I gave Epitaph a three star rating not because of the quality of the book per se (which only deserves a 2-2 1/2 star rating), but because of the potential Siegel demonstrated as a writer of exciting fiction. This potential has been more than lived up to in Siegel's newest book, called Derailed. Derailed is one of the best thrillers I've read in quite awhile, and is a book I'd highly recommend to you. As for recommending Epitaph, I'd say read Derailed first (like I did) and than decide if you want to read his first book to see how far he's progressed from his first effort. If after reading Derailed, you decide you didn't like it, than my recommendation would be to skip Epitaph. Even if you do decide to read Epitaph, I'd recommend you borrow it from the library.

Par for the course with a Michael Plamer book, Miracle Cure will keep you reading. However, what is also becoming all too true is that Miracle Cure is another in the line of books written based on the &quot;Palmer formula&quot;. If this is your first book by Palmer, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. But, having read all of Palmer's books,which have now become all to similar in terms of plot development and solution, I was pretty much able to guess the ending of Miracle Cure well in advance of getting there. While I enjoyed reading Miracle Cure, it is too predictable if you are an expereinced reader of Palmer's books.

In Sheldon Shapiro's first novel, Special Circumstances, he deserves to be placed in the top-tier of legal thriller writers. Siegel has created well-developed characters -- particularly his protagonist, Mike Daley -- and the plot is fast-paced and bristles with energy. Siegel's ability to combine excitement, surprises, humor and suspense makes Special Circumstances a book that you won't want to put down. Without going into detail for fear of providing information which might weaken some of the story's suspense for you, the only thing that kept me from rating this book a '5' is that I felt slightly--and I emphasize 'slightly'-- disappointed in the ending. Nevertheless, Special Circumstances is a book I know you'll enjoy and will want to recommend to your friends.

While I don't read a lot of non-fiction, Flags Of Our Fathers is a book that was difficult for me to put down. The author's ability to describe in such a poignant and haunting manner the lives of the six men attributed with raising the flag on Iwo Jima before, during and after the event left me spellbound. Further, it made me once again appreciate a generation of Americans that Tom Brokaw refers to as the "greatest generation." Flags Of Our Fathers should be read by all Americans, and especially the younger generations, who have an interest in understanding the terror of war and the impact it has on those lucky enough to survive it.

Demolition Angel is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of this dark thriller. As to the plot, Crais demonstrates his ability to introduce bombshell after bombshell that, at least figuratively, will &quot;blow you away.&quot; Crais also creates very strong, credible and interesting characters. Carol Starkey, the main character, while not always very likable, is one of the more powerful and multi-dimensional female protagonists I've come across in quite some time. In many ways she reminds me of Clarice Starling. Further, I guarantee you won't be able to forget &quot;Mr. Red.&quot; While I rated Demolition Angel 4 stars, I would have liked to be able to give it 4 1/2 stars. It just falls short of a 5-star rating, due to its dragging very slightly in some sections. Demolition Angel is one of the better thrillers I've read in at least the past six months, and is one I'd definitely recommend that you include near the top of your reading list. Enjoy!

Michael Palmer's ninth medical thriller is well-worth reading. Its plot, which thrusts a gifted neurosurgeon into a world of escalating danger and violence, is loaded with twists and turns and will keep you glued to your seat. Further, the characters are mostly well-developed and interesting. While The Patient is at times predictable and its ending is somewhat implausible, it nevertheless is a fun read and a real page-turner. The Patient is higjly recommended when you're in the mood for a book that is pure escapism. It's a highly charged thriller that will keep the pages flying through your fingers.

While his last several books were mediocre at best, Follett returns to classic form with Jackdaws. Though not as good as Eye Of The Needle or The Key To Rebecca, Jackdaws is Follett's best book in many years. The tension constantly builds and the action is non-stop. For pure suspense-reading, Jackdaws will have you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. However, Jackdaws falls short of deserving a 5-star rating from me because, with the exception of Flick and Dieter Franck, many of his characters served as &quot;tools&quot; to tell this action-packed WWII thriller and were not developed well enough to truly care (one way or the other) about. While I thought this criticism would be important for you to know, I would highly recommend Jackdaws if you're in the mood for a novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of WWII.

The Piper's Sons is a good psychological thriller by first-time author Bruce Chandler Fergusson. Actually, I would have rated this book &quot;3 1/2&quot; stars if Amazon allowed for such a rating. His debut novel provides a good writing style, a well-developed plot and a variety of surprises. However, I found the story dragged on for some long stretches which, at times, caused my interest level to wane. Further, while he spent sufficient time developing the major and minor characters, I found myself not caring as much about them as the author would have wanted me to. Also, I felt that Fergusson tried to weave too many elements into the story which I, at times, found to be confusing and which he never completely tied together at the end. Perhaps he's left the door opened for a sequel. Despite these minor criticisms The Piper's Sons is worth reading and Fergusson is an author with a lot of potential.

Without going into the details of the plot, Follet's latest thriller has an exciting beginning and has interesting and well-developed characters. Overall, Code To Zero is a fast and enjoyable &quot;read&quot;. However, its suspense gradually wanes and the so-called &quot;surprises&quot; and eventual outcome become somewhat predictable. Further, you might feel that you have to suspend belief more than you are willing to in regards to the ease with which the main character: 1) discovers who he is and what he does after learning he has amnesia; and 2) uncovers the plot to sabotage the U.S.'s launching of its Explorer I satellite.Code To Zero, despite its limitations, is worth reading but I'd suggest you take it from the library. There are better books on which to plunk down $26.95.

I have several James Lee Burke books in my home library but White Doves at Morning was the first that I've read. Burke succeeds strongly in creating the atmosphere of the South prior to, during and after the Civil War, as well as in developing rich, multi-dimensional characters. Where the book let me down somewhat, however, was in the area of plot development. While the plot starts off interesting and holds your attention, it drags on for much too long a time. The paperback edition I read at 434 pages would have been much more exciting for me if it was 50-100 pages shorter. Nevertheless, White Doves at Morning is a good book that I think you'll like if you enjoy historical fiction about this period. Burke is a very good writer and I now plan to read his other books that I have. I just wish that this book would have a provided a more enthralling story line.

If you're looking to read a book that has literary merit forget Four Blind Mice. However, if you're looking for a very-fast paced plot that will keep you turning the pages non-stop and provides edge-of-your seat action and suspense, you could do a lot worse than reading Patterson's latest Alex Cross thriller. If you've read any/many of Patterson's previous books, you're familiar with what to expect in Four Blind Mice in regards to writing style, character development, etc. I enjoyed this book a lot and it made for great escape reading on my recent business trip. It made my three hour flight seem like only minutes had gone by. Also, Patterson has provided more depth to the character of John Sampson in this book than in all of his previous books combined, which I found enjoyable. All in all, Four Blind Mice is very entertaining and is a book I think you'll enjoy.

Roderick Anscombe's The Interview Room is one of the best, well-written thillers I read in 2006. The book is very original and provocative in portraying the story of a prison psychiatrist whose twisted patient -- a sociopathic stalker -- engages him in a deadly war of wits, and which ultimately leads to a series of circumstances that turn his wife against him and implicate him in murder. In my opinion, The Interview Room will be enjoyed most by thriller lovers who seek rich character portayals, sharp, crisp dialogue and narrative skills and who like their justice subtle. Be aware that if non-stop action is what you're looking for, The Interview Room may not be the book for you. I, for one, am looking forward to reading Anscombe's earlier thriller, Shank, and will be one of the first on line to but his upcoming book, Virgin Lies, which is due out in March.

Parker's Appaloosa makes you feel that you've been transported back to a life in a small western town, dealing with gun fights, Indians and outlaws, and working with Virgil and Hitch as a town marshal. While much of the action is predictable, Appaloosa's main strength is in its very well-developed characters and its sense of the Wild West that is so real you constantly feel the need to kick the mud off your boots and to check your pistol to make sure you're ready for whatever trouble you're going to have to deal with next. If you are hankering for a good novel about an exciting era long past, Appaloosa is highly recommended. Louis L'Amour has nothing over Robert Parker in books about the Old West.

The Paladin is supposedly a novel based on facts, as told to the author by &quot;Christopher Creighton.&quot; Creighton, the paladin, was recruited as a teenage boy by Winston Churchill during WWII and sent around the world on missions of state -- usually violent missions. The premise of this novel seemed very appealing to me, as I am a big fan of WWII novels. However, overall, I was disappointed in this novel. To me, the book reads more like a CHRONICLE of Creighton's individual, exciting missions rather than a good NOVEL. I found the book just adequate (at best) in terms of plot development, character development (particularly regarding the secondary characters), and believable dialogue. There's no question that the missions Creighton supposedly carried out for his country were extremely heroic. If these supposedly previously untold missions were written as a non-fiction historical biography about Creighton, I would have had different expectations going in and might have enjoyed the book more. In a good novel, however, as mentioned, I'm looking for more than just an interesting chronicle of facts.

As in The Moscow Club and Extraordinary Powers, Joseph Finder has written a very entertaining,fast-paced book that once you start , you won't want to put down.The story has lots of surprises, the dialogue is crisp and, for the most part, realistic. The main characters are mostly likable but could have been more fully developed. Nonetheless, High Crimes is well worth reading! Further, if this is your first book by Finder, you might also want to read The Moscow Club and Extraordinary Powers. His third book, The Zero Hour, was not as good.

The basic premise of The Leader And The Damned is interesting -- i.e., the attempt by the Gestapo to kill an English spy to prevent him from revealing that from 1943 on the man supposed to be Hitler was actually his double, and that the real Hitler had died. This book had the potential to be very good and exciting. Unfortunately, what it lacks is an author skilled in being able to make you care about what happens next and in creating believable, three-dimensional characters. Other than Forbes mentioning the names of characters (fictional and real), he provides little to no description of their background, appearance, etc. They are so "cardboard-like", that I found that it difficult to read on to find out what happens next. There's no question in my mind that with a more skilled writer The Leader And The Damned could have been one of the better WWII thrillers. Instead, at best, I would consider it to be only fair. Unless you have an unsatiable need to read WWII thrillers, do yourself a favor and skip this book.

Void Moon is a fast-paced, entertaining thriller that will hold your attention. However,in comparing Void Moon to Connelly's other non-Bosch thrillers-- The Poet and Blood Works--Void Moon is not as good. Comparatively, it does not measure up on the extent of surprises, believability, and depth of character development (although Cassie Black and Jack Karch ARE interesting characters). If Void Moon is your first book by Connelly you might give it a higher rating than the '3' I gave it (which I actually would have rated a '3 1/2' if Amazon had such a rating), but it's hard for me to evaluate this book without comparing it to The Poet and Blood Works, which I would highly recommend. Keep in mind, that a '3' (or a '3 1/2') is a good rating and, as I said, Void Moon is worth reading.

Marley & Me is a well-written heart-warming and memorable story of a family and their neurotic but very lovable dog. I don't agree with the author, John Grogan, that Marley was the world's worst dog. While Marley was probably one of the most mischievous dogs, he was far from being a "bad dog." As a matter of fact, he was the type of friend that all people should hope to have -- undyingly loyal, treasuring every moment of attention you gave to him, enjoying every detail of his life no matter how trivial. Despite his neuroses, Marley taught his family (as well as the readers of Grogan's tribute to Marley) very valuable lessons about what really matters in life. As a writer, Grogan deserves all the credit and rewards he has received for reinforcing in his readers an important lesson about life and love, and for writing a book that is both heartwarming and ultimately heartbreaking. As an owner, Grogan was not a bad owner by any means; although he might not have been as deserving of the adulation given to him by his loving dog, Marley. Would a person who proclaims himself to be a loving owner and best friend, as Grogan does, try to justify his decision to not spend the couple of thousand dollars to give his best friend of thirteen years the surgery needed to try to save his life because "it seemed obscene, almost immoral, to spend that kind of money on an old dog at the end of his life when there were unwanted dogs put down every day for lack of a home, and more important, children not getting proper medical attention for lack of financial resources?" What a cop out and warped rationalization! Grogan, who was a notable newspaper columnist at this point in Marley's life, was not offering to donate this money to people who were more in need than his old dog, Marley; he just didn't seem to want to spend it on his old friend. Without going into details, there are a few other instances that might make you question if Grogan was as deserving of Marley's unwavering devotion. Putting aside these personal gripes I have with Grogan as a dog owner, Marley & Me is a very worthwhile read and is highly recommended.

Being a big fan of thrillers I am usually very tolerant of most books in this genre. However, while Dugoni exhibits some potential in his abilty to move a story along, The Jury Master went well beyond my tolerance level. As such, I cannot comfortably recommend this book to you and hope that you won't be misled by the favorable reviews The Jury Master received from other Amazon reviewers. Speaking of misleading, I bought The Jury Master because of its being positioned by the publisher as a legal thriller. While this book starts with a trial and concludes in a courtroom, The Jury Master is definitely not a legal thriller. This factor would have still been okay with me -- provided that the plot, which was more political in nature -- had been credible and not so predictable. This, however, was not the case. Further, the dialogue Dugoni has his characters speak is often stilted and his characters are, for the most part, thinly developed. And lastly, I guess because Dugoni felt a thriller should include some love interests, he provides two love stories in The Jury Master; neither of which, unfortunately are developed well enough nor resolved. All in all, The Jury Master is just good enough to finish -- but it is not good enough to recommend.

Overall, I would have rated 24 Hours 3 1/2 stars if it were possible to do so in Amazon's rating system. In 24 Hours Iles has delivered another book that moves along at a galloping pace and is packed with lots of suspense. I'd rate this book 4 1/2 stars on these qualities. Unfortunately, I found that I was able to predict much of the action and, in particular, the ending, well in advance of their occurences. Also, while the story is interesting and enjoyable to read, I found that Iles' often severely strained my ability to extend belief in his main characters. Thus, I'd give only 2 1/2 stars to 24 Hours on the dimensions of believability and credibility. Further, while not a major criticism, I would have liked 24 Hours even more if he had provided a brief epilogue to tie up some of the loose threads in the story. Having finished 24 Hours, I have now read all five books Greg Iles has written and I would recommend them all to you. However, if you are considering reading your first book by Iles, I'd recommend Mortal Fear and The Quiet Game above 24 Hours. Enjoy!

Are you interested in books that provide more than just a good story. If you look for books than provide and/or pertain to any of the following qualities -- excitement, poignancy, deception and betrayal, faith and redemption, strong and very credible characters -- than you're really going to enjoy Charles Kenney's The Son Of John Devlin. That's because it provides ALL of these qualities in spades. Give yourself a real treat and get yourself a copy of The Son Of John Devlin. And, if you really want to be good to yourself, pick up a copy of Kenney's upcoming book, The Last Man, due out in July. It's even better than this book!

What if the President of the United States is unwilling to use the military to protect U.S. citizens, and defend the nation 's rights and ideals from attack? What if Congress used a hidden clause in the Constitution to authorize military action without the President's approval? That's the spectacular theme of Balance Of Power, the thrilling debut novel from James W. Huston.For me, Balance Of Power's unique blend of the fascinating world of today's military technology with the intricacies of high-octane politics and legal maneuvering, makes it a new kind of intellectually-challenging, can't-put-it-down thriller. If you like military/political/adventure thrillers, you won't want to miss this book! It's like Tom Clancy and Stephen Coonts meet John Grisham on Patrick O'Brian's high seas. Balance Of Power's only flaw, albeit a minor one, is that it does not develop well enough the character of the bad guy, George Washington.Huston has the potential to be a new master in this genre. I can't wait to read The Price Of Power,the sequel to Balance Of Power, to see if Huston can deliver a solid &quot;one-two punch.&quot; Look over your shoulders Clancy, Coonts and Grisham-- there's a new player in town!

After reading Shelby's very good first thriller, Days Of Drums, I was somewhat disappointed in Last Rights. I found the story started out with a lot of excitement but soon dragged -- and continued to do so for much too long a stretch. The last quarter generated excitement once again but by that point I had pretty much stopped caring about the outcome. The greatest thrill for me was coming to the final page so I could move on to my next book. Shelby's writing style holds your interest, but this &quot;thriller&quot;, while fairly fast-paced, turned out to be much too predictable and, thus, not very thrilling. I was especially looking forward to reading this book after reading some of the earlier reader reviews. However, as you can see, my reading experience with Last Rights differed from theirs. Now, if you're in the mood for a good thriller in the same vein, try David Hackworth's The Price Of Honor.

Mafia Summer is a memorable story that takes hold of your gut and doesn't let go until the very end. It primarily is a tale of the friendship between two unlikely teens -- a tough Sicilian head of a street gang, the other a sickly, brilliant Jewish boy -- that are caught in the turmoil between the various Mafia families that ruled NY during the hot, steamy summer in the section of NYC called Hell's Kitchen in 1950. Vincent writes in such a way that I felt I was right there with all of the well-developed and interesting characters experiencing the strong firendships, loyalties, betrayals and full-scale crime war that took place on the rough streets of NY. Mafia Summer, E. Duke Vincent's first book, is one of the better fictional books about the Mafia that I've read in many years. While it's not on the level of the classic, The Godfather, it's not very far below -- which, to me, is very high praise. Mafia Summer is much more than an excellent book about the Mob. It's an excellent book -- period!. Enjoy!

An even better mystery than the excellent plot provided in The Rosary Girls is why Richard Montanari isn't a household name among thriller lovers. The Rosary Girls is one of the best thrillers I've read this year. The story pits two homicide detectives against a fiercely intelligent and relentlessly brutal serial killer -- a killer fueled by a twisted, sacrilegious fury. Montanari writes in a style and provides non-stop twists and turns that will have you glued to the edge of your seat. It's the type of book that you can't wait to finish to see how it ends -- but then you're sorry that it's over. I've already ordered all of Montanari's other books. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a copy of The Rosary Girls.

The Abduction involves the kidnapping of the granddaughter of one of the two candidates for President and its investigation by the Attorney General, who is also the other candidate. The plot grabs hold of your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. The characters are interesting and pretty well-developed, although some aspects in their development requires you to suspend belief a bit. While The Abduction is not great literature, it is a very good choice for when you have a plane ride or a vacation coming up, or whem you just want to escape in a good book. Enjoy!

Margolin's latest, Wild Justice, is VERY fast-paced, exciting and suspenseful. Without giving away the plot, I know you'll feel that once you start reading this book it will seem that the pages are just flying past your eyes. If you like thrillers, you won't find many recent books in this genre that will stack up to Wild Justice. The only reason that I didn't give Wild Justice a &quot;5 star&quot; rating is that despite Margolin's many and interesting efforts to keep you guessing as to who the murderer is, I was able to determine the killer too early on in the story. Even if this turns out to be your experience as well, I think you'll still feel that Wild Justice is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and is one that you'll want to recommend to others. Enjoy!

Two of Blauner's earlier works--Slow Motion Riot and The Intruder-- were excellent books. Both of which read like thrillers but are really great, adrenaline-pumping fiction. Consistent with these past successes, Blauner's latest, Man Of Honor, is another must-read and may be his best yet. If you like exciting well-written stories with well-developed and memorable characters--and who doesn't?-- rush out and buy Man Of Honor when it comes out in April. While you're at it, do yourself a favor and pick up copies of Slow Motion Riot and The Intruder as well

If you had the chance to go back in time and spend a day with a loved one that passed on, and be able to say all the things you wanted to tell them but never did, would you have the emotional strength to do it? That is the basic premise of Mitch Albom's very poignant new book, For One More Day. While some reviewers criticize this book for being sappy and intentionally trying to "pull on your heartstrings," I found it to be a well-written, sentimental fable that made me self-reflect on my own relationship with my parents. In the course of my hectic life, I have, at times, made excuses to myself for not giving them the attention they deserved. While I cannot go back and tell my father how much I appreciated all that he did for me when he was alive, For One More Day made me realize that it is not too late to do so with my 89 year-old mother. For One More Day is a book I'd highly recommend to you, and especially so if you've lost a parent.

The Mark Of The Assassin (originally to be titled The Society) is an exciting, fast-moving thriller that is well-worth reading. It has it all...interesting characters, good plot and sub-plots, lots of action and some good surprises. Silva can expect another bestseller when this book goes on-sale in March (possibly April); however, it is not without some minor flaws, such as occasional weak dialogue and a few secondary characters which could have been developed more. I think you'll be able to easily overlook these flaws.The Mark Of The Assassin is a very good second effort by Silva, but it is not as good as his previous thriller, The Unlikely Spy (which is now out in paperback).

While not quite as good as Paranoia, Finder's latest is another of his thrillers that you'll find hard to put down. Without going into a lot of detail, Company Man is about Nick Conover, CEO of a leading office furniture manufacturer, who is facing major problems at work and even bigger threats to his personal life. In typical Finder fashion, he weaves a plot of non-stop suspense and develops characters that are credible and interesting, but not without flaws. The only reason I haven't given Company Man a five star rating is that I felt the ending was somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Finder's latest thriller is well worth the investment, both in time and money. Enjoy!

From The Corner Of His Eye is another in the long list of compulsive page turners from Dean Koontz that will keep you on the edge of your seat. In many ways Koontz is at the top of his craft in his latest book. Not only is From The Corner Of His Eye is a top-notch thriller, it is perhaps his most emotionally powerful and complex book to-date -- describing themes such as love and hate, joy and terror and triumph and tragedy. Further, his cast of characters are so well-presented that many of them wiil stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. One factor, however, keeps me from giving From The Corner Of His Eye a 5-star rating. That is, Koontz focused so much of his effort on creating a narrative tour de force and many rich characterizations, he at times let the pace of the suspense slow down too much. The saying &quot;Sometimes less is better&quot; applies to this book. From The Corner Of His Eye, at 622 pages, probably would have earned 5-stars from me if it had been edited down to about 500 pages or so. Nonetheless, Koontz's latest book is well worth reading. Enjoy it!

David Clement-Davies's first novel is a truly excellent book for readers young and old alike. Fire Bringer is a gripping saga that draws you into an animal world that is at once incredibly convincing yet also a sharp reflection of our own. Epic but suspenseful and swiftly paced, Fire Bringer follows closely in the tradition of another beloved fantasy and one of my all-time favorite books, Watership Down. It is a story of war and healing, cast with unforgettable characters -- particularly Rannoch -- and told with the resonance of legend. Fire Bringer has the ability to be a classic fantasy and is perhaps the best book I've read this year. I don't give 5 star ratings often but Fire Starter is definitely worthy of it. Do yourself a favor and get a copy as soon as you can.

Numbered Account is a pretty good first effort by Christopher Reich, but he leaves definite room for improvement. The story moves along at a quick pace and holds your interest, although the plot is fairly predictable and the characters do not have much depth. Do not spend your money to buy this book in hardcover . You can definitely wait for it to come out in paperback; or better still, get it from the library

No Safe Place is somewhat of a departure from what fans have come to expect from this author. While well-written, the plot is mostly predictable and mechanical. Unlike most other books by R.N. Patterson there are no major surprises. No Safe Place would be okay to take from the library but save your money to buy another book.

With Forsyth's latest, Avenger, he has catapulted himself back to the forefront of thriller writers. Avenger is for anyone interested in a very well written book with a highly intelligent plot, excellent character development and a pace that -- while not always fast-moving -- will keep your eyes glued to the pages. I should warn you, though, that if you looking for a thriller with lot of slam-bang action, Avenger may not be for you. The basic plot is about a young American volunteer who is killed in Bosnia and the hiring of the Avenger to try to seek vengeance on the person responsible. However, the real plot of this book is much more involved and covert than this -- but is one that I won't describe further so as to not reveal the story line that really makes Avenger suspenseful. All I will say again is what I said in my title for this review -- Some crimes are better left unpunished.

The Devil's Teardrop starts off a bit slowly and,while interesting, doesn't really take off until almost the middle of the book.BUT once it does hold on to your seats and be prepared not to get up until you finish. As usual, Deaver delivers interesting characters, a well developed plot, lots of action and surprises galore. I strongly recommend that you place The Devil's Teardrop-- whose publication date is in August--at the top of your Summer Reading List.

While not as good as The Bone Collector or The Coffin Dancer, The Empty Chair has plenty to recommend it: lots of plot twists, many surprises (although some are a bit contrived), interesting supporting characters, a nice change of pace in terms of setting, and the tension between Rhyme and Sachs is often intense. If this is your first book by Deaver, The Empty Chair will entice you to read his other books. However, if you've already read The Bone Collector and The Coffin Dancer, I think you might agree with me that Deaver's latest effort -- while definitely worth reading --is a step below these works.

I've had Mine sitting on my bookshelf for over 16 years and finally got around to reading it. After finishing this exciting, pulse-pounding thriller I can assure you that my next book by McCammon will be read very soon. Mine is about Mary Terrell, aka Mary Terror, a survivor of a fanatical radical 60's group, who now lives in a hallucinary world of memories, guns and murderous rage. Mary, however, is happy at last because she has a beautiful baby boy...a baby she has stolen...and will kill to keep! Mine has enough drama, action, suspense and violence to fill several books. Be ready to forget about doing anything else once you start Mine. Enjoy!

As you may or may not know, Cradle And All is a rework of Patterson's 2nd novel called Virgin. Most likely if you read Virgin within the past few years and remember the ending you probably won't want to read Cradle And All -- even though there are differences between the two versions. But if you haven't read Virgin or read it like I did(when it first came out in 1980)and don't remember the outcome, you're in for a real treat. After reading an advance reader copy of Cradle And All, I'm sure that most Patterson fans will find many of the qualities that have made them devour his previous books. In typical Patterson fashion the plot moves along at a break-neck pace, the chapters are very brief with each ending on a note that makes you want to quickly turn the page, and the characters--while not developed in great depth--are interesting. While I'm not a particularly fast reader, I read this book in two days. Be prepared to be glued to your favorite reading place until you finish Cradle And All! You'll definitely enjoy this book.

After Patterson's last disaster, When The Wind Blows,he has redeemed himself with his newest book, Pop Goes The Weasel. This story is very exciting but light in terms of character develoment, narrative style and basically most other literary elements which make for a well-written novel. However, these are not elements I, and I think many other readers', seek in a James Patterson book.With this said, I think you will enjoy Pop Goes The Weasel very much and find it a very, very fast read. The one minor flaw that I've found in this and other Alex Cross books is the totally unrealistic maturity level and dialogue voiced by Cross's seven year old daughter, Jannie. I'd suggest that in doing research for future books, Patterson should spend a little time finding out what real seven year olds are like.

I usually like Parker's books,and particularly when he deviates from his Spenser books. So, I really was expecting to enjoy All Our Yesterdays, probably Parker's most significant departure from his 'norm" However, much to my disappointment, I found this book to be have erratic pacing, slow to develop, and not very believable or interesting characters. As such, I wound up skimming through large passages and then, ultimately, giving up on it. There are just too many books and not enough time to waste time reading All Our Yesterdays.

I've read all of Littell's books and have -- up until Legends -- enjoyed all of them very much. However, while the plot in Legends, in typical Littell fashion, is complex and well-developed, I found the pacing of the book to be too slow-moving for my tastes and the characters to be less believable and captivating than those Littell typically provides. Without going into the details of the story, which can be found in many of the other reviews, I found that Legends was a good read but not one I'd recommend that you rush out to buy and put on the top of your reading list.

Chris Mooney, in his latest book, Remembering Sarah, delivers a riveting and emotion-charged thriller based on every parent's worst fear -- the disappearance of a child. In many ways it reminds me of Mystic River by Dennis Lehane, although it is not quite as good. Mooney's main character, Mike Sullivan, the father of the missing child, is very well-deveolped and one you'll remember for a long time. In addition to being a very good thriller, Mooney's story is also tale of loss and undying hope. The only factor that keeps me from giving Remembering Sarah a 5-star rating is that the ending is a bit abrupt and leaves some "loose threads dangling." Nonetheless, this is a book that I'd recommend you put high up on your reading list. Enjoy!

David Liss is to be highly commended on his first novel. A Conspiracy Of Paper has it all -- very well developed and interesting characters (particularly Benjamin Weaver), an exciting and mysterious plot, an ability to make early 18th century London come alive for the reader,and a compelling historical perspective of the London stock market in its infancy, the criminal underworld, the powerful business elite and of anti-semitism. There is no question about the depth of research that Liss conducted to write this book, but what makes A Conspiracy Of Paper so special is the way he successfully manages to weave all of this research into a novel that will have you totally engrossed and glued to your seat. Do yourself a favor and read this book as soon as possible. I think you'll definitely enjoy the trip back in time!

Actually I would give The Homing an overall rating of 3 1/2 stars if Amazon's system allowed for this. The intensity with which the story is told deserves a 4-star rating, as your eyes will fly across the page to see what happens next. However, the quality of the writing, dialogue and character deveopment deserves only a 3-star rating. If you can accept the implausibility of the plot (which I think you have to do to enjoy a book in the horror-SF genre) and put aside any strong desire for literary quality, The Homing will provide you with several hours of excitement and horror. I'm pretty sure that after you read this book you'll never think the same way about bees again. I know I won't be able to!

Sheldon Siegel's second novel, Incriminating Evidence, is every bit as good as his very good first book, Special Circumstances; and he deserves to be placed in the top-tier of legal thriller writers. Siegel's characters are very well-developed -- particularly his continuing protagonist, Mike Daley, and his ex-wife and law partner, Rosie -- and the plot is fast-paced and bristles with energy. Siegel's ability to combine excitement, surprises, humor and suspense makes Incriminating Evidence a book that you won't want to put down. Without going into detail for fear of providing information which might weaken some of the story's suspense for you, the only thing that kept me from rating this book a '5' is that I felt slightly--and I emphasize 'slightly'-- disappointed in the ending. Nevertheless, Incriminating Evidence is a book I know you'll enjoy and will want to recommend to your friends.

This review was written by my daughter who is personal trainer.If you are looking for a push-up bar with which you can perform the most basic variation of push-ups with a greater range of motion and more tricep engagement, you might appreciate this product. However, if you are looking for a sturdy piece of equipment to do such variations as wide-grip, close-grip, staggered grip, etc. push-ups you may want to consider something with a wider base and possibly rotatiing handles, such as the Iron Gym Push-Up Pro.I will say, however, that the very low cost is great and they do give you a nice improvement on your range of motion, so you should not consider them a totally wasteful piece of equipment. The neoprene grips on the handles are very comfortable and the bars are sturdy enough for the basic push-up, so for that they are nice. You are just really limited to those, though. The base of the bars are not wide enough to do anything more, and in fact, feel a bit dangerous. I know other users have rolled their wrists...could be due to improper form; however, I can see this being a potential problem. These are supposed to assist with form, so making it even more dangerous for those who do not have proper push-up form is not a good thing.So, basically, if you can do a decent standard push-up and want to increase your range of motion, then these are a great low-cost tool for you to add to your toolbox, but if you are looking to spice things up with your push-ups, go with something more versatile, even if it's more expensive. As in anything...you get what you pay for!

In Open And Shut, Rosenfelt's debut novel, he introduces Andy Carpenter, a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney that I hope to see around for quite awhile. As a result of my enjoyment of this attention-grabbing, fast-paced legal thriller/mystery and Rosenfelt's nail-bitng writing style, I've ordered the other three books in this series. If you've enjoyed Harlan Coben's books, particularly his series featuring Myron Bolitar, I think you'll find many of the same positive characteristics in Open And Shut. Without wanting to tell too much of the plot of this exciting story, Open And Shut involves Andy Carpenter seeking a new trial for a man who, after being suceesfully prosecuted for murder by Andy's father seven years earlier, is on death row with time running out. The only reason for my not giving this book a five-star rating is that Rosenfelt does not give closure to a few of the sub-plots; however, I assume these "loose threads will be tied tighter" in his subsequent books in the series. I highly recommend Open And Shut to you.

After looking forward to the next book featuring Lincoln Rhyme, I found it to be enjoyable but a bit of a letdown (after Tbe Bone Collector and A Maiden's Grave). The story dragged in a few areas, included a bit too much forensic details and some of the characters were not very interesting. All in all, if you can escape from making comparisons you probably will find it to be a worthwhile read.

Messiah provides non-stop thrills from the first to the very last page. Starling weaves a variety of interesting sub-plots, all of which converge successfully at the end--and what an ending it is!! Make show that when you sit down to read Messiah you won't need to get up any time soon, because once you start you're eyes are going to be glued to the pages and you're going to lose all track of time.

In Hostile Witness, William Lashner's debut legal thriller, the author rises to the top of writers in this genre. In Victor Carl, he has create a very believable, very real and very flawed hero. What makes this book worth reading is Lashner's strength in character development. Further, the plot is also very clever and interesting --although, for me, it is stretched out somewaht longer than I felt it needed to be. At times, I found myself skimming through sections about the 'characters' in order to get back to the 'heart of the story'. As a result, unlike most reviewers who gave this book a five star rating, I'd rate it worthy of four stars -- a very good, but not outstanding rating. I think if this book was 100 or so pages less, I would have enjoyed it a lot more and probably rated it five stars. Despite this criticism, Hostile Witness is a worthwhile read. I'm looking forward to reading Lashner's other books featuring Victor Carl (Veritas, Fatal Flaw and Past Due).

Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre.

After a six year absence, Coben brings back his hero from his excellent series, the Myron Bolitar mysteries. In typical Coben fashion, Promise Me is a fast-paced, suspenseful mystery that is packed with twists and turns and will keep you guessing about 'whodunit' throughout. Further, if you've read the previous Bolitar books in the series, Promise Me will provide a lot of enjoyable back story information about what Myron, his parents, Win, Esperanza and Big Cindi have been up to in the past six years. While Bolitar is the main character, the plot of Promise Me follows the winning formula Coben has developed in his excellent stand-alone thrillers -- i.e., a simple domestic situation that escalates into a major event in which his hero/heroine becomes the main suspect and must work to prove his/her innocence as well as help determine who the guilty party is. In this particular story, Bolitar overhears two teenage girls talking talking about driving home drunk from a party and makes them promise that if they are ever in trouble or in a compromising situation to call him at any hour, and he'll come help them -- no questions asked. A few weeks later one of the girls calls to hold him to his promise. From that point on Myron's world becomes topsy-turvy and the reader's world becomes one of some sleepless nights. The only factors keeping me from giving Promise Me a five-star rating are that Coben's development of his secondary characters are a little weak and he leaves some unanswered questions involving these characters. Nonetheless, Promise Me is a book that is well-worth reading and is sure to find itself near the top of the bestseller list. My promise to you is that you will find Promise Me to be a very enjoyable reading experience. But if you don't, don't complain to me or give me an unfavorable review or I'll have to call Myron to get Win to come pay you a little visit. I'm already looking forward to the next book by Coben and I hope I'll be seeing Myron and his crew again sooner rather than later. Once again, welcome back, Myron!

Steven Salinger's second novel, White Darkness, is a very strong follow-up to his highly praised debut book, Behold The Fire. White Darkness is an exciting urban-Caribbean thriller that represents a refreshing and interesting introduction to the genre. It grabs hold of your attention from the first page and doesn't let go until the last page. It's the type of book that you just want to keep reading to see what happens next -- but also one you don't want to see end. White Darkness is more than just a very good thriller with characters you really feel you know, it's a story of the American Dream, the new immigrant experience and an evil that transcends peoples and cultures. I would have, if possible in Amazon's system, rated this book 4 1/2 stars. I didn't rate it 5 stars because some of the plot was too contrived and because Salinger didn't tie together some of the plot twists and relationships tightly enough. Nonetheless, these minor flaws should not deter you from putting White Darkness high up on your To-Be-Read list. Enjoy!

Peter Blauner, the author of such excellent books as The Last Good Day, Man Of The Hour, The Intruder and Slow Motion Riot, is one of my favorite authors. His latest work, Slipping Into Darkness -- which is about two murders and the resolution to a twenty-year old secret -- is well-worth reading, as Blauner continues his streak of books that combine an emotionally-charged plot with rich, multi-dimensional, credible and interesting characters. With that said, however, Slipping Into Darkness, is a notch below the above-mentioned books. The reason for this is that, for me, Blauner introduced a few too many elements about his characters which worked to slow down the pace of the plot. Further, I would have preferred to have some of these elements clarified at the end rather than be somewhat ambiguous. Although, in fairness, these quibbles of mine do help contribute to the realism of the plot and his characters. If Slipping Into Darkness is your first book by this excellent author, I think you'll enjoy it very much. If you're already a fan of his, you'll still enjoy the book, just perhaps a little less so than some of his others.

Greg Iles is an author from who I've come to expect excellence. While The Footprints Of God is a fairly good book, it does not measure up to Iles' past perfomances. In typical Iles fashion, the book is well-written. However, the plot, while ambitious in scope, is too convoluted and takes too long too develop. I found myself losing interest in many passages and began to skim through these sections. Further, the characters in The Footprint Of God are not nearly as well-developed as in most of Iles' other books and are somewhat unbelievable. This book might have been more enjoyable had it been about 100 pages shorter. Iles has definitely redeemed himself in his latest book, Blood Memory, which I highly recommend.

Three of Blauner's earlier works--Slow Motion Riot, The Intruder and Man Of The Hour-- were excellent books. Both of which read like thrillers but are really great, adrenaline-pumping fiction. Consistent with these past successes, Blauner's latest, The Last Good Day, is another must-read and may be his best yet. As a matter of fact, referring to this book as a very good -- even an excellent -- thriller does it an injustice. Its strong, well-developed, credible characters, its smart dialogue, its ability to capture the mood and fear in an affluent suburban community shortly following 9/11 and a local murder makes The Last Good Day a book you don't want to put down -- but, at the same time, don't want to see come to an end. Beyond its exciting plot, Blauner has created a work of fiction that places it near the top of a very limited group of books in regards to rich prose and style. Do yourself a favor and put The Last Good Day at the top of your Must Read list. While you're at it, do yourself another favor and pick up copies of Slow Motion Riot, The Intruder and Man Of The Hour as well.

In David Ellis' second legal thriller he once again delivers a very well-written, very intelligent legal thriller, with strong, well-developed characters and crisp, realistic dialog. The plot involves big-city politics woven into an intriguing, compelling murder mystery, and has many surprises that will keep you guessing until the very end. My one problem with Life Sentence, which prevents me from giving it a 5-star rating, is that Ellis tended to go on for too long a time before bringing the story to its, ultimately, very satisfying and surprising conclusion. In my opinion, Life Sentence would have been an even better book had Ellis followed the old adage, "less is more."

Having loved Andrews' last book, Icarus, and also liking his first book, Gideon, very much, I couldn't wait to read his new book. Aphrodite doesn't disappoint in terms of being fast-paced and exciting. However, it doesn't compare to Icarus (in particular) in terms of providing pulse-pounding suspense, credible plot twists and turns and an ending that keeps you guessing until the last page. Aphrodite is about a small-town cop &quot;with a past&quot; who uncovers a crime that involves a conspiracy that can have devastating consequences unless he can put a stop to it. Similar to his previous books, Aphrodite grabs your attention from the first page. However, I found the plot dragged too much during the middle of the book and I had some credibility issues with some of the characters, particularly the relative ease with which the hero is able to uncover and stop the major conspiracy. So, while I found Aphrodite to be an enjoyable read, I cannot give it a 5-star rating (as I gave Andrews' other books) because the plot was somewhat predictable without many surprises. Further, I found some of the characters to be unbelievable and not too well-developed (particularly the cop's girlfriend's daughter, who is too glib for her age). If you're willing to suspend belief a little more than you usually do in reading a thriller, I think you'll find Aphrodite to be a good, entertaining-- but not very memorable -- book.

With Back Spin Coben scores another solid hit. Its plot is very fast-paced, the dialogue is crisp, the characters are well-developed, the humor is well-integrated within the non-stop suspense, and you'll be guessing &quot;who-done-it&quot; right up until the end. Could you ask for anything more in a mystery? This is definitely enough for me and I think you'll be more than satisfied as well. If this will be your first Simon Bolitar book by Coben, you're in for a treat. If you've read other Coben books you KNOW you're in for a treat with Back Spin. Enjoy!

Faded Coat Of Blue, Owen Parry's debut novel of historical suspense in his series featuring Abel Jones is a worthwhile read. However, while deciding on whether to read this book, make sure that your interest skews more to the history element than the mystery element. Parry's historical recreation of the Civil War period in and around Washington D.C. is very interesting and insightful, his narrative skills are excellent, and his dvelopment of his hero, Abel Jones is first rate. The combination of Parry's abilities in these areas makes you feel that you are right there along side Jones in this turbulent period of the nation's history. Be aware, however, that Faded Coat Of Blue is more a novel of historical fiction than a mystery. The mystery element is not very mysterious and somehat predictable; and serves more as the vehicle to convey the history of the time period and to develop the very likable Abel Jones. If this is acceptable to you, I think you'll enjoy Fade Coat Of Blue very much and go on to read the next two books in the series (as I plan to do). However, if your interest lies more in reading a mystery that will keep you guessing and &quot;on the edge of your seat,&quot; you may want to skip this book.Whatever, your decision, I hope you enjoy your next reading experience!

John Katzenbach has been one of my favorite authors and still is, despite his mediocre performance in The Madman's Tale. Based on the basic premise of the book -- in which a murder takes place within a mental hospital -- I was expecting, in typical Katzenbach style, to be engrossed from beginning to end. However, this is far from what happened. As a result of the author's overabundance of narrative detail and excessively long descriptive passages, the pace of the book was too slow to provide the steady building of suspense and excitement I look for in a thriller. To reiterate, The Madman's Tale is not a bad book, it's just not anything special and is below the standard I've come to expect from Katzenbach.

A German Requiem is the third book in Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy featuring Bernie Gunther, a tough-talking, hard-drinking, chain-smoking, cynical ex-cop, now private detective. A German Requiem, which takes place in the wreckage of post-WW II Berlin and Vienna, has Gunther infiltrating a group of ex-Nazis to resolve a possible murder frame-up of an ex-colleague of his. Kerr excels in describing the atmosphere during this time period and has developed several multidimensional and, for the most part, interesting characters. With a faster-paced plot, I would have given A German Requiem a 4-4 1/2 star rating. However, the plot, while enjoyable, moved at too slow a pace for me to maintain a strong interest in its outcome; and consequently, resulted in my overall rating of 3 1/2 stars. Let me be clear that A German Requiem is a decent read and would likely be very appealing to readers of the first two books in Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy as well as to fans of Raymond Chandler, Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe mysteries. However, at no time did the book have me on the edge of my seat to find out what happens next. If you decide to read A German Requiem I'd suggest you borrow it from the library rather than buying it.

Drury has written this book in the same style as Advise and Consent and some of his earlier bestsellers, but that's where the comparison ends. A Thing Of State only mildly holds your attention. Too little happens over long passages to keep you engrossed. On a few occasions I even thought about giving up on it. While Drury continues to demonstrate his strong knowledge of high level politics (although you might not agree with his personal opinions), my basic reaction to this is WHO CARES if he's not telling a story that sustains my interest. Save your time and money and read something else.

After reading Flynn's first two books, Term Limits and Transfer Of Power, I was looking forward to another tale of non-stop action and thrills. Much to my surprise, however, The Third Option,was a big disappointment. The plot was too dragged out and the action was neither very exciting nor frequent enough. Further, the biggest letdown in this book pertained to it's conclusion -- or lack thereof. The Third Option ends leaving the reader "hanging." Flynn is an author that I felt I could count on for edge-of-your-seat suspense and a very satisfying reading experience. Unfortunately, Flynn let me down big-time in his third effort featuring Mitch Rapp. I'm hoping that this book was just a fluke and that the others in the series will live up to the high expectations I have when I pick up a Vince Flynn book.

Ablow shows considerable potential in his first novel, Denial. It has interesting characters,an interesting plot and it moves along at a fast pace. The only thing that kept me from rating it a &quot;4&quot; is that it is a little far fetched that the clues, which seem to consistently evade the police, seem to just &quot;fall into Clevenger's lap&quot;. Denial is definitely a worthwhile read if you like thrillers, and I have already purchased Ablow's new book, Projection, which continues to feature Frank Clevenger, the psychiatrist.

In A Dry Season is a very written written book with well-developed, multi-dimensional characters, and a descriptive style that makes you feel that you are right there in the small English town in which the story takes place. What it is not, however, is a mystery that has a lot of excitement, suspense and surprises; which is what I was looking for when I decided to read this book. My 3 1/2 star rating is based on the fact that the book did not deliver well enough on my in-going expectations. Nonetheless, Peter Robinson is a very good writer and I will know better about what to expect from him the next time I decide to read one of his books. And there will be a next time. If you are in the mood for a mystery that is built more on character development versus one built more on plot development than In A Dry Season is a book I think you might enjoy very much.

I've been a big fan of Joseph Finder since his first book, The Moscow Club. However, I thought his last two books of corporate suspense, Paranoia and The Company Man, helped to raise him to the highest plateau of writers in this genre. Now, with Killer Instinct he's elevated himself to the creme de la creme. For me, just the news of a new book by Finder gives me something to look forward to and he never lets me down. Without giving away to much of the plot, Killer Instinct is about a young sales executive at an electronics company who, while successful at his job, is considered to lack the killer extinct to move up to management. But after getting an ex-Special Forces officer a job at his company in Corporate Security, success for the sales executive seems unstoppable. Killer Instinct had me glued to the edge of my seat from the first to the last sentence. Tension builds and builds, thrills and surprises seem neverending and the characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Finder's newest book is his best to date and is one of the best books I've read in quite awhile. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy as soon as you can. Just be prepared to give up almost everything else once you start this book. As I said, Killer Instinct by Joseph Finder is a keeper.

Installing the Crucial 2GB memory upgrade was a snap, taking only about a minute to do, and has significantly increased the processing speed on my Samsung network. In addition, I have been able to install and run several additional programs and devices on my own without any sacrifice in speed or performance ( Microsoft Office, McAfee Total Protection, and the VLC multi-media player to name a few). Overall, an excellent memory upgrade for a netbook at an excellent price.

I've been a big fan of John Farris from when he published his first novel -- Harrsion High --while (I believe) he was still a high school student. To me, his best works are The Fury and Sharp Practice. For about the first third of Dragonfly, I thought this book was going to rival his best. However, the last two-thirds became predictable and unrealistic. Farris' depiction of the women in this book are love-starved, easily conned, defenseless and in desparate need of a man's attention. For this male reader, these characters were poorly developed and it seemed more like a Harlequin romance novel than a thriller. While Farris tried hard to create suspense and surprises in Dragonfly, he didn't succeed as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully, Farris will recapture his ability to create edge-of-the-seat suspense, strong plots and credible characters. I'll be looking forward to the return of the &quot;old&quot; Farris in his future books.

Beverly Swerling's City Of Dreams is a sweeping epic of (primarily) two families starting from Manhattan's beginnings as a Dutch colony in the 1660's through the American Revolution, when New York became a new nation's city of dreams. Swerling provides the right blend of interesting historical facts about Nieuw Amsterdam/New York and the early days of medicine, mystery, excitement, sex, a well-developed plot, and a array of fictional and real characters to make City Of Dreams a book that is difficult to put down. Her strong writing ability made me feel that I stepped back over 300 years in time and was right there with the characters experiencing life during a fascinating time in our history. I highly recommend The City Of Dreams if you are a fan of historical fiction. I'm looking forward to reading Swerling's two other books, Shadowbrook and City Of Glory.

After tiring of hearing me complain about how I could step on our digital scale one time after the next and never get the same reading twice, my wife bought me the Health o Meter Physician Balance Beam Scale as a Christmas present. I am very glad she did! The scale, with its heavy gauge steel base and platform, is just like the one you'd find in your doctor's office and is just as accurate.Being a person with ten thumbs when it comes to products requiring assembly, I was a bit intimidated when I saw the large box in which the scale came. However, my concern was unwarranted as the product was quite easy and fast to assemble as long you follow the simple directions for positioning the pieces. Further, once assembled my days of complaints were over, and I am still singing the praises of this scale that provides consistently accurately measures up to 450 pounds in 0.25-pound increments. Beyond its professional accuracy in terms of measuring weight, it also provides accurate height measurements up to 78 inches Unfortunately, however, it appears that I have shrunk a half-inch since I last measured my height many years ago.Amazon's price for this scale is a pretty good one, and while it is not an inexpensive item, it is one from which you'll definitely get your money's worth. Highly recommended!

I have been a big fan of most of David Baldacci's books and loved his first, Absolute Power. However, his newest book, Split Second, is one of the worst books I've read in quite awhile, and I feel so cheated by Baldacci that I'm uncertain if I'll take a chance on future books by him. While Split Second started off like it was going to be an enjoyable book, it deteriorated at warp-speed. The following lists just some of the problems with this stinker -- the plot is unbelievably far-fetched , the dialogue is so amateurish it seems like it was written by a child, the characters are not credible and cartoon-like in their development, the intended suspense is (for the most part) ho-hummish, and the ending -- oh, that ending -- is ridiculous!While I try to find point out good aspects in books that are not so good overall, I cannot do so for this book. The only mystery associated with Split Second for me was why I bothered to finish this very poorly written book.

Having read all of the books Lincoln Child coauthored with Douglas Preston, I was looking forward to reading Child's first solo effort. However, while the concept on which the book is based is interesting, I was very disappointed in Utopia, and would not recommend it. Overall, the plot was much too simplistic and predictable. The characters were not credible or well-developed,and were very stereotypical. And the action tended to sputter along. As another reviewer stated it, "Imagine yourself on a roller coaster. You're all hyped up because it's about to start. When it does, you get all excited. Then the ride stops. Then starts again. Then stops. Then starts again". That's exactly how I, too, felt while reading Utopia. If Child had spent more time on plot and character development and less on computers, robotics and modern technology, Utopia could have been a very good book. Well, hopefully, when Child pairs up again with Preston, he will redeem himself for this well-conceived but rather poorly executed techno thriller.

After reading Montanari's excellent fourth and latest novel of suspense, The Rosary Girls, I decided to read his second thriller, The Violet Hour. The Violet Hour is a tale of serial terror and revenge that is mostly chilling and powerful. It is a very good book and clearly demonstrates the potential that was fulfilled in The Rosary Girls. The plot is exciting and well developed and moves along at a steady pace, which will make you want to keep turning the pages. The characters, however, are somewhat thinly deveolped and, without going into detail, some of the situations that occur are a bit implausible. Nevertheless, these criticisms are far overshadowed by the suspense generated by a very talented writer. I'm looking forward to reading Montanari's new book, The Skin Gods, which will be in the bookstores tomorrow.

While I'm not sorry I read &quot;Something Dangerous&quot;, all in all, my recommendation to you would be to skip to &quot;something else&quot;. Redmond's first effort moves along quickly and generally holds your attention. However, there is little depth to the characters, and there is little suspense because you'll be able to guess what happens well before it actually occurs. Upon finishing Something Dangerous I, at first, thought I'd make a great detective, given that I was able to predict almost all of the events that happened. But then I realized that this book was just not very good.

Overall, The Enemy is a moderately entertaining book, but one I found myself being able to put down easily and not feel the urge to rush back to. The basic plot of a General being found dead at an unexpected site and Jack Reacher's investigation of it starts off exciting and makes for very fast reading. However, for about the next two-thirds of the book, it dragged on for very long passages of time without providing much in the way of thrills and excitement. It became overly methodolical and plodding. Jack Reacher, who is always an interesting character, continues to be so in The Enemy, but to a lesser extent than in previous books. While the ending picked up in terms of excitement and suspense, it was too little too late for me. The Enemy, if you decide to read it, is a book to take from the library or wait to buy in paperback. It is a book that I think you'll find satisfactory, but is not one that I'd recommend you put high up on your "to be read" list.

Even though you basically know what the outcome of Sudden Prey will be shortly after you start it, Sandford--as usual-- keeps your eyes glued to the pages and your fingers anxious to turn them. Davenport, the cop, and Sandford, the writer, continue in form--top notch at what they do.

David Clement-Davies follows up his excellent first novel, Fire Bringer, with another wonderful multilayered animal fantasy. The Sight explores the landscape of our fairy tales and nightmares in the company of animals -- primarily wolves -- whose capacity for loyalty and savagery mirror our own. Clement-Davies has created a plot that is rich with suspense, pathos, and tenderness; and has developed characters that will stay with this reader forever (e.g., Larka, Hutttser, Palla, Fell, Bran, Kar and Morgra to name a few). The Sight is more than just an excellent book -- it is an excellent reading experience. You'll find yourself filled with joy and, all too often, with pain as you feel that you are right there with these wolves going through their incredible journey. I very highly recommend The Sight, which should have wide appeal across age and intellectual levels. Do yourself a favor and put The Sight (as well as Clement-Davies' Fire Bringer) high up on your reading list.

Having read The Poet (as well as all of Michael Connelly's other books), I was anticipating a really special book when I started The Narrows. After all, it involves Harry Bosch, Rachel Walling and The Poet ... how could it be anything less than special? Unfortunately, while The Narrows is well written and holds your interest, it is just an average mystery, and not a book that I'd recommend highly to you. The basic problem I had is that the book is more of an investigation with few major surprises and not much that is really mysterious. Accept for the last few pages, the plot was pretty predictable and provided very little excitement. Atypical of most of Connelly's other books, The Narrows was one I could easily put down to do something else without feeling the urge to rush right back to the book. Also unlike many of Connelly's other books, the story dragged on for long passages without much of interest occurring; and so I at times found myself skimming through the pages. The Narrows is not a bad book; it's just one that is not much more than an average read. If The Narrows is going to be your first book by Connelly, you might be a bit disappointed. I think you'll enjoy it more if you first read The Poet.

I'm glad Deviant Ways wasn't the first book by Chris Mooney that I read, or it probably would have been the last. Deviant Ways has an interesting, although not very original, plot and it does have its moments of excitement. However, the characters never came to life for me and I found I gave up on caring what happened to them. Further, the "bad guy" seriously lacked credibility. It came to a point that I found myself skimming through the last third of the book, and the only real thrill I got from Deviant Ways was when I came to its end. Do yourself a favor and skip this book, but do read Remembering Sarah by Mooney.

Darkness Bound, Larry Brooks' first novel, starts off very strong and maintains its strength through the first two-thirds of the book. I'd rate the book &quot;4 stars&quot; up to this point. However, the last third only gets a &quot;2 star&quot; rating, as it didn't sustain my interest and all I wanted to do was finish the book so I could move on to my next one. The basic problem for me is that Brooks introduced so many plot twists -- most of which I was able to anticipate --that the story became too far-fetched and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. As for the book being promoted as an erotic thriller, the erotism is tepid, at best. Overall, Brooks has a writing style that makes Darkness Bound a fast read, and he definitely does have potential. Hopefully, his next book will be stronger on credible character and plot development.

I loved Miller's first book, The Last Family, and was very pleased to learn that after many years of waiting he wrote a new thriller called Upside Down. I bought an ARC of this book, which also included a second new thriller by him called Inside Out. Unfortunately, the high expectations I had for Upside Down were far from met; and my disappointment was so strong that I'm not sure if I'll read Inside Out. While Miller provides an abundance of action throughout the book, the dialogue he provides is so poorly written and his characters are so thinly developed and shallow that I found myself not caring enough about what was to happen next. The main area of suspense for me was to see if I could win the struggle to finish this disappointing book. While I won this "battle", I probably lost the "war," as my confidence in an author for whom I had high hopes may be gone for good. Do yourself a favor and skip this book; but if you come across a copy of The Last Family, definitely read it.

Andrew Gross, a graduate of the James Patterson school of fiction writng, follows his mentor's and, at times, co-collaborator's style of writing to a tee. As a matter of fact, if the author's name had been excluded from the book and you were asked to guess who the writer is, I think you'd swear that it is James Patterson. So, If you are a fan of James Patterson's books, you'll probably like The Blue Zone. In its favor, it is a very fast read. However, like most of Patterson's books in recent years, The Blue Zone's characters are one-dimensional at best and mostly lack credibility; its plot, while at times exciting, is very far-fetched; and many of its intended surprises are often telegraphed far enough in advance that they turn out to not be very surprising. Some reviewers feel that since The Blue Zone is the author's first book as a solo writer, he'll develop a more original style and improve as a writer. I'd like to believe that is true -- but I don't think that this is likely to happen. While The Blue Zone is Gross' first book without James Patterson, it is his fourth book that follows the almost exact writing style (i.e. the first three being The Jester, Lifeguard and Judge and Jury). My basic belief is that the Patterson-style has brought Gross some success in the past, so why tamper with a proven formula -- even if that formula was created by someone else. I guess when the decision has to be made to whether to "find your voice" and run the risk of not being very financially successful or "cloning yourself" after a proven winner, Gross has made the decision to write in the style that "will show me the money." As said, if you're a fan of Patterson's fast-paced,totally plot-driven writing style, you'll probably like The Blue Zone. But, if you're looking for something more, skip this book.

Billy Strobe is a character you won't soon forget and the book is one you won't be able to put down once you start reading it. Martel has risen right to the top of legal thriller writers with this effort. The plot is multi-layered, the characters are very well-developed, the action is non-stop and the description of prison life will make you sure to never want to stray from the straight and narrow. While it could be argued that some of the trial scenes are a bit far-fetched, I personally had no problem with this. If you are in the mood for a legal thriller, or any type of suspenseful book, you'd have to search pretty hard to find a book that will be more captivating than Billy Strobe. I highly recommend this book to you. Enjoy!

Like most of the books in McBain's 87th Precinct series, Ghosts tells an interesting story and provides a very fast read. However, also typical of McBain&quot;s mysteries is the fact that the police detectives he regularly has &quot;star&quot; in his books are secondary to his plots and, thus, are only superficially developed. Having read many of the books in this series, I don't feel that I know his characters in any, or at least much, more depth than after the first 87th Precinct book I read. You must be willing to accept the fact that you're not going to get much more than a good story from McBain in this series. This usually has been enough for me. But to be honest, having read the books in the series by Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly and Harlan Coben, where you not only get very good and exciting mysteries but well-developed characters, McBain's 87th Precinct series has been steadily losing its appeal to me.

Usually I buy and read a Prey book from Sandford soon after it hits the store. However, due to the very mixed reviews Hidden Prey received I put off reading it until about a week ago. Bottom line is I should have avoided this book -- at best, it's mediocre. The plot (which is described in detail in other reviews) started off interesting but became much too drawn out and, ultimately, somewhat boring. Further, the character of Lucas Davenport is much more subdued in Hidden Prey than other Prey books, making him less appealing, and the "bad guys" (grandpa and grandson) are not very well developed and lack credibility. While Sandford let me down in Hidden Prey, he still remains one on my top tier authors and I plan to read his latest, Broken Prey, soon.

Let's start with the obvious to anyone who's read a book in the Harry Bosch series. Lost Light is a very well written mystery, the main character is one of the best developed and multi-dimensional to be featured in a mystery series, and the plot is complex and keeps you guessing. However, on a comparative basis, Lost Light is more slow paced and less action-packed and suspenseful. Perhaps Bosch's now being a private eye versus a cop has made it seem to me that he doesn't have the same toughness and &quot;edge&quot; that made him such a memorable character in earlier books in the series. It will be interesting to see what direction Connelly takes Bosch in upcoming books. If you read this book you'll see that Connelly has created several options for Bosch. I'll be anxious to travel along with Bosch (and some other characters Connelly has featured in other books) in his next adventure, The Narrows, which will be released soon.

Each time time Lehane writes a new book it is better than the ones that came before it -- and keep in mind his first book, A Drink Before The War was VERY GOOD. Prayers For Rain is a book that you won't be able to put down once you start it. In typical Lehane fashion, the plot grabs your attention from page one and never lets up; and the main characters, Patrick and Angie, come across as so real you feel that you are one of their friends (or at least would like to be one). And let's not forget Bubba -- and I don't mean Clinton. Bubba is definitely one of my favorite bad/good guys in fiction, and is someone I'd want on my side if I was ever in major trouble. In Prayers For Rain Lehane provides insights into Bubba's character like never before. Don't miss this book!

After reading my first Dennis Lehane book -- Gone, Baby, Gone -- all I can say is I'm hooked! Great plot, very well- developed and real characters and a writing style that makes you want to finish the book in one sitting. I've just gone out and bought two others in the series --Sacred and Prayers For Rain -- and am looking for the others. If you like good,exciting mysteries, especially ones that depict real life situations (i,e, every outcome does not always have a happy ending), than add Lehane to your list of must-read authors!

As evidenced by my title for this review, I didn't care for Critical Mass. As a matter of fact. I'm being generous giving it a 2-star rating. I decided to read Critical Mass because I was given it and 9 other books by Hagberg by my brother; now I have to decide if I want to invest more of my time reading this author. In my opinion, Hagberg's premise for Critical Mass was interesting, but his character development in general is weak and his main character -- CIA assassin and top agent, Kirk McCarvey, comes across more like a cartoon-like action figure than a real person. Further, Hagberg's narrative style and ability to create dialog that people would actuall speak leaves a lot to be desired. If this isn't enough to convince you to bypass this book, the action sequences, while numerous, are mostly predictable and not very exciting. I'm not usually this critical about someone's work, but Critical Mass was, to me, a crtical mess.

There's not much more you could ask for in a book than what Deaver provides in his latest excellent thriller, The Stone Monkey. Very strong plot, very well developed primary and secondary characters, lots of suspense,and quality writing. Once you start this book be prepared to not get up until you finish it. The only thing I wished Deaver spent more time on was the continuing relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs. But there's always the next book in this terrific series! Do yourself a favor and put this book on the top of your to-be read list. I'm sure you'll be glad you did!

If you are looking for a good quality, very reasonably priced watch that is sure to have people stop and compliment you on it, then the Fossil FS2920 is for you. In just two days since I received it as a Christmas present from my daughter three people on separate occasions have commented on how much they liked the watch's blue face, its unusual band and its overall style. Be aware that the watch is somewhat thick-faced and no lightweight. Rest assured, however, it feels very comfortable on the wrist and is not overpowering -- and I don't have a large wrist. I have many watches and many that cost much more than my new Fossil; although I am enjoying wearing the FS2920 as much as any of them. If you're in the market for a watch whose looks will set it apart from most others, I recommend you consider the Fossil FS-2920.

Deadspin delivers an interesting plot with well-developed characters. What kept this book from being a top-notch legal thriller for me, however, is Macgregor's too heavy emphasis on describing every mood, thought and motivation his main characters experience. As a result, the book dragged on in many passages and, thus, was unable to sustain a high level of continuous excitement. The old adage "less is more" definitely applies for Deadspin. If Deadspin was 100 pages or so shorter, it would have been a much better book. Overall, Deadspin is entertaining and you probably won't be disappointed if you read it -- but there are much better books out there in this genre.

James Siegel's Detour is a very fast-paced, entertaining, enjoyable book that is perfect for the beach or your next plane. It is the type of "thrill a minute" read that will make you forget about everything else going on around you. With that said, you should know that Detour is not as good as Siegel's previous excellent thriller, Derailed. I think that some reviewers couldn't assess Detour without directly comparing it to Derailed, which accounts for some of the lower ratings it's received. Hopefully, this won't prevent you from reading Detour. Without going into detail, the plot pertains to a mother's love, a father's devotion and an adopted daughter who turns their lives upside down. Does some of what happens strain the limits of belief? Does some of how the parents respond to their situation seem at times far-fetched? Maybe so. But this is fiction and a thriller! Enjoy Detour for what it is intended to be -- pure fun and excitement. I hope this review is helpful.

Overall, I'd give The Last Vampire 3 1/2 stars if this was possible in Amazon's rating system. In terms of originality and imagination, The Last Vampire has few equals in this genre, and Miriam Blaylock is a character you won't be likely to forget. Strieber does a very good job in creating a new theory about how and why the human race evolved, and in presenting the lore of the Keepers. On these dimensions, The Last Vampire is worthy of at least a 4 star rating and possibly 5 stars. What brings me to give the book an overall rating of 31/2 stars is the inconsistency in the pace of the plot and in the dialogue. For me, there were some passages where the pace and dialogue were so fast-moving and crisp that I couldn't put the book down. However, there were several times where the opposite was true -- the plot tended to get bogged down and the dialogue was too phony and unrealistic. Also, while the ending was exciting, it was somewhat contrived and a little bit unsatisfying. It seems that Strieber's greater purpose for this ending was to provide for yet another sequel rather than a true &quot;ending&quot; to this story. As you may know, The Last Vampire is a sequel to The Hunger (which was Strieber's second book written in 1981), which, too me, is a classic in this genre. If you haven't read The Hunger, please do so. It's my second favorite vampire-related book; surpassed only by Strieber's first book, The Wolfen. Also, if you plan to read The Last Vampire -- and it is worth reading -- do yourself a favor and read The Hunger first. It will give you a much greater understanding of Miriam Blaylock, as well as to Sarah Roberts, one of the main supporting characters. Enjoy!

Rosenfelt succesfully follows up his first three novels, Open And Shut, First Degree and Bury The Lead, with Sudden Death. Rosenfelt continues to grow as one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers due to his ability to provide interesting plots, credible courtroom drama, plenty of surprises, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters. Andy Carpenter, the main character who is a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney, is one that stays in your mind even after you finish the book and is one that I'm looking forward to 'hang out' with in his future legal adventures. Plus, his dog, Tara, is one I wish I had. I highly recommend Sudden Death when you're in the mood for a fast-paced, easy read. However, you might want to first consider reading the other books in the series which I think will further your appreciation of Sudden Death.

In Veritas, Lashner's second novel featuring Victor Carl and company, he proves that Hostile Witness, was no fluke. Lashner's characters are multidimensional and memorable. His plot is well-developed with interesting sub-plots and his narrative style keeps the flow of the book moving along at a nice pace. Veritas is well-worth reading but it is not without some flaws. Lashner uses so many characters that it is hard at times to keep track of who's who to whom without a scorecard, so to speak. Further, it took a bit too long to tie together the complex main plot and sub-plots, and some of the decriptive passages went on too long. A little more editing would have made Veritas even more enjoyable for me. Nonetheless, Lashner is one of the better writers in his genre today and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his books.

John Hart's first novel is well-written, engrossing, has a moderately suspenseful plot and is rich in character development. Hart's writing style in many ways reminds me of Scott Turow's. The King Of Lie's plot basically revolves around the lawyer, Jackson Workman ("Work") Pickens, whose life is deeply affected by the earlier death of his mother and from the mystery surrounding the disappearance of his father, with whom "Work" is in partnership. As a result, Pickens's law practice and personal life is in shambles. "Work's" life changes dramatically with the discovery of his father's murdered body. Hart demonstrates considerable potential in The King Of Lies, yet, it is not without flaws. While the characters are richly developed, they are mostly emotionally scarred and somewhat whiney; thus becoming somewhat annoying and making me not care too much about them. As a consequence, my overall liking of the book was less than it could have been and I, at times, found the plotting to be slow-moving. Further, without going into detail, Hart leaves some "threads untied", such as about what happens to the homeless man who helps Pickens, and what were the motivations of the female detective for deciding to pursue Pickens from the onset with such vehemence. Despite these flaws, Hart is clearly a very talented writer. I definitely plan to read his second book, Down River, as well as his upcoming book, The Last Child.

Line Of Visiom, an Edgar winner and David Ellis' first book, is well worth reading. The plot, which involves the confession by Marty Kalish, an investment banker, to killing his lover's husband and the trial to defend him is well-developed, the characters -- and especially the main character -- are very credible and three-dimemsional and the pace, once the trial begins, is faster than a speeding bullet. If that's not enough to generate interest in reading this strong first effort, it's filled with red herrings and lots of surprises. The only factor that keeps me from giving Line Of Vision a 5-star rating is that Ellis takes a bit too long to get to the trial portion of the book. Despite this minor criticism, Line of Vision is a well above average legal thriller and David Ellis is an author that deserves your attention. Enjoy!

Richard Montanari has quickly become one of my favorite authors and is one I consider to be among the elite of today's thriller writers. This author is nowhere nearly as well known as he should be, and he deserves to be widely read by anyone who is fan of thrillers, books of mystery and suspense and, hell, just a well-written book of any type. Montanari has written five thrillers in the past eleven years but it wasn't until his excellent book, The Rosary Girls, that he started to get the recognition he so richly deserves. The Rosary Girls was one of the best books I read in quite awhile. So, when his latest book, The Skin Gods, was recently released, I couldn't wait to buy it. I was a little concerned, however, that it might not be able to match the reading pleasure I got from The Rosary Girls. My concern was totally unwarranted, as The Skin Gods, which features the same two exceptionally well-developed homicide detectives as in The Rosary Girls, proved in every way to be able to provide the same level of edge-of-the-seat suspense and excitement. The Skin Gods is the story of a madman, called The Actor, who is carefully re-creating Hollywood's most famous and gruesome death scenes. Do yourself a big favor and get aboard the "Montanari Express." The Skin Gods can definitely be read and enjoyed as a "stand alone," but I think you'll enjoy it even more if you first read The Rosary Girls. Once aboard, I'd suggest you read his earlier books as well -- Deviant Way, The Violet Hour and Kiss of Evil. Enjoy the ride!

Having read all the very positive reviews of The Hundredth Man, Jack Kerley's debut book, I was antipicating a thrilling, exciting reading experience. The basic premise involves what would you do to stop a killer? How many lives would you compromise to protect someone you love? These questions haunt Carson Ryder, the homicide detective protagonist, who is forced to confront not only his family's past in order to catch a killer, but also sacrifice his own future. While this premise is usually &quot;right up my alley,&quot; it turned out to be anything but that. My dislike for this book is so strong that I consider it to be one of the worst - if not the worst - book I've read in quite some time. Do yourself a major favor and avoid this way over the top, ridiculous book. Kerley's writing style is awful which quickly caused me to lose interest in the plot and his characters, many of which come off as cartoonish and unbelievable. Kerley has to learn that constantly using words in triplicate to create emotion and/or excitement(e.g.&quot;Please,please, please&quot;, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you&quot;, &quot;Whisk, whisk, whisk&quot;, etc.)is amateurish, boring and tedious. While in other debut books I did not like much overall, I usually felt the author showed enough potential to consider reading his next book. However, there was nothing about The Hundredth Man that makes me even remotely interested in wanting to read Kerley's next effort. It took almost all of my effort just to finish this disappointing book. I know that I am running the risk of receiving a 'not helpful' rating from you with this review (which many readers frequently give to negative reviews). If this happens, it happens, but my concern is in advising you not to make the same mistake I did in terms of time and money. If you are interested in reading a very good debut thriller and an equally good second work by an excellent, yet (at this point) little known writer named Howard Roughan, I'd highly recommend &quot;The Up And Comer&quot; and &quot;The Promise Of A Lie&quot;, respectively.

Up Country is a book that succeeds in many ways by providing: very interesting and strongly developed characters, a tension-laced plot (although this is not a story that is driven by suspense and action), a highly educational perspective of Vietnam from both a contemporary and historical perspective, and humor via the biting, sarcastic thoughts and comments of the main character, Paul Brenner (who was the protagonist in DeMille's book, The General's Daughter).I know that many of those critical of Up Country found it to be more of a travelogue of a veteran's return to Vietnam 30 years after the war than the type of thriller you've come to expect from DeMille. To some degree I agree with the thoughts about the book seeming like a travelogue, but I very much enjoyed the "trip" and consider it to be a memorable one. I expect that DeMille plans a sequel to Up Country, and I'm ready to sign up for the experience right now. If you're ready for a somewhat different type of book from DeMille, I think you'll highly enjoy Up Country and consider it to be one of his more memorable works.

In typical David Baldacci fashion, The Simple Truth is a story that holds your interest from beginning to end. While Baldacci's books are not great literature, they always are interesting, exciting and fun to read. The Simple Truth is Baldacci's best book since Absolute Power. If you're looking for a book that will provide you with true &quot;escape reading&quot;, you won't be disappointed in The Simple Truth... and that's the simple truth!

While I was sorry to see that Jake Grafton has been replaced as the hero in Coonts' latest book, Liars And Thieves, the author takes you on a thrill-a-minute ride that should only be read with your seat belt on. Tommy Carmellini, the new hero (who has appeared as a minor character in Coonts' Cuba) is a smart, talented, witty, CIA agent and ex-burglar who will likely become as popular as Jake Grafton. Liars And Thieves provides enough action and excitement to leave you gasping for breath and wanting to turn the pages as fast as you can. My only criticism is that on a few occasions the plot required me to stretch my limits of credulity a bit too much. Putting this minor flaw aside, the plot, which involves Carmellini helping a beautiful ex-girlfriend who is being blackmailed and of his being asked by the CIA to investigate a massacre at a safe house that was (supposedly) protecting a former KGB archivist who defected with important secret files. is a book Coonts fans and fans of suspense thrillers in general should enjoy very much.

The Citizen Nighthawk has many useful features, such as the ability to do pilot calculations (since it is a pilot's watch), slide rule calculations, division, tip calculations, dual-time capability, date, operates by a solar cell thus excluding the need for a battery, large luminous hands and markers for readability and low-light visibility, and so on. However, my main reasons for buying this watch are because it looks great on the wrist for both casual and evening wear, it is very comfortable to wear despite its large size and it is very durable and reliable. You can be sure that once you start wearing the Citizen Nighthawk you'll have people coming up to you to compliment on your eye-catching watch.

Over the years I've been a fan of William Bayer's books and particularly his Janek mysteries. However, Mirror Maze is definitey a book to skip. The plot was much too disjointed, the characters (even Janek in thsi book) were mostly uninteresting and not very credible, and the action was too sporadic to make me care much about what was going to happen next. I felt like I was in a maze reading this book and all I wanted to do was get out of it so I can move on to my next book. Finally, I took the easy way out and gave up on the book about 2/3s of the way through it.

I've enjoyed some of Haig's othe books but my strong recommendation to you is to skip this book. While the basis of the plot is established very early on, the plot mostly drags and drags and, oh yeah, drags. By the time I made my way through two-thirds of the book I was getting progressively weary of the main character's (MAJ Sean Drummonds's) non-stop wise-cracks and little of interest occurring at a fast enough pace to maintain my attention. It seems that Haig used The Kingmaker more as a vehicle to show how clever/amusing he can be through the main character, moreso than to create a fast-paced entertaining thriller. This is a similar problem I had recently in reading Nelson DeMille's Wild Fire with his wise-ass main character, John Corey. I found myself going from reading every word to skimming through the pages. While it pains me to say it, The Kingmaker may be a dealbreaker for me in regards to reading other books by Haig. Although things do eventually happen, I found the plot to be predictable and too slow-moving. The main challenge I associated with this book was to see if I had the determination to finish it. Ultimately, however, the book got the better of me and I had to give up on it about three-quarters of the way through. There are just too many books and not enough time to read them. Do yourself a favor -- don't be duped (as I was) by the other favorable reviews and skip this book.

I've had The First Counsel for years but put off reading it until recently due to the many average or worse ratings it has received from Amazon reviewers. Having just finished this book, I was pleasantly surprised by its being much more deserving than the 3-star rating it, on average, has received on this web site. The First Counsel, which involves how a date with the president's daughter draws a young lawyer working in the President Counsel Office into a web of extortion, scandal and murder, will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of the book. Its plot is very supenseful, contains many twists and surprises. The characters are interesting and pretty well described, although at times a bit unrealistic -- particularly due to the naivete of the main character, Philip Garrick, and the over-the-top behavior of Nora, the President's daughter. Noneheless, this criticism was not a major problem for me as it appeared to be for many other reviewers of this book. To me, the action and suspense moved the story along at such a quick pace that I was easily able to overlook these flaws. Up until the last 50 pages or so I was prepared to give The First Counsel a 5-star rating. However, without going into any detail as to why, I found the ending, while not disappointing, to be not quite up to the standard of suspense and excitement Meltzer had created up to that point. If you like books in the style of James Patterson, David Baldacci and Harlan Coben, I think you will enjoy The First Counsel. I know I did.

With his seventh book, Blood Memory, Iles continues to enhance his reputation as a writer of intellgent, compelling, suspenseful thrillers that keep you riveted to the page. While all of his books are well-worth reading, Blood Memory ranks at the top of the list, along with The Quiet Game and Mortal Fear. Without giving away the plot details, Blood Memory is an engrossing, gripping story of childhood sexual abuse and the phychological concept of repressed memory. What makes this book (as well as his others) rise well above the pack of thrillers is not just that Iles provides an intelligent, thought-provoking story that has edge-of-your seat excitement. His even greater strengths are: (1) his ability to develop intense multi-dimensional characters that, even with their flaws, you really care about, and (2) his deep knowledge of the subject matter he is writing about combined with his ability to describe it in a style that the reader can learn from and find interesting. Be warned that the subject matter of Blood Memory is disturbing and not for the squeamish. Be assured, however, that once you start this book you'll be in the hands of a top-notch author who'll soon become one of your favorites. Enjoy!

Contagion had been sitting in my bookcase unread since I obtained a proof of it in 1996. I decided to read it now because the movie reviews of Contagion were pretty good and I knew I'd never read the book if I had gone to see the movie first.My decision was a huge mistake since the book was -- in a word -- awful.It's not that the plot was so bad, which involves forensic pathologist Jack Stapleton suspecting that three different very rare diseases responsible for the deaths of several people at a New York hospital is more than just coincidence. While the plot is highly implausible and requires the reader to stretch their willingness-to-believe to the limit, the book does move along at a decent enough pace. What made this book so bad for me was that Cook's ability to create believable, richly developed characters and dialogue that real people would speak was virtually non-existent. The characters were so one-dimensional,cartoon-like and unrealistic, and the dialogue was so cliche-ridden and ridiculous, that I frequently found myself thinking that the influenza that killed several characters in the book couldn't be any more painful than the pain reading this book produced. What I am asking myself now is: Why did I finish this book if I thought it was so bad? Could I be a glutton for punishment?I don't think so.Despite my problems with the plot, character development and dialogue, I continued reading because I wanted to see what happened in the end. Reading the last 75 pages was the "straw that broke the camel's back" for me. While there was a bit of a surprising twist toward the end, the way Cook wrapped up this book was extremely poor and unrealistic. So poor, that the odds of any of the other unread books by Robin Cook in my bookcase ever being read are about the same as the cause for the influenza outbreak described in Contagion becoming reality.

Black Water Transit is like many thrillers -- interesting enough to finish but forgettable right after finishing them. Stroud's plot is interesting but not particularly memorable, and the same applies to his characters. While Black Water Transit is entertaining, I couldn't develop a strong sense of caring about what was to happen and to whom it was to happen. As a result, I often found myself checking to see how many pages I had left so that I could move on to my next book. Overall, I wouldn't recommend that you rush out to read Black Water Transit. On the other hand, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you do decide to read it. For me, reading Black Water Transit was like chewing a piece of gum --the taste while chewing it is familiar and enjoyable, but because the taste is similar to most other pieces I've chewed, it becomes forgettable soon after experiencing it.

To-date it seems that Greg Iles is incapable of writing a bad book. With that said, True Evil -- as was also true about Iles's previous book, Turning Angel -- while being a page-turner, is far from being among his best. The basic plot and main characters are interesting and well-developed. The plot revolves around an ingenious plan to kill your spouse and get away with it. There is lots of action and suspense, although when all is said and done, the conclusion is largely predictable. Further, at a little over 500 pages, True Evil is bloated with excessive dialog. True Evil was definitely good enough to hold my attention and was worth reading. However, I wouldn't recommend that you rush out and add it to your 'must read' list. Although Iles' last two books aren't among his best books, Iles still remains one of my favorite authors and, as usual, I'll be one of the first of his fans to buy his next book.

Steve Samuel is off to a good start in his first book, Rock, Paper, Scissors, but he's not quite ready to be in the top-tier of suspense/thriller writers. The plot is fast-moving, exciting and has lots of action. However, too frequently the action is predictable with not many real surprises. Furhter, without going into detail, several of the characters and some of the plot twists, while interesting, were too over the top and contrived for my taste. Nonetheless, Rock, Paper, Scissors is worth reading and Samuel is an author worth watching, but I'd recommend that this book is one to wait for until it comes out in paperback or to take from the library.

In just his second novel, Howard Roughan is fast estabishing himself as one of the better writers in the mystery/thriller genre. Roughan's writing style is easy and fun to read, his characters are well-developed, credible and (mostly)likable, and his plot is exciting, suspenseful and filled with surprises. The Promise Of A Lie will keep you glued to the pages to see what happens next. I'd highly recommend this book to you!

While Grisham's latest wasn't bad enough to give up on, he has hit an all-time low with The Broker. The plot (if you want to call the weak, loosely connected story line a plot) is poorly developed, the characters have no depth to them, and the ending (as well as most of the rest of the book) is boring. Rather than being (supposedly) a suspense thriller, The Broker reads more like an historical travelogue of Bologna, Italy and a Berlitz course on learning Italian, which is fairly interesting and the only reason I am not giving this book a 1-star rating. I've read and enjoyed to varying degrees virtually all of Grisham's books, even those that were heavily panned by many reader reviewers. However, The Broker is an almost complete waste of valuable reading time. It seems clear from the ending of The Broker that Grisham has a sequel in mind. Next time, he won't have me (and my money) to support him. Do yourself a major favor and skip this book.

I have been a huge fan of Deaver's books since The Bone Collector. However, despite repeated efforts to get into The Cold Moon, I had to give up on it after only a third of the way through. For as long as I was able to stay with The Cold Moon, I found, atypical of Deaver's other Lincoln Rhyme books, the bad guys to be one-dimensional and uninteresting, the plot to be slow-moving and filled with excessive detail about the "science" involved in the investigation, there was too little action and the action that did occur was somewhat unbelievable and convoluted, and that Deaver provided nothing new in terms of developing the relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs. Perhaps if I had the patience to continue reading The Cold Moon my opinion would have been different; but after reading many of the other Amazon reader reviews, I didn't hold out much hope. Thus, given that I have so many books and so little time to read them, I decided to put The Cold Moon aside and move on to my next book. I'm still a Deaver fan and will read his next book -- but for the first time, I have been disappointed in a Lincoln Rhyme mystery.

I'm usually a big fan of mob-related novels so I was looking forward to reading this book, which received a very favorable review from Publishers Weekly. However, Bad Guys was a major league disappointment. The basic plot about a cop that infiltrated the mob in Chicago has been done many times before and done better. The characters are stereotypical, one-dimensional (at best), somewhat cartoon-like and lack credibility. The only character that Izzi created that I cared anything about and that had evoked some sort of emotional reaction was the dog, Sparky. If this isn't enough criticism, the plot was very predictable. Do yourself a favor and skip this book.

In The Confessor, Silva, as in The Kill Artist and The English Assassin, calls on his art restorer/Israeli spy-assassin, Gabriel Allon, to investigate the murder of a long-time friend and fellow spy. As part of his investigation, he uncovers a conspiracy within the Vatican pertaining to the Holocaust, which is where the real plot begins and compelling suspense builds and builds right up to its bullets flying, bodies dying ending. While Silva once again relies on what has become a successful formula for him, The Confessor kept me engrossed throughout the book. However, for me, what really made this book rise to the top of its genre is the very interesting, thought-provoking and controversial perpsective Silva provides on the Vatican's involvement (or lack thereof) during the Holocaust. I've enjoyed all of Silva's books very much and I'd consider The Confessor to be the best of the three featuring Gabriel Allon. Regardless of your personal viewpoint about the controversial subject on which the plot is based, The Confessor is a novel of slow-building but non-stop tension and suspense that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!

Beware! Once you start reading Derailed be prepared for your life to be derailed until you finish it. Simply stated, Derailed is about an ad executive who makes one stupid mistake that derails his (and others) whole life. The word to summarize this book is &quot;great.&quot; Great writing style (in ways it will remind you of James Patterson's style but Siegel is a MUCH better writer), great characters, and great plot. If that's not enough, Derailed is chock full of suspense and excitement. And if that's still not enough, it's filled with surprises that will keep you guessing and panting for breath right up to the last page. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a book that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. I had previously planned to read Harlan Coben's new book (No Second Chance) as my next book, but I enjoyed Derailed so much that I've gotten a copy of James Siegel's first book, Epitaph, and am going to start it right after writing this review.

Alex Berenson has created a tension-mounting debut thriller that takes readers inside the war on terror in a riveting manner that will keep the pages flying through your fingers. The Faithful Spy features John Wells, who is the first American CIA agent ever to penetrate al Qaeda. Since before the attack on 9/11, Wells has been hiding in the mountains of Pakistan, biding his time, building his cover. Finally, on the order of an al Qaeda leader who is planning more attacks on America, Wells is coming home. But can Wells's CIA superiors still trust him after being away for so long -- especially since Wells has become a Muslim and now finds the US decadent and shallow? Berenson provides the answers to this and many other mysteries in a well-written, exciting and very true-to-life manner. Further, Berenson has created characters that are believable and interesting; and John Wells is a character I'll definitely be wanting to go along with on his future adventures (although I'll let him do all the "heavy work"; I'll just turn the pages). I won't go into the details of the plot, but I will say that the pace of the plot provides a steadily increasing level of tension and results in a powerful, gripping ending. The Faithful Spy has some very minor flaws, but these really aren't worth describing. For me, The Faithful Spy managed to be as affecting in its personal stories as it is sophisticated in its political detail. If you're a fan of Vince Flynn or Daniel Silva or of good spy thrillers in general, The Faithful Spy is a book I think you'll very much want to read. Enjoy!

While some reviewers felt that the first 90-100 pages were slow moving, I found that I did not want to put this book down from the very first page. Icarus is one of those rare books that the less you know about before starting it, the more exciting, surprising and suspenseful it will be to you. While I know it's hard to spend money on a book without knowing what it's about, this is definitely a book that should be the exception to the rule. The style of writing is very easy to read, the plot is very fast-paced, the action is non-stop (particularly in the second half of the book), and the characters are very credible. If this isn't enough to motivate you to put Icarus at the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list, than maybe this will do it for you -- you won't guess who the killer is. Even if you do, it won't be until towards the very end of the book, and by that point you'll have probably gone through a list of characters who you thought &quot;did it.&quot; Icarus is the most enjoyable thriller I've read in quite a while. Do yourself two favors -- 1) don't read any reviews that describe the plot, and 2) go right out and get a copy of Icarus (and don't be tempted to read the inside flap. It will take away from some of the suspense!). Also, if you have a little more money to spend, get a copy of Russell Andrews' first book, Gideon.

The Mayor Of Lexington Avenue, the debut novel by James Sheehan, involves trial lawyer Jack Tobin who is determined to repay a debt to his childhood friend -- the man who dubbed him "The Mayor of Lexington Avenue" -- when a young Florida man is convicted of murder. The first half of this book is quite strong and well-developed. However, its second half steadily deteriorates when Tobin and his cohorts become the central figures in the plot to correct the wrongs that were done. During this phase of the book, Sheehan demonstrates his inexperience as a novelist. Most of his characters are thinly developed, their exploits are often unrealistic and contrived, his technique at foreshadowing serves to make many of the intended surprise elements too predictable, and the dialogue he has his characters speak is often cliche-ridden and corny. Hopefully, Sheehan has improved his writing skills and corrected these flaws in his second book, The Law Of Second Chances.

I read the first book in Ablow's series, Denial, featuring Dr. Frank Clevenger in the mid-late '90s. I liked Denial but not enough to read Projection, the second book in the series, until now. My feeling about both of these books is the same -- fast reading, lots of suspense, off-center characters and gruesome violence. In most cases, for me, these are the ingredients for giving a thriller a 4-star or 5-star rating. So, why I am considering Projection to be a good book, but nothing special, and giving it a 3 1/2-star rating? The basic reason for this has to do primarily with Ablow's writing style; in that I felt I was "reading an account" of the suspense that occurs, rather than being able to feel that I was "right there experiencing it" with the characters. Another factor that probably contributed to my not rating Projection higher was that I allowed too much time to go by from when I read Denial. My strong recommendation if you decide to read Projection is to read Denial first. Otherwise, I don't think you'll understand well enough the angst and motivations of the main character and some of the other characters that were first introduced in Denial; which, in turn, is likely have a negative impact on your enjoyment of Projection.

From the time that Billy Wiles finds (on page 14) an anonymous note on his windshield his life is turned upside down. You, as the reader, will also find your normal life put on hold, as you won't be able to put this book down. With Velocity, Koontz returns to the top echelon of thriller writers. Velocity provides not only a fast-paced, nail-biting, suspenseful storyline, it contains characters that are very well-developed and multi-dimensional. The main character, Billy Wiles, who on the surface seems like an ordinary, hardworking guy, is one that you'll remember for a long time. I've enjoyed many of Koontz's books over the years and Velocity ranks very near the top -- second only to Watchers, Intensity and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. Velocity is definitely worth reading but --beacause of its slightly disappointing ending -- is not worthy of a 5-star rating. My feeling is similar to one of the other reviewers who felt that because the plot was so strong, no ending would have been satisfying enough.

If you enjoy/enjoyed the old-school crime novels with characters like Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade, you'll enjoy March Violets, which is set in Berlin in 1936 and features tough-talking, hard-drinking, chain-smoking and cynical Bernhard Gunther. Gunther is an ex-cop, now private investigator hired by a rich businessman to find some jewelry that was stolen, and which had belonged to the businessman's recently murdered daughter. In addition, Gunther is "requested" by Herman Goering to find some important missing papers. I found Kerr's description of prewar Berlin and life in Nazi Germany to be very good, and considered the plot to be engrossing. These two elements are worthy of a 4- 4 1/2 star rating. What brought my overall rating of March Violets down to 3 1/2 stars is that I found that Kerr went somewhat overboard in portraying Gunther's tough guy attitude and in having Gunther speak ad nauseum in cliches. At times, I felt that Kerr was trying to create a satire of the type of detective novels that were popular in the '30s, '40s and '50s. March Violets is a good book that held my attention, and created enough interest to make me want to read the next book in Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy. However, unless you are a lover of crime noir books, March Violets is not a book that I'd recommend you rush out to buy and put at the top of your To Be Read list.

The Pale Criminal is the second book in Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy featuring Bernie Gunther, a tough-talking, hard-drinking, chain-smoking, cynical ex-cop, now private detective. The Pale Criminal takes place in 1938 Germany (mostly Berlin) and has Gunther working a case involving the murder of several teeange German girls. The Kripo (police) are unable to make progress in the case and Gunther is "requested" by Reinhard Heydrich, second in importance in the SS only to Heinrich Himmler, to temporarily rejoin the Kripo to take charge of the investigation. The interesting, though at times slow moving, plot reveals that some members of the Nazi party want to use the multiple murders to further incite anti-Jewish feelings. I found Kerr's description of pre-war Berlin and life in Nazi Germany to be engrossing, and it made me feel like I was right there experiencing the tension that permeated life in these times. The Pale Criminal is a good book that held my attention, and created enough interest to make me eager to read the third book in Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy.

As usual, John Nance is the master when he describes an airline disaster. Unfortunately, in Blackout his characters are so poorly developed and, in particular, his dialogue rings SO untrue that they completely outweigh the suspense Nance tries to maintain throughout the book. Usually I am not that critical of these factors as long as the plot is very strong. This is definitely not the case in Blackout. As a matter of fact, because of these factors I had to give up on this book with over 100 pages still to go. Save yourself from this disaster and thrill yourself with another book! I'd highly recommned Peter Blauner's Man Of The Hour.

Robert Mrazek's The Deadly Embrace is an excellent fast-paced thriller in which WWII-ravaged London just prior to the period of the invasion of Normandy is the backdrop for a search for a ruthless killer. Beyond Mrazek's ability to tell an exciting tale of suspense and intrigue, his special strengths are the ability to provide richly developed,very credible characters and to describe this period in history as if you, yourself, were right there with these interesting characters experiencing all the goings on. The Deadly Embrace deserves a much wider reading audience than it has attained to date. Hopefully, after reading this review you'll read this very enjoyable book and help Mrazek develop the reader base he deserves. I'm looking forward to Mrazek's next book.

Muirel Gray's Furnace grabbed my attention quickly and held it captive through the first quarter of the book. Unfortunately, I found my attention waning during the second and third quarters, as the story moved too slowly for my taste and introduced some sub-plots that were somewhat disjointed and/or uninteresting. Gray did manage to recapture some of my attention and interest in the final quarter of the book but by this point I was as much interested in finishing it so I could move on to my next book as in finding out how the story ends. Furnace could easily have been an &quot;8&quot; or possibly a &quot;9&quot; with some necessary editing.

I've enjoyed many of Christopher Hyde's books and so I bought his latest, An American Spy, on the strength of his reputation alone. However, much to my disappointment, An American Spy could not maintain my interest. The plot took much too long to develop, the main characters were not very interesting, the dialogue was a bit unrealistic and the thrills did not come fast enough and were somewhat tepid. The only enjoyable aspect of the book for me pertained to Hyde's description of England during WWII, which served as the backdrop for the story involving the murder of an American officer and unsettling implications of treason by a band of U,S. soldiers. As a result, I soon developed a 'who cares' attitude and ultimately gave up on the book about two-thirds of the way into it. If you are interested in historical fiction I'd recommend Chritopher Hyde's The Second Assasin and Wisdom Of The Bones.
