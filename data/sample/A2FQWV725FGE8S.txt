In this classic tale written in 1850, N. Hawthorne tells the tragic tale of a fallen woman, Hester Prynne. In his essay entitled "The Custom House", the author pretends to have found a mysterious relic of cloth in the shape of the letter along with a manuscript in which a certain Jonathan Pue described the letter's wearer.Thus the character of Hester Prynne was born, this adulteress who has to wear the shameful letter A embroidered on her garment in scarlet letter and insolent gold thread. Her error is adultery and the Puritan magistrates of colonial Boston decided that she should wear the bright letter affixed to her breath. In the opening scene, Hester is standing dishonoured before the town holding another man's child just as her long-lost husband Roger Chillinworth arrives in Boston. The story is tightly constructed and takes place in 24 chapters with the action in the first, the twelfth and the last revolving around the scaffold on which Hester suffers her punishment. The structure is taught and essentially limited to the description of the three adult characters of Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth, each in turn wearing various masks to hide themselves from the failures of the human heart. Hester never reveals her lover's identity thus protecting her from public disgrace but not from his interior sense of guilt. At any rate she is a strong character, a rebel dwelling in solitude which grants her freedom of thought, particularly concerning the fate of women: "The world's law was no law for her mind" the author writes. To the reader she appears as a fascinating creature, captivating, rebellious, even intimidating. The d&eacute;nouement is equally startling. After Hester's daughter Pearl marries, she returns to the small abandoned cottage and resumes her former life, not being able to remain an expatriate, the scarlet letter now voluntarily clamped to her bosom as if it were part of her true identity. Her triumph finally lies in her willingness to take up the mark that identifies her as a woman.

George Orwell depicts a horrible totalitarian state that suppresses all opposition. In 1984 the world is divided into three parts, Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. These three parts are constantly at war. The charismatic figure of Big Brother stands in the forefront of the Party. It is a figure of mythical power. Winston Smith struggles against the Party, he rebels against Big Brother and the totalitarian regime. But his rebellion will result in his own destruction. We should bare in mind that this novel was published in 1949 and we so realise that Orwell's imaginary future world is a brilliant creation, his vision of brutalised and manipulated humanity is gripping and unfortunately still supremely relevant.

In this short novel, Steinbeck chose two main characters. They are two wandering labourers, George Milton and Lennie Small. The former is the more intelligent one, a small and strong man with sharp features. The latter is rather a simpleton with a huge body and a shapeless face and he moves his feet like a bear moves its paws.They both dream of saving enough money to buy their own modest farm but because Lennie is both clumsy and strong he always manages to get involved in some mischief wherever he can find some work. So George has to keep a constant vigil on Lennie - particularly when there are women around - in order to avoid disaster.Steinbeck's remarkable achievement is to show in a short novel the pathetic way of life of two simple minded men and that of peasants in general in rural America in the 1930s. The dialogues are a delight to read because the author renders the characters' accent so accurately.

The novel has ist origins in the author's own experiences of mining and harvesting in the Peleponnesus in the 1920s. The narrator's adventures are exhilarating and havoc-making. If you like a humorous adventure set in the beautiful landscapes of unforgettable Greece, this is the book to read.

Mrs Bront tells the tale of Agnes Grey, a young governess of a little over 20 and her experience working for two families, The Bloomfields and their 3 children Tom, Mary Ann and Fanny, and with the Murrays and their two daughters Mathilda and Rosalie.In writing her first novel, Mrs Bront must have drawn from her own experiences in 1839 when she worked for the Ingham family at Blake Hall and from 1840 till 1845 with the Robinsons at Thorp Green Hall. As her sister Charlotte sated, this personal experience lies behind many of the characters and events as well as Agnes's feelings in the novel.As a first novel, it show an astonishing maturity and technical accomplishment since "Agnes Grey" is in many ways a very personal story. Mrs Bront describes as vividly as possible the strong pressures that a governess' life involved at that time - the isolation, the frustrations, the insensitive treatment of employers and their families. Actually it transpires in this novel that middle-class households used to consider a governess as little more than a servant thus undervaluing her role as an educator. And the author's view of such households is sharply cynical: they are self-satisfied, vulgar, small-minded snobs who delight in social pretension. They are mercilessly depicted in their moral emptiness and Agnes actually suffers from moral isolation which becomes more and more oppressive and alienating, especially during her stay with the Murrays. In this family Agnes feel deprived from ordinary human kindness and warmth of affection so much so that she falls into depression because she feels that her moral identity is being destroyed, no longer confident in her "distinctions of right and wrong".A remarkable novel about a young woman and such issues as moral behaviour, moral responsibility and individual integrity.

Mrs Lessing continues telling the story of Mara and Dann whom we left at the Farm in Ifrik in "Mara and Dann". Dann soon returns to the Centre together with Griot - who had been a soldier under General Dann back in Agre - Ali, her daughter Tamar and the snow dog called Ruff. They plan to rescue as many refugees from the south as possible and turn them into the Red Blanket army. At the Centre, they assemble all the technical knowledge left there by the long extinct civilisations of Yerrup because the place is slowly sinking into the marshland. Finally they make their way for a city in the Tundra where they hope to set up a community based on the knowledge the scribes and savants studied and collected at the Centre.It is a slightly disappointing sequel to "Mara and Dann" which lacks the latter's intensity because the plot is sluggish and less like the adventure the reader enjoyed in the first novel.

In this widely read novel, Mr Huxley portrays a world as it could be far in the future. The World Controllers have created the perfect society with strict regulations ensuring that human beings lead an ideal and happy life. Through the use of genetic engineering, brainwashing, sex end the "soma" drug, all the members of this utopian society are happy consumers. Yet some very few people have a pressing urge to question the whole system. Bernard Marx for instance can't help having a feeling of discontent, harbouring a desire for solitude and a distaste for the pleasures of promiscuity. He has a longing to break free. Perhaps a visit to one of the remaining Savage Reservations where the old and imperfect life has been preserved will be the cure for Bernard's distress.In the same vein, readers may enjoy H.G. Wells's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" or Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451".

In the third part of "The Cairo Trilogy", life of the Abd al-Jawad family goes on. Amina's body now withered, her hair white, ill health and grief having altered her considerably. Her diligence and her capacity for running the household are now gone. She no longer pays attention to her home except for the services to her husband al-Sayyid Ahmad, once a vigorous man in full swing. He now suffers from high blood pressure and he had to give up many of the pleasures of life - drinks, women and good food. In fact, many months before dying, he is completely bedridden, a particularly humiliating situation for a man with such a strong ego.Here Mr Mahfouz casts a compassionate glance at the irony of life which makes elderly people become utterly dependant on others, as they used to be when they were infants. For Kamal, now thirty-six, it is sad to see his family age, all the more since he refuses to get married and thus spends a lot of time aloof and lonely. Aiming at becoming a true intellectual, Kamal often collides with doubt and struggles with instincts and passions and is becoming "an emotionally crippled recluse". He often broods about his youth, his love for Ada and the eternal loss of the enchanting past.But there are also reasons to rejoice as the younger generation takes over and ascends in society. Marriages take place, careers are planned. Mr Mahfouz splendidly portrays this cycle of life in which the old generation gives way to the boisterous and cheerful young one. This is shown in the moving final scene when Kamal and his brother Yasin enter a store where the former buys several items for his daughter's baby while the latter buys a black necktie he will need when the mournful day of his mother's death arrives...

Ethan Frome is a farmer in Starkfield, Massachusetts, at the beginning of the 20th century. He is unhappily married to Zenobia (Zeena), a suspicious, hypochondriac, bitter, narrow-minded, ignorant and discontented woman. He is strongly attracted to Zeena's cousin Mattie Silver who shares their household and is entrusted with all the chores which Zeena refuses to do. Ethan's tragic fate begins when Zeena peremptorily decides that they need a "hired girl" which would of course imply Mattie's departure since the Fromes don't have the means to employ two girls.A novel of great intensity with its slow developing tragedy and characters plunging towards their destiny. The author's masterful economy of language vividly renders the oppressive "silent ache" that permanently hinders communication between Ethan and Zeena. The vision of the three main characters is done in an almost cinematic way as they are trapped indoors in the severe Massachusetts winter. The narrative pattern is original too since the whole plot is told by an unnamed narrator who met the taciturn Ethan many years after the events he is about to tell us. The reader has moments of doubt when the narrator tells a story in all details and long passages of dialogue he could not possibly have known or heard during his meeting with Ethan. But Edith Wharton's extraordinary craft makes the story break away from the contingencies of the frame and it comes to moving life for the reader. A superb novel, one of the finest and most intense narratives in the history of American literature.

Arthur Rowe, a retired journalist, is the unlikely winner of a cake, the weight of which he correctly guessed during a charity fte patronized by The Free Mothers. For Rowe, the fte should have been an innocent trip back to childhood and innocence, a welcome chance to escape the terror of the Blitz and to forget twenty years of his past as a murderer. Instead he becomes a haunted man because he possesses a cake which was destined for somebody else. It turns out that the cake contains some poison - hyoscine - which nearly kills an innocent man called Poole. Then Rowe is involved in a s&eacute;ance with Mrs Bellairs, a fortune teller, and several other people during which a man called Cost is killed with Rowe's own knife. He manages to escape with the help of Willi Hilfe, an Austrian refugee. Next Rowe is accosted by a man called Fullove who specialises in eighteenth century landscape gardening books and who asks Rowe to help him carry his heavy suitcase to the Regal Court and to leave it there in the room of a certain Travers. A page guides Rowe to Mr Travers's room where Anna, Willi Hilfe's sister, is waiting. Soon after that, Rowe and Anna open the suitcase which contains no books but a bomb which goes off...At this stage - the middle of the novel - the plot does not seem to make much sense but in the second part Mr Greene carefully assembles the pieces of the jigsaw so that by the end of the narrative the reader has a clear picture of the mystery. Reading the novel one realizes that war is like a bad dream in which familiar people appear in terrible and unlikely disguises and that nobody is to be trusted. That is the Ministry of Fear, the general atmosphere spread by the enemy so that one can't depend on a single soul. And then there is that other Ministry of Fear to which all who love belong since if one loves, one fears at the same time.

This is the story of the Gabalawi family. Gabalawi disowns his son Idris in favour of Adam and then puts the latter to the test. The children of the alley are all the people living in the Gabalawi Alley where Gabalawi is the ancestor who owns everything and everybody in the desert around it.We meet Adham, Gabal, Rifan, Quassem and Arafa who each in their own way fight the injustice and the gangsters in the alley in order to free their fellow citizens from bondage and tyranny. But after each individual victory it inevitably turns out that the children of the alley fall back again into greed, corruption, crime and poverty while just a few enjoy wealth and power.In this sense this is a powerful and daring narrative which teaches us a lot about the spiritual history of humankind. A powerful fable and a richly told story which embraces in its plot not only the world of the Middle East but the world itself.

A Raindeer airplane crashes in Labrador after a little less than 1440 flying hours. In the official report the accident is ascribed to pilot error but Denis Scott at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough is not convinced that this explanation is true. Neither does Theodore Honey, a slightly eccentric member of Scott's staff, who has an as yet unproved theory that the tail plane of the Raindeer is bound to succumb to metal fatigue after 1440 hours in the air. What if Honey's experiments prove him to be right?

In this novel, Mr Mahfouz chose to show simple characters living in an area similar to that of his own birth. The richly colourful life of these people is carefully drawn and the story crowds with minor charcters depicted with keen perception and great humour. There is Uncle Kamil the sweet seller, Abbas the barber, Kirsha the caf&eacute; owner, "Dr" Boosh the dentist, Radwan Hussainy the landlord, Sheikh Darwish the former English teacher, Umm Hamida the mariage broker, Salim Alwan the company owner, Husniya and Jaada the bakers, Zaita the cripple maker and Ibrahim Faraj the pimp.We see how they are enticed away from their natural roles by the hopes of material gains chiefly through work with the British Army. The novel examines the problems of behaviour and morality: drug addiction, homosexuality, ambitions and dissatisfactions. Perhaps it is time itself which is the novel's principal character personified by the ageless Alley. The aspirations and tragedies of the inhabitants are witnessed with indifference by Midaq Alley. But in the Alley, as in life itself, there is also a lot of gaiety, colour and excitement to enliven the passing scene.

Mr Goddard's novel is set in England in 1931. Two "unprincipled adventurers who understand the value of nothing except money", Max Wingate and Guy Horton, are returning back to London from America where they used to deal in illegal activities for the past thirteen years. On board the "Empress of Britain" they are introduced to Diana Charnwood, daughter of Fabian Charnwood, head of Charnwood Investments. Since people like Max live by their wits and can never afford to relax completely, Wingate quickly becomes aware that "the man who wheedles his way into Diana Charnwood's affections wheedles his way into a fortune." And indeed, shortly after having been introduced to Diana Charnwood, Max writes the following promissory note: "I hereby undertake to share equally with my good friend Guy Horton all financial proceeds, however and/or actual marriage I contract with Miss Diana Charnwood if and whenever it may occur." Is this note going to be good luck charms or, as Guy soon comes to suspect, the omens of ill fortune?As usual in Mr Goddard's novels, this splendidly old fashioned affair is full of thuggery, cross and double-cross, plot and counter-plot and the reader feels like being on a roller coaster with never ending twists and bends.

Mrs Desai's novel opens with a lady called Lotte fleeing the scene of a murder. She's just lost a close friend, Hugo Baumgartner. When she gets back home, all that is left of Baumgartner's life are a few postcards sent by his mother during the Second World War. The German text on these postcards is always cryptic: &quot;Meine kleine Maus,&quot; &quot;Mein Haschen&quot; &quot;Liebchen...&quot; &quot;Do not worry, my rabbit, I am well. Are you well?&quot; &quot;Keep well, my mouse, and do not worry&quot; &quot;I am well...&quot; and they're signed &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Mutti&quot; or &quot;M&quot;.And so the reader begins to follow Hugo Baumgartner's life, starting with his childhood in Berlin. At the age of about eight, his father, a Jewish furniture retailer, soon loses his business, his store is ransacked by the Nazis and he is taken to a concentration camp. Baumgartner and his mother are forced to leave their beautifully furnished apartment and hide in the former office of the shop. At school, Baumgartner's situation becomes unbearable: his classmates chant to him: &quot;Baumgartner, Baum, hat eine Nase wie ein Daum&quot; (Baumgartner's dumb, has a nose like a thumb.) Eventually, his survival in Germany becoming a matter of days, his mother agrees to Herr Pfuehl's idea to send his son to India, since he has a few connections there in the furniture production business.There are many moving scenes as the reader discovers, along with Hugo, the sights, sounds and smells of Calcutta and Bombay. And moving too, the life of this pathetic and insignificant man Baumgartner who simply does not belong. Neither to Hitler's Germany nor to India's society, where he is a perpetual &quot;firanghi&quot;, foreigner, a wounded survivor.This novel is the achievement of a superior writer with a sharp perception about human nature, loss, solitude.

Throughout this novel, one senses that R. Kipling was a loyal British subject though he was born in Inda. He believed in the imperial authority of his queen and country and his defence of the British rule in India gave rise to controversy at the end of the 18th century. Interestingly enough, as one progresses through "Kim", one feels the author's passion for his beloved India, a country he nevertheless believed should be ruled by white men since, in his view, they are superior. In fact natives are routinely depicted as inferiors but Kipling's racial stereotyping was not outrageous more than a hundred years ago.Like Mowgli in "The Jungle Book", Kimball O'Hara in "Kim" is a self-reliant and resourceful boy called "little friend of the world" and the author perhaps equates the brutal indignities he suffered in his boyhood with the humiliations inflicted upon the natives of India.

In August 1831, in a remote region of south-eastern Virginia, took place the only effective and sustained revolt in the history of American Negro slavery. That year, a black man, Nat Turner, awaits death in a prison cell. He is a slave, a preacher and the leader of the revolt. Mr Styron based his novel on the single significant contemporary document concerning this insurrection, namely a brief pamphlet of twenty pages called &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, published in Richmond in 1831. The confession Turner made to his jailers under the duress of his God is a narrative describing a good man's transformation into an avenging angel even as it encompasses all the betrayals, cruelties and humiliations that made up slavery - and that is still present in the collective psyches of both races.This magnificent book brilliantly depicts the American past in a dazzling narrative.

And so the members of the crew are about to enter the futuristic world of Inteterra.Jules Verne wrote an infinitely more refined book, "Voyage to the Center of the Earth", in 1864!

150 years ago, on the site of the house of the old Pyncheon family in Providence, New England, lived one Mathew Maule in a log-built hut who was executed for the crime of witchcraft. Before dying, Maule uttered a prophecy to Colonel Pyncheon: "God will give him blood to drink."Villagers could not understand that Pyncheon wanted to build his house over the unquiet grave of the dead wizard Maule and why he should prefer this site that had already been accursed in all the vastness of New England. At any rate the house was built in the grotesqueness of Gothic fancy with seven gables pointing sharply to the sky. On the day of the ceremony of consecration of the house, Colonel Pyncheon suddenly died and some said that Maule's prophecy could be heard throughout the house spoken in a loud voice...From father to son, the family clung to the ancestral house with tenacity. Bu Mathew Maule's prophecy seems to have planted a heavy footstep on the conscience of the Pyncheons as though they committed again the guilt of their ancestor thus inheriting a great misfortune.An impressive novel in which an old house itself is the major character. The story is filled with contrasts and oppositions between the dark and gloomy interior of the house and the bright and sunlit exterior. Shadow is the atmosphere of the invisible world of evil, of the past hidden in the recesses of the old mansion. As one follows the lives of Hepzibah, Phoebe and Clifford, one realises that the human fates of the present times are closely linked to the web of the past.

Here is what the author says about his novel:"`The Confidential Agent' was written in six weeks in 1938 after my return from Mexico. The Spanish Civil War furnished the background...I was struggling then through `The Power and the Glory', but there was no money in the book as far as I could foresee. Certainly my wife and two children would not be able to live on one unsaleable book...so I determined to write another "entertainment" as quickly as possible in the mornings, while I ground on slowly with `The Power and the Glory' in the afternoons.The opening scene between two rival agents on the cross-channel steamer--I called them D. and L. because I did not wish to localize their conflict--was all I had in mind, and a certain vague ambition to create something legendary out of a contemporary thriller: the hunted man who becomes in turn the hunter, the peaceful man who turns at bay, the man who has learned to love justice by suffering injustice. But what the legend was to be about in modern terms I had no idea.I fell back for the first and last time in my life on Benzedrine. For six weeks I started each day with a tablet, and renewed the dose at midday. Each day I sat down to work with no idea of what turn the plot might take and each morning I wrote, with the automatism of a planchette, two thousand words instead of my usual stint of five hundred words. In the afternoons `The Power and the Glory' proceeded towards its end at the same leaden pace, unaffected by the sprightly young thing who was so quickly overtaking it.`The Confidential Agent' is one of the few books of mine which I have cared to reread--perhaps because it is not really one of mine. It was as though I were ghosting for another man. D., the chivalrous agent and professor of Romance literature, is not really one of my characters, nor is Forbes, born Furtstein, the equally chivalrous lover. The book moved rapidly because I was not struggling with my own technical problems: I was to all intents ghosting a novel by an old writer who was to die a little before the studio in which I had worked was blown out of existence. All I can say as excuse, and in gratitude to an honoured shade, is that `The Confidential Agent' is a better than Ford Madox Ford wrote himself when he attempted the genre in `Vive Le Roy'".From `Ways of Escape', pp.69-71

Louis Drax is an intelligent and articulate 9 year old child but he has difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction, a "reality problem" as it is described by his psychologist Marcel Perez. Louis and his parents Pierre and Nathalie decide to go on a picnic in the Auvergne one April afternoon. But a row occurs between Pierre and Nathalie because the former considers that Louis is allowed to consume too many sweets. Subsequently, Pierre accuses Nathalie of badly educating their son and menaces to take him to Paris to his mother's. The boy runs away and is chased by his father when he suddenly falls into a ravine. With the help of the gendarmes, Louis is found dead and there is no trace of his father. Two hours later the boy and his distraught mother are brought to Vichy General Hospital, Louis miraculously comes back to life but remains comatose in Dr Philippe Meunier's ward. After that he is transferred to the Clinique de l'Horizon in Provence and placed in the hands of neurologist Dr Pascal Dannachet who specialises in PVS patients (Persistent Vegetative State).Soon Pascal is puzzled by the circumstances of Louis's accident. Not only because his mother is the only witness but also because she now claims that Louis didn't fall into the ravine but was pushed by his father, an alcoholic pilot with Air France. Then two menacing letters are sent to both Nathalie and Pierre in a childish handwriting and signed "Louis". How could a comatose child write these letters, let alone post them? Is it a trick played by his father Pierre? But this possibility is soon ruled out when Pierre's body is found by a group of speleologists in a cave not far from Louis's accident.A fine mystery story in which Mrs Jensen shows that a mother's feelings for her son can be ambivalent, swaying between love and hatred, perhaps because a son is never quite like a mother wishes him to be.

Ibn Fattouma, or Quindil as his father called him, is about to depart for the quest of the land of Gebel, a place considered by many to be a miracle of countries, perfection itself, because the world seems to him loathsomely jaundiced and not to be born or lived in.Quindil's long journey to Gebel will take him to different countries: the land of Mashriq, land of Haira, land of Halba, land of Aman and land of Ghuroub. Each of these countries shows social and political institutions similar to the ones we know, be it a kingdom, a democracy or a totalitarian regime and with much humour Mr Mahfouz depicts in a fairytale like prose the absurdities of each system.The last chapter is called The Beginning because after visiting five lands, Gebel finally comes into view far in the distance on top of the Green Mountain and Quindil is about to ascend its winding path.

In a Swiss sanatorium above lake Z&uuml;rich, Dr Richard (Dick) Diver meets a fascinating young patient, Nicole Warren. Nicole suffers from Divided Personality at its acute down-hill phase which translates in her fear of men because she was the victim of incest after her mother's death.Nicole's state improves after some time at the clinic and Richard marries her. They move to the French Riviera where they live in the glamour provided by Nicole's family money but soon their luck runs out.This novel is Fitzgerald's most personal one if one considers that his own wife Zelda became increasingly troubled with mental illness in the 1930s and so the story of Dick Diver and his schizophrenic wife Nicole shows the pain that the author went through himself. It is the moving account of the collapse of a marriage and an attempt to diagnose the sickness and destruction that money breeds. Dick's final loneliness in the novel reflects Fitzgerald's own dive into drink and despair.

Nora Doyle had two sons: Jonah and Troy. The latter she gave for adoption because she felt too young to raise a child. The novel is constructed like a jigsaw puzzle and the reader slowly becomes acquainted with the various characters. Nora the depressive and suicidal mother, Jonah the unlucky father who is caught in drug dealing and who is refused the custody of his son Loomis and Troy's long search for his lost brother with the help of The PeopleSearch Agency.The characters are extremely well drawn and the author skilfully explores their emotional paths as they all fatally blotch every opportunity they are given. It seems that everything the characters attempt to achieve is doomed to fail. In this sense it is a remarkable novel about failure, oblivion and destruction by apparently everyday minor incidents. It is a claustrophobic tale in which there is not a single destiny which does not go awry. Quite an achievement when one considers that it is Dan Chaon's first novel.

This novel is based on a character whom Somerset Maugham met in Paris in 1897 called Aleistair Crowley. He was a liar, a boastful man and a voluminous writer of mediocre verse. He was also dabbing in Satanism, magic and occult. He inspired Somerset Maugham and served as a model for Oliver Haddo in &quot;The Magician&quot;.Arthur Burdon, surgeon of St Luke's in London, has just arrived in Paris to study the methods of the French operators. But he has also come there to see Margaret Dauncy with whom he is in love. It is Dr Porhoet, a lifetime friend of Arthur's, who introduces him to Oliver Haddo. This obese, fleshy-faced man with an imposing paunch claims to be a magician. At a dinner party, the guests can hardly believe the stories told by this charlatan. They wonder whether he is an impostor or a madman and how much he really believes what he says. Does he deceive himself or is he laughing up his sleeve at the madness of those who take him seriously? To Arthur's bewilderment, as he is about to marry Margaret, she falls under the spell of Oliver Haddo and flees with him. Yet Arthur can hardly picture into what abyss of horror and evil Margaret will be driven.A complex and perceptive novel. The theme of evil is perfectly woven into a story stunning for its action and vivid characters.I recommend the audio version from Audible.com. Listening to Frederick Davidson reading &quot;The Magician&quot; is a pure delight!

All the characters in Muriel Spark's novel are old people. There is Dame Lettie Colson who is pestered - but perhaps it is an illusion - by anonymous telephone calls with a voice saying only "Remember you must die", her brother Godfrey and his wife Charmian who live in a sort of m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois. Their life doesn't get easier as they advance in age: senility and physical decrepitude are handicaps they try to live with, sometimes conscious of them but not always.Then there are the twelve female occupants of the Maud Long Medical Ward, a nursing home, who spend their time gossiping about petty scandals, mostly about wills being rewritten in the favour of another person for some trivial behavioural reason.The plot is both funny and macabre because all the characters are mean, jealous, curious, witty or confused, probably as they used to be all their life. It seems that old age does not transform our character much, for better or for worse.

The head of Christy Marine, Duncan Alexander, plans to build the largest tanker ever designed, the Golden Dawn. He signs a ten-year contract to carry one million ton loads of crude oil from the El Barras field on the south Arabian Gulf to the Orient Amex refinery in Galveston, Texas. The problem is that the design of Golden Dawn is far from flawless and that the El Barras crude has a cadmium sulphite constituent of between 2000 and 40000 parts per million. There has probably never been a more deadly cargo in the history of seafaring. In spite of Nicholas Berg's persistent efforts, nothing can stop Duncan Alexander. The Golden Dawn is about to undertake her voyage from the Arabian Gulf around Good Hope, one of the most dangerous seas of the world with a cargo that could wipe out virtually every creature living in the sea...

Jim Wormold is a vacuum cleaner seller ("Phastcleaners") in Havana. He owns a shop in Lamparilla Street where he lives with his seventeen year old daughter Milly who attends the American Convent School and is a devout Catholic. Among Wormold's acquaintances there is Dr Hasselbacher, an unstable character with a dubious past and the Red Vulture, Captain Segura, who is in love with Milly and wishes to marry her.One day Wormold is approached by Hnery Hawthorne from the British Secret Service who is in the process of "setting up the Caribbean network". Hawthorne proposes to Wormold to do some spying for the Secret Service for a remuneration of $ 150 a month. One of his duties is to recruit agents who will be able to report to him on different matters (political, economic and technological). Wormold takes up Dr Hasselbacher's suggestion to simply invent such agents and so Raoul (an alcoholic Cubana air pilot), Rodriguez (a night club king) and Teresa (a dancer at a striptease place) are the names of "agents" which Wormold communicates to London. Wormold is also supposed to send encoded reports to London but since there is nothing to report, the messages are pure fiction out of his imagination. Wormold even sends the Secret Service plans of supposedly secret weapons, using parts of his vacuum cleaners as a source of inspiration.In a tragicomic tone, Mr Greene shows an innocent man entangled in a web of deceit and crime because he wishes to secure his daughter's financial future. The author is also very critical with the way the people employed by the Secret Service in those days went about their duty. There are hilarious scenes about such amateur agents' navet&eacute; and the way they used to misjudge both the character and the personality of those they recruited seems almost unbelievable. One of Graham Greene's best novels.

In Alice Springs the narrator called Bruce meets Arkady Volchok, an Australian citizen who is mapping the sacred sites of the Aboriginals. Arkady is fascinated by them, by their grit and tenacity and their ways of dealing with white people. Arkady speaks a couple of their languages and he is often astounded by their intellectual vigour, their memory and their capacity to survive.It was during his time as a schoolteacher in Walbiri that Arkadi learned of the labyrinth of invisible pathways which meander all over Australia and are known to Europeans as Songlines - a way for Aboriginals to sing out the name of everything that crosses their path during their wanderings: birds, animals, plants, rocks, waterholes and so sing the world in existence.When a route is suggested for a new Alice to Darwin railway line, Arkady's job is to identify the traditional landowners, to drive them over their old hunting grounds and to get them to reveal which rock or soak or ghost-gum is the work of a Dreamtime hero. Bruce is happy to join Arkady and to spend some time "out bush".The reader of this novel learns a lot about Australia and the Aboriginals. The plot and the characters however are a bit thin. One finds it hard to sympathise with the Aboriginal figures appearing in the story. What they have to say and the way they express themselves amounts to practically nothing. It seems as though they need the white people to tell their stories and traditions.

The book tells the sad tale of Lily Bart living in New York at the end of the 19th century. Her fate appears so real, merciless and inevitable because Edith Wharton's family history was acquired with the great names of the old New York society. The author manages to create a protagonist who at twenty-nine is already past the age of marriage which would be her only chance to secure a safe and comfortable future. But her character is complex and contradictory and the causes for her destruction lie within her own psyche. That is why she manages to cut herself at every turn by a combination of lack of judgement, lack of care and a great deal of arrogance towards the men who show interest in her. And so her decline, misstep after misstep, appears both gradual and inevitable.The author remarkably shows the social claustrophobia under which Lily Bart suffers. She evolves in an airless world of tight corsets, heavy draperies and closed rooms where she attempts to gasp for fresh air but fails and suffocates. She doesn't acknowledge that a woman of her class and situation can only support herself through an advantageous marriage. Edith Wharton clearly both disapproves of the wealth of the very rich and portrays them as inevitable. Because such people are invincible, Lily Bart is the agent of her own decline since she refuses to bargain with them in order to triumph. In this sense she is finally a victim because she cannot resolve the conflict between her ideals and her comfort or between what she aspires to be and what society insists she becomes.

Giambatista Bodoni, alias signorino Yambo, is a sixty-year old antiquarian book dealer. He suffers from retrograde amnesia and since there are two kinds of explicit memories, the semantic memory and the episodic memory, Yambo can remember things he read in books or was told - which are generated by the first type of memory - but not the things associated with his direct personal experience - which are stored in the second type of memory. He can't remember his wife Paola, his two daughters Carla and Nicoletta but he can recite countless quotations from the many books he has read.So Yambo gets slowly acquainted again with his surroundings, his relatives, his shop and his pretty assistant Sibilla. But he can't remember whether he fell in love with her although he hasn't forgotten all the tricks of the trade he needs for shopping at international auctions for rare books. He is shown family albums filled with faces which mean nothing to him so that his entire memory consists of the books he has read. Then Yambo decides to go to their country house in Solara to try to trace back his childhood with the help of his "paper memory" since it is there he can find all his early readings.Once settled in the attic of the Solara house, Yambo is surrounded by piles of books, magazines, cartoons, photographs and toys. He reflects on such topics as the articles in the "Nuovissimo Melzi", his favourite passages in books like "The Count Of Montecristo", "Huit jours dans un grenier" or the adventures of Buffalo Bill. He remembers the characters of his childhood, Captain Flint, Ciuffettino, Pipino, Sherlock Holmes, the Camicie Nere and the fascist propaganda. He listens to songs and anthems of the Mussolini epoch with the help of his grandfather's record collection.And one day he stumbles upon a "Tim Tyler's Luck" album featuring a story called "La misteriosa Flamma della Regina Loana" which brings back the memory of his first love for a girl called Lila Saba whose features have haunted him all his life.The story ends in a flurry or firework of literary protagonists, singers, film stars and cartoon characters descending a large staircase as though Yambo had lost control over his literary memories in a "radiant apocalypse".An imposing novel where Mr Eco shows what an erudite writer he is regarding matters of literature, politics, history and religion. The question of memory is important in this novel as Yambo realises that one cannot regard relics from one's childhood at the age of sixty in the same manner as one did when one was eight or thirteen.

These short stories were not really enjoyable to me. I found the humour bland, the characters shapeless, the plot in the stories ordinary (to put it mildly...) Short stories by Nadine Gordimer or Raymond Carver are in my view far superior. So it's really not the end of the world, there are many other books to read!

Vice-Questore Aurelio Zen, officer of the Criminalpol section of the Ministry of Interior in Rome, is entrusted with a video cassette connected to the sensational "Burolo Affair" about which Zen has to write a report summarising the case to date. Since Oscar Burolo had a mania of recording the highpoints of his life, the video tape shows a dinner party at his extravagant villa in Sardinia, when suddenly Oscar and his party reel away from shotgun blasts apparently coming from nowhere, the murderer having passed through the elaborate electronic defences of the property as if they didn't exist.But when, sometime later, a pickpocket manages to steal the video cassette while Zen is boarding a bus and when Zen is summoned to the Palazzo Sisti and asked by "l'onorevole" to go to Sardinia and fake some evidence in order to withdraw the charges against the main suspect Renato Favelloni, the inspector is about to start one of the most dangerous investigation in his career.Very good action-packed thriller with breathtaking scenes in Sardinia and an Aurelio Zen in full swing!Michael Tudor Barnes delivers a stunning performance reading "Vendetta".

For Matt Franklin and his comrades in arms, robbing a Securicor van should have been a routine operation but things didn't turn out the way they should have and the result was a disaster. Two of Franklin's companions are shot dead and a third one severely injured. Who is trying to wipe them and their families out? Could it be that the British army and government were implicated in the massacre? What lies behind the walls of a mysterious and secret research centre in the English countryside?Finally the only one left alive, Matt Franklin, with the help of DI Crane, becomes involved in a series of events that lead to the climax in the London underground.Such novels are to literature what instant soups are to gastronomy. They taste bad because the ingredients are miserable: guns, cars, blood, explosions, pursuits... But readers possessing the necessary degree of naivet&eacute; might be content with such a story line.

He is sent there to promote democracy through a mysterious Third Force. But his nave optimism about democracy starts to cause deaths and his friend the cynical British foreign correspondent Thomas Fowler finds it hard to stand aside and watch.

This novel is a result of his love for the country, inspired by his experiences there. Although the political situation has changed dramatically, The Quiet American continues to reflect accurately and powerfully the problems of war and the people involved in it.

The story is that of a group of men aboard the Nellie, among them the anonymous narrator, who are told Marlow's experience in the Congo in the 1890s. Marlow's career, like Conrad's, spans an important period in the history of relations between Europe and Africa. The author's purpose is to show that the "civilising" mission actually reveals the "darkness" at its own heart instead of bringing light into the darkness as it claims.In 1890 Conrad was appointed to the Congo by the Societe Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce and in June that year he reached Kinshasa, the Central Station in "Heart of Darkness". But soon the idealised realities of a boy's dreams were replaced by "the distasteful knowledge of the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience and geographical exploration" (in "Last Essays").Thus Marlow's journey to the Congo becomes a moral journey in which he confronts the workings of colonialism and his account is a frame-tale with inset stories, a so-called "oblique narration" - a tale within another tale. The darkness of Marlow's expedition is enhanced by the fact that his quest for Kurz contains repeated references to the latter's "eloquence" and "gift of expression" thus promising to articulate the solution to the moral and philosophical problems that the journey has created. Marlow's encounter with Kurz is a bitter disappointment with its "desolate exclamations, shrugs, hints ending in sighs".Although Conrad shows the criminality of inefficiency and selfishness of Europeans when dealing with the civilising work of Africa, the narrative is not gloomy. Kurz himself is merely a victim of the discourse of imperialism and his break-up shows how damaging it is for both Africans and Europeans.Another aspect in Conrad's novel is the stereotypical representation of women and the exclusion of the female reader. This is shown in Kurz's last words before dying: "The horror! The horror!" which refer to his Intended!

Reeves Minot, an old acquaintance of Tom Ripley's, is dabbling in the illegal gambling world of Hamburg and he wants Tom to get rid of one or two Mafia people who bother him. But because Tom has been enjoying a peaceful and secure existence in his house in Villeperce since the Derwatt affair, he is not prepared to do the job himself. Instead he suggests - more as a practical joke than anything serious because the man had been nasty to him once at a party - a person called Jonathan Trevanny to do the two killings. Jonathan is a thirty-five year old, mild mannered picture framer in Fontainebleau suffering from leukaemia and he agrees to do the job because of the comfort the 90 000 Dollars will bring to his wife Simone and small boy George. But killing Salvatore Bianca and Vito Marcangelo is going to have consequences that not even a Tom Ripley could have foreseen. "The Mafia never forgets" indeed!...A very entertaining Ripley mystery in Patricia Highsmith's famous style in which one can feel danger and menace lurking permanently in familiar surroundings.

A stranger arrives in Iping, where he books a private room in the pub. His behaviour intrigues the locals. He is foul-tempered and rude, and never removes the bandages covering his face. He remains confined to his room, working on mysterious experiments. We gradually discover that he is a scientist called Griffin who has made himself invisible, and is now desperately trying to regain visibility. He fails, goes on the rampage, and terrorises the surrounding countryside. He kills, and in the end is killed.Like in other stories by H.G. Wells, there is only one impossible hypothesis: that of invisibility which is then thrown into the ordinary world and the created fantasy becomes as real and vivid as a dream and inhabits the reader's mind. What matters to the author is probably the impact that a scientific invention would have on the world and the way in which people would react to it. In "The Invisible Man" he shows the unforgiving cruelty of the mob to the unusual, to the hunchback, the cross-eyed, the disfigured or the simpleton. The invisible man is just a powerful allegory for such people and that is why the novel has remained so powerful through time. It is also a clever study of character because Griffin strives to make himself unusual by becoming invisible and thereby placing himself above his fellow men and he becomes a man who sees in himself and in his uniqueness a power over others, a man possessed with the element that dictatorship is made of.Edward Hardwicke's fantastic reading of the novel for BBC Audiobooks is highly recommended.

These strikingly original short stories are set in a small village in Greece, &quot;so poor it doesn't have a name&quot;. They are extraordinary: shocking, colourful, amusing, resonant and sometimes tragic. Although Panos Karnezis writes in his second language, his style is fresh and lyrical and he has enriched and subverted English making it into a delight to read. He has created unforgettable characters and has cast a sharp eye on contemporary Greece. He is a master of the genre, like James Joyce, Raymond Carver or Guy de Maupassant.

Although the hero of James Joyce's novel is called Stephen Dedalus, the events and characters depicted in it parallel the author's own experiences. In his early childhood, at the very beginning of the 20th century, Stephen was sent to Clongowes, a Jesuit boarding school near Dublin. He disliked the place because his classmates bullied him, because he was taught religion in a dogmatic way and because he was flogged unjustly by his prefect of studies. After that he spent a summer with his uncle Charles in Dublin. Stephen was then sent to Belvedere college, which he disliked as much as Clongowes. The spirit of quarrelsome comradeship couldn't turn him away from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the agitation and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship, which he felt was an awful anticipation of adulthood.Stephen was by then aware that he didn't belong. He also felt more and more estranged from his father after having accompanied him once to Cork and witnessed his drinking habits, a journey which ended in Stephen's first experience in love making - a sordid one.More disappointment followed as Stephen went to university, thus becoming a disillusioned young man - a disillusionment caused by academicism, love and sex, his parents, religion and perhaps also his own country, Ireland...

The first case presented by Dr Yalom is a seventy-year-old lady called Thelma who fell in love with her previous therapist Matthew 8 years ago and has thus to deal with the difficult ethical question whether a therapist should be allowed to seduce a patient or be seduced by the patient.Carlos is virtually alone in the world and his obsession is to make love to as many women as possible, never twice to the same one.Betty is an extremely obese, plain, boring and deeply depressed twenty-seven year old woman. Because the therapist may sometimes be rebuked by a patient's physical appearance, this gives the opportunity to the author to talk about the concepts of transference and countertransference.Penny is a thirty-eight year old woman whose daughter died four years previously, whose husband abandoned her and whose son is in jail and the other hiding. She suffers from acute bereavement.Elva had been traumatised and suffers from post-traumatic stress, she feels unsafe, has a reduced startle threshold and is hypervigilant.Dave needs the therapist's help because he wants him to be the keeper of his love letters.Marie remains frozen in grief three years after the death of her husband and the only way to help her is an attempt to be treated by a hypnotherapist.Saul worked for a year at the Stockholm Research Institute and he is convinced that his research there was not really appreciated. When a first letter, then a second and a third arrive from the Institute, Saul is convinced that they are writing to him about the poor quality of his work and dares not open them. He then falls into a terrible depression.Marge's own evaluation is that she is nothing, garbage, a creep, a cipher. When her therapist leaves the city after treating her for ten years, she seriously considers suicide...And finally there is Marvin who at sixty-four starts developing disabling migraine headaches which result in impotence.In each case, Dr Yalom carefully describes his work as a psychotherapist in order to help his patients overcome their problems. One can only feel a strong empathy with each individual sufferer and marvel at the technique and stratagems the therapist has to use to cure those troubled personalities.

Il y a l'incompr&eacute;hension des parents qui s'inqui&egrave;tent de voir Vincent fr&eacute;quenter des gens "qui n'appartiennent pas au mme monde que nous" et qui s'inqui&egrave;tent de "pr&eacute;server l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; de notre classe" sans pour autant comprendre la vraie nature de la relation entre leur fils et Arthur.De plus, la guerre est omnipr&eacute;sente dans le roman mme si les protagonistes ne se trouvent pas directement sur le front des hostilit&eacute;s. C'est elle d'une part qui pr&eacute;cipite Arthur dans les bras de Vincent mais d'autre part elle repr&eacute;sente une menace permanente, une &eacute;p&eacute;e de Damocl&egrave;s qui finira in&eacute;vitablement par tomber, au plus tard &agrave; la fin de la permission d'Arthur. Pour Vincent, il s'agit l&agrave; d' "une semaine de tous les bouleversements", "d'un rendez-vous inattendu avec la vie facile et avec la mort possible". L'imminence certaine de perdre ces instants de bonheur, la prise de conscience du fait que tr&egrave;s bientt ces instants vont glisser du pr&eacute;sent vers le pass&eacute; donnent au le roman un parfum de m&eacute;lancolie et une tristesse irr&eacute;sistible. Vincent et Arthur savent bien que leur amour n'a aucune chance de survivre la guerre, elle qui est l&agrave; pour happer Arthur &agrave; la fin de la semaine. On sait bien que quiconque connat son avenir n'a plus d'avenir...

Ibrahim comes from an unnamed Arab country and Julie falls in love with him. Their relationship has to be kept secret all the more since Julie despises her privileged background. She is outright ashamed of her father - a businessman whose sole interest in life is money - and his new wife Danielle as well as of her mother who abandoned her daughter to marry a casino owner in California.When Ibrahim receives the order to depart from South Africa within 14 days because he is in contravention of the termination of his permit, Julie tries to resort to every legal way to prolong Ibrahim's sojourn, but to no avail. When Julie informs her father that she intends to accompany Ibrahim back to his homeland, he tells her bluntly: "You choose to go to hell in your own way." Before they depart, Julie and Ibrahim get married. Yet life in the small Arab village is far from hell. Although Ibrahim's sole concern is to obtain a visa for an English speaking country, Julie adapts quite nicely to her new surroundings, learns Arabic, teaches English and participates in the family life. When Ibrahim is granted a visa for America at last, he can't believe what decision his wife has taken...A beautiful, powerful novel about characters and their notions of the other being totally overturned. The social mix created by Mrs Gordimer between contemporary South Africa and the small Arab village in the desert is truly stunning. Let alone to see how much it takes for love to survive the circumstances of emigration and immigration, it is well worth reading "The Pickup".

The main Character in Mrs O'Dell's story is Harley Altmyer, an 18 year-old boy living in the small town of Laurel Falls. He has to look after his younger sisters, Jody, Misty and Amber, because their mother is serving a life sentence in prison since she killed their father. He works at a Shop Rite with two incompetent work mates, Bud and Church, under the command of the useless boss Rick. And he has a second part-time job at Barklay's Appliances. Their house is a permanent chaos and it is very difficult for Harley to make both ends meet. He is assigned a social worker and a psychoanalyst whom he both loathes. But he has no choice since he doesn't want his sisters to be officially declared orphans and be sent to foster families.The strength of this novel is the fact that the events are seen through Harley's young mind. He is often confused because he is not mature enough to have two jobs and educate his younger sisters at the same time. They in turn consider him more as a brother than a father and as a result there are frequent rows between them, especially between Harley and the elder girl Amber who strives for independence. But Harley is very much concerned by the well being of the girls and his worries even once make him have a hallucinatory vision of finding them dead at home, piled up in a pool of blood.At the same time he is looking for a girlfriend and wonders if it is possible to love someone without getting personally involved, without any mutual feeling or judgement. His first relationship is a confused one with a neighbour, Callie Mercer, wife of a bank manager and mother of two children. And Harley often recalls his father and how he used to ill treat his children.His struggle in life is all the more impressive since he gets no support at all from any adult, not even his uncle Mike.

The master of Petersburg is Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky. The events described in Mr Coetzee's novel are those which constitute the background and the action of Dostoevsky's &quot;The Devils&quot;.Fyodor Mikhailovich, travelling under the name of Isaev, returns secretly to St Petersburg in October 1869. Having arrived at 63 Svechnoi Street, he meets Anna Sergeyevna and her daughter Matryona in their apartment. This is the place where is son Pavel Alexandrovich used to reside before his recent death. In deep grief, Fyodor Mikhailovich covers his face with his hands and tears run over his fingers as he discovers his son's room. &quot;I am the one who is dead, he thinks; or rather, I died but my death failed to arrive.&quot; Such are the thoughts that burden Fyodor Mikhailovich's mind as the hunger to talk about his son and to hear others talk about him rises in him. There is no one present to strike his hair, no murmurs of consolation in his ear.Mr Coetzee places himself between known facts and Dostoevski's fiction, as Fyodor Mikhailovich seeks the truth about his son's death. Indeed, the circumstances of his death remain obscure because Pavel Alexandrovich was the member of a gang lead by Sergei Gennadevich Nechaev. This student anarchist movement became notorious for having murdered one of its own members...A tour de force, Mr Coetzee's novel reflects on the relation of writers to events. It's also a touching account of a father's deep grief and his painful adjustment to the past of his son. A powerful, subtly written, superb personal testament.

Miss Margaret Mackenzie is a lonely young woman when she receives an inheritance after the death of her brother Walter which amounts to 800 a year, quite a substantial allowance in the 1860s. Subsequently Margaret moves from London to Littlebath where she takes care of her niece Susanna. Being fair and wealthy, she becomes the object of desire of three gentlemen in particular: her cousin John Ball, Mr Maguire the clergyman and Mr Rubb, junior partner in the company of her brother Tom. Margaret's destiny changes abruptly when her lawyer tells her that actually Walter's money is not hers since it was given to her before Jonathan Ball's death and that it belongs to John Ball.Mr Trollope casts a critical glance at all the intricacies of the Victorian era: money, social position, marriage and business. Nevertheless, the novel is a suspenseful family saga and the plot is so cleverly constructed that it surpasses many a story written in the 21st century.

Mr Greene's novel is the story of Henry Pulling, a 50 year old retired bank manager who lives a quiet life in Southwood, passionately looking after his dahlias. Henry meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta for the first time at what he supposes to be his mother's funeral. She quickly persuades him to abandon his monotonous suburban life to join her and travel her way. And so they make their way first to Brighton and later to Paris, Istanbul and Paraguay. Through her aunt Henry gets acquainted with a twilight society, hippies, war criminals and CIA agents. He learns to smoke pot and to smuggle large amounts of money from one country to the next.The character of Aunt Augusta is very witty indeed: she is wicked, selfish, wildly engaging, an old "belle de nuit" who likes men "who have a bit of the hound in them", a quality her nephew obviously lacks, which adds to her bewilderment. It is a feminine character, Aunt Augusta, who takes charge of the story, a rare fact for Mr Greene. She becomes a fierce, bossy and intrusive mother figure for Henry. Indeed he ends up by understanding and calling her "mother" a few lines before the end of the novel as he lays his head on his aunt's breast, feeling like a boy again who has run away from school and will never have to return. Finally Henry is completely transformed by his aunt and, at 50, begins to blossom. He sees her differently and acknowledges that she is not as wicked as he first considered her. In a prison cell in Paraguay, Henry notes: "I would certainly have called her career shady myself nine months ago and yet now there seemed nothing so very wrong in her curriculum vitae, nothing as wrong as 30 years in a bank."

In this novel Mrs Brookner portrays the Dorn family. The head of the family, Mr Dorn, died sometime ago but there is Sofka the mother who is contemplating a photo album in which there are pictures of her children's weddings. She is a languid woman with few friends and deeply devoted to the members of her family. She constantly worries what will happen to the lives of her four children, how they will deal with the world and the world with them. There are two daughters, Mireille - Mimi - and Babette - Betty. The former is to marry Mr Lautner, the man who practically runs the family factory in London, quite late in life and the latter hurriedly marries Max Markus in Paris, the son of a film producer and they subsequently move to Beverly Hills. Sofka's elder son Frederick, a sympathetic but far from hard-working man finds his way into the hotel business on the Italian Riviera by marrying Evie. The younger son Alfred on the other hand is an austere man who is sternly devoted to the family business at the expense of his private life.The characters are well drawn although the plot does not offer much in terms of excitement or suspense. In this sense it is a true family and friends novel: people meeting, sons and daughters making their way into the world and a mother affectionately remembering her children's youth.

Major Henri Scobie is deputy-commissioner of police in a war-torn state in West Africa. A highly principled officer, he is forced to borrow money to send his despairing wife Louise on a holiday in South Africa. In her absence he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young widow, and his life is transformed by the experience. With a duty to repay his debts, an inability to distinguish between love, pity and responsibility to others and God, Scobie inexorably moves to his final damnation.The novel pictures a man who realises that despair is the price he has to pay for setting himself an impossible aim: to be just. He soon reaches the point of knowing about his absolute failure and of never being able to reach the heart of the matter. Because of his weakness Scobie is forced to tell so many lies that even for a Catholic like himself it is no longer possible to kneel down at the confessional. He knows that he is desecrating God because he loves another woman. There is no hope anywhere he turns his eyes: the dead figure upon the cross, the plaster Virgin or the religious representations of events which happened so long ago that they no longer seem relevant. Finally Scobie resigns himself to love failure because he can't love success. Even his promotion to commissioner means nothing to him anymore and he feels resigned to death because he isn't resigned to life anymore.

In his study, Mr Huxley discusses some of the ideas and observations which inspired him for his futuristic novel "Brave New World". Among the main topics, overpopulation of some parts of the world was a major concern for the author. The rapidly increasing number of people in relation to limited natural resources may lead to social instability and jeopardise the well being of individuals. There is a correlation between people multiplying too rapidly and the rise of totalitarian systems of government. Then the author discusses the issue of what should be undertaken with congenially or mentally insufficient organisms which are the result of unfavourable mutations. Should they be allowed to "contaminate" the genetic pool from which the members of our species will have to draw?Another problem of modern societies is the fact that the dehumanising effects of their over-organisation, especially in cities, may lead to a high incidence of schizophrenia. In "Brave New World" we see a society where people are never alone. This tendency can already be observed today as William Whyte rightly observes in "The Organisation Man". Concepts like "socially oriented behaviour, team work, group dynamics, acquisition of social skills" are very trendy nowadays.Other topics are discussed by Mr Huxley such as the concentration of communication-power in the hands of a few big concerns, the danger of people assembled in large crowds who then cease to have any judgement or will of their own - overwhelmed as they are by simplistic slogans - the question of children being conditioned by advertising from a very early age to buying specific products, the problems caused by widely available drugs such as "soma" and the effectiveness of subliminal projections and hypnopaedia.An altogether interesting read which allows a better understanding of Mr Huxley's "Brave New World".

This novel was published in 1945 and tells the harrowing tale of the Helianos family in Athens during the German occupation of Greece. Nikolas Helianos is a middle-aged part-owner and editor of a publishing house. He and his wife have a ten-year-old daughter Leda and a twelve-year-old son Alex. Their twenty-year-old son Cimon died in a battle at Mount Olympus in 1941. Mrs Helianos has reached the point of desperation of war when nothing else matters except the survival of her loved ones.Nikolas Helianos, a sedentary and philosophical man, does not participate in the underground or any sort of organised resistance to the occupiers of Greece. His relatives let him know that they consider him a coward and he is therefore particularly despondent when his family have to take a German officer, Ernst Robert Kalter, to live in their apartment. Nikolas sees that this is bound to bring disgrace as things stand between him and his kinsmen and he knows that it is the weak who are timid and conciliatory. Now in the actual physical presence of Kalter he is less than ever able to correct his character although he knows how deeply his wife hates the invaders of Greece since they took her first and best child's life.But little does Nikolas know how this forced confinement with the enemy is to turn out in fact and how the heroic Helianos' are later to speak of him, if not a true hero, at least a martyr.The serenity, moderateness and lack of sensation of the plot are worthy of a true Greek tragedy. The protagonists are conducting a psychological war against the enemy, building interior defences behind the mask of obedience and submission like walls to protect their lives.

Constance Chatterley, a beautiful and passionate woman, is deeply unhappy in her marriage to Sir Clifford Chatterley who became an invalid after having been injured in the First World War. His physical condition is mirrored in Constance's emotional paralysis. When she meets the gamekeeper Mellors, she finds refuge in his arms and feels regenerated. Together they shield themselves from the chaos of the outer world and move to the sanctum of the inner world of fulfilment.The character of Constance is an interesting one because there is a certain complexity in her: she is both in touch with nature, yet educated; sensitive, yet wise; female in her sensitivity, yet almost male in her strength and attitude. She is a woman with a social position who is drawn to an outsider of a lower class. The structure of the novel is also interesting because it shows three stages in Constance's relationship with her husband and Mellors. In the first phase, she denies her husband, responding to a failed marriage, she finds refuge with Mellors. Then begins the second stage when Constance regenerates in the peaceful world of her lover's hut. Finally in the third stage, she escapes the world of Wragby Hall as she leaves for a holiday to Venice. There she takes the resolution never to return to Clifford's world. This resolution is taken all the more easily by Constance because being away from Wragby Hall she can reconsider her commitment to Mellors while their relationship is gradually exposed as a scandal which really prevents her from returning to her husband. Then the novel's central struggle shifts from that between a Lady and a gamekeeper to that between Constance's and Mellor's commitment to each other and the forces hostile to their relationship.Constance's transformations occur in an set of tensions and an artistic dualism: tenderness against apathy, nature against culture, wood against stone, flesh against intellect, frankness against manipulation or fertility against sterility. These tensions strongly mark the first phase of the novel where Wragby Hall symbolises sterility and spiritual and emotional apathy, will and intellectual control; the hut symbolises the free play of the instinct and sensual pleasure, the haven of tenderness. The two worlds cannot interact: Clifford intrudes into nature with his mechanical wheelchair as much as Mellors is an intruder and outsider inside Wragby Hall. Perhaps the most striking opposition is that between silence and talk. As Constance and Mellors retreat into the sheltered world of the hut, the author insists on the stillness and the silence of the place, focuses on the internal and emotional feelings since both characters are fugitives from "the outer world of chaos." That's why enclosures are so present in the novel: the hut, the clearing, the cottage, an enclosed yard, a bedroom, as many shelters from psychological suffering. Mellors is "afraid of society" whereas Constance recoils from the "insanity of the whole civilised species." They both linger in pure silence, even anonymity since they hardly ever call each other by name.D.H. Lawrence's critics have deplored the numerous love making scenes in which Constance and Mellors induldge and which are described in a surprisingly open language, considering the epoch in which the novel was published. But these scenes show how Constance is "reborn", how sex is the act that most completely unites a man and a woman and its power of renewal is attuned to day, season or year - it is in this novel the most regenerative experience possible. There is indeed strong hope that John Thomas will be reunited with lady Jane in the future! In this sense, "Lady Chatterley's Lover" ranks among the 20th century most extraordinary achievements.

The novel tells the story of two friends in the spy trade, Ted Mundy who works for British Intelligence, and Sasha, a Stasi double agent who passes him information. The story follows Mundy's life from a childhood in Pakistan, public school in England, and his adult life in Germany. He first meets Sasha at the height of the Cold War, and their friendship continues through the fall of the Berlin Wall to the war in Iraq. They both get involved with a philanthropist who wants to create an alternative university to counter anti-war propaganda, but Mundy soon discovers it's not quite what it seems.John le Carr&eacute; shows that espionage is a conspiracy game, and those who play it are no more in command of their fate than any other person. The spy is a target for betrayal, even as he goes about his business of encouraging others in the practice. Mundy's dilemma is worse than a prisoner's, because for a spy there is exposure or worse if you are not lucky. This is the dark side of things which le Carr&eacute; explores well. Most members of SIS and the Security Services tend to be competent and decent people, as le Carr&eacute; has acknowledged at one time or another. But we get his meaning in "Absolute Friends": here is someone matched to the temper of our times: the hero as fall guy, as casualty of the workplace - the spy as victim.The novel is very well read by Michael Jayston for BBC Audiobooks.

Adriaan is an acclaimed Afrikaner poet living in Cape town, South Africa, at the time when the ethnic oppressions started to turn into violence. Adriaan is a secluded character who does not wish to discuss or read his poetry in public, who doesn't feel compelled to advertise his writing in literary journals. He isn't interested in so-called "admirers" of Afrikaans literature either and he is thus a fairly isolated figure in the small community of writers and artists of Cape Town. The fact that his companion Stephan left him a short while ago makes him feel even more lonely. Among his friends, Nico is a superficial and conceited actor relentlessly looking for an improbable lover in the latest cruising points in the city. The atmosphere of sadness and desolation is increased by the fact that Cape Town is becoming slowly depopulated and continuously invaded by the homeless and dispossessed who set up their camps among the empty, neglected and decayed buildings. The squatters' filthy shelters pop up everywhere in streets and in parks. Hawkers, peddlers, hucksters, thieves and beggars slowly creep into the city centre. As the oppression against the natives increases, bloody corpses litter the streets, blood is smeared over the pavement. "We learned not to ask questions; we learned to keep silent, we learned to accept." writes Mr. Schoeman. At the same time the members of the white community remain securely barricaded with their money and their comfort behind the high walls surrounding their properties. Gradually, acquaintances are leaving: Bernard's wife Marisa is leaving for Holland. She wishes "never even hear the name South Africa any more." The days of the small museum where Adriaan works are numbered, a decison taken by some official in Pretoria. Employees are gradually leaving it and looking for other job opportunities. Carla closes down her beach house in Brandvlei, knowing that she'll probably never return to it again. Even Dekker, an renown old poet, though physically still present in the country, took leave long ago and shut himself from the world with disillusionment.A very powerful novel depicting the darkest epoch of South Africa. The story of many characters drowning in sadness and abandonment because there is little hope for art, poetry or love in the future.

"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way". With this opening the reader is brought at the heart of the novel: family life and the lives led by the separate members of families. The idea of a novel about the grand monde had long haunted Tolstoy as well as writing about a married lady of that world who would ruin herself. The two lovers, Anna and Vronsky think that in their relationship they can escape society, but find they cannot. Without the freedom of the society they live in their passion becomes a kind of prison. Their entourage is too much part of them: they need it too much and the attempt to do without it destroys them both.All the characters in Anna Karenina are intensely real: the peasants in the fields, the people in Moscow, Stiva, Levin, Kitty, the Shcherbatskys. They all know each other, they live in the same world with the rest of the Russian upper class. The inner mental life and struggle of Levin reflects Tolstoy's own state of mind at the time he was writing. He had conservative views on marriage and childrearing which he thought were a woman's duty.Is the novel out of date? Would Anna today get a divorce, marry Vronsky and live happily ever after? Tolstoy didn't think so Tragedies like that of Anna Karenina do not depend on social change and enlightened social arrangements.

Martin Nanther's great-grandfather Henry Nanther was interested in blood. Henry Nanther became an expert in diseases related to blood, particularly haemophilia, of which some members of Queen Victoria's court suffered. Martin, wanting to write a biography of his great-grandfather, starts researching Henry's life and soon discovers that he was not just an expert in the matters of the blood but was virtually obsessed with it. Martin begins to suspect that his great-grandfather was less innocent about his work and life as he progresses through Henry's medical diaries and journals. It seems that he was trying to conceal something because the tragedies linked to haemophilia in his family do nor appear to be mere accidents. It may even be that they have implications for the blood doctor's descendant. It is Mrs Vine's fair achievement, though not her best book. Henry Nanther's story is lengthily interrupted by Martin Nanther's personal and marital preoccupations, so that the book would perhaps be more enjoyable if it were shorter.The reader of this audiobook is Mr Robert Powell. He appeared as Jesus in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; and he was Richard Hannay in &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;. His peroformance in &quot;The Blood Doctor&quot; is impressive and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to him.

Maurice Castle is working for the Secret Service. In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt.Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's &quot;The Human Factor&quot; in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel.

Indeed Engles is now a hard-bitten film director shooting in the Dolomites. To Blair, this seems like the chance of his lifetime and he thinks that his luck has turned at last. What he doesn't know is that the job also means getting caught in a breathtaking adventure with plenty of suspense and drama.An old fashioned adventure story much in the vein of what Hammond Innes usually wrote.

The novel opens with the harrowing scene of a woman called Kristina Tacker as she escapes from a psychiatric asylum. She vaguely remembers that her husband had the rank of Commander in the Swedish army and that he was a hydrographical survey engineer. At this moment, in 1937, Kristina Tacker is fifty-seven and it is twelve years since she has uttered her last word.The reader is immediately drawn into the suspense created by this opening as he follows the story of the main character, Lars Tobiasson-Svartman, a man obsessed by the depths of the sea and torn between two women, Sara Frederika and his wife Kristina Tacker. We follow his destiny at the beginning of World War I as he slowly loses his grip on his surroundings and becomes entangled in a web of lies and crimes which inexorably leads to his downfall. He ends up by living in a world entirely created by lies. Indeed he becomes an impostor; an impostor lives a life but the deceit involved lives a different life. It is the tragic fate of a man whose life has always been based on lunatic ideas and who has built his existence on distances and depths instead of seeking closeness.

Dr Edward Haggard is a country doctor in England just before the beginning of World War II. He has a practice on the south coast and one day James Vaughan pays him a visit. He is the sun of the most fascinating woman Dr Haggard ever knew. And so the memories of a passionate love affair are resurrected and the reader slowly discovers why Dr Haggard is practicing general medicine in a small forgotten sea resort, now a shattered and broken man in body and spirit.The novel catches the feel of England in the 1930s; the barely suppressed terror in the face of approaching war. It is also the story of a relationship which goes wrong, a beautiful story impressively told with a restraint which gives the description of the love affair an epic quality. A splendid novel in the same vein as Graham Greene's The End of the Affair.

This is a very good thriller and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The plot is fast-moving and well constructed. I felt a lot of sympathy for the main character, Danny Cray, because he is not the typical hero, in fact he is what you might call an anti-hero. He often lacks self-confidence, he is a hesitating if clumsy man and so the identification reader-hero is all the more easy. I would compare Danny Cray to Cary Grant in Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;North By Northwest&quot;.

Doris Lessing's "The Grass is Singing" opens with the death of Mary Turner. How could Mary's life have ended with such a tragic fate? As the reader progresses through the novel, he discovers Mary's insufferable existence, her life destroyed by a disastrous marriage to a farmer, Dick Turner. Mary is forced to live in a rural environment in South Africa for which she is ill-suited. Furthermore, Mary's relationship with her husband rapidly deteriorates as she realises that Dick is unable to manage the farm successfully and they are constantly on the verge of bankruptcy. A truly superb novel, tragic and moving to the very last line. Mrs Lessing's wonderfully captures Africa's majestic beauty, the difficult relationship between the whites and the Natives. The psychological portrait of her heroine is exceptionally intense.

Mr Leavitt's ridiculously shallow and hollow novel tries to portrait an eighteen year old man, Paul Porterfield, who aspires to become a great pianist because he worships Richard Kennington, a forty year old piano prodigy. But lacking in talent, Paul's destiny is to remain a page turner.What is Mr Leavitt writing about? He only hints at the psychological aspect of Paul's broken ambition which, according to the title, is supposed to be the topic of this novel. If he wants to depict the attraction of an ageing man for a young boy of eighteen, Mr Leavitt should read Thomas Mann or Stefan Zweig, both authors being much more successful on this topic. The reader will be deeply disappointed by many fastidious passages - Paul walking "without underwear", a fruit seller with a basket from which "scarlet peppers spilled out in obscene abundance" - and by the numerous and tiring clich&eacute;s like "in Rome there is always a nearby bar". Oh dear, oh dear... As the title of this review suggests, simply leave it.

Anita Desai's short stories reflect the kaleidoscope of modern Indian life. They are set in contemporary Bombay and other cities and they evoke the colours, sounds, smells and white-hot heat of Indian cities. The stories are peopled with intensely individual characters: there is a painter living in a slum who fills his paintings with landscapes, birds and flowers he has never seen. There is an American woman who turns to the hippies in the Indian hills because she is unhappy with her life in the verdant countryside of Vermont. There is a man spiritually transformed by the surface texture of a melon. And many more. It is a finely written, atmospheric, memorable collection of short stories. As always with Anita Desai, her work is warm, perceptive, both funny and touched with sadness.

Mr Cross's novel inflicts on the reader a dreary litany of scenes in which people dress, eat, watch TV, smoke, drink wine or beer and utter the blandest of banalities of which the following quotation is quite representative: "People are freaked out by a train crash, which is a rare occurrence and unlikely to happen again any time soon. More people die every day on British roads than die annually on the railways. But rail crashes are newsworthy. After a crash, nervous passengers take to the roads. The roads are a great deal more dangerous than railways. And the more congested the roads are, the more dangerous they are. Simple really."One example of the many enlightening passages in this novel...

In a provincial town 800 km north of Buenos Aires a group of revolutionaries kidnap by mistake Charly Fortnum, the Honorary Consul, instead of the American Ambassador. They request the liberation of 10 prisoners from Paraguay.The characters are brilliantly drawn and the prose is sparse and taught. Fortnum, sixty-one year old, living on whisky and his disputed status as an "Honorary" British Consul marries a young ex-prostitute from Senora Sanchez's brothel. Dr Eduardo Plarr whose deficient emotions form the heart of the novel. Although Plarr is Clara's lover and the father of the child she's expecting, he still envies Fortnum's love for her because it is a feeling he has never been capable of experiencing himself. Even the minor characters of the kidnappers, Aquino, Father Rivas and Marta are sardonically drawn and during the bungled kidnap, plenty is said among them about justice, faith, love and God during the 3-day confine in a dirty mud and tin hut.

In this novel, Graham Greene tells the story of seven main characters who all embark on a train journey from Ostend to Istanboul. Coral Musker, a good natured variety dancer with a bad heart, Dr Richard John, Myatt Carleston, a Jewish tradesman dealing in currants, Mr Opie, a clergyman, Janet Pardoe and Mabel Warren, a couple of lesbian women, Dr Richard Czinner, a famous socialist agitator who disappeared from Belgrade five years before and is now returning to his country to stand trial and finally Joseph Gr&uuml;nlich, a notorious Viennese thief and murderer.As the story unfolds, more and more is revealed to the reader about the characters' past, some having had a rather shady existence. Mr Greene skilfully shows how different personalities react and behave in a sort of mental struggle once they are thrown together and forced to spend three days in the confined space of a railway carriage. A short, tense and disturbing novel which shows that one rarely escapes one's fate. The reader, Michael Maloney, performs a commendable act, using an wide variety of accents. An excellent audiobook.

Rowland Mahler and his wife Nina founded the College Sunrise in Ouchy, Switzerland. They are respectively 29 and 26 and they have nine students. Rowland teaches creative writing and in his spare time he aspires to become a novelist. But then his seventeen year old student Chris Wiley starts writing a novel about Mary Queen of Scots entitled "Who Killed Darnley" and Rowland suffers from writing block because he is jealous of the ease with which Chris's writing progresses. Rowland can't understand why his teenage pupil is able to write like a professional, how he can manage language so wonderfully and with so little experience. Nothing compared with his own dismal efforts at mediocre prose.But as the reader progresses along the plot, he realises that nothing in Mrs Spark's novel is as it seems. The characters are well drawn, the scenes are often very amusing because they are laced with acute and witty observations about authors, publishers, school life, marital relationships and more generally about present day preoccupations.

One day in Villeperce, Tom Ripley is followed by an American teen-aged boy of 16 who calls himself Billy Rollins. He is currently working as a gardener with Madame Jeanne Boutin and claims to have read about Tom Ripley in the newspapers in the States. But Tom soon discovers that the boy is in fact Frank Pierson, the son of an American food magnate from Maine, who detested his father so profoundly that he killed him by pushing his wheelchair over the top of a cliff. Frank's mother Lily sent a private detective to France to look for the missing son...A weak story line, unbelievable situations, characters who behave in a ridiculous fashion and plenty of clich&eacute;s about Germany, Berlin and the gay scene are all aspects which contribute to the bad quality of this poorly designed suspense story. Neither "The Boy Who Followed Ripley" nor "Ripley Underground" nor "Ripley Underwater" match the original "The Talented Mr Ripley". Readers would be well advised to enjoy the latter and then forget any novel bearing the name "Ripley".

Anne Frank kept a diary from 12 June 1942 to 1 August 1944 when Holland was under the Nazi regime. She accounts of the suffering of her family who spent this period of time hidden in the Secret Annexe, just before being arrested on 4 August 1944. Although the &quot;Diary&quot; is now fifty years old, it remains in my view an astonishing and excruciating account of what Jews had to endure during the Second World War. The evidence of Anne Frank's ferocious appetite for life gnaws at us still.

Amin Jaafari is a hard-working and talented surgeon at a busy Tel Aviv hospital, two generations away from his Arab origins. He is wealthy, popular with his Jewish colleagues, and devoted to his wife Sihem. The novel opens with Amin taking charge of the chaos in the emergency room after a suicide bomber attacks a restaurant in the Hakirya district of Tel Aviv, killing 19 people including a group of schoolchildren at a birthday party. Subsequently Amin is stopped and searched four times by Israeli policemen on the way home. He only wakes up to his own misfortune when he learns that Sihem has been killed in the bombing and that her wounds correspond to those found on suicide bombers.Amin refuses to believe that Sihem could have committed such an act of terror. He expects her to return soon from Kfar Kanna where she is visiting her old grandmother. Disbelief gives way to horror when Sihem's last letter, posted from Bethlehem, turns up in his post box. As a consequence of Sihem's attack Amin's life, ambition, values and friendships disintegrate. He locks himself up in a nightmare of drink and despair in which he reflects on every aspect of his life, nationality and marriage. A Jewish colleague, Kim Yehuda, calls Amin back from the brink. He retraces Sihem's last journey from Tel Aviv to Bethlehem and back again. There Amin is repeatedly beaten up: by the Shin Bet, his Tel Aviv neighbours and Palestinian militants in the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Jenin that were under siege by the Israeli army. Nevertheless he clings to his belief that as a surgeon his fight consists in recreating life in the place where death has chosen to conduct its manoeuvres.The Attack uses both suicide bombing and the fate of many Israeli citizens who are of Arab origin. These are the descendants of the Arabs who stayed in the country rather than go into exile at the formation of Israel in 1948. Like Amin Jaafari in the story, they have suffered discrimination and mistreatment but have also prospered, and are now squeezed between an tormented Jewish state and their rebel fellow Arabs in Gaza and on the West Bank.

The Beggar is the story of lawyer Omar al-Hamzawi who belongs to the generation that could have provided Egypt with leadership but have instead been deprived of any significant function. Omar fails to care enough at the right time because he belongs to a liberal secularism which is simply an operative ideal or yearning. The novel is a plea against irrelevance and alienation. It is also about things which matter and matter in places outside the Arab world.The Thief and the Dogs is a psychological novel of the impressionist kind - it uses the stream-of-consciousness technique like novels by James Joyce or Virginia Woolf - which moves with the speed and economy of a detective story. The technique allows the author to show the mental anguish of the central character, Said Mahran, who is consumed by bitterness and a desire for revenge against the individuals and the society who have corrupted and destroyed him and brought his damnation. It gives the reader a keen observation of the workings of a sick and embittered mind doomed to self-destruction. As he comes to Said's disillusionment and despair, the reader gains interesting impressions of the values and structures of Egyptian society in the 1960s.Autumn Quail opens with the famous Cairo fire which followed the massacre of Egyptian policemen at the Suez Canal by British soldiers in 1952. It goes on to trace the main events of the early stages of the revolution, the purge of corrupt officials and the abolition of political parties and comes to an end after the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company in 1956. The central character whose fall is portrayed is Isa ad-Dabbagh, a senior civil servant in the Egyptian government during the final days of the monarchy. Isa's willingness to accept bribes catches up with him and he is pensioned off. But Isa remains stubbornly loyal to the old regime and his concern for his country makes him a true patriot. But his relationship with the Alexandrian prostitute Riri represents Isa's real fight with emotion, his failure to meet his moral responsibilities and his eventual realisation through a very bitter lesson of what those responsibilities are. The novel provides the reader with insights and reflections on the Egyptian revolution and its progress with characters from different backgrounds and with varying social and political attitudes.

In this novel, the first published by Solzhenitsyn in 1962, the author chose to portray one ordinary day of Ivan Denisovich Shukov at a camp from reveille to retreat based on what he himself experienced in the year 1937. The work impresses so much because it is a portrayal with extraordinary vitality and thoughtfulness of its characters. One feels that only the author's personal experiences can lend the story its sense of authenticity. As a result of the violation of Soviet legality, people were put to camps and had to undergo severe physical and moral tests under extreme circumstances. That's why Shukhov's "ordinary" day arouses in the reader the feeling of pain for the fate of the people who rise up before us so vivid and so near. Yet the author's unique skill lies in the fact that the bitterness and pain are not rendered by a feeling of hopeless depression but by the profound humanity and solidarity of the inmates. The author shows that even in such a grim place as a Soviet camp there is room for humour, hope and feelings. Finally Solzhenitsyn being a first class stylist, his novel is written in the colourful and lively language in which folk metaphors are mixed with camp jargon.

In this epic novel, Mr McCann combines both historical facts and fiction. On the historical side, the story opens with the digging of a railway tunnel under the East River in New York in 1916. The reader follows the main character, a coloured man called Nathan Walker, a sandhog who struggles daily with his shovel against the earth. The working conditions are atrocious: the heat, the noise, the dirt, the physical strain - the digging was done by manpower in these days. Later Nathan marries Eleanor O'Lear, a white woman of Irish descent. Such a marriage was considered by most New Yorkers as a disgrace at that time. They bring up two children, both a social and a financial challenge.Parallel to Nathan Walker's story, the reader follows another character, a homeless man nicknamed Treefrog who made his home in one of the many disused tunnels in New York in the 1990s. At first there appears to be no connection between Nathan and Treefrog but soon enough the reader discovers how and why they are linked in the novel.With a marvellous narrative for its economy, Mr McCann constructs a beautiful epic story of laughter and tragedy, of sadness and small victories. It is an authentic account about homelessness, about living below the rich and about the stronghold of the past.

Dr Frederick Starks is a widowed psychoanalyst in New York. He is a man devoted to regularity, almost touching on obsession, because he thinks that by imposing reason on his day-to-day life he can make sense more easily with the chaos that his patients bring to him daily. He is therefore all the more distraught when, on his 53rd birthday, he receives a mysterious envelope containing a frightening text. The opening sentence of the letter welcomes him to the first day of his death... The author of the letter, a certain Rumplestiltskin, claims that Dr Starks ruined his life and now wishes that he kills himself within a time frame of exactly fifteen days. If Dr Starks refuses to commit suicide, his relatives will suffer torments which they will never recover from.Who could that Rumplestiltskin be and what made him hate Dr Starks so furiously? A former patient? A madman? Dr Starks will soon realise how seriously he had better take these menaces if he wants to survive the imposed fifteen-day deadline, the most dreadful fifteen days one can imagine.Breathtaking suspense, intelligent characters and an utterly believable plot are the ingredients which make Mr Katzenbach's novel a real pleasure to devour.

Mr Powers begins his novel by following a narrator travelling by train from Chicago to Boston. He has to change trains in Detroit and since he has several hours at his leisure, he decides to visit the Detroit Institute of Arts. There, he is puzzled by a photograph taken by Augustus Sander in 1914 showing three farmers on their way to a dance. The reader follows the narrator's progress as he tries to find answers to the questions that preoccupy him about the photograph: who took it, why was it taken, who are the three farmers appearing in the picture.On another level, Mr Powers gives a fictional account - or it may also be the result of the narrator's research, it is not explicit in the text - of the action taking place at the time the photograph was taken and also what happens subsequently. And so the reader gets to know the three farmers Hubert, Peter and Adolphe.Yet on another level, the author introduces various contemporary characters working in the Powell Building for a magazine called "Micro Monthly News": Mays, Moseley, Delaney. After having at first the impression that the events at this level are unrelated to the two other levels, the reader soon realises that there is a connection indeed.What makes Mr Powers's novel interesting are his many reflections on various topics. These range from the situation of a small Belgian village called Petit Roi during the First World War, the part that Henry Ford played in that war, various personalities like Darwin, Freud, G&ouml;del, Planck or Sarah Bernhardt, to the Industrial Revolution and the changes that mechanisation brought to our civilisation. And because the main protagonist so to speak of the novel is a photograph, Mr Powers also deals in detail in the history of photography.A very instructive novel, plenty of interesting points of view that show Mr Powers's broad knowledge.

In this witty and delightful novel the author portrays a character called Kaspar Joachim Utz, an unconventional collector of Meissen porcelain. Despite all efforts to suppress individualism the communist regime of the late 1960s Czechoslovakia allowed Utz to keep a spectacular private collection of porcelain amounting to more than a thousand pieces, all crammed in a small two-roomed flat in Prague. The account of how Utz built up his collection is truly moving and the humour with which Mr Chatwin describes his peregrinations across Europe is irresistible. Wars, pogroms and revolutions offer excellent opportunities for the collector, Utz remarks ironically!The novel is a sharp account of the history of Middle Europe from the 1850s to the Prague Spring in 1969, of the history of the Meissen porcelain production, of the absurdities of communism and also of the Czech spirit of which Mr Chatwin is a very keen observer.

Ben Du Toit teaches history and geography in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is the period of the height of the youth riots in the township of Soweto. At Ben's school, Gordon Ngubene, a native, is a cleaner and he occasionally does little chores for Ben. When Ben sees that Jonathan, Gordon's son, is showing signs of intelligence and diligence, he decides to partly finance his education. One day however, Jonathan takes part in a demonstration which ends up in a violent riot and is arrested by the police. A few weeks later, after a harrowing quest through countless offices, Ben and Gordon are informed that Jonathan died "of natural causes" while in detention.Due to the mystery surrounding his son's death, Gordon gives up his job in order to devote himself entirely to the enquiries which have become an obsession with him. Both the Special Branch and the Security Police are annoyed about Gordon's insistence and soon enough Gordon is arrested. After numerous attempts to try to trace Gordon and speak to him, Ben and Gordon's wife Emily are told by the spokesman of the Security Police that Gordon apparently committed suicide by hanging himself with strips torn from his blanket.But Ben Du Toit senses that the official explanations for both Jonathan's and Gordon's deaths are just a pretext for poorly disguised murders and so he decides to take matters in his own hands and starts investigating.Mr Brink's novel is a harrowing account of a solitary man's fight against all the atrocities of the Apartheid. During this dark period in the history of South Africa, a white man had to be a real hero to fight for the right of the Afrikaners. The author beautifully captures the fact that Ben has to fight not only the resentment of the people of the other race, but also that of the people belonging to his own race - his family for a start. The descriptions of the townships of Johannesburg, particularly that of Soweto, are breathtaking in their accuracy and poignancy.

Mrs Morrison has produced a complex, wonderful and imaginative story of epic dimension about the Dead family and thus more generally about the African American experience in the USA. On the one hand, the reader follows the story of Macon Dead and his son who has the same name and who marries Ruth Foster, daughter of Dr Foster, and their children Lena, First Corinthians and Macon "Milkman" and on the other hand the story of Macon Dead's sister Pilate Dead, her daughter Reba and her grand-daughter Hagar.Thus the plot spans over nearly a century and one is dazzled by the family's spellbinding search for their past and their roots which ends dramatically on the top of Solomon's Leap.Mrs Morrison put a lot of truth, wisdom and humour in her narrative and "Song of Solomon" is bound to become a classic American tale of the 20th century.

The plot in "The Leopard" spans some 50 years, from 1869 to 1910. The novel opens when the Bourbon sates of Naples and Sicily, called the kingdom of the Tow Sicilies, is about to end and the Italian peninsula is to become one state again for the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire. The first chapter is set in May 1860 precisely when Garibaldi arrives in Sicily from Genoa. The "Garibaldini" land in Marsala and within two weeks occupy the capital, Palermo. Gathering more volunteers, Garibaldi crosses to the mainland and defeats the Bourbon troops on the Volturno. Subsequently Garibaldi hands over southern Italy to King Victor Emmanuel and every state in the peninsula agrees to join the new united kingdom via plebiscites. Finally the revolutionary actions of the Risorgimento - the movement for unification - are ended by the Italian government troops and Rome is declared as capital of Italy in 1870.It is against this historical background that the reader follows the life of Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, a Sicilian aristocrat who watches impassively the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance. He is no less abated by the decline of his own prestige than the numerous prancing bewhiskered stone leopards adorning his palaces. One follows his worries about daughters, dowries, political careers and religious intrigues. He submits to endless little subterfuges, he the leopard who used to sweep away effortlessly difficulties with the wave of his paw. Don Fabrizio is surrounded by a multitude of hilariously grotesque characters with whom the author casts an amused but bitter glance at the Sicilian mentality. "The Sicilians never want to improve for the simple reason that they think themselves perfect; their vanity is stronger than their misery; every invasion by outsiders, whether so by origin, if Sicilian, by independence of spirit, upsets their illusion of achieved perfection, risks disturbing their satisfied waiting for nothing; having been trampled on by a dozen different peoples, they consider they have an imperial past which gives them a right to a grand funeral."Giuseppe di Lampedusa painstakingly meditated for twenty-five years over his novel. He was sixty before he finally wrote it and he completed it a few months before his death in 1957. He was then told by an Italian editor that his novel is unpublishable!

Three men meet on the Medea, a ship sailing from Philadelphia to Haiti, a country then in the grip of the corrupt Doctor Duvalier - Papa Doc - and his sinister secret police, the Tontons Macoute.Brown is a sixty-year old owner of the hotel Trianon in Port-au-Prince which he inherited from his mother. The place used to swarm with guests, there used to be cocktails and music but now with the Duvalier regime, hardly any tourists come to Haiti. He is a man without roots and often disillusioned because he has lost the capacity to be concerned, Yet subsequent events in the novel show that he is a man who can get involved if the situation requires him to do so, even at the expense of his own safety. In this sense he is a true humanist.Mr and Mrs Smith are an American couple travelling to Haiti to open a centre of vegetarian cooking in Port-au-Prince. The reality they are about to discover is bound to disappoint them bitterly. These two characters show that a passionate belief in the integrity of the world may not be a simple flaw in character.And then there is Mr Jones the confidence man whom everyone likes because he can make people laugh despite the fact that little of what he claims can be taken seriously.These are the comedians in Mr Greene's novel. As the narrator states at one point: as long as we pretend, we escape. The atrocious dictatorship of Papa Doc is vividly portrayed and looking back it seems hardly believable that such an appalling personage was once viewed as a safeguard against communism in Haiti by Washington. The darkness and the terror of the curfew, the telephones that don't work, the Tontons Macoute in their dark glasses, the violence, injustice, torture and poverty, everything is sharply described by the author. And yet despite all the pain there is always time for love and laughter.This book has been published as an audiobook by the BBC and is read in a superb way by the comedian Tim Pigott-Smith.

This is the story of Elizabeth Erdman, a professional singer, from the time she was a young woman in the 1920s to her death on 29 September 1941 in Kiev where she was killed like many other Jews by the Nazis. The tale is a subtle maze of poetry and case history, dreams, fantasy and historical facts. The novel opens with a letter written by Sigmund Freud about one of his patients, a young woman singer whose career was interrupted and who wrote "verses" between the staves of a score of "Don Giovanni" showing that she suffers from a severe sexual hysteria.Indeed, in the first chapter, the reader is confronted with Lisa's "verse", a mixture of pornographic material and hallucinatory dreams of horrible events that took place at a white hotel set in the Austrian Alps. Then follows an account in prose of how the patient allegedly met Freud's son who took her to the white hotel where she experienced a nearly constant sado-masochistic love making. There she also "witnessed" several tragedies: the hotel catching fire, people perishing in a landslide or in a cable-car accident.Following this account, a fictional Freudian case study partly explains Lisa's hallucinations through a careful analysis of her youth. After Freud's psychotherapy, Lisa appears to have regained her sanity because as of the spring of 1929, she resumes her career as a singer and becomes quite a renown artist. The reader follows her from Milan to Vienna where she marries Victor. Her voice gradually fades in quality and her final move is to Odessa before World War II and before the Nazis manage to occupy this Russian city.A book to experience rather than simply to read, a haunting and strange novel, its plot woven like a tapestry, full of beautiful and sad characters.

Mr Gold adroitly and expertly advocates the necessity of reading in our lives. Actually he goes as far as claiming that reading is a biological necessity in the same way as eating is. Reading is thinking, imagining, understanding, feeling and healing. It is an activity that is far from an escape or an avoidance of reality because it provides the reader the necessary relief from the ad hoc reacting and chaos of socialising by taking care of us, leading us and letting us imagine alternative lives through the complex paths of experience and language.In this sense reading truly is a therapeutic experience and Mr Gold gives numerous examples of patients he managed to cure by giving them novels to read because they are an experiential tool for re-seeing and reordering the reader's own confusing experience. Novels take on our confusion, they bear our burdens and leave us to see the larger picture we cannot see because they offer another perspective.Reading being the most powerful and plentiful source of information, it isn't surprising that a vital element for the survival of any totalitarian regime is to take control of what people read because language is power. Authors like Aldus Huxley, George Orwell and above all Ray Bradbury have masterfully illustrated this point in their novels, the latter showing what happens to a civilisation in which television replaces literacy. People may still be able to read but they are what we may call "literary illiterates".No doubt Mr Gold's message is clear: we have to read for the salvation of our spirit.

Andreas's disappearance is a mystery to all, especially to his inseparable friend Zipp. But as much as inspector Sejer and his colleagues question him, it isn't easy for Zipp to come forward with details of the last time he saw his friend. They had been following an old woman, Irma Funder, an easy target for some quick cash, and Andreas, brandishing a knife, boldly followed her into her house. The next moment he was gone. Zipp had anxiously waited for his friend but Andreas was never to reappear...A good thriller in which the author tackles the reasons people commit crimes with devastating effect.The novel is read by David Rintoul for BBC Audiobooks. A commendable performance.

In a surreal turn-of-the-century London, Gabriel Syme, a poet, is recruited to a secret anti-anarchist taskforce at Scotland Yard. Lucian Gregory, an anarchist poet, is the only poet in Saffron Park, until he loses his temper in an argument over the purpose of poetry with Gabriel Syme, who takes the opposite view. After some time, the frustrated Gregory finds Syme and leads him to a local anarchist meeting-place to prove that he is a true anarchist. Instead of the anarchist Gregory getting elected, the officer Syme uses his wits and is elected as the local representative to the worldwide Central Council of Anarchists. The Council consists of seven men, each using the name of a day of the week as a code name; Syme is given the name of Thursday. The Secretary is Monday, Radcliffe is Wednesday, Gogol is Tuesday, Professor Worms is Friday, Dr Bull is Saturday and the President is Sunday. In his efforts to thwart the council's intentions, however, Syme discovers that five of the other six members are also undercover detectives; each was just as mysteriously employed and assigned to defeat the Council of Days. They all soon find out that they are fighting each other and not real anarchists; such was the mastermind plan of the genius Sunday. In a dizzying and surreal conclusion, the six champions of order and former anarchist ring-leaders chase down the disturbing and whimsical Sunday, the man who calls himself "The Peace of God".The book was intended to describe the world of wild doubt and despair which the pessimists were generally describing at the beginning of the 20th century; with just a gleam of hope in some double meaning of the doubt, which even the pessimists felt in some fitful fashion.

Samar is a 20 year old student in 1989. He arrives in Benares, "the Oxford of the East", where he hopes to study and spend his time with his favourite books. He is a shy young man who does not enjoy the casual display of personality at social gatherings. The superficial amiability and the light chatter make him feel uncomfortable and he doesn't enjoy taking part in conversations, afraid to say the wrong thing and not quite sure what the right thing to say is. He grew up alone and therefore developed no skills for intimacy or even friendship which he feels requires a degree of self-abnegation from him.However after meeting several characters like Miss West, Rajesh - a fellow student who turns out to be a criminal - and Catherine, Samar slowly realises that socialising allows him to discover a whole new world. It is particularly his love affair with Catherine which he experiences as a strong emotional turmoil. It is understandable since Samar grew up in a culture where men and women are ushered into marriage after parents have convinced each other about their respective social and financial status. Love is supposed to follow marriage and not the other way round and it doesn't matter much if it doesn't...An interesting tale of a young provincial man who struggles to make sense of a strange and alien cosmopolitan world. The descriptions of Pondicherry, Allahabad, Benares, Dharamshala and the Himalayas are lyrical and the reader is constantly reminded of the bewitching power of India.

In this novel, Mr Greene portrays various characters in an unnamed southern province of Mexico at the time when the Red Shirts - a Communist party - have taken control. It is well known however that these events took place under Presiedent Calles, elected in 1924, and the infamous atheist Governor of Tabasco, Garrido Canabal.The central figure of the novel is a nameless priest, a so-called "whisky priest" since this spirit was used during illegal Masses due to the lack of wine. Furthermore, the name attests for a drinking habit with most illegal priests in this tropical, crooked and anti-clerical part of Mexico. The story-line is a succession of harrowing scenes as the haunted priest tries to keep conducting his Masses but the most ironical and corrosive scene is the one in which he must watch a half-caste mestizo, a fiercely anti-clerical lieutenant and a corrupt chief of police drink up a bottle of wine he had bought with his last money for sacramental use.Graham Greene's sympathy with the poor in spirit and the world's losers is obvious. The whisky priest's descent into illegality and darkness and his simultaneous ascent in martyrdom are spectacular because they so dominate the plot - all other characters have an insignificant importance except that of the lieutenant. The priest's existence seems particularly dogged and doomed not only because of the illegality of his clerical activities but also because he is an alcoholic and has an illegitimate daughter. But clearly the author distinguishes between man and function and this also applies to Father Jos&eacute;, a debased priest compelled by the authorities and his own cowardice to marry - a figure of ridicule even to the children of the town.Finally it is worth mentioning the author's brilliantly built and abrupt scenes and artfully lit images which have a cinematic touch of surreal reminiscent of pictures by Luis Bunuel.

This novel was called &quot;A True Story&quot; by Mr Roth. Indeed, many parts in &quot;Patrimony&quot; have a personal tone. The author talks about his mother's sudden death in a restaurant in 1981 and about the sad and painful last year of his father's life. Herman Roth was diagnosed with a massive brain tumou so that little by little he became more and more disabled and needed constant attention. It is impressive to see the author's devotion and attention to his ageing father, all the more since his condition required an almost constant care. One also feels the father's shame and embarrassment as his physical condition worsens.Mr Roth manages to create an irrepressible and irresistible hero, his father.

Mr Carey's novel relates the epic life of Ned Kelly in Australia in the second half of the 19th century. The text comes in the form of 13 parcels of varying length (from 7 to 50 pages). Sometimes they are sheets of National Bank or Bank of New South Wales letterhead, a cloth booklet, octavo pages, open envelopes providing space for text, a pocket diary or the reverse side of advertising fliers. They cover Ned's adventurous life until the manuscript abruptly terminates when he was 26 years old and it is told in a tone so wild and passionate that the reader often believes that the bushranger is speaking to him from the grave! It is a breathtaking account of an existence marked by a cascade of events where Ned is in turn a reformer, a criminal, a horse thief, a farmer, a bushranger and an orphan. Ned's voice is very convincing, continually creating new surprises on every page despite the plainness of his language, or rather perhaps because of it. Actually his uneducated voice is very much part of the originality of Mr Carey's novel.The critics have ranked Mr Carey next to Charles Dickens and Lawrence Sterne - very rightly so, in my opinion.

Mr Brink's novel is set during the last days preceding the violence which broke out in South Africa and brought the apartheid regime to an end. The time span in "Rumours of Rain" is exactly three days, starting from Friday and extending to Monday, an "apocalyptic" week end for Martin Mynhardt during which he is going to lose not only his farm but more importantly so his wife Elise, his daughter Ilse and his son Louis. What the nature of this loss is should not be disclosed here for the sake of those who haven't read the novel yet. But Mr Brink remarkably shows how a successful businessman - Martin is the chairman of the Mining Chamber of the Afrikaans Institute of Commerce, so he has, in his own words, "reached the top" - can irremediably ruin his relationship with his family and put his career at risk because of certain choices he made in the past. Mynhardt acknowledges this in the questions he asks at the last page of the novel: "Does one inevitably become the victim of one's own paradoxes in the end?"As Martin drives to his farm with his son Louis - hardly any conversation is possible between son and father since Louis was sent to fight in Angola - to convince his mother to sell it, he recollects the many acquaintances he had, the love affairs, his professional success. Many questions are posed in the novel, particularly those concerning the political situation in South Africa during the apartheid. Can any changes be brought about peacefully? What should the position of the White man be after so many years of discrimination, oppression and humiliation imposed on the Black peoples? Should one approve of any violent forms of action through which one can prove one's solidarity with the oppressed masses?"Rumours of Rain" is a very complex and powerful novel - the descriptions of townships like Soweto are literally breathtaking - like the continent in which it is set.

Catherine McKenna is a composer and a music teacher. She flies back home to Northern Ireland to attend her father's funeral. She is about to spend a few difficult days with her mother and sisters, a strictly catholic family, who run a pub. This is the occasion for Catherine to remember her childhood, her Granny Boyd, her first piano lesson with Miss Bingham, her musical studies in Belfast and the award she won for the excellence of her work which allowed her to travel to Kiev to visit the famous composer Melnichuck.She remembers how she met Dave, the father of her daughter Anna aged 18 months, a charming man who became a violent alcoholic. Catherine had to leave him and take refuge with her friend Liz in Glasgow.Catherine's sad and depressed existence is described with a very elegant delicacy. The 30 or so pages devoted to the way Catherine had to travel to the mainland to give birth to her daughter in the absence of Dave are of exceptional literary quality. Another strength of this novel are the numerous references to famous composers and musicians which are highly instructive without adding any weight to the plot. A highly recommended book.

Edmund Narraway, an engraver, is the narrator in this stunning novel by Iris Murdoch. One day he returns to his family house in northern England for the funeral of his recently deceased mother Lydia. Otto, Edmund's brother, a stone mason, still lives in the house with his wife Isabel and daughter Flora, along with Maria Magistrelli - Maggie - the nurse whom both Otto and Edmund consider as their second "mother". She is the Italian girl who brought up the two boys since neither their father John - a "nonentity" - nor Lydia - an intensely mean woman - took any part in their upbringing.Their childhood passed in an alternate frenzy of jealousy and of suffocation from their mother and Edmund feels that, although he didn't return to the house for many years, he never escaped from Lydia, that she got inside him, into the depth of his being and that there was no abyss and no darkness where she was not. And soon Edmund discovers that the remaining relatives still living in the old house are entangled in a web of deceit and false pretence. Flora is pregnant by David Levkin, Otto's apprentice, who is now having an affair with Isabel whereas Elsa, David's sister, is Otto's lover. Edmund quickly realises that his brother Otto, a violently tempered man, has become an alcoholic and he wonders whether he isn't himself rapidly becoming part of "the machine". Soon he feels agitated, exasperated and confused. He finds the whole situation "too scandalous, too outrageous". Edmund is constantly on the brink of leaving, not wanting "to be inside such a circle of hell". But due to his sympathy or weakness, he feels that his presence is needed by both his sister and his niece. But little does he know about the outcome of his stay at the old family house...Mrs Murdoch has been compared to Tolstoy and Dostoyevski for her literary skills and certainly "The Italian Girl" proves her capacity to show that being in love provides joy but can turn otherwise decent individuals into monsters of cruelty and blindness.

In the spring of 1974, Calliope Stephanides, a student at a girls' school in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, finds herself drawn to a chain-smoking, strawberry blonde classmate with a gift for acting. The passion that develops between them, along with Calliope's failure to develop, leads Calliope to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all but what the author calls the &quot;dritte Geschlecht&quot;.The explanation for this surprising fact is a rare genetic mutation and a guilty secret that has followed her grandparents from Greece to Detroit and beyond, outlasting the glorious days of the Motor City, the race riots of 1967, and the family's second migration, into the country known as suburbia. Because of the gene, Calliope is part girl, part boy. And even though the gene's epic travels have ended, her own odyssey has only begun.Spanning eight decades and an unusually awkward adolescence, &quot;Middlesex&quot; is a long fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender and the mysteries of desire.&quot;Middlesex&quot; is masterfully read by Kristoffer Tabori and I strongly recommend acquiring this audiobook along with the printed novel.

In the India of 1942 two rapes take place at the same time - that of the English girl Daphne Manners in Mayapore and that of India by the British. In each physical violence, racial animosity and the domination of the weak by the strong all play their part, but playing a part too are love, affection, loyalty and recognition that the last division of all to be overcome is the colour of the skin. As the story unfolds the whole spectrum of Anglo-Indian relations is vividly evoked in a flurry of emotions, personal clashes and historical reasons which eventually prise India - the Jewel in the Imperial Crown - from its setting.The two virtues of the novel are the colourful range of characters it skilfully portrays and its powerful evocation of the last days of British India, now quietly slipping away into history.

In her novel, Mrs Brookner portrays a middle-aged writer of romantic fiction, Edith Hope. People claim that there is a certain resemblance with Virginia Woolf in her features. At any rate her novels are published under the pen-name of Vanessa Wilde and they bear such titles as "The Sun at Midnight", "Beneath the Visiting Mood" or "The Stone and the Star". Edith doesn't seem to hold writing in high esteem. She describes this activity more like a compulsion: "she bent her head obediently to her daily task of fantasy and obfuscation", enjoying a rest "after her obscure and unnoticeable exertions". In fact she even considers reading as a kind of cure for the psychologically diseased: "Fiction, the time honoured resource of the ill-at-ease..."After settling down at the Hotel du Lac - set in a small village on the Swiss shore of lake Geneva - Edith meets her extravagant fellow lodgers: Iris Pusey and her daughter Jennifer, Mme de Bonneuil and Monica accompanied by her insufferable dog Kiki. During her numerous discussions with these women, Edith starts reflecting on the life she has led so far and on love in general. The reader also learns about her past and her troubled relationship with her mother. And it is not before the end of the novel that we discover why Edith came to the Hotel du Lac, why she left London in such a haste and what exactly the "unfortunate lapse" was which brought her to her temporary exile in Switzerland.Like one critic said about "Hotel du Lac": "Novels like Anita Brookner's are why we read novels".

The author starts by giving a definition of the concept of culture and states his intention to pursue an "archaeological" method in studying his subject. He then discusses the difference between cult and culture in which he sees religion as the guarantee of social knowledge and asserts that there can be no scientific culture because culture addresses the question of what we feel. Mr Scruton then proceeds by defining the Romantic movement in art and literature and linking it to the decline of Christian faith and the Enlightenment, the aesthetic thus replacing the religious. And so art and literature ceased to be recreation and became studies. Since the aesthetic is the realm of value, the question of taste arises. He underlines the importance of fiction in high culture because it is the product of the imagination. Art being the product of the human spirit, it is higher than nature and apart from it.Mr Scruton then concentrates on Romanticism which had nature, erotic love and the world before Enlightenment as its dominant themes. Works of art also pose the question of the importance of fantasy and imagination. Modernism is also discussed with the example of Baudelaire, then avant-garde and the concept of kitsch in which advertising is important because it creates a fantasy in which value can be purchased so that price and value are one and the same.The author then discusses the issue that the relationship between a painting or a novel and its subject is an intentional one, not a material one as opposed to photography.A further topic is modern music in which it is not the music that is the focus of attention but the singer himself. In the music of youth, the music is at the service of the performer and not the other way round.Finally the author concludes that culture is rooted in religion and that the role of modern high culture is to perpetrate the common culture not as a religion but as art.An interesting study of modern values and of the importance of aesthetic principles which shows that "culture" does not merely denote every kind of collective habit.

Sarah Barcant is a successful young lawyer in New York who grew up in Smitrivier, South Africa. One day she gets a call from Ben Hoffman, a retired lawyer who used to be Sarah's professional mentor, asking her to come back to Smitrivier to take up a case. And so after fourteen years, Sarah returns to the town where she grew up to do Ben a favour because she thinks she owes him so much. A policeman, Pieter Muller, is suspected of having killed James Sizela's son Steve during the Apartheid. Muller's culpability has been a belief in Smitrivier for thirteen years, ever since Steve was arrested on Pieter Muller's orders and then disappeared. So now the Truth Commission is James's last chance to find his son's body and have him properly buried. The timing appears to be perfect since the Truth Commission is about to deal with the jailed policeman Dirk Hendricks who applied for amnesty for the torture of Alex Mpondo, now an MP in the South African government. The plan is to use Alex Mpondo's presence at the hearing to threaten Hendricks that unless he reveals Pieter Muller's complicity in the murder of Steve Sizela, he may not get his amnesty. But the search for the truth is going to be far more arduous than Sarah imagined - perhaps even an impossible task.Mrs Slovo casts a merciless look at contemporary South Africa where heroism and perfidy are no longer distinct, where new truths are as painful as old lies, where torturers, once heroes, are now victims. An excellent novel which shows the absurd relationship between aggressors and victims and the power between the torturers and the tortured.

Joyce's book depicts episodes of middle-class Catholic life in Dublin at the beginning of last century; &quot;Dubliners&quot; was first published in 1914. The topics related in the opening stories range from the disappointments of childhood, the frustrations of adolescence and the importance of sexual awakening. Joyce was 25 when he wrote this miscellaneous collection of short stories, among which &quot;The Dead&quot; is probably the most famous. Considered at the time as a literary experiment, they are refreshingly original and astonishing ant the beginning of this century as they were at the beginning of last century!

Mr Graham Greene's short novel is set in Vienna just before the end of the Second World War. The city is described as &quot;smashed and dreary&quot; and when the action starts, Vienna is still divided up in zones among the Four Powers: the Russian, the British, the American and the French zones. Rollo Martins's line is the writing of cheap paperback Westerns under the penname of Buck Dexter. Martins received an invitation from Harry Lime of the International Refugee Office to join him in Vienna. When Martins arrives at the Hotel Asoria, there is no Lime expecting him, but only a cryptic message for Mr Dexter from a man called Crabbin. Martins then decides to look for Lime's apartment, but once he arrives there, a neighbour, a Herr Kurz, informs him that Harry Lime is dead after having been run over by a car. The burial is to take place the same afternoon at Vienna's Central Cemetery. Martins goes to the ceremony and immediately after that, he is accosted by a man called Calloway, a policeman from Scotland Yard, who asks him if he knew Harry Lime.This is the beginning of Graham Greene's classic espionage thriller, very well constructed with wonderfully drawn characters and a suspenseful plot.

The opening chapter of Dr. Yalom's psychological thriller introduces Dr. Ernest Lash, a young psychotherapist working in San Francisco, who has to deal with the case of Seymour Trotter, a 71-year-old colleague and former president of the American Psychiatric Association who is charged with sexual misconduct with a 32-year-old female patient. As Dr. Trotter recounts the events which lead to his being sentenced, one becomes aware of how deeply a patient can become involved both with his therapy and his therapist - it is no exaggeration to use the word obsession - so that the analyst is elevated to the figure of a deity and is blindly worshiped by the analysand.Then Dr Yalom introduces a set of characters whose paths cross at one point or another in the novel as the very skilfully woven plot unfolds. There is Justin who's been trapped in an impossible marriage for years and decides one day, out of the blue, to leave his wife Carol for another woman, having unexpectedly regained his self-confidence. Carol on her part holds Dr. Ernest Lash responsible for Justin's transformation and she decides to take revenge and to become Ernest's patient in order to seduce him and then to sue him for malpractice. But Ernest remains indomitable and Carolyn's - alias Carol's - vain sexual advances give rise to hilarious scenes.Dr Marshal Streider, Ernest's supervisor, helps to cure Shelly Merriman who can't prevent revealing his hand of cards on his face. Later, Marshal is involved in a fraud by a short-term "patient" in which he manages to lose first $ 90 000 and then another $ 24 000 in a "twice-bit gig" by the same man!Readers interested in psychology and psychoanalysis will enjoy this very meticulously designed story line with plenty of humour.

Berlin during World War II. A Swiss lady, Lucia Muller-Rossi, struggles along to make a living as a mistress to an ambassador and raise her son Nicholas. But soon Lucia discovers a new source of income: she becomes the guardian of all the lovely things - furniture, china, jewellery - that the Jews were forced to dispose of before being led to the death camps. Being Swiss, Lucia has no trouble at all leaving Germany and returning to Zurich, thus making the antiques her own property. Sixty years later, the owner of a small table happens to pass by the window of Lucia's shop ...&quot;The Pieces from Berlin&quot; can be read like a suspense story in which the reader glimpses the truth here and there as Mr Pye's characters struggle to answer the questions that thread through their lives: what are their obligations to their family members and to what lengths are they allowed to go to protect them? Like memories, the plot in this novel is a jigsaw puzzle which will eventually be completed in the denouement as the pieces neatly fall into place.

A remote leproserie in the Congo is the place where the protagonists meet in this novel by Graham Greene: Dr Colin, Querry, the Ryckers, Parkinson and Father Thomas. In the author's own words, in a letter addressed to Docteur Michel Lechat, the situation in the novel is an attempt to give dramatic expression to various types of belief, half belief and non-belief, in the kind of setting removed from world politics and household-preoccupations, where such differences are felt acutely and find expression. Indeed, exigencies of faith seem to be of little help in a place like the Congo in the 1950s, beset with disease and death as it then was.The corrupting presence of the journalist Montagu Parkinson who comes in search of the architect Querry and who alters the truth to hype things up is the reason why A Burnt-Out Case continues to be relevant today. This is also why this novel resembles Heart Of Darkness by J. Conrad and parallels can be drawn between Querry and Marlow: both have a sense of moral disgust and inner desolation. Thus Querry retreats to a kind of hell, the leprosarium, and finds a peace of sorts there, a respite that comes to and end with the arrival of Parkinson. Nevertheless Querry himself becomes a burnt-out case in the end, like a leper whose disease has run its course.Strong, powerful prose by one of the greatest British writers of the 20th century.

Various characters are more or less involved in the following incident: Jim Drover, a communist bus driver, killed a policeman during a riot at Hyde Park Corner because he thought that the policeman was going to attack his wife Milly. He is now in prison sentenced to death. Milly lives in a shabby, droughty house and although she loves his husband, she starts an affair with Jim's brother Conrad, a chief clerk at the Regal Assurance Company. Conrad is unsure whether, provided that Jim's appeal is successful, the alternative of spending 18 years in prison is a better one to being executed. In any case, his depression and hatred lead him to buying a gun and trying to kill the Assistant Commissioner without realising that the bullets in the guns are blanks. Then there is Mrs Coney, the dead policeman's wife, forced by Milly to sign a petition to save Jim from execution. And Kay Rimmer, Milly's sister, a worker at a match factory, a prostitute of sorts who frequently visits Mr Surrogate, writer of books of economics and socialist idealism.If "it's a battlefield", the reader may wonder what those protagonists are fighting for. Although Mr Greene casts a critical glance at institutions such as the Scotland Yard, trade unions, politics or the law, the characters' actions often appear to be meaningless. But perhaps this is the author's point: whatever the battle, one struggles in vain... "Brighton Rock" or "The Human Factor" are more carefully constructed novels in which Graham Greene showed his talent as a novelist.

In "Spider", Mr McGrath tells the harrowing story of a schizophrenic character called Dennis Cleg. He suffers from hallucinations - visual, auditory and olfactory - and from body delusions, he is physically regressed and has ideas of persecution. At the beginning of the novel, set in 1957, he lives in a shabby house along with other tenants, a "cargo of dead souls" as he calls the place, the landlady of which is a matronly figure, Mrs Wilkinson, who terrifies Cleg. As the story unfolds, the reader gets to know the circumstances which brought Cleg to live in this grimy place where "desolation prevails", in an area of London resembling "a clotted web of dark compartments." He feels that he would relish his solitude and memories were he not so easily thrown into turmoil by the latter. His existence is loveless, monotonous and grey as he often drifts further and further into the back parts of his mind where the reader follows him and tries to discern reality from delusion. A man like Cleg constantly lives in isolation, he has no friends, doesn't want any, doesn't like any. How could he, being permanently nagged by the certainty that others can destroy him with just a glance? From early childhood, being seen created in Cleg a deep sense of unease and he recalls imagining being "a coal-black boy who could move through darkness without being seen." Even years later "the misting and blurring of the visible world gave such comfort to the boy, and to the creature I have since become." Another reason for Cleg avoiding people is the frightening prospect of their thoughts invading his mind. "If I'm not careful these thought patterns of theirs crowd out my own, and I can't have that, I can't have other people's thoughts in my head."Apart from a brilliant psychological portrait of the schizophrenic mind, "Spider" is designed almost like a detective story in which the reader slowly discovers what happened to Cleg in his childhood, the time he spent in a mental institution and the subsequent years at Mrs Wilkinson's house. Highly recommended.

Another adventure with Patricia Highsmith's lovely character Thomas Ripley. This book follows the author's &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; so that the reader is already acquainted with most of the protagonists like Dick and Chris Greenleaf, Bernard Murchisson or Tom's wife Heloise. When Ed Banbury and Jeff Constant, owners of the Buckmaster Gallery in London, decide to open a new show featuring paintings by the famous Derwatt, the situation becomes uncomfortable when the American collector, Murchisson, claims that a painting he bought three years ago is a fake. Knowing that Derwatt died years ago in Greece and that Bernard had been forging paintings by &quot;Derwatt&quot;, allegedly living in a remote village in Mexico, it will take all of Ripley's talent to clean the reputation of the Buckmaster Gallery, as Murchisson's visit to London is imminent. Mrs Highsmith's highly successful ingredients are all present in this novel: crime, horror, humour and suspense.Nigel Lambert reading Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; is a masterpiece. All the humour and suspense is rendered splendidly by Mr Lambert's beautiful reading.

A train leaves Palermo on 23 July for a long slow trip along the single-track line through the interior of Sicily and then disappears from official view for the best part of a week until 29 July.One wagon is found in a station called Passo Martino, south of Catania, and when people report to the police that a dreadful smell emanates from the wagon, Carmen Consuela is sent to investigate the matter. The results of the examination show that a corpse has been rotting inside the wagon for at least a week. Apparently the victim was riding inside the wagon when the door closed thus locking the intruder inside. In the sealed metal freight wagon standing for days at a time on isolated sidings in the glare of the sun, a hypothetical thermometer might well have shown temperatures in the mid-forties.In the absence of any information it would be almost impossible to identify the victim except for a mysterious scribble in the contents box on the wagon's way bill which is eventually deciphered as being not limoni - lemons - but Liminia. Could this refer to the Liminia family in Catania who run one of the principal Mafia clans in that city and in Torino? Is the victim the eldest son and presumptive heir who has been rumoured to be missing for over a week?Set against the backdrop of the 3000-year-old city of Catania and in the shadow of the smouldering volcano of Etna, Mr Dibdin's book reveals Aurelio Zen in one of his toughest and most dangerous case.

Mr Strauss's story about the two Siamese twins Chang and Eng Bunker, linked at the chest, did actually live between 1811 and 1874. They were born in Siam, they met the King of Siam, they came to America and became celebrities, they married two sisters and were fathers of 21 children and lead a life as farmers in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Mr Strauss's novel is not ruled by historical facts and thus most of its characters and situations are the product of his imagination, making &quot;Chang and Eng&quot; a true work of fiction. The author thoughtfully explores the questions of union and separation, of individual identity and of the means one has to share and protect one's identity.

Francis Andrews is on the run because he informed against a gang of smugglers of spirits - of which he used to be a member - by means of an anonymous letter to the customs, resulting in the death of a ganger who was shot during a set up. Now Carlyon and his men are after Andrews to take revenge. One night, as he is fleeing from his pursuers, Andrews comes across a cottage in Hassocks where he is given shelter by the beautiful Elizabeth Garnet.As Elizabeth slowly grows to trust Andrews, she learns from him about his past, his violent father, smuggler and owner of the ship "Good Chance" with which he used to transported brandy to England. He also tells her how, after his father's death, he met Carlyon who suggested that he joins the crew. Andrew then tells Elizabeth how deeply he detested these men because he could never ascertain himself in front of them the way his father had. Betraying them was thus a way for him to show his fellow smugglers that he "is of importance now".It is then that Elizabeth suggests that Andrews go to Lewes the following day where the Assizes are to be held and bear his witness to show his courage. Indeed, a difficult and dangerous decision for Andrews to take...A powerful novel about courage, cowardice, love and faith. It is commendable that Mr Greene achieved to write such a mature novel at the age of only 23.

During the summer of 1976, Adam Verne-Smith inherits a big old country house in Suffolk, Wyvis Hall. He collects around him a group of shady and careless young people: Rufus, Shiva, Vivien and Zosie. With carelessness of youth they plunder, steal, pawn, scavenge and sell the family heirlooms. In 1986 the bodies of a young woman and child are discovered in a strange animal cemetery by the owners of Wyvis Hall. Adam, Rufus and the others have reasons to fear as the truth about what happened at Wyvis Hall in 1976 slowly comes to light.The characters are not particularly well drawn, the plot a succession of banal events. Although Mrs Vine is interested in borderline personalities, the psychology of her characters in this novel can be described as uninteresting at best.

Mr Yates's stories deal with a variety of situations, most of which we as readers have experienced in life ourselves. There are the teenagers and their reluctance to accept the authority of their teachers or parents, the loss of freedom resulting from marriage, the pain people can feel, both physical and emotional, memories from childhood or the army. There are the inevitable haunted, vulnerable and dependent characters. In some short stories, writers appear, too: &quot;Writers who write about writers can bring on the worst kind of miscarriage.&quot; writes one of them! There is the pleasure given to children by their father?s visitation days, his hugs and their smells of linen, whisky and tobacco. In the stories collected under the title &quot;Liars in Love&quot;, couples separating is a frequent - almost repetitive - topic. It seems to me that once you have reached a certain age and experience in life, Mr Yates's prose simply confirms your own feelings and seems, not downright commonplace, but lacking in originality. In this literary genre, it is my opinion that Raymond Carver, Nadine Gordimer or Jhumpa Lahiri are more enjoyable authors.

Eric O'Brien is an uncertain and awkward young man, a would-be writer and a traveller in spite of himself.

He finds himself in a curious quest for his own family in a ghost mining town, now barely inhabited, where almost a hundred years earlier young Cornish miners worked the rich seams in the earth. Until Pancho Villa and revolution came to Mexico.A recording of this novel is available from BBC Audiobooks and Eleanor Bron's reading is truly breathtaking. Highly recommended.

In this valuable study Dr Goffman examines what happens when an individual appears in front of others. Usually the individual mobilizes his activity in order to convey an impression to others which it is in his interest to convey. This process is called impression management and it occurs in practically every social interaction. Each participant is expected to suppress his feelings and to convey a view of the situation which he feels the others will at least temporarily find acceptable.We all perform in front of others and we expect that others believe the performance we deliver. Everyone more or less consciously is always playing a role, is always presenting a personal front which is both behavioural and material - clothing, size, posture, hair, make-up and gesture. Performers tend to offer their observers an impression that is as positive as possible, mostly even idealised. A slight error or off key note can disrupt an entire performance and of course the performer can act so as to dupe or misguide his audience in which case self-deception is not excluded.Social distance usually leads to a process of mystification whereas excessive familiarity may breed contempt. In the absence of the other, with a third party, belittling and criticism - secret derogation - often take place and is even in many cases a source of contentment. The author distinguishes four types of communication out of character: staging talk, team collusion, treatment of the absent and realigning actions. A study which will interest all those who would like to know what phenomena occur during a variety of social interactions.

A man returns to the town where the murder of Santiago Nasar took place 27 years before. Santiago Nasar got up at five-thirty in the morning on the Monday he was going to be killed by the twins Pedro and Pablo Vicario. The narrator is told by Placida Linero, Santiago Nasar's mother, that within the hour, her 21 year old son would be dead. Why did the twins want to kill the proprietor of The Divine Face, the ranch he had inherited from his father? Why did they chose that particular morning, when the bishop was due to visit the village? Why wasn't Santiago Nasar aware of the fact that somebody had shoved an envelope under the door of his house with a written document warning him that he was going killed, stating in addition the place, the motive and other quite precise details of the plot? How could the murder have been committed despite the fact that nearly all the inhabitants of the town knew that it was inevitably going to happen? The investigation of this murder takes the quality of a hallucinatory exploration into the past. The narrator's quest for the truth leads him into the darkness of human intentions, a truth that perpetually seems to slither away. This small masterpiece is one of the greatest classics of the 20th century.

Sarah Elizabeth Jane is an editor with &quot;The Modern Review&quot;. When her friend the novelist John Slater suggests that she joins him on a trip to Kuala Lumpur, Sarah does not know the maze she is about to enter, &quot;from which, thirteen years later, I haven't yet escaped&quot; as she puts it. Shortly after their arrival in Kuala Lumpur, Sarah makes the acquaintance of an Australian in a shabby bicycle repair shop in Jalan Campbell, a man called Christopher Chubb. She soon finds out that he is the villain in the McCorkle Hoax dating back to 1946. Chubb gave birth to a phantom poet called &quot;Bob McCorkle&quot; who never existed but whom the Australian gave a life, a death and a biography. He then delivered a collection of poems called &quot;Personae&quot; to editor David Weiss, a man profoundly detested by Chubb since their common schooldays at Forest Street. Sarah is speechless as Chubb mockingly recites a passage from a poem called &quot;Swamps&quot;: &quot;Areas of stagnant water serve / As breeding grounds...&quot;, a passage Chubb had copied from an army manual of mosquito eradication! When Weiss published &quot;Personae&quot;, he was arrested and prosecuted for &quot;obscenity&quot;. As Sarah listens to the beginning of Chubb's account of his life, she is drawn into his harrowing narration. Chubb has a kind of magnetic effect on her and she can't resist wanting to learn more about Chubb's past, a maze of events on the verge of credibility. A beautifully crafted piece of storytelling, a powerful work of fiction, Mr Carey's narrative is fast, furious and haunting.

This book was originally published in 1845 and remains to this day a work of reference. It portrays all the essential stations in the life of this composer of great genius. The reason why Holmes's biography is so valuable is no doubt the fact that the author uses large excerpts of Mozart's correspondence and his letters give precious information about the man himself. Edward Holmes then adds precious data concerning dates, names, musicians, places and customs of the late 18th century.There is also an appendix listing all of Mozart's works and their date of composition as well as a useful index.The book is masterfully read by David Case for Tantor Media.

The author shows how philosophy supplied Socrates with convictions in which he was able to have rational confidence when faced with adversity. In Socrates' time, the opinion of the majority was equated with truth. He thus suffered the sad fate to be good and yet judged evil. We should therefore strive to listen to the dictates of the reason and not the dictates of public opinion.The philosophy of Epicures places an emphasis on the importance of sexual pleasure and he promises that philosophy will guide us to superior cures and true happiness. Friendship and freedom are the two most important items on the Epicurean acquisition list.Seneca conceived of philosophy as a discipline to assist human beings in overcoming conflicts between their wishes and reality. He saw that we must reconcile ourselves to the necessary imperfectability of existence. We will cease to be angry once we cease to be too hopeful.Cicero claims that scholarship furnishes us with true means of living well and happily, to spend our lives without discontent and without vexation.Montaigne saw that we have to accept our body with all its flaws: it smells, aches, ages, throbs and pulses.Booksellers are the most valuable destination for the lonely, given the number of books that were written because authors couldn't find anyone to talk to. Actually every difficult work presents us with the choice whether to judge the author inept for not being clear, or ourselves stupid for not understanding the ideas.For Schopenhauer, a man of genius can hardly be sociable, for what dialogues could indeed be so intelligent and entertaining as his own monologues? For him, art and philosophy help us to turn pain into knowledge. "The prudent man strives for freedom from pain, not pleasure."

Set in Kabul under the rule of the Taliban regime, this impressive novel takes us into the lives of two couples: Mohsen Ramat, who comes from a family of wealthy shopkeepers whom the Taliban has destroyed; Zunaira, his beautiful wife, who was once a brilliant teacher and is now no longer allowed to leave her home without an escort or covering her face with a burqa. Intersecting their world is Atiq Shaukat, a prison keeper, a man who has sincerely adopted the Taliban ideology and struggles to keep his faith, and his wife, Musarrat, who once rescued Atiq and is now dying of sickness and despair.Desperate and exhausted Mohsen wanders through Kabul when he is surrounded by a crowd about to stone an adulterous woman. Numbed by the hysterical atmosphere of the crowd and drawn into their rage, he too throws stones at the face of the condemned woman buried up to her waist. With this gesture the lives of all four characters move toward their destinies.The novel shows in a realistic way how women survive in a world where they can be beaten up for laughing with their husband. It shows a country where people have been deprived of almost everything. Where the Taliban rule, love between a man and a woman, joy, music, freedom have been banned, replaced by violence and hatred, all in the name of God. A stunning read of high literary quality.

First the author traces back the origins of the fast food industry with the brothers McDonald. The fast spreading of food chains has wiped out many small businesses and eliminated regional differences scattering identical stores throughout the US. Customers today are drawn to familiar brands in food by an instinct to avoid the unknown.Mr Schlosser then discusses marketing issues and it is interesting to know that 3.5 million fast food workers are by far the largest group of minimum wage earners in the US. He also explains why these jobs are particularly sought after by high school students.The author describes in full detail the atrocious working conditions in the meat packing industry. Farmers and cattle ranchers are losing their independence essentially becoming hired hands for the agribusiness giants.The fast food industry has been a catalyst to the malling and sprawling of the West and has played a central role in the rise of franchising and the spread of obesity.A very interesting study for readers who would like to give fast food a thought before ordering their next hamburger.

Olivia Rivers, married to Douglas, a civil servant in India, caused a scandal in 1923 in the small town of Satipur when she eloped with and Indian prince. In the 1970s, Olivia's step-granddaughter goes back to the heat and dust of Satipur to solve the mystery of the outrage caused by Olivia's flight.Mrs Jhabvala's novel sounds like a warning. Both Olivia and the narrator do not seem to withstand India because they are fine and sensitive people who come to love the country very much, too much perhaps. Indeed there are many things to love in India: the landscapes, the history, the music and the physical beauty of men and women which may become a danger to the European. The characters in this novel are immersed by the Indian culture - and in Olivia's case, destroyed by it - they seem to be softened by an excess of feeling for India and finally they are dragged over to the other side. But according to Mrs Jhabvala's description of India - the smells, the sounds, the poverty, the filth, the beggars and cripples - it is difficult to imagine that Europeans can be as totally immersed in that culture as were both Olivia and the narrator. Is it plausible at all that such a foreign culture can be powerful enough to lead one to perdition?

What better victim in a Robert Barnard mystery than a literary poseur? And what better place to find such character than a society set up in the honour of the dubiously talented authors Susannah and Joshua Sneddon?These two authors toiled in the early years of the 20th century at their creative tasks in a remote cottage of Mikelwike, a small village in Yorkshire. Neither wrote masterpieces but Susanna's books were always more popular than her brother's. That's perhaps why Joshua one day killed his sister with an axe and then shot himself in the head.Many years later, there is a renewed interest in the Sneddons, inspired by entrepreneur Gerald Suzman. He bought the Sneddon cottage, with plans to open a museum and to found a literary society called the Sneddon Fellowship. Sneddon enthusiasts from as far away as America, Norway and Japan gather at Suzman's invitation for the inauguration of the society during a Sneddon Weekend. DC Charlie Peace joins the party, intrigued by Suzman's unexpected literary interest in the Sneddond. Suzman's history shows a far greater penchant for wealth than literature, so he must have discovered a source of profit in the Fellowship. But where?Charlie fears that an elderly American lady called Lettie Farraday may know too much for her own good. Lettie, who has returned to Mikelwike, the village of her birth, for the first time in fifty years, is the only conferee who personally knew the Sneddons. Too much knowledge may be dangerous...

The "Mary Deare" was a 6000-ton freighter which emerged one night from severe Biscay gales into the English Channel, and into the newspaper headlines. It falls to John Sands, a salvage operator, to investigate what had happened to her. The damage sustained by the ship in the forward holds, the water making headway against the pumps, the shoring of the stoke-hold bulkhead, the fire in the radio shack, the disappearance of crew member Dellimare, the fire in number three hold and the subsequent abandonment of the ship by all except the captain. A disaster resulting in the death of twelve men during a mad scramble to get away from the "Mary Deare" that, in point of fact, was in no immediate danger of sinking...

Humphrey James Barclay is onboard a flight from Ndanga to London when he starts bleeding uncontrollably, passing out almost immediately. Among the passengers is Dr Palmer who diagnoses haemorrhagic fever, one of its from being known as Ebola, an extremely contagious disease. Although every precaution is taken after the plane has landed in Heathrow, several passengers, Dr Palmer and a stewardess die a few days later of the same symptoms as Barclay because they had come close to the sick man without any protection. Dr Steven Dunbar, a Sci-Med investigator, is commissioned to investigate the case and when a post-mortem is performed on Barclay's body, a filovirus is discovered as being the cause for his haemorrhagic fever.

Even more surprising is the fact that a young woman, Ann Danby, is found dead in her flat in Manchester, also having succumbed to haemorrhagic fever. As more and more cases are reported with completely unrelated patients throughout the British Isles, a race against time starts for Dr Dunbar and his colleagues to find and eradicate the mysterious disease.An entertaining medical thriller in the same vein as Michael Palmer or Robin Cook.

Dorothea May is a 70-year old widow living in an Edwardian mansion block in London. She enjoys living alone and her social life is limited to her former husband's cousins Kitty and Molly. She enjoys silence because she knows that the end of her life is approaching. She is shy of affectionate gestures and enjoys fiction and radio more than the company of people because no response is called for.She often recalls how she met her husband Henry and she doesn't seek joy anymore, settling instead for reasonable satisfaction. Her girlhood was innocent of sexual involvement, like that of a Victorian maiden.One day Kitty announces that her granddaughter Ann is to come to London to marry David. They're both coming with a friend, Steve Best, and it is Kitty's whish that Mrs May puts Steve up in her flat for a week. At first Mrs May refuses but then. The ensuing few days she spends with her lodger will change Mr May's life considerably.In this remarkable novel, the author shows that if the gregarious fear loneliness, to the solitary the gregarious pose a much greater threat. She also shows that a young man's objections to the old are likely to be predominantly physical as well as moral.

In this stunning novel, Mr Galgut tells the story of a fugitive from justice hitchhiking in the desolate backdrop of South Africa and who is picked up by a driver, a minister on his way to a remote parish. When the minister discovers that the hitchhiker is a fugitive and confronts him in a disused quarry, the response is lethal.This novel is a masterpiece featuring a story and characters utterly compelling. The author shows that even the quietest spots on earth can seethe with repressed violence. A blunt and tense read about guilt and evasion of truth. Justly enough, Mr Galgut has been compared to the greatest South African writers like Andr? Brink, Nadine Gordimer, J.M. Coetzee and Achmat Dangor.

Laurence Waters is working in a rundown hospital in the capital of what used to be one of the homelands of South Africa. These areas of land are impoverished and underdeveloped, set aside by the apartheid government for the self determination of its various black nations. As Frank Eloff joins the staff of five for a one year training, he soon discovers that there is virtually no activity at the hospital. Most of the people living in the abandoned town - built once by what Laurence terms as "a puppet dictator" - aren't even aware of the presence of the facility! The equipment is so flimsy that most cases have to be referred to a hospital in a town an hour away.Nevertheless, Mr Galgut masterfully describes the relationships between the staff members, at times showing harmony, at times tension and discord. Laurence's thoughts are busy with his failed marriage, with his father resenting him for being what one may call a loser - he ironically talks about "such wonderful work you do up there amongst the rural blacks" - or with his memories of the two years he spent in the army.An altogether impressive read, atmospheric with the heavy heat of South Africa, its political and racial issues and the permanent threat of violence which many authors associate with their country in their novels - J.M. Coetzee, Andr&eacute; Brink, Nadine Gordimer or Doris Lessing to name but a few.

While hunting near the Rio Grande Llewlyn Moss stumbles upon a heroin transaction gone wrong: trucks shot up and several dead bodies, some of them Mexican. Inside one of the trucks Moss finds a leather document case level full of hundred dollar banknotes in packets fastened with bank tape stamped each with the denomination $ 10,000. When Moss decides to leave the scene of the crime with the money little does he suspect that this is the beginning of a wild and bloody manhunt between him and Anton Chigurh who is determined to get hold of the money.Although a standard western good-guy bad-guy plot at first sight, this novel is serious literature with an absorbing and chilling plot which can be seen as a study of a burning American rage and how common that rage has become. Chigurh is a truly sinister character and the novel meditates on the fight between good and evil in men and society. McCarthy's language is stunningly economical. Characters are often defined by a single line of conversation and places made vivid within the confine of a sentence. And he is very good at capturing the tenor of the south Texan dialogue.

Mr Marquez based his narrative on the true story of 8 members of the destroyer "Caldas" of the Colombian Navy who fell overboard during a storm in the Caribbean Sea on February 28, 1955. It is a journalistic account of the survival of the only one of the eight men, Luis Alejandro Velaso, who managed to reach a life raft and survived ten days with neither food nor water until he drifted to the Colombian coast and was rescued by a group of villagers.The narration is incredibly gripping considering that practically nothing happens to Luis during the ten days he spent on the raft. There is only the sea, the sky, the stars, the fish, the gulls and a lonely man lost at sea. It shows what a genial storyteller Mr Marquez is, a true virtuoso of the word. In the same vein, it is worth mentioning "The Life of Pi" by Yann Martel.

Iain Levison can find work but not fulfilment. The frustration of dead-end, deadhead labour induces a frustration syndrome as the realization sets in that his college degree in English literature will gain him little by way of psychic wages on the job. He is adrift in a workaday world where one human is as good as the next and all are expendable. Meaningless promises abound, "like when they were telling us [at commencement that] we were the future of the world". In ten years, Iain Levison has lived in six states and worked at forty-two jobs; from fish cutter in Alaska to furniture mover in North Carolina, film-set gopher, oil deliveryman, truck driver, and crab fisherman. He quit thirty of them, got fired from nine, and has difficulty remembering the other three. Whatever could go wrong often did, hilariouslyIt is a funny book about the not-so-funny American workplace. The real thing, written not by a high-priced journalist disguised as a counter clerk, or a tenured professor passing as a vagrant, but by a genuine wage-dependent, red-blooded working stiff too "rich" for welfare and too broke to fit a consumer demographic. He works to keep his car running to get back and forth from work. He works to get by and get back for the next day's labours.

Tom Richards is a sixty-three year old film director. He feels like a God up on his crane, shouting orders through his amplifier and, like God, watching the team group and regroup as bidden, especially the stars. So when Tom falls off the crane and breaks twelve ribs as well as his hip, it is quite a tragedy for him.His new film, Hamburger Girl, is cancelled and then renamed, members of Tom's family vanish then reappear and his life is far from ordinary, something which seems to be the case with most people in the film business.As Tom says, nothing with him is consistent. It is typical of him and in a way a part of the moves of that world of dreams and reality which he is at home in, the world of filming scenes, casting people in parts, piecing together types, facts and illusions.At some point Tom says that what he and his crew are doing is real and not real. They live in a world where dreams are reality and reality is dreams. In their world, everything starts from a dream.A lovely kaleidoscope of witty characters and situations, this novel is thoroughly enjoyable and no doubt shows that the author was still at the top of her form in 1996.

In her sensitive tale, Mrs Fox tells the story of a young boy of thirteen, Jessie Bollier. He's growing up in New Orleans at the time when slavery is still flourishing in the United States and he is often to be seen playing his flute in the "Vieux Carr&eacute;".Jessie is kidnapped by two men and brought on board "The Moonlight", a slaver which is about to sail to Africa. The trade is called "Black Gold" by Captain Cawthorne, an illegal venture making him no better than a pirate. He tells Jessie that he was kidnapped to work with the Blacks as a slave dancer on the vessel, playing his pipe, "because it keeps them happy since it is hard to make a profit out of a sick nigger". As the long voyage begins, Jessie is about to discover the atrocious business of slavery.The originality of Mrs Fox's novel is that the events are seen and experienced by a thirteen year old boy. His navet&eacute; is funny and touching in many situations and lightens the tone of this otherwise sombre tale.

In his first novel, David Mason creates a beautifully enchanting adventure narrative, weaving both historical facts and a marvellous plot. Edgar Drake's progress through Burma as he tries to reach the village of Mae Lwin is both suspenseful and instructive for the European reader. Mr Mason's very well documented novel allows the reader to discover a lot about the Indian continent, the technique of piano tuning and the brutalities and compromises of colonisation. A truly beautiful book.

In this delightful novel, Mr Wolff tells the story of a boy called Lambert attending an elite prep school in New England in the 1960s. At that establishment, it is the tradition that one pupil should be granted a private audience with a visiting author provided that a piece of his or her own work wins the competition. The winner is chosen by the author and the pupil's work is then published in the school newspaper. When the visit of Ernest Hemingway is announced, Lambert struggles along with his competitors George Kellog, Bill White and Jeff Purcell to win the honour of meeting the famous writer in private. Unfortunately Lambert chooses a not quite honest way of winning the competition which results in his being expelled from school.Apart from the plot which magnificently describes life at school at that time, Mr Wolff poses interesting questions. What is an author? How does the desire to create arise? How many of those who have literary ambitions will eventually succeed? How can an aspiring writer fight the writer's block? The author also shows that the topics of truth and fiction and of honesty and delusion are slippery ones. One wonders indeed if it is possible to tell the truth in writing and if, in art in general, there is any truth at all. In this sense, the main character in "Old School" is perhaps not Lambert but literature itself. One quality this novel certainly possesses is stylistic restraint with every sentence having a rare and high precision.

This edition features all the short stories written by the author. Here is a small selection of those I've enjoyed most.In "Under The Garden" William Wilditch, after spending a long time abroad, is now visiting the family house, Winton Hall, which he hasn't seen since his childhood and where his brother George lives. After the first night, Wilditch finds it difficult to distinguish between memories and fantasy, fact and dream. He remembers a dream he had as a child when he entered a dark cave on the island in the middle of the pond in the garden. In that cave he met two rogues: Javitt, a sententious old man who had lived there for many years with a mute woman, Mary.In "A Visit To Morin" a narrator, Dunlop, remembers admiring a French author called Pierre Morin who was controversial in the 1950s because he was accused of Jansenism while others called him an Augustinian. Dunlop spots Morin at a Midnight Mass in a village near Colmar. After introducing himself to the author, he is invited to his house where they have an astonishing conversation during which Morin reveals to Dunlop that long after he ceased to believe in God, he still remains a carrier of belief through his books.A patient suffering from leprosy in "Dream Of A Strange Land" in Switzerland is driven to a desperate action because he can't get his doctor's help. Indeed the doctor's house has been transformed into a casino to accommodate the Herr General, now too weak to travel to Monte Carlo. Not only does the patient think he went to the wrong house but he thinks he is in the wrong country as well, Germany probably...In "A Discovery In The Woods" a group of strange children with short and uneven limbs who move like crabs decide that they should enter a new territory in search of blackberries. Thus they leave the confines of their village, Bottom, and they discover an enormous house resembling a giant stranded fish which seems to have been thrown up among the rocks to die.An "old sterile thing" is the way the American woman in "Beauty" is described. She is desperately calling after her Pekinese dog Beauty in the night. But Beauty left her mistress for a well deserved nocturnal ramble in the dirt of the city.Madame Volet in "Chagrin In Three Parts" lost her husband to Emmy with whom he fell in love. Her friend Madame Dejoie tries to console her by suggesting that satisfaction can be achieved if only one can discover in oneself "the capacity for love" for another woman!Henry Cooper in "The Overnight Bag" travels on a BEA flight from Nice to London carrying in his BOAC overnight bag what he claims to be his wife's "dead baby".In "Mortmain" Philip Carter's new marriage to Julia is jeopardised by a series of notes hidden in their apartment by his former wife Josephine.Mary Watson in "Cheap In August" is taking a holiday in Jamaica where she meets an unhappy and lonely American, Henry Hickslaughter. Because Mary really went on holiday to look for an adventure she can't help feeling that her attachment to the old man is cheap in the same way as everything is cheap in Jamaica in August.A young woman author appraised by her publisher for her "power of observation" turns out to have no power of observation whatsoever in "The Invisible Japanese Gentlemen".In "Awful When You Think Of It" a man on a train has an imaginary dialogue with a fellow passenger's baby and he tries to picture what kind of adult that baby will become."Doctor Crombie" portrays a school doctor living at the beginning of the 20th century who is convinced that there is a correlation between sexual intercourse and cancer: "Almost one hundred percent of those who die of cancer have practised sex" he claims!In "Two Gentle People" Marie-Claire Duval and Henry Graves meet in the Parc Monceau in Paris, then have dinner together only to realise that the hour came too late in both their lives...A wonderful collection of short stories by one of the greatest British authors of the 20th century.

Is the hero a positive or negative character in a novel? Mr Coetzee doesn't really seem to care by choosing Paul Rayment, the main character in Slow Man, a bland man for a novelist. He is a former photographer in Adelaide, he is divorced without children and rather old fashioned with the habits of a typical bachelor.After a bicycle accident which leads to the amputation of one of his legs he becomes infatuated with his Croatian nurse Marijana. Are such events likely to turn Paul Rayment into a hero? Probably not. But in the hands of a writer like J.-M. Coetzee they certainly are. It is the writer's skill to create a novel on the basis of the most banal events. It is the faculty to cast a particular glance on things and events which introduces depth into banality of everyday events.It all starts with the apparitions of Elizabeth Costello in the life of Paul Rayment: a respected and intelligent author if a little moralizing at times who wishes to make him one of his characters in her novel, an idea Paul vehemently opposes. Using this strange situation Coetzee poses the question of convention: who is whose character? How does a plot arise? What right do authors have to impart emotions on people other than themselves? But the discussion of these issues doesn't prevent Slow Man from being a true work of fiction with characters adorned with remarkable personalities. This is due to the fact that they are drawn from two sides: from the exterior, in an apparently indifferent way, and from within with their most intimate preoccupations.Ultimately the question of literary creation leads to another question in this novel in which there is a lot of reflecting on life and death: are we God's characters as much as Paul Rayment and Eliyabeth Costello and others are the novelist's characters?

Jake Burnett is a freelance journalist working for a New York paper, the &quot;Ledger&quot;. Since being a high school senior, Jake has always been a passionate admirer and reader of Horace Jacob Little's fiction. This author is much talked about because he is famous for the strange circumstances of his personality, his seclusion and his solitude. In fact, since nobody has ever approached him, Horace Jacob Little is not much more than a fiction himself. His true identity is a mystery, not even his literary agents have ever met him since they only communicate with him via a post office box. All of his books only feature a blank cover. There are no illustrations, no biographies and no photographs of Horace Jacob Little. He has never granted an interview and no one knows what he looks like or where he lives.One morning at Princeton university, Jake attends a lecture given by Professor Mullin about the works of Horace Jacob Little when suddenly a man inches up the side aisle, climbs onto the stage and, after a few confused sentences, identifies himself as Horace Jacob Little. But is it really him? Jake's startled and hyperalert classmate Andrew Wallace has no doubt about it: &quot;If this isn't Horace Jacob Little, then who is? Who is??And so begins Jake's awkward search of Horace Jacob Little. Perhaps Andrew's &quot;Confessions&quot; which he wrote at the Overlook Psychiatric Institute - a place for the artistic mentally ill, a house full of painters, musician and writers - also called The Muse Asylum and in which he purports to reveal the secret of Horace Jacob Little's identity will be of some help for Jake...A very ingeniously plotted postmodernist literary thriller.

The author portrays an unnamed narrator living in an Austrian village in a "mind-hostile and mood-killing neighbourhood". He lives in nearly total isolation having given up all contacts for the sake of his intellectual work. But eventually his contactlessness proves a catastrophe bringing him to the verge of madness, insanity and suicide. For three months he never leaves his house, full of fear, in a kind of self-incarceration.One night, seeking the help of the only person he trusts, a real-estate agent called Moritz, the narrator becomes acquainted with an odd couple: a Swiss and his Persian wife who have just arrived in the village to buy a plot for the construction of their house. He finds the Persian woman a regenerating thinking, talking and philosophising partner who saves him from depression and during their conversations he discovers why the Swiss came there to buy a plot which has a marked slope, a high degree of dampness and where snow clearance is impossible in the winter.A work in which nihilism finds its most uncompromising expression, which presents a human situation devoid of any meaning and which shows that speech is a useless therapy to fend off death. From this perspective there is only one possible answer to the ultimate question.

One evening, the narrator, Dr. Petrie, is invited by his friend Denis Nayland Smith who has just returned from Burma. Smith, exceedingly nervous, shows him the hideous wound on his left arm which he cauterised after being shot at by a mysterious man with an arrow imbibed with the venom extracted from the poison-glands of a hamadryad, one of the most poisonous snakes of the East. Smith believes that this fiend is now in London and that his next victim is likely to be Sir Crichton Davey who held office in India some time ago. Indeed that same evening Sir Crichton is found dead in his house with a strange red mark like the imprint of painted lips. According to his private secretary Mr Burboyne, Sir Crichton shouted "the red hand" just before dying... Could it be the work of "Dr. Fu-Manchu, the yellow peril incarnate in one man"?A super-villain, oriental poisons, extraordinary rites, stalwart British heroes who face danger for the King and motherland, such are the ingredients in Sax Rohmer's (a pseudonym for Arthur Sarsfield Ward) novel along with stereotypes such as "the most inscrutably mysterious race, the Chinese" which do not present the Asians in a very positive light. But readers should not forget that this novel was first published in 1913.

This collection of short stories features quite a range of memorable characters and situations. Blind willows have a lot of pollen and tiny flies covered with it crawl inside the ear of a woman and put her asleep. A waitress about to spend her twentieth birthday in a surprising manner. A man who has the astonishing habit of going to the zoo whenever there is a typhoon. The story of a mirror capable of reflecting another self. The strange story of a disabled son and her mother holidaying on an island.In many of these stories, narrative tension is heightened by a refusal to explain strange events; Murakami's ghosts and mysteries remain what they are. In "Nausea 1979" for example, the reader will never know whether a serial adulterer has been cursed, or whether his nausea has something to do with his predilection for deceptive seduction. Murakami never gives answers to the reader's questions, and the result is memorable if puzzling at times.The stories in this collection have all of Murakami's characteristic strangeness, but they combine the bizarre with a tight structure. They show the author at his best; not as a cult literary figure but as a really first-rate writer of short fiction. Highly recommended.

The world's diamond industry is about to explode into anarchy. In the frozen north of Archangel, a new mine is yielding the most beautiful and rare stone in the world - the red diamond. And Karakov, the greatest and wiliest jeweller the industry has ever seen, is about to sign an exclusive agreement with Moscow.From all over the world the directors of Diamond Enterprises gather to try and stop Karakov destabilising the diamond trade. But there is deceit and betrayal even within their own group. For Julius Heyderman is determined to destroy his life-long enemy, the man who runs the British end of the business, Arthur Harris.All the members of the board have their tortured secrets - Reece, Heyderman's right-hand man, is locked into a relationship he cannot control; Kruger has dumped his wife of thirty years for his secretary, Ruth Fraser; and Ray Andrews, who is being sent back to Moscow to try to salvage the deal he botched five years before.And then there is James Hastings, young, aggressive and ambitious. James is prepared to sacrifice everything to succeed - everything except his beautiful aristocratic wife. Elizabeth is his Achille's heel. And behind the panic-driven plots of Diamond Enterprises looms the spectre of Karakov, Russian by descent, the most brilliant plotter of them all...The book is very well read by British actress Sian Thomas and her voice is a prefect complement to the printed novel.

In Mr Cunningham's novel we follow the lives of two boyhood friends Jonathan and Bobby. The former is rather shy, he likes to play with a doll and enjoys indoor games whereas the latter has a bolder character. They grow up in Cleveland and experience the kind of "reckless overnight friendship particular to those who are young." After college they move to New York where they live in an improbable m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with a girl called Clare. A few years later they move to the country where "their" - there are two likely fathers - daughter Rebecca is born.The novel features an endless succession of rather banal events, people moving in different directions never quite knowing what their destination should be or what motivates them to do what they are doing. What is the author talking about? Is he describing the love between teenage boys? Their relationship with their parents? Their parents slowly becoming old? A couple of gay men living together with a woman? A woman who inexplicably wishes to have a child by a gay father? A trio trying to raise a child? Unfortunately there is no answer to these interesting issues in the novel because the author keeps the text at the level of mere actions, never pausing to reflect more deeply on what motivates people to perform a particular action. An altogether disappointing novel.

In this novel first published in 1990, Mr Coetzee gives the grim account of both a human being facing imminent death and a country - South Africa - still immersed in the tragedy of the apartheid regime. Mrs Curren, a professor of classics in Cape Town, has just received the fatal news from her doctor, Dr Syfert, that she suffers from an incurable form of cancer. Part of the narrative consists in an imaginary letter Mrs Curren will never write to her daughter who left for America in 1976. Indeed she does not consider it to be just to share her burden with her daughter but, as she puts it, "to resist the craving to share my death", "to take my leave without bitterness" and "to embrace death as my own, mine alone." But since it is nearly impossible for her to approach death without the support of another human being, she ends up sharing her thoughts and life with Mr Vercueil, a tramp she finds one morning sleeping in the garden of her house.Death is omnipresent in Mr Coetzee's work, not only Mrs Curren's but in the townships of Cape Town where the lives of the coloureds are worth next to nothing and therefore death is as common as life for the people obliged to live there. A powerful, sad and unforgettable tale whose characters and events cut to the bone.

Meanwhile, two women unknown to each other are drawn inexorably to Belinda and into Matt's life - and into deadly danger.

A pleasant fictionalised biography of the novelist Henry James in which the author concentrates not so much on dates and events but on James's relationship with his family and friends. Actually Colm Toibin deliberately chose to write about a specific period of James's life, namely from January 1895 to October 1899 with a few flashbacks to tell about his youth in America before he settled in England.We learn about the failure of his theatre play Guy Domville while Oscar Wilde was enjoying a raging success with an Ideal Husband, his subsequent departure to Ireland, the death of his wife Alice. Then he followed Wilde's imprisonment and the exile of his wife and children which impressed James very much. Often Colm Toibin describes how ideas for a new novel or short story matured in James's mind and how they were related to his daily encounters and impressions. James could write and read at leisure after the purchase of Lamb House in Rye where he enjoyed his solitude between the visits of his friends, his brother William, his sister in law Alice and Peggy, his niece. But it was after meeting the young and impetuous sculptor Hendrik Andersen in Rome that James realised that he himself was ageing slowly because he saw that Andersen was too young to know how memory and regret mingle, how nothing seems to have any shape or meaning until it is well past and lost.

The novel tells in dramatic detail how Nick and Alix Fraser casually break the heart of Frances Hinton, a well-behaved and observant young woman who works in the reference library of a medical research laboratory dedicated to the study of problems of human behaviour and who longs, in her subdued way, for love. She is an orderly young woman and Spartan in her habits. If she suffers loneliness it is because she has settled for the harsh habit of dealing with all matters by herself.And soon Frances is disappointed in love. "I knew about love and its traps ... I never speak of it" and turns to writing as a form of therapy and escape, as a way to reorder her world. She writes when she feels swamped in her solitude and hidden by it, physically obscured by it and rendered invisible. Writing is her way of piping up, of reminding people that she is here. We may well guess how much of her own personality the author put in her heroine's character.An altogether convincing portrait of failed love and solitude, reminiscent of so many of Anita Brookner's protagonists.

"Victoria" is the tormented story of Johannes Moller, the miller's son, and Victoria, a Chamberlain's daughter living at an unnamed Castle. Although they have known each other since their childhood, their love is bound to fail, mainly for social reasons. Victoria's family want her to marry Lieutenant Otto because they need the son-in-law's money to restore their former glory, a marriage of convenience in other words.Johannes is deeply in love with Victoria, musing about the fragrance emanating from her body, the shape of her shoulders and body. He is driven to despair by Victoria, her shifting mood, saying she loves him but very often refusing to meet him, avoiding him. Johannes has moments of hallucinatory nightmares, seeing strange figures, human heads rolling on the pavement in front of him, voices shouting at him. He is seized by icy fears and sees barking fish...Johannes also feels that he doesn't fit in Victoria's world and the society of the castle remains distant to him. "My dear young lady, the place is yours, not mine" he tells her. When Johannes meets Lieutenant Otto, Victoria's fiance, a feeling of utter despair descends on him because the reason for Victoria's attachment to Otto is solely due to the fact that he is "well-bred".A novel of unhappiness, missed opportunities and loneliness occasioned by greed, social pressure and indecisiveness.

Mr Golding's first novel chronicles the life of Santiago Moore Zamora. He was born in Spain where he lived until he was sent to boarding school in England. Certain passages in this novel are of real interest: Santiago's affection for his nurse Mam?zelle, his solitude in the company of others, his disgust for physical activity, his perception of the futility of social behaviour and his attachment to his teachers which leads to the loss of his virginity. The reader may freely skip parts one and five of Mr Golding's novel, unless he needs to learn that some homosexuals are obsessively preoccupied with their own body and clothing and that because one of their major concerns in life is sex, their bound to be unhappy, their life being an abomination indeed.

In her first novel published in 1981, the author portrays Dr Ruth Weiss who became an authority on women since the publication of her study "Women in Balzac's Novels". The opening sentence in the novel is as follows: "Dr Weiss, at forty, knew that her life had been ruined by literature".And so the author retraces Ruth's youth and her inability to engage in a durable relationship with a man. In this sense Ruth strongly feels that she resembles the main character in Balzac's "Eug&eacute;nie Grandet" because Eug&eacute;nie was always uncomfortable with hopeless love. Ruth often thinks of Eug&eacute;nie's reflection in the novel: "Je ne suis pas assez belle pour lui" and "Je suis trop laide, il ne fera pas attention &agrave; moi". Who is to blame for her loveless life? Her parents Helen and George who always required her attention? Her own indecisive character? The men she met in her life? When one reaches the end of the novel, one realises that Ruth's loveless life is due to a series of reasons which seem to engulf her despite her own will, or rather that her own will is too weak to offer any kind of resistance to the demands of life and of other people.A delicate and sophisticated first novel which marked the beginning of a great literary career.

Rachel Kennedy is a solitary and self-sufficient woman who likes to lead a well-ordered life free of commitments and emotional turmoil. She owns a small bookshop in London and one day befriends Heather Livingstone and her parents Oscar and Dorrie - a mutual fondness which is a puzzle given Rachel's character. It soon becomes clear to Heather that Oscar and Dorrie think her a suitable companion for Heather, a kind of elder sister or guardian angel. Their good daughter, who comes home to them every weekend and telephones every day, is the world to them and they wish her still theirs and somebody else's as well, somebody whose supervision could replace their own. To them, Rachel could be Heather's passport to the world. So Oscar and Dorrie regard Rachel as a chaperone for Heather. And to Rachel her odd relationship with the Livingstones is of great value too. For her they are fixed points of reference in a slipping universe, abiding by rules which everybody else has broken.It is when Heather decides to become engaged to Michael Sandberg, an awkward and untrustworthy man, that Rachel realises that her power over her friend is limited. The fate of this ill-assorted couple is bound to be doomed...Well drawn characters, plausible situations and sound psychological motives are the strengths of "A Friend From England". A quiet, atmospheric novel as only Mrs Brookner can write them.

&quot;Dusklands&quot; consists of two very different parts. In &quot;The Vietnam Project&quot;, Mr Coetzee tells the story of Eugene Dawn, a specialist in psychological warfare whose task it is to establish a document called the Vietnam Project dealing with the so-called Phase IV of the Vietnam conflict in the years 1973-1974. To give his imagination a helpful impulse, Dawn carries with him photographs that will illustrate the report. They show gruesome scenes of the war like for example sergeant Clifford Houston copulating with a Vietnamese woman or two other sergeants, Berry and Wilson, posing with several severed Vietnamese heads as trophies. But soon Dawn is driven to breakdown and madness by the stress of this macabre project to win the war in Vietnam. After having been driven to a nearly fatal assault on his child Martin, Dawn is placed in an institution. The text closes with Dawn reflecting as follows: &quot;I have high hopes of finding whose fault I am.&quot;&quot;The narrative of Jacobus Coetzee&quot; is actually a translation from Afrikaans by J.M. Coetzee of a text published in 1762. It is the account of a hideous vengeance of a frontiersman on a tribe of Hottentots in South Africa.Both Eugene Dawn in the 1970s and Jacobus Coetzee in the 1760s are dealers in death who claim their humanity and impressively express their feelings of guilt.

In 1944 Beppe Gallizio, aged 15, was stationed on the road from Alba to Acqui in the Piedmont with a simple-minded soldier called Angelin to watch for any passing fascisti. Just before dying in an ambush, Angelin dug up a truffle in a nearby field.After the war, Beppe returned to the place and his secret hoard of white truffles allowed him to make a good living until Aldo Vincenzo decided to put up a barbed wire around his property to protect his vineyard since his wine was slowly acquiring a reputation.Then the prices for la trifola went through the roof and the truffle became to be known as the "white diamond" so Beppe had to take extra precaution in order that his annual harvesting remained secret. But one night a man saw Beppe in the dark and his dog Anna barked at him...When Dottor Aurelio Zen is summoned to the Palazzo Torozzo, house of a famous director called "Giulio", Aldo Vincenzo is dead and his son Manlio is in prison, accused of having murdered his father. Since Giulio is an eager wine collector and this year's harvest at the Vincenzo estate is likely to be one of the greatest of the century, Giulio has arranged with the Ministry of the Interior for Zen to be sent to the gloomy city of Alba in order to release Manlio Vincenzo from prison in time to make the wine this year! And that is going to be far less easy than Zen had anticipated...Another sympathetic glance at Italy by Michael Dibdin, this time allowing the reader to cast a glance at the secrets of winemaking.

In 1968 Charles Sommerville, son of the impoverished landowner Philip Sommerville, is on the run from drug dealers in the Welsh Borders. At the same time in nearby Llantrisillio, James and Suzie, newcomers to that part of England, find their sylvan idyll brutally and shockingly shattered by the voyeurism of a farming neighbour... Also in Border country, in Birmingham, policeman John Munroe is liaising with his Welsh colleagues on a routine enquiry. But a mysterious death in the area draws him inexorably into an investigation which is to uncover a tangle of dangerous passions running beneath the outwardly calm rural scene. This book unfortunately features a poorly designed plot - to the point of becoming almost unbelievable - as well as an unskilful characterisation.

Readers aspiring to have a knowledge of Charlotte Bront's work should read "The Professor" as it contains the key to much of her subsequent writing like "Jane Eyre" or "Vilette". The novel is based on the author's own experiences in Brussels. The central character, William Crimsworth, an orphan, leaves his dreary clerking post in a Yorkshire mill to start a career as a teacher of English in the Belgian capital. He falls in love with a Protestant pupil, Frances Henri, teacher and lace mender. However William's relationship is complicated by the manipulative and beguiling Catholic headmistress, Zoraide Reuter, and her cunning attempts to divert him from his destiny.The novel, written in 1846, astonishes by its brevity and realism and by its portrayal of the heroine's insistence on a working career after her marriage.

Gao Xingjian uses small events occurring in daily life such as the visit of a decaying temple by a young couple, a road accident involving a father and a his young child, a swimmer suffering from a sudden pain or conversation in a park to deal with topics which he cherishes: the lost innocence of youth, the quest for an environment ruined by modern architecture or the nostalgia for a lost tenderness that only a father or grandfather could provide. Often there is no plot in those short stories, but a simple succession of images, impressions, dreams and thoughts. An author well worth discovering.

The author proposes to reflect on the subject of biographies. There are some interesting thoughts in this novel, particularly when the author dwells on what a good biography should be like. He discusses the question of the biographer's empathy with the subject or what subjects should be worthy of a biography, the question of its length and whether its role is to make the reader understand other people. Perhaps when reading a biography there is a desire to find out how one differs from personalities like W.H. Auden, Napoleon or Verdi. But is it worthwhile for the biographer to be tormented by the question of how many grains of salt his subject put on his eggs, as Ximenes Doudan was about Julius Caesar? Is the Picasso of the blue period really the same man as the one who painted Guernica at the end of his life? How can the biographer understand the subject's experiences of which he himself has no experience?Aside from such reflexions - even though treated quite superficially - the book contains lengthy observations of the banal habits of a young lady called Isabel Rogers who lives in London and whose biography will interest very few readers indeed.

In this moving tale, Paula Fox tells the story of Luisa Sanchez who was born on the Spanish-speaking Caribbean island of San Pedro in the 1930s. After spending her childhood there with the members of her family her father decides to move to New York where Luisa's fate is to become a maid like her mother.Readers won't let themselves in for 300 pages of misery because the novel is built on an astonishing sensitivity to the inner lives of its characters, a sensitivity which is conveyed clearly and honestly. Although Luisa struggles desperately to survive in spite of emotional, financial and racial adversity, it is a feeling of understanding she provokes more than that of pity.It is also of course a book about the trials of immigrant life and about the tensions within the family circle which cause us to make decisions the consequences of which one only fully understands later in life. So Luisa's father is responsible for the decision to leave Malagita and he's the only one who wants to be in New York. Her mother refuses to learn English and soon dies of cancer and Luisa defies her father's wishes to become educated and aligns herself with her mother and becomes a maid.So Luisa orchestrates her life by sticking to one persistent dream: returning to her beloved Malagita. She actually says that it is the very monotony of her servant's life that freed her to return in her thoughts to Malagita. Like so many exiles she is there but not there in the lives of wealthy New Yorkers, a group of hilarious and exotic characters marvellously drawn.Though Luisa's fate is tragic the author gives her so much dignity that it is not possible to see her as pathetic.

The deck of the "Ocean Mammoth" stretches nearly a fifth of a mile from bridge to bows; its superstructure rises above the water-line to a height of a ten storey building; loaded it displaces 320,000 tons; it is among the latest and finest of the monster tankers that swarm in ever increasing numbers across the oceans; yet in a time of falling freight rates and dwindling cargoes it has no useful part to play. It has to die. But the death of a supertanker is not easily contrived if it has to appear as an accident. The conspiracy to take "Ocean Mammoth" to her doom involves meticulous planning and ruthless execution.But even then the story is far from over, for who is responsible? The formidable and withdrawn Captain Crutchley, whose secret disability nags incessantly at his security? Freeman Jarrett, the flamboyantly handsome chief officer, driven by restless ambition and boundless conceit? Foley, the capable but colourless navigating officer, striving to hold a wife too attractive and extravagant for his peace of mind? Or is it someone else? Some other crewman who had access to the complex electronic systems upon which the supertanker's safety depends?These questions remain unanswered until the final stages of the Court of Enquiry, when the truth emerges in a moment of sudden drama...

Dr Storr's book about solitude is very edifying. It is interesting to learn how many people of genius were lonely-goers: their creative talent, their mental instability and their incapacity for making satisfying personal relationships are closely linked. Such famous people as Descartes, Newton, Locke, Pascal, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Nietsche, Kierkegaard, Kafka or Wittgenstein were all lonely people without necessarily being unhappy. These people were great thinkers and it is remarkable to see that thinking is essentially a solitary activity. The capacity to be alone is necessary for the brain to function at its best and it is also an aspect of emotional maturity. Learning, thinking, creating and maintaining contact with one's inner world are all facilitated by solitude. Great religious figures also have recognised that solitude promotes insight. Buddha, Jesus, St Matthew, St Luke and Mahomet all spent part of their existence in some sort of retreat. They all understood that solitude allows to escape from the pressure of ordinary life and is a way of spiritual renewal. It may well be that monastic seclusion and the absence of close personal ties in such institutions not only facilitate the individual's relation with God, but also fosters scholarship.Solitude is a sign of inner security rather than the expression of a withdrawn state. It also appears probable that those who prefer to be alone are more at ease with inanimate objects or with abstract concepts than they are with other people. This need to be alone is derived from or is enhanced by some degree of insecure attachment in early childhood. This was the case of people like Rudyard Kipling, H. H. Munro, P. G. Wodehouse or George Simenon. For them, the process of creation was a way of protecting themselves against being overwhelmed by depression. Their interests take over some of the functions more usually performed by intimate relationships. Because the higher reaches of abstraction require long periods of solitude and intense concentration which are hard to achieve if one has to meet the emotional demands of friends or a wife and children. And it is a consolation to learn that people living in a secluded manner do not suffer at all because interpersonal relationships are not the only way of finding emotional fulfilment.Dr Storr also devotes a fascinating chapter to enforced solitude and the harrowing effects that solitary confinement can have on the human mind. He quotes Francis Bacon: "The worst solitude is to be destitute fo sincere friendship".Dr Storr's study of solitude is a marvellous book, very readable even for the layman in psychology and very instructive too.

Blanche Vernon is a divorced middle-aged woman living an independent and dignified life alone in London. Her husband Bertie left her in the favour of Amanda - he refers to her as Mousie - a bubbling yuppie in her twenties.She finds solace in the paintings of the British Museum and in her voluntary work at a local hospital. That is where she meets Susan Beamish and her eight-year old girl Elinor. Although not deaf, Elinor is unable to speak due to some psychic trouble. Blanche soon starts to have some protective and motherly feelings for Elinor but later has to realise that her mother sees Blanche's attempts at love for Elinor as misappropriation and that she herself doesn't fully understand the laws of property.Although the notion of misalliance is an interesting one, it seems a rather thin one to be at the core of a two-hundred page novel. There are many passages revolving around Blanche's current state of mind, often concerning matters of little interest such as her health or her eating habits. Nevertheless the quality of the writing is excellent as usual in Anita Brookner's novels. It is perhaps the choice of the topic which is a little unfortunate.

Grace Quinn, of English origin, has been married for 30 years to Michael Quinn, a violent and alcoholic man and has lived for the same time as an outsider in Ireland, in a small place called Monaghan. Her first son Sean drowned in a ditch when he was 3 and her second son, Martin, left to live in Dublin. He was forced to lave Monaghan after having admitted to his father that he was homosexual, a fact his father couldn't admit since "the animals in the fields don't even do that". Finally Grace can't take the violence anymore and runs over Michael with her car one night as he is coming back home, drunk.After her crime, Grace joins her son Martin in Dublin but she soon understands that it is difficult for her to come to terms with her son's way of life and she can't help feeling out of place, bored and tired of staying in the house Martin shares with his boyfriend Henry. Furthermore there is neither escape nor redemption to be found in Dublin for the crime she committed.An altogether interesting first novel with an original plot structure although perhaps a bit lengthy at times. Certainly Grace's psychological instability in a life which became devoid of meaning after Michael's death and her son's difficulty in trying to comprehend her behaviour in Dublin are the strong points in Mr Ridgway's novel.

Mr McCann offers readers an astonishingly gripping biography of the Russian dancer Rudolph Nureyev written as a piece of fiction. It is not a biography in the classic sense of the term since real characters with true identities mingle with fictitious characters in episodes from the author's imagination. Nureyev's moody personality combined with his professionalism as a dancer are wonderfully captured by the author. By employing the technique of multiple narrators and skilfully interchanging between them - they are set in various locations in Russia, New York, France and England - Mr McCann has managed to produce the portrait of a vivid and many faceted artist with a tremendous charisma. Where most biographies tend to isolate and estrange its subject by pointing out its uniqueness, the author has achieved quite the opposite effect. Indeed, it often feels as if the reader were himself part of the dancer's exhilarating and thwarting lifestyle. It is the author's genius to transform carefully researched material into sparkling fiction on an artist whose fame, artistic accomplishment and shrewish, hedonistic, homosexual night life of 1970s New York are legendary.

Kitty Maule, a professor of literature, falls in love with Maurice Bishop, professor of medieval history. Kitty loved him for two years and entertained high hopes but their brief affair settles down into a sort of comradely routine which puzzles her but which she accepts. She soon realises that she is not indispensable for him. Like the main character in Benjamin Constant's novel "Adolphe" which she teaches in one of her classes, Kitty becomes aware of the fact that a man gets tired of a woman if she sacrifices everything for him.Anita Brookner uses Benjamin Constant's "Adolphe" as a counterpoint to Kitty's restrained but passionate affair with Maurice, who does not return her love. Kitty eventually loses Maurice to one of her students, a pretty and vapid young woman, and resigns herself to disappointment in life and love. And this is typical Anita Brookner: a woman's placid existence is interrupted by people and events outside her control, pushed to a certain point of emotional crisis, before resuming its progress towards isolation, or perhaps greater realism.

This is the author's highly acclaimed debut novel. Two men, an architect, Guy Haines, and a psychopath, Charles Bruno, meet on a train to swap murders. Charles will kill Guy's wife Miriam and Guy will kill Charles's father. A chance meeting and a rash conversation will trap Guy Haines, almost against his will, in a nightmare. This is a cunningly plotted melodrama and I read it with thorough enjoyment. Alfred Hitchcock shot a film baring the same name and the movie is equally thrilling. Classic suspense is still the best in my view!In this audiobook, Mr William Roberts reads Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; with plenty of enthusiasm and I enjoyed his voice very much. He manages to adapt his intonation beautifully according to the situation, at times tense, then hilarious, then serious again. A great performance.

In her novel, Mrs Lessing depicts the epic adventure of Mara and her brother Dann who live in the distant future on the African continent, then called Ifrik. Its centre is plagued by an incessant drought whereas its northern part is permanently covered by a coat of ice. Mara and Dann are respectively seven and four when they become orphans. They are brought to a place called The Rock Village and it is Daima who takes care of them. A few years later they begin their epic journey from the centre of Ifrik to its northern part where there is more water and consequently more food. During their trip they come across all kinds of primitive peoples living in very poor conditions and in many instances Dann and Mara have to fight in order to survive.It is an apocalyptic world which Mrs Lessing imagined for her novel. One in which people live in tribe-like colonies and behave in a very aggressive manner toward each other. It is a world in which all scientific knowledge has been lost and in which there is no more room for culture or art. There are cities which were once splendid and now have either turned into ruins or have been submerged by floods. Nature has become so hostile that it is barely possible for people to inhabit the centre of Ifrik. There are giant spiders, water dragons, enormous lizards and huge beetles who can bisect a child with their pincers. A frightening vision of the future of our planet indeed.Readers will no doubt be comforted by the fact that there are still authors today who manage to write a powerful adventure story without resorting to the tedious ingredients of guns, cars, explosions, terrorists, FBI/CIA & Co. and billions of dollars.

The author tells the story of an unnamed country completely destroyed by fire and abandoned by its people in which two nameless characters, a boy and his father, undertake a long and painful journey to the southern parts of that country where they hope to find a milder climate. Their only possessions are their clothes, a cart and a pistol to defend themselves against all manners of bandits who stalk the roads. They survive on scarce canned food which they manage to find in long abandoned houses and their constant fight against the excruciating cold is a daily battle for survival. At times their progress along the road seems pointless because there appears to be no hope anywhere. People are hostile and aggressive and the boy and the father owe their survival largely to their love for each other in the face of complete devastation and desolation.A poignant novel, gripping to the very last word, in which we see mankind at its worst and at its best.

Matteo and Caroline were both brought up in Italy. Caroline was sent to a convent school in Milan and Matteo to a school in Turin which had been recommended by his uncle. However Matteo performed very poorly: he was bad at maths, could not sing and played football in a disastrous way so that he was constantly bullied by his classmates. Finally his parents decided to take him back home and they found a tutor, Fabian, for his education. But he remained a rebellious student, learning nothing, eating nothing. Whenever his father talked to him about a career in banking or in the family silk business, Matteo would simply smile faintly. Finally in the summer of 1975, he married Sophie, the daughter of a German banker and together they left for India taking with them Matteo's much beloved copy of Hermann Hesse's "The Journey to the East".In Bombay they met Pierre Eduard who took them to an elderly woman who performed a few tricks as a form of worship to the glory of Shiva. Whilst Sophie remained unimpressed with what she called "party tricks", Matteo on the other hand was quite transfixed by what he had seen. Later they met Mr Pandey, a "deus ex machina" as Sophie called him in her exasperation, who suggested that they go and live in an ashram. After that Matteo came up with the idea that they replicate the journey which a famous saint had undertaken on foot to a shrine where he obtained enlightenment. But Sophie could not share Matteo's enthusiasm about searching for "the mystery that is the heart of India" during the exhausting expedition and even after such a short time spent in the country, she had no doubt that it was a culture to which she would never belong. Matteo on the other hand was literally seized by madness with his quest for the "devine light" despite the warnings that "the gods are destructive in this country". Will Matteo's studying with a swami at a distant ashram help him recover his senses? Will Matteo and Sophie go through this adventure together and recover their love?Mrs Desai shows hard and driven people in her novel, the mutual contempt of a wife and a husband, the rejection foreigners may experience in India and also a man deluding himself in an impossible quest. Perhaps the author's other novels like "Baumgartner's Bombay" or "In Custody" are more accessible, less obscure.

Alfred Jones works as a translator and letter-writer in a chocolate factory in Vevey. He gets acquainted with Anna-Luise, daughter of Dr Fischer of Geneva. The latter became a millionaire by selling toothpaste and lives in a mansion in Versoix.A strange marriage it is because Jones is in his fifties and Anna-Luise could almost be his daughter - she is 21. But this is perhaps what she seeks, a father more sympathetic than Dr Fischer whom Jones detests because of his pride, his contempt of all the world and his cruelty. He doesn't even oppose to his marrying Anna-Luise.Dr Fischer is famous for the parties he gives at his house. The parties are always attended by the same people: General Kruger (a divisionnaire in the Swiss army), Richard Deane (a film star), Mr Kips (the bent lawyer) and Mrs Montgomery who acts as a hostess. Though wealthy, all these characters are in one way or other dependant on Dr Fischer which allows him to humiliate, despise and belittle them during those parties. Only Jones doesn't allow himself to be mocked which greatly displeases Dr Fischer.With his last party - The Bomb Party - Graham Greene shows the limitless greed of the rich and the party becomes a farce, a black comedy and a painful satire, and it allows the author to show that cynicism is actually only a faade behind which weak characters like to hide.

In "Wide Sargasso Sea", Jean Rhys offers the reader another side to "Jane Eyre". The story of Bertha, the first Mrs Rochester, "Wide Sargasso Sea" is a damning history of colonialism in the Caribbean.The story is set just after the emancipation of the slaves, in that difficult time when racial relations in the Caribbean were at their most tense. Antoinette is descended from plantation owners. She can be accepted neither by the black community nor by the representatives of the colonial centre. As a white Creole she is nothing. The taint of racial impurity, coupled with the suspicion that she is mentally imbalanced bring about her downfall.Rhys divides the speaking voice between Rochester, who is never named in the novel and Antoinette. Rochester is portrayed a proud younger brother betrayed by his family into a loveless marriage. His double standards are exposed when he chooses to sleep with the maid, Am&eacute;lie, so displaying the promiscuous behaviour and attraction to the black community which he accuses Antoinette of harbouring. Their happiness at Granbois is ended by his willingness to believe the worst of Antoinette.The lack of understanding between two cultures is at the root of Antoinette's subsequent madness. Madness for Antoinette mostly derives from the uneasy feeling of being unable to tell the difference between dream and reality, when reality eventually becomes dream-like.The book is read by Anna Bentinck for ISIS Publishing. An impressive performance given the wide range of accents used by the reader.

Brother Sebastian, alias Michael Lamb, works at a finishing school for the sons of the Idle Poor in Ireland. There the Brothers teach boys to conform, make their beds, how to hold a knife and fork in order to shoehorn them back into society at an age when, if they commit another offence, they go to the grown-up prison. If they do not conform, the school thrashes them. The Brothers thus teach them a little of God and a lot of fear.It is to comply with his father's wish that Michael has stayed so long in the Brothers and besides he always wanted to help in whatever way he could the suffering of the world. Like the Lamb of God, he wanted to take away the sins of the world.There are three reasons which push Michael to leave the Brothers: the death of his father and the money he left him, the values for which the school stands which he can no longer tolerate and his attachment to a boy called Owen Kane (Owen is the Gaelic word for lamb) whom he doesn't see fit for such an institution.He therefore decides to leave secretly the school and take Owen with him to London with the hope to be the boy's saviour. They pose as father and son but soon the world closes in around them and when time, money and opportunity run out, Michael has no other option than to move towards a solution that is as uncompromising as it is inspired by his love for Owen.A powerful and deeply humane novel with a breathtaking ending, both dramatic and inevitable.

Mrs Melville's original tale tells the story of the McKinnons who lived in the Rupununi district of the Guianas at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a fairly complex tale involving many protagonists and what is interesting is that the plot revolves around the Amerindian mythology of the brother-sister incest, in this case involving two characters called Beatrice and Danny McKinnon.The myth concerns the eclipse which represents brother-and-sister incest in the form of a copulating sun and moon and it is widespread throughout the Americas, from the Bering Straight in the North to the southern parts of Brazil. People believe that a brother came secretly to his sister at nights. She enjoyed this but, not knowing who he was, painted his face in black with some genipap plant to identify him. In his shame, the brother rose to the sky and became the moon which explains why the moon has dark patches on its face. Other events are interesting in the novel: Father Napier's pathetic attempt at converting the Rupununi district to Christianity and his subsequent failure and descent into madness, the existence of Beatrice's son Sonny and his tragic disappearance and also Beatrice's threat uttered to her sister Wifreda during an eclipse to make her blind. An impressive first novel well worth reading.

Considering the significance of architecture, the author remarks that beautiful houses falter as guarantors of happiness and can also be accused of failing to improve the characters of those who live in them and proceeds by explaining why this is so. Karl Friedrich Schinkel for example stated that to turn something useful, practical, and functional into something beautiful is the architect's duty. Architecture should thus be the decoration of construction as distinguished from mere building. The architects of the Modernist movement, like all their predecessors, wanted their houses to speak and express emotions. Indeed buildings speak. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past.Interestingly enough what we search for in a work of architecture is not so far from what we search for in a friend because the objects we describe as beautiful art versions of the people we love. The buildings we admire are those which extol values we think are worthwhile: through their materials, shapes and colours they express qualities such as friendliness, kindness, subtlety, strength and intelligence. As Stendhal wrote, "Beauty is the promise of happiness."We are vulnerable to what the spaces we inhabit are saying. In a drab hotel room our optimism and sense of purpose are liable to drain away. We look to our buildings to hold us, like a kind of psychological mould, to a helpful vision of ourselves. We need a home in the psychological sense as much as we need a home in the physical sense: to compensate for vulnerability, we need a refuge.We may feel joy at the architectural perfection we see before us and at the same time melancholy at an awareness of how seldom we are sufficiently blessed to encounter anything of its kind. And sadness is conducive to receptivity: our downhearted moments provide architecture and art with their best openings because it is at such times that our hunger for their ideal qualities is at its height.Such thoughts and many other are contained in this study of architecture and make for a valuable and interesting read.

Harriet and David met at an office end-of-the-year party. David Lovatt was a successful architect and they decided to marry the following spring. Soon they found a large Victorian house within commuting distance of London.Their first son Luke was born in 1966. Then followed Helen, Jane and Paul in 1973.Then Harriet was pregnant for the fifth time. But it was a difficult pregnancy, the foetus kicking and punching, but eventually their fifth child, Ben, was born. At four months, he already looked like an "angry, hostile little troll".Later on, he became so aggressive and repulsive that Harriet and David had to protect themselves and other members of their family from his kicks and bites. Finally David decided to take him to an "institution". But soon Harriet could not tolerate the situation and on her own accord drove to the North of England to bring Ben back home. What she found there constitutes the most harrowing scene of the novel and is no doubt Mrs Lessing's sharp critique of the way such institutions used to treat mentally retarded children. Then follows Harriet's desperate attempts to re-educate Ben for social life, to the disgust of the other members of the family.A moving and very disturbing novel in which Mrs Lessing brilliantly shows that a mother can love and devote herself to a child even if it is no more than a monster or an alien.

Mr Brink tells the haunting story of Hanna X which takes place at the beginning of the 20th century in the German colony of what was then called Deutsch-S&uuml;dwestafrika (German South-West Africa), now Namibia. It was then the custom that the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft sent hundreds of women and girls to Africa "to assuage the need of men desperate for matrimony, procreation or an uncomplicated" love-making.Hanna X, resident of a forlorn place called Frauenstein in the middle of nowhere in the desert, contemplates her face in the mirror. Tufts of blond hair hacked off with a kitchen knife, part of her right ear is missing leaving a dark hole, she has only part of the left eyebrow left, her face is criss-crossed with scars and most frightening of all, she has no tongue, only a small black stub, far back. The sound she utters is Ahhhhh... How did Hanna X undergo such hideous mutilations and who inflicted them to her?And so the narrator traces back the harrowing tale of this poor orphan back to her childhood in Bremen. She grew up in an institution called the Little Children of Jesus where her books were confiscated by Frau Agathe, where she was "touched" by Pastor Ulrich and beaten regularly. Hanna found refuge with her teacher, Fr&auml;ulein Braunschweig, who let her read stories like "Die Leiden des Jungen Werther" or that of Jeanne D'Arc.Her years in service were also marked by desolation. With the Klatts for instance. Frau Hildegard was a mean-spirited woman and Herr Dieter had to be "serviced" for a few Pfennig. So Hanna decided to apply with the Kolonialgesellschaft and was granted passage to Africa by Frau Sprandel who dismissed her with the premonitory warning not to "expect too much of her palm trees". It is on board the Hans Woermann that Hanna experienced love and tenderness for the first and only time in her life with a girl called Lotte. It was after their arrival in Africa, during the train journey which was to take them to Windhoek, that Hanna was confronted with Hauptmann Heinrich B&ouml;hlke and the outcome of this encounter was what Hanna now sees in the mirror in Frauenstein: a monstrously disfigured creature...Such humiliation and dismemberment was inflicted to her not because of anything she had done but simply because she was a woman. From then on, it is hatred that drives everything she does "as inexorable as the desert sun". This hatred is a form of liberation for Hanna as she begins her long journey with Katja towards the confrontation with the man or men who turned her into something "like out of hell". As the two women set off in the desert towards Windhoek, it is to keep an appointment with destiny..."The Other Side of Silence" is probably the best novel ever written about the horrors of colonialism in Africa. Some passages in the book remind the reader of what happened during the Holocaust. Mr Brink has rightly been compared to the greatest writers of our times like Solzhenitsyn, Garcia Marques or Peter Carey.

Furthermore, one of his students nearly offends Adam when he states that he now looks anything like his picture on the back of his books. All this happens as Adam meets one of his admirers, Ralph, at a party.

He assures him that the operation has already been performed successfully hundreds of times, as was the case on himself.

Mr McCann portrays a young man, Conor Lyons, visiting his ageing father Michael during six days in Mayo, Ireland. During these six days - they seem like the days of the Creation indeed - Conor retraces his father's epic life from his early childhood after the first World War when he was just a bundle of abandoned skin and rescued by two Protestant ladies who raised him. Later, when the ladies died, Michael sold their property and developed a strong passion for photography. He sold his prints to various newspapers. In 1939 he went to Madrid and subsequently to Mexico where he married Juanita. Obsessed with the beauty of her body, Michael took hundreds of pictures of her in various stages of nudity. These photos became a strong point of discord between them in later years and they're the probable cause for Juanita's vanishing 11 years before Conor's account. After that they moved to California, Wyoming and New York before finally returning back to Ireland.It is the impressive tale of a son retracing his parents' long journey in order to try to find his mother again. It is also the story of a son witnessing the physical decay of his old father rotting in his own dirt and whose sole preoccupation in old age is fishing. A formidable novel by the best contemporary Irish novelist.

Mr Rao tells the story of Yudi, a forty year old freelance journalist living in Bombay and his twenty year old boyfriend Milind. The novel offers nothing more original than the old tale of a middle-aged man falling in love with a boy half his age. Other authors have dealt with this topic in a more refined manner: Stefan Zweig in "Confusion" or Thomas Mann in "Death In Venice".What may make this novel worth reading are the sights and sounds of India which are described in a humorous way by the author.

Everyman, the son of a Jewish jeweller in New York, had an irresistible urge to paint when he was young and so made a considerable success as an art director and later as the creative director of an advertising agency. Now that his health is ailing and because he is a vulnerable, assailable and confused man, he is haunted by the thoughts of dying. He suffers from the occlusion of his major coronary arteries, he has to undergo surgery and he is no longer able to lead a self-sustained life and has to move to the Starfish Beach retirement village at the Jersey Shore. Now eluding death has become the central business of his life and bodily decay his major preoccupation. He soon notices that his regular hospitalisations have made him lonelier and a less confident man that he was at the beginning of his retirement. He feels displaced at the Starfish Beach home just when age demands that he be rooted somewhere.If this novel reflects Mr Roth's own preoccupations, then they are very bleak indeed. There is not much optimism in Everyman's reflections but then this is perhaps how some people feel when they have the tendency to be hypochondriacs and their relatives don't show much interest in them anymore...

In Respected Sir we get to know the son of a cart driver in Cairo, Othman Bayyumi. He starts working as a clerk at the eighth grade in the government and ends up at the splendid position of His Excellency the Director General. Though Othman shows great will and great ambition and thus has a successful career he remains a lonely man till the end of his life. Mr Mahfouz shows that a certain cold-heartedness is necessary for a man to be respected for his piety, diligence and rectitude and the price to pay for such a way is solitude.Wedding Song is the sad tale of Abbas Karam Younis, actor and later playwright, who within a few months disowns his disgraced parents, marries Tahia and has a son called Taher. Then Abbas decides to write his play called Afrah al-Qubbah using his imagination to create a protagonist through which he can confess and do penance. He thus uses art as a means of battle and rebellion against people born and bread in sin.

In his original first novel, Mr Stace tells the tale of Lord Rose Loveall of Playfield House, affectionately known as Love Hall, which is set in 19th century England. It is the story of an abandoned male child who was thrown on a dust heap in the wastelands of London one night. He was found by Lord Loveall, a man on the verge of mental sanity, who gave him the name of Rose and dressed him in girls' clothes to satisfy a deluded impulse of his own after the death of his sister Dolores and made him/her heir to his fortune. Rose was kept in complete ignorance of her true being with the connivance of her adopted mother.This rather long novel features a flurry of characters, families, plots and subplots and readers will find quite a challenge to keep track of the relationships between the protagonists. Fortunately a family tree is provided in the novel, which is quite a welcome help. Nevertheless, it is astonishing what captivating an effect a so-called Victorian novel can have on the reader in the 21st century. Mr Wesley's novel is very well documented and every detail of the complex story-line falls elegantly into place at the end of the narrative.For readers wishing to visit Playfield House, the author even provides a detailed description of the house and the grounds, including opening hours! One can hardly more thorough!

Dr Storr deals with various deviations related to sexuality. Although these vary from country to country and from epoch to epoch, various patterns of sexual behaviour can be considered as generic Although certain behaviours can be considered as unnatural, they are widely spread among both women and men in the Western civilisation. Dr Storr is chiefly concerned with the description of the origins of most deviations.The feeling of guilt is an essential factor in the production of sexual deviation because our societies place some restraints upon sexual conduct. With certain children, the feeling of guilt is so strong that they're unable to overcome it and continue to carry it with them into adult life with the result that their capacity for forming adult relationships is impaired. Extreme sexual guilt prevents a person from falling in love, since he or she cannot believe that another will find acceptable what he or she has himself or herself tried to reject.A conviction of sexual inferiority is an equally strong impediment. This is particularly the case with men since first they have to achieve and sustain erection, second the male has to become quite a different creature from his mother in the process of development from child to adult and third there is no male equivalent to child bearing. Furthermore, a boy whose father is either absent or indifferent has less chance of developing into a sexually confident adult male because the parent of the same sex fails the child by being a deficient sexual model. So the inferiority feeling so characteristic of the sexually deviant usually originates in an early failure in identification.Dr Storr examines different types of deviation like sado-masochism (relationships which try to re-create childish patterns in which one partner is acting the child and the other is assuming the role of parent), fetishism (in this case the fetish acts as a reassurance, a defence against fear, a magical device which ensures potency), transvestism (the transvestite may be said to have sexual relations with clothes instead of with a person), male and female homosexuality, exhibitionism, frotteurism, voyeurism, paedophilia and buggery.In the last part of his book, Dr Storr examines the methods of treatment of sexual deviants, notably by analytical psychotherapy.An instructive study allowing the reader to realise that a sexual deviation is the outward sign of a failure to make an adult love-relationship, the study of sexual deviation being nothing else than the study of sex without love. The only drawback of the study is that it dates back to 1964 and some aspects of it appear slightly obsolete today.

Kristjan Benediktsson left Iceland and came to America during the Great War. In 1921, after living some time in New York and working as a waiter at the Waldorf-Astoria, he met the enormously wealthy press magnate William Randolph Hearst who offered him the position of butler at his extravagant castle in San Simeon, California. Although Heart is still married to his wife who lives on the East Coast with their five sons, he shares his life with Miss Davies, an ageing, depressed and alcoholic movie star.As Kristjan undertakes to write numerous and never to be sent letters to his wife Elisabet in Iceland, the reader slowly discovers the man's tragic destiny. The contents of the letters partly explain the circumstances which lead Kristjan to marry Elisabet, to save her father's business and then to abandon both his shipping company and his family to flee to New York. What were his reasons? What did he seek in America and did he find what he was looking for? Why could Elisabet never find Kristjan despite her pathetic journey to New York with two of their four children?Mr Olafsson masterfully depicts a desperate character who can never face the members of his family again because of the choices he made earlier in his life. It is interesting to compare "Walking Into The Night" with Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains Of The Day" because, although both novels convey a different atmosphere, they both show that certain vital decisions we take in our lives are irrevocable.

The author's study on the art of traveling is divided into 5 parts: departure, motives, landscape, art and return. He starts by explaining that if our life is dominated by a search for happiness our travels reveal much about the dynamics of this quest. Taking J.K. Huysmans's hero in the novel A rebours, Des Esseintes, the author shows that some people are not fit for travels because their expectations are too high and their disappointments too great. Indeed valuable elements may be easier to experience in art and in anticipation than in reality since the imagination can provide a substitute for the common experience of travel.Then the author moves to the longing to be elsewhere taking the example of Charles Baudelaire who despised living in France and often expressed the whish to go anywhere but to stay at home. With Edward Hopper we understand why traveling is often linked with a sense of melancholy as his paintings show. With Gustave Flaubert's travels we discover that the search for the exotic abroad may be what we hunger for in vain at home. With Alexander von Humboldt we realise what it actually meant to travel to South America in the 1800s and that the geographical and meteorological discoveries he made there were quite a sensation when he reported them upon his return to Europe. With William Wordsworth we understand how Nature, in the Lake District for example, which the author took to comprise birds, streams and plants, can be a corrective to the psychological damage inflicted by life in the city. Then Mr de Botton studies the profound impact the landscapes of Provence had on the painter Vincent Van Gogh. Painters and artists are involved in an explicit process, namely to choose what aspects of reality to include and what to leave out. In that sense they have to be keen observers, a fact pointed out by the painter John Ruskin.With the help of a selection of writers, artists and thinkers, de Botton provides a valuable insight into everything from holiday romance to minibars, from airports to sightseeing.

In "Snow" the poet Ka returns to Turkey after more than a decade in Frankfurt, and journeys to Kars, far in the east. Among the things he hopes to find there is an old classmate and love, Ipek, now separated from her husband. He also plans to explore and report on a wave of suicides by girls there. It is snowing when Ka arrives, and the snow continues to fall, cutting off the town from the rest of the world. There is tension there: an upcoming mayoral election, the struggle between religion and secularism, a heavy-handed police presence. The conflict between Islam - and, for example, the right of girls to go to school wearing head-scarves - and the secular society the government has imposed causes the most problems.Ka is an outsider. He begins as a dutiful journalist, talking to a variety of town figures, trying to learn more about the suicides, but finds himself drawn into this larger conflict. Throughout the country, and especially in this region, it is no longer the Kurds that are perceived by the authorities as being the greatest threat, but the increasingly influential Islamists. Ka, respected as a poet but tainted as one who has presumably been polluted by Western thought and ways, is viewed with both suspicion and interest by both sides. The police are reluctant to rough him up - as they do the locals - because of his Istanbul and German connexions, while the Islamists see him as the enemy but warily accept that he might be able to help convey their message. Eventually, he is also used as a go-between by both sides.It is the desire to write a book about the poems written by Ka that leads the narrator - an alter-ego Orhan Pamuk, and long-time friend of Ka's - to tell this story.Snow is a book about the difficulties faced by a nation torn between tradition, religion, and modernization. Set in the farthest east of Turkey, the locals are certain that in Western eyes they're all considered as ignoramuses. Pamuk effectively portrays these difficulties, and the many ambiguities in contemporary Turkish life.The novel is expertly read by John Lee for Random House Audio.

&quot;The Emigrants&quot; first appear to be mere accounts of four different Jewish emigrants in the twentieth century. But gradually the four narratives merge into a poetic evocation of exile and loss. Mr Sebald's precise, almost dreamlike writing - along with many beautiful photographs - works its magic. The account of the displacement of these four emigres is both sober and delicate. Few books convey more about that complex and tragic fate. Michael Hulse's exquisite translation really makes this book a work of art.

The story is told by Kathy H., now thirty-one, who introduces herself as a "carer". The novel is divided into three parts: she tells first of her schooldays at Hailsham then her first year or so away from the school, and then finally recounts more recent events.The narrative begins much like many memories of childhood and school, though Kathy and her friends Tommy and Ruth aren't like other children, and Hailsham isn't a standard educational institution. From the beginning there's mention of "carers" and "donors" and the children have no family. Soon it becomes clear that Ishiguro portrays an alternate universe in which biological technology has advanced more rapidly than in our world. In this alternate version of the 1990's England, society raises human clones to maturity in order to kill them and harvest their organs. Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are all young clones awaiting their destiny.The author has instead chosen to look at the issue of genetic engineering through the eyes of characters who seldom consider the debate. The sensitivity and imagination he displays is such that the subject is treated in a distant, almost cool light. By choosing to enter the debate with a dramatic, heartrending account, Ishiguro enhances the emotional impact of his novel. The characters themselves offer no comment upon their lives, leaving the reader to form their own attachments and deliver their consequent judgment upon the issue.Ishiguro's understated narration focuses on the way young people make a life out of whatever is on offer. Hailsham students are carefully sheltered from any real understanding of their fate and of the world in which it will be acted out, have nothing else to go on.The depth and quality of the relationships between Kath, Tommy and Ruth certainly accentuate the cruelty of their deaths. From under the shadow of their fate, Ishiguro writes warmly of love and friendship and establishes an engrossing narrative pace.

Don Quixote de la Mancha, the renowned, the valiant, the sage, the enamoured knight, the undoer of wrongs, the tutor of wards and orphans, the protector of widows, the destroyer of maids, he who owns no other mistress than the peerless Dulcinea del Taboso.Cervantes is quite ironical with the picture of the knight embodied by the ridiculous but none the less moving character of Don Quixote. In a historical perspective one has to consider that the last book of chivalry was published in Spain in 1602 and Don Quixote was completed in 1615. The reading public at that time was thus quite ready to laugh at the fictional world of knights, castles, giants and dwarfs, enchantment and trials by ordeal. The publication of Don Quixote coincided with the realisation that the medieval military caste had little further use in a changing world. Therefore a knight-errant who, contrary to his literary heroes, is aged fifty, skinny and a poor rural gentleman. Sancho Panza is a fat, illiterate, lying and married squire lacking the gentility and education associated with chivalrous apprenticeship. It is interesting to note that Don Quixote did not die with the literary genre it parodies but has become a classic text of western cultural tradition.

In his novel, Mr Dangor depicts the Ali family Silas, Lydia and Michael who live in post apartheid Berea, Johannesburg. As the family ties fall apart, Michael has to come to terms with his grandfather's Ali Ali Indian origins and the fact that he is the son of a former security policeman, Francois Du Boise, who raped his mother.Mr Dangor tells a powerful story of how the horrors of apartheid seep into the life of a small coloured family, a haunting story of a family disintegrating. It is also the story of a country confronting its own past, creating dissonance and unease as the characters attempt to escape from history's tyranny and although the tone of the novel is bitter indeed, the author gives a satirical portrait of his country.

This short novella opens with the following facts: Carl leaves his office shortly before midnight to catch the last tube home. Inside the carriage, Carl spots a young woman reading a novel when four young men encircle her and try to grab her handbag. When Carl tries to protect her, the four men attack him and kick him into unconsciousness.The three first pages of the book consist of the account of Carl's accident. The rest of the story is seen from Carl's point of view, suffering from a psychological fall-out and amnesia as he is being treated in the coma ward of a hospital. His view of events is disorientated, his notion of time is blurred and his memory is unreliable.It is quite an interesting challenge that Alex Garland took to try to portray what happens in the mind of a comatose man. The effect is quite stunning, disturbing and even frightening at times. This edition is highly recommended since it features forty illustrations made from woodcuts created by the political cartoonist Nicholas Garland, the author's father.

The various authors in this collective study of shyness and embarrassment remarkably show the difference between these two concepts. It is interesting to see that a degree of inhibition in social behaviour due to the lack of social skills lead to reticence, narcissism, self-absorption, shame, humiliation and fear of negative evaluation and dejection.Not self-assured and not self-confident personalities often betray their public self-awareness with physiological symptoms like blushing, smiling and laughing excessively, perspiration and gaze avoidance.The principal causes for psychological anxiety are a low self-esteem, depression, loneliness, test anxiety, fearfulness, ambarrassability and audience anxiety. Shy personalities often suffer from clinical social phobia and show schizoid and avoidant personality disorders. Shyness can be attributed to a number of causes and can cause various patterns of behaviour: expectancy of inadequate social behaviour and negative evaluation (including negative self-evaluation), a high meta-cognitive level of psychological functioning, anxious self-preoccupation, avoid disclosing information about oneself, conformity to majority, passive and cautious comportment, excessive introspection and self-consciousness and social phobia - avoidant personality, hyperalertness, constant scanning of others.Some experiences can depreciate the individual's sense of self-esteem through either explicit or implicit rejection, humiliation or denigration. The transgression and violation of personal standards can lead to guilt and disappointment and one of the causes of shame and embarrassment is the violation of social norms and the transgression of normative expectations. Two modes of behaviour can be observed in a social context: defensive impression management which is reflective of a desire to protect one's social image and an assertive impression management the purpose of which is to improve one's social image.Social anxiety arises in situations in which one's self-presentation may be subject to attack or humiliation. Since socially anxious people have unrealistically high self-standards, they are inordinately sensitive to the reactions of social audiences and fear social evaluation.Other issues are dealt with like the question whether shyness is acquired, the link between social anxiety and disapproval concerns or the over-awareness of the evaluation of others. A fascinating study which is quite accessible even to the layman. Even though the price of this edition is a little higher than that of most books, it is a beautiful one with a very extensive bibliography.

In her novel, Mrs du Maurier portrays the rise of Julius L&eacute;vy from a peasant boy brought up near Paris in the 1870s to a successful businessman in England in the 1920s. The plot lacks ambition and is slightly naive at times. Mrs du Maurier's ignorance of the French language is obvious in many instances - for example naming Julius's daughter "Gabriel" - and her attempts at depicting the matters of the spirit a failure, as the following quotation reveals: "Elsa, coughing her life away in the little bedroom next to him, was happy in the ignorance of death like a child who believes in God." But if the reader would like to be reminded that ambition is one of the most awful human trait of character, he may find some interest in this novel.

"Author, Author", like Colm Toibin's "The Master", tells of a particular period of Henry James' life. David Lodge's novel takes place in the last twenty years of the 19th century when James' fortunes were at their lowest, culminating in his greatest failure, the opening and closing of his play "Guy Domville". At the centre of the novel is his friendship with the writer George Du Maurier. When James passes on using it for the basis of a novel, Du Maurier writes it instead and it becomes a bestseller. Du Maurier, however, has difficulty coping with success while James decides he must try harder to achieve it.David Lodge brings to life a great writer. The scenes and dialogues are witty, entertaining and informative and the book reads more like a novel than a biography. "Author, Author" is extremely well read by Christopher Kay for Clipper Audio.

Set during World War II, the story is narrated by a precociously observant neighbourhood boy. The mood shifts from sweet melancholy to anarchical fun as we discover the lives of Popo the carpenter, Man-man staging his own crucifixion, Big Foot the bully or the lovely Mrs Hereira in thrall to her monstrous husband.

Readers interested in linguistics will learn that language change can't be prevented because it is a self-regulating system which takes care of itself. All languages are capable of vocabulary expansion to deal with new areas of life their speakers need to talk about. The media, often wrongly accused of ruining a language, are actually linguistic mirrors: they reflect current language usage and extend it. Languages cannot posses good or bad qualities because no language system can ever be shown to be clearer or more logical or more beautiful or ugly than any other language system.What about the speakers of a language? Despite the widespread belief that women talk more than men, most of the available evidence suggests just the opposite. If you want to learn a foreign language, rest assured that there are no easy or difficult languages. In fact it is not even possible to perform overall measurements of the complexity of a language. Since all human languages allow the precise communication of complex messages they all require a grammatical system. Double negatives may sound appalling in English yet they exist in many other languages. It is therefore not appropriate to think in terms of logic when looking at language use.An accent is like a map which listeners perceive through their ears and it gives them information about where a speaker was born, what age they are, what gender, what level of education they have, how much they might weigh and whether they feel well or ill at the moment of speaking. And finally readers may be surprised to learn that in many ways - mainly lexical - American English is more conservative than British English.

Omar Razaghi left Iran with his parents at the age of ten and moved to Canada. At the beginning of the novel, he is in his mid twenties and has been awarded a stipend by the University of Kansas Press to fund the publication of a biography of Jules Gund, the author of a single work of fiction called &quot;The Gondola&quot;. But before Omar can start doing research for the biography, he needs the authorisation of the Gund literary trust which consists of three people: Caroline and Adam Gund and Arden Langdon, all three living in Ochos Rios, Uruguay. After having written to the trustees, Omar receives their disappointing answer: they refuse to grant him the authorisation he needs for the biography. Being a rather hesitant and indecisive young man - perhaps the archetype of the doctoral student in literature - Omar is about to give up his plans when he is convinced by his buoyant girlfriend Deidre that it is his duty not to abate, not to abandon his literary project. At this point the reader's mind is already full of questions: why don't the trustees want to grant the permission? Is there some aspect of Jules Gund's life that they want to keep secret for ever? Will Omar - considering his character - be able to change their mind?Mr Cameron's novel features subtle dialogue, reflections about love, loss, grief, posterity. The descriptions of Ochos Rios, a languid and dreamy place, are superb. Even though the atmosphere is at times as heavy as the humid air of the jungle, wit and comedy still find their place in this superbly crafted novel.

Paul Auster's novel offers a haunting picture of a devastated society with all its miseries and struggles for survival. It is highly reminiscent of George Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and although Paul Auster's novel is also set in the future, it is a chilling reflection of contemporary social reality. It is a short, sustained masterpiece, truly unforgettable.

An Australian man diagnosed with HIV undertakes a journey to Switzerland and Northern Italy. As the narrator travels along, he encounters different characters and from these meetings emerge lovely dialogues and stories. He visits Patricia Highsmith in Tegna and they talk about Ripley and Ruth Rendell, he meets Rachel Berg with her stunning story of the &quot;Baroness de St Leger and the Golden Amulet&quot;. There is Professors Eschenbaum's ebullient narration of &quot;The Disappearing Courtesan&quot; in Venice. The various dialogues of the protagonists about literature, architecture, society and history undoubtedly show what an erudite author Mr Dessaix is. But because the narrator is HIV positive, there are also many reflections throughout the novel linked to the disease. His relationship to his friend Peter, for example, who doesn't blame him for having chosen an adventurous way of life. The fact that the narrator knows not only - as we all do - that he is going to die but that he is going to do so in the near future changes his perception of time. &quot;Time now is for beguiling, not for spending profitably&quot; he says. He also dwells on the concept of solitude compared to loneliness, abandonment or desertion. He feels that certain acquaintances are to be enjoyed and then simply to be moved on from. The narrator also refuses to start crafting the approaching end of his life and states that it is essential to invest with meaning the moment we're living through. And then there is the closing idea of this remarkable novel that kindness is undervalued and that we shouldn't want to live without it.

Elizabeth Costello is a 66 year old Australian author who has written 9 novels as well as poetry, a book on bird life and journal articles. She is the recipient of several literary awards and on each occasion she is invited to give a lecture in which she expresses not only her ideas in her books but her view of religion, the lives of animals, the mission of a novel writer or various aesthetic issues.Thus the reader is confronted in Mr Coetzee's novel with a wide range of essential thoughts: how to define the function of the novel in our lives, the specificity of native African literature, "The humanities teach us humanity", the way people treat animals compared to the way the Nazis treated the Jews - a questionable comparison? - or the fact that fiction takes us out of ourselves into other lives. Elizabeth Costello also discusses poets like Rilke or Ted Hughes or the relevance of imposing Christian faith in many African countries. How should the writers deal with the question of evil and Eros in their writings? Does a writer need to have beliefs, is he allowed to change his beliefs?It is not easy to say how much Mr Coetzee wishes to tell about himself through the main character of his novel. In any case, Elizabeth Costello is a better writer than lecturer/talker: "Her strategy with interviews is to take control of the exchange" by using blocks of dialogue rehearsed in advance. "Even as a reader of her own stories she lacks animation". "Not her m&eacute;tier, argumentation. She shouldn't be there". Henceforth, her lectures often lack a structure and the audience are puzzled by her changes of topic - or sometimes lack of topic - due to the fact that she is "full of doubt, and desperate too". She feels that it is not her duty to teach or preach anything through her books but merely to show how people lived in a certain place and time.An accomplished work which deals with a wide range of philosophical, ethic, religious and moral issues that are so essential in our lives.

Mr Roberts's voluminous novel tells the story of one narrator who escaped from prison in Australia and travelled to Bombay on a false New Zealand passport. He doesn't devote much time talking about his criminal activities in his home country apart from stating that he used to rob banks and deal in drugs and then chose to abandon his wife and children for the life of a fugitive. Upon his arrival in the Indian capital, he met Prabaker Kharre, a loveable character who showed him round the city, particularly the areas rarely visited by mainstream tourists. At Leopold's, a bar where illegal business is conducted by many Indians and a few foreigners, the narrator was introduced to Karla Saaranen, a beautiful woman who is often the object of his thoughts throughout the novel due to the difficulty she has in feeling love for anyone.As he settled down in Bombay, he learned to speak Marathi and Hindi and during the adventurous years he spent in the city he became acquainted with a whole array of characters and he became to be known as Lin, Linbaba or Shantaram. The most impressive passages in the novel are the narrator's visit to Prabaker's native village of Sunder, his work in the zhopadpatti slum, his experience with the monsoon and the cholera, his work for Abdel Khader Khan and the Bombay Mafia, his stays at the Arthur Road Prison and the Colaba lock-up and finally his fight for the mujaheddin cause in the mountains of Afghanistan.Mr Roberts wonderfully shows both the generosity and the violence of the Indian people's character. The spirit of Bombay is rendered in splendid descriptions so that altogether this novel is thoroughly enjoyable to read.

"The Days of Abandonment" begins with Mario walking out on Olga, his wife of fifteen years, and their two children. It's an act which devastates Olga, who narrates this account of her 'days of abandonment.' At first the absurdity of the situation is something to preoccupy her, the question of 'Why?' It's not the first time that Mario has been tempted to leave Olga but this time there is another woman, and it's not quite as out of nowhere as she had first thought."The Days of Abandonment" is a detailed, personal account of Olga's now shattered life. Her mind wanders, she snaps at her children and at the people she encounters and her life becomes a mess.The author uses a number of devices, such as the difficulty of establishing communication but the story is presented convincingly: it reads as thoroughly authentic. "The Days of Abandonment" is harrowing because Olga is not a very good mother, she does not act very nicely to almost anyone she deals with. In particular, the ups and downs Olga experiences show that the author has a sound knowledge of the human psyche.

Nancy Kennedy is worried about her grandfather Jessie because he suffers from leukaemia. Curiously enough, Jessie's records and blood samples got lost in a fire when his doctor, Dr Buhler, had a car accident. Subsequently, Jessie was moved from Tucson Medical Centre to the Berne clinic in Thun, Switzerland, where patients are given a new chance at life thanks to a revolutionary formula called "cellular rejuvenation". Puzzled by such proceedings, Nancy and her British friend Bob Newman, a journalist, decide to travel to Thun to pay a visit to Professor Armand Grange, head of the Berne clinic, to persuade him to let them see and talk to Jessie.To their astonishment, the clinic is guarded by uniformed armed men and Doberman watchdogs so that it resembles more a fortress than a hospital. Bob manages to distract Dr Novak's attention for a few minutes and Jessie confesses to Linda that a strange experiment is being carried out at the clinic and that some patients do not survive the experiment.On their way back to Berne, Bob and Linda nearly crash into a snowplough which suddenly emerges from nowhere in front of their car.

When Major Paul Sherman of the London Bureau of Interpol arrives at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, he is not greeted in a very smooth manner. Indeed, he is viciously struck in the solar plexus by the airline bag of a swarthy man in a black coat. As Sherman starts to investigate the death of Jimmy Duclos, he wonders why his presence in Holland is so undesirable, all the more since he quickly notices that he is being followed by the grey nondescript anonymity of a man. Skilfully reversing the roles, Sherman follows the mysterious man who leads him unawares to the warehouse of a company called "Morgenstern and Muggenthaler". After having succeeded to penetrate the warehouse, Sherman finds the astonishing array of thousands of puppets identical in shape and size and, more surprisingly so, row upon row of books entitled "The Gabriel Bible". But why does each volume of these Bibles have a hole that was smoothly scooped out of its centre so that it extends almost to the entire with of the book? And why do these Bibles have a fly-leaf with the printed inscription: "With the Compliments of the First Reformed Church of the American Huguenot Society"? Well, surely not an easy mystery to solve for Major Sherman...

Dr Abby Dolan moved to Patience, California, to work at the Regional Hospital because her fianc? Josh found work at Colstar International in the same town. Colstar is the largest producer of portable power sources and they specialise in producing several types of batteries. Truly enough, Patience owes its wealth to this large company. After about five weeks in Patience, Abby notices that Josh is becoming irritable, distracted, easily fatigued and more and more frequently suffers from violent headaches which make him reach for the bottle, something he never used to do before. Furthermore, several patients treated by Abby seem to suffer from the same symptoms as Josh. After having had their blood analysed by an independent laboratory, it appears that these patients were all contaminated by cadmium. Colstar refuses to locate the source of the contamination because it would cost them too much to close the plant for any length of time. When Abby's investigations become too pressing, the director of Patience Regional Hospital, Joe Henderson, asks her to resign, menacing her with the falsified report on the death of one of her patients, Peggy Wheaton. But it is only when one night, returning home from work, Abby is shot at several times that she understands that the threat from Colstar is not to be taken lightly...A very good medical thriller.

In this masterpiece, Louis de Berni&egrave;res portrays the fate of the small Greek island of Cephallonia and its inhabitants during a time span ranging from before the second World War to the 1990s. There is a flurry of characters drawn with care and humour. Dr Iannis with his unsuccessful attempt at writing "The New History of Cephallonia", his daughter Pelagia, affectionately nicknamed Koritsimou, her lover Megalo Velisarios "self-proclaimed as the strongest man who has ever lived", the ebullient father Arsenios, the pathetic soldier Carlo Piero Guercio and of course Captain Antonio Corelli the mandolin player who manages to win Pelagia's heart almost as soon as he arrives on the island.It is a moving account of Cephallonia during the second World War when it was occupied by German, Italian and British forces. The author pictures the same horrors of war which have been described many times in other novels but he does so in an original way which, interestingly enough does by no means lack in humour. The scenes are poignant and the characters are very lively and one can't help feeling a strong empathy for those Greek islanders. The chapter called "The Duce" featuring a vitriolic characterization of Mussolini is a true delight. A novel which can be recommended without reservations what so ever to readers interested in excellent literature.

The author starts by pointing out that linguistically the word "disgust" in English is linked to the word "taste" ("gustus" in Latin). It describes actions or things which are repulsive, revolting or abhorrent principally because they become polluting by being out of place. Freud's theories are efforts to overcome a deep disgust with sex which is often the cause for anxiety, neurosis and psychosis. Disgust is also a psychic need to avoid reminders of our animal origins and it is accompanied by ideas of some sort of danger like pollution, contamination or defilement. It has the function of protecting our organism from dangerous matter. And disgust is culturally and socially determined.The author argues that disgust has powerful image-generating capacities and that it plays a part in organising and internalising many of our attitudes toward the moral, social and political domains. He also demonstrates how the conceptualisation of disgust varies by virtue of the sense doing the perceiving: touch, smell, taste or vision. The body's orifices and wastes are not forgotten either: mouth, anus, genitals, nose, ears and skin. Moving away from the visceral, Mr Miller takes up the delicate issue of the relationships of disgust to desire and desire to prohibition. He also discusses the changing styles of disgust and the disgusting through time and then moves to the issue that disgust is a moral sentiment. Finally he concentrates on disgust in the political and social realms where it confronts democracy and the idea of equality.A fascinating study with plenty of references to famous writers like Orwell, Shakespeare, Sartre or Darwin. There is also an exhaustive bibliography which will help readers find related studies to the concept of disgust.

In the first part of his novel, Mr de Botton introduces his main character, Alice, and discusses the notion of reality with the help of such philosophers as Heraclitus, Plato, Hegel or Shopenhauer and poses the question, following Oscar Wilde, whether art imitates life or life that imitates art. We may for instance like Paris more than London because we know the former city through the eyes of painters like Manet, Degas or Pissaro or through films by Truffaut or Godard. The author then discusses the difference between imitative and autonomous desire and then engages in the argument that Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary is the first novel (published in 1856) which links the two activities of sex and shopping which are psychologically intertwined.Then Alice meets Eric at a party and this gives the author the opportunity to write about love, indeterminacy, the idealisation of the lover, the value systems in a love relationship or the power in love. Do we love the partner's money, body, achievements, weaknesses or anxieties? Is thinking problem-induced or problem-inducing? How does the cultural baggage of infancy and youth, of relations and traditions influence one's relationship with a partner?This book is an original hybrid, part novel, part philosophical reverie which is not without charm. Some readers have complained that Alain de Botton all too often states the obvious and it is true that his novel does not present any revelations but it is enjoyable to read nevertheless.

Mr Adair portrays the less than original English character of Gideon who takes a teaching post at a Berlitz school in Paris in the 1980s. After getting to know the gay scene, Gideon witnesses his acquaintances fall under the spell if the first Aids wave as the result of their wild fornication and libertine banter.Readers will find very little compassion for any of the characters. The language is crude, the tale banal. Had Mr Adair published his novel 15 years ago, it may have been of interest but unfortunately today, what the author presents as "a true story" in page 1 is completely devoid of originality.

Dr Yalom's novel is set in Vienna at the end of the 19th century, on the eve of the birth of psychoanalysis. The main characters are the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Dr Joseph Bauer, one of the founders of psychoanalysis, and a then young (the year is 1882) medical intern called Sigmund Freud. As these protagonists discuss their ideas, preoccupations and frustrations, they create an original plot of a fictional relationship between an exceptional analysand and a talented analyst. As the fictional dialogue between Breuer and Nietzsche unfolds, the reader becomes aware of the fact that at this epoch it must have been the first time that a doctor realised that what mattered is not what a patient said but that he said it. These were truly the first steps towards psychotherapy. Breuer's task was not made easy by Nietzsche's character. His social fears and his misanthropy made him select an impersonal and distant style. His tone was often harsh and brittle, particularly when he talked about his deceptive lover, Lou Salom&eacute;, a woman Nietzsche actually met in the spring of 1882. The unpleasant experience he had with this one and only love affair made him resentful towards women. He felt that they corrupted and spoiled him, he avoided them because he thought that he was ill suited for them. This partly explains Nietzsche's total isolation, his feeling of belonging nowhere, having no lover, no circle of friends, no home, no family hearth, his life sounding like a hollow echo.A wonderful achievement showing sad and troubled characters in an intriguing cross-discussion of philosophy and emerging psychotherapy, yet as gripping to read as a detective story.

In this valuable study, Dr Laing proposes to examine the way some individuals are very proficient in acquiring a false self in order to adapt to false realities and to give an account of specifically personal forms of depersonalisation and disintegration. It is no small task for the therapist to articulate what the patient's "world" is and his way of being in it in order to outline his psychopathology. The author states that if we look at his actions as signs of a disease, we impose categories of thoughts on the patient in our effort to try to explain his mental state and it isn't easy for the therapist to transpose himself into the patient's strange and alien view of world in order to understand his existential position.Dr Laing states that many patients suffer from "ontological insecurity" because they feel insubstantial, the ordinary circumstances of life constituting a continual threat to their own existence. He mentions personalities like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Francis Bacon. Then Dr Laing proceeds by giving the account of three forms of anxiety encountered by the ontologically insecure subject: engulfment, implosion and petrification. To illustrate these three forms, the author describes the case of Mrs R. who suffered from agoraphobia and schizohphrenic withdrawal.Interestingly enough, the schizoid individual constantly feels vulnerable as he is exposed by the look of another person and that is why he fears live dialectical relationships with live people and prefers to relate himself to depersonalised persons or to phantoms of his own fantasies, thus the distinction between the "embodied" and "unembodied" self. Such an individual is afraid of the world, frightened that any impingement will be total and engulfing. He is afraid of letting himself "go", of coming out of himself or of losing himself because he feels that he will be depleted, exhausted, emptied, robbed or sucked dry. So for the schizoid individual, direct participation in life is felt as being at a risk of being destroyed by life. One aspect of this individual's ontological insecurity is the precariousness of his subjective sense of his own aliveness and the sense that others threaten this tentative feeling. The schizoid individual strongly believes in his own destructiveness by others. This view is in accord to the existentialist's philosophy represented by Jean-Paul Sartre who stated in his famous theatre play "Huis Clos" that "L'enfer, c'est les autres."Thus a false self can arise in the individual which is in compliance with the intentions and expectations of the other or with what are imagined to be the other's intentions or expectations. Indeed, the self-conscious person feels he is more the object of other people's interest than in fact he is. And so the schizoid individual carries out defences like being like everyone else, being someone other than oneself, playing a part, being nobody or being incognito and anonymous. So if the gaze of others is experienced as a threat, there is a constant dread and resentment at being turned into someone else's thing (what Sartre called "l'tre-pour-autrui"), of being penetrated by him, and a sense of being in someone else's power and control. Freedom then consists in being inaccessible. Love too for schizoid individuals is viewed as disguised persecution since it aims to turn him into an object of the other.This type of individual can be himself in safety only in isolation. With others he plays an elaborate game of pretence and his social life is felt to be false and futile. But the more he keeps his "true self" concealed and unseen, the more he presents to others a false front and the more compulsive this fake presentation of himself becomes. This can lead to a complete disintegration of the personality.

Dans ce mince volume, le narrateur passe en revue quelques instants marquants de son existence &agrave; Paris de 1945 &agrave; 2001. Mais comme toujours chez Patrick Modiano, la m&eacute;moire est floue et peu fiable et ce qui reste finalement, ce sont des impressions, des sensations et des personnages flous. Le narrateur relate sa vie de pensionnaire au lyc&eacute;e, ses premi&egrave;res acquisitions dans la collection des Livres de Poche et un p&egrave;re qui fr&eacute;quente toutes sortes de gens - "A quoi lui servaient-ils exactement?" - et dont la profession est ind&eacute;termin&eacute;e. A-t-il travaill&eacute; pour cette "Union mini&egrave;re indochinoise"? En tout cas il a fini par tre insolvable puisque les huissiers sont venus un jour pour emporter ses vtements.Puis il y a eu son s&eacute;jour dans un internat de Haute-Savoie, les excursions &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve. Et ses rencontres avec Raymond Queneau en 1962, l'acceptation de son premier livre en 1967.Il ne lui reste plus que des minuscules points de rep&egrave;re, des "lambeaux de souvenirs", des inconnus auxquels il ne peut donner une forme pr&eacute;cise et il lui semble avoir habit&eacute; dans une vie ant&eacute;rieure.

This is the story of Sampath "Good Fortune" Chawla, an idle young man who spends many hours dreaming in the tea stalls and singing to himself in public gardens of Shahkot. At the post office he spends time reading the mail instead of working and soon loses his job. Then he decides to take permanent residence in the fork of a guava tree in a marvellous orchard upon a hillside and become a hermit. Unfortunately his family quickly realise that Sampath could make their fortune and so a stream of worshipers start visiting Sampath's tree, asking for blessing while his parents, in a nearby tea stall, sell flower garlands, fruit, incense and souvenirs.In a witty and sharp prose Ms Desai mocks pious devotion, official incompetence, domestic tiffs, young love, marriage customs, sacred monkeys and the novel is a delightfully funny satire of the customs of India.

In his first novel published in 1982, Mr Galgut tells the tragic tale of three boys of about 16 who are sent to Bleda Reformatory in South Africa, a correctional facility for under-age delinquents, the principal of which is Mr Eugene Hall. There is Joseph Hamilton, a rather plump boy of unsubtle features and of nervous composure. Scott Berry, a shy brown-eyed boy. Raoul Dean, slim and indifferent. Although the three boys were raised in different social backgrounds, they used to spend a great deal of time together. Their deviant behaviour started with small theft, breaking shop windows and resisting their parents' authority. That is why they were convicted by a children's court to stay at Bleda Reformatory until the age of 18. But to Mr Hull's great disappointment it soon transpires that the three boys are unwilling to settle into the quiet and reverential attitude which is expected of the residents at Blenda.A harrowing account of three teenaged boys growing up in violence, resentment and vengeance, their life completely devoid of peace, joy and contentment. Once again, a South African author shows us that life in that part of the world is more a matter of survival than of living. Mr Galgut's achievement can easily be compared to some of his compatriots like Andr&eacute; Brink, Nadine Gordimer or J. M. Coetzee.

The title of this review is the subtitle used by Mrs Lawrence for her book. And indeed readers will discover some harrowing facts about the way the industry processes our everyday food. If you don't know what mechanically recovered meat is, how chickens are raised in Brazil, that when you order chicken in a restaurant you may in fact be eating 30% beef, that a farm is no longer a place where food is grown but an industrial complex of packing sheds around lorry parks or that the conditions under which illegal immigrants pick fruit and vegetables in Spain can be compared to "South African apartheid". The author visited a giant refrigerated packing plant near Aylesford which reminded her of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis"! Did you know that a standard shopping basket in a supermarket with 20 fresh foods represents an average accumulation of 100 000 "food miles"? One example: the mangetout or asparagus from Peru you buy have a journey of 6312 miles behind them... Or that 60% of the factory bread consumed in Britain is produced by plants belonging to two giants - who call themselves "bakeries" - British Bakeries and Allied Bakeries?Well Mrs Lawrence has plenty of examples in store in her study which will surprise many a reader about the way our modern food is manufactured and processed. In the same vein, readers may also be interested in Joanna Blythman's very instructive discussion of supermarket policies in her book "Shopped".

On a flight from Paris to London, the narrator starts a conversation with a young woman called Chloe who happens to be sitting next to him. After their arrival, they meet again and subsequently start a serious love affair. But after some time Cloe loses interest and soon she confesses that she has an affair with the narrator's friend Will. The former falls into depression and then botches a suicide attempt while Cloe follows Will to the United States. But soon the narrator meets Rachel at a dinner party and she accepts his invitation to dine with him the following week.The characters and the plot are lively and witty and there are plenty of passages in which Mr de Botton reflects on character, jealousy, passion and other emotions related to the feeling of love. There are quotations from and references to Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Pascal, Stendhal, Freud, Roland Barthes and many other philosophers and writers. The whole novel is the work of both an erudite and witty author who presents the reader with lots of wise and illuminating insights. Perhaps not all of these insights are original but with so many famous names cited, they are organised in an original manner which is very entertaining to read.

The other woman in Toru's life is Midori who is the opposite of Naoko: a sexually liberated young woman with a petulant and exuberant character.A beautiful blending of the music, the atmosphere and the ethos which were predominant in the late 1960s with the story of Toru, a college student's erotic coming of age. The novel beautifully relates a young man's first, hopeless and romantic love.

The first story called The Year of the Gibbet takes the reader back to 1776 when King George's ships came to conquer Manhattan. It is the sad tale of a boy of ten whose mother becomes a traitor with the British in order to sustain her children.The second story is that of Julius in the 1850s who falls in love with a girl below his rank, a fact which will lead his father to take an unpardonable measure. Love denied can make us mad indeed.In the third story Danny Silver is the narrator's patient whose psychological problem originated in a suffocating maternal relationship. He observed the suffering of a woman he hired for sex, Kim Lee, was affected by it and launched himself in a reckless trajectory with her. The 9/11 terror attacks were so destructive on Danny's psyche that not only did he buy sex but bought a sort of emotional intimacy with a woman who was even more damaged than himself and mistook the comfort it gave him for love.A stunning trio of tales, they are sly and thought-provoking because the author evokes the insanity and violence underlying the surface of everyday life.

Ronald Forrester is an English forester in Simla, India, where he came to see what life was like in, ironically, a country without trees. In 1918 during a violent storm which floods the country, this difficult and taciturn man encounters a young woman called Armrita in a cave. After an expert and violent [adult] scene, the Englishman is killed by the flood and Armrita is taken to Agra to be married to Razdan, a distinguished court pleader who belongs to one of the highest and most distinguished castes in all Hindustan. Some months later, Armrita gives birth to a son, Pran Nath, who is actually Ronald Forrester's child, and dies after delivering the baby. A few years later, when Razdan learns that is son is the &quot;illegitimate child of a casteless, filth eating, left-and-right-hand-confusing Englishman&quot;, he dies of shock. Now an orphan, Pran Nath is thrown out of the house by the chowkidar and becomes one of the many homeless of Agra.So begins the epic life of a young boy of six in India. His odyssey-like journey will take him from Agra to the red light district of Bombay, then to the brick cloisters of the University of Oxford and finally to Fotseland, in Africa. It is the sad story of a man never understanding who he really is, neither really Indian nor really English, despite all his efforts. Mr Kunzru meditates on the construction of identity, self deprecation, miscegenation and racism in an ambitious and remarkable first novel.

Eight men are undertaking the armed robbery of a storage house at Gatwick airport. They intend to steal 24 boxes containing the latest Pentium chips worth nearly a million pounds. But things don't go according to plan: they are surrounded by the police and one policeman is shot. All of them are arrested, charged with attempted murder and armed robbery and brought on remand to Shelton prison, a Category A facility.Among the arrested men there is "Bob McDonald" who is actually Dan Shepherd, member of Superintend Sam Hargrove's undercover unit, who infiltrated the gang of armed robbers. Indeed his arrest will serve the following purpose: at Shelton there is a certain Gerald Carpenter charged with bringing over 800 kilos of heroin to Britain and the police suspect him of running things from behind bars. The police need Shepherd to watch Carpenter closely because a few days earlier Trish Elliot, an undercover drugs officer, was shot and they believe that only Carpenter could afford to have it done. Since there may be a corrupt officer at Shelton, they need Shepherd to sniff out the inside man. This is going to be a perilous mission indeed in spite of Hargrove's assurance that if Shepherd needs to be pulled out, his team will always be there to back him up.Very good suspense.

This short novel is based on a report written by a doctor called William Tabor who sets off to meet Dr John Cake in Halstead near Woodham, shortly before the latter's death on 17 August 1844. Dr Cake is a frail man suffering from tuberculosis but his intellectual strength is still intact. Both men's passion is poetry and the conversation unfolds around great poets like Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelly or Keats. But it is when Dr Cake expresses some doubts about Keats's death that the two men start reflecting on the afterlife of poets. What if Keats had decided to stage his own disappearance and continued to live under another identity? Strangely enough, like Keats, Dr Cake was born in 1795, went to school near London, started working as a doctor and then gave it up to devote himself to poetry. And why was Dr Cake buried with no name on the brass plate screwed on his coffin-lid? Perhaps &quot;Dr Cake&quot; is an invention after all...

Alan Sherwood, a middle-aged solicitor is spending a holiday in Vif, a somnolent village on the Franco-Swiss border. As he catches a glimpse of a woman on the platform of the station, he is reminded of Sarah Miller who he once passionately loved.Little by little the reader discovers who this woman was as Alan's recollections of his youth slowly unfold. The pattern of their relationship was quite strange because as soon as Alan saw Sarah, he knew that he should eternally seek to attract her attention. Though beautiful, Sarah was vain, unreliable, feckless, insouciant and literally unable to take any matter seriously, always eluding Alan's questions and never being quite capable of concentrating on the subject at hand. An elusive femme fatale, always expecting the world to attend to her needs, her only consistency being her extremely inconsistent nature. Perhaps that was partly why Alan was so irresistibly attracted to her. In any event Sarah never quite responded to his advances so Alan ended up by marrying Angela and in the course of the plot we discover that she died only after eleven months of marriage and after having given birth to a stillborn girl.Mrs Brookner admirably shows through the numerous characters in her novel how people's states alter depending on whether they are in love, lonely, married, young, old or, like Alan, haunted by the memory of a woman he could never possess. The maturity and the depth of the author's perceptions are mesmerising and her fiction is powerful and disturbing.

First the author pictures the history of the rise of fast food in the United States with the McDonald's brothers. Then he takes the strong impulse we all feel - our craving for sweet, salty, fatty fast foods - and make us think about it. "Chew On This" tells us where fast food comes from, who produces it, what it contains and what happens when we consume it. The book is about fast food and the world it has created.Mr Schlosser shows us that the companies which sell fast food don't want us to think about it as fast food. They don't want us to know where it comes from and how it is made. They just want us to buy it. Indeed no fast food chain ever shows us the factories where chips are produced. They would never dare show us the slaughterhouses where cattle are processed into ground beef. We will never know what strange-sounding chemicals flavour our milkshakes. We will never se an advertisement showing overweight and unhealthy children stuffing their faces with greasy fries at a fast food restaurant.In this study readers will learn how and why it is vital for fast food chains to get children into their restaurants, how they treat the teenagers employed in their kitchens and how they make their food since it is an industry which both feeds and feeds off the young.Readers already acquainted with Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" will probably find that this book is simply an enlarged version of the previous one. In other words reading "Fast Food Nation" is quite enough to convince you that fast food is bad for you.

Otto Korner is a Holocaust survivor and now lives in the Emma Lazarus house for the elderly in New York. The reader gets acquainted with his fellow residents, a humorous gang of Jewish senior citizens. They are rehearsing for a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Otto finds himself in the role of the Prince. As the staging of the play progresses, Otto's thoughts often drift in the past and he recalls his times as a promising young poet in Berlin, his studies in Zurich and his frequent meetings with a group of Dadaist artists. He also remembers the early atrocities of the Nazi regime when, so he believes, he betrayed his family and his people. A beautiful first novel in the same vein as Isaac Singer, Saul Bellow or W.G. Sebald.

Herbert White lives a strange life in Saint Paul in 1939. He's a very lonely man, has no friends, is profoundly attached to his daily routines and is an amateur photographer. He particularly likes taking pictures of taxi dancers working at the Aragon Ballroom where Herbert occasionally goes. And so he met Charlie Mortensen - also called Carla Marie LaBreque - and Ruby Fahey. Due to Herbert's eccentric way of life as a recluse, he doesn't feel very comfortable in the presence of women. All the photography sessions taking place at his apartment, Herbert's behaviour is always uneasy whenever a woman comes for posing. When Charlie Mortensen is found dead by strangulation on 30 Sptember 1939 and Ruby Fahey (killed in the same manner) on 22 October, the police suspect Herbert White and arrest him. Slowly White will be drawn into signing a confession stating that he killed the two women. But Lieutenant Wesley Horner becomes suspicious: why did Hebert White state in his confession that he killed the women &quot;by battery to the head&quot; when both of them died from strangulation?Truth vs. fiction, past vs. present, love vs. hatred, faith and memory are the themes illuminated masterfully by Robert Clark. This is not a mystery story in the classic sense but rather a complex, intriguing and fascinating journey into the human psyche. A beautiful book.

In this heart-wrenching and epic novel, Mr Powers tells two parallel stories both set in the town of Lacewood, Illinois. The first one is about Laura Rowen Bodey, divorced mother of Ellen, aged seventeen, and Tim, aged twelve. Laura is a successful real-estate agent at Next Millennium Realty. But one day, doctors tell Laura that she has ovarian cancer. The other story is about a company begun by three merchant brothers in the 1850s in Boston, Clare Soap and Chemical. By the turn of the Millennium, this company has turned into a large multiconglomerate with factories in Lacewood, Laura Bodey's hometown. A powerful, subtle and provocative novel accurately depicting the messianism of corporate America. Laura's story is one of the excruciating depth of vulnerability whereas the one about Clare Chemicals shows Mr Powers' horizon-busting breath of knowledge. His prose is erudite, penetrating and splendidly written.

It is not an easy task describing Mr Coe's novel in a few lines. This is not only due to the twisty nature of the plot - intermittently describing events nearly 10 years distant in time - but also to the great number of characters often involved in confusing situations resulting from witty misunderstandings. This is not in the least to say that the novel is confusing, on the contrary, the non-linear plot is an essential part of the originality of "The House of Sleep".In the 1980s a group of students were studying at the imposing college of Ashdown on the English South Coast before drifting apart. A decade later, Ashdown has become the Dudden Clinic where the increasingly unstable Dr Dudden investigates the mechanisms of sleep, using both animals and human beings for his various experiments. Due to a series of coincidences involving various disorders in their sleep patterns, these students are drawn back together. Sarah is narcoleptic, she has dreams so vivid that she can't distinguish them from real events, Robert whose identity is about to change completely due to misunderstandings that come from his/her condition and Terry, the insomniac film critic who spends his nights with his obsessions with movies. And finally Dr Dudden who considers sleep as a disease shortening people's lives by a third.A compelling novel about love, loss and obsession.

Philip Wardman is a young man working for Roseberry Lawn Interiors. He is of quiet, sedate character and he hates violence of any kind. At his sister's wedding, Philip meets her bridesmaid Senta Pelham and falls in love with her. She has a white complexion and silver hair thus resembling Flora, the stone statue in Philip?s mother?s garden. Philip's love for Senta grows passionate until one day she claims that they both have to kill somebody to seal their love for each other. And so begins an awkward journey through sick and weak minds, through an emotional, erotic and irrational relationship. Mrs Rendell's novel is appalling, shocking, convincing and relentlessly gripping. Mr William Gaminara offers a respectable performance in this audio book and I enjoyed very much listening to his reading.

Mrs Brookner portrays the character of Julius Herz, a 73 year old Jewish gentleman whose parents were exiles to London from Germany shortly before the end of the Second World War. His father - and later Julius himself - used to work in a shop in Edgware Road belonging to one ebullient Ostrovski. Julius's brother Freddy showed an early talent for the violin so his parents were intent on making a prodigal performer out of him at all cost and despite the fact that that he was "sick before and after every performance" since the audience always attended his recitals as "a phenomenon, a fairground spectacle." Naturally the parents' disappointment was all the deeper when their "cherished prodigy" had to abandon his career as a violinist after a breakdown.Now that Julius is the only remaining of what used to be a family of four, he reflects on his life as he tries to get accustomed to his new flat in Chiltern Street, all the more so since new initiatives are no longer within his reach. He feels that the routine of his empty days bring him no reward, most of his actions being eternally undertaken with a sigh. After divorcing his wife Josie Burns, Julius no longer even has the heart for solitary holidays. He likes spending his time alone, aware that in solitude nobody but himself can register his decline, unable to dislodge his melancholia and almost feeling compelled by destiny to live like a recluse. Yet he knows that a solitary way of life is the only one that suits his temperament and so the time for reflecting over his past is ample. And these recollections Julius sees as a "lifetime of repeated episodes of defeat" which he considers as the essence of his sentimental education, a permanent reminder that he wasted his life.So for a man like Herz, is there going to be anything next but death, is there a next big thing to come? After closing the book, the reader may not know how to answer the question but perhaps this is beside the point because Mrs Brookner's achievement lies in the way she captures the anxieties due to old age, to a world becoming increasingly more alien because of its modernity and to memories of a lifetime one wishes one had spent in a different manner.

The brotherhood of the grape consists of a group of men gathering at the Angelo Masso winery in San Elmo. There is Angelo himself, Cavallero, Zarlingo, Benedetti, Antrilli, Mascarini and Nicholas. During their meetings, they gamble, brawl and of course drink heavily. Nicholas Molise and his wife Maria brought up four children now in their fifties, Mario, Virgil, Stella and Henry, the latter being the narrator in Mr Fante's both tragic and funny tale. Nicholas is now 76 and he used to work as a contractor and he built many imposing buildings in San Elmo. A passionate man of Italian origin, the head of the family is described by Henry as "a judge, jury and executioner, Jehovah himself". He scorns his sons because, to his bitter disappointment, none of them became a stonemason. And now Nick pesters Henry to join him in an absurd project of building of a smokehouse up in the Sierra mountains...It is both the funny and sad tale of a son watching his father age, wait, mark time and become increasingly lonelier. But there is anger too in Henry's memories when he remembers his father's ignorance, he who kept books out of Henry's range, despised them, ignored them. His ranting, threats, greed, bullying and gambling are hard to forget. Henry can't but despise his father's old bones and skin, his wine-soaked oldness, his sinful and sodden friends. He can barely contain his anger at being trapped on an absurd safari into the mountains because of his father's vanity, to prove himself he is still "a hotshot stonemason". Yet Henry is finally the only son who stands by his father's side as his final moment approaches...The novel is brimming with love, violence, death, religion and also plenty of humour because the author's prose is honest, evocative and intimate.

Touching and wonderfully funny. &quot;In Custody&quot; is woven around the yearnings and calamities of Deven, a small-town scholar from Mirpore in the north of India. An improvised college lecturer, Deven sees a way to escape from the meanness of his daily life when he is asked to interview India's greatest Urdu poet, Nur. But every attempt will only end up in desaster.A beautiful book, mingling melancholy, disappointment and lots of humour. I recommend it most warmly.

Piero Piambotto, &quot;Piambo&quot;, is one of the most sought after portraitists in New York in the middle of the 19th century. One day he is accosted by one blind Watkin telling him that his employer wants to commission him to paint her portrait. Provided that he manages to disengage himself from his current promises at once, Watkin's employer is willing to pay Piambo three times as much as he would have earned with his other engagements. Piambo agrees and he is soon to meet the mysterious Mrs Chrabuque at her place. She appears behind a screen and explains to Piambo that he will have to paint her without ever being allowed to cast an eye on her. He will be allowed to visit Mrs Chrabuque for an hour daily and from the information she will give him, he will have to construct in his mind an image of her and paint her. If Piambo manages to capture her likeness, she is ready to double the already overwhelming money she is willing to pay him.The idea for the plot of this novel is excellent and it would have been interesting to follow the painter's mind to see how he succeeds in actually picturing a face he is not allowed to see. Unfortunately, Piambo is soon drawn into an adventure with Shenz, a fellow artist, who persuades him to try to cheat and find a way to discover what Mrs Charbuque looks like. Then there Mrs Charbuque's long narrative about her father being a crystalogogist and his science of reading snow flakes. In the end there is so much mysticism that the topic of art and painting slides into the background as we watch Piambo being involved, as he states himself, into an &quot;affair resembling a convoluted dream shattered by waking&quot; which poses the question of the credibility of the whole plot.

Dr Rubin's stories are drawn from her clinical practice and her experience with her patients. The reader meets Eve Gordon who endured a harrowing childhood with her alcoholic parents; now 39, she lives a life of virtual isolation and desperately wants to become her therapist's friend. Many sessions are spent with Eve curled up in the corner of the practice without uttering a single word. Bruce Marins, a cripple - a &quot;Thalidomide baby&quot;, a drug taken by his mother to cure her morning sickness - who rejects sympathy as being patronising, who feels anger and distrust of people around him and who sees deceit, pity and rejection wherever he turns. As Dr Rubin is about to greet Bonnie Paulsen and Jerry Stillman in her office, she is far from picturing the way these two patients are going to deceive her with their egregious lies and carefully plotted hoax - &quot;How easily any patient can defeat even the most artful and accomplished therapist.&quot; she writes! Jake Garvin suffers from manic-depressive psychosis and so needs help because he's having trouble writing his dissertation for his degree. This is all the more urgent since the two job offers Jake has received depend on his finishing his dissertation. A case which will unfortunately end very tragically. Richard Durbin and Valerie Goldner are a yuppie couple. But why does Richard stubbornly refuse to have a child with Valerie? What mysterious event in his past makes him refuse to become a father? And finally there is the case of Delfina Ortega, a Mexican American, who was pregnant at 16, then became an excellent high school student graduating near the top of her class, who was subsequently awarded full scholarship to the university and then, when she was accepted to a graduate programme in Latin American history, she falls into a panic attack.Dr Rubin's cases are a wonderful read for those of us who are mere laymen in the field of psychology.

The main character, Graham Broadbent, is a well-known author who decides to attend a school reunion. While he is in town a knock comes at his hotel room door, and an attractive nineteen-year-old woman, Christa, enters and declares that he is her father. Indeed Graham remembers having had an affair with Christa's mother, Peggy, a girl known for her exquisite acting in George Bernard Shaw's "St. Joan". Graham is able to eliminate himself from the fatherhood with some arithmetical calculations, but his curiosity is aroused.As luck would have it, Peggy has concluded that Graham must be the father, with the apparent hope that some of Graham's rather minimal celebrity will rub off. She arranges a celebratory dinner at which she makes the announcement of Graham's paternity to her adult son - who, to everyone's surprise, rejects it vehemently and with a great deal of genuine anger.No one is surprised when Peggy goes missing immediately after this disastrous dinner, especially when she leaves behind a note indicating that she's gone off with some bloke. Apparently this isn't an unusual event. As the days go by and no one hears from her, however, it appears that something more sinister has happened...The novel is very well read by Gordon Griffin for Soundings Audiobooks.

This case takes inspector Aurelio Zen to the Dolomites to the site where a body has been found in an abandoned military tunnel. With the help of Rudi Redel, Zen treads carefully to the place where the supposed suicide took place. However, evidence shows that other people must have been present in the tunnel so Zen must assume that a murder cannot be excluded. The situation becomes even more intricate when the still unidentified body is stolen from the morgue at the Defence Ministry! All the usual ingredients in Mr Dibdin's latest murder mystery: excellent suspense, a sympathetic Aurelio Zen (with a new girlfriend!) and plenty of ironical and amusing observations about our beloved Italy. Michael Tudor Barnes's fantastic reading is well worth buying this audiobook.

Magda is a lonely and embittered spinster who lives on a sheep farm in the heart of South Africa. Her mother died in childbirth, the cause of which Magda attributes to her father's "relentless sexual demands". Her bitterness comes from the fact that she feels that she has been an absence all her life to her father. They have always fronted each other in silence and so Magda became an unhappy peasant, "a miserable black virgin, "the mad hag" she is destined to be, having grown up with the servants' children.Deprived of human intercourse, Magda realises that she overvalues the imagination. That is why when her father brings home a new bride, she fantacises of killing them both with an axe. The lonely farm is the place where she is "devoured by boredom", engulfed in the "monologue of the self" like a maze of words out of which she can't escape and she feels doomed to expire there "in the heart of the country", "in the middle of nowhere", a place she considers "was never intended that people should live here". Magda's father's sexual relationship with Hendrik's wife, the black servant, only adds to her dismay. It thus doesn't come as a surprise, given Magda's psychological disposition, that she often dreams of burning everything down and that she is actually about to murder the one person she considers responsible for her despair. After that, what is left for her but an inexorable descent into madness?As Andr&eacute; Brink stated about this novel: "It says something about loneliness, about craving for love, about the relation between master and slave and between white and black, and about a man's earthly anguish and longing for salvation - in a way you do not easily escape from once it has gripped you".

As Adam Sokolovitch claims that the urge to kill is deeply rooted in every human mind, the reader soon discovers how earnestly these words have to be taken. There is Ardei, always worried, although, as he states, &quot;For Heaven's sake, nothing has ever happened to me.&quot; And finally one narrator, staring into the night, admiring the &quot;silent stars&quot; and wondering why his mind is perpetually anguished and tormented - in the end coming to the conclusion that it must be due to one's lifelong struggle against death.

Knut Hamsun's novel tells the story of a young writer living in Christiana (nowadays Oslo) in Norway at the end of the 19th century. As it was extremely difficult for him to make a living from the few newspaper articles he managed to sell for a few kroner, he constantly lived on the verge of famine. Very often his psyche was badly affected by numerous refusals, hopes built up and knocked down so that he often lost courage. His extreme poverty forced the writer to live in rooms &quot;not furnished in a way appropriate to intellectual effort&quot; which also had a negative impact on his literary muse.Hamsun never mentions his hero's name; it is as if he were a perpetual foreigner in his surroundings and his hunger transforms him into a sociopath: he is famished not because he cannot find a job in Christiana but because he is stubbornly determined to live from his writing, although he is just a beginner. His loneliness is the consequence both of his constant striving for food and for inspiration and his inability to make friends because he has no patience for others. Another interesting aspect is the young writer's ambiguous feeling towards God whom he both fears and curses for his fate, but destiny neither provides him with inspiration nor allows him to die; he is constantly saved by temporary deliverance - an editor accepts one of his articles, he is paid five kroner and he is saved for a few days until the ordeal begins again. The hero is so estranged from his environment that he emerges almost lifeless. He has no plans for the future, expecting some happy chance, almost always resigned and melancholy. The young writer is nothing but a chain of moods changing constantly, often without consistency. He doubts the existence of God, yet he prays to Him. He loves yet at the same time belittles this love. He strives for literary revelation yet he is frivolous in his approach to literature.The power of &quot;Hunger&quot; is that doubt found in Hamsun its narrator par excellence.

In this thriller, Mrs Rendell portrays a 50 year old psychopath called Arthur Johnson. He fits exactly the definition of a psychopathic person. He is asocial, self centred, impulsive and suffers from an acute anxiety nurosis. He has a strong need to preserve an immaculate ego, he is paranoiac, fears retribution and has an urgent need to be thought well by all people. And men like him cannot be reassured because their belief in their own worthlessness is so intense. Self-confidence cannot be implanted in Arthur anymore at the age of 50. That's why he fears other people - they represent a menace to his own integrity - and so he lives in private isolation.Characteristically for a psychotic mind, Arthur is unable to form emotional relationships and he has no social ways of coping with his frustrations. This is certainly why Arthur keeps a plastic shop window model in his cellar. This model is dressed in his Auntie Gracie's clothes - for him she is the image of a mother, wife, counsellor, housekeeper and sole friend - which Arthur delights in "strangulating" regularly at night.A very good thriller which shows that Mrs Rendell understands how a psychopathic mind works and how it can go awry.

Young Bostonian Robert Booth manages his entrance into the Florentine residence of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. When Robert Browning is summoned away from home by a messenger, Booth surreptitiously follows him, and it is thus, by horrible coincidence, that Booth is brought to the villa of his childhood sweetheart Isabel Eakin - who is now hanging by the neck from a tree in the garden...Subsequently the distinguished resident Robert Browning launches his own private investigation, aided and abetted by Robert Booth. Unfortunately, their amateur sleuthing is hampered by the fact that each of their suspects becomes the next victim in a series of murders orchestrated by a killer with a taste for poetic justice inspired by Dante's "Inferno". "A Rich Full Death" features characters both historical and imaginary, ranging from an enticing servant girl to Mr. Browning's consumptive, world-famous wife, Elizabeth Barrett, in a tale lush with period detail, intricately plotted, and with a truly astonishing final twist.

The two short novels in this book are Graham Greene's two Cold-War thrillers.In No Man's Land the main themes are security measures taken by the Russians against information on the uranium workings on the Czech-Austrian border and a kind of Teresa Neumann character who attracts religious pilgrims from outside the area. Actually Greene later changed that aspect of the story in favour of a visitation from the Virgin Mary herself, who appears, holding a rose, to two children, in an area that had recently come under the control of the Russian occupying forces in the Harz mountains. Greene wanted to exploit the recent uranium discoveries at Eisleben in the Soviet zone.In both stories the personal and political are entwined. Then Stranger'sHand features the plight of an eight-year boy, Roger Court, who is posted like a parcel by his aunt to a strange city, Venice, to meet a long-absent father who fails to turn up. Greene writes memorably about an alienated childhood and the rituals with which the boy seeks to distract himself, the improvised game of cricket, and the moments when his courage and self-control suddenly give way to helpless tears, are beautifully judged. Here again the background is Cold War espionage and intrigue so that the confrontation across the frontiers of disputed territory serves as a metaphor for moral and emotional disconnection.

Jules Beaurain used to wok for the Belgian police but since he was caught in a crossfire during a hijack at Athens airport, during which his wife was killed, he set up his own anti-terrorist unit called Telescope. Unfortunately since then he became the Stockholm Syndicate's target. One night Henderson and Beaurain together with 20 armed men were watching suspicious movements in a building in the rue des Bouchers when suddenly an assassin appeared out of nowhere with his Luger pointing at Beaurain. The latter could shoot at him with a gas pistol and then Henderson and his men neutralised him and took him away in their van.But then a series of questions had to be posed. Why did the Syndicate send a Russian called Serge Litov to do the killing? Was the dark-haired woman Beaurain had spotted in the window of the Auberge des Roses next to the scene of the shooting a watcher safely placed there by the Syndicate? Knowing that Beaurain had escaped the killing, what would the Syndicate's next step be? And how would Telescope counter their next attack? Or could it be that the Syndicate's plan was not to kill Beaurain but, far worse, to have Litov infiltrate Telescope and locate its main base at Chteau Wardin...?

In her touching tale, Mrs Lahiri tells the story of an Indian family living in the United States. The novel opens with the birth of Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli's son in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1968. Then the author relates in detail how Ashoke and Ashima marry in Calcutta without having met even once before. After the wedding, Ashoke is offered a position as a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering at MIT and moves to Cambridge, followed some time later by his wife Ashima. Since it is the tradition in Bengal that the grandmother determines her grandson's Christian name, she sends a letter from Calcuta to Cambridge but the letter never arrives and so the reader learns how the main character in the novel comes to bear the name of Gogol.It is interesting to see how the first generation emigrants feel completely out of place in their new environment, constantly longing to return to their country. But as their children grow up, they gradually adapt to American customs, startled by the fact that their offspring feel much closer to the culture they are being brought up in rather that to their parents' original civilisation. After Ashoke's death, more than thirty years later, as Ashima is about to sell her house and return to Calcutta, her conception of "home" has naturally shifted and she actually feels like going to a foreign place.A moving first novel in which Mrs Lahiri describes in a compassionate, tender and human way a small family making the voyage between Asia and America.

Peter Proctor, a retired Member of Parliament, is attempting to write his memoirs but he is constantly plagued by what is known to be the &quot;writer's block&quot;. Very soon, Peter realises that his block is due to the fact that his mind is constantly distracted by what happened thirty years before when he was active with the Foreign Office. At that time, he used to work together with a young aristocrat called Timothy Wycliffe. Tim lived in an elegantly furnished apartment in Belgravia until he was savagely murdered by a person or persons unknown. Thirty years later, Peter can't accept that Timothy was allegedly beaten to death by one of his boyfriends. And so begins a fast-paced enquiry, as Peter tries to unveil the truth that lies behind this mysterious murder.Mr Barnard's novel, beside being a witty and extremely well constructed mystery, gives the reader a fascinating view of British society in the 1950s and its changing as well as unchanging moves since.

In his study, Dr Storr investigates the urge which drives artists to produce works of art. Interestingly enough, an author like George Simenon stated that "Writing is not a profession but a vocation of unhappiness." For some artists, creating is a wish-fulfilment like for Frederik Rolfe who was a psychopathic personality and a paranoid and who was also querulous, egocentric, suspicious and misanthropic. Or James Bond, the character who was a wish-fulfilling fantasy of what Ian Flemming would like to have been. The desire for fame and honour is also a part of an artist's motivation. Some artists attach such enormous importance to their work that it can be considered as an addiction in which the creative activity is sometimes used as a defence. Many artists show a schizoid character: they are introverted, solitary people, preoccupied with inner rather than outer reality because they feel weak and vulnerable vis-&agrave;-vis others. Dr Storr mentions Franz Kafka, Charles Dickens, Bertrand Russel and Albert Einstein. Indeed, it is the capacity for extreme abstraction combined with a retention of contact with reality which makes creative achievement of a high order so remarkable. Had Isaac Newton not been anxious, insecure, hypochondriacal and self-disparaging with paranoid tendencies making him live in near total seclusion, he may never have achieved what he did.Some artists have a manic-depressive temperament and the opportunity to express themselves through art enables them to do so without the immediate need to fit in with the opinions of others. The artistic creation is thus an effective method of protecting the self from depression.Other artists like Rossini, Stravinski or Henrik Ibsen were obsessional characters - disgusted with bodily functions, parsimonious and miserly - so that their creative work was characterised by meticulous and extreme tidiness which reflects their compulsive need to order and control. Detachment from the object - "physical distance" - is a necessary condition for both artists and scientists and the capacity for abstraction gives the artist a sense of mastery over that from which he detaches himself.The fact that man carries with him throughout his life a discontent of the intrinsic frustration of his infancy leaves him with a "divine discontent" which may spur him on to creative achievement. The creative, especially those with a depressive psychopathology, readily identify themselves with others and they are very fearful of undue influence so that it is their very sensitivity to what others think which makes them avoid company.Furthermore, Dr Storr examines the relationship between genius and madness, that between creativity and the quest for identity and finally the creation as an act of integration. A very erudite work and yet very pleasantly written so that it is perfectly accessible even to the layman in psychology.

Mr Critser starts his study by explaining that palm oil was introduced in the US in the 1970s, cheaper and tastier than vegetable oil but containing 45 % saturated fat. At the same time, soft drink companies switched to high-fructose syrup saving the companies 20 % in sweetener costs and allowing the production of calorie-dense convenience food, the so-called "TV dinners". Still at the same time, meat production soared world-wide as feed costs of soy meal and corn fell. And so at fast food stands, portions became bigger and cheaper. "Value meals" became popular and the presence of more food for the same amount of money induced people to eat more. By the end of the 20th century, supersizing reigned in the fast food world. Another factor responsible for the rise of obesity is the habit of consuming high-calorie snacks between meals, particularly in schools where most cafeterias stopped cooking proper meals anyway in the favour of "outsourcing" - contracting an outside source to deliver pre-plated meals. The author then shows how obesity is associated with high levels of religiosity and how obesity is made to a cult on TV with some popular singers revering their own overweight body in their lyrics.Other factors contribute to obesity: lack of physical education in schools, disproportionate TV-viewing (where up to 40% of children advertising is for high-fat foods) which can lead children to develop type 2 diabetes, particularly among the working poor who have the "impulse to eat for today, tomorrow being a tentative proposition at best". Poverty, class and income are thus the key determinants of obesity. A report from the RAND/University of Chicago states that "The economic and personal health costs of overweight and obesity are enormous and compromise the health of the United States."Finally, in the last chapter the author suggests a series of measures to improve the current situation. An altogether well-researched and valuable study which tackles various issues: social, medical, economic, educational, cultural and culinary.

Hector Hugh Munro, alias "Saki", exposes with sharp wit all the absurdities and hypocrisies found in the country houses and clubs of the upper classes in the 1910s. Some stories are witty, others macabre and acid because the author drives a knife into the upper crust of the English Edwardian society. And the characters of the self-possessed Clovis or the vain and stylish Reginald are simply unforgettable.

Norman Malcolm was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein's. They exchanged many letters and the reader can discover the 56 letters that Wittgenstein sent to Malcolm between March 26 1940 to April 16 1951 in this book.Norman Malcolm does not discuss Wittgenstein's philosophical works - although he attended a respectable number of his lectures - but describes the philosopher in his daily life, his tastes, his talks with his fellows in Cambridge. It is interesting to learn that Wittgenstein was an emphatic talker both while lecturing and conversing privately, that he dressed as simply as possible although he had rigorous standards of cleanliness and that his room at Trinity College was austerely furnished.His lectures were quite original. He didn't address his audience in a formal way but the meetings - in his room where the members of the class had to bring chairs - were rather a conversation during which Wittgenstein carried on original research. He was usually impatient and easily angered and his students often feared him. Making friendship with Wittgenstein was very exacting since his extreme harshness could rebuke a friend. Malcolm often experienced that Wittgenstein had a tendency to be suspicious of motives and character. It was always a strain to be with Wittgenstein because of the intellectual demands of his conversation and his ruthless severity. This was due to his passionate love of truth and that is the reason why his philosophical thoughts tortured and exhausted him. He detested academic life, he could not stand the society of his academic colleagues and could not suffer all forms of affectation and insincerity. His mood was often sombre because of the difficulty of achieving understanding in philosophy. As he struggled to work through a problem, his listeners felt that they were in the presence of real suffering. That may explain his strong inclination to pessimism, a feeling that was often close to despair. Another source of torment was that he felt himself to be a failure as a teacher, a profession he abandoned after a few years to devote himself exclusively to philosophy.Towards the end of his life, Wittgenstein spent long months with Malcolm and his wife in America where Malcolm could witness Wittgenstein's increasing difficulty to concentrate and think, mainly because of his fragile health. A moving memory of one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century.

Anita Desai's wonderful novel tells the story of a family living in the small fishing village of Thul, 14 kilometres from Bombay, India. It is more precisely the story of two young people, Hari, a boy of 14, and Lila, a girl of 13, with a will to survive. Their task is not easy. Lila has to look after their mother who is very ill with fever and requires constant care. She is also in charge of all the household chores and has to look after their two younger sisters, Bela and Kamal. Hari on the other hand has to work in the fields, selling whatever he can at the market to feed the family. Indeed, their father has long ceased to be a fisherman, his sole occupation being to get drunk on toddy every night along with his chums in the village.Fortunately, next to their hut is a large country house called Mon Repos which is owned by the de Silvas from Bombay and whenever they come on holiday to Thul, Lila and Hari can earn some extra money by helping with the household or doing work in the garden. But there is a rumour in the village saying that soon the rice fields and the coconut groves will be replaced by a large fertiliser factory. The location of Thul was chosen by the Government for its closeness to the port of Rewas. So new highways and railway lines are to be build and the villagers are worried about their future. Are they skilled enough to get a job at the factory? What will become of their traditional way of life? Will the air and the sea be polluted by chemicals? When a delegation is sent to Bombay to express their worries to the Minister Sahib, Hari decides to join the party. Before leaving, he decides that Bombay may offer him a better life opportunity than his frightened sisters, his sad house, his ill mother and his drunken father. And it is indeed in Bombay where this delicate boy, who

George Mecklin is a teacher of English in New York. He is married to Emma, they're both in their early thirties and they live in the country, a small place called Harmon. George has got an unemployed and divorced sister, Lila. Claude is her young son. George goes to work, attends staff meetings, spends his evenings with Emma, worries about money...It is precisely this uneventful way of life that makes Mrs Fox's novel interesting. It is the tedious and habitual way George leads his life, the utter emptiness and uselessness of his daily activities, almost as though he were living against his own volition. An "attitude of defeat" is a description used for Emma but it may equally adequately be applied to George, an attitude also shown by his clothes which hang on their hangers "like humble effigies of himself". Even his trying to help a lost youth, Ernest Jenkins, fails because George, "the goddamned fool", can only offer him dead heroes and dead poets. But George is lucid enough to be aware that he suffers from a profound disaffection with his life. "Poor George! I guess you have as many troubles as the rest of us" says one of the characters. Indeed, it is a novel about all the troubles one has to cope with in one's dreary everyday existence, masterfully put down on paper by Mrs Fox.

There are 17 charming, funny and frequently puzzling short stories in "The Elephant Vanishes". Nearly all bear the author's particular style: a mixture of magical realism, feckless wandering and clean writing, often ending at a blank wall.The 17 stories, very well translated by Alfred Birnbaum and Jay Rubin, show the author's wide range of reading and interests. The stories are set in Japan but they include references to Allen Ginsberg, Clarence Darrow, Candice Bergen, the "Colonel Bogey" March, Meryl Streep, W. Harper, Robert De Niro, "Anna Karenina," Sly and the Family Stone, Dustin Hoffman, and Katherine Mansfield.A nice collection of stories which will charm all readers fond of the author's particular literary style.

The first volume in Mr Mahfouz's trilogy - Bayn al-quasrayn is its original title in Arabic - is set in Cairo a few months before the beginning of the revolution that ultimately lead to the independence of Egypt from the British Rule on April 7, 1919 (incidentally the year Mr Mahfouz was born). This magnificent tale tells the story of the Abd al-Jawad family who live in Palace Walk. Ahmed Abd al-Jawad and his wife Amina have two daughters, Khadija and Aisha, and three sons: Yasin is a secretary at al-Nashin school and the son of his father's previous marriage to Haniya, Fahmy is a law student and Kamal, a 10 year old boy.As the reader follows the joys, sorrows and temptations of each member of the Abd al-Jawad family, he discovers what life used to be like in Cairo at the beginning of the last century. Mr Mahfouz's prose is full of psychological insight, both cultural and social observations and the tale is told with great affection, humour and sensitivity. It is also worth praising William Maynard Hutchinsons's achievement as a translator in this edition.

In the second volume of "The Cairo Trilogy", we follow the progress of Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad's family after the death of Fahmy in a riot against the British. After more than one year, Al-Sayyid Ahmad resumes his visits to Jalila and Zubayda. The later is to become his private mistress on a houseboat on the Nile and later Yasin's wife! Kamal is now seventeen and to Al-Sayyid Ahmad's disappointment he intends to enrol at the Teachers College. His father would wish him to become a civil servant or an engineer but Kamal is more interested in literature and philosophy. He is indeed becoming an adult and his relation with his mother Amina is changing. He feels that he has nothing much to tell her except "meaningless chatter". Another disappointment for Kamal is his love for Ada who never quite reciprocates his feelings for her.What makes the second volume interesting is the evolution of the Egyptian society, the rules of which begin to relax as the country inexorably adopts more Western values. These values are difficult to accept for conservative people like those of Al-Sayyid Ahmad's generation. It appears that the family values suffer most from such a modernisation and in this respect Yasin is a good example with his three marriages. Like in the first volume, the reader can expect the highest literary standards in "Palace Of Desire" by one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.

Il lui semble que vingt ans de sa vie sont d'un coup abolies, qu'il revient au point de d&eacute;part, comme si Ambrose Guise n'existait plus dans la poussi&egrave;re et la chaleur de Paris.

Pourquoi lui promet-il que les gens qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; t&eacute;moins de ses d&eacute;buts dans la vie vont peu &agrave; peu disparatre? Et pourquoi Daniel de Rocroy s'est-il donn&eacute; la mort il y a cinq ans &agrave; son domicile?Un des meilleurs livres de Patrick Modiano, avec peut-tre un peu plus d'action et d'intrigue que dans ses autres romans.

Has the book you're holding really been written by the author mentioned on the cover? We readers rarely ask ourselves this question but in Mr Calvino's novel, even this simple assumption is questioned. The story is quite confusing indeed because nothing is as it appears.But apart from the plot, Mr Calvino reflects on interesting topics which in my view save the book. For instance the reader's dilemma of choosing the appropriate novel among the thousand existing publications, the required ingredients to create suspense in a plot, the fact that books are easily defined entities which can be enjoyed without risks compared to the elusive quality of real-life existence, the pleasure of using a paper knife as the reader cuts his way through a novel or the problem posed by someone reading a text which may impose an undesirable pace on the listener. The author also casts a critical glance at universities as literary institutions which have forgotten that literature can be enjoyed in a natural, innocent and primitive way without having to be lacerated by intellectual analysis.

Martin Redford is an unemployed and divorced ex-schoolteacher of foundered promise and dismal prospect. So when Alec Fowler suggests that Martin comes to visit him on the island of Madeira with the promise of a prospective job offered by his South African friend Leo Sellick, he eagerly accepts.It turns out that when Sellick became the owner of his house, the Quinta do Porto Novo, he came across a manuscript written by its previous owner, Edwin Strafford. Strafford had been appointed Home Secretary in 1908 at the age of thirty-two. Why did he resign two years later without explanation before becoming British Consul on Madeira? Why was he abruptly rejected by his fianc&eacute;e, suffragette Elizabeth Latimer? Who or what betrayed Edwin Strafford in 1910? It is going to be a twisty path for Martin Redford, now Leo Sellick's employee, to find the answers to these questions and many others.A good plot and a sound historical background are the qualities of this entertaining adventure story. Paul Shelley is the excellent reader of this novel for BBC Audiobooks.

In Mrs Fossum's psychological thriller, the main character is a schizophrenic man of 24 called Errki Johrma. He has narrow shoulders and surprisingly wide hips and because he inherited bad hip joints, he moves about with a hideous swing as if he wants to shake off something on his back. His skin is scarred with acne, his eyes deep-set and strange, often downcast, avoiding other people's glance. He wears filthy, smelly and disgusting clothes and the words on his T-shirt read "Kill The Others".He sees the world through a sort of murky veil, always afraid that others are after him, that every single person is his enemy and that is why he has no friends at all and hardly talks to anyone. He often conducts imaginary inner dialogues with a hallucinatory figure called "Nestor". Most people find him so repulsive that they compare him with an animal, finding that his eyes resemble those of a dog or that he runs like a hare.One day, a boy called Kannick Snellingen finds the dead body of Haldis Horn lying on the steps of her small farm in Finnemarka. He also reports to the police that he has seen Errki Johrma in the woods not far from the farm. And indeed Inspector Sejer soon finds out that Errki has been missing from the asylum for some time...Mrs Fossum designed a clever plot in this mystery story and her portrayal of the schizophrenic mind will indeed regale readers interested in psychology in the same manner as Ruth Rendell's books do.

Max Raphael becomes the deputy superintendent of a provincial hospital for the criminally insane in 1959. He has been appointed by superintendent Jack Straffen and is going to work together with psychiatrists John Archer and Peter Cleave, the latter being the narrator of the ensuing events. Max is accompanied by his wife Stella and his son Charlie.But soon Stella comes to despise the claustrophobic atmosphere of the mental institution and her husband Max - it was a cold and white marriage - who has a weak sexual drive and lacks the moral and physical imagination to continue to find Stella attractive and who channels his libido into his work.It is therefore understandable that after meeting one of Peter's patients, a sculptor called Edgar Stark, she feel irresistibly attracted by his strong manliness.But Edgar is a delusional patient who killed his wife Ruth, then cut her head and mutilated her. This was the result of an unconscious process and the product of the delusional structure of his mind to suppose his wife's infidelity. Edgar structured his sculpting around Ruth until the idealisation of her person collapsed and he developed morbid delusions about her infidelity.One day Edgar manages to steal some of Max's clothes and absconds to London. When Peter notices that Stella has secretly visited Edgar several times in London, he tries to warn her about the dangers such a situation is bound to present, but to no avail. Stella decides to join Edgar and flees her family thus placing her life into the hands of a dangerous criminal.The narrative structure of the novel is particularly original since it combines both events which unfold chronologically and a retrospective account or confession to Peter of Stella's relationship with Edgar. The narrative is superb and unruffled and the slowly shocking descent into the tormented depths of madness is a brilliant achievement. Few authors have shown with such elegance and restraint the extremes of mental derangement.

Richard Watt and Magda Carson, both British, have been peacefully living on their farm, La Vigna di Giobbe, in Tuscany, for several years. Though their life appears to be idyllic given the setting and the climate, they both have to work hard growing vegetables and fruit, producing wine and olive oil in order to make both ends meet. But why did Richard decide to leave his fatherland and emigrate to Italy? The reason for this matter may seem slightly utopian at first glance but Mr Cook manages to describe the situation so masterfully that it is utterly believable - even more so, considering what we know today about the former East-European countries. Indeed, Richard used to be a journalist at the time when a certain Jobling was Prime Minister. Richard was made redundant when he predicted that Jobling, for fear of being thrown out at the next election, would simply announce that he was going to rule by himself. And indeed, it turned out that there was practically nothing to stop him, making Richard's prediction true. After a particularly vitriolic TV interview, Jobling won the election just the same and Richard was put on a blacklist so that he couldn't afford to live in Britain anymore. But Jobling isn't about to forget Richard Watt and he finds out means to extradite him. For Richard, being forced to return to Britain, now a crumbling and decaying totalitarian state, will prove, as you may guess, to be fatal.A harrowing and powerful account,

In a small Italian village, shortly after World War II, three Americans converge. One is a Southern lawyer, the other is a rough-edged artist with a strong penchant for alcohol and the third one is a delightful aristocrat who is the closest thing possible to wickedness. Out of this reunion, William Styron has crafted a fabulous novel of rape, murder, suicide and deception with an insight of the dreadful persuasiveness of evil. The qualities of this novel are many, ranging from the sense of the striking scene, the fine art of the dialogue, the sharp depiction of cities, Italian scenery and interiors. William Styron is certainly one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. This is my favourite book by this author.

An old magistrate waiting to retire is serving out his last days on a lazy frontier in South Africa. He has jurisdiction over the garrison. But with the arrival of Colonel Joll from the Third Bureau - the most important division of the Civil Guard - the peaceful life is about to end for the magistrate. The arrival of Joll and his troops is justified by the fact that in the capital there is some concern about the barbarian tribes of the north uniting with those of the west, which may lead to unrest. Joll's methods of interrogation are brutal, his evidence against the native prisoners based on thin air. "Prisoners are prisoners" is enough of an accusation to lead a man or a woman to death.When the magistrate decides to take a twenty year old girl with whom he had a relationship back to her tribe of barbarians, he is accused of having treasonously conspired with the enemy and the treatment inflicted on him thereafter is no less inhuman than that endured by the barbarians themselves. This is the price the magistrate has to pay for giving up his "alliance with the guardians of the Empire" and setting himself into opposition, thus becoming an enemy of the state.Mr Coetzee's book shows all the suffering that the apartheid regime used to inflict on native South Africans. Furthermore, it shows that this regime was capable of committing the same atrocities against people of their own kin.

Murakami's novel follows the fate of two unconventional characters. The first is called Kafka Tamura. He undertakes to run away from home on his fifteenth birthday, travel to a remote place and spend some time living in a library. His project turns out to be successful and so he finds himself at the Komura Library in Takamatsu where he meets Oshima and the enigmatic Miss Saeki.The other character is an older man called Nakata, a master cat-finder who is able to converse with cats although he can neither read nor write.Both Kafka and Nakata find their way to Takamatsu although they never meet. During their wanderings they meet all kinds of characters, some of them have a surrealistic nature. Indeed quite a few scenes have a dream-like quality because they are not rational. It is as if the reader were reading a sort of stream-of-consciousness but its form is fully structured unlike similar passages found in James Joyce or Virginia Wolf. It is a tale of quest which is highly inventive with cats conversing with people, fish raining from the sky and soldiers rambling in a forest, un-aged since the second World War... The superb reading for Naxos Audiobooks is done by Sean Barrett and Oliver Le Sueur. A fantastic performance.

Mr Battles's "Library" is not a study for scholars but for general readers who will be charmed by its old-fashioned character, by the elegant prose of its sentences and paragraphs and by its human portrait of libraries. The recording and transmission of knowledge from generation to generation is one of the greatest achievements of mankind and libraries play a crucial role in this process. And it is certainly disquieting to learn about the destruction of millions of books by the Nazis in the Louvain library or the siege of the Boston National and University Library but then Mr Battles reassures the reader by focussing on the building of outstanding collections and on the central role of libraries in every society. Who would have thought that the books in the infamous "model Jewish city" at the Theresienstadt concentration camp during the Final Solution "cast the ghetto reader into bibliopsychological relief"?An excellent study which will delight all those who appreciate books. And the next time we enter a library, we should keep in mind that "readers read books; librarians read readers"!

In May 1944 the Gestapo Colonel, Alfred Brunnerman, begins his interrogation of a French Resistance agent, Terese Masson. If he cannot break her down by "subtle" means, she will be delivered to the sadists in the German torture headquarters in Paris. Both Brunnerman and Terese are young, in different circumstances they could have been attracted to each other. Throughout the hours of their interview that possibility becomes so evident that it almost leads to the corruption of Brunnerman and the destruction of the girl...So begins the chilling story of an escaped Nazi war criminal, living as a successful architect under a false name and nationality in New York society. His past is buried for good - or so he thinks - and he moves at ease among the rich and famous. Then, at a fashionable cocktail party, Brunnerman suddenly comes face to face with the woman he sent to the torture chamber twenty years ago. And he experiences a violent reawakening of the passion he had once used to try and save Terese Masson.In this recording, the story is read in a superb way by British comedian Pavel Douglas who manages to perform a wide variety of accents - American, French and German. A delight to listen to.
