Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle B&eacute;art was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cin&eacute;ma francais. Deneuve, B&eacute;art, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in.What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good!Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add.

Depeche Mode hit the big time here. If any album made Americans and any non-believers believe in them, this is the one. It has all the typical DM features that you would expect in a DM album. It may not be one of my favourites ( CTA, BC and Ultra and Violator get that honour ) but make no mistake it's not far away from them.If you are thinking about buying this you should do so now

At first I kinda liked the album although it wasn't much to listen to . After a few more listens it just fell apart . Added to this was that the feeling you had heard all the songs before and by now it had really begun to grate on your nerves . It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ). If like Eminem ( which I also don't like but I think he's got a point with Moby ) then just don't listen to this . If you are looking for some really nice ambient dance music may I suggest The Orb or Boards Of Canada . They make music with a lot more imagination than you'll hear from this pile of waste

That scene alone will haunt many men if they choose to view it. It's done so disarmingly that you just stare in disbelief at what has just happened. Definitely the most memorable scene in the film.As you will have gathered, this infamous film was banned by UK ( under the Video Nasties Act ) and Germany as well. It involves the story of an aspiring novelist Jennifer ( Camille Keaton ) who escapes the hustle and bustle of New York to try to finish her novel. All looks so peaceful and tranquil that you don't really expect anything to happen. But then things take a turn for the worse as Jennifer is gang raped not once, not twice but THREE times. It's awful to see this happen to anyone. The fact that she tries to crawl to her bedroom to phone the police only for her attackers to come back again and inflict more damage is just terrible.Having said that you can really see the limitations of the actual " rape " scenes. They use some scenes again and again that you can easily catch out and it sometimes takes a little sting out of the actual scene. Don't get me wrong, the way the guys just won't let her go and get one of them to kill her is awful but you can see the limitations the director had in trying to film the scenes.Jennifer somehow manages to survive these attacks which seems like a miracle given that she was spared being stabbed by the village idiot. Eventually he gets found out that he didn't stab her and is beaten up for not finishing off the job.Later on she decides that the only course of action she can take is revenge. Some women might enjoy this aspect while others may feel that she's stooping to their level. Whatever your view, this part of the movie is where it really kicks into gear. First off the list is the village idiot and then the ringleader who, as I mentioned in first paragraph, suffers the most awful death of the lot. And then the final two sidekicks get knocked off as well.I suppose this film can be viewed as a feminist statement of revenge being a dish best served cold. The film certainly works despite the limitations of budget and the cut-back scenes between the gang-rapists. That being the only real fault of this film. The acting is pretty good for a horror movie. Camille Keaton portrays her role convincingly during the aftermath of the rape scene and the film in general.This film is really hard to recommend. Most people will be disgusted that " this piece of trash ever existed " but for anyone who likes to watch a movie that has gained infamy and notoriety due to being a " Video Nasty " in Britain....then this is the movie for them. But even then I don't know if they'd want to watch this

Ah Arab Strap, given the title of miserable (...)from Scotland but that rather misses the point. They've lyrics that are very dry and cutting which can make you laugh out loud. And on this album they seem to sound a little happier ( Come Round and Love Me, Dream Sequence ) although it does have some sad moments ( Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003 ). But in general it sounds a lot more brighter, chirpier as if they've got a new spring in their step from a new relationship. And even on the topical There Is No Ending you still feel that while the world may be a big pile of (...) outside, everything else is alright. Which in a funny way is quite comforting and reassuring. If you can take Aidan Moffat's voyeurist-love-detective style of singing ( never short of an innuendo somewhere ) then this album is for you. Enjoy

This movie is truly magnificent. The visuals here are truly something else. I wouldn't be too sure about what sort of interpretation I should give because the movie is very open ended and hence you are left to make your own take on what this is about. Some will like it, some will not. I found it a very gripping story of sorts. There is a story to it but the thing becomes fractured midway through and from then on you have to make your own way through this movie. It does question the impact of friendships and the deceit and betrayal that can come from them. It's all very real in a sense and then it's not. It is that which questions our own take on reality. In a way I suppose it is a very existential movie. Though by no means should you take my word for granted. See the movie for yourself, take from the film what you can ( if there's anything there for you ).

The basic idea of this is that Arnold Masters is sent to a mental hospital for committing a crime he thinks he didn't commit and befriends a black man who not only believes him but gives him his black magic set after he dies. He is set free from the hospital after some bizarre happenings and comes home to find life in the old house has become dilapidated and filled with cobwebs. Being on his own since his mother passed away, he reads the old letters he sent to his mother and sees that they were partially censored which he finds deeply upsetting. He venges to make the people who done him wrong pay. And he makes sure he does that by using the black magic set he was given. One by one the victims are killed and the police are clueless to who it is until the missing pieces suddenly fall into place.While the acting may be a bit ropey occasionally, the film plays out extremely well and occasionally has a few blackly comical scenes in the mix to ease the viewer somewhat. The tension though is created well and altogether the film is compelling viewing. Some scenes such as The Nurse's Death will provide enough amusement for all and the operatic property expert might possibly raise a chuckle or two. Sure there are shades of Psycho and possibly The Wicker Man about it ( but the last reference is only somewhat brief ) but the film can easily hold itself on it's own. Ultimately it is a really enjoyable movie but one that is utterly bleak in it's outlook on revenge and loss and the sad ending to this only makes it all the more so.

This is XTC's first album and it contains the band at their most nervy and manic. The band obviously had a lot of energy to burn and it shows through on this album. This is the first album I've purchased of theirs and it's so infectious that you can't put this album down. I'm Bugged is an obvious highlight as well as The Statue Of Liberty which would have got airplay only if the BBC didn't pick up on the &quot; I sail the winds beneath your skirt &quot; line. Which is unfortunate really as it really deserved more. It's unfortunate this band didn't do better but then.....that's what happens in life!

This film has gained notoriety and infamy due to it being banned in Britain under the Video Nasties Act. For someone like me, that kinda serves as a catalyst into seeing why these films were banned in the first place ( as well as being a bit of a gore hound as well ). For me though, this is/was the ultimate video nasty in that before I had read so much about this film that I wanted to see it at all costs. In the end I got it cheaply on DVD which I'm pretty happy about.This film tells the story of Reno ( Jimmy Laine AKA Abel Ferrara ), a struggling artist who slowly goes insane trying to finish his masterpiece while a crap punk band called The Roosters move in and disrupt his space. It's all very realistic as it shows the run-down surroundings that Reno lives under where he regularly sees violence of one sort of another. All this plays on his psyche and gradually he succumbs to violence.Obviously you know what happens next after he purchases a battery operated powertool so I'll leave you to watch the rest of the carnage from there on. In a sense I'll let you be your own judge on this film because it's not for everyone and I certainly can't judge whether some people would want to watch it. Certainly though, it should be viewed for the amount of notoriety it has picked up if nothing else. The only problem for some is that it does have some arthouse pretensions which may or may not be a bad thing. It's up to you to decide which.

What an album. What a sound. The album title is definitely a good description for what the album sounds like. And what it feels like. It's totally alien. It's.....quite frankly beyond words. No amount of words is ever going to give you an idea of how the music should sound and if there were then they would totally destroy the whole ethos and the whole mystique around the music. It's just something you need to experience.....absolutely no words can do this album justice at all.

Arguably this is The Orb's finest album to date. Yes it is their first album but that's besides the point. The music here is beautifully aimless and although that may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is however beautiful to listen to when you are feeling stressed out from everyday hassles.I remember getting a loan of this album by accident. I had asked for a loan of an OrbITAL album but instead I got this. Admittedly I was 10 years of age at the time and I didn't know what to make of the album but it instantly mesmerizing quality that it had back then. I thought at the time that it was too much but there were a couple of songs in there that I thought were quite special ( Little Fluffy Clouds, Perpetual Dawn )Fast forward a few years and my auntie got me the UFOff compilation and I thought that was brilliant and for years even though I would be listening to heavy metal bands there was a still a place in my heart for that albumThe next step I took was buying UFOrb and that was really amazing almost timeless. And I literally mean timeless in the sense that you were utterly lost in space listening to that albumI went to see them at The Ambassador in Dublin in 2001 and they put on a great show.....it was really amazing to see them playing their songs and of course enjoying every second. They ended their set after 2 hours and if anybody disagreed they gave them the finger ( check your UFOff copies for the meaning! )Since I thought that the show was absolutely amazing I went out on an Orb album buying spree. I don't regret it at all. This was the first album I bought and it brought back that spacy feel that is synonymous when you buy their records ( and of course their odd sense of humour )What amazed me about this album was that I could grasp it all now but it still managed to be spacier than UFOrb and continues to be so. While UFOrb is a good album, it feels as though some of the tracks were a lot of lay offs from the first album.But that's a different argument altogether as some Orb fans prefer UFOrb to Ultraworld which is fine by me. Each and everyone to their own.....Anyway the point I was trying to make ( you can tell I'm a really big fan by recalling the sentiments this band has brought me ) is that this album is essential for those who like ambient music or for those who just want some music to relax to after a rough, tough and very brutal week at work. Buy now and you won't regret it

This album starts off in a usual Yello fashion ( although at that time it wasn't really known ) which is bright and breezy yet still a little quirky but then right about in the middle of the album things begin to get a little weird. The moody instrumentals give a sense of unease and by the time Assistant's Cry comes it completely knocks itself over with Dieter Meier sounding a bit like he's got a few screws loose somewhere and then oddly reverts back to how it was originally but somehow nothing feels the same - you're somehow waiting for the next creep out which never comes. They never quite did this again.....

This is a book that studies the human mind when in a deserted place with no one to help them. An interesting book at the start but it loses steam and never seems to take the next step. It's just centred on the isolation of the three people and the green brain's analysis of these people that try to survive. Strange I'll give it that but it just didn't have enough as it just never got out of second gear to help it along it's way

What more can I say about this album. It's not quite as agressive as their later material but it is quite effective. Although softer it doesn't make it anymore stranger. This sounds as surreal as possible with Centre Bullet being the most filmic of songs - perhaps even angelic ( if such a word could be used ). It's true that there are more instrumentals on this album than on any other but that can also give it its charm.At least give it a try - you never know what you might think

I tip my hat towards the company execs who thought this was a good idea. It really was but they could have easily added on the other two singles from 1968 and that would have practically rounded up the singles since Pink Floyd weren't going to make another single until &quot; they built the wall &quot;As it is they're 6 brilliant songs that clock in at under 18 minutes. Just can't help but feel you need another 12 more minutes just to feel anyway satisfied. Still it is a nice memento in memory of Syd of the talent he had for writing rather odd pop tunes. Hats off to him

These tracks are really beautiful and I'm glad I managed to get a copy of this. The only thing I will say is that listening to this is like being sucked into a timewarp because the music is trance inducing at least and for when time literally goes out the window and comes back when the CD is finished. And while DM fans can count the amount of times you hear snippets of the band......it doesn't feel like it's them.....it seems to flow effortlessly and seamlessly into the mixSeriously recommended

David Lynch and commercial films don't usually go together. However there are some exceptions ( Blue Velvet ) but this was one of those flops. It's hard not to see why. Dune is such a huge book to cover that it would take 8 hours to film ( as Lynch once said ) and naturally film goers didn't get it. I've watched it and I have to admit, I was close to calling this a [weak] movie because it was so tedious and preposterous but I gave it time and it came around just in the nick of time ( the last 30 minutes ) but having watched it a few times more it does tend to grow on you and is a surprisingly good filmNew Lynch fans should probably start at Mullholland Drive - start from his latest and work their way down.

While Geography is perhaps a little too syrupy, this is the real deal in comparison. The beats are more militant, the synths sound colder and at times the whole sound is much more harsher than Geography. There's not one track on this album I can fault but Special Forces is amazing. The chorus is really powerful - the synths sound like they're going all-out on a nuclear attack. S.FR.Nomenklatura is where it reaches it's most noisiest and abrasive. And Body to Body is an addictively fast catchy song that does beat the original for sheer energy. Perhaps this album may not be as technically good as Front To Front or Evil Off or whatever but the album is all heart and that's the way it should be sometimes

I won't go too much into this. The film is pretty self explanatory. This is probably one of the most depressing movies you'll probably. As teenagers I'm sure everyone has flirted with the idea of death and suicide at some point. Most of us generally pull out of it but for some - they don't. In fact this can be used as an alternative guide to what you might have done had you really gone to the point of no return. It's a very sobering experience. And I wouldn't have said this back then when I did flirt with the idea of suicide but......it actually does make you value your own life that little bit more. Some might question why you watch this....and to be honest I can't find an answer to that ( you probably have to have a morbid obsession ). Towards the end you begin to feel that some of the others are staged. Which happens with films like these ( Faces of Death ). Nevertheless they still have the power to shock but gradually the more you watch - the more you become numb to it. I suppose by exposing yourself to the dangers without actually doing any self harm to yourself you......I wouldn't say stronger but you become more aware of the things you would leave behindI don't recommend this to suicidal teenagers the world over because this may seem like they're been given alternative ways than to just slit their wrists but......I'd probably only recommend this to people who have watched Faces of Death at least once. Other than that I probably wouldn't recommend this too much - there's a limit to what some people can take. But in the last words of some that have committed suicide on this film " turn the camera off."

Released just before 30 and after Shot In The Dark and while Shot In The Dark was good you can hear the improvement in Garnier's production work. It's got the ability to make you dance your socks off. And of course as with most techno music there is - you'll hear a lot of orgasmic groans and such but that shouldn't really distract you from the music. Enjoy

Live albums are usually nothing more than cheap giveaways that you already have heard in their studio life and are usually much better. Everybody knows that you'll get the same tracks with the crowds cheering the performer on for more more MORE. So why should you buy this? Well the fact of the matter is that it's everything a usual live album is NOT. Yes that's right - this is NOT your usual live album. First of all many of the tracks here are new. Secondly the band are practically hated mainly because there isn't 12XU which eventually comes up in fractured form ( not a bad thing ). Their MC is the one that helps the fans get what they want because it's his &quot; request spot &quot; despite being called a fat.....well you know - can't say it here for obvious reasons. And in the mix there's a few snippets of conversations from an interview. And at the end there's two studio tracks which are OK but dilute the whole experience of the concert(s) completelyI guess it's one for the diehards but everyone should try this live album for the chaos within because if not you'll be missing out. Oh and you can't resist the bottle being thrown in the middle of a song with the reply &quot; Who's a clever boy then! &quot;

I don't understand why many Wire fans of phase 1 don't like this or are scared to venture into it because it has synths on it. Are some of these people really purists that the only good music can come from a guitar, bass, drums or whatnot? It's complete rubbish if they do think that and besides they may use synths but they're not too dominant in the mix. The lyrics are indecipherable but sound right next to the music and if anything, they do show a logical progression from 154/Document&Eyewitness. It's just that one word that'll scare off some people - synthesizers. Quite frankly, I can't see what's the problem with that - it sounds beautiful

Take the concept of TV commercials and how we define pop music as " commercial " and marry the two of them together. It's a very shrewd idea, even ballsy. Is it any good though? Surprisingly so. The songs or, since we're talking of The Commercial Album, commercials barely last a minute long, a near ideal length for a commercial. But if you want to take it in a pop context the songs are not long enough to guarantee memorability. But that is only on first listen. They can be extremely memorable. Like my father used to say " Short. Sharp. Concise. And to the point." This is what this album is. It displays some cutting ideas on love and life which can be thought provoking. Take Love Is for example, the lyrics to which are;"Love is only loneliness divided by anotherLove is only living for the lonelyLove is only loneliness divided by anotherAnd I know that life is lonely"Some may find that stupid but I think it's a pretty interesting thought and indeed it could be more truthful then anyone of us will care to admit.However, this album is worthwhile if you want to see these eyeballed men work at their most shrewdly inspired. Now I'd like to see how those video commercials worked on that DVD.......

Some healthy advice Zappa gives - Never eat yellow snow. That should be a lesson to anyone unless they want to be the next in a new wave of Jackass stunt daredevilsStill as for the album itself it is one big story that doesn't make sense but that doesn't really matter. The music is good and that's that. Apostrophe ( the track ) is one of the best instrumentals ever recorded on tape and for that this album must be bought.Enjoy

Alright let's get this straight - I am not a NIN fan. I used to be but after while Trent's whiney voice got a bit too much. Added to that his music gets rather samey after a lot of listening ( hell I used to listen to these albums as a sort of bible for teenage depression - now I wince at the thought of listening to these again )This however is a reasonable effort and the most hated of NIN CDs by fans because it sounds so 80s. Well it was made in 1989.True the album may have some weak lyrics but there's warmth to them. Which is essentially what you need when you consider we're kinda talking about a synth pop\electro industrial pop we have here. This ain't rock - it never was and it never will be.There are some nice touches with Ringfinger, That's What I Get and Something I Can Never Have. This is where that warmth comes into place.Overall this is Trent at his most vulnerable I suppose. This is something that might attract some female admirers more unless they are diehard rockers with a hatred for synthy music. But it's done well. It's not as innovative as people like to imagine. Come on people if you really think this is industrial there are some gaps in your knowledge of the genre. What he did wasn't revolutionary - that happened way back in 1976 with bands like Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle and later on Skinny Puppy and Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten and even MinistryBut I won't harbour on about my purism towards industrial music. Buy this if you are a fan of the band or interested in getting into NIN. If you want something harder, there's always something better - and it came from the late 70s onwards to mid 80s

This is a great CD but again you'll have to be patient with this CD . It's sounds more like Depeche Mode than what they would later do . But the songs do win you over in time except for GVDT which is immediate . You can't help but groove along to it and it's naive robotic charms . Recommended

This album is hilarious. It tells people not to be ashamed of living on Earth just because there are shootings because "it's like that everywhere". I know that this is a live album version of Big Sexy Land but it's [darn] near impossible to get an album of these guys here in Ireland so when I got it....I felt like a little kid in a candystore.The music is brilliant and well really there's not much else to say because the album is well and truly awesome. Interestingly this album has gone in Rolling Stones' Funniest Album Titles segment. Anyway enough rambling buy the album and there will be no disappointment

This is a fantastic CD with cool synth work and rather political...lyrical themes . The reason why I say this is a slow starter is that when you first buy it you may think some of it sounds dated and only a couple of tracks are worth the price of the CD . You may leave this CD for a couple of weeks and then come back to it and then suddenly it just starts to click with you and you begin to like it more .My favourite tracks on this are Me I Funk ( that extended synth riff is just too cool ), What Do You Know , Itchy Bitchy ( for complete pervs only ) and the last track , The Unrestrained Use Of Excessive Force . This is a rather strange song . It sounds really eerie and ends with a harsh drum crashing it's endIt's recommended but just don't expect it to hit you over the head and make you fall in love with it . It has to be dealt with subtlety

Yeah this is probably not one of Depeche Mode's greatest albums. Some of the songs are a bit patchy and the lyrics are definitely ropey but it has something that some people tend to forget in albums - charm! It's thoroughly modest and they're not trying to be anything other than themselves. True, the cover of this album does gives a mysterious edge to it - and certainly for a pop band it does seem markedly different from anything else. But Monument, My Secret Garden, Leave In Silence and even Sattelite have something about them that seem oddly addictive.It may never reach the greats but sometimes the greats are a little too pretentious and we need something that's real - that has flaws - that's human! It's those sort of things that make this album have a rare charm despite some of it's failings

This is where Ministry begin their ongoing fascination with metal ( with upgrades coming in the form of RevCo ) and where most people start when they think of Ministry. Picking favourites is impossible for me even though I rarely listen to this - it's more to do with the aggression of the tracks which do it for me but needless to say the first 3 tracks are the best with some of the heavier electronic songs rivalling them too ( Hizbollah and You Know What You Are in particular ).

Surely every Skinny Puppy release now will be met with scepticism in some quarters as it's not the real Skinny Puppy....that there is a missing dynamic element or something of that element and they have a point. Nothing is going to replace Dwayne.....just think if they tried to replace them. There might have been a mini outrage.True this may not be the Skinny Puppy of old. In truth I feel it sounds a bit like some of Cevin's Download material. Yet I still feel that it sounds good. And that's the main thing, that the music sounds good. This is the Skinny Puppy of today. It might not be acceptable to some and they're perfectly right in their ways.As it stands I think it's a perfectly fine album with plenty to offer and it's accessible....it might not be the noise sculptures of old but you know, it gets boring like that.

Admittedly this is no Yoshima but it is a more out of control approach and it might sound all over the place at times but it is sure to have some sort of satisfaction for listeners

The Killers are another one of these retro-revivalists who've made it big. They're here honing in on those who've always had a soft spot for new wave hits. Who have enjoyed The Cure and Depeche Mode, who like their songs a little darker but still upbeat. Are they any good? Not exactly but they do show signs of promise. Somebody Told Me is not bad as a song as it has the androgynous tongue-twister chorus that is an update of Blur's Girls And Boys. The rest however is a little sub-standard really. Tossed off in a rush and sounding a bit like the also-rans of Britpop ten years ago. The music is nothing exciting though. As with most retro-revival acts, it treads on thin ice. It's only a matter of time before it cracks and then we'll see whether they sink or swim.

Who cares about the 3 versions of Sin - you can hear the song on the album. Having said that I quite like the Queen cover Get Down Make Love mainly for the production values of Al Jourgensen ( yes he's Hypo Luxa ). It's still interesting and although Trent's vocals almost ruin the song - the song is saved due to Al's top production skills ( something Trent could use a hand with )

This is a startling CD. For the most part, this is the definition of machine music. Sounds like loops of compactors/crushers and going on with minimal yet audible ( after a few listens ) signs of any other more synthetic sounds are heard. But inbetween these are the sounds of what I think is Middle Eastern instrumentation which is really beautiful.....it gives this album an exotic touch. On first listen, this is a exhausting listen. It almost has a dehumanizing aspect. But with a few more listens there's some slight cases of something, if not more accessible, then clearly more audible to enhance a mood. If you enjoy the more experimental stuff, this is the record for you

Enjoyably fun German New Wave music ( or Neue Deutsche Welle ). I only heard of this band thanks to Markus Kavka of MTV Germany when he was presenting greatest hits of the past 20 years ( singling in on one year though ) and I heard this song which I loved so much I went out and saw if I could get it. I did and it was an enjoyable record that I wish I could find more of their recordsIf you like bands like Devo you'll have no problem with this

This is the paranoid reaction of Roger Waters' given that the Conservatives ( Tories ) came to power. And to many listeners you'll get the same feeling but I'll get to that later.On first listen, Animals is so disappointing. What once was beautiful now sounds so ugly! Dogs sounds so bloody long and irritating and the album feels on the whole unenjoyable. The first few listens really beg the question - is this album for me? But then you listen more........The lyrics begin to become more important since they really gel the album together. And when that happens the delights begin to appear but you must have a lot of patience. I think that those who have a problem with this album have a valid point. It's not a question of &quot; not getting it,&quot; it's more a question of &quot; can you take it?&quot; And if you can, then we really are the sheep/dogs/pigs of this world!As has being said this album has a reason for it being difficult. Mainly this is were Waters becomes the tyrant of the band. This effectively becomes the end of the band ( you only have to listen to The Final Cut to know that ). Now this is one question. You look at the lyrics and you think &quot; yeah right on &quot; but then the whole thing smacks of hypocrisy in some respects. The tyrant of the band wants us to go against the tyrants of this world. In that case even Roger Waters get his just desserts. His filthy hands will then go off to his solo project ( which some fans will tell you are better than the last two Pink Floyd records but that's merely a question of taste!)So buy this album and you'll discover what sort of man ( or woman ) you are in this world. Or alternatively just rock out to the tunes and don't think of the lyrics. Sometimes being oblivious to the nature of the world can be a good thing!

Ah yes the nightmare Ronny Moorings doesn't want to see or hear of again. I can understand - this is dreadful stuff. Well OK I'm being a bit cruel. But the songs sound so tuneless that it's horrible to believe that this is the same band who would make A Day and Your Vice - then again I suppose technically it's not since the band has changed many times. I think this must be the point where Anka moved out and Mojca came in on the next album. But there tends to be a total lack of depth in the music ( I was going to say originality but even at their greatest Xymox were never the most original in terms of music but were enjoyable ).You probably have to be an utter diehard to enjoy this at all. But then maybe all Xymox fans are a little diehard

I really wanted to see this film. Mainly, like some people have said here, to see Bill Murray. Was I satisfied? Well yes and no. If I were to watch this movie before all the hype began to build I would have been giving you a 4 or 5 star review perhaps about how tragic this film entwines the characters but sadly when you put hype and Oscar nomination talk together it usually drowns out what might have been fun about the film in the first place. The film is brilliantly acted and it is really funny in places. As ever Bill Murray gets the best lines although Scarlett Johannsson does manage to get a few in herself and it does leave a distinct mark in your mindSo why 3 stars then? Well as I've said this film has completely been drowned out by all the critics' rave reviews of the film which is a shame really. What is understated could be passed off for underwhelming in some people's eyes. And I don't really blame them for thinking that. If this wasn't as talked about as it was - perhaps people could have enjoyed it a little more without some weight of expectation around itI am glad though that the film picked up an Oscar. It deserved one if nothing else. It was, if anything, Oscar material.....but then usually I don't go for those types of movies ( American Beauty being a major exception ). I went to see it for 2 reasons - Bill Murray and I liked Sophia Coppola's last film - the fantastic Virgin Suicides.So to cut it short I would recommend people watching this but I would also advise to lower your expectations - It isn't a major full blown piece - just a softly-softly film

This album is going to attract many people as it will repel. You're not going to find anything that will have people praising highly or those spitting venomous bile.Whether or not you can call this art, I don't know but at least and those who call it a joke are not too far off the mark. It's Lou Reed's idea of fun. And fun it may be for him but it takes a masochist to enjoy this. Listen to whatever side you want or even the full album if needs must.But surprisingly this album actually has proved an inspiration for a generation of artists. You listen to Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Einsturzende Neubauten in their early years and you'll find pieces of MMM in their music ( or noise if you prefer to call it that way ). If you listen to Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising there's a part in the album where they play a 5 second snippet forwards and backwards. And of course there is the prima Japanese artists such as Merzbow who is much more harsher than this. If you Metal Machine Music is noise, just listen to Merzbow - THAT'S NOISE. I can only stomach one CD of Merzbow and that's similar in style to this oneOh and by the way - if you've listened to the samples on Amazon it's pretty much like that all the way. Like it and want the album? Go ahead and buy it if you want. Feel the urge to kill Lou after hearing those samples? Try Coney Island Girl, that'll be more normal I reckon

Given what has been said about the original Beatbox missing from this CD which does seem a little bit of a shame. To be honest I had no idea that this version of Beatbox was not the original since this was originally released before I was even born. But having said that I still like what's on offer here. It's immensely fun to listen to. To hear all matter of things like a car starting up is quite weird but fun too. The rest of it bar Moments In Love sounds like it was perfect music for some people to breakdance to ( not that I can do that sort of thing ). But this is a real joy to listen toI have another query - the DVD is good but a little short in my opinion. It would have been nice to see some more videos than just the four that were given. And speaking of the fourth track -it does seem rather ill fitting when the other 3 sound similar in style while this one kinda sticks out like a sore thumb. If they had put more videos in the DVD it would have been easier to see the changes ( after all this is my first Art of Noise purchase really so bear that in mind please ) but other than that I've no real complaints

I think this film gets it's inspiration from the great German arthouse film, Metropolis. I know it's got a track on here called Metropolis. Whether it really connects with the film is another matter and I'm not saying that people should try and play the two simultaneously to see if I'm right or anything but it was just a thought.Anyway as for the album....the music is as ever fantastic. The Model is my favourite song here as it sounds like a prototype for the future synth pop bands who were to be an inspiration for them.By the way rumour has it that there is a new Kraftwerk album coming out. Finally there is something to be cheerful about

This is a very scary film. The basic story is that a ballerina finds out that her school is run by witches and the occult. There are a lot of gory scenes - women being cut up by barbed wires , a blind man being attacked by his own guide dog - but I think what really scares me is the soundtrack - such a creepy and at times fiercely black sounding it makes the film that bit more atmospheric ( a bit too much some might feel )However if you're up for something gruesome this'll be the film for you

The Matrix - great special effects - one hell of a lousy movie. The movie just tended to be rather dull without all the action. Their attempts at making what the Matrix really is about is rather dull and heavy handed. Other than that the film was high on action but not enough on classIncidentally I thought Fight Club was a better movie - had more humour in it

This is a scary CD to listen. It is Neubauten at their most extreme and it can appear to be unlistenable at times. Not recommended to everyone but if you made your way here and bought it the only feeling you'll ever get is that you are to blame if you don`t like it or if you do like it - keep it down low so that nobody else complains about it

This is 57 minutes long. That's an album length really but some class it as an EP because it only has 3 tracks on it. Anyway that's besides the pointSonic Youth go back to their &quot; classical avant garde &quot; roots and came up with the SYR series. This is strange music/noise depending how you view your avant garde. There's not really much I can say about this album.....you just have to listen to it with an open mind because when you start to talk about records like these it either gets rather technical and people will be lost ( which is why the joke &quot; Avant garde? I avant garde a clue mate comes into play ) or people will make stuff up in the hope it makes them sound clever. An open mind is all you need for this album. That way you can accept the album for what it is or reject as well if needs must.The only gripe I have with this album though is Kim's singing. It's badly out of tune at times ( there'll be some though who adore it ) but that's only minor. Happy listening

I really like this album. The singles practically made me buy this. And the rest of the album is pretty nice too. Okay it may sound a little video-gamey to some but I find part of that as the attraction in it for me. The songwriting is I think a little more stronger than usual. I do admit as a pop album it is a little off-kilter. But that's a good thing really. It's less gay disco and more.....different I suppose.If you're a serious muso than yeah you're probably already dismissing this album as candyfloss fluff that you'd be wasting on your money on but come on, lighten up, this is just pop music. Maybe not straight-ahead pop music but pop music in any other name. Besides we've all got guilty pleasures, what's yours?

I know that live albums are usually a waste of time - what's the point in listening to a live CD when you weren't there? If you were not there you missed it and renders this CD pointless. Now I love DM as much as anybody else and I bought this off a friend who found it in his house for 7........to me the whole album fails to translate whatever significance the show had. I know that it was a very emotional night for them but what use is that when you hear identikit tunes just with a crowd singing along. Just seems like another gig to me. I think you'd probably have to be a DM mad completist to get any sort of pleasure out of this but I think it would be better to stick with the studio albums.....after all live albums are usually nothing gimmicks to all but those who went to the gigs themselves. Pity the video didn't show the concert in full.......that would have been interesting to watch ( live videos are usually much better than live CDs )

Basically this a sci-fi flick with an interesting story. The actors were not as atrocious as in Glen or Glenda. Sure they were wooden, but they weren't as cardboard cut out as Dolores was in that or many of the actors that were in that. In some ways though sympathies have to go to Bela Lugosi. He tries his damnedest to do his best in every film and is only let down by nearly all of those around him. His assistant Lobo ( or Tor ) isn't so bad himself. He plays the silent part well and knows how to carry out his job perfectly. It's just a pity he had to be in this film. Everybody else just is a bit too hammy in their acting to be really believable and well when it comes to inanimate objects that are pretending to be snakes or giant octopusses, the less said the better! Well actually, I might as well divulge them anyway......basically see them scream and squirm and toss and turn when the thing does absolutely nothing is hilarious.Another problem is the ending which happens a little too quick. I know some might just turn off the DVD when they think it's all just crap but it seems Ed spent ages on how to plot the suspense and leaves you short changed on the ending. Just a simple few words &quot; He messed with...&quot; blah blah blah and kaboosh show's over folks. It's not so much of a happy ending as more of a botched job of an ending. Still there's a dramatic improvement in this film and Glen or GlendaBut Ed tried, honestly he tried

Yeah that sort of word gets bandied around a lot. If something is just a little bit weird, it deemed " surreal "This film however really is surreal and while I don't want to give anything away ( how can I? If I were to describe this you'd probably think I was a bit cuckoo ), it is brilliantly acted. I remember watching this the first time in a friend's house. I brought it over since I really wanted to see it and not some horrible Hollywood movie and all I can say is that when the film was finished and I went to the toilet, I looked at myself in the mirror and I was as white as a ghost. There was not one bit of colour in me. That's how bizarre and scary this film is.However ( on a side note ) if you're looking for a similar film I would suggest getting Un Chien Andalou. Made in 1928 but equally as baffling and surreal. Watch both Un Chien Andalou and Eraserhead back to back and I guarantee you - it's not a pleasant experience

This is a somewhat strange album because you're not expecting the synthesizers to sound THAT primitive. But given a bit of time the results do stand out for themselves. It also gives us that rare thing of a Cabaret Voltaire novelty track in Do The Snake where Mallinder ( at least I think it's him - his voice sounds so different than on later records ) intoning &quot; Gonna make you slide gonna make you shake &quot; and &quot; Get up...no I mean...Get down &quot; and just a generally fun song in all. The last three tracks Venusian Animals, The Outer Limits and She Loved You are all very paranoid with Mallinder whispering on the last track &quot; She loves you, she knows your number, she says she almost lost her mind.&quot; Also The Outer Limits has the odd sound of cash registers opening and closing on the song. Definitely a paranoid listen

Well it still is Cabaret Voltaire because the lyrics are still paranoid but the music is getting lighter in form but that doesn't mean it's crap. Sensoria is probably the song that gets most people into Cabaret Voltaire with the juttery "D-d-d-Do right." But there are other songs on here to make you feel like dancing. Digital Rasta is a beautiful song where Mallinder sings " Selling something like you sell yourself, money in the bank but your under pressure" making it the perfect mate for you when you're a little peed off about your managerOf course it might take a bit of time if you bought The Crackdown and were expecting something similar ( it's not quite the same ) and/or if you think the amount of tracks you get is not enough to make you shell out your money but stick with it - it's a good album

If you want the review of the stuff that was on the original DVD you can read it thereWell this rerelease has a bit of a funny story ( for me anyway ).I noticed that they had released this on video as well and I remember going mad because I only bought the other one a few months beforehand and just cursing my luck. Then on Paddy's Day I was hoping to trade videos ( including the DM video ) so I could get enough money to get this one here. I was out of luck on that front - even when I went for the long shot in HMV ( who don't do this sort of thing.When I walked out an idea hit me - why don't I see if they have the video and try to trade it in. I went back in, extremely nervous, thinking " they'll never do this, they'll see right through me " and just went for it. I went up to the counter and made a little story that I got it for a present a few weeks ago but I saw that there was a new version and was hoping that I could change it. The girl at the till said if I had a receipt and I said " No unfortunately not." I was still nervous and I was amazed when she said to get the other video and they'd do the transaction. I was amazed, the idea worked!!!!!!! What made it seem more amazing was that the new version cost 3 less than the old one so I got 3 in discount vouchers. I was absolutely chuffed with myself - didn't think I'd get away with that oneNow onto the review of the extra stuff on the video. There's But Not Tonight which, as good as the song is, it seems like just an ordinary video that you would see on MTV America at the time. Nothing particularly special about itStrangelove '88 is a rather pointless video that is inferior to the original - besides it's just the album version and it's better that we just enjoy the originalThe Violator film is interesting as it shows the reactions of Martin and Dave while having a good sense of humour about it. They show a couple of videos ( Personal Jesus and Enjoy The Silence I think ) and they provide welcome relief from the interviewThe SOFAD film captures the mood of the band perfectly......but that's not always enjoyable. Alan clearly looks pissed off with the whole thing, Dave clearly sounds like a drug addict, telling Paul Gambaccini ( the most irritating guy around at the time ) " don't say that, for f**k sake " when told that his tattoos were seemingly " springing to life." The atmosphere is really cold in this film. Martin seems a little subdued here. It's like he'll talk about everything but he doesn't really want to. In fact, it's Fletch who livens the interview up a good deal and I think it's to his credit that he does this. He may talk about business matters for some of it but he does make the interview not so much of a slog as it would have been without him.But it makes the songs of SOFAD seem so much better here ( which I make no secret of how much I hate ) and gives a well deserved break ( and that is an understatement )The One Caress video is one where the directors must have thought " These Depeche Mode guys, they're very gothic, let's do some overly gothic video to suit the mood of the music " and it's this that makes the video seem out of place with the song. It was gothic for the sake of being gothic and that's not always a good thing ( in fact, I don't know if it has ever been a good thing )The Condemnation ( Paris Mix ) is just the Condemnation video cleverly retitled to lure you inAnd finally we have the Ultra film. This has Ireland's very own Dave Fanning. If anyone finds him irritating, it's OK, a good few people think the same here in Ireland, so you're not alone! The interview itself is much more relaxed and very interesting and we find out that Dave was " a clever junkie." It adds a nice touch to the video as well. And again we get the videos from earlier on to help see out the video.I still give this 5 stars because of the overall content and I would still recommend it to anyone interested. I just hope I haven't started a trend from what I said earlier on! Oh and by the way I've noticed that they're selling my video for it's full price....I know this because I forgot to rewind the tape! Still at least they can make money out of it ( again )

This is a fantastic video to watch. The videos themselves tend to be more enjoyable and hypnotic than their early videos ( OK who really wants to see Dave, Marty and Fletch smash plates of jelly ) and in some cases the music ends up being merely incidental as the videos are awe inspiring and truly astonishing.Stripped tends to have the feeling of being outside on wintry English suburb where the guys smash the cars to bits and act psychotic in a way when they want to see you...A Question of Time is Anton's first video with them and it is a rather hilarious tale of a man who delivers babies on a motorbike. It's very strange but you just can't help but admire the beautiful scenery that you take in while watching these events happen.As video after video passes by you tend to think, how can they outdo each other but then by the time Enjoy The Silence comes on it tends to get the goosebumps going and the emotions at searing point. The scenery that is on display is quite breathtaking and shows a king who is walking throughout the world to get away from the madness and to have some peace and serenity. Truly magnificentThe SOFAD songs suffer quite badly apart from I Feel You, they seem more and more like a summing up and they generally tend to be not that interesting ( save In Your Room which is actually a bit creepy ). Maybe I say this because I really don't like SOFAD because of little details that I'll keep to myself for now.Then into the last straight of videos come in. Barrell Of A Gun is really creepy and I remember when I was young being so scared of this video that I could not watch it. But I finally did one time and thought it was a rather nice song. It's No Good follows and this is a really hilarious video. It travels to this hotel and Depeche Mode play this past-it rock stars playing in bars and wherever people may listen to them. The funny thing is Dave Gahan plays the lead singer who still lives inside a dream that he is god and he is untouchable.The rest of the video is for you to watchThe last video is a non-album track called Only When I Lose Myself and this video is very creepy. Some DM fans think that " without Anton, DM rely on what the director tells them " ( this is true in the case of Exciter's videos ( Dream On is good but other than that - yeuch )). Anyway what is basically the story is that every object is frozen apart from humans. They are either crying or are stumbling around. I wonder if the director of this video fancied the idea of imitating Cronenberg's movie Crash. If so he's got it right perfectly as what you are seeing is undoubtedly as creepy as the movie.There's a short film to rap everything up and then everything's done. A rather good video to get if you want to see the visual side of Depeche Mode ( or if you just want to see them ). A video that is recommended to anybody that is interested in either the band or maybe even film students who want to capture the essence of visuals.

Any Nick Cave album is hard to review. You honest opinion will seem slight and insignificant towards somebody like him. Because in these days he has become something of a legend. All I can say is that this album is brilliant from start to finish and is worth every last cent. That's all I can say really other than this album far outweighs it's successor, Junkyard, which was, in all honesty a complete drug addled mess. Still had some good songs though

I could give you a detailed synopsis of this film about has-been rock stars that still think they're larger than life but others have done that down to a tee. What I will say is when you have Ozzy Osbourne say that he didn't find it funny because he thought "it was all too f**king real" then you know the film is worth watching and is ultra-realistic. And hilariously so!

Released in 1991 at the height of the rave culture in the UK you can see that this CD has dated somewhat in terms of sound. The analogue synths sounding almost quaint today. But having said that it's still a fun listen to mainly for the singles In Yer Face and Cubik. But there's a lot of hidden gems in here - this is somewhat Bjork's debut outside of The Sugarcubes. And the two tracks are a bit mixed. In QMart she just does a lot of growling and I don't know whether she's making up nonsensical sounds or if she's singing in her native Icelandic language. Either way it's a little bit irritating or idiosyncratic depending on what your view is. Ooops, however is a different story. Everything is beautiful: the arrangements and Bjork's singing combined make a surprisingly effective and affecting song. Again I can't catch the lyrics completely but I do know they're being sung in English. Bernard Sumner also makes an appearance ( it wouldn't be the last time he collaborated with techno acts ) and it's a nice song. The rest however such as Nephatiti, Lambrusco Cowboy, Techno Bell and Olympic are as equal to the rest of the tracks. In short while the production values may leave this a somewhat dated but it can still pack an effective punch.

There really isn't any other way of looking at it. You've got over 140 minutes of pure dark music. I read that this was supposedly &quot; satanic &quot; but on listening to this I just thought it was similar to Tangerine Dream's Zeit which was another kinda drone album done with synths. No doubt, the first track would kinda lull you into a sort of false sense of security giving that it sounds almost kinda happy. But after track 2 the album really begins. I wouldn't play the 2 CDs back to back because then it would get rather monotonous. And of course by all means, don't play this if anyone else is in the room - they might get a bit annoyed or freaked out!I found this in a second hand store when I was in Germany and me and my friend made a joke about the name of the tracks and just started to nickname them &quot; The DNA Barcoders.&quot; Another friend though of hers couldn't see why we found the tracks a joke because she found it scary ( as well as the music ) so it just goes to show you - play this by yourself!

Since Killing Joke have had a long and varied career. Some new to the game ( me being one of them for a while ) found it hard where to go first. I picked this up because it had Love Like Blood ( which I think is just gorgeous ) and it had an overview on their material from 1979-1990. I have not been disappointed with this release as it has made me buy even more of their material if and when I can. It's interesting to note that the cover was one of the first flyers the band had used for a gig and caused a lot of controversy for what you see on the cover ( A priest giving the Nazis his blessing ) that the organizer refused to let them play at the venue!Overall a very good introduction to Killing Joke but I do find the last track to be somewhat out of place with the rest of them. But some of you may disagree with that view. However, buy this compilation and soon you may be buying more Killing Joke records than you would have thought possible

This box set is very exhausting as it is so perserveringly dark but there are flashes of humour along the way. I can only best describe this as being made to watch all of your nightmares in one go. Good music and if it were to remind me of anyone it would be Philip K Dick just because they both release a hell of a lot of material that has equally unsettling topic issues.If you are new to the Cabs game - I would suggest either of the two Original Sound Of Sheffield CD's ( preferably 83-87 ) as they are a bit more accessible to the ear. Otherwise wait until you buy a few more of their releases before settling for this as this is what Richard H Kirk describes as " music for people who had nothing to lose and only themselves to please "

This album is seriously damaged. Lyrically it sounds like the view from someone who is so emotionally damaged, so disillusioned with life and love that the idea of sex is an act of violence. Relationships are so cold and icy that they almost cease to exist. Accompany this with the music and you have the music which is so glacial that it's helps the album well. It's hard to keep on about an album like this when you really can't fault anything. It may not instantly grab you and Howard Devoto's voice may not be the most instantly appealing thing you'll ever hear but stick with it as there's plenty to admire if given time.

This is the sound of a man who was clearly impressed with the work of early Einstuerzende Neubauten. The music is paired down to the *ahem* bare bones of percussion for the most part. It seems the perfect accompaniment to Tom's grizzled vocals. Though that's of course whether you can take the idiosyncrasies of the man. Essentially this is for fans of the man's work.....if you can't tolerate his stuff....best steer clear of him....otherwise you could do what other reviewers of this CD have done. Have a search around....it's all entertainment!

When Kubrick made this film I'm sure he must have thought &quot; Hmmm well since this is a movie about space why don't we space the film out eh? &quot; And well for this movie does have a serious message about the space and how it could end up being a new beginning for man ( at the point when it was filmed ) but Kubrick must have had a little laugh. Admittedly the film is rather boring on the whole but I'd still watch those lands being filmed through a kaleidoscope any day and all those psychedelic images as well. They really make the film. And also maybe what detracts the film these days is that everyone has copied scenes in it to death that what probably seemed groundbreaking at the time now seems rather jaded because of the endless copying and that it eventually becomes worthless. Kubrick is a good director though, his films are usually very good. And this probably was - probably is given the amount of directors who are influenced by him and all but I can't really say I enjoyed this film because there's nothing worse than saying &quot; Oh I saw that somewhere before &quot;Perhaps it one of those movies that people would have said &quot; You just had to be there man at the beginning &quot; because I certainly wasn't

There've been quite a number of bad reviews for this for some reason or another. There have been some praising this as a more interesting and intriguing entry from DIV so you'll either see this as genius or god-awful rubbish. I think it's rather good actually, perhaps this is due to liking/owning some Krautrock albums and on some of these they nail it perfectly without sounding like a bunch of imitators. Some of it does border on imitation, Zugaga being a rather almost perfect rendering of Kraftwerk's Trans Europe Express and Heil Xanax and Sons of Rother being rather Neu/La Dusseldorf influenced. But that doesn't detract from the album in my opinion - it's only helpful to show that they're not stabbing around in the dark - they know what they're doing. The live album that comes with this though is rather pointless.....although if it were a DVD I would probably tell you otherwise but I can't. It is good but why need it is all I ask. Most electronica live albums are sheer lunacy and a prime example of bloodless music even if you do like them. Regardless of that, this album is well worth the effort although maybe you might want to question the price first....although I'd say you should get it right away

This is just awful. And I mean spine-tingingly bad. The songs are so terrible and so insistent that it makes you feel like kicking the TV in. The idea of the film is certainly interesting....certainly if it weren't played out as a musical. But it is and you can just see some of the actors baffled as to the sheer stupidity of what their doing. Some such as Tim Curry revel in the sheer nonsense this film provides. But seriously, those songs are beyond awful. My hatred for them rivals having to listen to Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and that's intense. But Kate Bush has made some great songs so that's OK. This however, is the movie equivalent of getting an axe through your spinal cord. How it's achieved cult status is something that will have to go down on the peculiar habits of humans.One to buy if you're an eccentric soul who loves to hear people singing out of tune, out of key and with little regard to anything other trying to sound funny when it clearly isn't. In short if you like those Simpsons episodes where there's not 5 seconds without launching into another song. Or if you're one of those people who thinks the idea of transvestites/men-in-drag appealing then this is for you. Or alternatively you are one f***ed up masochistic person. The DVD is there - enjoy....or rather endure

This is classed as Wire's pop album and to some certain extent it is their pop album. But it's an undeniably weird pop album. The lyrics don't make much sense and if you listen closely there is some weird instrumentation. On one of the tracks it sounds like one of the guitars is spinning out of control. But essentially it is a pop album. Yes there are synths here but like on The Ideal Copy they don't predominate the album too much. Again it seems like the only logical step forward that they could do. And it's worth it to listen to and it is an album that can be enjoyed over and over again....but you might agree, you might not. Either way you should try the album

This is one serious headtrip for the connoisseur. All the sounds blend in and out of each other. It feels almost darkly sensual how the sounds wrap around each other that it is slightly evocative of haunted house and ghosts in the mirror ( admittedly to my twisted imagination ). It manages to sound totally psychedelic ( to me ), haunted and truly emotional on occasions.Some of you may remember my review of Lifeforms being less than impressed with it. This, however, is something to be impressed with. This truly is awe-inspiring. It truly is my favourite FSOL album of them all ( bar The Isness/Otherness because I haven't got it yet ). This is an album that works on many different levels. If you are feeling introspective, this is the album for you. If you want to take psychedelic drugs, it may not be the album for you but then it again it could be ( depends on how it affects you ). If you want to be lost in the sound of an album, this is the album for you. In fact, just buy the bloody thing. It'll be worth your while, trust me.

" So yeah dude have you got that new Arcade Fire album. It's totally cool."" Nah man that stuff's just for wimps and 15 year old cred seekers constantly looking at Pitchfork or some lame-ass magazine and totally buying into what they say. It's horses*it "" No way man, like it's totally cool. Have you listened to it fully man, don't judge an album just because it's been hyped to bits. Give it time, man!"" Jake, man I've heard it a million times when I go to look for new CDs and I even hear it at work. From start to finish and it really annoys the s*it out of me. I feel like I wanna kill them for making such a crappy record, like."" But why? "" Why? You're asking me why? Because it sounds like some bad mixture of New Order and U2 plus some dire emo crap....."" How the f*ck can it sound like U2, man, it sounds like nothing like them. You need your ears washed."" No you do. They sound so bad I wish I could slip them cyanide pills in their drink......"" That's sick. You wouldn't do that, would you?"" Try me. Play that album one more time and I might just do it. I ain't afraid to either."" Man I never knew you could hate something THAT much."" You'd be surprised. I've come to the conclusion that indie now stands for 'innocent ninnies don't initiate enterprise.' The music's just not original anymore. It has no heart" Oh but you didn't hear about the story that went behind this, it's so, like, heartbreaking."" No it's not. I completely empathize with their grief at losing relatives but that still doesn't make this album any good. Can we drop the subject. I feel like punching something."" OK, man, I'll drop it. I still don't understand your point of view but I guess I'll just have to accept it."

This album is something really interesting. Given how everyone remembers Eurythmics for songs such as Sweet Dreams, There Must Be An Angel.... and so on, we have the idea that they were a pop band first and foremost and of course, for the most part that is right. They were. They were an extremely good pop band too. Not something I'd readily pick up mind. There have been some songs which have been great and some that are vapid nonsense. I, for one, cannot stand There Must Be An Angel which showcases Annie Lennox's vocals to extremely good affect but the song has nothing to add to it. But this album is different. Very much within the sound and texture of the album. It's not what you'd expect.From the first track, you can tell this wasn't going to be a commercially viable record to release. It sounds somewhat cold, dislocated and out of place. Even though there's more guitars on this album than any other Eurythmics song I've heard, it feels a lot more colder than those songs! This can be due in part to Conny Plank's production work which is always interesting without fail.What Plank seems to have melded together is a stunning mixture of exotic influences melded to a strictly European sensibility and within that a certain Britishness. Even though in the liner notes it says the band felt themselves more European than British, within the music there still retains that sense of Britishness but without any of the negative aspects, and the embracing of European influences clearly help this album fluorish.Annie's voice on this album is, for the most part, very subdued and wistful. It compliments the music very well which takes on very dreamy and exotic tones while at the same time, giving a sense of being disenchanted with all around them. Very few can make an album that sounds like that and even fewer make it sound as interesting as it does, so it's all credit to Annie and Dave for orchestrating an album as good as this.I could go on about the cover too but that would be pretty pointless. To cut it short, I feel it compliments the album. It looks of it's time too but in a good way.Tracks like Take Me To Your Heart, Caveman Head and Never Gonna Cry Again have a sense of enchantment and disenchantment while Sing-Sing ( which is sung in French ) only encaptures the sense of dreamy wonder that is sometimes forgotten in music. Of the extra tracks Heartbeat Heartbeat and 4/4 In Leather should also get a mention for being frenetically paced that seriously test those dancing shoes but perhaps not as overtly as anything that would follow.Overall, this album is one of a kind, one which the band has never repeated and perhaps no one could attempt to duplicate this album as the amount of intricate details in the album is simply spellbinding!

First off I'll admit that I am no real fan of the Super Furry Animals so indeed if you are a fan you're going to really disagree with what I think. Having said that I'll try to really review this album without the useless " Hahahaha this band really suck, you like sh***y bands if you like this band," because it doesn't really work. Normally bands usually give critics ammunition for their hatred and in " If You Don't Want Me To Destroy You " they have the perfect song. It's typical because, like practically many songs on this album it destroys a good thing when they should just leave it be. They seem to forever try to fill in every little space when it's completely unnecessary and for a supposedly " trippy " band they're distinctly untrippy. They don't even sound psychedelic at all....the sound isn't at all lively and sometimes I'm convinced I've heard the same guitar riff for the past 5 songs.But I'll give them credit for Hermann Loves Pauline - truly a great song that they didn't try and destroy to pieces within the first 45 seconds. It is actually a great sing-a-long pop song worthy of the best in the business but they're later attempts at the pop song are nothing short of annoying. Drawing Rings Around The World is a horrible Beach Boys parody that begs belief. Also, Juxtaposed Wit U is their Barry White song and it's not much of a looker in that. Fire In My Heart was the biggest mistake in a single as it sounds absolutely dead as a song. The rest as you know, is very familiar and well, not much else to make for good listening unless you are a crazed fan ( which from experience seems to be most SFA fan )But then these are Indie Royalty according to Mojo, Q, NME and practically any magazine you care to read and it seems such a sin to criticise their work for some ungodly reason to which many fans will lambast you for being a blasphemer and a heathen to the cause. Oh well, you can't please everybody!Speaking of sin, this whole thing reminds me of the film, Naked Lunch, where the two writers are expressing their views. One says that he has to get things in from every angle so as to let everyone know what the feeling is supposed to be. Whereas the other writer has a more " Catholic interpretation." From listening to SFA this seem to try and get all angles but with very little perspective at all

Once again Bauhaus had returned with a better album than the last and this if they had fallen apart earlier would have been a better sign off but that's not the point of reviewing these things. It's the music that matters ( such a throwaway gimmick that line is ). In truth this kicks off with a very good rendition of Brain Eno's Third Uncle. I heard the original a while back and it never ceases to amaze me just how the f**k can Peter Murphy can get that song note perfect, I mean it's beyond me.However another song that really gets me going is the song Swing The Heartache. If only guitar riffs were like that track. It's sheer brilliance. However picking songs is a hard thing to do since they are all exceptional. I highly recommend this album as it is just sheer class

I bought this since it was relatively cheap in a shop there was and I figured, I had nothing to lose and got what I expected which was the sound of teenagers making a bit of noise and having fun. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah, tracks like Cookie Puss are hilarious but the other tracks here are equally as incompetent yet good. Yes I'm looking at it from the " so bad it's good " catalogue but really it's pretty fun to listen to. I have more fun listening to this than the dreadful cack like The Clash or the Sex Pistols ( Heresy? Bring it on! ). The letter which the band received from a disgruntled concert attender pretty much sums it up though. They are sub-Minor Threat, Bad Brains et al but really you shouldn't expect this to mean anything. They're 16-18 year olds here. They were having fun, nothing else.

Does it matter that the effects are dated? Does it matter when the music is this good? No, of course not! The main thing is seeing these songs in a live(ish) context. The visuals are lovely if you discard the special effects. Hey it was the 70s - don't expect anything wildly new. If you didn't buy it for the music you didn't buy it at all.There are some snippets of interviews with the band and the making of Dark Side of The Moon. You can practically forget the interviews - they're not something special. While Dave and Nick talk more about the music and being &quot; slaves to technology &quot; in the past with the music, Roger is on more of a political frame of mind ( surprise surprise ). A bit surpising that Richard wasn't asked for his opinion on things ( seems like a little flavour of things to come doesn't it? ). The making of Dark Side is a little interesting - some nice touches and an early glimpse of those Synthi AKS synthesizers or as Richard H Kirk of Cabaret Voltaire once said that they looked like &quot; suitcases.&quot;You really have to have this is your collection if you are a fan of Pink Floyd - no two ways about it

After hearing this in a shop I have to work in anytime they're short of a few people constantly I feel the urge to right down my opinion. I could have claimed blissful ignorance but unfortunately that's been tarnished.First off let's get one thing straight - Crazy In Love was and still is a fantastic pop song - let's make no mistake of that. It was infectious and impossible to resist no matter how much you wanted to hate it - it had charisma ( something lacking in today's charts ). And even if they sampled the hook from somewhere else it was made it's own.Now another song I have an issue with is Naughty Girl....but for all the wrong reasons. She should never have messed with Donna Summer's Love to Love You - the guitars are slowed down a little and it completely wrecks the fun of Love to Love You. And to even sing the line at the start makes it all the more irritating. Still I suppose if Donna Summer gets a few fans because of this then that's alright but it does a disservice to the songThe rest of it tends to completely pass by and be meaninglessly bland and no hook that grabs you. Another thing that does happen when you listen is that you can hear that Beyonce really forces herself when she sings. Nothing is natural and she's not at ease with herself which would explain the constant back up she needs on this album. I understand she has a passion for her music but she needs to relax a little.Now someone will probably wonder why I'm doing this review when I heard this in work. The answer is simple - the job basically has me standing around doing nothing waiting for somebody to give me something to do or tell me I have lunch or just tell me to go home! So this is what happens! I've heard the album enough to know what I'm talking aboutShe can sing - I have no doubts about that but a lot of the time she forces herself to do so much that she needs to remember once in a while to relax and let everything take it's own course ( you can work out the rest of the pun for yourself! ). But that's what happens when you have too ambition without any clear view of what it is exactly

After the claustrophobic nightmare ( I mean that as a compliment ) of Confusion is Sex came Bad Moon Rising. And yes it does seem quite a bipolar album. Not as scary as Confusion but then not as entirely mellow as their recent releases. It remains enigmatic though as while listening to this you get the sense of a strange calm with this CD and that's odd given the weird guitar noise that comes with this CD. Obviously the most accessible track here is Death Valley 69 with additional vocals from Lydia Lunch. It's good but what makes this album really good is it's sense of flow - there's no sense of upstaging the other one or the other track. Sure it has it's highlights but it doesn't feel like a disjointed albumI can ramble on about this album for ages because I really love it to bits.....this is the best I can do to try and review this album without running to the point of meaningless jibberish.....buy the album for yourself and see for yourself whether you agree with me or not

Ah the Kaiser Chiefs. Big Leeds United fans. You can tell because they picked the name Kaiser Chiefs as their name because one of the former Leeds players, Lukas Redaebe, played for a team called the Kaiser Chiefs. Now I can't watch Gillette sports update without hearing the Kaiser Chiefs being rung out one more time.What got them their deal was the uber-band of the moment Franz Ferdinand hyping them up to be something equally special. And, as is the natural way with things. Anything that NME-hyped band like will naturally make it's way through the back door to the NME and the rest of the music press.And now to the music. Well if you own a copy of a Britpop album of the last ten years ( Pulp, Blur etc. ) you pretty much know what to expect here. There's no surprises. All the quirks you got from Blur's Parklife/The Great Escape are photocopied here. You'll hear passing resemblances to what made Blur before Damon Albarn turned into Maliman, cartoon pop-star etc ( eg XTC, The Smiths ) and so on. Is their originality in it? No, of course not.However the songs themselves are not bad. It's just they don't exactly leave you wanting more. Instead they kinda leave you baying for the originals. You crave for Blur, for XTC, for The Smiths, for Madness, for every influence photocopied and passed off as their own. It's a bit like a karaoke machine only you change the lyrics to fit with what you have in mind. And then there's the " Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh " that goes through every single song on this. It's cute when it's done once. Anything else and it outstays it's welcome.No doubt they're huge now but it's hard to see how they'll survive their second album. Surely no one can survive on photocopies. They may get you through if you're in need of a quick fix but it's never going to last long now is it?

This is a review I wrote 2 years ago. If you want to buy it after reading this go ahead, if not then it's no big deal"All songs are nicely made and a hint of weirdness . It wasn't as weird as I was told to believe but hey it's a good album that is worth its weight in salt .The songs are like a whirlwind and they suck you in and spit you out without a trace of remorse . The effects mess with your mind and once you get into it you start to understand the record .Best tracks on here are The national anthem , treefingers ( blissfully quiet ) and Motion picture soundtrack .I agree that this is not for everyone but if you at least give it a try then you will at least know something about the record "

This is a really good album but it kinda falters towards the end. Peter Murphy was out of contention for most of the album so the band played on without him. Some of the songs are brilliant and carry on the usual Bauhaus flair but near the end you can see that they were running out of patience with being Bauhaus. Fortunatly the extra tracks here save it from going out on a sour note.

This is a great CD that is both difficult and demanding as it is fun to listen to. Admittedly the fun might come later once you begin to accept and like this CD. The first track Pomme Fritz is possibly the most accessible track on the album. After that it get's a little weird. Possibly paranoid as well. Throughout the album you might hear someone talking about how he guns, compasses and some voices telling "you will die" which really makes you feel at ill at ease with the whole thing. Track 3 probably will have you freaked out the most. Martian like voices squeaking " We're happy to be with you are you listening" and then sped up and slowed down and sometimes saying some things without a trace of a meaningIn short it is one hell of an album to come to terms with but when it does begin to sink into you, you'll begin to love it

I've bought this a couple of months ago as it was one of those albums that I had wanted for practically ages. As soon as I put it in the CD player it had to be the most explosive piece of music ( not literally ) I'd ever heard. A volatile singer singing at times silly lyrics to extremely noisy and volatile music in the background. The second half of this record was a lucky accident as it were as the person who was recording it meant to record the whole Wire concert ( which you can find part of in Document&Eyewitness; ( which I also recommend )) but set it up all wrong. Just as well, the set is as you can probably tell by hearing it really fierce.In short, you must buy this album. NOW

There's not much else to say really. All the emotions you could think of are on display and the production on the album is minimal which gives the songs an added effect. In a way it shows how cover albums should be done or even just one cover version of a song should be done. That's all there is to say

Although for the life of me I can never remember the title of these songs if you were to push me, I still think that this album is fantastic. It has a few lightly paranoid edges to it being that the supposed concept was about a world going mad. I've also got a bootleg concert from around this era on cassette. And if you thought that Orblivion was good - this was insane. The tracks were mutated into something else. But to get back to the point, if you're looking for a modern psychedelic trip, then this is the album for you

The only problem is here is the songs ( or lack of ). We get 4 songs and their remixes which is hardly value for money but if you have a listen it's actually quite good. Alright the lyrics are a bit naff ( Cold Life has the line " You are such an awful race I'd rather live in outer space ) but if you can get past that the music is not too bad. The Halloween remix is actually pretty good and in some instances you get a flavour of proto-techno in the making.But again the tracks are going to come into question. Only 4 tracks and their remixes - it's not great. All Day comes up twice and both are not a patch on the version on Twitch ( it's similar yes, but the version on Twitch is slightly more aggressive, here it just sounds like a pansy of a prototype )Oh yes and for all those who are metalheads still reading this, yes Al does sound as if he's trying to be English. He's pretty good at it but it still makes you laugh.Well this is a very hard CD to recommend. It's likely that the diehards are the only ones who'll get this or those that will only buy Ministry's records " when they were those nice young men singing good ol' pop tunes!" If you are not a diehard or you're a fan of Ministry's later career, these are the two words which you should live by - forget it!

This is a chilling tale of what the future of TV could do and one man's descent into fantasy world by watching a 50 second clip of a snuff movie . It is a complicated enough journey into seeing where reality lies and where fantasy begins . As always with most Cronenberg films there is a lot of gorey parts to keep you satisfied . As for the ending ( which I don't want to give away ), it leaves a permanent mark in your mind and leaves you wanting more

In fact besides I'd go as far as to say this is perhaps the most competent Ed Wood movie around. Sure there are glaring errors such as Bela running back and forth to the grave in broad daylight ( when it's supposed to be night-time ) and his replacement is obvious ( come on, he's at least 4 inches taller I reckon ). And indeed the last 20 minutes descended into a farce that unfortunately sunk the film. Yes, it shows a degree of ineptitude on Ed's part but for most of the film there was an almost professional air to how the actors acted.Ed thought that he'll be remembered for this film. This was his big one and he's right, it's the one we remember him most for. However I don't think he would have liked the tag it's been given but if you want to be remembered he certainly went about the right way in doing it ( even if the results were all wrong )But if we start at the start with Bela's last real scene where he mourns his lover's death - that was a really touching scene. The emotion in that looks too real that it can't be described as fake or cardboard cut out. If anything that was the most poignant scene Ed ever captured on film. He may have been an inept film-maker but that was a stroke of genius - no kidding!I get the feeling Ed cast Vampira as Lugosi's wife mainly because if you've seen the Tim Burton movie you'll know that Lugosi thought she was &quot; a honey &quot; and it was certainly a nice gesture to Bela to do that. Vampira doesn't have to do much in this film. Just walk really slowly and look ominous whenever the camera is on her. Looks beautiful while doing so I have to admit. I'm almost certain that she inspired George Romero to make Night of The Living Dead by her walking alone.Criswell makes his appearance in this film and you have to say, him, along with Vampira and Tor, got almost uncanny lookalikes in Tim Burton's biopic that it seems almost spooky.Hats off to whoever had the idea of using saucer lids for um the use of flying saucers. Really neat and easily identified even if it was black and white. Still not too bad a job. Oh and who could forget Saturn as a ballbearing - Top Class!The last 20 minutes are a farce as I've said before mainly because it's supposed to be a showdown between the humans and the aliens....or to be more precise 3 men with guns and a man and a woman in funny clothing that are supposed to be aliens. The acting here is horrifically poor and despite it all being passionately acted it just seems.....well a bit silly. And whatever niggling doubts you had about the film leading up to the last 20 minutes, will no doubt be exposed by the end. A shame because the film showed Ed at his most coherent. And that sadly was the pinnacle of Ed's career.So all in all it's not the worst movie of all time and certainly not the worst you'll ever see ( unless you're a connoisseur of good taste and in that case what the hell are you reading this for ). Definitely his most enjoyable film. Now if someone could only just tell Criswell to shut up ( I wish Ed had tried, honestly try to do that ).But for Ed, this would be his shot at greatness and while it backfired, it was about as good as he could make it. Perhaps if he were making these now and not 40 years ago he might have gotten away with it. And I'm sure Ben Affleck would have been great as the dumb pilot if it were made now. Think about itHere's to Ed though - he may not have been the greatest but he sure knew how to entertain us

You're only getting this now while us Europeans have been enjoying this box set for quite some time now. Alas, some of you more impatient types probably ordered the whole 5 CD set from www.fcomshop.com and are already enjoying the benefits to know how good it is. Of course keep that website in mind. Amazon will only send you 3 out of the 5 CDs. If you want the other two - the website above will gladly help you.But now onto the music - well all I can say is that &quot; c'est tres magnifique.&quot; CD 1,2 and 4 will work great as a party mood but can also be listened to without having to dance - which is a little bit of a rarity given it's culture. CD 3 is more of a downbeat CD. Twisted electronica, jazzy moments and a spot of French pop from Alain Bashung ( Madame Reve ) make this a good time to relax after either partying hard with the other two CDs or having another stressful day at work. CD 5 is more of an angry mix made directly after Laurent's reaction to the extreme right wing coming into the second round of the presidential election. Listen to the track he made with Sangoma - it's pure undiluted rage.Of course, I should remind you that this will only happen if you order from www.fcomshop.com for CD4 and 5. It's really is worth it. Trust me I've done the same ( more out of a common belief that if I buy a box set I want it complete )Also assuming you have a computer with internet and I assume you do if you are reading this that's not all ( I'm beginning to sound like those guys you hear on QVC ). You'll get access to Laurent Garnier's website and also PBB which is where Laurent has his own sort of radio show on the internet. But don't worry it's just pure music and you never get the same set twice!So in recap this box set has much more value for money than what you might expect. So there's no other reason for any of you wondering on this but to go out and buy it!

I bought this on my travels in Leipzig and it has to go down as probably one of the odder CDs I've bought. While I've always enjoyed Miles Davis' work when I'm in the mood - I've never really bought any of his stuff until last year ( you'd have to excuse me on that part since his backcatalogue is rather daunting ). The very fact that half the album is live and half the album is recorded in the studio. How it meshed so well I don't know. The album can be very noisy but also have subdued quiet moments. I suppose if you were to look at it in one light - it's an album of contradictions that sit perfectly with each other. There's not really much else that I can say about this album except that when I am in the mood for this album it has to be listened as a whole because that's the whole experience of it and it would be only tainted otherwise.

This album just spews venom and is possibly the most corrosive industrial album that could easily stand up with the industrial pioneers such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle. Anybody who loves industrial music would be a fool not to get this album - it might take a while to get into but it's a certainly stood the test of time better than some records

That's the trouble with remixes. You always fear they'll turn in some godawful sh**e that you just have the urge to skip. And it happens here. Well it had to really given that this is the 3CD set. When I heard Mike Shinoda was doing a remix I thought it was going to be one hell of a bad remix but to give him credit....it wasn't bad. In fact there were a few that were worse than it. But if anything, the LFO remix of Lie To Me is so good, it manages to stay true to the original while being radically different. This remix more than any others ( for me at least ) captured the intensity that went into Depeche Mode's work. It perfectly compliments the lyrics and the way they are sung. It's obvious that they didn't take this remix lightly.But what else can I say really, it's a remix compilation so you do have to expect the various styles that go with it. Most of all just enjoy it.

I got this from a friend because she knew I liked Skinny Puppy and wasn't impressed with this album. I have to say on first listen I didn't really think much of it - the whole thing was all over the place and Nivek's strangled Canadian accent, without the electronic treatments for the most part, ranting about something or other and it was left as part of my collection gathering dust until now. Now I think it's as good as any Skinny Puppy album I have ( which is limited ). It seems there are a lot of albums I'm going back over that I didn't like at first but now really like. Probably because I was buying so many CDs and didn't have enough time to appreciate them. If people don't like this album, I can understand - this one doesn't quite grip you by the throat ( or by the balls ) as the others but it's a subtle charmer, something you probably wouldn't expect from a force like Skinny Puppy. However I wouldn't say it's cruelly misunderstood but it's worth investigation

While I've heard of the other remastered jobs on this ( " right I'll just use me old vinyl. Oh f**k it's scratched" ) this truly must be the definitive collection for this album. It may seem cheaply recorded for some but this is The Fall at possibly their rawest and possibly their most bile-ridden best. It truly has to be The Fall at heart. No other way to describe it, really. Highlights to watch out for are Spectre Vs Rector and Rowche Ramble with all it's outtakes. Possibly the most fun you'll ever have listening to a CD. Absolutely essential

I've never been a Human League fan but I bought Reproduction and was amazed at it's icy, chilly and perhaps wintry approach. This however is a bit like the thawing process between Reproduction and Dare and as a result it seems a bit patchy. The Black Hit Of Space is a good song and so is their cover of Only After Dark, but Dreams of Leaving really show up Phil Oakey's limitations as a singer. I suppose the same can be said for TBHOS were Oakey sounds a little wooden. Tracks like Marianne and a few others are pretty good but they just don't have the same heart as the songs on Reproduction. Having said that there are moments within some of those songs that are not so great where the song briefly comes alive and then dies off.....which was never the case with Reproduction.....it's a shame though that Ware and Marsh left the band because with that Human League's creative was stolen and soon they became a complete mess ( well OK after Don't You Want Me, Baby? - the classic karaoke hit of the 80s ). Their songs became bland and not much else.I've made this point out that if Reproduction was like Cronenberg's Shivers, then Travelogue was like Rabid, a poor patchy product that has it's moments but not as satisfying. I could be wrong of course. It's just my opinion that's all

Ah these are the sort of songs you'll probably hear at some holiday hotel in France. You can't help but hum along to the tune because you wouldn't really know what the lyrics are. At least that's the feeling I get from them. But seriously, these songs are beautiful in there simplicity and while 22 songs might stretch some people's patience - they are all welcome additions. I don't want to seem like a biased fan because this is the only CD I have of Francoise Hardy but I would be interested in getting some of her records. I just a need a few more records before I get a good opinion. This, as it is, is a good start for anyone interested in French pop from the 60s. Only thing I would have wished for is that they didn't include English versions of songs that were sung here in French. Sure they're still nice but I prefer the sensuality of the French language

This film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted. Occasionally the film lets itself down with it's editing. I sometimes feel disorientated thinking " wait slow down will you." Having said that - this film is well acted, and really puts you in the Netherlands of the 19th Century. It may not be as hard hitting and exciting as Turkish Delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching.

Let's not get carried away. This film is not a masterstroke from Cronenberg nor is it entirely terrible. But the film veers from side to side and in effect there are many parts of the film which have moments of genius mixed with moments of terrible scenes.Cronenberg himself has admitted that he had a moment of crisis while making the movie. He thought the whole film sounded ridiculous and maybe it wasn't worth it. He's got a point no matter what way your take on this film. It does border on the patently ridiculous but remember we're talking about a standard horror movie here. It's a cheap thrill'n'scare movie that most people would watch at a drive by cinema. We know there's going to be some cagey b-movie standard acting so we're not exactly taxing ourselves are we?Ah yes which reminds me, Marilyn Chambers actually doesn't do a bad job at giving " serious acting " a go. Cronenberg jokes that he doesn't know whose idea it was to tell her that his movies were " serious " but she acts well. I've never seen any of her porn material ( and I don't really want to either ) but there are times here when her history in porn might have helped her in his role. Actually give Ivan Reitman credit here - it was a brilliant idea to get Chambers in for this film - people are definitely going to take an interest if a porno star wants to make a go at serious acting ( especially men )There are some brilliantly shot scenes like when somebody takes a drill to a car with people in it ( that WOULD frighten people ) and the ending too which is rather chilling and is an effective ending for the film.So all in all it's not as good as later films such as Scanners, Videodrome, Dead Ringers or even Crash ( even though I have a love hate relationship with that movie ) in it's affecting creepiness. It's best looked at as a sophomore effort from Cronenberg and while it has serious flaws in the film, it has moments of demented magic too given it's nature. And remember it's a b-movie so you shouldn't expect much

Useless addition to the halos - you have the single ( might as well listen to it on the album ) you have Starf**kers Inc ( might as well listen to it on the album ) and the quiet version ( pointless but pretty ) All in all you must be a raving loony obsessed NIN fan to have this although I don't see the point in having it. Luckily I sold mine so I haven't got to hear this anymore

Normally I'd give films 1 or 2 for something that was terrible and that I didn't like. Ed Wood however is an exception. His films are bad but so bad they're good. Basically I could tell you all of what the other reviewers have said here. But I won't other than to say that I got this DVD really cheap in Tower Records ( 6 ) and I can say that this really was cheap entertainment. Lugosi's role in this is somewhat silly given that the film doesn't know whether it wants to be a genuine film or a shockumentary! And in some ways that's part of it's charm while it harms the whole process. It gives Lugosi the chance to spew wannabe crypto mumbo jumbo. In a way, he doesn't really &quot; pull ze strings &quot; so much as cut them off from him.But give credit to Ed on this. This was a genuine attempt at trying to be risque and his heart was really in this and you can tell that - it just didn't translate as well as it could have. His real life fiance Dolores is in this and well.....she's not exactly a great actress. But in some ways the script is just embarassingly naive on Ed's part that in some ways you just can't really believe in it at all no matter how much heart was put into this.Another thing you'll notice is the dubbing and it is pretty poor. There's a clear 1 and a half second delay on everyone's speech which can be amusing. In fact some people will be in hysterics and just take the piss out of itBut god bless Ed - he tried, honestly he tried

Buffalo Soldiers is going to be a movie which will unsettle all living patriotic Americans. Any film like this would be hailed as a stroke of genius but then September 11th 2001 halted this movie from it's original release date. As it stands it's a fine movie about the incompetency of the American army and the boredom the soldiers have as they have nothing to do. The only problem is.......do we have any sympathy for the characters at all? I found myself thinking that it was pointless because the characters show nothing to garner any sympathy.....and perhaps that's the point of the film. In that case it's good. But the whole joke about the army generals being inept is one that's very tiring and repetitive. I think the only person in this who gets any sympathy at all is the new soldier who came in thinking that what his father said " about army guys stick together " is given a bit of a shock when he gets beaten up really badly. An important lesson for those to say that you shouldn't always believe your own romantic illusions. They tend to be nothing but a figment of your imagination.As a film, Buffalo Soldiers is an interesting film, but is it really great? The answer is no. The problem with films like these is that will always suffer under films like it and that have been done before. Dr. Strangelove and Apocalypse Now will forever be the masters of the genre. Anything else seems to be tipping their hat towards them. They do have their moments of brilliance but they cover themselves inside a shell that in the end you've got a film that you've thought you've seen before in some other form and what this leaves you with no other optionIf you are very patriotic to the cause of the whole war on terrorism...you would be better off staying away from this film. It's not going to leave you with a pleasant memory of what your boys ( and girls ) are doing over there ( even though it is totally different in their contexts )

Although I rarely listen to this CD anymore - it's filled with good ideas ie Trent doesn't sing as much which is a bonus for me. Alright there are 2 in which he does but I can live with that. And on one of the tracks his vocals are garbled nonsense - excellent it suits him better that way! Now this is the way it should have been but what do I know says you the NIN fanatic.My favourites are the Happiness in Slavery Remix - dig that cool synth work! Throw This Away sounds too short ( which maybe a blessing ) and Screaming Slave which is the nearest to industrial Trent ever got - pure noise!But here is where my generosity ends towards NIN

This is a nice collection of songs that will go onto be criminally underrated and neglected by most Pink Floyd fans. A shame really because they're really nice. Reading some of the reviews I'm surprised that some people hate Richard Wright's songs - I thought they were pretty good. And as for Roger Waters' Julia Dream - it's a beautiful song that I can't understand why some fans nor even the band hate it. Having said that I wish that there were more rarities on this album but...ah I suppose that could never happen. Still they are out there somewhere

It does sound like that though doesn't it? You got to love to this album. From the echoed bass opening of One Of These Days to the 23 minute bonanza of Echoes ( is there some sort of concept I'm missing here?) the album is about as flawless as flawless can be. This has the rip roaring Echoes with the distorted voice telling you &quot; One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces &quot; which was about all the equipment they had at the time because it wasn't working. Novel idea for song that isn't it?A Pillow of Winds is a really romantic song from Waters - quite surprising given his later turns into a ranting socialite who's always angry with the government. Fearless is a great song that has the Liverpool fans ( this is soccer mind you ) chanting &quot; You'll Never Walk Alone &quot; which is beautiful....almost brings a tear to my eye ( well I am a Liverpool supporter you know ). San Tropez is probably the only song that still kinda holds onto the spirit of Syd a little with its quirky little rhymes. And Seamus ( &quot; that's the dog &quot; ) is just a bluesy song with a dog in the background. I wonder if this is the same dog that got used in the Animals album.....ah wellAnd now for Echoes! Some people look at it as a 3-4 minute song stretched out to over 23 minutes. Nonsense! Well yeah I suppose they do have a point but the amount of detours we get along the way is nothing less than fascinating. The musicianship is fascinating and I do like those birds/dolphins in the middle ( whichever it is ). A fantastic &quot;epic&quot; that really does wonders. Funny thing was when I heard this on my uncle's vinyl I was so impressed by this. Even when it was supposedly skipping it still sounded good ( I hardly knew that it was skipping ( is that a sign of a good record?)). Also when this was going through the demo pile, it was originally called &quot; The Return of The Son of Nothing.&quot; I don't know about you but that's an equally good name for the song tooIf you want my advice - I'd tell you to get this first. Nevermind The Wall, nevermind Dark Side of The Moon. Get this first. It has all the makings of a masterpiece but it doesn't because it didn't sell as many as those mentioned above. Bloody shame - some people don't know what they're missing!

You've heard the songs one way or the other, you know what to expect except that they redid the album so that it would sound better so.....? Do I need to say anymore. Shall I mention that I love On The Run and no matter how I want to say I hate this since it's so popular I just can't. It's infectious but I still retain that this album is not as good as Meddle and any of the ones before this - it's not even as good as Animals but it is still really good. In the end - you will buy this album and despite trying to hate it you will actually possibly begin to like it and well......maybe reviews for this album are a pointless thing after allOh and let's set the record straight.....they were not on drugs...if you thought that they were I'd hate to imagine your reaction to Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.....that really was a druggy album but it was because of Syd Barrett and not the rest of the band but that's a different story

The remastering job on this is truly amazing. The band have somehow managed to make the sound stronger and still find parts of music you wouldn't find elsewhere in the original remastering job. Alfa Matrix, their label for this venture, has said that the original remastering job was " 2D " and this new version you could hear in " 3D." While I wouldn't go so far as that, they do have a point in saying that. The extra track," He Runs Too Fast For Us " is a frenetic tune that deservedly ends this album ( well until the 3 secret tracks which were on the original remastering job )The second CD is just as good as it shows all the elements of Front 242's music and how it all came together. Occasionally the odd instrumental of a track on the first CD is annoying and the last 2 tracks are wholly unnecessary ( apart from the rounds of applause the tracks are just the same ) but other than that it provides essential listening. You may find the price a little steep ( $46 is a lot to part with ) but you shouldn't be disappointed with it.

This album is an underrated masterpiece . True it's not going to satisfy everyone but try listening to this with an open mind and you might be satisfied . Atom Heart Mother goes on for 26 minutes and is something of an adventure . If follows next and this is a more sombre yet paranoid tale of a person who feels that he has lost his mind . Summer 69 and Fat Old Sun pass through nicely and then that brings us to Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast which is basically Alan having his breakfast and the band tapes him having a conversation ( &quot; bacon , sausages , tomatoes .... marmalade ! I like marmalade &quot; ). This is a rather weird track but it's rather humourous as Alan siting what he has to do for the day and how he's got a bad back ( reality TV hounds might like this track ) and finally after all that he'll sign off with &quot; Well my 'ead's a blank &quot; which may happen to some listeners after they've listened to song .Definitely an album for hardcore Pink Floyd enthusiasts . If new you'd be better off starting with Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall as they are Pink Floyd at their most accessible . If you want to start straight off into their madness get Piper At The Gates Of Dawn as there may be more to catch for you there . Leave this for a while . Chances are you might be like Alan !

As you may have read people will tell you that this is either a criminally underrated masterpiece from the Floyd or the least enjoyable album from them, I tend to think of this album as a minor masterpiece. It's got a nice, quiet almost haunted feel to the album which I think is really nice but the music here is not Pink Floyd in a sense but the director of the film More - Barbet Scroeder.The band ( or more ( pun not intended ) to the point, Roger Waters ) had said that he was awful to work with. Waters claims &quot; We'd be putting up what we thought was this amazing song full of passion and he would come and say &quot; Eeeza good but eet's too emotional &quot; and then we'd think &quot; Well alright OK &quot; and we'd play the same thing again and he'd say &quot; Nowa eet's lost eet's integrity.&quot; It was hell working with him. Sheer and utter hell.&quot;So given that band were given instructions in how to get a damn track right I'm not surprised some might not agree with what finally came out but I think it works out rather well . Cirrus Minor is a nice gentle song that chirrups and tweets it's way into our minds. The Nile Song is a rather bad attempt at doing a fairly heavy song and the same goes for Ibiza Bar. Both are good songs but in the context of the way the songs are panned out not a very good idea.The one track that stands out to me is Quicksilver. The start of that song is like a demented fairground with it stopping and starting every so often but it turns into one of the most beautiful ( if creepy ) songs I have ever heard . A Spanish Piece is somehow hilarious as the Spanish guitars serenade us and if you listen very closely you hear someone mimicking a Spanish accent ( probably Dave Gilmour ) saying &quot; A bit of tequila.....I will keeelll you I teeheenk&quot; and &quot; senorita your eyes are glowing and your lips are like rubies&quot; Fairly humourous to hear and by then the Dramatic Theme raps it upOn the whole I have to say that this album is rather nice and very ambient. It may not be for everyone but it's well worth the listen.I recommended this album to a customer once in a job I used to have and they were impressed with what I thought of it that they bought the album so that made my day. Incidentally I've never seen the film. I'd like to but given that the reviews are more mixed than this album I think I'd rather have a loan of it before owning it

This album is scary . And I mean that . There is nothing more freaky than an incoherent rambling Scotsman yelling &quot; ne'er be fray shirly e tayk meee alie &quot; to the tune of some badgers and squirrels and mice squeaking in the background . And if you that's bad - most of the album is like that too .Now you're probably wondering why I give this 5 stars . Well because in some odd way the music is pretty darn funky . And in some cases they sound pretty modern ( that track included ). The live cuts of Careful With That Axe Eugene and Saucerful Of Secrets are genuinely scary and Sysyphus that Pict ( Scotsman ) track as well as The Grand Viziers Party are also unsettling . Dave Gilmour's contribution is OK but it's not something altogether excellent ( something which even he'll admit to )The band hate this album . It's not surprising really . But I think this album shows how they were feeling at the time and maybe that's something they'd rather forget . Enjoy it late at night on your headphones when everyone's asleep and be afraid .... be very afraid

This is very much Syd's album. The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is more whimsical than any of Pink Floyd's later albums. It seems only a shame that he didn't stay longer in the band or indeed make more solo albums. This is Syd in happy times. The drugs were in their joyous effect at this stage and he wrote songs such as Bike which is rather silly when you think about it but somehow rather much the work of a mad genius. But there is plenty to like about this albumif you are a curious old so and so. Astronomy Domine, Matilda Mother and The Gnome are all beautiful songs when you give them time . But the main track here is the near 10 minute version of Interstellar Overdrive and I think it's fair to say that the track lives up to it's name.Incidentally I once played this album when my friends had come over. They were smoking some hash and I played Interstellar Overdrive and Bike. Needless to say most people were in a state of paranoia and needed to get out of the room because the music was too much ... for them. All in all there were about 3 people including myself who were left listening to it. HilariousBut of course this is not going to please everybody. My dad ( who also likes Pink Floyd ) hates this album a lot. He can't stand the silliness of it all and prefers their later albums. This is not uncommon - a lot of people are divided over this album so it's no surprise to me at all. If you heard Bike at the end of the Echoes album should probably get a fair idea if you want the album or not. I say buy it even just to see how Pink Floyd started out or just to see how out of his mind Syd was when he made this album. Either way it should be at least listened to once or twice-by then you should get a clear idea whether this album is for you or not

This is the last album before Dark Side of The Moon and the last soundtrack that they had made. It's often unfairly overlooked because Dark Side of The Moon came next and....well you know the whole story with Dark Side of The Moon. But this album should be given greater credit than it is given. The band finally get to grips with the machines that they had been trying to mastering since 1967....and while those albums are brilliant in their own way, they still gave you the feeling that they were haunted by Syd, musically. They always were haunted by Syd of course, but pre-Dark Side seemed to show it even more. It was only by the time Meddle had arrived that they were beginning to shift musically and were beginning a more settled patch.From the start of the album, the album sees a band more confident in their abilities. The songwriting is more assured although perhaps missing some of the quirks that made some of their earlier albums a bit more fun ( I use that term loosely, some people might not see it ). But the quality of the music cannot be faulted.....as I've said it is more assured, more powerful and while not quite forceful, it certainly doesn't descend into mania like what would've happened earlier. It's the first time where you really sense they've learned to control themselves without hampering the music. It's also quite pastoral too which is quite welcome.Having said all this, it still strikes me as an odd album for a soundtrack because if you take away the fact that it was a soundtrack this would be a very decent rock album. Having seen the film, it underused many of the tracks and does the music a disservice I feel. But then that's not the point really is it? The film's not much really....but it would be a crime to forget about this album because it's not Dark Side of The Moon or it was the one before. If you want the big picture you've got to look at the finer details that went on beforehand.

This is a brilliant album full of stunning ambience and faster, moodier tracks but those moodier tracks are still danceable as can be.I say this is phase 3 because the first phase was experimental and had Chris Watson. Phase two was the same only without Watson and this was the new somewhat lighter sounding Cabs but still just as intenseAs a prototype to techno music this CD has it all and must really be listened to in order to appreciate it

2046 is a marvellous about love and the feelings that remain even when love is gone. But within this we have the dealings of what 2046 which is a novel being written. While the focus is of love within that novel, we are set in this hyper-futuristic tale that characters travel to the future to regain lost memories.It's a story that is fascinating both inside and outside of the novel that is being made. One that shows that people as a whole, don't like change. They have problems with moving on and perhaps in their hearts have always lost the ones they really loved. And as is the way with things, people try to get along with their lives whether they fully realize this or not. In a sense they want to go back to how things were before because they might want to recapture that spark the relationship once had or recapture the youth they once had as they feel themselves getting older and closer to their inevitable demise.But before I make this sound like it's one of those depressing love stories to rival the likes of Verhoeven's adaptation of Jan Wolkers' Turkish Delight, I should tell them to relax, it's not like that at all. It has it's bittersweet melancholy but the tone is more wistful, than the overbearing suffocation of Turkish Delight. In locating it in Hong Kong of the 1960s, it shows that Hong Kong was still a thing of beauty and still ahead of it's time. In many respects, it's architecture is something some of the developed countries still aspire to and have been playing catch up ever since.But it's the scenes of the future, or the future imagined for the novel that's been written which really captivates the eye. The colours, the textures make this film glorious viewing for the viewer. I can't even begin to describe, how intricate and how colourful it really looks.....I'd almost say it takes on a life of it's own. To call it spectacular is to do it an injustice - it's so much more than that!All the actor's play their part extremely well in this gorgeous movie. Really, there can't be too much more said about such a beautiful movie. Watch and enjoy!

OK they were always funky in a certain way but Paul's Boutique upped the ante in terms of the funk . Hey Ladies is a masterpiece which is frankly irresistable and it proves that way with all of the album given time . I'm surprised that this album was a flop at the time but then I can understand why now .... with Licensed to Ill it was immediate and had what everyone wanted .... Paul's Boutique didn't .... it was too arty-farty . But then it became a dormant success and rightly so ..... this album I feel is probably more important than Licensed To Ill as it shows that The Beasties where more than just a flash in the panSeriously recommended

This was one of the first CDs I got of Covenant ( the other was Europa which came in a package that was a lot cheaper where I was than what Amazon has here )Anyway what I'll say is that the sound is good even though the Cryotank track will have some people being impatient since it goes on for almost 26 minutes but it isn't bad - it's quite good really. Another thing is that the singer sounds like Phil Oakey of the Human League and it sometimes fun to think of the Human League Mk1 singing songs like these and Covenant singing the Human League`s back catalogue

As soon as the opening credits roll ( or collapse rather ), you know you're in for something. At the start you don't understand what's going on because the camera is shaking all over the place and you can't make out who's who and why there's so much arguing and fighting. Persevere and you begin to understand why, the camera steadies and a natural storyline begins to come to the fore.Realizing that his wife has been badly beaten up, one guy and his friend try to find out who took out this atrocity. Hence the shaky camera can be described as " blind with rage." It's interestingly done. You'll soon find out that the movie goes backwards ( seems to be the fashion these days ) in finding out how this all came about. So in order to find out how this works you have to go backwards to go forwards.We find out more about the trio the more we dig into the film. And it also brings to mind how people change completely after someone close to them has been assaulted. The uncontrollable rage that eats inside them. In a way, the fact this film goes backwards reminds you that when you ask someone who has lived with this trauma, they will often speak of their wish to go back to how it was before and how they wish they could turn back the hands of time. People also don't realize that this can last for a long, long time. They simply cannot be the person they used to be. And as a result this film portrays that excellently.However, it's not a film that can be watched lightly. This can be brutal stuff as it's unrelenting realism when it pictures would make anyone wince. I will wilfully admit that the centrepiece of the movie ( if you can call it that ) was Monica Belucci's rape scene. So brutal and ugly was it that I practically had to skip whatever was the chapter. Watching what I did, I could feel every kick and every beating that was given and I just winced and looked away. It was that brutal.A film that will only test the bravest souls. It's not for the squeamish. To be quite honest, it's a hard film to recommend but it's something that must be given respect in terms of the sheer audacity to make a film like this. However if you want realism in your movies then I think this must be the film for you. Just be careful you don't get any nightmares. Or worse still, if it happens to you.......

On this release of early tracks from around Kollaps era Neubauten what's interesting is that it is nowhere near as noisy as Kollaps. Not even close. Granted it's still your standard Neubauten from that era - harsh, abrasive, aggressive and at times creepy. But it's nowhere near brain meltdown as Kollaps.The tracks however do tend to creep and crawl under your skin. It's almost like you were being locked in a room with while being poisoned with gas that's filling up the room in a cloud. Tracks such as Zuckendes Fleisch ( German for "Twitching Meat") and Bakterien Fuer Eure Seele ( Bacteria For Your Soul ) are prime examples of that. The two last tracks Thirsty Animal and Durstiges Tier should viewed as one of the same since they both mean the same thing. To me it's almost like a soundtrack to a chemical nuclear explosion and the lyrics by Lydia Lunch describe the gruesomeness of the survival of what's left of the inhabitants. I never said it was cheery stuff!If you are new to Neubauten you would be well off starting with later records. The Strategies compilations are ideal and essential purchases and give you a taste of Neubauten.....leave this one until a little later unless you're a hardened pro at noise records. Then just step inside.....

This album is a mess. It seems to have no idea about what it wants to be. Shall we prog it but keep it real with the punk and shall we go salsa with the tango and sing in Spanish about rotting maggots in our brains while having tuneless guitars but yet quiet electronic moments with found sound bird noises and oh you know how Neu! and the Butthole Surfers did those part of their records with the tapes speeded up and distorted....yeah let's do them. Come on guys, show that you at least know what you're doing ( even when you don't ). I laughed when I first heard this. The whole thing was so comical, I just couldn't take it seriously. But, like all jokes, play it one too many times and it starts to really wear thin. The one thing that astounds me is how there is the Vismund Cygnus "suite" shall we say. It clocks in at over 45 minutes and is bloody tiring too. It takes all the clich&eacute;s of prog into overdrive and then some. Normally I would have used that as a compliment but not here. It's just so sounds so misplaced. Sure it has all the heart and parts of it I did like particularly the quieter sections where they actually did sound interesting but it was ruined by wanky tuneless " look-at-me-ain't-I-a-god-damn-virtuoso-of-this-here-guitar" playing that and the singer singing in tune to a different song in his head. It was so heartbreakingly hilarious but then it was tiresome to hear it for 78 minutes and there's nothing. There's not much variation. Sure there are those moments of quiet and tape manipulation ( which goes on way too long ), but it becomes so mind numbingly tedious set in a pattern that it's just a painfully laborious thing just to get to the end of the CD.In short, you'd either have to be a rabid fan of the band or just plain stupid to believe the hype around these guys. It's so mind numbingly tedious that you end up thinking record executives should be shot for allowing this mess out to the general public. Or you could like this record........

Some of these tracks are great but then they're mixed with some that could be better. It could have been better there's no doubt about that but perhaps with a different show or if they hadn't rush released this CD as a &quot; limited &quot; release ( I still see it in the shops though )One for the fans really

This was my second purchase and this I have to say this was an interesting listen. It was like going on some small journey. Excuse me if I sound like I'm being really pretentious but while listening to this album I kinda felt there was this mini-movie running in my head that would probably be interesting only to myself. Seeing snow-blizzard like conditions, strange new things that I had never seen before and it felt strange, voyeuristic and above all new. Amazing how modern technology/machinery can make you feel such emotions. One for the most adventurous of listeners.

This used to be the record I'd play when I was very young. I loved The Prodigy to bits. I wanted every record they had. Albums/singles...you name it - I wanted it.I recently got another copy since my other copy was scratched. It still sounds so good. It does give me a weird nostalgia trip listening to this and I don't know why. It still sounds fresh today which is amazing given techno's everchanging culture. It's worth the money if you are interested.The Narcotic Suite seems pretty much self explanatory. 3 Kilos is probably about getting stoned, Skylined is another term for being wired and Claustrophobic String is about the paranoia of the comedown I think. I never took any drugs ( well apart from one big puff on a joint ) but I know some of the feelings pretty wellI should probably stop now.....this album always makes me feel giddy.....don't ask me why

Everybody harps about this film being a modern classic and how rapturous they are about Tarantino's work. They'll look at you as a complete weirdo for not seeing this " masterpiece " and will end up telling you the whole thing scene by scene. Crack up, laugh at hilarious it seems. I've watched the movie once and I've never been more bored in all my life. If this was the pinnacle of 90s film-making then I'm glad I didn't see it when it came out ( I'm glad I was too young ). It's boring, sleep-inducing and not one bit funny save one scene from Christopher Walken. It's also rather empty which is not how I like films to be. It also feels like Tarantino just cutting everything he loved about the type of movies he loved and then pasted them together with nothing original to show for it. Oh the post modern touch - it's so original! Correction it's pathetic. Having tried to watch some of the other stuff he's directed I can't help but think that he makes really shallow films. They all seem to follow a set pattern which is extremely infuriating. Oh well, here's to mediocrity with high levels of boasting - gets you far in this world.

Goes through all the favourites and gives a few bonuses as well but I have to say that the version of Bela Lugosi Is Dead is not half as good as the one on Press The Eject And Give Me The Tape. That one has a more claustrophobic nature to it. As for the cover version of the Dead Can Dance song - it's good but I would prefer to hear the original

Can't really say much more. When I first watched this the start of it made me laugh.....don't know why but it just did. There was a scene in it where Rutger Hauer says he's better than Jesus ( in the bedroom ) but come the second half of the movie, the film is ultra depressing and you'd have to have a heart made of stone not to be a little emotional. The thing is is that it feels so real what's going on that it's hard remembering that it's only a film. For weeks I couldn't get this out of my head and even now I'm a little reluctant to put it back in because the film although I haven't seen it since I bought it but there are parts in the film I can remember too well. When Erik ( Hauer ) brings home another girl that was prime for the bed there's the statue of Olga ( the amazingly beautiful Monique Van de Ven ) and for a split second Hauer thinks he sees Olga in the flesh until the girl turns the light on and sees that it was just the statue. It's enough to turn off Erik's passion for sex in an instant. It's truly chilling when you see it again ( OK I admit I tried watching it again but just couldn't after I saw that scene )The love that Erik has for Olga is beyond intense. He's so obsessed that he cannot bear to see her with another man. And like Erik this is the sort of film that transcends that message across to the viewer. Some relationships that have broken up can still have the " we can still be friends " and can happily go on but for the others they may not want to go through the pain again knowing the things they know. It's my opinion that in some respects this movie could also leave you ending up one or the other

They say horror movies are a test of your wits and your endurance .... and this movie does that .... but not in the way they may have intended it to be . The acting is so diabolical you begin to wonder why the hell did you put your money to waste on a movie like this . The acting is so hilariously bad that when friends and family interrupt and start talking about &quot; think I ought to mow the lawn tomorrow , what do you think dear &quot; you gladly give your opinion just so you can get away from the terrible film .Now when you think of a George Romero film you think &quot; Oh this might be good &quot; because of such classics as The Living Dead trilogy and Code Name Trixie ( The Crazies to you and me ) and the amiable Bruiser . But then this just really tears your heart out . Again I go back to the acting and how poor it is but you've just got to see it to believe it . I mean how do these &quot; actors &quot; ( I use the term loosely ) sleep at night knowing they made a turkey like this . Actually I'm being cruel - turkeys have better taste than to watch this tripeAvoid at all costs - Please I beg you don't submit yourself to this torture

This is one of those dadaist jokes the band had pulled to an unsuspecting public back in 1980. What's noticeable is that there are only two tracks or &quot; mantras &quot; on the CD and to confuse things even more &quot; Eastern Mantra &quot; sounds very Western and vice versa. The art of confusion was never perfected better ( except perhaps for Throbbing Gristle who were always joking ). There's a cryptic warning for us as well with the most noticeable lyric in the whole album which is &quot; Symptom of a signal soon to be exhausted. &quot; Perhaps a subtle warning - but nothing more.....As it stands this sounds like a closing off chapter for the Cabs. Their first 2 albums were typical of industrial at the time but the second track is an open embrace of something new. It's almost like a prototype for things to come. Without it there would be no Yashar....and perhaps there wouldn't be a Red Mecca....so in a way this is a band coming in at a crossroads beginning to venture onto new paths.This CD is probably one for the die hard Cabs fan as it is one of their more experimental of releases. But for those who want to jump into their more experimental approaches....or indeed love experimental music should enjoy the CD.

On one hand I feel repelled by this film and it's sick nature but then it's a film that reels me in no matter what. It must have done something considering I've bought the soundtrack and the book after I watched this film. So there must be some attraction to it but I just don't know how I can get sucked into this. No matter though it's definitely Cronenberg territory. The actors have an air of dehumanization about them. They feel quite numb which is how Ballard portrayed them in the novel so in that sense it's a success. Really the film is just sketches of the novel but you still get that same feeling from the film as you do in the novel. The soundtrack is creepy no matter what way you look at it and well....it's just a hard film to say you loveIncidentally Vaughan ( Elias Koteas ) is the major star in this. His bizarre fetish is what draws these people together. His mystical allure is what draws these people in and perhaps draws some of the audience in without them fully realizing it. No doubt Vaughan is a psycho but the characters are drawn nonetheless. However it is fun hearing him inform his crowd one time when he reinacts the James Dean crash ( " Don't worry that guy's gotta see us " ) and how he finds out Seagrave had caused a big car pile up on the roads ( " You done the Jayne Mansfield crash without me...and the dog....the dog is beautiful " )However there is one thing I'm glad Cronenberg didn't go too much into how Ballard first met his wife. If you read the book you're getting too much information when you read thatNote to all: Buy this film and your friends will think you are some psychotic who likes messed up porn. I thought I'd just like to remind you of that because I now unfortunately have that burden to live with

What makes them so special? Does any one band deserve to be put on a pedestal? I'm not claiming to dismiss The Beatles although every time they play a song of theirs on the radio, I can't help but shudder at the awful production, the awful singing and.....well OK, I know " at the time" these songs were the thing to listen to but they've aged terribly. I just don't understand how there music has survived today. I've heard people comment on how fresh their songs sound and I completely disagree, they sound stale, irritating and in really bad quality. I would normally say " I suppose you had to be there " but this is The Beatles we're talking about. The band that everyone must shut up and like as it's an " education into everything music was," and think that you are the biggest fool who ever walked the Earth. I've heard plenty of their songs and they presented the worst ideas I've heard for music.Of course, people will point out that if you don't like The Beatles, you don't like pop music. That's not strictly true, I generally like all music and I can see that somewhere along the line The Beatles have helped contribute in some respects, but their songs are pathetic themselves. It's just a standard routine that people love to build a band up to such huge proportions to be something that they are not. Ultimately I know that writing this is a useless cause because, admittedly, there are very few people who would go out and say they hate The Beatles. So obviously, if you are already a fan of The Beatles, you'll disagree with how I could hate the music of the band. All I'm saying is, is that I disagree that they were an ordinary band, nothing special, nothing of the greatness that people usually talk of when regarding The Beatles, but of course that's simply not acceptable, we're supposed to be programmed to like them.

With an arabian twist to the usual French pop sensibilities and fine vocals the effect is a subtly seductively exotic album filled with delights. It's almost like Ferrero Rocher ( I don't know if you guys get them ) but you feel as if &quot; you're really spoiling us &quot; with this collection. This has to go down as a first rate tribute to the great Serge Gainsbourg and also a first rate live album too. A must have for those interested in something different and are not bothered by a different language

This was a great film although overlooked on release. The acting is superb from all of the actors and although there is one little minor change in the movie....the film stays mainly faithful to the book. If I could give anyone any advice on this though...Do NOT watch this film when you are drunk....you might end up blubbering like a baby by the time it's finished. Also I have to say it has a great soundtrack. Makes you really fit in with the time of when it was supposed to be set.Watch and enjoy

Paul Van Dyk was pretty much THE DJ at the end of the last millenium with his set at the Berlin Love Parade and with tunes ( sorry choooooons ) such as For An Angel, he just couldn't go wrong at all. This DJ set has that song here included as well as some crowd favourites and some slightly more obscure selections but nonetheless pumping chooooons guaranteed to get your groove on for a Saturday night rave.Enjoy and remember you gotta keep on dancing with this set. It might sound unpopular to quote Michael Jackson but " don't stop til you get enough."

This album is very harsh and an uneasy listen . Some of the tracks are very short but the main focus point of this album is Frankie Machine . This is perhaps the harshest of the lot where it has a sample of one guy asking Frankie for a cigarette which then turns into a brawl . It might take a couple of listens but it'll be worth it

Jean Michel Jarre is an artist who gets ridiculed by some people in the music industry . It is unfair of them to think that because much of his material is outstanding and truly moving . This CD is no exception . Although having said that you can see why people tend to criticize him on this album . There is a couple of tracks on it where they don't get the imagination going and in the case of part 5 , it is an utter joke .... a horrible mess that sounds like it was played on some kid's toy piano . But other than that the album is very good but I would advise you to start elsewhere if you are thinking of buying a Jean Michel Jarre album

This song ( I say song because I'm reviewing En Attendant Cousteau only ). Now I know 47 minutes seems a bit much for some songs to go on for but it really is nice . Sit back , relax , put your feet up and unwind to this . Think of yourself as an adventurer sailing the seas in a cold , damp night where there is only you to navigate where the ship is going . It's terrificAs for the other three songs .... they're OK but they're not particularly memorable . They might be better suited to a live video ( which they were )

This remains a stunning document of electronic music when at it's best. Needs to be listened to be appreciated - that's all. There's no need in the question of artistic integrity because it instantly draws you and funnily enough without trying to sound pretensious - gives you all the air you need! Blends as a whole although tracks 2 and 4 stand out since you might have heard them just about everywhere. Track 4 particularly for me since I remember there was this machine that would give you teddy bears and it would play the lead melody from that song.I give it 5 stars even if the length of the album ( 39 minutes )wouldn't usually be enough to part such an amount of money on. But this is an exception

This is a lovely album for which words can not be expressed deeply enough from the start of Theme 1 to Back Door the album just cries genius !From the sound of the album it feels like a break up in a relationship and the feelings of sorrow . There's a feeling of no ending in this album . Perhaps this can be due to the fact that there is no end to the pain that people suffer and this album expresses it beautifullyIf you are thinking of buying it I would recommend it instantly . And may you lose yourself in it's ethereal beauty

What can I say about this album. It's stunning, it's elegant and it's really a joy to listen to ( you probably thought for a minute there I was talking about her and not her music!)!You have a fascinating little biography from Bob Stanley on her who speaks of her as a fan of her music and well what more can I say really. You need to hear this album and I mean thatOh I should mention one thing is that I'm glad that these songs are all sung in French. It gives the songs a dimension of sensuality which I don't find in many English/American singers

This is supposedly a marked comeback as they reintroduced Clan of to their name and a damn good album it is . From the crashing Out Of The Rain to the haunting Wailing Wall and Piano Piece to The Story Ends this is one of the best Xymox release and is much better than the follow up Creatures which while good can be a little too much at times and be somewhat over the top . Nevertheless it is fantastic to see a great band as good as this still going strong .

The tales that Aidan Moffat says here are so heart-breakingly pathetic yet hilarious at the same time you don't know whether to feel sorry for him or think if he's being a stand up comedian. Of course this wouldn't mean anything if the music weren't as good as it was. Beautiful, shimmering guitars abound this album and it's kinda lovely in it's own pathetic misery. Indeed this is probably the best introduction to Arab Strap around and also a good companion for those lonely nights in bed to cheer you up and quietly celebrate your own misery ( even when it does get a bit noisy.)

The music seems very haunted. Aphex's more ambient textures mixed into the heavy hitting techno terrain make this a strange listen. It doesn't really sound dated......just a bit outside of time really. Very dislocated - almost like the guy surfing out on seashore on his own at the back of the cover ( you'll notice him - he's practically circled around ).All in all, I can't think of anyone else who would make this sort of album. It is ( without wanting to make a pun ) totally out on it's own.

It's like being stuck in some dreamland and is pure magnificence. And yeah OK, it's their most accessible CD to date but does that make it bad? No of course not, it should be enjoyed for what it is and the time that it was made ( 1991-93 ) it has aged gracefully instead of many of the rave anthems at the time. It could be said that even people who hate Autechre will like this since it doesn't get overly complicated like on later albums.

This is as odd as you can get from Richard H Kirk.....known for his paranoid music filled with Cabaret Voltaire and in his early solo recordings.....this record feels rather subdued yet strangely addictive. A work of genius that it is that he can do this but you still feel ( or perhaps yearn ) for something more abrasive and paranoid. Nonetheless this is truly something something special.....just don't think it'll be in the Cabaret Voltaire style of things

I bought this a few years ago as this was a record that was a classic of it's genre and I was led to believe that if I liked Aphex Twin and The Orb then I would love this. And I have to say I'm not won over with this.I've played this many times and each time I play it I'm left unimpressed by it all. Sure a lot of craft must've gone into this. But it all seems so nothing-y that I'm expecting a little more substance from it. The sounds have absolutely no form to it. You can talk about this album in almost an amoeba like context - it's practically invisible, it duplicates itself countless times but not a lot else can be said about it!If you like things that aimlessly go astray then this is the CD for you. If however you want something with a little more substance than try almost anything else - it's bound to get you going.

This is a good album by Bowie - disguising the past he had with Tin Machine fairly well ( although some are still scarred by the memory ). The set here is competent but by no means classic. It certainly falters a bit and that Morrissey cover is just awful but I'm getting used to it. The second CD doesn't really get started until the fourth track - the first 3 are OK but aren't special but the remixes add a new light on the album and perhaps seem a suggestion towards making albums like Earthling ( still something I'd rather not hear ). The DVD here though may seem pretensious to some but I think it was interesting. I didn't have a problem with the conversation going all over the place - I knew how to seperate one from the otherI'm surprised that when this was reissued it didn't come up with the single CD version like it has in the rest of Europe - wonder if something up with the distributers. But it is essential for any Bowie fan but perhaps they'd just want the one CD instead of the extras. Whatever the choice they shouldn't be disappointed once they don't expect a stellar classic - it's good but it's not that good!

This album is a more accessible sibling to the all out intensity that was In The Flat Field. At times though the humour is even more sillier with Lillies and Remains which is as deadpan as it got. There's the track where they all get their go at writing something without seeing what the other did and this is where the hilarity kicks in. Listening to Peter Murphy tell you " this is how you make fishcakes" is possibly the most hilarious thing I've ever heard. Although there is one where I'm wondering if they were [messing with] the listener when they recorded the song Ear Wax. It sounds bloody scary and I wonder if they were doing this as a joke - the mind bogglesHowever if you enjoy serious music but can stand a joke or two then this is the album for you

That's one thing that amazes me about this band, the tracks seem so catchy that when you sing along to it in your head you kinda wonder how the hell they made it that catchy and also how they made completely mind-bogglingly complex music so catchy. It just doesn't add up really but then.....Gong aren't a normal band by any stretch of the imagination. Just one look at the track names should tell you that much. It's amazing that they can branch out in all different manners of music eg jazz, rock, pop etc. and still tie it within the same song. A real touch of class that. Crafty gits they are, and well worth the money you spend on this.

A family's retreat is turned upside down when two thugs crash into their lives and torment them for the rest of the film. It begins innocuously enough but gets more sinister by the moment.I won't detail their torture because that would give the game away really. The film seems to be a bit of a nudge-nudge wink-wink joke which plays the viewer on as if to say " Hey guys, it's really just a film. The way one of the thugs winks at the camera or just talks to the viewer as if to ask for our opinion as to what would we do in that situation. It's clever but yet it also reminds you of Saved By The Bell and Parker Lewis Can't Lose in how they'd talk to the camera as to involve you in the whole scene. However it's done to extremes here. But that's Haneke would have wanted it!The film is not cheery, you will not get a happy ending and it is a sort of endurance test in to how much you can tolerate. In that respect it works like a horror movie. But this is not really a horror movie. It takes on psychological aspects which you don't get with cheap frights which give you a thrill. This is pure terror. OK there is one scene where you might cheer but that is quickly rewound to give further evidence that this is just a film.Another point I'd like to make is the heavy metal song used, it has to be the most unstructured metal song I have ever heard. But on a more serious note, does Haneke imply all these thugs who carry out these horrific crimes in real life, listen to heavy metal music? That's a sort of lazy stereotype to trot out that's been bandied about by the media to create unease. In that sense I'm a little disappointed but really that's only minor when such a movie is made to grip you by the throat and force you into submission.This film has no stylized violence that you would normally get. This is the real deal. It is brutal and it is unfriendly at best. Most of all it sets out what it wants to do - to shock people by the sheer brutality of mankind. It may be a touch stereotypical but then, that's not the point of the film. If you want realism in your films, no matter what the circumstances.....this is the one for you.

While I am a Blur fan I just cannot listen to this drivel. It's picked up this cult status among Blur fans as it's the heart-rendering story of Damon Albarn's break up with then girlfriend and lead singer of Wire rip-offs Elastica, Justine Frischmann. 13 is a document of that break up and my god it's useless self indulgence. Mindless even.First we'll start off with the singles.Tender - a plodding gospel song that goes nowhere and proves that Damon just can't hack it when it comes to soul no matter how much he protests. Long winded and uninterestingCoffee & TV - While I marvel at the video, I do think that that takes away from the fact that this song is very ordinary and nothing at all special. It does feature one of Graham Coxon's more agreeable vocals and goes by fine enough.No Distance Left To Run - Awful. Just plain awful. It never deserved to be a single. It should never have been a single. The lyrics are the most embarrassing I have ever listened to and Damon's voice is just off beyond all point. Although I'm sure those who love this album will point out that it's supposed to represent the pain he's going through. It just doesn't work.As for the rest of the album it just a horrible mess of styles thrown together to make it sound like they've been listening to the coolest albums around and that America's underground is really cool which is ironic given that this band originally wanted to go against all that.People say that Blur is Graham's album and this is 13's album and while I'm not so sure I'd label Blur Graham's album I can definitely agree with 13 being Damon's album. It's completely self-absorbed and the music is secondary to the theme of the album which in my book is never a good thing.However there are a couple of good songs. BLUREMI and 1992 are toetappers and the often underrated Optigan 1. Poor Optigan 1. The Optigan is one of the more fascinating instruments and has a gently surreal yet antique way of sound. It's a credit that this was made. Yet it goes almost unnoticed by many because " Oh it's just an instrumental." A shame that, because it sounds like everything this album is trying to be; emotional, warm, hurt.But most of the tracks here are surrounded in half thought-out ideas, lazily produced songs and in the case of Trimm Trabb, nicking the opening riff of Wined and Dined by Syd Barrett. I once said that this album was a poor man's Bad Moon Rising ( by Sonic Youth ) and by god I stick to that statement. While that album had oozing soundscapes, inventive lyrics and a sense of adventure even in dealing with some similar viewpoints ( although not all )......this feels completely lazy, lyrics depressed 15 year olds would laugh at, music that doesn't really do much and not a lot much else. It's painful to say that this is the same band who an album beforehand made something that was a stroke of genius. This however is not the answer though.Buy this if you are in love with Damon's ego. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and buy other Blur albums ( other than The Great Escape and Leisure ) or better yet buy Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising. Beats the hell out of this crap

To think that it is nearly 10 years since this was released is incredible. I remember being freaked out by the Da Funk video with the talking dog and the video for Around The World was a clever piece of videowork. But anyway, it's incredible to think that after nearly a decade in circulation, it has aged well.Despite, the previous two that I mentioned ( which have gone on to be dancefloor classics ), the rest of the album is just as good with particular mentions to Indo Silver Club and Alive. Alive in particular, sounds very claustrophobic. Really gets you going. Still worth it after all these years.

Again Ballard is perverting our perceptions of life. You can either see that as a good thing or a bad thing. It's not an easy book to read. In fact at some times you may end up feeling frustrated with the book but if you persevere with it it'll be alright...once you have his notes explaining the book to you but even then he still leaves you to think about the nature of what it is all aboutWhat I think the book is about is the whole cult of celebrity fame and the ever narrowing medical definition of it's conditions. What we see is that today's world is leading us to be dehumanized neurotic people with dangerous and repressed fetishes. Again the contents of Crash appear hear but in prequel form. He was only starting out his ideas of Vaughan's crazed nature and so on. There is also the reinactment of many of the car crashes such as JFK and Elizabeth Taylor and so on.They say the book is experimental in it's approach. I'm not much of a book hound so I don't know what the hell they mean but it certainly one which is different in it's topical approach. Perhaps it could be said that it is experimental because it kinda reads as a magazine - a sort of doctor's journal where even the doctors are as insane as you are. You can read any part of it that you like and go over it again and again to suit your fancy. But it still holds out an enigma that will not make itself clearFrustrating and not altogether enjoyable but it's a book that gets you thinking and makes you wonder - How messed up are we?

This film by George Romero is a fantastically tense movie about when the water supply becomes contaminated and it affects the town that relies on the water supply.The opening scene is quite possibly one of the most horrific I have ever seen. A brother is trying spook his sister out and his sister doesn't like it. She goes to tell mommy while the boy finds out that dad has gone mad pouring kerosene all over the house. The little girl is still trying to wake mommy up when she pulls the sheet off to find that mommy has an axe in her neck! Soon enough dad has set the house on fire and is outside while the rest of his family are left to burn.The scenes with governmental agencies are complicated. Nobody understands anything, everybody is at each others throats and the main line which illustrates this all is when one doctor incensed by the lack of control he is allowed on this is &quot; I cannot believe how shoddy this has been organized &quot;The mayhem in this movie doesn't let up. What with priests setting themselves on fire and a granny stabbing an army soldier with a knitting needle ( genuinely frightening and perhaps one of the most surprising scenes of all )The end will definitely leave you confused but I won't say too much more. I've given enoughIncidentally I'm surprised this flopped at the box office. It really is a good intelligent horror movie. But then I guess when people think of horror movies they tend to think of those big dumb Hollywood horror movies with absolutely no shock value whatsoever ( &quot; it's all gore they want &quot; ). Yes this film is graphic in places but is done so with more thought and precise control even when it's method is in chaos. And also I can't believe this is the same director who gave us the atrocious Creepshow 1 &amp; 2! What was Georgie thinking?

EP7 was originally released in two parts but has been put together for our enjoyment and well it takes a bit of getting used to that's for sure! Guzzling, clicky, fizzy computers that at first will only make itself heard better on computers since ( it seems ) that there are encoded sounds that will let itself be known to computers. It's not exactly easy listening for people - in fact people who like Merzbow might enjoy this more than those who liked Incunabula or Amber. But with repeated listening the songs come together and it proves that for all the probing and prodding and poking that Autechre do to the wires of their computer systems, the music comes out in the end. Well worth the slog in the end but don't expect something instantly accessible

First off this is the Neubauten approved release as you'll see from the Potomak label. It is very important that you know this as there have been dodgy dealings in the past that still happen as of today. Beware of the imitations as these will go directly to the record company and not the band. The record company or Stevo was a very corrupt man and took all the money while giving the band absolutely nothing. Hopefully this will not go on any further but beware of any dirty tricks that may sneak up on the unsuspecting buyer.For those that are only just getting into Neubauten the above warning should kept in mind. You do want to support the artist don't you? Hell if you're not keen on CDs you can download at Neubauten's website....it might cost a little bit but.....it's better than buying from Stevo.

Well I won't deny that that was what I bought this album for. Infectious, catchy and well, what the hell are those lyrics all about anyway? Still the rest of the album is pretty good however there may be a question over the sense of flow of the album it still is good purchase. I have to say I do like Soulsuckin' Jerk probably from past experiences or not, I don't know. All I will say is that it is worth a listen and even if you bought it just for Loser, it ain't bad.

By now you have all heard about the infamous exploding head scene. I actually never heard of this because all I was interested at the time was that it was a Cronenberg film and thought it would be worth a go. It was a great purchase!The whole idea of the film is that there are scanners in this world who can read people's minds and if they don't like what they hear they kill them! I have a feeling some people would love that power. The scanners can be either &quot; self destructive or simply destructive.&quot; I'll admit the acting here at times can be wooden but I think there's a need for Cronenberg to have his characters perform wooden acting. It enhances the view that these socially inept scanners are all dehumanized humans who don't know how to survive in this world.By the way I must mention the soundtrack here. This has got to be the most insane thing I've ever heard. It's as out there as you can possibly get. I don't know how they managed to get it the way it is but I really like it. I only wish they released it on CD because I'd love to listen to this more and moreThe ending must be intentionally meant to confuse people. I've seen this about 10 times or so and I still don't know what they meant by &quot; It's alright - we've won! &quot; Who's won - I don't understand. Am I missing a scene from the film? That could be true since the censors where I lived in Ireland are notoriously picky about some scenes and would edit them out. Then again I don't know if there was an uncut edition in the first place! Even still I'd probably still be left confused by it allAnyway as Cronenberg movies go this is an essential purchase! It's intelligently done and well worth seeing

I don't own the CD because as far as I'm concerned CD 1 is an absolute mess. But then bear in mind I wouldn't class myself as an Alec Empire fan because there are those CDs ( like CD1 ) which really do nothing but cause migraines and headaches. Saying this however will make people look down on me and have this superior attitude towards me because they'll think " I just don't understand art " or some[thing] like that. All I will say is that to my ears it's a bloody racket and that's that! Still go ahead if you want to be feeling like you could puke up blood and have a wiry taste in your mouthCD2 however I got taped from my girlfriend is much better ( incidentally she hates that CD but prefers CD1 - well we always have our differences ;) ) and I found this to be much better. The music is much better and although at times it lapses into "abstract freeform" ( just random noodles without any beat ) the music is much more to my liking.Then again I suppose this is the charm of listening to Alec Empire and his schizophrenic back catalogue. You never know what you're going to get ( touch of the Forrest Gump there ). It's only a matter of taste to see which side you like the most. I come out on CD2 but there are many people who wouldn't agree with me. I put it down to my dislike for anything resembling current rock music and since CD1 shows that along with fusing it with gabba and industrial.....it only serves to make that headache worseWell I don't know if this review will win over any friends but this is my own personal opinion

I'm not a Kylie fan really but I just can't help but love this song as much as I hate admitting it ( but I'm doing so now ). I always say the best way to make yourself as an artist is by making records that are not instantly recognizable as your own. And this song proves it - I didn't know it was Kylie until the last 30 seconds of it on the radio. I was impressed. The gurgling synths do sound a bit like your old Atari console but I think it makes it seem all the more nifty. For some reason I see shades of Kraftwerk and Cabaret Voltaire in it.Never has a single by an artist that I don't particularly like ( music wise ( I mean everyone would watch her videos not matter how bad the song was )) has made me think on buying the album that's coming out.Well alright I've had a soft spot for Kylie and I guess she's the one pop star I wouldn't turn the radio off for

I'll be perfectly honest. Before getting this I was never a Bjork fan. Apart from Army of Me which I thought was great I wasn't sure what to think about her. And to any DJ who played It's Oh So Quiet just made me sick - that was a song that should never have been released but then it fitted with popular demand didn't itI came across this CD when in Germany and noticed in the booklet it said that she was very happy that the mixers used her songs as &quot; ingredients &quot; for their mixing desks. And I thought I might as well give it a go. I was hoping they would destroy her songs into pieces and make it completely unrecognizable from what it was. And I'm pretty sure that's what I got in some cases - so much so that it frightened me!Now I don't know whether this'll make me a diehard Bjork fan but I could happily enjoy this album for all it's worth and it's recommended to both fans and the interested parties

I'd agree though that if you already have all of these in their original format then by all means you've no real reason to go out and buy this ( unless you're a rabid collector ). If you're relatively new to XTC, go out and buy this immediately. Think of it this way, you're killing 4 birds with one stone. And at a reasonable price too.As for the music - well it is stunning but I need to give it more time to sink in with me.

Ah yes, The Wall. This, along with Dark Side Of The Moon, are what Pink Floyd are renowned for. These are possibly the two biggest sellers in the catalogue.You all know about this album so I won't go on any further with the history of the album. I like the album, not as much as some of the others I have but I wouldn't term it as Pink Floyd's best! Still the songs are good and they do generally blend in well with the concept at hand, ie. they tell perfectly Roger's problems dealing with being a rock star and again bits and pieces of Syd come into his thoughts. Whether how much of this is true I don't know ( that being the lyrical content). I like Another Brick....and Don't Leave Me Now although if I had have known it was about a rock star who wants his girl back so he can abuse her again I'm not quite sure if I'd have liked it - I just thought it was about being lonely - that's all!But anyway - this is The Wall and if you can get by it you're already on your way to enjoying the album. Oh yes and this seems to be an inspiration to many of today's rock stars. That I think could be a bad thing as well as a good thing but that's all I should say

This is the CD I started my Sonic Youth collection with ( why go for the original when you can have the deluxe edition ) and I have to say this stuff literally rocks. Neat little eccentric subversive style pop-rock with all the right twists and turns and the personal recordings are even better. Looking forward to the other deluxe reissues

I bought this just recently and I got quite a shock when I heard this. It wasn't like Wire's punky stuff or even their synthy stuff. It just sounded so alien and strange. Plus there was no beats which kinda gave it this world of it's own. I don't know why I found this in the world section because it could have easily be put in at the rock/pop section but that doesn't matter really. The music sounds haunted and Newman's vocals backed up by his wife Malka Spigel's rather ghostly vocals give up this rather spooky quality. I don't mean spooky in a &quot; give me the creeps &quot; sort of way - just a calm effect that you weren't expecting.The interview part is hilarious since Colin really has nothing to say and is talking &quot; virtual rubbish &quot; throughout the course of the interview. He says at one point &quot; I'm not getting paid for this. Maybe I should!&quot; and then we have the remix of the interview which has some things you might have missed out on from the original review. It's good fun and if you feel like joining in the fun you can always turn it off when Colin says for you to turn it off....but then you could always disobey

First off let's just say that in Love Like Blood they have made an incredible song that any band would give their lives to make. Agreeably catchy, it has all the right ingredients for a killer pop song ( and no the pun was not intended ).As for the rest of the album......well it has it's bad moments. Tabazan and Kings and Queens have some slightly embarrassing lyrics plus Jaz Coleman's overwrought frightened-at-what-the-world-has-become vocals can be more than a little tiring, it still offers a great slab of 80s new wave pop music.Without a shadow of a doubt this is one of Killing Joke's more commercial albums if not THE most commercial. Granted there are Brighter Than a Thousand Suns and the panned Outside The Gate ( which I have not had the mis/fortune of hearing so I cannot judge ) but this is Killing Joke at a crossroads: not as heavy as they were before, not too wishy washy. A sort of combination that happily sits inbetween.

This is a very paranoid album . The first time I listened to it it freaked me out but gradually within time I began to like it .The thing is though when you buy this album don't expect it to be some bombastic pop/rock record . This is dark, eerie and to some extent a very scary record to listen to . As one of the listeners said Veldt kinda sounds like some aquatic jungle .Now I still find new elements to the songs even though I've owned the album for close to a year and a half now .Well this is it's second stint because the last one got so badly scratched that I could only replace it when I went on holidays in Holland( it is a rare thing for me to rebuy an album after it has been scratched but this makes it all the more worth it ) . If you listen to it on your headphones there's things that make some of the songs even more menacing than what you thought once before . All in all making it a more and more appealing album .Listen to this if you want experimental music taken to it's most darkest of elements . If you're looking for looking for something a bit more warm however you could always try the fantastic New Gold Dream which has all of what Simple Minds would later become to be known better for ( without the bombast )

I was given this as a Christmas present and finished it within a couple of weeks. Whether you want to debate the whole issue of the link between Tony Blair and Britpop.....there are some links but they're not interconnected. It's true that Tony Blair ( or for the benefit of some Tony B(liar)) used the whole Britpop movement for political gain.....but that's only to be expected. He probably saw it as a calling from the disaffected nation of the youth ( if you've listened to him sometimes, he desperately wants to come across as a messiah ).However the political aspects always seem to loom in the background. In the 80s, Paul Weller and Billy Bragg popping up as part of the Red Wedge ( horrible name ), which was a sort of Labour tie-in at the time as " Musicians against the Tories " which admittedly is a good idea but never amounts to much in the end. It ended in failure.....just like now when Bruce Springsteen et al rocking to get Kerry in.....see something here musicians don't make much of a difference!It digs even deeper into Tony Blair's past when he used to be in a band and could do a striking Mick Jagger impersonation.....so no wonder Jagger got knighted! The 90s though was made up of new ideas. As the " baggy" movement died away and was superseded by America's grunge, various musicians ( Suede, Blur, Elastica etc. ) were thinking of something that was anti-grunge, that was gave themselves a British identity, " a sense of who we are " in a way. Steadily as it was built, the music press got more and more excited and had suddenly forgot about it's past politicking and other things and just forget everything and just be happy to be British and so on. To make this all the more clearer, in 1992, Morrissey was scorned upon for waving the Union Jack flag at one of his concerts. Within 3 years you were hailed as god for sleeping in a Union Jack duvet with your soon-to-be wife or play a Union Jack guitar in front of millions......well you get the drift of it. Funnily, the picture of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit lying underneath a Union Jack duvet was to be mocked by an Irish magazine called In Dublin, where they had lookalikes under an Irish quilt. I say funnily, but in some ways it was as grotesque as the real thing. That last bit's not in the book but also it will tell you that most ( if not all ) Americans did not get to see that because, hell, an interview with someone from Seinfeld is far more interesting.But rewind a little and we find that not only are the music press obsessed but so are the media which means a widespread cultural renaissance is in place. And while the general public are hastily looking for any little tidbit of information from their newspapers, we find that Blur and Oasis, who used to be at least friendly to each other, now go into a full on war for the number 1. The hysteria is palpable and duly enough Blur win and Oasis lose out.What also should be noted is that there is a growing tapped interest by the Labour Party which started in 1994 and which they have to be seen with the coolest thing on the block. First Blur, then eventually it's Oasis which Noel Gallagher was invited to Number 10 to sip champagne and hobnob with the new prime minister.And then everything seemed to go sourWith the whole Britpop ideal moving into more paranoid terms what with endless amount of hard drugs it seemed inevitable it would collapse. All the bands in heroin-stooped madness that all the creative juices just seem to curdle up and be spewed out like a really bad hangover. Everybody had moved on. If you were still playing Britpop by then you were sadly laughed at for jumping on the bandwagon while it had no wheels and was about to crash.And New Labour......well by then perhaps the idea that New Labour wasn't really worth all the hype had dawned on everyone and while there wasn't a case of hopes being dashed but......well they promised more didn't they?There is a hell of a lot more packed into this book that I'd run out of time and space trying to describe it for you. But to slim this down to an nutshell, to take from the song New Labour used as their party manifesto song from 1997 - D:Ream's Things Can Only Get Better. It was their promise to which the NME replied " Have you ever got the feeling you've been cheated "

But one you should be careful with. At times you may be reminded of a similar period in your life and sometimes that may not be too pleasant. In the end this book became Prozac for me - one chapter a day and one at night and for a while there it seemed like whenever my arms itched I wanted a razor to deal with them - but that should NEVER be encouraged - and well as I said this book really did become Prozac for me since you end up thinking crazy thoughts

I generally don't like Atari Teenage Riot and in some respects this is what kinda put me off buying this CD. A bit of a shame really since the music is really good and you can hear things more clearly unlike the general noise that goes with ATR and later Empire records. It may disappoint some of those who are really noise junkies - there's a bit more melody to it I suppose so you're luck is out on that style ( although Live at CBGB's is out now so you can always get that )Anyway, if you are a fan of Empire then buy this CD but count yourself out if you want pure noise - this ain't the CD for you

Well in actual fact this is probably an easier album to digest than the last album I bought of them - Mission of Dead Souls. The sound is much clearer and while the sound is still very much creepy, it doesn't feel quite so bad. Perhaps this is because Gen doesn't jibber-jabber about dead dogs walking under the car and whatnot. The sound that comes from the machines, synths and guitars sound like an apocalyptic future where the world has become a wasteland. Given how some people are bemoaning about the effects of global warming, you can almost picture the effects it will have in 10-15 years time. It certainly is ugly as it was intended to be but not completely grotesque which I suppose is part of the beauty of it. And therefore it perhaps destroys everything they went for by saying that. Still you've got to marvel at how they manage to make something ugly seem almost beautiful. It's a bit of a twisted concept really. A bit like Gen then, given his transformation from man to woman lately but then that's the whole deal with Throbbing Gristle - twisted concepts are par for the course!

Blade 2 is symptomatic of most sequels in that it is not as enjoyable as the first movie. The acting in the movie is still great and cannot be touched upon but all too often the film relies too much on flashbacks and the pace is a bit too slow for my liking. I know that sometimes a film needs to start slow sometimes and I could accept this in Blade 2 but it seems to take an age in getting out of the slow start and by the time it really begins to get in gear - it's too late and the film is almost over. Also the soundtrack isn't as powerful as the first one. It seems to be set for the goth market and it just doesn't have that same "je ne sais quoi" of the first oneI would like to reiterate that I didn't find the movie [garbage] in anyway. It is a good movie and is one of the better movies to come out of Hollywood in 2002 but it's just that there was not enough action in it and it felt a little stale. I just hope they don't make a Blade 3 because that would completely ruin the integrity that the first one had.

This ain't pretty and shouldn't even be bought by anybody. If you hear Bob Mould's singing through all the guitar noise you wouldn't be surprised - it doesn't sound good and sounds so laboured and forced. The guitars are good for 1 track but when there's little variation in them there's not a lot else you can admire in them. I tried New Day Rising as well and Mould's voice still sounds so forced. Avoid although if you are determined to buy something of this nature I'd suggest Sonic Youth's Confusion is Sex/Kill Yr Idols - it has a bit more bite to it

can keep up with it that is.It's a good album if you are in the mood but this album ranges from schizo to full blown dementia of any kind. The way the tracks just jump in and out together make it one of the more taxing Zappa album there is. Although hats off for the track Prelude to The Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask for having the weirdest and most hilarious title ever. Admittedly showing this to your friends will have them think you're off your rocker but nevermind that.To put this album in a nutshell it is quite simply mad - there's no other like it - but then it is so definitely of Zappa's nature that hey you have to try it.Interestingly enough if you are buying this purely because of the title of the album.....be prepared for a little shock

I think ever since Depeche Mode brought out Violator DM have been more than a little bit patchy. Songs Of Faith And Devotion was an album which was fairly poor because some of the songs were just a tad bit too pompous and it revealed a few too many weaknesses. Ultra was a fine album and although near the end it kinda loses it's momentum it was a fine testimony that Depeche Mode could still be up there with the best of them however Exciter was at best your sleeping partner for those insomniac nights.This video charts DM's first major tour since the Devotional Tour and it's fair to say that it's not a great concert they picked. You get the feeling with this video that what you are watching is synth pop's Rolling Stones belting out those classics one more time. In fact you kinda cringe when Dave Gahan quips &quot; Marty's still got the moves &quot;. The songs themselves cannot be touched upon. They're good but in some cases Dave's voice sounds like it's going to give way. Anton's effects though are truly mesmerising, there's no denying that. It is the highlight of this video which is unfortunate as when you buy a video like this what you want is a little more than stunning visuals that hypnotize you. In fact the visuals seem more of a distraction than anything else.In short it's not the best Depeche Mode video there is but then again if you want everything that they made then you might as well get it. Stick to the videos where they show you their rather filmy &quot; promotional videos &quot; as they tend to be a lot more interesting. If you still want a live concert video of DM then go with 101 or Devotional. Perhaps they are better than this one

Having made the nostalgic eXistenZ, Cronenberg tackles another "unfilmable" book with considerable ease. It deals with a schizophrenic, played by Ralph Fiennes. We are given a tour of how Spider ( Fiennes ) ended up in a halfway house. His parents' relationship on icy waters, a prostitute who becomes the father's mistress and the confusion that lies beyondFiennes does a tremendous job acting as Spider here. Admittedly he doesn't say much, just mumbles something incoherently but it's amazing how much fear he has when he smells gas in his room and gets newspapers to cover him from the stench of gas.Those thinking that Cronenberg has made another gory "Baron Von Blood" epic should either be pleasantly surprised or disgusted that he hasn't done that this time. In fact the only bit of sickening feature is where Miranda Richardson ( who plays Spider's mother and the father's mistress ) flits away a bit of the father's ( Gabriel Byrne ) semen into a nearby lake. In fact the first script which was written by Patrick McGrath was dismissed by Cronenberg as he felt he wanted something a little more realistic ( a potato filled with blood anyone? ) but nonetheless frightening.This film is a remarkable achievement and is beautifully shot. The acting is superb and you can just picture London ( where it is shot ) in its 1950s state. Overall Cronenberg fans should be pleased and for Ralph Fiennes fans.....well I hope they can appreciate the good work he can play as a schizophrenic as he certainly plays the part well

The space age music here on Phaedra is something else. The music pulses through and at times the music feels very haunting to listen to.....which disproves electro music critics that electronic music lacks the feeling of a real guitar ( total rubbish that )Listen to this music and be amazed - this CD takes you places!

Had it not being for Ian Curtis' suicide who knows what would have happened . Would Joy Division still be with us today , would we have ever known of a type of music called " goth " music . There's so many questions we'll never find out and perhaps never will but that doesn't mean you can never try and find out for yourself .Closer is as what many people say Ian's suicide note to the world . It's sad and haunting as is any suicide note . But it's amazing how wonderfully orchestrated the music is to suit Ian's every word . Even if you don't know what the hell Ian is singing at least the music in the background will give you idea . Now that might not sound like everybody's cup of tea but if you want a good idea of the utter desperation and hatred and helplessness Ian felt then this is the album for you .At least give it a try - I assure you , you'll love it

Well if you're not too familiar with the thick gangsta London accent you'll have no idea if you're " swuttin lak a fackin cant." Usually I don't watch gangster movies but this movie was slightly different. Ben Kingsley really did sound like a psychotic schizophrenic in the movie that it felt more real. The fact that he was talking to himself in the mirror rambling " yew facked it der yew prolly shuddentive sed yew facked hur." You probably won't cheer as much as you see his demise. But I'll leave you to watch the rest. Awesse yew ga-ing daan

With the songs all short they don't really have room to roam around - there needs to be some sort of space within them. As it stands it sounds a bit too cramped and compressed. There would be much better stuff to come from Mogwai. This shows they had potential.....they just needed a little bit of space

I got this album from my girlfriend expecting it to be as good as the single, Lo-Fiction. And at first I thought the album was incredibly awkward in that it didn't know which way to turn whether to be retro-futurist or just something different altogether. But with further listening you begin to hear the subtlety that this album requires. Of course Lo-Fiction is good but you begin to find gems in the John Foxx duet on Dislocation and the lovely sounding StyrkkaritLaukkeeTaas. Definitely worth investing in if you like your electronic music just a touch cool

This is a very unnerving soundtrack to listen to. The wiry guitars make you feel really uncomfortable and some of the effects are almost scary. Howard Shore's collaborations are noted for their eerie nature and this lives up to that as well. Though not as full blown as Scanners ( when will they release the music on that to CD - it's so perfect ) this CD can still creepy crawl into your skin

There's always a problem with difficult albums. A) It's not easily accessible and B) It may play with your nerves. Give them time though and you'll enjoy them all the same. This album is one of them. But for those who feel that listening to the 40 minute Dead Relatives is a little daunted shall rest at ease - it's a great song ( once you don't concentrate on it too much )Other than that the best tracks are Black Honeymoon with Kirk chanting something about " a chemical eye ", Nocturnal Children for it's sheer eerie synth work and Wiretrap makes it another eerie work from Kirk... This is a somewhat strange album because you're not expecting the synthesizers to sound THAT primitive. But given a bit of time the results do stand out for themselves. It also gives us that rare thing of a Cabaret Voltaire novelty track in Do The Snake where Mallinder ( at least I think it's him - his voice sounds so different than on later records ) intoning " Gonna make you slide gonna make you shake " and " Get up...no I mean...Get down " and just a generally fun song in all. The last three tracks Venusian Animals, The Outer Limits and She Loved You are all very paranoid with Mallinder whispering on the last track " She loves you, she knows your number, she says she almost lost her mind." Also The Outer Limits has the odd sound of cash registers opening and closing on the song. Definitely a paranoid listen

With 9/11, America has had to question themselves and with that there has been the war on Afghanistan and Iraq. There have been some that have supported George W Bush's " war on terrsm " and there have been some who have spoken out about this only to have the humiliation to retract the comments and say " I love my country and all it's given me " ( Sorry to sound like an outsider but that seems like such a spineless thing to say ). But now it's in fashion to be anti-Bush, and the Beasties are no different. This album is probably more overtly political than their others but it's not all " We hate Dubya " parade. Sure, it has a few sideswipes but musically it's going back to the old-skool style and it works. Don't get me wrong when I first heard they were going to make an anti-war/anti-Bush album I thought it was going to be a bit of a mistake but fortunately there's some of the usual shenanigans that you would associate with Beasties albums. But obviously, the real centrepiece is An Open Letter to NYC. The lyrics may seem a little naff but it's heartfelt and that's what counts and it seems like such a positive message for the people of New York which is nice and makes a change from some of the doom and gloom merchants that you'll hear from day to day.In short, some may be put off by the politics on this album. Some may even think, " I wait six years for this!?!?!." But if anything the album is more tightly compact and less bloated than Hello Nasty. Either way, despite some changes, it's still the same old Beasties, wisecracking but not forgetting the serious side too

The Human League are not a band that I would usually associate with good music . But this album is an exception . There are some strong songs on here and you have to admire the craft that went into these . Almost Medieval , Empire State Human , Introducing , Being Boiled and The Dignity Of Labour Parts 1-4 are all amazing and trance inducing and , to a certain extent , paranoid .I'd like to thank a reviewer here for mentioning the fact that this is &quot; Human League for those who hate the Human League &quot; for if he had not have mentioned that I probably wouldn't have gone and bought the album .At least try it if you like experimental electro music - you may be surprised

Poor Kylie. This was meant as a more mature Kylie. Co-writing songs and taking a more indie approach to fit in with the times. That's not the Kylie we want say the public. We want fun loveable Kyles. We want the songs all light and fluffy. We want songs that remind us of time when we were little kids glued to our TV sets watching Neighbours to see her as Charlene. We don't want an album full of dark songs.......Unfortunately, this has been cruelly overlooked and underrated by many critics. Some of her hardcore fans however have given this album a reappraisal and so it should be. It is a great cohesive album much more than the sum of a few songs thrown together to help out the singles. True it's easy to see why this album was a flop and how it lost Kylie a record contract for a few years.....but it was simply trying to fit in with the times and in some cases it was as inventive as anything could be within the pop format. But it didn't sell so it was back to drawing board and back to square one. The sort of stuff that made her in the first place - disposable disco music!But that's Kylie, every once in a while she seems to get bored with producing the same thing over and over again and wants a change. There's nothing wrong with that. I think it's good that she at least has a go at trying to reinvent herself like Madonna. However there is the problem sometimes that not everyone wants to see that change and, as can happen, it can be seen as losing the plot. A shame because this album is much more than that.

Ah Bjork. You either love her music and think she's one of the most creative forces or " she's that annoying little pixie with that funny accent." These "Greatest Hits" collection is actually very nice ( yes I was one of those people who a while back wouldn't touch any of her albums if you paid me ). Thankfully the set doesn't include It's Oh So Quiet which has to be the most annoying song she's made at all. Funnily enough it was her big/greatest hit so for some this set may be somewhat flawed. But the album can go on without it. All Is Full of Love is a great song although in some ways it still feels that it was eclipsed by the video that was made by Chris Cunningham. Army of Me sounds great. Harsh pummeling synths, a sinister feel overall made with an incessant chorus....it is thoroughly addictive. My real favourite of the set rivalled by Play Dead which is just awesome. Looking back on the set retrospectively, I suppose some of the singles were really wonderful but I didn't appreciate them fully but also the songs seem to lose a bit of life compared to the videos that were made for them. Perhaps Bjork is a more visual performer ( would that be a reason to why she has so many DVDs ) but she's still got some great songs that should be appreciated by all who give her a chance. Notice how I didn't stop at "all."

It takes a bit of getting used to but once you like it , you'll love it . Dancefloor frenzies on here are I Travel , Today I Died Again , Celebrate and Thirty Frames a Second . I would agree with the review in owning a few more albums before buying this . But I feel that if you bought Celebration first then you'll get a better understanding of the album as there are a few songs on that album that are also here namely I Travel Celebrate Thirty Frames a Second and Kant Kino ( the last one is uncredited on the album for some strange reason )Buy this and you will love it .

Yes this is poorly recorded if you are used to their more recent releases. Don't forget this was recorded on a 8-track so it's no surprise that some of the tracks end a bit suddenly or in case of Freezer/I Wanna Be Your God just one being mutated into another. Whether this was intentional now or not I have no idea but it only makes it seem more uneasy when that menacing feedback mutates into insane guitars and Kim Gordon screaming to all and anyone that will listen to her. I think the notes say it all - she really does sound unstable!There are other highlights including Inhuman which I have to admit, I have no idea how those sounds came out of a guitar. It just sounds so surreal and frightening. Also Confusion is Next is worth a mention although it is utterly deranged as the lyrics want to wrench our tongues out from &quot; it's ugly f**king cancer root &quot;I did say frightening didn't I? Well if I haven't I just have now and there really is no other word for this album. But worth it if you are serious in delving into the realms of Sonic Youth

I don't know why this album does be overlooked by Sonic Youth fans as it is a joy to listen to. Yes there's an acoustic track in there but just one and that's the first track ( and it ain't half bad either!). I'll admit they might not seem as out there but this was a logical step-forward from Dirty and it improved on some of Dirty's flaws ( which you can easily see ).And yes you could see that there's more of pop influence in what they were doing but it's done elegantly and there's nothing superficial in it's execution. Also you got to check out for the hidden track at the end. It's surely one of the most bizarre things you'll ever hear!Perhaps not for everyone but at least give it a try!

If you want to get into some Sonic Youth but are afraid to test their albums ( and I can fully empathize having being one of them myself ) this compilation will serve as a godsend to you. However I must warn you that you might feel a little tricked ( not in a bad way though ) with this compilation for on the most part this album is really mellow only with the later tracks piling on the noisier tracks but it does serve as a useful starter for anybody interested as it whets the appetite for more Sonic Youth records.Buy this album and you might become a SY junkie.....join the club we all know how you feel

This was the album that made me buy more Cabaret Voltaire records. I must say that this was and still is great. From the opening swings of Just Fascination to the stuttering brilliance of Sensoria ( d-d-d-do right ), this album has it all. Admittedly it may not leave you as paranoid as the 78-82 collection but it has enough to satisfy you. It's also probably the best way to start your collection of CV because the early stuff is probably a bit too much to start off with

But I had to have this album. I remember when I was 10 I heard The Heart's Filthy Lesson and I thought it was an intriguing song that I thought was pretty good. The other song I heard was the Pet Shop Boys remix of Hallo Spaceboy which was also great. I never thought of getting in it until the last 2 years. I couldn't find it anywhere and I found out that it had been deleted ( a bit of a rarity given that this is David Bowie we're talking about )!I went to Holland last year and looked all over for it and almost ended up in failure. But I managed to get it by asking a guy at the shop ( well it was a CD library where people take a loan of CDs ) and he agreed to sell it for 18! Fair deal I thought. I know it may seem expensive but given the way prices go on ebay I'd stick with that.At first it seemed overlong, overdrawn but had some great songs. With repeated listens though it gets better and you'll get everything from industrial rock to a bit of techno and a sample of crowds cheering and more besides.As for the whole theme of the concept - you can disregard it in some respects. It's too confusing to comprehend and apparently the theme you've been told was just a bit of a cover up to how a society has led us into repressed lives and how we live in schizophrenic times. If that's just gone over your heads don't worry - it had that same effect on me. But then I have this feeling he may be having a little snipe at the media by covering up his real intentions about what the concept album was about.Well anyway whatever your feelings are on about the whole concept of the album - everything seems to have a valid reasoning. The main thing about this album is the music and what I can say is that it is very good.Oh and by the way those segues are hilarious &quot; It was like a fading photograph &quot;

OK I'll admit that I'm not a U2 fan and never really was but as I used to work in a record shop we used to have to listen to this a fair bit. I found it to be very disappointing. There were lyrics at times at which Bono thought to himself &quot; I write the greatest lyrics when I'm asleep in bed.&quot; Which they're not. Another thing that is so predictable about U2 and their albums is how earnest they are about it. It's so excessive that it becomes drenched in it and it can be a bit hard to take. The whole sound really sounds the same as if they just couldn't be really all that bothered about their albums anymore. And well that's it. When I heard it I thought &quot; They should call it a day &quot; because the band really sound tired. They put no effort in it at all. But yet RollingStone loves them and they continue to sell records. So personal opinion will always be inferior to the vast amount of records they continue to sell.Incidentally, Bono ( the great man for warbling a whole load of nothing ) said that their new album is &quot; getting closer to the album we always wanted to make.&quot; For all U2 fans out there I hope he doesn't mean it's going to be another bland outing because this album is fluff compared to their others.

movie )OK I'm sure many people bought this expecting it to be a horror movie because it was made in the 70s and Christopher Lee starred in the movie. This couldn't be further from the truth. It was intelligently written and while it showed it's fair share of nudity - it was enjoyable and had a sense of pastoral quietness that I hadn't seen in movies before. It was funny hearing these pagans breaking into dirty little songs about sex or something related to it.The one problem with reviewing this film today is that people may presume that the policeman is the guy we should be booing. But I would disagree - I think at the time when this film was released people could relate to the policeman because he was a Christian and I think at the time ( although it's this I'm a little unsure of ) people had a lot more respect for people. To watch something like this was of course a little terrifying for them.It does bring up what happens when some people's minds are closed when it comes to different religions. It's something that still happens today so the film is far from dated. We see today in the news about Israel and Palestine and The divide in the North of Ireland with the Unionists and Nationalists. It's not something you'll actually get from watching the movie but you'll notice it after you watch the newsAs for the movie - enjoy it - have a laugh with the songs and well it's just....just something that seemed out of place in the horror genreNow a 1, and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 - Corn rigs and barley, corn rigs and barrrrlllleeeeeeeeeey

This album is haunting and if we face facts it is a very miserable and depressing music to listen to. But if you are a fan this is essential only if it happens that all your old CDs/records are scratched to death. What you have here is a loving cherished box set which you can tell has been delved into deeply by those involved ( something that reports say haven't been in the New Order boxset )This is the music you'll play when you're in a bad mood because it will give you some comfort but I stress it probably has to be a last resort because it may cause some terrible problems. And whatever you do don't listen to them all at once. You might be nearly dead by the time it's finishedJust a warning

British Sea Power are being lauded as an eccentric English band with songs about the North Pole ( Oh Larsen B ) and playing concerts at the Chelsea Flower Show but they are so crushingly boring it's unreal. Admittedly the album starts off nicely but within 2 or 3 songs you notice that it becomes more of the same stuff again and again. The production on this is horrible as it just gives off a horrible lumpiness to the proceedings. If it were handled with a little more care, perhaps it might have sounded less forced. To their credit though the band have admitted this and that's fine by me.Incidentally, they've been playing a freeform gig with legendary Krautrock gods Faust. Apparently the drummer was doing one of these long drum solos which pissed off the lead singer of Faust so much that the singer went over and started punching him in the face and led to a bit of a brawl. The drummer ended up with a black eye. Ouch

Set around a country block of appartments which sits itself outside the city but with all the requirements of city life - life couldn't be much better. Well almost......We are given this lovey dovey image of a picturesque block of appartments that really give off this relaxed vibe. But a 17 young girl is spreading a virus unbeknownst to it inhabitants. Immediately we see her being strangled to death by a doctor who then proceeds to cut her open and put highly caustic acids to kill whatever it is that is inside of her. So ashamed of this he then slits his throat.....These sequences will set you up for the rest of the film. It seems almost eerie how the philosophy works and how deranged they can be at times. More and more people start complaining of this thing that's in their stomach. This leads one randy old man to remark " it feels kinda sexual " to the nurse ( played by the beautiful Lynn Lowry ).It comes to the stage that there are those who have it outnumber those who haven't and it's more or less just a fight for survivalI won't say more as I feel I might have given too much away but I got this movie a few years back in a second hand shop since at the time anything with Cronenberg was an instantly bought on my part ( I still do the same now but I've got nearly everything ) and when I put this on I felt the same way those trying to survive do. Trapped! I could have turned the video off but I couldn't take my eyes away from it. It was gripping - almost hypnotic to watch. The film shook me so much that I had to watch it again 2 HOURS LATER after it was finished. That has never happened before to me and never since and it was still good when I watched it the second time.I don't know what else to say about this film but just buy it and see what you thinkPS While I'm here I suppose like many other Cronenberg fans would like to see his pre-Shivers experimental movies. Anything he does is worth a look at

Well this is one Sonic Youth's more experimental releases ( if you hadn't gathered by now ) and it's fair to say that this is a challenging listen. You'll need to keep your wits about you and a sense of humour to contain this on first listen. It's quite possibly one of those &quot; gets on your nerves &quot; sort of album at first albums. But give it time and you appreciate the album that it sets out to be. You're not going to absolutely love this but you can enjoy it for what it is or yank it out of your stereo system and criticize Sonic Youth as bulls**t poseurs. It all means the same thing - nothing!

I bought this as one of the starters into Front 242's music - along with Geography and to be honest this release gives me mixed feelings. While the music is superb - that in itself does give me visions of being a racing driver driving for his team at Le Mans.....the DVD is rather flimsy in comparison. Meandering and not half as interesting. And the interviews are boring. Listening to only the driver's voice without any pictures of the guy talking is really terrible and uninspiring. Perhaps they ran out of money on the budget they had in mindAs I said the music is faultless - it's a great industrial/techno hybrid.....it's just the shame the DVD couldn't be that bit better

For those expecting a brutal all-out assault keyboard riffs will be pleased in this album . Astroblaster, Joyrex, The Garden of Linmiri ( which actually samples a snippet of a track from his Analogue Bubblebath 3 album ) and much more besides. If you want songs that will give your ears and feet a rest, do not worry- Richard has that sorted out as well, there are few of them to keep you from going completely over the top. Overall, I say buy and enjoy

There's just so much good stuff on this record that it cannot be believed. This is the most cohesive record Wire made and possibly the most challenging. The songs are too good to be true but very dark taking on tales of schizophrenia, break-up in relationships and something about reading the &quot; Nouvelle Observateure &quot;This album may take a while to get used to but if and when it does.....the highlights are endlessPS Doesn't Once Is Enough sound like a prototype of The Cure's Lovecats? Or are my ears deceiving me?

Coxon's departure was sad but we move on ( as we have to in some circumstances ) and we get this album - and what a brilliant album it is. Sure Crazy Beat is not really all that great in my opinion but the rest is in my opinion great. And you have to hear Me White Noise as it's the best thing I've heard in ages. If you want to hear it is press on track 1 and start rewinding and you should get it pretty well.While it's sad that Coxon has left the band......what we have left is a band still creative and still hitting the right notes

This is an album you should enjoy and enjoy a lot. Incidentally when a BBC sessions album is released by a band it doesn't really mean it's a live album. It's just the band recording the songs at BBC's studios so that it can be broadcasted on radio at a particular time. So for those who were wondering why there were Liz's voice in the background as well as at the forefront should rest at ease - there was a little bit of studio trickery there. I just I should point that out lest someone gets confused

I finished this within 3 or 4 days and I've never read a more gripping book in all my life. The &quot; 840 chapters &quot; ( I rather call them moments or minutes really ) are brilliantly laid out since it leaves you wanting to know more. At times you have to put the book down since you can't help but be in hysterics of laughter especially with the simulated suicide from &quot; Unfunny John.&quot; All I can say is that you really have to read this book but only if you like your comedy black.

This is a film that will test the bravest souls. I had reviewed this film earlier but Amazon doesn't seem to have shown it perhaps due to it perhaps being seen as an overly hostile review and maybe some coded politics as well. The truth is, with the story the way it pans out ( which I'm not going into detail since plenty here have explained it better ) is that this is indeed, a highly political film. While you may question why it has to show excessive amounts of gore, it is a fair representation of the world we live in. There are morals to this film, but only if you want to learn them. If you just want gore galore then it will also satisfy. It's a film that questions Western society's morality and really pushes to the limits of what people would find decent or indecent. Mankind we learn as we've known before are savages, no matter what environment they are in. It should also teach that you should not mess with people, or things in which you do not know. And of course greed.....but you'll learn that from watching the movie.It's not surprising that this film is still banned in some countries around the world. I've never been a fan of censoring films but perhaps there are some things that need some censoring...but that will only make people more curious. Howandever what you will see in this film is a horror movie that puts others to shame. It's politically charged and shows how cruel mankind can be to the Earth they inhabit with all it's creatures.....it's enough to make you sick to your stomach!

That's all there is to this record. 73 minutes of pure noise twisted into different forms throughout. This is not easy going nor is it melodic. It is possibly the best to put on when you are jaded after another long, hard day of work - this is, surprisingly, the best sort of CD for those type of days. Although I wouldn't exactly call this music - it's the perfect tonic for open minded people to enjoy.

This was the first album from Alan's split with Depeche Mode and it's a pretty good album, despite the odd blunder here and there with the vocals which can be slightly irritating at times, the music here is quite something. Much darker than anything that he had done with Depeche Mode, the resulting sound is something like electro jazz for the late dark nights mixed with trip-hop. Indeed film buffs will find that Apocalypse Now has had a few lines stolen in the first track. It may take a few listens to get into since you may find the spoken-word vocals a little too irritating on first listen but if you can get by that and the whole layered nature of the album - the whole album is thick with samples and sounds - it's an album that needs time whether you'll grant it that or not is up to you. Definitely a more interesting listen to though than any of the other Depeche Mode side-projects which just seem like out-takes ( alright Fletch may be onto something with Client but he sensibly doesn't play anything! )

I must admit I rarely ever listen to metal because the bands I usually hear are crass or in the case of some death metal bands I've heard....they sound as sedate and sludgy and not really all that interesting. This however is not sedate.....this is fierce and manic beyond all belief. This is what metal is supposed to be like. The leads solos sound so caustic that they compliment the lyrics so well and can at times seem unbearable ( well that's if you link the lyrics and the riffs together - otherwise they're riff haven for the metal afficionado )Coming from someone who usually never really buys a metal album....this is essential....it's only a pity that they spawned off an entire generation of sub-standard crap imitators

Practically if you were Republican, you did not watch this simple as that. I however had different reasons for not watching this mainly because being an Irishman I thought that since I do not vote in the American elections it's not really going to help me that much. I wouldn't say that this was a flaw......it's just that it felt like a propaganda machine about George W Bush's time in power and how he used September 11th 2001 to his advantage and if you really did watch this you'd really have to vote John Kerry............so here we are, Bush is still in power ( so much for the propaganda working ) and so I finally watch the documentary. And it is shocking. You see the horrors of the brutality of war and there is no sugary-sweet rendition and you see that American media is not allowed to show the mass amount of American coffins and the changes in the opinion of one Lila Lipscomb. Beforehand she's just a regular " conservative Democrat " who is proud that her son and others are fighting to free the Iraqi people. But from what? The people there seem not to mind Saddam. Even though I'm skeptical that all Iraqis love Saddam I do have to wonder where George Bush got these Iraqis thanking him that he freed the Iraqi people.....it's a very strange set of affairs when you find that most of the children in Iraq are at a funfair while GWB declares war on Iraq. It pretty much is certain that this was an agenda motivated by the fact that we " don't forget this guy almost shot my daddy dead." Which shows that Iraq was an entirely personal agenda which doesn't even begin to explain how dangerous this president is.What I find more disturbing is the one elderly Iraqi woman feeling completely enraged by what is happening to her fellow countrymen. She's almost manic with rage and tears for her dead countrymen and women. It's frightening and I can fully sympathize with her. When Lila discovers that her son had died in the line of duty and feels similar feelings of dismay and betrayal....although it is moving you don't honestly get the same sense of violent rage and, as bad as this probably sounds, you don't feel as sorry for her ( which I sincerely do feel sorry for her don't get me wrong ) as the Iraqi woman. Besides after seeing how the American army treated it's prisoners it's really hard for you to portray them as the good guys.While there are a few inaccuracies somewhere in the film ( you probably might see them along the way, you might not ), and you may still get the overriding sense that this is a propaganda machine ( if you live outside the US ), there is a sense that the film means well and tries to show a different view that is not shown by the American media. Even still, this film really is just preaching to the converted so if you think Bush has done a good job and are unflinching in your support, you know what you think. However it would be nice if everyone saw this movie in America but......you can't depend on people's beliefs just to change just like that. Anyway look on the bright side people, it's his last term so he can't do anything more after that although the downside is he's still probably scheming his next plan up and god help the world whatever it is

Watching Ed Wood movies and watching Ed Wood there is an alarming thing - Ed Wood's life was better suited to a movie than he was as a director! And as he tried woefully to express this side of his personality to the public with the woeful Glen or Glenda ( " Did you see the movie? Uh huh. Worst movie you saw in your life? OK but how about.....hello hello! )Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ed and really plays the part extraordinarily well. You almost feel sorry for him as he gets rejected from everyone because he seems to have his intentions right no matter how skewed they end up being.Of course Ed has a fetish for women's clothing which would make itself known in the film Glen or Glenda but Dolores wouldn't know about this until she read the script. Let's just say she doesn't take to it as well as Ed's rather naive script would like her to be! Although I have to admit that Sarah Jessica Parker is not exactly that easy to like in the movieMartin Landau is the one who I think plays Bela Lugosi and I have to say that the resemblance is uncanny that you almost feel like singing the line from the Bauhaus song Bela Lugosi's Dead -" Oh Bela, Bela's not dead " indeed!Bill Murray is fantastic in his role. As ever, he has the best lines in this movie. One of the best roles I've seen him inI've seen this film - it must be about nearly 7 or 8 times and it's so funny that some of the lines in it are implanted in my head. One that has to be watched for those interested in seeing something a little unusual

An absolute masterclass of an album. Pure controlled aggression put down into a spellbinding 31 minutes. I know that could sound like too many superlatives but I bloody well mean every word I say with this album. There is not one bad track on this and although it is a very short album it is a bittersweet experience. Bitter in its content but sweet listening. The day I first got this I listened to this I was jumping around and put it on repeat. The sheer reckless/feckless energy this has is something else. Pure brilliance what more can I say. I would say that this should be essential listening to everybody but that would be mere bias on my part as would be me saying that every track on here should be a single but I'll try not to get too carried away here. Recommended? You bet. And tell your friends about this band. And they should tell their friends too.Right I should stop now before I sound like a PR for the band.

Okay this is not really breaking new ground and it indeed has shades of SYR 3 but then that's not the point. What we have here is an elegant and beautiful sounding recording which almost shimmers with beauty. Certainly it is a "mood" piece and it does create that almost effortlessly. Well worth investigating.

Ian Curtis has been dead for over 20 years but he has left an enigma that still lingers on . If you want answers in this book inevitably you are not going to find them . Deborah had known Ian since their childhood but even she doesn't know why he killed himself . And that mainly is the story . It's how she grew up with him became his wife and the troubles she had to deal with from having a child , Natalie , and Ian having epileptic fits . But yet when it comes to Ian's suicide it is quite chilling all the same . It provides lyrics both known and unknown to us and various unfinished pieces that he was working on . You may scratch the surface but you will never get the true meaning of Ian Curtis no matter how many sides of the story you get .

Yeah I know that most of these songs are on albums and everywhere else but many of the songs ( particularly Silence Is Sexy ) allow to track to breathe a bit more. I still don't like it but it sounds a whole lot better than the studio version. Excellent sound quality and bizarre mutterings from Blixa when the song hasn't started at times. They even lost a couple of verses from Newtons Gravititlichkeit ( but I'm sure they have a copy of their album somewhere and will find the lyrics ). Otherwise all I have to say is that the crowd seem to enjoying the show. Perhaps a little too much when you consider that Jubel is 2 and a half minutes of live cheering after Redukt which leaves you wondering &quot; Was that really necessary? Couldn't they just cut that out? &quot; Nevertheless an excellent live show. Also if you've been doubtful over which albums you should get of Neubauten - this will come as a handy accessory

I bought this when I was having a search around in Tower Records. They were playing this and I was hooked by how catchy it was. Songs played on Atari computers - fantastic! Admittedly you have to be in a fun mood to listen to these. None of it is to be taken seriously - as if you can take the lyrics &quot; Ich singe keine melodien Ich singe eins zwei drei vier, &quot; serious literally translated &quot; I sing no melody I sing 1, 2, 3, 4 &quot;Have fun and remember it's nothing serious

Any Fall record is worth it's weight in dirt-ridden gold and this is no exception. True it seems somewhat uneven when you pair two parts of Shoulder Pads and Mr Pharmacist with Living Too Late but the songs still shine despite the murkiness of it all. Though it has to be said that US 80s 90s is fantastic electro drum rock track and deserves to be twice as long as it is on this record. Worth the money

Pan Sonic return with this follow up to the mammoth Kesto. It's not an easy to listen to album. At times the album sounds way too disjointed with sounds just popping up here and there without any real connection. At times it almost sounds like Kesto but it doesn't. Dig into a little more and there's a real difference. The effect of Hildur Gudnadottir's cello is deceptive. At first you don't think it goes with Pan Sonic's noise aesthetic but listen to it more and they compliment each other well. Some have said that it gives a human feel to proceedings, I would disagree......if anything, the tracks which Hildur's cello appear on ( tracks 1, 8 and 14 ) make it sound a more alien experience. Which can only be what Pan Sonic would have wanted.I won't say that it is their best album, for me their earlier albums still hold much more for me and Kesto provided something regardless of your mood, but it is a very strong album. Deceptively so. It may not prove much on first listen, second listen, third listen but gradually it works it's way on you and you begin to see it for what it is.

These remixes do a damn good job of the material there is given. From noise workouts ( a la Kevin Shields and My Bloody Valentine ) to funky workouts ( DJ Q's remix of R U Still Into It ). This remix album has something for everybody. Although depending on how you view remix albums, you'll still be missing out on one of the most addictive albums there are - remix album or not!

I had read about the controversy surrounding this film and was really interested in seeing how this film would turn out. I had read that perhaps the story behind this film was made up despite protestations that they had accurate resources. Obviously other reviewers here have reviewed the movie in greater detail but I have to say I enjoyed it immensely. I was surprised by the audacity that Spielberg went to make this film. Yes I know he made Schindler's List but for me he's always been more interested in crowd-pleasers. This however seemed like a labour of love. The scenery is shot so beautifully, that it's quite breathtaking. You get into the minds of these people, their fear, their doubts, their paranoias. Most of all their beliefs too. And when they have to commit something their conscience would usually tell them not to do, that is what is interesting. It was interesting to see how people's beliefs drive them to do something they wouldn't normally do - how they feel for their families they have to leave behind and may never see again. How even sleeping on a bed is a killer. The fact that these memories remain in their minds is something they have to live with. The feeling that they could be constantly in jeopardy. How politics can sometimes can get in the way of religion or even play a part in politics. It's an endless game that no one wins and the only loss can be somebody's life. It's to Spielberg's credit that he made a film like this that questions people's beliefs and whether the interpretations people get out of them are really true. A masterpiece of film making. Well worth investigating even if you might not agree with what the film's message intends to be. However these are just my thoughts, yours can be totally different to what I have just put down. Savour this one.

When I first bought this I really couldn't get into it. It just seemed so incoherent and messy but then gave it a few more listens and then a few more and finally seemed to gel together. The only gripes I have now is that 911 Is A Joke was covered by Duran Duran ( no one really wants to hear that ). But the thicker the beats, the rhymes and all make this all the more a delicious album to get into. And besides who can resist Fight The Power. (...)

Stockhausen is without doubt the pioneer of electronic music. I would venture to say that he would be more influential than The Beatles who are often tagged as influencing everyone. But having listened to this work, you can't help but feel, on first listen, that this is an extremely random, alienating listening experience. Is it good? On first listen you may not think so. But with repeated listens it gradually makes a little more sense. But it still feels impossibly random and you don't know where the next sound is going to come from. In a way this is more like a horror movie played through music in that you truly don't know what's going to happen next. And the fact that with repeated listens you still have no clue either makes this a work of eccentric genius that should be hailed or as has being quoted one time whether someone heard of Stockhausen's music " I don't think I've heard any but I believe I have trodden on some." So your ears are needed here to make out what you think is right option.

17 years and this is what you get - a techno album that initially disappoints with a four part structure that just kinda drags but after that it gets better. But that's on first listen. The more you listen the more you get to grips with this smoother Kraftwerk album - I say smoother because the keyboards are a lot less slow respond than on the classic albums. It's a low key cut from the guys that probably serves them well......but it's not totally low key as anyone would tell you.....a new Kraftwerk album is still something to shout about.Vitamin and Elektrik Kardiogramm are the ones that get a mention as the best tracks on the album. Also it is rather fitting to have the original ( if slightly retooled ) Tour de France to close out the album.Admittedly it's not the greatest Kraftwerk album there is but then.....some people's expectations may be a bit too high. Just enjoy it for what it is as I'm sure there aren't going to be many Kraftwerk albums being released in the future if at all so better just accept it.For the pretensious among you - you might point out the fact that the start of the album seems to be a bit rusty as if the chain needed a good oiling but then afterwards the gears started to get in motion and everything gets better after that.....and I suppose that may be a fair pointAnyway as I was saying - enjoy the album for what it is....and don't expect anything Aphex or Autechre like....I don't think that would work for Ralf und Florian

I rarely listen to this although having said that I have been listening to it a lot more recently. The fact is is that this is a hard thing to recommend. You might not have some of the songs that are on here and for that you might want to top up. I bought it as an overview of Bowie's earlyish career ( I'm not going anywhere near The Laughing Gnome ). Which in hindsight was probably a bit of a mistake but I wouldn't buy this album if it didn't have the extra CD - call me banal if you will but that's what happens when you have collector tendancies in you!Bowie's early stuff ( pre-Ziggy ) sounds anodyne and twee. The conversations you hear on the CD make Bowie seem genuinely nervous but pleasantly friendly. Of course he might not do one song &quot; because to do it would be possibly over everyone's budget.&quot; You could take that as nerves if you will but this is the BBC we're talking about. Their budgets at the time were not astronomical.I've said this before that when you see &quot; Live At The BBC &quot; it doesn't really mean it's really *live* if you've ever heard BBC radio presenters like John &quot; that was quite tasty &quot; Peel or any others you'll know that they say &quot; and we have [musician's name] here live in the studio.&quot; It's in a studio and it will never give you a live feel for the songs. It's just BBC engineers working on Bowie's songs and in return you could I suppose think of them as session outtakes from his album. But one thing should be made clear - if you haven't got Bowie's version of Jacques Brel's Amsterdam, this is where you can get it. It's passion almost matches Le Grand Jacques in it's intensityAs the second CD moves and the classics come in you begin to think &quot; this is more like it &quot; and Bowie seems more at ease with everything. Notice his covers of White Light/White Heat ( &quot; make me sound like Lou Reed &quot;)Now the third CD becomes even more sprawling since it tries to fill in all the places that the first two CDs left out. And it's not always a winner. Little Wonder and I'm Afraid of Americans are terrible songs but actually sound better than what they sounded like on their original album. Still doesn't make it good but at least you can probably tolerate it this time. But overall it didn't capture the gig very well since I saw this on TV when I was 15 and I thought the gig was fantastic. Bowie really had them going ( but then that was to be expected right? ), the CD just doesn't capture the songs well and though I like nearly all of the songs, it lacks the cohesion that the show actually had. Still, for the money I paid for this it's not too bad. But then, there's always a nagging feeling that it could be improved but whatever about that, the sheer amount of material you have here you can be somewhat happy if you want to buy this.....of course that is if you are a diehard fan. If you're not - try figuring out which compilation you want to get of Bowie. There's a lot of them around!

Just what music should be. Some nice instrumentals. A bit of a sense of humour to the mix and good lyrics ( well most of the time ) and what you have is a compilation of tracks that float in your head with great tunes and melody. Amazing to think that in just such a short space of time the Human League would become synth pop's Abba and this work would go unheard of until now. Shame it went to waste. Oh well not to worry.....this compilation should have you enjoying this to no end.....if you enjoyed Reproduction or Travelogue that isPS The instrumental of Reach Out is fantastic. I never liked the lyrics to the damn thing but this instrumental confirmed what I always thought......great music ruined by the lyrics

This side-project from The Sugarcubes is admittedly just that - a side-project. But it is an interesting one at that. When I bought this, I had half expected this to be horribly like It's All So Quiet. But, thankfully, it wasn't. It's pretty good. Not amazing by any means. The jazz playing is very competent but seems a little bloodless. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it shows she could turn her hand at jazz. And perhaps if it was up to her alone then we could probably see the results being somewhat mut(il)ated.However I have enjoyed this CD as it's quite interesting hearing jazz music with the singing being in Icelandic ( apart from the last 2 ). Track 13 ( to hell if I can remember the name of it properly ) seems strangely like an Icelandic version of the song " When The Rhythm Starts To Play." Which is quite interesting. The last two tracks are sung in English and I feel that they are somewhat tacked on for convenience. It's still competent but it's fun listening to Bjork sing in Icelandic.And that's pretty much it.....it's a fun album. It's nothing to get too involved in seriously. Having said that I notice that Bjork would repeat some of the vocal work here on her guest spots on 808 State's EX:EL. Otherwise there's not too much else to comment about. It's a fun album, it's not meant to be taken seriously and normal service commenced with the D&eacute;but album which was funny given that it was her third album in her name but what can you do!

Normally DVD's by bands tend to be boring, even by those bands you like. This however is pure entertainment. The amount of camera angles, remixes, extras et al is quite astonishing. I used to think you couldn't remix Hey Ladies until I tried the others out and my god they certainly have made me have second thoughts about my original belief. I can hardly begin to tell you of the amount of fun this DVD is. It's one DVD that will get many repeat viewings.....even with the remixes involved. You may feel hard done by with the swearing bleeped out which I admit is a little bit unfortunate but that's only a minor gripe when you consider the amount of fun there is here. An essential purchase for every fan.

Not because Tom's grizzled " one-too-many-bourbons'n'cigs " voice gets irritating ( although it might not help sometimes ) but the actual concept of the album seems a little too real for me. I feel like I'm the character in the music-movie and that I'm the one who seems perpetually lost in a lovelorn lust for a girl. The snow, the ice, how everything seems so weird and foreign - it's like going over traumatic holiday experiences which promised so much and left you empty handed. It seems so brutally honest, so pure, so raw, that it almost hurts you to relive the memories. The only break in the mood is Kommienezuspadt which only seems to heighten the weirdness it is being a foreigner on foreign soil. It's truly remarkable that you can get an album that is so viscerally visual set through music, but that's Tom's way. An amazing accomplishment!

This was their debut album and it is unbelieveable debut album at that . Most of these songs sound like they've been shining down from the Greek gods for a long time . I guarantee you that you get value for money when you listen to the start of A day and up until the very last track it doesn't hold up .Mesmerizing album from an equally mesmerizing band

While I must admit I love the idea that the fans really made this album for parting with their cash to let Neubauten make their album - it seems a little bit of a disappointment this album. While I'm amazed at the instrumentation each and every time with Neubauten - I feel the lyrics are a little silly and perhaps a little bit over-pretentious ( that is if Selbstportrait mit Kater isn't about having a hangover after a night on the towns and just about the galaxy and all that spacy stuff ). It's still easier to digest than Silence is Sexy but it's not an overall complete success. Ozean Und Brandung is however a lovely instrumental - it's just I would like to see more instrumentals but howandever I didn't pay my way so that's my problem!Oh well maybe next time ( if there is one )

Admittedly that is my impressions of what this actually is. By all means bizarre ( but not half as weird as that video ). It's enjoyably fun and something you'll probably have a dirty thought too! The second track is a little bit of a noise-fest ( by the way what's the mathematical equation all about ) and the third track Nannou is a lullaby to make you feel sleepy. Having said that the last two tracks just seem like throwaways from the Come To Daddy EP but I suppose we can level at that. And this was retirement part 1 wasn't it.....didn't end up like that as far as we know

Well if this is the career suicide some reviewers are claiming here then why the hell can't most bands do an album like this. This is first class abrasive stuff. The fact that this was done in 6 weeks makes it all the better if you ask me. There's complete urgency in them that was missing in the too-slick Discovery. Sure Discovery had its moments and very good ones at that too but some of them got a little too 70's disco pop for my liking. While it may never take the place of Homework as a classic it is still worth a shot. It's just a pity people have a certain expectation added by the fact that music magazines hold sway over a lot of people. The best tracks on here in my opinion are Robot Rock, The Brainwasher and Steam Machine which I find is not to everyone's taste. Keep an open mind on this one, you never know what might happen if you give something a bit of time.

Intense, provocative and well acted, this film centres on talk show host who sparks a love-hate relationship with his callers who keep ringing him in despite all of the constant abuse he gives them. Naturally he starts getting death threats because he's a Jew and is about to become a big time radio personality all over America. The ending as is said here is a tad bit predictable but that doesn't make it any less shocking. A good film and I was surprised it was directed by Oliver Stone considering the pile of a mess he made of Natural Born Killers. Good and well worth your money

Knowing Paul Verhoeven's films are a little pervy but this is just plain brilliance. Sex, gore and whole lot more is what you get from this film. Now that doesn't sound like much but given Verhoeven's trademark cynical humour....it all adds up to be one great movie

I got fortune of seeing this on German TV twice within a month which was fantastic. This is compulsive watching as an on-the-road documentary of the band as they set up for their 101st gig at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.Some may complain that there should have been a live video instead of what was given but I disagree. Live videos are somewhat boring as they don't really give you the feeling that is to be there live. Having said that I suppose it would have been a good memento for anyone that was there at the show. But this is just my opinionHowever I do find my annoyances with it myself and that's mainly because of the sidetrack tale of a bunch of teenagers going to the gig and their teenage philosophies. It tends to be very dull and uninteresting and I don't really want to hear their views on fashion ( oh but Depeche Mode means fast fashion doesn't it ). Nevertheless you get a good quote out of one them who hates Guns'n'Roses who retitles them &quot; Guns'n'Posers.&quot; I'm sure Axl wouldn't want to hear it but then given how he likes Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys - I'm sure he takes it as a compliment! Otherwise he would have had the lawyers round!But we know that Dave is &quot; not a f*cking wordsworth &quot; and that Marty began a little obsession with country and western music which goes a long way into explaining why Johnny Cash must have covered Personal Jesus ( although hindsight is a beautiful thing ), Fletch is just there basically to hold them together and Alan reveals that even he cocks up on the keyboards so there's hope for us all. Nevertheless the tape rolls and the concert must go on and as is the way, the band played on

This book is an uncomfortable read at best. The book is monotonous but that's because the main character ( Ballard ) feels that his life is boring and that when he has this car crash one night, it reawakens him from what he sees as a dead end life that he has been living. He almost sees this car crash in such a romantic light that it is what makes this book an uncomfortable read. Cronenberg stayed true to the books contents ( well almost ) and it is to his credit that he had the guts to make this into a film.For those interested in reading this book, they should probably watch the movie first. Or if they have already then I don't think any review is going to stop them - unless they were truly revolted by the movie.I'd say this book is either for Ballard fans or true diehard sickos ( or are they both the same )

This is a CD that will infuriate Kirk fans as it is yet another CD to add to the collection. With Kirk's quality control it does mean though that it's good but you'll have to part with your cash yet again. Since 2001 though, Kirk has been re-releasing material that was either originally hard to find or get some best of's into the catalogue which is great for the uninitiated and a nightmare for the die-hard fan!Basically this collection picks up all the stuff from 74-89 and the result is probably a bit more scattered than you would think. Actually it's a bit like Conform to Deform where it varies from harsh electro-industrial to the beginnings of house and techno. There are some tracks that sound like raw ingredients that would go on other albums while there are other tracks which are wholly new. What is talked about here is Can's I Want More. I haven't heard the original ( been meaning to get into Can for sometime ) but what we have here is Krautrock goes techno! But the delivery of the lyrics is typical of acid house at the time ( &quot; I want more and more and more/more and more and more and more &quot; ).Still this release is bound to get Kirk hounds going. They won't be disappointed unless they would have preferred if the &quot; anthology &quot; were a little more chronological in it's delivery

Inspired by a trip to Haiti - Kirk had set about doing things slightly differently. He wanted to venture into something more cinematic and less aggressive. And it has to be said he's done a great job here. Fusing techno's more intelligent and imaginative genre with African beats and chants and the effect is something that is something subtly emotional but nothing melodramatic. The second CD carries on from where the first left offHowever having said that, listening to this, you do miss the aggressive style that you would associate with Kirk. But then I suppose everyone likes to have a change now and then.

If you were looking to get into Curve and didn't know where to go - this is the answer you were looking for. 31 tracks and over 2 hours of pure great music. Curve are a tricky band to categorize in any genre ( some might say they come under the term " good music " ). Though the press deem them to be unfashionable and label them near to a joke but they're anything but. Step inside and enjoy what's on offer here

Having not bought many mix CDs, I heard this in Tower and immediately bought it. It's such an interesting blend between techno, house industrial and old skool electro. It blends so well that it is almost the perfect mix album. I say almost because the mixing of tracks is not as fluid as can be heard on say Laurent Garnier's superb Excess Luggage. A few of the tracks just seem to introduce themselves unannounced from out of nowhere and while that in itself is no bad thing, particularly when the songs are good, it does tend to be a little jarring. But this should be essential to not just Death in Vegas fans but electro fans as well. But then they could be one and all really.

This is high energy industrial-disco pop. It was here that DAF made their name in German public and media. Banned in some clubs because they were allegedly " politically and sexually ambiguous." A fact that will not be lost on the listener if they know a few words in German. While Die Kleinen Und Die Boesen was a noisy and seemed more associated with the Communist left-wing, Alles Ist Gut is more militant and openly flirts with right-wing fascist imagery, especially visible on Der Mussolini which goes through Mussolini himself, Jesus Christ and Adolf Hitler. Fuel enough for outrage even if the lyrics sometimes border on the ridiculous. But that was the whole point. To ridicule the taboos that were around.The other one that will fuels the sexually ambiguous claims is Der Rauber Und Der Prinz which is again nothing much save for the line " Ich liebe dich meinen Rauber," but having said that since homosexuality is still clearly a taboo subject in some areas today, one can only imagine all too easily what it would've been like 25 years ago. Funnily enough, out of all the tracks that are on the album it clearly sounds the least militant of the lot.My personal favourite of the whole album though is Als Waers Das Letzte Mal which is such an adrenaline packed floor filler that it's bound to get anybody on the dancefloor. It can be open to a few interpretations, not least if you take Der Rauber....into account so you can possibly imagine it as another gay love song but it is seems to be more of an obsessional love song which is highlighted by the real urgency the song has.Overall, you can ignore all the stupid politics and any other things that were raised 25 years ago because at the heart of it all, this is just a stunning album musically. And in the end that's all that matters.

Laurent Garnier has had a glittering career as a DJ and a top one at that too! This album is a little more introspective which sees all his influences melt together and bring this perfect collection electro listening. May not be for the dancefloors but that doesn't stop you from enjoying such delights as the sax led The Man With The Red Face which I always loved but never knew who it was until I got the CD ( pirate radio stations I tell you ). However this CD is a must for anybody with a preference for ice cool synths with a French twist to them

This is one of the albums that seems to be unappreciated by the majority of Ministry fans although I have to admit I am one of those who thinks this album could have been better. Yes I do enjoy the bizarre instruments used ( well for a industrial metal record ) but halfway through it just loses momentum and never really regains it. It is hilarious hearing Al talk in a faux woman's accent from Texas saying &quot; I love all my fans I wish I could take each and everyone of them to the Betty Ford clinic &quot; but that's about it really, the hidden track is alright for a laugh but nothing much else. Still I have to admire them for willing to experiment in a genre that is so steeped in conservatism that it's unreal

While I've never had dinner with these guys, and I think if you judge somebody from having dinner with them then that's completely shallow and to miss the point. Besides, they could have been making a joke with heavy sarcasm. This can happen. I still think this album is great. In places it probably has aged but I think it's done so gracefully. Gems like Make It Mine, Evil Is Even....actually I think it's very strong as an album, a couple of less stellar moments but it's more diverse for a techno album at the time. And hey, this is the American version of the album which is more widely available than the original. Worth a shot if you're not easily put off by dinner conversations. Listen to the samples if you're unsure and then make up your mind

I think the real reason I bought it ( or anyone for that matter ) was to own Need You Tonight. The song was perfect from the get-go. Funky drumbeat, guitars that oozed class and all in all great lyrics to fit a great song. Apart from Guns In The Sky nothing really outclasses it ( nothing can ). Some of the other songs are alright but the last three songs on the album itself just seem to be a case of the band running out of energy with the ideas and it just seemed to go one bit too far. If it had cut those songs out we would have seen a perfect pop-rock album but as it stands it has stood the test of time rather well. Now let's hear it for Need You Tonight one more time

I suppose it was bound to happen really. Those who got The Sounds of Science and The Criterion Video Collection now see this out and apart from the new videos and No Sleep Til Brooklyn and Fight For Your Right and Brass Monkey being on the DVD, there's just no real reason to buy this. Unless you are a rabid collector or, as is the case, a casual Beasties fan. I think this one caters more for the casual fan or newcomers. I don't know though, I still find it hard to recommend this. It just feels like the record company trying to make another buck while the Beasties go on another hibernation period. In another 5 or 6 years time they make another greatest hits set to commemorate nearly 30 years together. And that's kinda sad really. Still it's out there if anybody needs it.

This is quite a lovely compilation of all sorts of rarities that the Virgin Prunes had done in their lifespan. And what results too. Greylight, King of Junk and The Faculties Of A Broken Heart ( a remix of Baby Turns Blue ) are quite simply astounding. It sometimes verges on the downright creepy of The Happy Dead. You'll be hard pushed to find a bad track here although if I had to pick one, The Children Are Crying would be the only one. I think to truly understand this you just have to listen to this for yourself because it is near indescribable trying to explain the unexplainable

I got this on my travels in Finland and have been quietly impressed by the music on it. As has been mentioned here, Porcupine Tree seem to be the middle ground between The Orb and Pink Floyd which is no bad thing. The music is very light, airy and definitely trippy too ( without the need of any psychedelic drugs I may add too ). I quite enjoy the random dialogue snippets as this makes it seem/sound a bit more of a scientific experimentation set to music. If you do like your psychedelic music more musically trippy than lyrically - this is as good a place to go for your dosage.

Speaker 1: "I quite like the way Philip Glass has taken the very context of pop music and married it with the grandiose elements of classical music and made something entirely new with the two. I think it's a very clear and clever arrangement which forces us to think of the boundaries in music and how it transcends the triviality of such genres."Speaker 2: "I'm sorry but I just find that preposterous. Obviously that's his main aim is to find the perfect counterpoint between classical and pop music and it's an intelligent idea but ultimately pointless....."S1: "Come now, it's a work of genius."S2: "I think not.....and genius is not something I'd use lightly as you have on many occasions. I get the impression you are easily amused. Take Philip Glass' compositions on merit and they are very good....granted his use of minimalism can grate on the listener but essentially there is something in them that makes them unique. With this he has merely washed out his sound and dumbed down the arrangements so that they carefully accompany the singers with which he has in mind. And for me that's just not acceptable. Similarly David Byrne is a great singer who uses his songs powerfully and with a great deal of thought seems blocked out somewhat. It seems as if both are compromised and as musicians that seems a total failure."S1: "But you always look on the whole idea of musicians compromised and the arrangements as something of vital importance. Can't you take it for what it is and that is that it gives a good ambience of some sort. And there are plenty more singers in this then just David Byrne."S2: "I know that but even they feel stymied by this idea. They want to do something more but they are afraid and subsequently bottle it when they could really have gone out and done something. That goes for everyone there....they all feel compromised as if they don't know what they should really do. And that's terrible. As for the music itself it merely sounds as background for a meal in a restaurant for well off suburbanites such as ourselves and it's an all too knowing ploy that's used to fritter away in the background."Speaker 3: "Listen can we stop this debate about the merits of Philip Glass, the roast lamb with croutons, marinaded asparagus with Caesar salad is ready to be served. Tuck in!

Alright it's unlike a lot of his other works, and the mayhem with Spector's ego has given it an edge of notoriety which ultimately attracts a lot of people to these things. You have to say that this is an album that Cohen himself has devalued, whether rightly or wrongly is up to you. I personally think he's wrong but I can understand his point of view. Specifically when you get a gun pointed to your head after another one of Spector's egomanic/megalomanic mood had taken full control of the proceedings.But I truly do love these songs. True Love Leaves No Traces seems like a mantra Bill Clinton should take on himself. Iodine is very truthful and all too real of obsessional love and how things can quickly sour. But of course, the full blown masterpiece of comedy is Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On. There was always subtle humour in Cohen's work but here in general it's blasted to full extremes. But no matter what way you think of the song title and how hilarious it seems, he's got a point you know!I suppose this will only test the adventurous or the most willing of customers but they should enjoy it. It's not as bad as people will make it out to be and nostalgia seems to look a bit cruelly on it but it's a great album - whether you take the chance on this or not is up to yourself

Yeah this is kinda un-Orbital but it's not such a bad thing. The score that they make is creepy and it wouldn't be something you would listen to everyday ( unless you're seriously unstable ) but as a soundtrack it sounds thoroughly listenable and cohesive and not just something random thrown together. They make a good go at it and is worth the effort. It's also got this creepy ambience to it which is almost beautiful. Occasionally it gets into really noisy industrial territory so perhaps you'd have to be a big fan of that particular genre to enjoy this music. However this wouldn't be the best place to start if people are looking to get into Orbital. Look elsewhere if you are a beginner, this is only for the hardened Orbital fan ( and even then people are divided on this ).

This is pretty terrible as Hollywood films go. I had more fun watching the walls than watching this since there is nothing going on here. And by that I mean nothing interesting. The characters are completely useless. Cardboard cut outs would have acted better than this. And as the plot plods along you can't help but think when the hell does this endThe only person I really feel sorry for is Kevin Bacon. The guy is woefully underused as Meg Ryan's "intense" ex boyfriend. He gives the film a brief glimmer of hope but is then gone for almost the rest of the entire film.Save your money on something better unless you like seeing Meg Ryan have sex in a movie.....but even then that's much of a highlight when the film is as boring as can be.

Although having said that it has much darker tones and hasn't got the syrupy ending that most American films have when dealing with teenage lives.I got a friend from Holland to buy me this as it hasn't been released here in Ireland ( or the UK ) yet. As a result I'm listening to the whole thing in Dutch and have no subtitles to guide me along the way. But I can pick out the odd Dutch word here and there such as " godverdomme " " klootsak " and " dood ". But then I don't really need the subtitles. I can get the meaning ( or my interpretation of it ) without them such is the strength of the film.Rutger Hauer and Jeroen Krabbe are the usual suspects in Verhoeven's Dutch movies ( which I haven't seen but for sure I'm interested in seeing ). Here they play very small parts but they play them well. Hauer is good as Gerrard Witkamp who is the idol of the three teenage wannabe dirtbike riders. He plays the role with such cockiness that you sometimes get the feeling that he IS that person.The film takes on a darker edge when one of the bikers who had just got a contract from Honda sees his career ruined when a German tourist ( this is what it's supposed to be they say - for all I know it could have been another Dutch person ) absent mindedly throws out rubbish out of his car window and leads the biker off road. His career is ruined and effectively feels that his life has become worthlessThe gang rape scene is one of the most explicit depictions of gang rape for it's time. And it's amazing to think that in Holland you can get this on a 12 certificate while here in Ireland you'd be lucky to get an 18 certificate. But needless to say you have to a bit of a strong stomach for it all.There are some obvious scenes as well such as the boys measuring up to see who has the bigger penis. And there's one where......Nah I shouldn't say more. I'd end up ruining the film for you and that's not what you wantBut when the film plunges into so much darkness you are kinda confused at how it could come into such a happy ending. It's not a syrupy happy ending with loads of schmaltz added on.....it just IS a happy ending. A sort of signal to say " Life goes on. C'est la vie "

This is a peculiar album and usually when this is practically unavailable wherever I look and so this is one of the few times I go to the internet for a CD. I didn't actually get this from Amazon ( shock horror ) but I got it from a little indie shop called Stupido in Helsinki. I saw it everywhere I went in Finland and I was amazed that here was a shop that actually had it in abundance and for a reasonable price. Alas since I had already bought a lot of other CDs I didn't get it while I was on my holiday ( like I probably might have done had there not been a whole range of CDs I just had to buy ).Anyway I ordered from their website and sent the money away from the post and a couple of weeks later after much impatience I got the CD so I put it in knowing full well that this was a spoken word CD. Taken into account what other reviewers have said here this only made me more curious about the album. What the people say here is entirely true and all opinions are valid opinions so if you already have a stigma towards spoken word albums you might want to stay away.Now to the content. Well it's a bit hard to comprehend really if you ask me. The amount of information certainly is enlightening in a way I suppose. Whether you can form an opinion on these arguments is to ask yourself are you as well read on this stuff as Jaz. For the entire 67 minutes of this CD, his lecture is indeed mad, fuelled by conspiracy but yet intriguing and by all accounts a real mind-opener if you are willing to listen to it with an open mind. On the whole, I can't really say I can agree with him completely but then again there is, to a certain degree, an element of truth in what he says.As for the musical back up well......it's only a simple guitar riff that goes on for almost all of the disc and can get on your nerves if you wanted no musical back up or wanted more of a musical back up. But don't forget the music is not important here. It's more about Jaz's speech/rant and besides you get used to listening to it as it goes along. Although I don't know if it's just my copy but for a brief snippet midway through the speech and it has this weird cauldron of noise that scares the bejesus out of me when I hear it. It catches me unexpected every time. And then......and then normal service resumes. Was that part of the trick to make sure you were listening? I don't know but perhaps that's a good reason if anyone was dozing off in the back. Still, I can still remember hearing it and Christ it was loud and furious. Bloody hellOh and as a final part to this CD we hear a plug for the then new album Outside The Gate which for some may be the most unappealing aspect of the whole thing. In fact some may also quibble about if Jaz wanted this thing to be a non-profit making exercise why release it? Well the simple answer ( or my reasoning shall we say ) is that people may want to listen to it again to see if they can absorb it next time round. After all a lot of the speech can go over many people's heads the first time. And also new fans may also want to know the thought process or the reasoning behind the band which this may come in handy.Anyway without doubt this is perhaps for some of the more hardcore fans though having said that I'd still think that if anyone is willing to listen to this with an open mind and form an opinion from that then that would be success. They don't really have to be Killing Joke fans but then to ask that is to ask for too much but howandever........I can't make you like this record as can any of the other reviewers here. If you are interested and have an open mind to things, this can be quite a thought provoking experience. If possible, leave all prejudices behind and enjoy The Courtauld Talks

These are three live concerts recorded by uber fan Robert Quine at a few of the Velvet's concerts. The fact that these still exist despite the sound quality ( which isn't that bad really ) is remarkable and is probably one of those records that just has to be bought

Given that these tapes are still here is something of a miracle - the sound is reasonable. I wasn't expecting perfect quality but it's close enough ( and given these are 30 years old that's pretty good going ).I don't need to say anymore about this - I'll let the rest do the talking

The tracks here are horrible NIN/Smashing Pumpkins rip off songs . This is without a shadow of a doubt humiliating to listen to . Trying to be hip with todays kids is just not working . Of course if you are a big fan of Numan you will love this . If you are a goth - you might like this but in the end you can't help but complain and the substandard lyrics ( they're worse than NIN's for god sake ( and that takes a bit of beating ))However if my prejudices anger you - I'm sorry . It's just that this album to me sounded appalling . By all means if you are intending to buy it - fair enough - but if you hate it - don't say I didn't warn you

As is the English way at the moment, there is a huge mass of hysteria garnered to anybody who gets a record contract at the moment. Tom Vek is apparently hailed as " the new Beck." It may be just me but I think they hail him that because he recorded his record in a garage and " Hey what d'ya know, their names rhyme!"So how good is the album then? Well the first four tracks are awesome, single-handedly out-doing what most retro acts have been trying to do all along. After that the results are a bit hit and miss. The lyrics become a little bit ropey and the overall effect is one of same old-same old.Still there is time for him to improve and there is a feeling with him that you don't quite know what he will do next. Because even though he has been hailed as the new Beck, he has been pretty low-key unlike some that are out and about today. Got to see where he's going first but overall, yes he could be one of the survivors in the crash-and-burn industry of today

This is the newest release from Plastikman. Recently I've gone back to my first love of techno music and was reading on this artist - Richie Hawtin in his Plastikman disguise - to see what was said. Mainly good stuff all roundI decided to pick this one up ( considering it was the cheapest of his releases ( and new as well )) and I have to admit at first I thought &quot; What's all the fuss about this guy then? Because it was difficult because on first listen there's barely anything to hold your attention. And what's more there's only one bass and a drum you'll hear for the whole album. Not very exciting really is it?Well if you dig deeper into it, if your patience can stay with it, it has more to it. Nokia's mobile coming in on one track ( he makes it sound like if it's coming in on an ocean ) and if you listen VERY closely you'll hear a melody but it is hidden so deep beneath the bassline that most people will think it doesn't exist.Oh yes and the vocals......well if you can think of a stalker phoning you with his voice distorted then you pretty much get the idea. It adds to the whole effect of what he's actually saying.Apparently this was recorded when Richie was on the verge of a mental breakdown and given to this I can fully understand this by listening to music. It's quite possibly the most difficult album you'll ever experience because you feel that there's nothing going on really but there's so much more just hidden beneath the surface.Give it a go but give it time - it's not something you're going to fall in love with instantly but if and when it does it becomes hypnotized. But that's for you to decide

Well there's not much else I can say about this album. It truly is one of those great pleasures to listen to these EPs and marvel at their magnificence. With music like this you can forgive the Cocteau's reluctance to talk about their music because in a way it speaks for itself. And there's not one review, in my opinion, that can speak of this highly enough. Because words aren't needed for this at all.Just listen and you will enjoy

This is horrible. Absolutely f***ing horrible. Take post-punk/synth pop classics and put them through a shredder/blender of bossanova and 60s pop and what have you got? A total mess. Currently being hyped as an " album that would melt any cold post punk's heart." Which is complete rubbish. This is sacrilege of the highest degree. Now if people get into Joy Division and Depeche Mode because of this - that's all very well and I welcome anyone on board. But please, this CD is an insult to those classics. Some may see it as a good idea ( and I admit it does have a good nice novelty factor ) but when you strip away the novelty factor what you have is a very shallow record devoid of the emotion that was put into the original recordings ( OK I'll be the first one to admit that there's not much emotion in DM's happy-clappy Just Can't Get Enough ).Call me a musical purist if you will but some things should never be tampered with

I have to be honest, sometimes Roger Waters' lyrics just are annoying at times and can be used as tool to mock him. As he croaks &quot; Old timer who you gonna kill next?&quot; Some will believe he will if he would just shut up! It can be a hard time taking his views seriouslyBut that's the whole deal with Waters - you either love him or you hate him. There's nothing inbetween really. I must say I hated this album on first listen. Mocking his voice, some of his lyrics and so on. But given time my opinion has changed. It's nowhere near the greats that he produced with Pink Floyd but you should never expect him to do that.What we get here from Waters is the essential mix of all that he hates about the modern world and TV is the main ingredient. This would be a boring exercise in tedium had it not had the one thing needed to boost this - humour! And there is a fair bit of it here but only if you consider Roger's particular sense of humour funny. It's particularly caustic and probably wouldn't seem very funny to some politically correct conscious people but what do you expect?Highlighting songs is useless because they're to all gel as one really and not otherwise. Although towards the end the songs tend to drag on a little ( hence the 4 stars ) but overall this is a good album and possibly the only Roger Waters album you need if you aren't particularly bothered by the rest

I bought this in a sale in Tower Records ( 5 ) and when I first listened to it I thought it was diabolical. Half the tracks were horrible and half were really weird. I promptly didn't play this for a long time and it was only a couple of weeks ago I played this again and surprisingly enough it really gelled as an album on a whole. It's got some good things going. It can be irritating sometimes but generally the album's a pleasure to listen to. Pity that this album got turned up on first release but then on first listen I could understand why. A surprising rare treasure that should be enjoyed

Unfortunately you cannot seperate the music from the stories that have been told about Syd. There was help from his former pals at Pink Floyd and while some prefer the &quot;nakedness&quot; of The Madcap Laughs I do prefer this album. Yes it does kinda feel like a masking of Syd's problems and sometimes Syd can barely strum a note but there's a feeling you get in the song Dominoes that hits harder than anything else. Syd sounds depressed and sings with an utter hatred that's not apparent in songs these days. He doesn't even want to sing the song and it's all the more effective. It does seem like such a shocking waste that Syd went the way he did. Some songs Syd sings is in on his own tune while the others are trying to stay with him and in a sense that perfectly describes him really - he was walking away from it all and being in his own world. It's confusing and sometimes perhaps scary but this is Syd's world and it really is hard not to feel sorry for him. As the Pink Floyd song goes &quot; Shine on you crazy diamond &quot;

Yes I do know that sounds patently ridiculous given their backcatalogue but it's true. Music from a play and the instruments are book-binding material! Book-binding material? Surely that cannot work. But then like most Neubauten stuff it actually does for some strange reason. As it skitters around while the actors play their parts which I have no idea what they're saying most of the time apart from some women chanting. It still draws the listener in despite the fact if you can't speak the language too good. An odd and unexpected joy to listen to. It actually makes me wish I had seen that play! Oh well.....better luck ( look? ) next time

This a very difficult album to take ( then again what Diamanda album isn't difficult ). Her 4 octave voice is so convincing on it's own that you would be hard pressed but just submitting yourself as a slave to her. Her voice is that really that powerful. The only thing though is that about this album is that it is a vocal acrobatic work out for her. There's nothing else but her voice and when it hits the right notes.....what's left for you is to shrivel up in the corner of your bedroom and pray that her voice doesn't eat you up alive.Venture if you dare but be warned.......Mummy ain't here to save you

This is a two CD set of Neubauten's more harsher moments. Occasionally beautiful, occasionally irritating and of course occasionally that little bit scary. I just saw them live yesterday and whatever about them &quot; mellowing out &quot; ( which on evidence of their latest albums you would think so ) - live they're still one hell of a noisy band. Still this is recommended to all industrial connoiseurs ( whereever they are ) and that's about it really. Although one last thing - was two CDs really necessary? It easily could have got by on one but I'm not going to complain on that one

Dark, fierce , paranoid and extremely scary. If this doesn't sound like the album for you then continue elsewhere . If it is however you are in luck. This was to be the final concert that Throbbing Gristle would play under the moniker Throbbing Gristle before disbanding into Psychic TV, Coil and other such projects.The music here is blurred on first listen. This is due to the fact that the concert was recorded on tape and the sound resembles much more a chainsaw blurting it's terrible noise and Genesis P-Orridge's moaning drones and yelps make it seem like some guy's head has been decapitated. Unfriendly at best. What probably makes it even more bizarre is that you can hear what the crowd are saying. Now usually that's nothing more than chanting the band's name but TG go further. They make it sound like people have come to the slaughterhouse to see who the next victim is. And they talk about their daily routines as well. I think if I had have been there I might have just stumbled outside for a minute just to regain some sort of consciousness out of this nausea.Now that I've given it repeated listens it's easier to hear the music and it's almost numbed out the paranoid feelings I had about this album. But I have to admit for a band like TG to make me feel so paranoid as that and make me envision music that extreme is something unique. This album is not for everyone, easily so, but those who like their music extreme and freakish will definitely enjoy this album

On something that'll scare you senseless. Having bought Schrei X finally after some reservations ( did I really want to be scared by that voice of hers was the main worry ) I bought it and although I didn't really like it I still held out and tried one more because I had to have this one for some reason. It kinda felt if I was a man or a wuss. And finally I parted my cash with this. This isn't easy listening now of course but it has the upper hand because it is filled with atmospheric synth work and progresses to the final track. It may be hard getting through it all......in fact I'd recommend if you take it in small doses if possible but there's no denying that she has a wonderful ( if undeniably chilling ) all that's left for you is to test this out.....if you have enough balls to that is

I think Alec says it all really - it does work well as an isolated sort of record. It doesn't really feel like a live record at all. And this is what might frustrate you at first listen. Where is the crowd? Why isn't there anything being said? What the hell is happening? These are the sort of things you'll probably expect when coming to something like a live album like this. He probably could have released this without mentioning it was live and it would have gone beyond me.The tracks are, as Alec said, pretty psychedelic. Nothing shows that off better than The Gameboy Offshow. So instantly addictive and goddamn groovy are the synths that it's impossible to do anything else but to listen to it and nothing else! It's that good!It's probably one of the most played live albums I've got because of the way it doesn't feel like a live album. And that is something special. Too bad his next album is going to be something similar to CD1 of Intelligence and Sacrifice but ah, as long as this CD survives.....I will have no problem

Merely regarded as one of the pre-Black Celebration albums I'm afraid that this album may go unnoticed to all but the die-hard fans. True enough it's not something as glorious as Black Celebration and Violator but it is intriguing how far they had come from annoying Toytown disco that was Speak & Spell ( and that was only 2 years before )OK, the reprise of Everything Counts is like listening to Tetris and Pipeline does sound a bit dodgy but it's not the worst. There's Work Hard and Told You So are pretty terrible but it flows so well that all is forgiven.The best song on here is the closer And Then.... which sounds like one of those possible hands in the air moments....it feels beautiful and serene and possibly almost converts you into being a Communist....but then you read back on history and then you remember that it's not so good at all. But a great song nonetheless.Also Alan Wilder's lyrical contribution are also good and musically beautiful.One that should be enjoyed only if you really love Depeche Mode and all it's glory. If you are new to the game it really is probably better off starting with the two Singles collections. That way you kinda know what to expect

Sadomasochism. Admittedly I have no idea what's going on or how the hell he gets the noises out of his machines. But it works well. Effectively enough to make this an unsettling mixture of noise and music ( though then again it could just be noise )Have to say I was intrigued by the liner notes giving a detailed account about the different forms of sadomasochism from the Western World and how it infiltrated Japan and how Japanese people made their own types of s+m. Extremely interesting if you feel like reading them. Of course it shows pictures and drawings as well to help illustrate the idea behind them. Perhaps giving a few kinky ideas for lovers everywhere......just be careful though, alright?It's not a total noise blast like what I heard from samples of Pulse Demon.....it's a little more pleasant but having said that it's still an abrasive mix and can create a god almighty racket but this is Merzbow and that's what we expect, don't we?I'm not going to lie and say everyone should try this - that would be an insane thought. All I will say is if you feel adventurous enough to get this album - go ahead - if not, I wouldn't stand in your way in whatever other purchase you make

This is just too addictive. As soon as I put this on thinking &quot; Nah just one track is all I need &quot; I end up playing the whole album and it's amazing how much the song has mutated many times over the course of the album. Given what I've heard it would be fun listening to the 30 minute live version but I guess that would have to found on Kazaa or something like that. When I bought this I thought it would be terrible given that most fans of Wire's punk period don't really know what to make of this. I can pretty much say that I shouldn't have worried ( although I still have some doubts on the other synthy stuff they have ). But this is good, really good and as I've said before so addictive

It is worth having as there are 2 tracks here you won't find anywhere else plus 2 new versions of Yashar and Taxi Music and finally 2 songs that would later find themselves on The Crackdown. All in all it's good and you can really get into them but the problem is that the CD is too short.....you don't really get a thorough feel for the songs and the feel of the album because it's over before you can really get into it......they really should have put the rest of the gig on the CD because that way there would be more of an atmosphere surrounding the songs but as it is you'll have to make do with 6 rather good songs but it would have been better to have just a little bit more

Jarre comes up with a subtle blend of electronics and jazz on this album. The album sounds like it could be the soundtrack to a murder mystery at times and the sound is distinctively Jean Michel.

This is a great CD of EPs that collected Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner's work from the mid 90s. It's a worthwhile collection of songs that make it an interesting collection of songs. They do need a bit of time to get used to but they are worth the money. Those that have the EPs already ( like the reviewer below ) may just skip buying this because they already have the songs. But those who don't and are willing to pay for this album will not be disappointed

As it stands this is a highly listenable collection of cod-psychedelia songs but there's a slightly uneasy feeling listening to this. If you felt that The Shamen were their best at being astral technoid hippies then by all means this album is not for you. This tends to be a little dour and well you can't help but feel that it stinks a little of being a bunch of Luddites playing the standard rock fare. Indeed it's reminiscent of a lot of 60s psychedelia and it brought in many bands such as The Stone Roses and The Happy Mondays but......it's difficult to love really. It feels like they're being a rather anaemic tribute band to Pink Floyd and the 13th Floor Elevators with a side dish of The Cure just to make them feel a little more contemporary and more favourable to the indie world.Still I can't fault Through With You which is good in any way, shape or form, I Don't Like is also another one that stands out. But the one that really stands out is the bonus track Christopher Mayhew Says A Lot, it really begins to show the way The Shamen were turning and is a hell of a lot more interesting. The sample behind the song actually has a rather neat story attached. In the 1950s, a politician called Christopher Mayhew, under supervision of doctors took mescaline live on TV and then described the effects he was having as it happened. So he would be asked " Are you here now? " " Yes I'm here. No, wait, I'm off somewhere else now!" Truly remarkable. I doubt we'll see the like of that on TV ever. Surely some TV station in Britain has it lying around in the archives section.But to get to the point of this album, this is an interesting curiosity for all Shamen fans. You may enjoy this album but it's far from their best if you ask me

It is said by the great man himself that this is the closest he has ever got to making a sort of autobiographical film &quot; and I don't want to come any closer &quot; he feels. And in some respects you have to agree with him. The acting all round is superb and unlike in many of Cronenberg's films where the actors are almost wooden in their performance, none of them here are wooden in their performances. There's a sense of realism in this which you won't get from any other Cronenberg film. There's always a creepy sense &quot; of what might happen &quot; than the &quot; wham bam you're dead &quot; sort of horror movieYou don't really need me to tell you the story of the film since many others have commented on it. But I will say this is that Oliver Reed plays his part well. There's always an underlying threat of menace in his voice even when he's trying to convince Frank that he's on his side ( although you probably wouldn't think it at the time )And as for those side effects that these people have while in his therapy are truly one of the most revolting things you'll ever see. Even though this film is menacingly restrained yet emotional, it'll take a strong stomach to see one of the more gruesome scenes of the film ( although it ain't as gruesome as Scanners or Videodrome )However this is a film that has to be watched purely being for the reason that this maybe the only time that Cronenberg makes a highly personal movie.

All the hype surrounding Felt Mountain was lost on me. I thought it was completely empty &quot; brain-melt &quot; music. It just didn't have any substance for me. But of course it was critically acclaimed and sold a fair few so it has obviously got it's fair few admirers.So I completely ignored them like I always do when I don't like something and then I see the Strict Machine on MTV and it was hard not to think &quot; Wow.&quot; This was a major transformation and that 80s sounding keyboard just really dug in and the chorus was really infectious. The more I read about the gigs I thought, &quot; I'm missing out on something here &quot; so inevitably I bought thisThe tracks here are similar in feel but it's not completely settled. At times it does feel rather disjointed but at other times it flows well. Perhaps that was the point. It's good to see that there are artists/musicians willing to test themselves to see how diverse they really can be. At times some might mistake this album for an Add N To X album if it were not for Alison Goldfrapp's vocals.If you liked Felt Mountain, you may feel a little bit disappointed with this if you wanted another of the same. If you're not particularly bothered on the other hand this could be just the thing for you but this leaves me with one particular question - what's their next album going to sound like?

At 20 minutes this single is pretty and hypnotic but it needs a couple more tracks to make a real impact but for what it is it deserves to be listened to. Those interested in Add N to X and/or Fuxa should be interested in this but ultimately it's too short for my likingIt does make me interested to see what Fuxa sound like though so maybe it has something

First off I got this CD by mistake! I thought I had bought Trans Am's Futureworld and in the end had got this by accident. But I'm pretty open towards any kind of music within reason. Having said that I put this on and in all honesty, this music absolutely scared me......I had expected sort of jokey electro-rock but instead was getting ritualistic Ancient Egyptian tribal music. It was a completely numbing experience. The sparse flute melded together with spidery bass guitar work and hints of electronics and so on created this haunting and haunted past that created the vision of the glory days of the pyramids, of Tutankhamun and other such tales that have passed into legend. Added to that that the vocals are spoken in a spooky, distorted way that and it completes the effect that it is one of the most chilling things you'll ever hear. Your blood chills when listening to this.It's an astounding album, quite astonishing that music can conjured up quite like this. It sounds unlike anything that came before it and since it was first conceived. In all, it sounds totally removed from any sense of time that you can identify with. It exists completely within it's own realm. It makes absolutely no concessions to anything or anyone. It just is. There's no other way of putting it, it lives outside of what we are accustomed to. And for that to happen, takes some courage, guts and determination. If you want a record that's outside the usual and quite unlike anything else, this is the one for you. In the end, it's the most beautiful mistake you could ever make!

I just bought this for Wicked Game and well to relive the video for it in my head ( if I remember correctly it was him and Helena Christensen on a beach and it was in black and white ). And Christ what a video it was. Implanted in my brain for a long long time nowAnyway....getting back to reality here now this collection of songs are sweetly poised and delicate and gently remind us of the soft underside that obsession can possess.Talking of this album has reminded me of that video again and I'll stop while I'm ahead

Can't say I'm surprised really because neither do I!One guy on the video ( well my version of it ( which has two versions of the film ))says that this is a film about the sex-war and yada yada ya while another reviewer says this film is " indefinable "......so hold on if even a reviewer thinks this film is indefinable than what chance do we have of knowing......effectively zilch!We may have our own opinions on this film but the thing with this is that each is valid. If you hate this film for the basic fact that it didn't make sense.....you would be right because it effectively doesn'tSo why watch it? As funny as this may seem I don't really have an answer for that question. Blind fascination perhaps, that's all!As I was saying I have two versions of this. One that Bunuel used with the soundtrack of Wagner's Tristan Und Isolde, which you might find isn't fitting with the film ( perhaps that's the whole point ). The other soundtrack is made by Mauriccio Kagel which is far more experimental and more jarring to the person who watches the film.I don't know which version is used on the version that is sold to Americans.....neither do I know what the other film on the American version is like. I am only reviewing Un Chien Andalou - if I ever get the chance to review the other film I'll give my thoughts on that film as always

This is the pinnacle of Depeche Mode's career ( well before Violator ) and is their darkest album ( arguably ). From Black Celebration to Question Of Time to the Stripped remix ( Breathing in Fumes ) this album is for anyone who likes DM at their moodiest

If you want something that sounds experimental go and buy it but they're on the Heart and Soul Box set so it's become worthless but if want it more compact than the Heart and Soul box set ( and I can fully understand ) then it is for youBy the way the live set is pretty good even if you do hear a few mistakes

This is quite possibly the essential Ministry record. Mainly because Jesus Built My Hotrod is on it. But this is grinding, powerful and mechanic. If any record dispels their synth pop past it's this record ( should I have said that ).

The story of this film revolves around 4 people - Karin, who suffers from schizophrenia, Martin, Karin's husband, a doctor who watches helplessly as she slips deeper into the illness, David, Karin's father, an author who watches with a creeping sense of detachment to which he is horrified of and Minus, a young 17 year old boy with his life ahead of him yet he feels neglected.When we first see the four arrive, Karin in particular, seems fresh and bubbly, you would hardly notice anything at all. But as the film progresses you see her moods begin to darken as she progressively moves from happy to sad to creepy within quick succession. The crucial point in the film is when Karin notices that her father has been keeping a diary of her mental disintegration for his own private use as he may " use her " as an idea for a novel he is thinking of writing in future.Feeling as though she can't trust her father, and within time, her feelings for her husband slowly dwindle. The only person she can trust is poor Minus, her brother. Minus doesn't know what to do or even know how to handle Karin's visions and the voices that she hears. She is convinced that God is on the other side of the wall and that he will appear soon. This genuinely unsettles Minus and, under instructions leaves, but not without Karin yelling for the way he tiptoes out. He goes out the door for a few minutes and when he comes back to open the door, she is there in front of him and her mood has changed as if the bizarre happenings of two minutes ago had never happened.What is done very well is that what Karin says she sees, the audience can not see at all but you hear slight whispers faintly during one scene which makes this film all the more believeable. Also point of note is the house they live in, which looks very rundown, very shabby......perhaps it was not such a good idea to come to the house as it gives hints as to what might have happened in the past especially for someone whose mental state is in such a fragile state of affairs.I won't give too much more away, as I may have spoiled the movie for you but in the notes that Bergman wrote himself, he says that he is uneasy watching this film and that there were a lot of mistakes made and that the film was not "real" but played "by a trickster." He makes the point that the film took on a musical quality and that the person who acted in Karin was the only one who hit the notes right. He does state though that the whole acting team played well but it was the fault of him and his crew that let it down in some ways. While I think he's being too harsh on himself, I can emphathize/sympathize with the way he feels, especially given the background he gives on the making of this film which I will leave you to read over. I think it was an extract of his autobiography or something, must check that out.Overall, I think the film is a powerful movie, one that tries to show the intensity of emotions, even in a state of detachment and also a sort of frailty not only in mental capacity in how it can dissolve but also of human understanding, love, relationships and of religion. It may not be the most uplifting movie you'll ever see but it is a movie nonetheless that in some way, may outline harsh lessons in life.

The one thing that struck me when first listening to the album was how jittery it sounded. The guitars sounded like they were going to explode at any minute....the samples were zooming in from all over the place....it almost sounded like total chaos was in progress. But the more you listen to this, the more you see how much effort went into it. It's also impossibly funky too. In the line between the magnificent Fear of Music and it's more successful follow up Remain in Light....this certainly feels like a jigsaw piece that fits in explaining the slight transition that occured during the making of the album. Having said that, it would be foolish to dismiss this as something that happened inbetween two Talking Heads albums. To do that would be to diminish its status. Really it's a collective, collaborative masterpiece. The amount of consideration that went into it and yet how spontaneous it all sounds is nothing short of amazing. It is the sort of album that everyone should own at least.

Now this seems to be a bit of a cult album among some Shamen fans - they see it as a perfect antidote to the Ebeneezer Goode anthem that tortured the charts for a long time . Personally I find this antidote a bit hard to swallow . A couple of the pop tracks are a bit bland and tasteless , the more experimental tracks are even more varied in terms of how good or bad they are . Some are pretty dark and trippy but the others just verge on the brink of completely out there , a bit too much for my liking ( and I have to admit that is something of an achievement ). The second CD follows in a similar vein . Explore by all means but if you don't like it I can understand you as I'm not sure about it eitherOne to buy only if you want to

No other album takes as much glee from scraping through your defences, ripping up your romantic thoughts and generally just pissing on your ideals quite as much as Why Bother? by ADULT. The album right from the start crawls into your nervous system with a caustic sound and being gleefully sadistic in the process. Nicola Kuperus' vocal yelps only add to the air of sinister joy of other's misfortune and giving the opinion that if you were near them, you were the disease that needed to be rid of. But don't let my description scare you off, this album is great to listen to and one of the very few these days that has the energy and conviction to pull things off. While nothing can be really termed "innovative" these days, ADULT. are out there on their own doing what they want and couldn't care less for any demands as to demand is to compromise. A truly refreshing band in these days when everyone else just wants to play it safe.

Admittedly where I am this is cheap ( 9 - and even then I got in on discount ) and what I got was not pretty. The tape that Mark E. Smith has of this seems to nearly give up the ghost. There are some nice moments on this though. Enough to inquire investigation over some of their other material ( admittedly I'm new to the game ) but you have to bear with the terrible sound quality. However given that this is MES we're talking about, the front cover says all - if you don't like it, this is what I think of ya anywayStill only one for possible diehards but the price Amazon here is a little off-putting nonetheless

This is a bit too technical for it's own good. The songs just don't seem to click into place like they should do. The songs themselves are great but yet there's something missing. And perhaps technology has got a lot to answer for. Sure technology is great in music and can be fun to listen to. But when you bring it forward into rock music in any sort of form....it takes away from the passion of what was there. It seems sterile and just doesn't feel the same. Take NIN for example. Many people take NIN's music as very passionate and yes to a degree the lyrics are very passionate but what makes NIN so unlistenable these days is that the increasing use of technology that Reznor uses is sucking up all the emotions until it becomes worthless ( and OK the lyrics are a tad bit childish but that's besides the point )Perhaps I should have known the songs Kidney Bingos and The Queen of Ur and The King of Um before I bought this album since it might but only might give me a better feeling for this but then it might notI say technology can be fun to listen to....but only in keyboards because despite what some people might say there can be quite a bit of emotional depth in some electronic music....Moby has shown that to a widespread audience. Bring technology into a more rock audience and it loses it's appealI don't know - maybe more listens are required but I've listened to it a lot and there's still no getting in. Maybe their next album will be electronic - who knows? For Wire always have a card up their sleeve

Here is a review I wrote when I was in Holland. It became the perfect cure after the somewhat horrible mess that occured during the end of the trip. It grew on me quite a bit and at times the lyrics are fairly hilarious such as " Some people go down on me / I hope they like what they see "Incidentally I lost the CD to this album and I want to get it back but I can always buy it again when I have the time as it is a terrific albumAnyway here is that review" This has been unfairly treated as the band's worst album which I think would be more suited to their most recent album , Get Ready . Having said that I give it four stars for the fact that it is not an album that most New Order fans can take . If you were a fan of Joy Division and also New Order this would be essential although you do notice the flaws in the album . But then again I wonder how would I feel if I were in there shoes and Martin Hannett would be yelling to make the music " more helium like ".There are times when you feel that Barney is scared when he sings as there is this nervousness in his voice signalling that if he didn't sound like Ian Curtis , Martin would possibly yell at him and add on effects to make him sound like Ian .Overall this album is very good . Flawed yes but under those circumstances and also with Martin Hannett still shocked that Ian was gone and starting his own decline , it's little wonder that the end result came out as it did . But you have to applaud the guys for the work they did under the trauma they went through . But saying that , buy this album if you love Joy Division and wondered how they came through and survived to this day . If you cannot tolerate Joy Division , stick to the others - this maybe a bit too much doom and gloom for your liking "

Well well well, what have we here! This supposedly is the " worst " Ministry record which is something I can't understand. There's brilliant use of guitars and what's more it's texturally more layered than Psalm 69 which for all it's charm was more of a metal album for robots. People complain about the lyrics in some cases but Ministry were not one for deep intellectual lyrics a la Billy Corgan, they were here to rock your brains out! Sure it has a few bad songs but what album doesn't? You got to reconsider this album - it could be one of the best albums Ministry album put out!

This record is nothing short of brilliant. Obviously you will have heard of the different personalities between Micheal Rother and Klaus Dinger. One favoured a more laid back, languid, mellow pace to his songs ( Rother ) while the other wanted a more all out assault on the listener ( Dinger ). This album catches that beautifully and balances either side out very well. While side 1 has soothing ( all 3 songs of side 1 ), almost spacy feel to the music, the second ( again 3 songs ) is more aggressive but still retains a certain spaciness to it. The result shows that whatever/despite the overall differences between Rother and Dinger in their approaches and their personalities, they could still make great music together. An album recommended without hesitation

This compilation was released termed as the definitive Devo collection and in some ways it has to be viewed as somewhat of a success. Unfortunately though the second CD is horrible - it shows the band degenerating into an awful novelties band. But viewed on the bands de-evolution process it's hard to fault really because it seems like it was going to happen anyway and it seems to click with the band's philosophy. Disc 1 however is fantastic and it shows everything that was great about Devo in the first place but when you place it next to Disc 2 you can see where everything went.If you're new to Devo I recommend Hot Potatoes or any of the single CD best-of's. They capture the band at it's peak. Otherwise this is more of a die-hard venture although it's still worth it for those tracks you'd have thought you could only get on their videos

This book is charming , darkly humourous and at times saddening . The tale of the Lisbon girls is a tragedy that is told as if you were a next door neighbour . It does tell you how or why the girls had committed suicide . The way they were locked up in the house 24/7 shows the frustration at how strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon were . One to enjoy if you like this sort of thing

This is music at it's most haunting and extreme. The music is harsh and Liz Fraser's voice may be a little uncertain but it only adds to the frightening element this album has to offer. Definite highlights are Wax And Wane, But I'm Not and Blind Dumb Deaf. Not for the faint hearted and definitely not for those who prefer Cocteau Twins' later material

Despite the mastering Lou gave to some of those Velvet Underground tracks ( is it just me or did he put his vocals up higher into the mix ), I find this a rather solid best-of collection. It's a rather neat and tidy collection for those willing to buy this collection. Frankly I see this collection is better than the recent NYC Man with the added crap remix of Sattelite of Love which is here in it's original format ( and best ). I say this is better because I think you get a better feel for all the tracks and you get a more rounded idea of the personality that was put into the records. It's worth a try to see the many different levels/facets of Lou Reed's work on two compact discs. As the man himself says " try it."

OK it may not be flawless but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. The live tracks could've been negotiated better, I'll grant that but I still find it fascinating. There's plenty on here to marvel about. I don't think I can add much to what's been already said but it's definitely the definitive collection to get into The Yardbirds. A worthwhile purchase

This is going to be a hard DVD to review. Random political images spliced with band shots and various weird locations make it very odd, sometimes disconcerting and as hard to review as it is trying to make out what's the point in the videos. Still the music is very good and after watching it a few times it actually is pretty damn good. Still don't ask me what it is I should be deciphering out of it. The Dadaists are making me feel dizzy!

Others have described the songs with more detail than I ever could but for raw passion, integrity, grit, determination and bloody mindedness, this album reaches places where few bands have succeeded in achieving. The Manics' haven't always been this good or even this consistent but here the intensity is relentless and that can be only a good thing. Unfortunately Richey Edwards went missing to which he hasn't been found. The case still remains open even though by now the right thing would be to let it be. However you have to respect the wishes of Richey's family.The US mix of this CD isn't really all that much. It gives you clarity but that was never the point of the album. If you want to put it pretentiously, it underlines the murky goings on in everyday life. Though having said that I know one guy who felt it was a bit of an improvement to the CD but I'm not sure. You may feel otherwise.The DVD is an assorted mixture of TV sessions including that Top of The Pops session and a rare video. All good but the interview is the most interesting given that the band admit themselves that they haven't made anything as good as that in the 11 years since this album was made and they released this as way of closure on the Richey saga.Well worth the money - non Manics fans may enjoy this more than they would of the others ( which I admit myself ). Manics fans will love this no matter what. And.....well a fitting tribute to Richey as well. There's nothing left to say

I could blather on about this album for a good while and since the other reviewers take you into a more in depth analysis of such an extraordinary album I'll just say this venture into minimalism is incredibly relaxing. While listening to it subconciously you seem to pick out tunes even when it sounds to be incredibly cluttered. Gradually if you're still listening by the time you pop the second CD, it becomes less aggressive, less cluttered and more peaceful, calming, tranquil and then picks the pace up yet again but still sound somewhat slightly different all the time. It's a sheer masterclass of beauty. I hate using words like that normally because it usually makes you sound like a pompous fool but this however deserves the term. It's quite simply astonishing and if you feel overly frustrated or exhausted with your life, this could prove to be the perfect tonic for those with an open mind towards music. It's a pure aural pleasure. Surrender subconsciously and the rewards are great!

Admittedly when I first heard this I thought, " Is that all? Christ, what do people see in this." Just two tracks winding and winding up with different instruments used to different effects and I was left thoroughly unsatisfied but then I gave this another listen to just recently and if you treat it as a normal record it actually works fine. It is a bit of a journey and quite a pleasurable one at that too! It's just that you kinda have to lower your expectations for this to really work. And I suppose given that I heard Tubular Bells 2 when I was little my expectations for TB1 were great given that I loved listening to TB2. It's not perfect ( but then Mike for god sake don't tamper with it ( and we all know you have )) but then that is its charm

Never have cartoons made a better point than in Ren from the Ren and Stimpy showThis film is a rather monotonous look on the morbidity of death. It ain't the prettiest of pictures to watch ( although you kinda know that ). The commentary is like a big joke really. When the presenter tries to look fearsome he looks like a goofball trying to play a psychotic doctor whose " fascination with the artform " of death is hilarious. After a half an hour you become numb to the images of death that surround this movie. Weak stomachs are not something you should have watching this movie. And yeah parts of it are fake but even still they do a pretty good job at grossing you outFor those who love this movie - maybe therapy is required!

Like the band I've never seen the film - in fact I bought this album because it was so cheap - 9 ! I was absolutely amazed when I heard it that I thought that I needed another album of theirs and quick . I went out to get Journey For A Burning Brain so as I could get more .But back to this album - well I can't say much more - it was simply astonishing ..... to think that they had never watched the movie at all and made music this intense is really outstanding . To show how good this was ( and this is my own way of knowing an album is good ) was when you hear people telling me to turn off the CD because the music was freaking them out .Worth every last cent in your bank

Released in 1989, this is almost the kind of Shamen most fans know and love. Therefore it's a radical change they made with this album. Throwing away the psychedelic indie rock they had used on the album Drop. And what a difference! Whereas Drop was more of the usual dour indie rock that you get no matter where you go. This, at the time, was something slightly different. It also showed that the band had a sense of humour. Admittedly you may want to have your sense of humour completely black. It's amazing to hear televangelists sounding completely unhinged to the point of being insane ( " GOD WILL DESTROY RUSSIA " ) - admittedly such hatred was understandable but there are some people who take things too far....! And for anyone who moans about getting biased reports from TV and newspapers, Misinformation will surely give you a chuckle. In fact, despite some of its politics being completely dated ( Russia, The Cold War etc. ) there are elements that surely hit home to some disenchanted people.But it's not all doom and gloom - there are songs to lift you up and make you feel good. They wanted to change from being politics to partying.....but again at the time of these raves that were going on, these were intensely political statements itself. So it's funny, the album comes across as a really big political statement even though the songs about partying and drugs seem......well they seem normal these days....the edge has been taken off them slightly.Most Shamen fans will see this as a transitional album to bigger and better things. And while some tracks do feel a bit off ( the start of Yellow Cellophane Day really doesn't do anything ), there are many delights to be found here that won't disappoint.

Admittedly I'm no expert at jazz and wouldn't know where to start with who plays what and all that ( forgive me ). But I do like this CD. I do like each of the sounds that each one contributes. They mesh well for that late-night easy listening on the radio. It Never Entered My Mind sounds so sweet and Trane's Blues does really sound good. It kinda feels a bit mournful in places but the overall effect is really lovely. Great to relax to when you've had a hard day and want an easy stress-free night.

The amount of new music offered here is too much to get down here on this review. Pan Sonic provide excitement, aggrevation, thoughtfulness and chill-out in equal measures. Sometimes the sounds they come up with are like motorbikes racing along at ultra-high speed. Listening to these tracks you just wonder how they can consistently come up with so much stuff. It's a treat for fans either of the band or electro-noise. And with that, I really don't think I can wax lyrical about this album anymore. Not every track here is a winner but.....with the amount of stuff there is, you'll be sure to find something you like if not most of it. That's all I think I can say.

Remix albums are always a dodgy affair - there's no question about that . This album though is nice and has a somewhat techno feel towards it . It makes for an intriguing goth/techno feel to it which strangely works . If you are up for hearing songs shown in a different light then by all means buy the album today . I did and I didn't regret it

Verhoeven's last Dutch movie was made out of spite. Increasingly lambasted for his films in his native Holland for being too perverted and desperate to make the move to Hollywood, this was the movie he made to show off potential executives in the USA. There were movie offers that he was interested in, in America, but due to one reason or another, he ended up frustrated with the whole process of waiting.Often cited as a prototype of Basic Instinct, this can easily work on its own levels. Sure there are similarities ie is there murder involved? What is the lead character hiding? Bisexuality etc. but it's a different movie with a different feel to it.The story starts out that Gerard Reve is a bisexual author who believes his stories " lie the truth." It is an interesting statement at a lecture he gives but what I found more interesting was that after stating he was a Catholic and goes on to say that " science is Catholic." Given that anyone I know who is deeply religious is against the very notion of science because " they are trying to play God." I'm not one bit religious but it provides a thought provoking question in " Is science an extension of Christianity." Believe it or not I spent half the night thinking over that one over since it had stuck in my head.The great thing about Verhoeven's pre-Hollywood movies is their ability to insert glorious visual treats. The visions that Gerard gets at times are distinctly creepy. While on a train he notices a picture of a hotel and is transported there while daydreaming. He goes to the door and is about to open the door when he sees an eye pop out of the door and ooze it's way down leaving a bloody smear across the door. Some may see shades of Bunuel and Dali in that shot alone.Ingmar Bergman, a director Paul Verhoeven frequently cites as an influence, also shows. The opening image of a spider preying on a fly as it's victim is also startling in it's detail. How it creeps around and wraps the fly around in it's web so it can't move. As I say it's fascinating in it's detail.Gerard falls for Christine, a hairdresser left a fortune from her dead husband. But is she hiding a secret from Gerard. The plot slowly unravels as does Gerard's sanity while his mind is giving him clues as to what might be the truth ( or a lie of the truth as it were ). Whether Christine is what Gerard thinks she is is up to you.If I were to compare this to Basic Instinct ( which is inevitable really ), I would have to say that this lays more intrigue on the viewer and in a certain way is like the spider laying a web whereas Basic Instinct is a lot more blunt and obvious. Apart from some homoeroticism which borders on blasphemy if you are particularly religious in The Fourth Man, Basic Instinct has lesbianism which is a lot more palatable for Americans. There are calls of misogyny and it is true there are instances in The Fourth Man where that occurs but it is not as crude as Basic Instinct. In contrast to Basic Instinct, yes there are similarities but this feels like a completely different movie and has a different feel to it as well. While The Fourth Man is an atmospheric chiller that grips the viewer, Basic Instinct, despite the plot that revolves around it, feels a bit like a soft porn parody. However that is only my view of things. All in all this movie should be seen by those who like a sense of adventure in their movies.

This album actually does hit an emotional chord in you. Some may go all soft and gooey with sentimentality and feel quite amorous - others may have the overwhelming urge to kill. Sadly I get feeling number 2 when I listen to this. This CD is like a bad rash for me. It's deeply irritating and it gets under your skin. Whenever I tried putting this CD on I immediately regret it and put on another one. Now I don't know what degree of sentimentality some other listeners get. I know of a friend who cried when heard this because he loved it so much - I bought this album on his recommendation and it was cheap after all but I just couldn't call this a masterpiece. There's just no struggle, no rage, no power and very little variation in emotion if there's any variation at all. It just seems that there is too much of an acceptance going on in this album. Halfway through God Is In The House I felt like saying " yeah and I'm leaving "You may not agree with me and I have no option but to accept that ( haha ) but just my thoughts on this album

This is the sort of album that should be made more often. The guitars have resonance and power and sound like they know what they're doing. Added to Nick Cave's voice and the effect is wonderful. Admittedly they might suffocate the vocals somewhat but given Cave's lyrical work, it almost seems appropriate. The CD is a little short however ( just clocking in at a half an hour ).The DVD is amazing - I've probably played this more times than the CD itself. OK it's about 17 minutes long but what you get pure controlled chaos. The band don't talk to the audience or even themselves apart from Thomas Wydler once shouting " eins, zwei, drei, vier " but the musicianship is wonderful.Of course this is going to be bought as an look as to see how The Bad Seeds came about. But it easily stands alone by itself. Recommended regardless of the history behind it

I myself have yet to get them but I probably will. I tried reading this book a few times but each time I do, it comes across as being terribly smug and there are a lot of things that just don't work on print. Some other reviewer claimed that this was Monty Python humour and he's right but the thing with Monty Python is that it is visual humour and some visual humour just doesn't work in print. Monty Python only works if your watching TV. I have seen the Hitchhiker series on TV and the things that don't work well in print work much more effectively on screen. The thing needs a visual dimension which the book doesn't give it. It doesn't matter how cheap it is - it has more of an impact on the viewer but of course there are always those who disagree - the book club especially but what can you do. Also what works well as a narrative for a radio show and TV sitcom comes across as being a bit of a distraction. What I did find interesting with the book is what made him begin the idea for the Hitchhiker's Guide which I actually found really amusing myself having trekked to Germany once and finding it almost incomprehensible trying to understand the German language and what the people were saying. If you read that introduction a little more closely, Adams will admit to being bored/p**sed off at writing these novels on demand. And it does show. I know the TV series was great ( cheap but great ). I'd probably watch the film given the time and I certainly would listen to tapes of the original radio show but the book is a different matter. What sounds hilarious on radio/TV comes off as being a bit contrived in print. Pity though that Adams has passed away as he did have a canny mind.

The first half hour of this film has pretty much most of the violence. And surprise surprise most ( actually all ) of the victims are young women at this stage. Another 14 year old girl is taken hostage in the killers house where it's revealed that it's a 50+ year old man who is on a revenge mission for the death of his daughter. The 14 year old girl has the unenviable position of a) looking like his dead daughter b) being tied to a bed. When he explains why he is killing these women ( most of whom are stunningly attractive ) he says because the women of today " do things which they shouldn't - they're filled with filth." Which doesn't really make sense at all for the seemingly random killings that he carried out. OK the last one may have some suggestion as to why he did it but you'd still be hard pressed to think of that as a motif because it just doesn't add up. The rest of the film laboriously plods on as we try out the detective whodunnit done by 19 year old guys who're suspicious. If you felt uncomfortable in your seat thinking " Come on damn it end for Chrissakes," you would not be alone. It's tedious and well the movie just begs to be finished off quicker. In the ending it certainly springs a surprise or two. Very effective I might add to. One guy dousing his friend and the entire garage with petrol and setting the garage on fire after his friend finds out the truth about the who is the killer. After that it kinda gets really creepy which I'll let you watch without spoiling it. Needless to say it is a pretty good ending. By the way I wouldn't believe that true story nonsense or at least if it is true the director made a complete hash of the whole thing.However in spite of all that, I still rate it two stars because it is deeply misogynistic, the middle part of the film is horrendously slow to the point of crashing to a halt and the whole film does not strike me as believable. The film is riddled with nonsense which doesn't add up. A shame really, it had all the ingredients for a good movie but you can never trust descriptions fully.

.....die hard fanatics - I think this is a great album and it's only the first album I bought. I think the music is great and there's not much to complain about no matter how " primitive " the equipment is. Granted, I can understand why cEvin might think that some fans might not like it but I think he shouldn't worry about it. What I say to you is buy the album if you enjoy then that's OK, if not then seek out something else

The last album by KUKL is an absolute revelation to listen to. From start to finish, the band possess this manic, crazed energy that is simultaneously a joy to listen to and rather suffocating at the same time. It is the sound going along with a certain idea and then gleefully ripping it apart within minutes. You get the feeling of something of demented carnival music from track 2 onwards. The sort of feeling that you should always look over your shoulder for fear of what might happen next.Unfortunately there would be no more KUKL releases though Bjork and Einar Orn would move onto more commercial success with The Sugarcubes and later their own respective solo work. But this album more than anything captures youthful enthusiasm at it's most demented and captivating. An album where bouncing off the walls is essential.

The Shamen hit their peak in 1992 with Boss Drum with the British No.1 Ebeneezer Goode. Ever since then they deliberately stayed away from the charts and had been ridiculed by some of the music press. Well naturally this sort of happens.Either way this greatest hits collection collects most of the material that they did while on One Little Indian so it rather convenient that they left off some of the brilliant singles from pre-OLI days or even the last album they made. But this is understandable. Particularly considering the coded message that was given on Hempton Manor, the last album The Shamen did for One Little Indian.While the early singles on this compilation bristle with enthusiasm and energy - come Axis Mutatis era singles they seem a little deflated. And the singles are definitely not a representative picture of the Axis Mutatis. While Axis Mutatis is quite spacy to the point of drifting motionlessly in space, the singles are quite flat, as if they never gained lift-off. However Indica suggested that everything was going much more smoothly.The remix collection I haven't listened to in a long time and is quite frankly something you'd have to go about carefully. The way the whole megamix works by meshing one track into and out of another can be viewed equally as brilliance and headache inducing at the same time. However, I believe that this CD has been repackaged a few times and sold off to unsuspecting customers so if you have this, you don't need another remix CD.

Richard H Kirk and DJ Parrot made this techno album at the turn of the 90s and it's very easy to see this. The synths sound gloopy and with the odd wheep too but having said that it holds up well unlike similar records from it's time which sound hopelessly dated full stop. This, although getting on a bit, still has a few ideas in the tank that could inspire a few of the new guns a thing or two about the production. One thing you could say is that it's very precise in it's production. Not polished but not quite messy if you know what I mean. An enjoyable release nevertheless that may only be appreciated by those who have a passion for techno music

Time has been cruel to The Shamen in Britain . Cruelly mocked for their number 1 single Ebeneezer Goode they've never quite recovered their status as one of Britain's best dance rock fusionists .This was made before any &quot; Eeezer goode &quot; anthems had graced the nation . And what a great album it is too ! We start off with the groovy You Me And Everything ( Else ). We are lead into a track were we here pilots giving orders and reporting their progress in a war torn area set behind the synths . Next song is Negation State which is a furious Will Sinnot rap over the state of politics and how they will blanket everything that's going on in day to day life . True the Scottish accent may not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it sounds goodNext up is a remix of Raptyouare cunningly title Reraptyouare . We are lead into another remix - this time of Strange Days Dream which is good as it adds to the original . Phorward is a nice little track . It sounds slightly sinister but it's worth itThe S&amp;N sessions are next on the list and you are given a rework of Happy Days with Colin Angus on vocals . Then we are given Knature Of A Girl which is equally great . In fact that track shows you how much The Shamen went through a total transmutation . It's hard to believe that from Drop we had these Echo &amp; The Bunnymen/Syd Barrett influenced psychedelic rockers to these techno hybrids making strange new music .We then are given Darkness In Zion and this is a very harsh and unsettling track which jars the nerves of most listeners . A strange end to an albumSo why four stars ? Well it feels a little too short for my liking . I have the feeling they could have put more in but I won't complain - it's a great album that everybody should listen to if they are open minded about these things . It's only a pity some people will always remember them for Ebeneezer Goode - they had much more to offer

But there's a lot here that puts the album in a wildly uneven album. And it takes a very concerted effort to listen to it the whole way through. I would probably give it 4 stars on another day but I can't lie on an album like this as it is a real patience tester. The title track is one of the most annoying songs on it. Based around a cigarette. Some may call it art, I call it an excuse for Blixa to light up a smoke for a track. But then this is one of those arty deals. Art divides as many people as it embraces so it's just a question whether they like it or not.So I'll leave it to you the listener, to form your opinion because no review here will ever really give you a great incentive to buy or listen to the album - only you can do that!

This is nearly all of Aphex Twin's remixes for cash, as the title explains so plainly. It's a good album, there's no questioning that but most of the songs are all ambient and sometimes it might get a little samey over the course of the two CDs. But there's some great remixes especially the remix of an 808 State song ( uncredited here )It's definitely worth investigating but the ambient sounds can get tiresome after a while

If you are brave enough to buy this CD, be prepared for this CD to scour your brain inside and out. It's fiendishly noisy. There was an old review I read on the internet with the band and Nick Cave had said that he was unimpressed with some of the recordings of that time because they did not capture the intensity of their live performances. After listening to this, I can see what he means. This is obnoxiously ferocious. The sort of take-no-prisoners live album that shreds it's instruments for an all-out aural assault. Some of the songs are virtually unrecognizable from their studio counterparts. While I've never gone to a Birthday Party concert, this CD would pretty much give me a clear indication about how it would be like. You could probably end up empty headed, sore and in desperate need of paraceteamol to cure that thumping headache. If you are brave enough to listen to this, make sure you have aspirin at the ready....because your headache could get nasty!
