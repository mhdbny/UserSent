Having watched this with my child & company at the theater (and then at least 10 times at home), I can't escape putting a review here. All of the familiar slapstick absurdities of Spongebob are here. The joys of Bikini Bottom (yes, that's the name of the town!) are present as well. Mr. Krab's Krusty Krab fast-food joint (where Spongebob works as fry cook), Spongebob's bosom best buddy Patrick Star (as in starfish, 'though I've yet to see a pink one in nature), the square, schadenfreude-laden Squidward (cashier at the Krusty Krab).Others have mentioned it and I can't deny--it's difficult to take a 30 minute show broken down into two segments and weave a cohesive plot over an hour. This film manages to make fair go of it, keeping the laughs flowing with new material, situations and an actual (*gasp*) plot. There are new characters, especially the pride-filled King Neptune and his thoughtful daughter Mindy...but then again, Spongebob afficianados will remember the phrase uttered by Spongebob on many an occasion, "By Neptune's Crown!". This movie gives some life to that phrase, as the plot revolves around a dastardly plot by Plankton to steal Neptune's crown and Rule The Undersea! He's apparently moved on from coveting merely the Krabby Patty secret sauce by now.Positive messages about teamwork, friendship, not giving up, setting goals and then achieving them. Not too scary for the wee-wee ones--even scary put-ons end with a chuckle. Two thumbs up for me, this is a funny family film grown-ups with a quirky sense of humor will enjoy watching with their little ones. At least the first 11 times!

I truely enjoyed reading Kazantzakis' "Zorba the Greek".Our reserved Narrator (I don't recall the author ever naming him, so I'm using the capitol "N"--Zorba simply calles him "boss") meets the lanky Alexis Zorba in a Piraeus cafe, and being charmed by his wit, spirit, and the honesty of his emotion, hires him on as his foreman in a coal mining venture. The fact that Zorba can play the santuri and knows stories and songs for the journey doesn't hurt, either!On Crete, we meet the inhabitants of a traditional village, from the cafe proprieter and patrons to the aged yet still attractive matron of the local "house of ill-repute". The characters are uniquely portrayed, the scenery vivid. I almost felt I was standing among them as I read. There is no hiding of emotion here, whether jelousy, fear, or exhuberant joy.Zorba rejected self-denial long ago, and of all the characters here, seems to be the most accepting and least judgemental of any. He takes joy in becoming the lover of Dame Hortense, a retired prostitute of respectible years. He is protective of the miners he supervises, and sets a good example. And when a jealous mob of villagers gathers to run down and murder the defenseless village Widow, it is Zorba alone who stand up for her. For all his flippant and off-handed comments about women, the truth is that Alexis Zorba recognizes women's needs as he recognizes his own, and treats the women he has known--and those he hasn't--with respect. Zorba is mischevious but true, comforting and counseling a mad monk who has dreamed of turning his Hypocritical monastary into an inferno as a cleansing act. There are so many things happening here!Zorba has thrown off the manufactured constraints of society and bends to them only when he wishes to. He is true to his heart, and a true friend and brother to the Narrator. Through observing and experiencing Zorba, the Narrator learns to experience life, not just watch it from the outside. He abandons the Buddhist wheel of self-denial under which he had pinned himself. These men remain brothers of sorts, in the end separated by miles and borders, but not by heart and spirit. One of my favorite passages, spoken by Zorba after the Narrator asks him about being accountable to God for his life reads thus:" 'God enjoys himself, kills, commits injustice, makes love, works, likes impossible things, just the same as I do. He eats when he pleases; takes the woman he chooses. If you see a lovely woman going by, as fresh as clear water, your heart leaps at the sight. Suddenly the ground opens and she disappears. Where does she go? If she's a good woman, they say: 'The devil's carried her off.' But, boss, I've said so before and I say it again, God and the devil are one and the same thing!' " (page 263)I came to re-appreciate the simple joys of everyday life in reading this book. Zorba is an active participant in life, not simply as our Narrator seems to be at the beginning, a passive observer. If you enjoy living literature, I would strongly recommend this book to you.

Old-school economic Conservative Kevin Phillips confronts some of the most vexing issues facing the United States today. Pulling no punches in this enthralling volume, Phillips blasts some of the most dangerous wings of the right today, namely madcap religious fundamentalists and big spending pet-project-earmark-pushing Republicans who no longer have Democrats to hide behind now that they're in control of the National Senate, House, and White House. While not a perfect academic work as far as citing sources, the author forcefully debates real issues which threaten to have long-term effects on us and our children.As a non-partisan without party affiliation, I appreciate Phillips stand and introspection concerning his own party's beliefs and actions. It takes a lot of courage to examine those in power. Our leaders have shown they need constant supervision and shouldn't have a free pass to do whatever they please. Conservative, liberal, or otherwise, they work for and represent us--We The People! So Phillips willingness to step up and provoke the wrath of the mealymouthed yes-men now weilding control over so much (media, gas, taxes) is welcome.We should worry about issues concerning our constitutional rights, and we most certainly should be concerned about the absurd build-up of debt, loss of jobs in the American Manufacturing sector, and the insidious spread of blind irreason in our society. Looking at the madness of theocratic regimes such as Iran should have kept our vision straight and sober. It is time for people to act and express their discontent with the present embarassing incompetence in government. Bravo, Mr. Phillips.

Radha Rajagopal Sloss's unique book is something of an unofficial biography of 20th century philosopher J. Krishnamurti and the events surrounding his career as a religious/philosophical teacher. The daughter of Rosalind Williams Rajagopal and husband D. Rajagopal, Radha Rajagopal Sloss's book is not a sordid expose, it is not graphic or insulting. It is simply a sincere account of her very real experiences growing up in amazing circumstances among amazing people. There is a lot of information here which isn't included in &quot;official&quot; biographies of philosopher J. Krishnamurti, which helps the reader get a better idea of the politics and humanness which even great men may be affected by. Author Sloss in fact, mentioned this tendancy of official biographies to ignore or excuse certain parts of Krishnamurti's life as a reason for penning this work.Some of the controversy this book generated is due to the fact that certain students and followers of Krishnamurti believe that he was a living example of a perfect human. This volume disspells that myth, indeed, he looks quite human throughout this writing. It was interesting to find how Krishnamurti dealt with some of his biggest stressors, including financial disagreements with friend D. Rajagopal, and the pregnancy (by him) of his dear lover Rosalind Williams Rajagopal. Radha describes her love of &quot;Krinsh&quot; (Krishnamurti), who was like a second father to her, and how his increasing unwillingness to deal with problems damaged many relationships and people. Included are numerous letters to and from Krishnamurti, D. Rajagopal and Rosaling Rajagopal, and numerous other individuals who were active on the Theosophical movement or Krishnamurti's teachings. A very worthwhile read for anyone with an interest in history, philosophy, or the full history of J. Krishnamurti.

He-Young Kimm wrote this book while still a member of the World Kuk Sool Won Association in 1985. With his expertise in Kuk Sool, Hapkido, and Tae Kwon Do, he was certainly the right person to present the first book no this style not completed under the direct supervision of the WKSWF. Kimm succeeded in offering a lavish and educational volume on this inclusive modern Korean Martial Art. With the exception of Hyung (forms), Kimm completely demonstrates all required sequences of techniques up to the rank of Fourth Dan Black Belt Rank in the art of Kuk Sool Won (which translates roughly into National--meaning Korean--Skills School).At 760 pages, Kimm is able to include not only the sequential series of photographs detailing technique, but also a number of artistic photos which should serve the heart of any martial artist. The first 139 pages cover the introduction to the art--history, philosophy, stances, striking points, basic techniques, etc. Each Part is broken down into the required grouping of techniques. In Kuk Sool Won, Techniques are taught in groupings--for instance, you would learn a series of 15 basic techniques with a partner, then 11 defenses against wrist grabs as a group.In addition to and after the basic techniques are learned (how to strike, kick, etc), for the first keub (Kyu in Japanese, or junior belt) ranks in Kuk Sool, one must master 7 series of techniques. This includes 15 Ki Bon Sul (basic techniques), 11 Son Mok Soo (Defense Against Wrist Grab), 13 Eui Bok Soo (Defense Against Cloth Seize), 6 An Son Mok Soo (Defense Against opposite Wrist Seize), 15 Maik Chi Ki (counter strikes to vital points), 15 Maik Chak ki (Counter KICKS to vital points), and Cho Keub Hyung (beginner's form--not shown). All of the sequential techniques to 4th dan black belt are included, and should be of interest to anyone with a background in Kuk Sool, Hapkido, Jujutsu, or a Tang Soo Do/Tae Kwon Do style which includes any sort of grappling in their Ho Sin Sul (self defense) requirements.Every series of technique is completely illustrated and described. While I could fault Kimm for not delving deeper into history, he does remedy this in his subsequent books Hapkido and especially Hapkido II. If you can only afford one book by Dr. Kimm, I would Recommend Hapkido II--If you practice Kuk Sool Won or a Ki Do art in the lineage of In-suk Seo, this book might be more specific.With Kimm's background in martial art, and the apparent good terms he is on with fellow instructors in the USA, Korea, and otherwise Internationally, I eagerly await his future Publications--especially concerning History of Korean Martial Arts. If you have had difficulty finding Dr. Kimm's books, you'll be pleased to know that often Kimm's publications may be obtained by contacting the World Han Mu Do Association.

Written in 1966, this is Tohei Sensei's third book after "Aikido: The Arts of Self Defense" (1960) and "What is Aikido?" (1962). At that time, Koichi Tohei was the Chief Instructor of the Aikikai. Later on because of politics or personal growth, depending on the source, Tohei formed his own organization, and for a while stopped using the term Aikido in favor of the term "Ki" (same as Chinese "Chi").Although there are some exercises described, this is more of a philosophical book which delves deeply into the spirit and theory behind the art and practice of Aikido. This is the first developed thesis on Tohei's Ki concepts, which are generally free from the superstitions and magical thinking that permeates some other schools of thought. "KI" according to Tohei has more to to with the unity of the mind with the body.Later revised editions of this volume were published as "Ki in Daily Life". I like the harmony of a unified Aikido presented in this earlier version.

Glenn Morris picks up where he left off in his first book, "Path Notes of an American Ninja Master" (1993). This is not an instructional book on ninjutsu per se (no pictures), although it is chok-full of Morris's further journey on the martial arts /ninpo path (Bujinkan style under Masaaki Hatsumi), anecdotes and interpretations of philosophy, both Asian, Occidental, and other. I found it similar in some ways to Robert Smith's book, "Martial Musings". Some of Glenn Morris's most interesting views he presents in Chapter 9, "Characteristics of Shugyosha Across Cultures" (page 169). Shugyosha he defines as a person who is searching for the truth...I have a feeling that this is what Morris is doing with his series of books.There is also the enjoyably opinionated Chapter 11, "Mud and Water, Purity and Power" where Morris allows his biases against other well known (sometimes questionable) martial artists of our time, to hang out in the wind. Among them Harunaka Hoshino (originally known as Chi Yuan) who created his own ninpo art from Japanese karate and kobudo during the ninja boom, Choi Hong-hi of Taekwon-Do whom he lambasts as having earned only shodan (1st black belt) before his return to Korea from Japan (now, now--nobody promoted Hatsumi sensei to 15th dan), and Genbukan Ninpo's Shoto Tanemora, once a student of Ninja Great Masaaki Hatsumi (and others) whom he dismisses as "...another cop..." with robotic movements (page 244). Some of the criticisms are fair, some are not...Morris doesn't bother to share his sources.I don't accept Glenn Morris's interpretations and claims concerning the many things supernatural/psychic which pepper his writings--but if I only read things I agreed with, I wouldn't be living! I am, I admit, a cautious skeptic. I find Morris to be overly generous in the way he doles out his faith, often optimistic in accepting theories and studies which have not been scientifically counducted or checked, although even he draws the line at things like Alien abductions (see Chapter 13, pages 312-316). On the other hand, his insights are honest, and personal. In sharing his beliefs, he hides nothing, holds back nothing. Reading between the (esoteric) lines without any adaptation or interpretation, I find much of the advice he offers on this volume to be homespun, and often sensible.Morris seems a cross between a scholar-warrior and a pseudo-intellectual hippy. This book is entertaining and fun to read. You don't have to share the man's opinions or beliefs to enjoy his adventures. If you enjoy martial arts autobiographies, or reading the personal thoughts of other people, this volume is just the thing.

This is not, thankfully, another generic book on &quot;chi practice&quot;. Author Wen Mei Yu Introduces us to and instructs us in a very specific form of Chi Kung: Wild Goose Chi Kung. Yu was a student of Madam Yan Mei Jun, the legendary grandmaster of this popular and complex school of energy cultivation.Every necessary topic is covered in this volume, including history (photos of Grandmaster Yan Mei Jun are included), philosophy (this is a Taoist school), Theory (very detailed, many diagrams with explanations), and of course the COMPLETE 64 movement Wild Goose form.A note on the instructional photographs in this volume: every technique is illustrated by several photographs. The pictures do an excellent job of communicating direction, movement, posture, et cetera. Yu also takes the time with more complex techniques to show common mistakes practitioners should avoid. This is probably one of the best books on physical chi practice out there. I found it to be thorough but not cluttered. Every piece of information fit, and the author's descriptions and explanations were easlily understood in the context of traditional belief and practice.

This volume goes far beyond the usual regurgitations we hear in the martial arts world. Author John J. Donohue takes what is perhaps the deepest look yet in print at how and why our society understands and perceives martial arts as it does. I will relate a few concepts here from each of the eight chapters of the book. The author's thoroughness and inclusiveness have made it impossible to touch on all of the topics which he connects connects in each chapter. The majority of the author's practical Martial arts studies have been in Japanese arts, so Japanese terminology is used in most circumstances (definitions offered, glossary in back too). This should not be construed as a bias _against_ non-Japanese arts, but instead as the author admission of the limitations of his own experience. It does not in my opinion, impact the ideas he imparts, which go beyond where an art may have originated and probe concepts most combative arts possess. Donohue manages to put concepts that we've known existed into words--and he does so skillfully.In chapter 1, "A Warrior Dream", Donohue considers mysticism in the martial arts, writing, "An overly mystical approach to the martial arts is usually symptomatic of a lack of familiarity with them on the part of Western observers. (11)" He links the quest for self-definition to a sense of accomplishment through acquiring skill, and the exploration of the mystic. The second chapter, "Form and Function: Martial Systems in Cross-Cultural Perspective", Donohue examines combative and martial practices in cultural perspective. He takes for his examples among others, the expansion of the Zulu as a result of their innovative military system, Josephus remarks on the extensive training of Roman soldiers as cause for their success, and the tendancy to teach soldiers in modern military forces basic yet efficient training, touching on how technology has lessened the dependence on hand-to-hand skills for survival on the battlefield.In the next chapter, "The Asian Martial Arts: Just So and Just-so Stories" Donohue shows that the ways in which martial arts are interpreted are the result of many factors. He offers a brief history which covers the development of martial arts in Japan and China, and then the relation between moral and mystical belief in martial arts, and prevailing religious/philosophical practices of the cultures in which they developed such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Discussed in-Depth are the notions of Ki, Haragei, and Mu-shin, etc... Chapter four "Martial skills, Marginality, and Moral Force: Mythic Dimensions in the image of the American Warrior" seeks to explain why martial arts are so popular with Americans, and how they fit into the myth of the rugged individual as competent fighter. He shows that most films which cater to this genera contain similar elements meant to suggest to the viewer the independence of their main characters. An interesting chart compares "Shane" with "Lethal Weapon" and "Above the Law"."Training, Adaptation, and Elaboration: The American Dojo" is the fifth chapter, and deals with heirarchy, organization, rank, and structure...and the lack of those things in some cases. Chapter six, "Mystery and Mastery: The Added Dimension in the Martial Arts" concerns itself with the reliance on mystical and quasi-magical explanations of qualities such as Ki by many American martial artists, and how many prefer Asian combatives because they possess this dimension. Chapter Seven, "The Search for a Center" tackles the idea of conforming to the norms of the martial arts group in dress, behavior, and practice. The last Chapter, "Wave People", covers the diversity of meaning that can be found in the symbols of martial arts.The insights offered by John Donohue in this book put my practice in a new perspective. There are different ways of seeing and experiencing martial arts that go beyond variations of style or nationalistic flavor. For a deeper understanding of what we're doing and why we're doing it, give this book a try.

By far the most exhaustive guide to the art of Shuai Jiao (Aka Shuai Chiao) in English. Prior to this volume, there was only a single other work in English on this most practical of wrestling styles (&quot;Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao&quot; by Daniel Weng, who was a student of Chang Tung-sheng's). Authors Liang Shou-yu and Tai Ngo offer a thorough history, in-depth explanation of the theory behind this form of fighting, and important body-toughening exercises. Then they demonstrate a rather complete catalog of techniques from throws and locks to holding and locking on the ground. It will probably come as no surprise to seasoned martial artists who have had the opportunity to watch a Shuai Jiao match that the main differences between this art and others is the speed at which techniques are executed upon a subject (one of the reasons Shuai Jiao body training is sooo tough!).Prior to this volume, the only exposure most of us (outside China and Taiwan) had to Shuai Jiao were a few scattered articles dealing with the great fighting master, Chang Tung-sheng, who maintained an incredible level of fitness even beyond his '70's! The one point which is neglected in this book is the importance of striking PRIOR to the execution of a Shuai Jiao technique (Chang Tung-sheng's theory). Of course, Author Liang Shou-yu is from Mainland China and not Taiwan, and may simply offer a path which deviates from Chang's known methods.This book is a vast improvement over other Shuai Chiao books (mostly Chinese language), which limit themselves to a few illustrations. The editors and authors have teamed up to make sure the photographs convey correct direction and motion. A sequel dealing with either competitive Shuai Jiao or advanced applications (striking + locking &amp; throwing) would be most welcome. What a pity this magnificent art isn't more widely known and taught outside of China.

This is Allan Rohan Crite's second book following "Were You There When They Crucified My Lord" (Harvard, 1944). Although definately not as well known as he should be due to his own good nature, dedication to his parents, and unwillingness to turn a gross profit off of his own works, Crite is an American artist of no little renown. Crite's work here is a deeply symbolic testament to his faith, and one needn't be religious to appreciate his skill. The figures are all dark in hue, although they all have a variety of different phisical/racial features. For me, this has the effect of bluring the importance of race-color in Crite's Spirituality. The lonely and the weary can be comforted, and humanity is capable of such a grand pageant.This volume includes illustrations for 3 traditional hymns. Each lavish drawing takes up an entire page, with a line from the hymn (in order) beneath it. This is a very moving work executed in ink pen and brush, Crite's illustrations are detailed in rendering a fine vision of glory. The style is reminiscent of stained glass iconography.In "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See", angels and saints guide a weary Black farmer to heaven, cloak him in glory, and usher him in to meet Jesus."Swing Low Sweet Chariot" sees a winged chariot descending on the fields of an elderly Black tenant farmer resting by a stream. Angels lift him into the chariot and bring him through the gates of heaven. The detail on the wings alone is pure magnificence!"Heaven" is the last and lengthiest of the pageants, containing numerous full-page illustrations of parades of robed angels singing, playing a diverse collection of musical instruments, walking through the firmament of heaven, culminating in the crowning of the occupants of heaven and the entrance of Jesus.Seeing and considering Crite's works are a must for every pen & brush ink artist, in my opinion. At any rate, Crite's style has most definately influenced and impacted me! I suppose you, too will have to see for yourself. :)

What I prefer about Victor Harris's translation of Musashi Miyamoto's book is the fact that Harris has gone through exacting lengths not just to present an accurate translation in the context of a 17th-century samurai, but to present Musashi in his proper historical context. As opposed to every other English translation I have read, this one includes a chapter which gives a biography of Musashi, and shows many of his creations, such as paintings (including a self-portrait), tsuba (swordguards), etc. We can see where Musashi stayed, and what his grave looks like, etc. For clarity in understanding, this volume, along with the translation by Thomas Cleary, are the best. I should justify that by explaining that I practice martial arts--for those of you looking for a business oriented edition, there are several translations and interpretations out there which are geared towards your needs. For those of you involved in the practice of martial arts, sports, or with an interest in historical strategy texts, I heartily recommend this translation!Whay does this book discuss? Musashi's masterpiece eschews practice, and decries vanity, ego, and "secrets". Musashi was a practitioner of Zen Buddhism, and the influence of Zen philosophy can be seen everywhere in his writing. This is however, definately a book on the strategy of swordsmanship, and not a treatis on religion. Musashi Miyamoto fought in a number of duels--back in the era of true challenge matches--when usually the victor was the man left living! The realities of his times, the fact that life was so cheap and had to be guarded fiercly, and that Musashi succeeded in doing this is what makes his writing even more precious. This was the book Musashi passed on to the students of his school, the unusual two-bladed Ni-to Ryu (two-sword school). For more on the historical Musashi Miyamoto, read Makoto Sugawara's excellent (non-fiction) "Lives of Master Swordsmen".

A very complete follow up to Dr. Yang's first book, &quot;Shaolin Chin Na: The Seizing Art of Kung Fu&quot;, I consider this manual to be complex enough that it will probably be best understood by peole who have studied a grappling/locking art of some sort for at least a year (Kuk Sool, Jujutsu, Shuai Jiao). Like most of Yang's other books, there is so much information here it borders on being exhaustive...and we all know that is not a bad thing!Yang explains the principles of Chin Na, and builds upon this foundation by offering strengthening exercises for joints which often bear the brunt of punishment in this type of training. His treatment of techniques is thourough. Those with the patience to read this manual and practice the locking and siezing techniques contained within will undoubtedly gain further insight to the workings of their (respective) arts. Yang also offers an important chapter (page 168) on correcting injuries sustained in practice, in addition to six special herbal formulas for martial arts training (bruise remedies, dit Da Jau, etc.) at the end of the volume (page 185).

Hsu's book dispells many myths, including the story of the Shaolin Temple being the ancient home of Chinese martial arts. He discusses many topics including teacher student relationships, the difference between "Northern" and "Southern" style kung fu, forms, two man fighting sets, and more. The great pity is that there are not more serious books of this caliber on Chinese (or other!) martial arts.This is NOT a how-to book, there are no sequences of techniques or instructions on forms. It is however, an invaluable aid to those seeking helpful factual information on Chinese martial arts, written in a straightforward and non-self-promoting way. I have bought copies of this to send to friends who are studying kung-fu in remote areas, away from the constant supervision of a teacher. It serves as a good textbook for beginning and advanced alike, doing away with superstitious information and offering a well thought, gracious and full view of the depth of Chinese martial arts. I hope Adam Hsu offers his other Chinese-language books up for translation in the near future, he is truely someone worth listening to.

Just Kidding! This book discusses the FORBIDDEN FIGHTING TECHNIQUES of the NINJA. And when you see these models performing their...techniques on paper, you too will be ~privileged~ to know why certain fighting techniques have been relegated to the realm of the FORBIDDEN. Namely in this case, because the techniques simply cannot work and will either cause you to injure yourself, or some hapless bystander.One would be better advised to don cardboard armor and Nerf(TM) weapons than to heed the sallow call of this slender volume. Yes, I know playing ninja Ashida Kim style can be fun. You get to dress up in a black karate outfit and put on a black knit ski-mask and go traipsing about in broad daylight being...inconspicuous and all. Gets a wee bit hot in the summer though under all of that heat-absorbing black polyester fabric and the wool ski mask and such...however let me assure you that it's all fun and games until you waltz into the local 7-Eleven or Kwikee-Mart thinking "Gatorade", and the cashier takes one look at you in all your ninja stealth-finery and thinks "robbery" and pulls out ol' bessie. Not even the great Sho Kosugi has the ninja prowess to fend off the Ancient Powers of the Mystical shotgun.That aside, Ashida Kim books are great gag gifts for real martial artists! :)

I spent a month reading Adams' tale of a Rabbit Warren's growth and struggle to survive to my six-year-old. I was amazed at how into the characters she got--she was reading along with me at several points, and trying to get ahead. Although this novel deals with the rabbit in a realistic natural setting with all of their natural adversaries (foxes, mankind, other rabbits), she was not disturbed, understanding the book was a story.Adams creates an entire rabbit culture, making this tale not just a story, but an involved epic. I was impressed by Adams treatment of the characters, their unique individual traits, how they solved their problems. Each of the rabbits has something disctinctive, either a talent or an admireable characteristic which proves its use to the growing warren. This story builds on the bonds of community and friendship, and shows how intelligence, quick-thinking and effort can triumph over brutality and totalitarianism, and how team work can save the day. Woven throughout are stories the rabbits share with one another about the exploits of the legendary rabbit-prince El-Ahrairah.A well-constructed plot, if you enjoy intreague and adventure, this book will not let you down. Perfect for evening reading with the wee-ones, if you make it a nightly habit. Oh, and the two bunnies that mow our lawn at night are now nicknamed Hazel and Fiver :)

Think again! But for the pioneering spirit of Shigeru Egami...Egami pioneered certain flexability and strength exercises that are demonstrated in this book. Included are several kicking exercises which are similar or identical to many done by Korean and Chinese stylists, like the jump split kick, jump double front kick (both feet out at the same time), and so on. Also many jumping and flexing exercises. If you are familiar with the martial art of Shintaido, founded by Horoyuki Aoki, you will note many similarities, for Aoki, a disciple of Egami's, encorporated many of Egami's flexibility training ideas and techniques directly into Shintaido, making them the foundation of the art and doing away with much of the ridgidity that had taken over Shotokan since Funakoshi. Egami was an accomplished karate man, unafraid to innovate, experiment, and include new helpful training methods. Advanced &quot;hard&quot; stylists should enjoy this book, especially Shotokan, Wado-ryu, Sh'to-ryu, Kyokushinkai. Egami is seen in some circles as the &quot;Tohei of Shotokan&quot;, innovating and changing karate in a manner similar to the way Koichi Tohei changed Aikido.

To understand why this book is such a good deal, I should first explain a bit about Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan publications in general. There are a plethora of nice, costly Tang Soo Do/Soo Bahk Do/Moo Duk Kwan manuals available today. Virtually all of these fancy hardcover tomes range from 50.00 to upwards of 100.00, and don't contain much more than general information on the basics as originally presented in Grandmaster Hwang Kee's 1978 English translation of the "Soo Bak Do Dae Gam" (Korean), "Tang Soo Do: Moo Duk Kwan" (More recent reprints use the title "Soo Bahk Do: Moo Duk Kwan", and are available from the U.S. Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation for around 90.00).For those of the Moo Duk Kwan lineage (founded by Hwang, Kee), there is also the question of whose book to buy! After all, Jae Chul-shin, C.S. Kim, Ho Sin Pak, Richard Byrne, and several others all have put out costly hardcover volumes. Rest assured, they all have the same basic Tang Soo Do information...the only MAJOR difference you will find between all of these expensive volumes is who is pictured doing the techniques, and the name of the organization they now head. While it is nice to have GM Hwang's books if only for their historical value (especially since GM Hwang's untimely passing in July of 2002), the volume "Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art" tops them all by offering the same information for a much lower price (16.95). Author Kang Uk-lee was dan #70 (1952) under Grandmaster Hwang, and like all of the other authors named above, broke away from Hwang to form his own association. Well...I suppose everyone leaves home sometime. Kang's book includes crisp photos, and helpful descriptions as well as foot diagrams. There isn't a lot of space devoted to the basic techniques themselves (such as variations on hand techniques, kicking, etc), which I assume is due to the fact that most readers already will have some instruction in basic techniques. The main focus of this volume then, is HYUNG (forms). ALL of the basic forms of Tang Soo Do are covered here, to about 4th dan. Included are 19 Hyung: Ki Cho Hyung 1-3, Pyung Ahn Hyung 1-5, Chil Sung Hyung 1-3 (these are three of the new forms introduced by GM Hwang), Bassai Hyung, Naihanchin 1-3, Ship Soo Hyung, Jin Do Hyung, Kong San Kong, and Rohai. All include complete photo sequences showing ALL of the movements, as well as descriptions and foot/stance diagrams.This volume is up-to-date enough to include GM Hwang's 3 Chil Sung Hyung, but does not include other highly advanced elements like the older Japanese/Chung Do Kwan lineage forms Sei Shan Hyung, Wang Shu Hyung, Ji On Hyung, and Oh Sip Sa Bo Hyung, and also those created by Hwang, like the 3 Yuk Ro Hyung (very linear), and the master form inspired by the Mu Ye Do Bo Tong Ji, Hwa Sun Hyung. Most readers simply wouldn't need these other forms yet (unless of course you are 4th dan +). All of this advanced information is available in Hwang's second volume, "Tang Soo Do Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Volume 2" (available from the US Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation for about 60.00). Kang's book however is simply the best deal out there. All of the necessary Hyung information to take you from 10th gup to 4th dan is for the first time available to virtually anybody for less than twenty clams. Page 14-15 also includes the most complete TSD/MSK genealogy yet published, and there are some good photos showing historical items, GM Kang, GM Hwang, and other TSD folks. If you are studying Tang Soo Do or any Moo Duk Kwan derivative which utilizes the old style forms, and are looking for a guide to assist you with your technical studies, there is no better value than this particular volume. There is simply no comparison.

This volume is to throws as the volume &quot;Practical Chin Na&quot; is to joint locking. Finally we have books which explain exactly how and why the techniques we have been using for years work. Tim Cartmell gives us a complete guide to throwing, explaining and grouping techniques by the principles under which they are executed. Cartmell's roots are, interestingly enough, in Jimmy Woo's ever practical San Soo Kung Fu, although later Cartmell moved to Taiwan and then China and trained there with a number of extraordinarily skilled teachers, including Hsu Hong Chi and Hsu Chen Wang (Hsing Yi), Chen Tso Chen (Hsu Hsi Tao), Lin Ah Lung (Tang and Chen Taiji), Kao Liu-te (Yi Chuan), Hsu Fu-chin (Chen Taiji), Luo Te-hsiu (Kao-style Pa Kua Chang &amp; Chen Pan-ling Taiji), Sun Jian-yun (daughter of the famed Sun Lu-tang &amp; present headmaster).Author Tim Cartmell begins by describing types of throws (arc, circle, and spiral) and the basic principles which guide their application. Next, he explains principled of body use, and then the bulk of the book, comprised of an analysis and application of each throw. Cartmell is extremely thourough in his description of each stage of the technique, describing every little facet of motion, how to balance, how to turn, what you will feel and what is happening to your partner. Each technique offers an analysis of entry, analysis of the technique, of body use, of practical application, of counters and combat use, and variations on the throw. While there are plenty of illustrations, you will need to be a patient reader to glean the most from this volume. It is with words that Cartmell makes the whole picture come together. Whatever your discipline (Chinese style or not), if your art includes throwing techniques, this is the volume to explain the how and why's.

Truely an imaginative tragi-comedy. This is a film that will go around your expectations and show you something completely unique (I've avoided at all cost saying something "completely different"). Enter a world where you have to fill out a form to get a form to fill out...in triplicate. Big government where the left hand doesn't know the right hand exists...San Lowry is a bureaucrat-drone with a tiny automated apartment, a distant mother who enjoys recreational plastic surgery and a never-ending flow of paper to push around the desk he shares --through a wall--with another bureaucrat. You have to see it to believe it. Sam adds some exitement to his humdrum life by imagining fantastic light-infused scenes starring a winged hero--perhaps human potential, his own evaporating opportunities as he ages, or...perhaps someone he has met.While going through the efforts to correct a simple mistake which apparently cost a meek family man his life, Sam rubs elbows with a skillful cultural terrorist who delights in sticking it to the system. It doesn't take long for Sam to become mixed up in events he's really not too sure about. Throughout he seems an average guy who can't really figure out whether he's here or there, and through attempting to make right for his bureaucracy, becomes a victim of it. But a least he finds love too!This is not a simple clean tale with an easy ending, you do have to think. Worth seeing for the lavish imagination scenes alone. Dry humor meets absurdity. Welcome to Sam Lowry's world.Excellent three-disk set, worth the payout I felt. Puts some flesh on Terry Gilliam's project and turns the film into a wider experience.

I bought this book at a tournament a few years ago without really looking it over first, and was surprised recently to find it offered by a supplier like Amazon. I noticed many of the same problems the last reviewer did, and although I understand that it isn't politically correct to criticize people in the martial arts, especially teachers or those calling themselves 'master', being a teacher myself, I will be honest without being rude.While some of the techniques in this volume can be applied effectively by the average person, there are many impractical ones included in this volume as well. Technique wise, I would give it two to three stars. But overall, reviewer M.C. Busman below has a valid point with asking why the huge kanji mistakes on the cover and why the claims of tournament victories and studying with masters in Japan that cannot be verified by Irving Soto. I did not find his stories about sudying with a Japanese master or winning a huge number of tournaments believable either (a la Frank Dux, almost), he just made too many mistakes and said too many things in this book which make absolutely no sense about Japanese martial arts and culture. He is wrong on many points regarding custom, how he studies and got his rank, and so on. I also noticed that there are no pictures of the man he says he learned from in Japan, or Author Soto himself in Japan. This also strikes me as very suspicious, and has planted strong seeds of doubt regarding his veracity.That having been said, I question the motives of Irving Soto as a teacher and writer. So many things claimed by Soto in this volume don't make any sense no matter how hard you squint at them with an open mind. For what I received (this book), I do feel that I greatly overspent my money. Had I taken the time to glance through this book first, rather than blindly trusting someone who told me he was a master, I probably would not have bought it.

Mark Bishop offers us a look at karate on Okinawa. Not in the usual manner, wherein an author tries to explain techinques through pictures and words, but through descriptions of his discussions with practitioners of different styles of karate and kobudo (traditional weaponry), and descriptions of the many dojo (schools) he visited. Bishop includes photos of the places he visited and the masters he met throughout the volume, and for most schools offers lineage charts showing who the major instructors of each master were, and that teacher's senior students. One emerges with a new awareness of and appreciation for the diversity of Okinawan Karate, both in practice and philosophy.The author breaks down the book into three major sections. The first of these is on styles and teachers of Karate directly related to Chinese Boxing (&quot;kung fu&quot;), such as Jukendo, Ryuei-ryu, Goju-ryu, Uechi-ryu, Pangai Noon, and Kojo-ryu. section Two is concerned with Shorin-ryu styles of karate, including Matsumura Orthodox shorin-ryu, Ishmine-ryu, Tomari-te, Shorinji-ryu, Matsubayashi-ryu, Chuba-ryu, Isshin-ryu, Shorin-ryu (shaolin), Ryukyu Shorin-ryu, Kobayashi Shorin-ryu, Kushin-ryu, Kenwa Mabuni Shiito-ryu, Shinpan Shiroma Shiito-ryu, Tozan-ryu, and Okinawan Kempo. The third section of this book delves into schools and instructors of Kobudo (traditional weaponry), includingHoshin-ryu, Yamani-ryu, Uhuchiku Kobudo, Ryukyu Kobudo, Matayoshi Kobudo, Motobu-ryu, and Bugeikan. Also included are appendixes with a map of Okinawa (detailed names of each region of the Island), a Kata (form) chart showing what kata each school of karate practices, a list and description of Kobudo weapons, and addresses of major teachers and schools in Okinawa. This is probably the best guide to different forms of Okinawan martial arts, since the author is able to include his personal observations, and not simply a collection of data from other sources.

I find it interesting that Teri Tom had no martial arts experience at all when she found Ted Wong and began to study Jeet Kune do. Teri Tom isn't what the masses have been trained to expect in a martial arts teacher--neither are her methods. That may be why I bought this book. She teaches what ~is~ concerning this important combative building block, what works. That being said, the practical means and methods contained within Tom's book are the foundation of Boxing, kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do, numerous systems of Chinese and Okinawan Karate (Kyokushinkai if we're talking actual competitive combat), and a number of other practical street oriented schools.The Straight Lead. Fundamental element within virtually every school of boxing in the world, regardless of culture. This is a very technical treatis on a foundation technique contained in virtually every form of fistic art known to man. Within this volume you'll discover a history of fighters (generally Western boxers) who were known for controlling matches by their application of the straight lead, as well as the connection between the straight lead and fencing, how Bruce Lee became enamored of this technique and came to include it in the core of his jeet kune do curriculum, and more.The explanation of stances and footwork going beyond the usual (yawn) basic fare. You don't have to ask why, Teri Tom explains the physics of the technique and how variations in stance, balance, and body shifting can influence the application of the straight lead. Also included are drills for speed and timing, bag work, combining with other techniques. I like the fact that there are plenty of photographs to clearly get the concepts across, while the writen descriptions leave no room for doubts. The whole work flows well and is put together in a logical and understandable way. You most certainly do not have to be a Jeet Kune Do afficianado to understand this book. I believe it will be of assistance to any person with a mind for understanding mechanics or the technical side of martial arts practice.

A funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime Czechoslovakia. I enjoyed watching this movie, it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil. This is Czechoslovakia during World War II. The Nazis are officially in control, and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation. Our protagonist is young Milos Hrma, whose father is a retired railwayman, and spends the day sitting at home, looking at his watch, and telling everyone where each train is now. He encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot.Easily the youngest employee at the depot, Milos wants to fit in, be admired, be a man. He wears the uniform of a train dispatcher, but doesn't seem comfortable in it yet. While other reviewers have mentioned young Milos' talk of wanting to have sex, which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty, much can be lost in our descriptions. This is a comedy, not a prurient display. It seems that sex is simply the path Milos believes he must take to be a man. It is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot. This self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him--danger, enemy invaders, etc. If this offends you, avoid it. If you can take a little humanity here and there, I think you will enjoy this film. In the end, young railway dispatcher Milos does show himself a man...and it has little to do with s-e-x. Very worth watching!Some of the scenes are terrific--I liked the scene where Milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away from the platform and then...oh, I won't ruin it for you! Some careful thought and planning went into this film. It really is a funny movie set in a heartbreaking time. All the more interesting that it was shot in 1966. Recommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere. I wish that this sort of exitement happened on my train! :)

Translator William Scott Wilson offers us something unique with this book, first published in 1982 by Ohara. I can't recall any other source which includes this many specific writings on bushido (the warrior-gentleman's path)--there are 12 documents in this book, all written by different members of the warrior classes, dating from the 13th century (Hojo Shigetoki's "Message of Master Gokurakuji") to the 17th century (Kuroda Nagamasa's "Notes on Regulations").These writings aren't what many of us 21st century martial artists have been conditioned to expect. I found more homespun advice and common sense relative to the era these men lived in than the stereotypical talk of honor and giri (duty). Much of this advice is still sound today. An example taken from the 700+ year old "Message of Master Gokurakuji" by Hojo Shigatoki:"One should not talk about the faults of others, even as a joke. For even though one may think of it as a joke, to others it may be embarrassing, and this is a bad mistake. If one would joke, he should joke about things that are pleasurable to others. One should have restraint and deep sympathy in all things" (page 42-43)Throughout the course of Wilson's translation, it is clear to see that the Samurai (serving warriors) were a people to whom consideration of others, polite manners and conduct were important. This volume offers a nice change from the linear austerity of the "Hagakure", which for many years along with Musashi's "Book of Five Spheres" has been one of the only widely available books which set the tone for how we modern day folks think of Samurai. In "Ideals of the Samurai", not only are many of the writings centuries apart, but they are from different families and different geographical areas of Japan. If you're curious about how the "old heads" ~really~ lived and what they thought about, this work is a must.

Buck Sam Kong gives us a Step-by-step demonstration of the Tiger-Crane Set (form) accompanied by application of the form. Not much on history, etc.--this is first and foremost an exhaustive technical guide to the Hung Gar Kung Fu Tiger Crane Form. Includes transition photos which document the entire technique.This book is Kong's third, after "Sil Lum Gung Fu: Lau Gar Kuen" (privately published and not to be confused with Fung's book of similar title), and "Hung Gar Kung Fu" (also by Ohara Publications).

Despite what this title might initially suggest in the present age of Mixed Martial Arts and Submission fighting, the subject matter is actually the traditional-style defense and take down methods present in Hwarang-Do and related arts such as Hapkido and Kuk Sool. Like most schools of Hapkido-based arts, Hwarang-do is not a close-in grappling style like say, judo or competitive jiu jitsu.Sequence photographs show attacks from kicks and punches to grabs which are parried or countered with joint locks, and sumbission by throw with a continued hold on the limb of the adversary, or otherwise using leverage to bring the antagonizer to the ground where he can be held and immobilized.This volume is well-executed, I liked the presentation format. Not a bad book, easy enough to comprehend, but much of the material has already been covered in other works, including Henry Taejoon Lee's father GM. Joo Bang Lee's series of three books, "The Ancient Martial Art of Hwarang Do" (all of which I recommend). Martial artists without experience in hapkido-type arts (or other lock/throw styles) should also note that many of the techniques shown here which look spectacular in demonstrations are quite difficult to apply in practical situations without a cooperative "assailant". Still, not a bad book. I recommend this mainly for practitioners of Hwarang-Do (of course), Hapkido, and Kuk Sool.If you enjoy Korean martial arts such as Hwarang-Do or another Hapkido related style, you may also enjoy Choe's affordable Hapkido books, Kimm's "Hapkido" & "Hapkido II", Myung's "Korean Hapkido" and any of the big "Kuk Sool" textbooks. I hope someday Joo Bang Lee will be able to produce a master volume on his art of Hwarang-Do--the art certainly rates it!

This is the second book in a 4-volume instructional series published by the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation (USSBDMDKF), the official organization of Moo Duk Kwan founder Hwang Kee, now led by his son H.C. Hwang.This volume includes all of the materials required for promotion by the USSBDMDK to orange belt 6th and 7th gup. Explanations are given for hip rotation and turning through the rear properly, hand and foot techniques, and the following Hyung (forms): Ki Cho Hyung Sam Bu (#3), Pyung Ahn Cho Dan (#1), Pyung Ahn Ee Dan (#2), and the second Chil Sung Hyung (which is learned first), Chil Sung Ee Ro Hyung. The Chil Sung Hyung were created by Hwang Kee after his study of the Chinese-influenced Korean military text Mooyea Dobo Tongji. All hyung include foot/stance diagrams so that the reader can be clear about direction, stance, etc.Also presented completely are the required One Step Sparring sequences (Ill Soo Sik) #3-8, self-defense (Ho Sin Sool) same side wrist grabs #1-4 and Two-handed wrist grabs #1-3. Sparring combinations 1-5 are also included, but generally aren't part of the required USSBDMDK test. Also sections on breaking, culture and ettiquette and terminology.A high quality manual with a flexible cover hard enough to be durable, yet soft enough to be placed open on the floor without having to worry about creasing the spine of the book. Glossy laminated sweat-resistant cover keeps this book from wearing out from use.

This is the 3rd book in a continuing 4 volume series published by the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation (USSBDMDKF) presenting the official Moo Duk Kwan curriculum as passed down from Hwang Kee to hundreds of thousands of practitioners worldwide. This volume includes all of the requirements for green belt 6th, 5th and 4th gup.The terms Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do are often used interchangeably. Moo Duk Kwan is the unique name of this school, "Moo" meaning "Martial", "Duk" meaning "Virtue", and "KWan" translating as "school". The Moo Duk Kwan was founded by Hwang Kee in 1945, and although influenced in a large part by Japanese Karate, later came to include unique information derived from Hwang Kee's research into Chinese matrial arts and the Chinese-influenced Korean military manual known as the Mooyea Dobo Tongji.Included in this volume are all required hand and foot techniques, combination techniques, and the following 4 Hyung (forms): Pyung Ahn Sam Dan (#3), Pyung Ahn Sa Dan (#4), Pyung Ahn O Dan (#5), and the first Chil Sung Hyung designed by Founder Hwang Kee and based upon his research, Chil Sung Il Ro (#1), which is generally the second Chil Sung Hyung taught.Also included are one step sparring (Ill Soo Ski) #7-14, and Self-sefense (Ho Sin Sool) wrist grab on both wrists #1-4, side wrist grab Natural and alternate), and back wrist grab long & close. Sparring combinations for green belt #1-4 are also included.A highly recommended book for anyone studying the official USSBDMDK style. Helful, complete, all techniques and forms are demonstrated by Hwang Kee's son, H.C. Hwang. Quality binding allows the book to be opened all the way as a study guide without having to worry about cracking the spine. Glossy moisture resistant cover will keep this book in good condition through use.

This 4 book series is in my opinion, the most complete teaching work out there on any school of Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan. That it is put out by the official organization led by the son of the (unfortunately deceased) Moo Duk Kwan founder Hwang Kee makes it all the more reliable. This 4th volume published by the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation (USSBDMDKF) contains all of the required information for promotion to the red belt ranks 3rd, 2nd, and 1st gup, and in conjunction with the material in the previous three volumes, Cho-dan, the Midnight Blue Belt (same as black belt). This volume was also designed for use by members of other Tang Soo Do schools who would like to join the official USSBDMDK, and for that reason includes all three of the Chil Sung Hyung designed by Grandmaster Hwang Kee, which aren't as widely known as say the Ki Cho Hyung or the Pyung Ahn Hyung.Included are complete descriptions with detailed diagrams and photographs showing all required hand and foot techniques, and the hyung (forms) Pyung Ahn Oh Dan (#5), Chil Sung Il Ro (#1), Chil Sung Ee Ro (#2), Chil Sung Sam Ro (#3), Passai, and Naihanji Cho-dan.Also covered are one-step sparring (Ill Soo Sik) #13-18, self-defense for cross-wrist grabs #1-4, and same-side sleeve grips #1-4. Red belt sparring combinations #1-3 are also shown. As with the other books, a complete glossary of terminology is included, and explanations of the Moo Duk Kwan symbol, Hwang Kee's "Song of the Ship Sam Seh" (13 Influences), etc. All techniques and forms are demonstrated by the current head of the traditional Moo Duk Kwan H.C. Hwang, son of Hwang Kee.An excellent teaching mauel. Quality binding that can be opened wide for learning and won't crack the spine. Glossy sweat-resistant cover, so no worries about staining or bumped corners.

Published during the 50th anniversary of the Moo Duk Kwan school of Tang Soo Do (Soo Bahk Do) in 1995, this is a nice tribute to Grandmaster Hwang Kee and the history of the Martial Art school he founded. While this isn't the huge encyclopedia I'd hoped for, there are new photographs and new information which shed light on the formation of the Moo Duk Kwan.Hwang was one of several pioneers who taught Kong Soo Do (the Korean name for karate), later known as Tang Soo Do, in Korea beginning in the 1940's. This book describes how Hwang developed his concept of Martial Arts practice. As a youth he witnessed Taek Kyun, the korean martial art emphasizing kicking, often practiced along with wrestling at village festivals. As a young man working for the Japanese controlled Manchurian Railway company (apparently in the survey department), Hwang claims to have learned some Chinese martial arts from a teacher named Yang Kuk-jin. It is also revealed for the first time here that he learned the forms (hyung, or kata) of Japanese Karate from books in the Manchurian Railway library. Interestingly enough, Hwang's first name for his school was Hwa Soo Do, "Hwa" (flower) as in Hwarang, the legendary aristocratic youth corps of the Silla Dynasty.Photos reveal the friendship between the different Kwan (schools) back in the early days. During a school testing, Hwang includes guests of honor from the Chung Do Kwang and Chang Moo Kwan.When Korea achieved liberation from Japan after World War II, there was an effort to stamp out reminders of the Japanese oppression, including Koreanizing martial arts. Members of the Chung Do Kwan such as founder Lee Won-kuk added elements of traditional Taek Kyun, the native korean kicking art. Hwang was foremost among those who utilized libraries, studying the Moo Yea Do Bo Tong Ji, the military manual used by the Korean Nation during the Yi dynasty. Due to this learning experience, Hwang chose to replace the more popular term "Tang Soo Do" with the more traditional Korean term used for pugalistic arts, "Soo Bahk Do". Although both terms are still used interchangeably, on most official documents you will find the term "Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan".Not all-encompassing, still vague on certain points, I'd hoped for a lot more photographs of the "old days" and more about the early first generation students of G.M. Hwang. This isn't a bad work, although pricy for non-members of the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation. It is really more of a tribute to Hwang and the Moo Duk Kwan than anything else. Something is better than nothing.

This 332 page volume is the first in a projected 3-volume series. This first volume compares the philosophy of Chinese Martial arts with that of Aikido, and the empty-handed combative aspects of both arts. This volume is broken down into four sections. The first offers a historical context for both Japanese and Chinese martial arts, the second part deals with Chinese martial arts, and is heavily illustrated and includes descriptive narratives to accompany each sequence of photos. Part three deals with Aikido (specifically the Takemusu style), and illustrated by photos with explanations much the same as part two did for the Chinese arts. Part four includes direct comparisons of the most common techniques of aikido and Chinese Martial Arts.This book is heavily illustrated, and apparently intended for people who have an interest in understanding the similarities and differences--in essence, the connections between different &quot;styles&quot; of martial arts. I do not consider this book to be instructional in nature. Someone without a basis in martial arts training might have difficulty understanding the depth or point of this book--both Chinese martial arts and Aikido are rather extensive in and of themselves. The authors of this book are also NOT concerned with proving that one art is superior in any way to the other. For those with a more studious bent who enjoy considering the possibilities, here is a volume you will enjoy.A note on the co-author's relationship in research: Co-Author Tetsutaka Sugawara Studied Aikido under the arts Founder Morihei Ueshiba beginning in 1960, and has also studied Goju Ryu and Tai Chi--he is the founder of the Minato Research and Publishing Co (Now known as Sugawara Martial Arts Institute). Co-Author Lu-jian Xing studied Chinese martial arts under Chu-xinag Du, Yan-ling Xing, and others. He met Sugawara when he came to Japan in 1992 to learn Aikido as an Uechi-deshi (live in student) under Sugawara at the Sugawara Institute, and the two commenced their comparative study of these martial arts. The second volume in this series has been published, and deals with weapons aspects of both Chinese Arts and Aikido. I eagerly await the third volume in this series...

Englishman Peter Mayle and his wife realize what most of us could only dream about--life in the French countryside of Provence. Food and the hearty French life are the themes that run through this book as the Mayles undertake renovating their 200 year old farmhouse.Season by season, Mayle infuses the local folk with wit and character, introducing the eccentric Massot who it seems is forever trying to sell his house to someone, Monsieur Menicucci the local plumber who plays clarinet to keep his fingers nimble during the cold season, stonemason Pierrot who lays stone floors as well as making tombstones, and a good array of other fascinating individuals. Discover how Mayle and his wife became the proprieters of a vineyard virtually overnight (weren't things supposed to take forever in Provence, Mayle thinks???), and how to properly prepare a meal of...Fox!Throughout, food and drink are the ties which binds all together, beyond craft and culture. Or perhaps it is the ultimate craft that makes the culture. At any rate, a lovely fun book, much cheaper than a plane ticket or even renting a place in France. THIS is how to live!

A little bit of everything on this CD, from blues and a few instrumentals to humor. Many of these songs have a nice 'sing along' quality that makes this CD a take-along for those looong family drives. The quality of the recordings are decent, and the original songs are performed by the original artists. All in all, vol. 4 of this set is my personal favorite for its diversity and the fact that two of the songs just make me laugh ('I Like Trains' and 'My Baby Thinks She's a Train').

There are two groups of people who will want a book this thorough: serious practitioners of Hapkido or Hapkido bases systems (kuk sool, hwarangdo, etc.), and martial artists who are serious about studying and understanding techniques from any source. Author Mark Tedeschi has worked hard to provide a complete and non-biased book on the subject of Korean Hapkido. From the beginning, Tedeschi offers a series of interviews with the masters of Hapkido based systems, allowing each teacher to offer his knowledge in his own words, rather than lumping this information together to form a general history (he has included a section on history as well, which includes pictures of Hapkido founder Choi Yong-shul and the logos of prominent hapkido associations). We hear the voices of Choi Yong-shul (1982 interview by Jong-bae Rim, Joseph sheya, Ken Cross, and Chin-il Chang), Han-jae Ji, Bong-soo Han, Kwang-sik Myung, Tae-man Kwon, Jong-bae Rim, Merril Jung, Joo-bang Lee, In-hyuk Suh, He-young Kimm, Wally Jay, and Willy Cahill. There are detailed sections on anatomy, accupoints and meridians, pressure points, philosophy, etc. The first part of the book, which includes all of this pertinent information (this is BEFORE the section on techniques!) is 180 pages!Tedeschi doesn't skimp anywhere. Every section is complete--the technical portion of the book opens with revival techniques (most other books have this information at the end, if at all). Sections move on to stancesm rolling (for falls), attack points, hand strikes, standing kicks, knee strikes, ground kicks, kicks for blocking, jumping kicks, etc. Thoroughly covered are holds, locks, throws, strikes, combinations, etc. Tedeschi shows common and uncommon uses, and differs from the vast majority of books on Hapkido and other martial arts by offering the HOW and WHY of each technique, as well as helpful advice one would normally get from a teacher after oh say, 3-7 years and deep research on one's own. There are sections on weapons (the traditional hapkido weapons--staff, sword, short sticks, rope, cane, etc.), and a bibliography and index at the end. This is also the LONGEST book on ANY martial art that I know of, at 1136 pages. Tedeschi keeps no secrets, and puts on no airs. He is honest, humble, and to the point.I can only wonder at the effort it has taken to assemble this volume, and the drive of the author to be so complete in his assessment and documentation. Although the other big Hapkido books are nice (Suh and Seo's books on Kuk Sool, Kimm's and Myung's books on Hapkido, Joo Bang Lee's volumes on Hwarangdo), nothing, on any grappling or striking art, compares to the depth of this single volume. That this book is so affordable surprises me--books with half the information sell for more! This volume is a value and a treasure.

...Bound to annoy those who want a nice, squeeky-clean image of martial artists as saints and quiet, tea-sipping old men. Smith is highly experienced, he unlike most of those writing today, has really 'been around the block', so to speak. I certainly don't agree with all of his opinions, but that doesn't diminish the value of this book to me. I rather wish more martial artists of experience and repute would dare to publish their honest views, prejudices and all, and stimulate some honest discussion and debate in the martial arts community.The book itself is a decent hardbound affair printed on quality acid-free paper. The photos are a nice sepia tone, a cool departure from the usual stock fair. Agree with him or not, Smith's works make for interesting reading. Are you really looking to become a well-rounded, educated martial artist? This book is one you can't do without. There really is something for everyone in here.

In the introduction of his third book, Author Mark Wiley states that his purpose is not to rehash materials already presented in his previous two books (&quot;Filipino Martial Arts: Cbalas Cerrada Escrima&quot; (1994), and Filipino Martial Culture&quot; (1996)). Unlike his volume &quot;Filipino Martial Culture&quot;, the focus of this writing is on 27 different specific Filipino arts, rather than the history of the masters or organizations which propagate them.Wiley admits his work is not exhaustive, but it is (as I write) the most exhaustive guide to concern itself with he stylistic differences between different schools of Filipino arts. Wiley describes training, training methods, theory, fighting concepts and progressions, strategies, and photographic depictions of fighting techniques. You will gain as I did, a better understanding of the similarities and differences between different schools, from practice and theory to custom and tradition. The closest I have come to seeing a collection Like Wiley's is the out-of-print book, &quot;Masters of Arnis, Kali and Ecrima&quot; written by Edgar Sulite of the Bakbakan, which focused on teachers and styles of Filipino fighting. It is nice to be in the middle of the Filipino arts renaisance, and finally have the resources available to understand these practical combative methods.

This is a rare original publication with the green cover, known as the "Green Book" issued by James Yimm Lee, long deceased. Revised and expaned from the 1957 and 1958 Orange Book. Worth owning for the historical photographs alone, not to mention kung fu information from a master teacher!!!There were several printings of this volume. I have one with J.Y. Lee breaking a brick, and two others with different pictures feauturing Bodybuilder and Kung Fu fighter Al Novak smashing a brick with an open hand strike. The back cover shows Jasper Cummings, Jack Headrick, and Earl Maddox as well as another shot of Al Novak Breaking. This book offers complete instruction on how to break a brick in 100 days with absolutely no superstition and no pretentiousness. It also shows trick methods for demonstrations.According to James Lee's son Greglon Lee in the newly released "The Dragon and the Tiger...",, these books were sold in kung fu schools and martial arts shops in the Bay Area (near San Fransisco), and also by mail order.Notably absent is any hint of arrogance on the part of author James Lee. He explains things in plain and sensible language, offering personal advice and encouragement throughout. Lee's drawings and photographs illustrate the text. There are no allusions to secrets, no reference to magic! Lee comes across as the readers biggest fan as far as encouraging people to learn kung-fu. Lee also suggests students serious students take up the study body building, judo, and other styles for variety as he has! So much for the image of the "closed door" kung fu school! All of this information is right here in this little book. Is it any wonder James Yimm Lee and Bruce Lee were fast friends? I have often thought that much of Lee's philosophy of fighting came straight from James Yimm Lee, who was a welder by trade and also built many training machines for Bruce and his own students.James Yimm Lee, known as J.Y. Lee on this volume and as Kien Lee in his earlier edition of this volume (the original orange book called "Fighting arts of the Orient" which he followed with a volume co-authored with his Sil Lum or Shaolin teacher T.Y. Wong entitled "Chinese Karate Kung-Fu: Original Sil Lum System" before publishing this "green book") introduces what was technically his third published work. He later followed with a second volume to this one, as well as publishing Bruce Lee's "Philosophical Art of Chinese Gung Fu".This "green book" also has a number of historic persons and photographs throughout, including a picture and information on Kenpo Man Paul Pung, who was a student of both James Mitose and Mitose's top disciple, Thomas Young (page 101). Also Judo and jiu jitsu instructor James Moynihan of Moscow, Idaho (page102-104), kenpo great Ralph Castro who studied under William Chow and Ed Parker (page 105-108), Ed Parker on page 109, Wally Jay on page 110 and the Island Judo Club on 111-113.

These compilations of interviews are the accomplishments of Jose Fraguas, who has gone through the effort of extracting and editing many of these interviews from their original sources (often magazines inaccessible to the rest of us due to date of publication or what-have-you). What a treat to read the thoughts of Morio Higaonna (pg 97) and Teruo Hayashi of Goju Ryu, Masatoshi Nakayama (pg 225) and Turuyuki Okazaki(285) of Shotokan, Kenei Mabuni (pg 165), Kenzo Mabuni (pg 177) and Minobu Miki(235) or Shorin ryu, European Karate Pioneer Henri Plee(303), South African Shotokan Pioneer Stan Schmidt(321), and American Karate Pioneer Ray Dalke(29)! Not to mention Elite Historian Harry Cook(1) of the UK, and The USA's own William Domitrich(pg 71) of the Chito-Ryu...so many names, such little space for me to name them all! Yet what a wonderful combination from a variety of respected schools.Suffice it to say, if you are a martial arts history buff, you will have a tough time putting this volume down. You will enjoy Higaonna's truths about his sensei Anichi Miyagi as much as Ray Dalke's story of his break with Nakayama Sensei. Honest, eye-opening, and honestly, enjoyable! I often felt as if I was in the same room as these men, afforded the opportunity to learn from their experiences.A terrific opportunity at an unheard of price. My only fault with the series is that the name of the original interviewer and the publication it first appeared in is left off. A bibliography at least would have been nice. Nonetheless, who could miss the personal histories of Fumio Demora (55), Tak Kubota (153), Dan Ivan (111), Kanazawa (127) and more? Absolutely worth it!

Duk-sung Son is one of the original students of Chung Do Kwan founder Won-kuk Lee, who studied karate in Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Originally published in 1968, this is the "old school" tae kwon do Chung Do Kwan pretty much as Son learned it from Lee in Korea, prior to the changes made to the art directed at making it much different from Japanese karate and more sport oriented.The level of detail in this volume makes it worth obtaining. It was clearly written for university level students (I believe Son taught at a New York University for many years). Eschewing simple explanations and redundancy, Son presents detailed descriptions of techniques, skills, and common mistakes. Son himself posed as the model for all of the photographs, and indeed one can see from various photos his incredible physique. This text is a complete beginning through intermediate course for Chung Do Kwan Tae Kwon Do, covering all materials up to black belt level. The chapters are as follows:1. Introductory2. What is Tae Kwon Do?3. The Fundamentals of Tae Kwon Do4. Warming Up Exercises5. Basic Blows, Kicks, and Blocks6. Forms7. Three-Step Sparring8. Practical Applications9. Free-Style Fighting10. Other Exercises and Breaking11. Conclusion~IndexThe chapters "what is tae kwon do?" and those on sparring illustrate the influence of Korean culture as well as similarities to Japanese style karate. The chapter on forms (hyung) includes the two basic forms Son devised himself (Kuk Mu 1 & Kuk Mu 2), the five Pyung Ahn Hyung, Chul Gi 1 (Naihanchi Chodan), and Pal Sek (Bassai).Son offers no easy solutions, and does not cloak his advice in the mists of myth. This is martial arts for martial art's sake, devoid of salesmanship and window dressing, before the days of 4-year-old black belts, when martial artists were known as people who pushed and worked. Son tells us:"Although Tae Kwon Do does not have a philosophy per se, its philosophy, if it has onem is most closely akin to that of zen if, in fact it is not the same thing." (302)Also recommended is Son's sequel, "Black Belt Korean Karate".

Bring the sterno, pup tent, bug repellent, guitar and black ski mask, it's NINJA CAMP TIME! Written by an "anonymous individual" with a style eerily similar, nay, virtually identical to that of neo-ninja extraordinaire Radford Davis (who prefers the multicultural nom-de-plume Ashida Kim for Polotikally Korrekt reasons), THIS is a COMPLETE GUIDE to what it is like to dress up in black or camoflague and PRANCE about the woods in an effort to re-enact the deeds of the Ancient Ninja of Old Japan!!The author mixes in a lot of KUNG FU MYTHOLOGY and generic modern KENPO techniques in for kickz (cheezy pun intended), along with some materials [...], "borrowed" from Stephen K Hayes ninja books. He doesn't seem to know much about the actual history of either Japan or Ninja, BUT if you enjoy seeing GROWN MEN dressed up as ninjas and striking STEALTHY POSES in WIDE OPEN SPACES, ~this~ is the book for you!Author Radford Davis is one of the FEWER than 600 American MEN who, as teens, managed to find authentic SECRET NINJA teachers here in the United States. Apparently during the late 1970's and '80's HUNDREDS of Ninja from the Koga district of Japan flooded the United States to try out for parts in various ninja films and television programs. Hollywood being as cutthroat as it is (and was then, let me tell you!), most of these Ninja had to go out and take non-ninja jobs while waiting for calls from their AGENTS which, SADLY, never came. Imagine if you will the ninja fast-food worker, the ninja landscaper, the ninja janitor, the ninja waiter. It couldn't have been easy!Thankfully, a good number of these UNDOCUMENTED NINJA IMMIGRANTS were able to find work as SECRET TEACHERS to teenage boys, who they carefully groomed as their protegees. As with Radford Davis's Secret Teacher, they eventually disappeared when their youthful charge has mastered the elements of ninja-craft. In true ninja fashion, to date NONE of these Secret Teachers have left a TRACE, not a photograph, nore a document...no change of address on file with the post office.It's secret stuff this ninja business,I tell you! Many of the authentic Koga Ninja techniques are artfully disguised as "modern kenpo", and much of the theory presented here is surprisingly in line with that taught by Stephen K Hayes. This in and of itself screams, "AUTHENTICITY!!". It is not known what became of Radford Davis's teacher.Only 2 stars because he's EXPOSED the SECRETS of the NINJA, which will undoubtedly impact the market (again) and put a whole lot of Koga Ninja out of work and back behind the counter of venues as vaunted as the McDonald's and The Krusty Krab (move over Spongebob-O!). Who needs a secret teacher after all, when you can learn to be a ninja from a book?Happy Stealthing! ;)

A book of Ninpo Philosophy and poetry, liberally illustrated with photographs of Stephen and Rumiko Hayes, Hatsumi Masaaki, and numerous photographs in the Mikkyo Buddhist tradition and of Japanese architecture.Hayes says he has based this work on the cryptic "Makimono" (school transmission scrolls) of history. This is Hayes way of passing on the lore of ninpo to the rest of us. Well thought out, well written, and thankfully NOT cryptic or confusing. Nowadays, it is often difficult to talk about "ninja" without sounding cheesy. Hayes always manages to completely avoid all vestiges of cheesiness and pretentiousness. This is definately not some grade-schoolish effort to "sell ninjurs by the river".Stephen Hayes was one of the first Non-Japanese (and the first American) to study Togakure ninjutsu and the Bujinkan traditions under 34th generation Togakure-ryu Ninpo headmaster Hatsumi Matsaaki. He was the first American to be awarded the title "Shidoshi" by Hatsumi Sensei.

Wow. I just finished reading Miller's "Canticle for Leibowitz", and the first thing that comes to mind is that it is as relevent today as it was when it was first written in 1955 and '56. Don't be put off by the beginning, which at first may seem somewhat obscure. Nor should you allow the religious themes to be a distraction--this book clearly wasn't written as a diatribe for one belief system or against another. Miller uses religious and cultural allegories with which he is familiar. It would be difficult however, not to see the greater parallel with consideration for humanity's future in this well written book. Keep in mind that this was written during the height of the cold war, when it was normal to practice weekly or monthly duck-&-cover and fallout shelter evacuation drills at work, at school, in public in the United States (and elsewhere, I'd guess).Imagine an Earth not only post-nuclear apocalypse, but about 600 years down the road, after a complete cultural meltdown. No books, no schools, no motor-cars, not a single luxury (sorry). A Catholic monastary becomes a major source of preserved knowledge, taking its name from a former scientist of the nuclear age who repented his part in the destruction of Earth and encouraged the preservation of remaining knowledge with the hope that humanity could do better. Maybe it's religion's own penence for past eras of book burning and opression, but these dedicated monks are in it to preserve knowledge regardless of whether it agrees with their beliefs or not, dedicating their existence to the preservation of written knowledge the way bootleggers dedicated their lives to the production and transport of alcohol in the U.S. when it was prohibited. Hence the term Booklegger (I love it!).Just when you come to know a generation of monks, time moves on. Don't be disappointed, the next generation (monks and all!) is as fascinating as that which preceeded it. It wasn't difficult to recognize human elements of behavior, or to appreciate his diversity among characters. The development of character and plot are both excellent. There are 3 major time periods, each highlighting a different period in this new humanity's development. Some things are familiar, some not surprising, and a few are...unusual.One may take from this book any number of thoughts. The positives and negatives of religion, philosophy, art, politics and humanity in general are all present here. Like other memorable works of fiction, "Canticle" offers, to a degree, what the reader is willing to consider based upon that reader's knowledge. I believe I found the story all the more profound with the recently re-awakened concerns about nuclear power (and weapons) in our world. I came away from this book with a deep appreciation for what we do have in our world today, and a strong and sincere hope that we are wise enough to hold on to it and make it a better and safer place for our children. Read Walter M. Miller Jr's book and see what you think. And thanks, Dad, for recommending the book!

Originally published in 1978 by Ohara and since reprinted privately by J.L. Publications (and thus somewhat harder to obtain), this is the first in a three volume series by Master Teacher Joo-Bang Lee. This first volume of three covers history, Theory, Stances, Falling, Striking/punching, Kicking, and blocking. Included is a complete catalog of techniques from basic to advanced. The sequences of photographs are particularely good, with four to nine clear photos per technique. Volume Two covers joint locks, throws, sweeps and counters, defense from disadvataged positions (sitting, etc). Volume Three covers throwing, defense against weapons, striking vital points, a few cane and baton techniques, choking, opponent control, and defense against more than one opponent.Although there is some debate as to the historicity of Hwarang-Do as an "ancient" martial art separate from Hapkido and Taekwondo --Lee claims Hwarang Do has a completely separate native Korean origin despite its remarkable similarity to other forms of Korean martial art such as Hapkido and Kuk Sool-- this debate does nothing to detract from the technical expertise evident in the presentation of this book and the two which follow it. Author Lee Joo-Bang was at one time a direct (and senior) student of Hapkido founder Choi Yong-sul, and part of an original core group of dedicated martial arts men in Korea who traded techniques with one another in a progressive and friendly manner. Eventually due to competition these bonds of brotherhood dissolved, and today there is a lot of mystery and quarreling over what happened in those early days to cause so much dissention. A special attraction of this series of books is that most of the techniques are demonstrated by Master Joo-Bang Lee himself, and not younger students, the rare exception being a series of spectacular flying/jumping kicks shown by his eldest son, Henry Lee.Among the few faults I can find with this series of books is the format of the book itself (not the actual layout). I believe Lee's work would benefit greatly by being reintroduced in a larger format, and certainly a reworking of the section on history could include a number of the photos from his collection and personal recollections of the "early years" which impacted so much on Korea's modern martial arts. Hwarang-Do is certainly worthy of a nice large, hardcover volume built to last. Then again, these paperback editions offer affordability and easy access to the general public. For that reason and for the quality and scope of technique presented, Lee's three volume collection is absolutely worthwhile including in any martial arts collection!

I have found no other Judo or martial arts work that approaches the academic level of this one in scholarship and completeness. Draeger and Ishikawa have been VERY thorough in their assessment of HOW to train for Judo, offering for the first time a catagorized breakdown of training techniques into four areas: Preparatory, supplementary, compound, and auxiliary. Training is approached for the first time in English, as a scientific undertaking which like many other sports, is based upon and helped by the study of kinesiology (study of movement, body &amp; muscle, etc.). The authors don't simply tell us, they give us the &quot;why&quot; of things. Helpful diagrams and quality sequence photographs help convey the ideas, though I wouldn't recommend this volume for someone who doesn't have the patience to read. Training methods utilizing partners, weights, belt, equipment, and gravity are detailed. Originally printed in 1962, This recent re-release paperback edition is affordable and a welcome return. Don't let the age of publication dissuade you from learning from this volume, it was revolutionary upon its oroginal release, and little approaching its depth has been published in the popular press since. There is another terrific judo book by Draeger &amp; Inokuma which I hope Tuttle will consider rereleasing again soon, called &quot;Weight Training for Championship Judo&quot;, which goes even deeper into advanced sports theory. Judo was Draeger's first martial art, and I was surprised years ago to discover how deep and ground breaking his research with Kodokan colleagues had been. Altogether a superb volume.

This was one of the first economical Tang Soo Do books, first published in 1980. Author Henry Murphy offers the basic philosophy and techniques to 7th gup (orange belt) in Moo Duk Kwan style of Tang Soo Do. The information here is both basic and brief. You will not find much on history, and there is only one picture of Grandmaster Hwang Kee standing with C.I. Kim. For the beginner, this is a nice little volume, focused as it is on the foundations of the art. The three hyung included in this book are the Ki Cho Hyung Il Bu (first), Ee Bu (second), and Sam Bu (third). The tenents of Tang Soo Do, philosophy, et cetera. for a more thorough volume on this specific style, try Kang Uk Lee's &quot;Tang Soo Do&quot;. If you're afraid you'll skip ahead and want to stay focused on the fundamentals, this book is perfect.

Author Greg Sarris offers up a phenomenal generational triptych of Northern California Native American life between about 1920 and close to present, detailing the experiences and perspectives of three generations, Grandmother, Mother, and Son (although not in that order). We have the Waterplace Pomo, a fictionalized tribe, splintered by the forces around them, namely land encroachment, cultural encroachment, and tribal comflict. Sarris sets the book up in a mixed chronological order, thank goodness nowhere as confusing and spartan as Faulner's "The Power and the Fury". We're introduced first to Johnny, son of Iris, grandson of Elba.Johnny opens the book in near-present time, living in wrong-side-of-the-tracks South Park at the edge of Santa Rosa, where many Waterplace Pomo Indians, as well as Black and poor Mexicans live. Johnny is intent on trying to find a place, torn between his Native American culture and the Anglo world. Moreover he is coming into manhood and discovering his true self and place, while trying his darndest to keep his tribe together. Johnny is constantly trying to understand the connections and perspectives of fellow tribal members at odds with one another. His world is turned upside down by the arrival of another tribal member, Felix--who seems much more concerned with his own image and standing. Despite the facad of confidence and arrogance, it is Felix who disrupts tribal goings-on with his own lack of self knowledge and fragile confidence. He almost manages to destroy Johnny...a lesson for those confronted by such people!Elba's narrative is a good fictionalized account of Native American life in Northern California during the 1920-50 period. Splintered tribes, extreme conflicts between tribal leaders who preach against all things Anglo even when it is apparent that there is no other way for tribal survival other than mixing to a degree with the people and cultures who now surrond the belagured Waterplace Pomo people. The strong tribal leader, Big Sarah, creates more disharmony by excoriating members who act "white" by going to school, or conceive children outside the tribe, while offering no apparent alternative to the crude survival methods of earning bread money through sexual favors and working for surrounding white families. Caught up in this fundamental battle between a non-bending tribal leader and external forces, many of the upcoming generation, including Elba, are prone to the ensuing circumstances.The last portion of the book is given to Iris. Iris seems at odds with her indian heritage, which she clearly understands from the whites around her not to be a good thing! She excelles at school, but is frustrated by her mothers encouragement to see and hear the cultural essences of her roots. Elba never clearly instructs Iris, waiting in vain for something intuitive to kick in. It does not. The tie that binds this family together, Iris end up living away from the rest of the tribal members, living a relatively Anglo life, but nonetheless never truely feeling at peace with herself. The strongest undercurrent here is the relationship between Iris and Her mother, Elba.Iris is the product of a rape by a gang of white men--although Elba never tells her this. To Iris, Elba blames her own prior ways as a "floozy", perhaps as a means of freeing Iris from fear, or not trying to poison all white people (as Big Sarah had). After all, Iris is half white...Unfortunately this doesn't prevent something similar from happening to Anna, Iris's tribal and school friend. After Iris has witnessed the rape of Anna and remained crounched in fear, her mother rebukes her. The result is that Elba, never feeling fully Indian, not knowing the language, flees her mother and the South Park Neighborhood.There are many floes in this river. Standing out are the many connections people can never break--especially between domestic servants and the families they work for, and other tribal members. While the dominant characters with Elba and Iris are female, two poignent men who stand out are Old Uncle, repository of tribal knowledge who seems to just graze Elba with his healing and grace. Then there is the surprising Patrick Polk, son of the rather domineering and sinister father who once employed Elba. Both suggest repetitive patterns as the tale progresses, and both lead Iris, Johnny and Elba to change the way they act and think for the better, suggesting that acceptance of one's self (Indian, Mixed Heritage, man, woman, gay, straight, etc) is at the core of healing and redemption.There is no easy ending, no happy solution to life's problems here--as the book ends, people are still busy trying to resolve issues. But they have not given up, and perhaps that is the key to Sarris's tale.A terrific story, with much to be said for its attention to detail, both the complicated connections and emotions of the characters, and their community. I didn't want it to end! To heck with this being a great book by a Native American, it is just a SUPER BOOK! This would make a terrific read in an advanced high school or a college setting. Especially when considering the undervalued existence of Native (pre-Spanish and Anglo) Americans in California.For those interested in Northen California's Indian culture, from the top down, I would recommend "When the Great Spitit Died: the Destruction of the California Indians". If you can stomach a non-fiction book, really-READ THIS FIRST. if not, hey, catching up won't kill you! :)

Daeshik Kim is one of my favorite martial arts writers. In the past he has written basic books on karate and judo as well as in-depth works on Taekwondo and karate sparring, Hoshinsul (self defense), and just about the only intellectual treatment of WTF (Olympic style) Tae Kwon Do forms and theory. In "Martial Meditations: Philosophy and the Essence of the Martial Arts" (1989), Kim and Allen Back address the reader as a professor might instruct a class at a university. This is a high-level book I found interesting from cover to cover. Part anthropology text, part history text, part psychology text, and part kinestheology text, the authors go from an explanation of their methodological considerations beginning on page 1, through detailed explanations of development, history, influence of culture upon culture, contemporary martial arts customs, etc.Back and Kim connect Eastern and Western thought, include various experiments, and show their findings and thoughts in a multi dimensional manner. This is everything but martial arts for dummies. The authors draw examples from a wide variety of martial arts (judo, kung fu, aikido, taekwondo, karate, boxing) and used the lense of science and study to view them...vice versa as well. There is not a bias here towards one particular martial art or culture, nor is their any denial going on about certain aspects of history.The table of contents pretty much shows you all of the details:Introduction: Methodological Considerations-East Versus West-Talk Versus Action-Faith Versus ReasonI. The Nature of Martial ArtsChapter 1: A Short History of the Eastern Martial Arts-Origins-Development of Different StylesChapter 2: The Martial Arts Today-Contemporary Practices in the Martial Arts-The Current Variety of the Martial Arts-Rank SystemsChapter 3: What is a Martial Art?-Do and Jutsu-Martial Art and Sport-Martial Art and Art-The Nature of Martial Art-ApplicationsChapter 4: Forms-A Survey of Formal Exercise and Drills-What is a Form-The Purpose of Forms-Evaluation of Forms-BreakingChapter 5: Sparring-Types of Sparring-The Goals of Sparring-Deficiencies of Sparring-Sparring Well-RitualII.

What I like best about Caesar Farah's "Islam: Beliefs and Observances" is the variety of information provided on the different sects of Islam. The author interestingly enough, published the first edition of this book in 1967! The sixth edition contains its own forward by Farah, dated 1999. This updated edition does away with some of the errors included in previous editions, including the urban legend propagated by some Islamic proselytes that famed oceanographer Jaques Cousteau converted to Islam (he didn't--this was disproven in 1991--Cousteau passed away in 1997 and his funeral was held in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris).At 468 pages, this volume offers information on the time and place into which Muhammad was born, raised, married, had a family, came into his beliefs, and rose to found a religion and rule an empire. Farah offers the early history of the Islamic movement as driven by Muhammad, his struggles, his personal life, influences upon him. Farah is generally thorough in the space offered, but doesn't delve into some of the better known major controversy concerning the Quran's historicity (for more on this, please see "23 Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad" by Ali Dashti). He does however approach other subjects touchy to many Muslims, explaining the story of the so-called "Satanic Verses" originally included in the Quran and later expunged by Muhammad, though he fails to discuss the modern controversy caused by the well-known author of fiction, Salman Rushdie due to his work of fiction by the same name.Author Caesar Farah explains not only the basics such as what Muslims believe, who Muhammad was, etc., but also why there are different sects in Islam, how those sects came about, what they believe, why they strive against one another, and vital information concerning other prominent leaders of different Islamic movements through the ages. Among the various groups expounded upon are the Kharijites, Ismailis, Shia, Qarmatians, Assassins, Druze, Nusayris, Matawilah, Zaydis, Shiah extremists, Sunnism, as well as the various sources of Islamic power and the main schools of Islamic jurisprudence (legal precident). Too numerous to name here, concepts such as sunnah, Adat, Jihad, and a number of others are explained in detail, including common as well as radical interpretations. Farah offers an independant history for each, including names of prominent scholars and the dates of their founding.Farah also covers the span of knowledge from the formal (fundamentalist) to free thought (sufi). He explains the ultra conservative radical Wahhabism founded in 1744 by Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahab, its spread, and the challenge to modernists, rationalists and reformers. Pertinent to our times, Farah explains the "church and state" conflict in nations where the majority of the populace are Muslims, such as Turkey. He covers current trends to the date of publication (1999), and explains in an understandable way the modern conflicts that have arisen between Quranic literalists and modernists, covering issues such as women, technology, governmet in brief but succinct fashion. I liked the fact that Farah was not simply parroting generalities, but actually footnoted his sources throughout the book. He does a good job of explaining each topic in its historic and religious context, thankfully avoiding the tendancy of many authors on this subject to give short all-encomapssing explanations based upon their own personal belief.There is an excellent bibliography containing a variety of diverse sources, as well as a helpful glossary of common Islamic terms and an index. If you want just one book to understand the basis of Islamic thought and culture over time and in the present day, this is the book to read.

This was written in 1961, after Koichi Tohei's first volume, "Aikido: The Arts of Self Defense" (1960). At that time, Tohei was Chief Instructor of the Aikikai. Later on because of politics, conflict, and all of that, Tohei formed his own organization, and for a while stopped using the term "Aikido" in favor of the term "Ki" (same as Chinese "Chi").Tohei explains the principles of Aikido in plain easy to understand language. Included throughout are numerous photographs and illustrations. The inside portion of the book shows a stately Ueshiba Morihei Sensei (founder of Aikido), and a young Ueshiba Kisshomaru, as well as a young Tohei!Principles such as ki, as well as a demonstration of 15 techniques explaining balance, rotation, physics, etc. Good chapters at the end about the history of Ueshiba Morihei Sensei and also Tohei Sensei. Earlier editions of this book were issued by Rikugei Publishing, the later paperback edition by Japan Publications, the same company that did Mas Oyama's What is Karate and Kazuo Kudo's Dynamic Judo, so the quality is definately there.

I am among those who are very pleased to see so many works by Okinawan martial artists become available in the English language. In &quot;Tales of Okinawa's Great Karate Masters&quot;, translated by Patrick McCarthy, Shoshin Nagamine offers an honest look at the roots of the art he practiced and taught for over 50 years. This is not a 'how-to' karate book, there are no technical pictures although there are some decent historical pictures of people and documents, and some illustrative ones of the author, Nagamine.If you have Nagamine's first book, translated into English as &quot;The Essence of Okinawan Karate&quot; and focusing mainly upon the 17 kata of Matsubayashi Ryu Shorin Ryu Karate (an Itosu-ha lineage), this second work of his provides the literary heart of the art. It does not dwell merely on the roots of Nagamine's style, but includes fascinating information on a myriad of styles, teachers, Okinawan history, and karate folklore. There is plenty of new information: this is not simply a 're-do' of old data. One chapter for instance, focuses on Okinawa's Native art, a form of wrestling called &quot;Tegumi&quot;. Book includes endnotes, and an Appendixed article by Nagamine called &quot;Okinawan Karate and World Peace&quot;.

Originally published in 1953, "What is Self Defense? (Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu)" was reprinted in 1980 by the Kosho-Shorei Publishing Company. The second edition includes introductions from James Mitose's post-conviction students, Bruce Juchnik and Rick Alemany, and advisor Arnold M. Golub.Most noteable as a historic work showing some of the earliest students of Kenpo demonstrating techniques including Mitose himself, there are also sections on Mitose's version of his art's history. Although research in recent years has shown that some of the pictures in James Mitose's book were taken directly from earlier published volumes on Okinawan Karate which were available to Okinawans on Hawaii at that time. Included among these would be a photo of Choki Motobu on page IV taken from the second plate in Motobu's book "Watashi no Karatejutsu", and Fusetsu Nakamura's painting of Daruma on page I taken directly from the second page plate of Mizuho Mutsu's book "Tode Kenpo" (Japanese). Most of the techniques Mitose demonstrates on the makiwara likewise are identical in their demonstration to earlier sequences shown in Motobu's books from the 1930's.Many of the physical demonstrations of technique show a number of people well known in kenpo history circles, including Thomas Young (practical mentor to Bruce Juchnik and Mitose's designated successor of Kosho in Hawaii when he left for the mainland) and William Chow (Teacher of Kajukenbo's Adriano Emperado and American Kenpo's Ed Parker as well as Bill Chun, Sam Kuoha, and others). Young and Chow demonstrate a technique together in a particularely clear sequence on page 42, with Chow as Uke.Virtually every technique demonstrated is identical to other schools of Jiu Jitsu common to Hawaii at the time, especially Okazaki's Danzan Ryu. The exceptions to this are the makiwara (striking post) techniques Mitose demonstrates on pages 2-13. These appear to have been staged as to make them appear nearly identical to the Makiwara sequences Motobu showed in his already mentioned book, "Watashi no Karatejutsu" on pages 14-18. In other words, there is nothing unique or even distinct here.It is really too bad that with all of the effort going on in both Okinawa, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States to preserve and reprint books of historic value pertaining to Karate and Jujutsu, this one has fallen victim to bad publicity, political fighting from different "Kosho Ryu" factions, and apparently, indifference. Regardless of James Mitose's personal life, this book is a treasure for collectors and students. To learn more about James Mitose in Hawaii during the 1950's, please see Charles Goodin's Hawaii Karate Museum website. There is also a detailed article about this book written by Goodin in the magazine, "Classical Fighting Arts" #3 (19-24, 59).The Mitose saga and the evolution of Mitose-lineage kenpo is really deserving of a book in and of itself. Maybe some day we'll get our wish! Early Hawaiian Kenpo deserves at least that.

This, like the other Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) books which have come onto the mass market in the last year, are loooong overdue (by about 10 years!). Rigan (Hee-gan) Machado introduces the theory of BJJ, his family's history (the Machado brothers studied under Carlos Gracie and are cousins to the Gracies), and then goes right into applied ground techniques: Arm locks (chapter 2), followed by Leg Locks (chapter 3), Chokes (Chapter 4), and grappling without a gi (Chapter 5).The best place to learn grappling is from a teacher, but for those without an extensive range of ground techniques who haven't the time or money to find a teacher, or anyone who just wants to see the differences down on paper this volume focuses almost entirely on the ground applications of techniques which many arts lack. Those who already have backgrounds in judo or wrestling will enjoy the BJJ variations of techniques with which you will, for the most part, probably be familiar with, in theory if not practice. Another excellent volume to consider is &quot;Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Practice&quot; by Renzo and Royler Gracie.

This was the first book on ninpo I read as a youth. Thankfully, I believe it did a lot to innoculate me against much of the...other stuff out there claiming to be "ninjutsu". Author Stephen K. Hayes actually was proficient in Karate (3rd dan), running a dojo in Atlanta, Georgia before hanging up everything and flying off to Japan to find Masaaki Hatsumi, a Ninja historian and one of the few holders of a legitimate titles of proficiency in traditional Japanese martial arts associated with the ninja of Old Japan.In Noda City, Hayes meets Master Teacher Hatsumi, and the two discuss martial arts. At one point Hayes is discussing the intricacies of a particular kata (form), when Hatsumi shows an exact imitation of it. For the first time Hayes is struck by the stiffness of the movements.During their initial meeting, in a discussion concerning the varied physical aspects of Taijutsu in Ninpo, Hatsumi describes making use of striking as well as locking techniques, when Hayes interjects, "Like karate and Judo combined". Hayes ruminates on how his original assumptions probably appeared to Hatsumi a lot like "...comparing ninjutsu to wine tasting and insect collecting" (page 40). What sets this book apart from others is the personal tone, the recounting of actual experiences and situations Hayes encountered. He does his darndest to paint a true picture and keep grandstanding and ego out of the picture.This is not an repetitive pedantic self help book (thankfully!). Hayes telling of his various encounters in ninjutsu training, with the Grandmaster and other teachers and students in Japan, and Japanese culture--new and old, are the best teaching tools.Hayes went on to return to the United States and pioneer the legitimate teaching of Ninjutsu. Whether you practice martial arts or not, this book is an eye opening experience, a real education.

If you decide to use this as a coffee table book, PLEASE make certain you have a STRONG coffee table! At 700+ pages, hardcover, high-quality glossy paper, this 12 x 9 book is about 2 1/4 inches thick and HEAVY!While He-young Kimm's volume is probably the best _compilation_ on general philosophy out there, the one glaring omission is the _lack of footnotes and references_ that prevents this from being an authentic academic work...it is rather, a work of art compiled by a respectable artist. As a work of beauty, I have seen nothing that compares to the big black and white photographs of Korean historical places and demonstrations of Hapkido techniques in a picture book. You needn't be a mrtial artist to appreciate the wonders of this book.

Another beautiful but hard to find judo book from Japan Publications Trading. Originally published in 1967, This volume shows some of the most elaborate sequences of grapplig applications for competition. Also of importance are the follow ups and escapes for each technique, most of which are not included in the smaller abridged version, "Judo in Action: Grappling Techniques". The variations included in this book are extensive and laudable, and definately set it apart from most publications. That Kudo also focuses on transitions from grappling technique to technique and doesn't just stop at going through the mechanics of each technique also makes this book something extraordinary.Contents include:1. Fundamentals:2. Pinning Techniques: (Main Points, Training Rules)Kesa Gatame, Kuzure-Kesa-Gatame, Ushiro Kesa Gatame, Kata-Gatame, Kami-Shiho-Gatame, Kuzure-Kami-Shiho-Gatame 1 & 2, Yoko-shiho-gatame, Kuzure-yoko-shiho-gatame, Tate-shiho-gatame 1 through 33. Strangling Techniques (Main Points, Training Rules) Kata-juji-shime 1 thruogh 3, Gyaku-juji-shime 1 through 3, Hadaka-jime 1 through 4, Kataha-jime 1 through 3, Okuri-eri-jime 1 through 6, Jigoku-jime, Sakaku-jime 1 through 34. The Joint Techniques (Main Points, Training Rules), Ude-garami 1-5, Juji-gatame 1-7, Ude-gatame 1 through 3, Hiza Gatame 1 through 4, Waki-Gatame5. Getting into the Grappling Techniques: Grappling Techniques as follow-ups to throws, Lwad-in by moving your opponents legs, when your opponent who is lying below you attempts to pull you to him, Lead-in by lifting one of your opponents legs, lead-in by lifting both of your opponents legs, controlling your pponents body from below--rolling him over, Downing your opponent from a standing position and moving him into a grappling technique, Lead-ins when your opponent is lying facedown or is on all fours, clamping your opponents legs, drawing your leg free.6. Follow-ups and counter attacks: FOLLOW UP ATTACKS: Pinning to pinning, pinning to strangling, pinning to joint techniques, strangle to strangle, strangle to pinning, strangle to joint technique. Joint Technique to joint technique, joint techniquwe to pinning technique, joint technique to strangle technique. COUNTER ATTACKS: Pinning against pinning, strangle againt pinning, joint against pinning, strangle against strangle, pinning against strangle, joint against strangle, strangle against joint, joint against joint, pinning against joint7. Background: Jigoro Kano and the Kodokan, Training Methods, The Road to Progress, Judo Matches-Bibliography-IndexA quality publication, the photographs are crisp and clearly communicate the crux of each given technique. If you're lucky enough to find aone in good or better condition, it may have a green dustcover and green box. This is one of the important out of print judo books, along with it's sister publication, "Dynamic Judo: Throwing Techniques", and a few others including Mifune's original "Canon of Judo", Draeger's works with Inokuma, Otaki, and Ishikawa, Ito & Sato's 2-volume "Vital Judo" series, and Kazuo Ito's "This is Judo". As Kazuzo Kudo studied extensively with Kano and many of Judo's first generation's masters, his understanding of technique and competition are important.

In the second edition (2000) of "Unante: The Secrets of Karate" author John Sells Offers a thoroughly interconnected mosaic of Okinawan Karate's broad history. A difficult task, Sells manages to present a detailed history of Okinawan karate as it can be ascertained from written sources in Japanese and English as well as interviews with individuals in this lengthy, heavy volume. He credits 20 years of casual and 10 years of serious research into Okinawan Karate to his benefit in this effort as historan. Sells actually attempts to provide a cohesive history of Karate in Okinawa and Japan--no mean feat considering some of the differences among the various styles. Moreover, he does a superb job of it! Although at some points some of the information is repeated, it isn't annoyingly redundant. In a work this complete it is inevitable that some information be re-emphasized when discussing related points.In eight single-spaced chapters, Sells provides overviews as well as significal details which most individuals would spend countless hours researching considering the periodacles, Books in Japanese and English, and interviews to which the author has been exposed. Included are footnotes containing usefull information from pronouncation and style name differences, to alternate versions of legends and accounts. Between pages 206-218, Sells also offers one of the most comprehensive Karate Genealogies I've seen published yet. While the chapter names don't begn to detail the fascinating minutia included in each chapter, at least they may give you an idea:-Chapter 1 The Early Period: An Age of Legends-Chapter 2 The Middle Period: The Founding Fathers-Chapter 3 The Inter-War Period: Okinawan Pioneers in Japan and Redefining an Art on Okinawa-Chapter 4 Modern Karate: A New Generation and a New Sport-Chapter 5 History and Developmet of Kata the Quintessential Element-Chapter 6 The Karate-Do Mokuroku no Kata: A Kata Catalogue-Chapter 7 Okinawan Weaponry Kobujutsu: Art Within an Art-Chapter 8 Philosophy and Fighting, Ethical Framework and Fighting Startegy-Appendix (Karatedo Chronology, Glossary of Terms, Insignias, Bibliography, Table of Figures)-IndexExplained are the legends and records of the old masters such as Bushi Matsumura, Higaonna Kanryo and others in the context of Okinawan history--much of which was intertwined with that of South China as well as Japan. Karate flows from China, to Okinawa where it blends with native Okinawan combative arts, or maintains a unique character which evolves through the years...When Sells examines an individual or subject, he isn't content to simply parrot the words of other writers. He engages in a detailed and balanced dialogue and weighs a number of factors, such as the period of time, ruling forces, other cultural influences, et cetera. A number of peripheral subjects are covered on the way, such as establishment of rank in Judo, then Japanese Karate, then on to Okinawa...a fad is born. Sells covers the birth of organizations, and their perhaps inevitable schizms, the rise of styles, and various historical mileposts along the way. There is page upon page of genealogical charts covering Karate (Okinawan & Japanese), as well as KobudoSells explains who each master studied with, the points they taught (kata, special technique, relevant philosophy), how various teachers were related. Sells has done an admireable job of providing history for karate men and styles which are often left off of the history pages of may other books (the previously mentioned names are but a small example). Many acounts, not much personal opinion or commentary. Sells also discusses the organizational politics of the early Okinawan Karate organization, splits, causes, and factions (193-201). An interesting observation is the level on which so many of the early teachers from the same generation were good colleagues rather than competitors. In today's atmosphere between the business maneuvering, "ownership" of students, fees and dues, and parsing out of (often questionable) information drawn out over many (often unnecessary) years, such a level of brotherhood and sharing among fellow practitioners seems unusual. One example the author provides of this brotherhood from the "old times" is the relationship described between Okinawan Karate and Kenpo teachers Shigeru Nakamura, Zenryo Shimabukuro, and Joen Nakazato, as well as their various students, including Seikichi Odo, Fuse Kise, Shi'an Toma, and Seiyu Oyata (pages 190-193). In the early days, these men shared kata, exchanged ideas, and encouraged students to learn from a variety of fresh sources. Now-a-days, many of these men compete against one another for students, some claiming to have "secrets" the others somehow missed during all those years of brotherhood, and where freedom was the tool of learning, now forbid practicing at other schools.Now, one of my few pet peeves with this lovely labored-over tome... Sells shows a number of photos for which he lists the source as, "Sells' colection" when the grain of the print clearly shows these pictures issue forth from other sources (such as Kanei Uechi's "Okinawa Karate Do"). Would it have been so hard to list the book and page these photos were taken from? In an academic not-for-profit work, would giving proper credit really have been so difficult? Granted the source is probably in the bibliography, and this is one step closer to respected academic work than the newsstand magazines and the herds of basic books out there...maybe in the 3rd edition?Copious photographs and drawings throughout. This is EASILY the most serious, COMPLETE and far reaching effort to document a cohesive Okinawan Martial Arts history. This is the Bible of Okinawan Martial Arts History.

...While there isn't a whole lot of technical information in this volume that differs much from things already written in other self defense books (after all, there are only so many ways to hit an attacker with an elbow while tuning around), this work is one of the few &quot;non-traditional&quot; martial arts studies which presents its information in a progressive SYSTEM. The material presented here covers a range of topics which one would generally have to find in a number of different books by various authors. Although the technical information is basic (that is to say, not complex), this is not a book that was written for stupid people. The presentation and coverage is thorough enough that advanced martial artists and individuals with no specific previous training who would like to build a base of knowledge for no-nonsense self defense training can benefit from reading this book. Although my own background is in &quot;traditional&quot; martial arts, the materials here are remeniscent of the short courses taught to military and police, without the militaristic formality.Each topic (unarmed, knife, baton, gun, etc) includes a detailed theoretical explanation, and then offers photographic sequences to clearly illustrate the points. There is no ceremony, and no wasted space in this book. The ideas presented here are logical, the manouevres straight forward and simple, having been developed with the idea that any person regardless of athletic acumen, whether a clerk or a soldier should be able to effectively apply them quickly and easily. There is sound advice on using every day items for defense, sensible methods of conduct and dress, dealing with violence, and mental training. The authors do not dwell on deep time-consuming philosophical ideas, although as with most martial practices, Krav Maga does have a basic ethical thesis: don't get hurt, act modestly, act correctly, and become proficient (page 3-4). As with every defensive art, the thing which will make you most successful is practice, practice, practice.For history buffs, the section about the authors includes an interesting if short recounting of the training and experienced of Imi Sde-Or, including photos of his father, Samuel Lichtenfeld, and Imi as a young man in Europe (pre-1940), showing an incredible physique developed through athletic persuits including wrestling and boxing (pages 223-227). Sde-Or died in 1998, co-author Eyal Yanilov is his successor. The inclusiveness and price of this book make it an attractive find.

Funakoshi Gichen was many things to many people. Although today he is for the most part remembered and respected as the founder of the style we know today as Shotokan, Funakoshi Gichen was also a school Teacher, a family man, a man educated in the Confucian classics, a practitioner and teacher of Karate, and an Okinawan who undertook the task of bringing the art of Karate-Do from its native island of Okinawa to the Japanese Mainland in his later years.Remarkably, Funakoshi lived through several important eras in Okinawa and Japan's history. As a young man he recounts the impact of Meiji-era forced modernization, where men holding public posts were required to cut their traditional top-knots. His accounts of training with Master Itosu and Master Azato and stories of their explaits are some of the most specific known to us. Funakoshi also describes the sacrifices he made to continue practicing Karate while on Okinawa, at one point turning down a promotion because the travel would have separated him from his karate teachers. We learn how Yasutsune Itosu was instrumental in helping make karate a part of the physical culture curriculum in Okinawa's schools, and later how Funakoshi's background as an educator and karateka made him the ideal candidate to travel to Japan to demonstrate karate.Funakoshi describes how his extended family of 10 in Okinawa struggled to make ends meet on his teacher's salary of 3 yen a month, scraping by only because of the diligence of his wife, who grew vegetables and wove cloth to help make ends meet. His wife he tells us, also became adept at performing Karate kata, which she practiced to raise her spirits when tired (page 39)!Funakoshi initially came to Japan to demonstrate karate, was invited to the Kodokan by Jigoro Kano and ended up teaching Kano some basic manouvers which are now included in the Judo curriculum. Perhaps it was his exposure to Judo that led him to stay in Japan and undertake the task of teaching Karate with the hope of popularizing it among the masses. Maybe he was just a teacher at heart, and he finally realized an opportunity to combine the two subjects he enjoyed--teaching and karate.In the beginning of his stay in Japan, Funakoshi started with virtually nothing, taking employment as a groundskeeper and watchman, at times having to pawn his personal belongings for basic necessities. His efforts did eventually pay off in spite of his evidently gentlemanly good manners and lack of hard-driving salesmanship. Keio University took an interest, with Takushoku not far behind...and from here, the establishment of Funakoshi's karate began to take root in Japan.Throughout the book author Funakoshi mentions specific events and people, peppering his writing with funny and interesting anecdotes. A first class view of a specific period in time during which an art travelled from a village in Okinawa, to Japan, then world.

I found a nearly perfect copy of the 1967 Dake's edition at an estate sale a few years ago, and purchased it along with a well-worn Scofield Bible. Since I've always had trouble keeping the different sects of Christianity straight in my mind, I thought they would be helpful in understanding some of the more recent trends in Christian thought, such as dispensationalism (the belief that God has different expectations of people at different points in history), etc. I was pleased to discover the many comments throughout and charts in the back explaining many of the beliefs common among some (not all) Charismatic (and others, I'm sure) Christians. Dake's Bible is full of commentary and a mind-bogglingly fascinating number of lists. The commentary is right there in the columns next to the text for easy reference--of course it is his opinion, and he doesn't list what other books or materials may have inspired his thoughts.As I understand it, Charismatic Christians believe in gifts such as prophecy, visions, speaking in tongues, revelation & authority given--and this is the line of Christianity in which Dake included himself. Since another reviewer asked about a racist footnote in the Acts 17: 26 (c), which notes, "See 30 reasons for segregation of races, p. 159", I thought I'd share what I have in my original edition here.Page 159 of my 1967 edition notes in one of the side lists titled "30 reasons for segregation of races". Among the 30 reasons given are:"1. God wills all races to be as he made them, any violation of God's original purpose manifests insubordination to him(Acts 17:26, Rom 9:19-24) 2. God made everything to reproduce after his own kind (Gen 1:11-12, 6:20, 7:14) 3. God originally determined the bounds of the habitations of nations (Act 17:26, Gen 10:5, 32, 11:8, Dt 32:8) Kind means type and color or he would have kept them all alike to begin with. 4. Miscegenation means the mixture of races, especially black and white races, or those of outstanding type of color. The Bible even goes farther than opposing this. It is against different branches of the same stock intermarrying such as Jews marrying other descendents of Abraham (Ezra 9-10, Neh 9-13, Jer 50:37, Ezek 30:5) 5. Abraham forbad Eliezer to take a wife for Isaac of Canaanites (Gen 24:1-4)...6. Abraham sent all his sons of the concubines, and even of his second wife, far away from Isaac so their descendents would not mix (Gen 25:1-6)...19. Jews recognized as a separate people in all ages because of God's choice and command (Mt 10:6 Jn 1:11) Equal rights in the gospel gives no right to break this eternal law...29. Wearing Garments of mixed fabrics forbidden (Dt 22:11 Lev 19:19) 30. Christians and certain other pepole of a like race are to be segregated (Mt 18:15-17 I Cor 5:9-13,6:15, 2 Cor 6:14-18, Eph 5:11, 2Th 3:6-16, I Tim 6:5, 2 Tim 3:5[....]" (page 159 of NT)Recent editions no longer include the "30 reasons for segregation". A note from the Dake family website explains, "...And so in the fall of 1996, we discussed the matter as a family and made a unanimous decision to edit or remove any note that could possibly be misconstrued as a racist comment. The first printing to reflect these changes was done in January 1997"These "30 reasons..." are examples of separation via cultural, nationalistic, and ritual taken from various OT & NT books. Finis Dake grew up in an era and an area where this was definately a topic of debate in Christian and social circles--some fought for an end to injustice, some fought to keep the status quo. Racism and the use of Biblical text to explain, support or justify racism was simply a reality of the time and place--certainly not a logical or fair one.Seeing these beliefs practiced and justified by so many other Christian leaders of his era and previous, trying to understand why such a separation _still_ existed in Christianity despite the words attributed to Paul, etc., I am not surprised this one list on this topic made inclusion with so many others. The mention of "Miscegenation" suggests modern application, as Dake had to define this term in #4. This perhaps speaks of the danger of literalism and interpretation and how precarious it is to attempt defining or understanding situations far removed from their original historical context. Nor is Dake alone in this regard, for the footnote on the 1945 edition Scofield Bible I obtained contains questionable interpretations of the story of Noah, Shem, and Ham in Genesis, which also seems to have been noted by Dake.There are decent online sources available which give more of Finis Jennings Dake's personal history and beliefs. I did find this Bible interesting for the view it gave into a Charismatic Christian way of considering things. Clearly this was a labor of love and a lot of work went into it--hence 4 stars (I have no doctrinal opinion to share here--it is what it is).

Such a complex novel full of twists and turns! Just when I though I had things figured out plot-wise, something completely unexpected comes along! The fact that this book was written by an author who understands Jewish culture, having grown up in an Orthodox community in Great Britain no less, makes the reading all the more interesting. I see a kalaidescope of elements in this fictional work that I see among the community of people I know in real life.Reading this book, I observed compassion carefully woven into the story on many fronts, from Ronit's father who comes to understand that Ronit is not happy growing up in an Ultra-Orthodox setting and makes a special allowance for her...to Ronit's understanding of the impact her actions can have on the lives of other people...to friend Dovid, who loves Esti as she was made--and Esti, who can love Dovid and Ronit both with such sincerity.Naomi Alderman has also bridged an important gap. I noted that while many things she wrote could have come right out of Rev Krushka's bestseller and helped make me simply feel at home (observe the different fonts), they also served to introduce the uninitiated to important aspects of the Jewish cultural viewpoint vital to grasping the plot and its fascinating conclusion. Compassion and depth are two of these, briefly...if you are in the market for something unique and different imbued with the spice of life, please don't hesitate to pick this book!

An updated English translation of Professor J. Alberto Soggin's heralded Italian work covering the books of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. Soggin opens his introduction by encouraging both believers and non-believers to set aside personal prejudice and preconceived notions so that the Old Testament may be considered in its relevant historical contexts. The purpose of the Author here is not to convert or deconvert the reader, but to encourage the student to see the texts in a newly connected way considering a number of different perspectives. Reading Soggin's volume, I came to expand my understanding of how the various Old Testament writings developed.Soggin explains how these books came to be considered canon in the Jewish tradition and later by Christians, as well as the controversies relating to certain books. The differences between pronounciation in Jewish cultures (Ashkenazi vs. Sephardic), how "modernized" Hebrew came about in order to insure standard pronounciation of text, Palestinian vs. Alexandrian Canon, The Hebrew Bible (Codix Leningradensis), The Greek Translations (Septuigent), the Samartian Pentateuch, Aramaic paraphrases and translations, Latin translations, and...well, you get the idea.Soggin explains the differences between the "Yawahist" and the "Elohist" texts (usually blended together in our modern ranslations), their hallmarks, and how to tell them apart. He discusses the parallel histories of the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel and the sources of Legal and the Priestly writings, influences, basis, etc. Soggin covers all of the books, including all of the known deutero-canonical works (more commonly called the apocrypha), such as Tobit, Judith, additions to Daniel and Esther, Maccabees i-iv, etc. Soggin lists other prominent works and highlights the various disputes among scholars in each book's overview. Bibliographies are listed at the end of each chapter, which helps pinpoint specific works relevant to each individual subject.Includes Appendices on Palestinian Inscriptions, Samraritan Papyri, etc. and a Chronological table showing the relation in time between Israel, Judah, events in text, Egypt, and Phonecia/Syria. Indexed. This book isn't an easy read for the non-academic, indeed this text has been used in theological seminaries for years. I found my efforts at reading this book rewarded chapter by chapter. All in all, an excellent study and introduction to literary criticism in the Old Testament.

Ullman delivers with this collection of her best known hits of the '80's, pre-comedy. Many of the numbers are reminiscent of '50's and '60's girl groups in the U.S., and there are also plenty of original songs (If you're looking for the theme to HBO's 'Tracy Takes On', it's on this CD). If you liked the sound of the Go-Go's and Bangles, here's another CD you will probably enjoy. Most of the tunes are rockin' upbeat tunes that are fun to hum along with ( or sing, if you're alone :-) ), but that is just my personal preferance. With 16 tracks, you can aford to skip over the few clinkers--whatever your preference.

Sometimes called Muslim Boxing because it is popular among Muslims in North China, Tantui, or Dan-dwee, means "leg snapping", and is a form of Northern Chinese boxing which relies heavily upon the legs. Many styles include a 10 or 12 movement Tantui form as a type of supplemental training. Indeed the inclusion of other methods and styles is a hallmark of the Ching Woo Athletic Association. Chan explains this in the Introduction to Tantui on pages 2-3.Here the series of 12 movements is divided into 2 groups, 6 upper-leg movements, and 6 lower movements. These aren't simply ways of kicking, they are sequences of movements each consisting of 10-20 photographs with descriptions in Chinese and English (no worries, the English is understandable). An attractive feature of this book is the fact that Chan and fellow demonstrator Hui Tin-hing show each series alone, and then as a 2-man set.The labeling of the photos is clear, and with the instructions easy to understand. A well-executed volume which covers all of the necessary elements.

Have you ever done a technique and known in your heart of hearts it was highly impractical? Have you ever guiltily wondered about some of the promotion, rank, and respectibility games some martial artists play? Have you ever felt torn between ancient methods and recent technology? Bob Orlando broaches many of these unspoken topics which affect martial artists today.While this book does not tear down and dismiss altogether the traditional methods of training, Orlando offers insights into many of the concepts and practices traditionalists (including myself) have been wrestling with for a long time. Morover, Orland serves up these topics with good humor, and does not pretend to be feeding his readers any absolute answer. As a long time student and teacher of the martial arts, I found these views helpful and long overdue (in print, at least). It is nice to know there are others out there who often wonder about and question our &quot;sacred cows&quot;, and it is good to see someone who can do this without the snobishness of some so-called &quot;modern&quot; martial arts practitioners.Orlando's background includes Chinese Kenpo-Karate, Kung fu under Al Dacascos, and Chinese Kuntao and Indonesian Pentjak Silat under master teacher William de Thours. Here is a quote which I really liked: &quot;Rank[...] is excess baggage. It becomes a hinderance to learning because everyone expects that you already know everything&quot;.

For years I've read about China's Civil examination system, how difficult it was, how stressful. This book provides the first in depth explanation of how the exams were conducted, what students needed to know, how they were judged by their work, and where their efforts could lead. This translation of Ichisada Miyasaki's book by Conrad Schirokauer definately answers all of these questions succinctly.In mentioning the purpose and benefit of having such an examintaion system, the author conveys the ideals of a system built, ideally, to judge candidates (on the most part) on their merits and learning rather than appearence, connections, etc. Initially set in place as a way of weakening the influence and power of the aristocracy (an effective one at that), the examination system helped standardize learning for the civil service in China. Miyasaki points out the faults in this system as well, detailing some rather complicated methods of cheating as well as the scandals and ensuing banishments or executions which followed them.Although these exams didn't include anything concerning mathematics of science learning, they often demanded specific and exacting word-for-word answers from the writings of Confucious, the commentaries of Confucian scholars, the ancient poets, etc. Questions were often obscure...imagine having studied for years only to be unable to answer an obscurely worded question, all of that time wasted! Miyazaki also presents the reality of many students of the era--while the examination system was supposed to select based upon merit, it still cost money to travel to the exams, and to pay the chief examiner, to whom a passed student was likened a disciple of, the usual "gratuity" upon passing. Miyazaki offers a convincing arguements and evidence that it was still virtually impossible for some people to gain standing and position in spite of their true merit. Nor was the stress and wory done after one test! After passing the district exam, the candidate could look forward to taking the prefectural exam, another qualifying exam, Provincial exam, Metropolitan exam, and then for the very cream of the crop the Palace exam and court review. Whew! Oh, and then retests every few years to demonstrate continued competence.Interesting explanations of how papers were graded, disqualifiers, the amazingly spartan conditions available for students (you got to bring your own container to relieve yourself, not to mention your own food, bedding, etc--imagine coming from the other end of the empire!), and odd instances such as reports of hallucinations and at the local level at least, visitations by ghosts. Supernatural events seem to lessen as the competence level goes up, although in the cramped stalls these men occupied, often for several days it isn't hard to see how an individual with claustrophbia, schizophrenia, or simple homesickness might have broken down.I was pleased to see that in addition to the many levels of civil exams described, Miyazaki also offered an interesting view of China's Miltary Examination system, which graded candidates based upon the ability to hit targets with arrows, then a 3-portion test concerning strenth where the candidate would bend a bow of three possible strenths, then showing skill with wielding a halberd of 80, 100, or 120 catty weight by "brandishing it in front of one's face, swinging it around one's back and returning it to the front, and finally spinning it like a water wheel, all without toucing the ground" (pg 103), and lastly demonstrate ability to lift stones by weight. Lastly an indoor session where the works of Sun Tzu, Wu Tzu, and Ssu-ma Fa were used for a written exam--the Classics of battle strategy. According to Miyazaki, cheating was rampant here, but more likely to be overlooked as the disciples of martial pursuits were often viewed as little more than "semisavage military men" (pg 104)-- putting into place the importance of academics first, and then the martial.The best and easiest overview of this complex system, I ejoyed reading about the travails of this now-extinct system. Translator Conrad Schirokauer also includes a list of more recent readings on China's exam system in English.

At 255 pages, this volume on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eclipses virtually every other book on the topic. The amount of knowledge is superb, the presentation is terrific. Color photography throughout, an average of 6-10 photos per technique (including close-ups), and easily understood narrative descriptions which cover not just how to move, but why to do certain &quot;little things&quot; that make the difference between an effective technique and wasted energy.Although this book groups techniques by belt (recommended knowledge from white to blue, purple, brown, and black), authors Renzo and Royler Gracie, John Danaher, and Peligro describe rank in BJJ as an informal proceedure which does not include formal tests or specific techniques required, but rather continuous displays of proficient application and understanding which can be gleaned only through continuous and dedicated practice. It seems that BJJ, with its emphasis on ability rather than (buying) belts, is where other martial arts in the US, Canada, and Japan were 40 or more years ago.The only omission I can think of would be tournament rules for BJJ, but that again is something one would pick up from going to tournaments and classes regularly. This book is a terrific value, the best of the grappling books on the market today, in my estimation. A quality product well worth the asking price. I hope there is a volume II somewhere in the works, maybe even a biography of the Gracie family (looong overdue!). My other recommendation for those with an interest in NHB / MMA history would be the recently published &quot;Brawl&quot; by Erich Krauss. Good reading &amp; good practice to you!

One of two superb master-volumes by Kazuo Kudo on the techniques of Judo (the other being on grappling), I believe these original editions went through only one printing--in 1967. Later abridged editions were published under the title "judo in action: Throwing Techniques" If you're lucky enough to obtain one of these big "Dynamic Judo" volumes, it may include a red dustcover or box. In addition to including more information, the "Dynamic Judo" series is also larger than the smaller "Judo in Action" books.All techniques are shown in sequence photography, with detailed descriptions, tips and advice from Kudo. Contents include:Throwing Techniques: Preface, Contents, About Judo, Folio of Champions.1. Fundamentals: the throwing techniques, positions, standing together, where to look, body movement, using your strength, forcing your opponent off balance, preparatory moves and attack, falling methods, throwing traniing2.

Author Don Warrener's first book specifically about Goju Ryu Karate-do focuses mainly upon kata. Illustrated are the five basic kata (forms) unique to Gogen Yamaguchi's line of Goju-Ryu Karate-do (Taikyoku 1-5), as well as the first 10 kata found in all traditional Goju Ryu schools: Gekisai Dai Ichi, Gekisai Dai Ni, Sanchin, Tensho, Saifa, Seiunchin, Sanseirui, Shisochin, Seisan, and Seipai. This takes the practitioner to about the 2nd or 3rd dan black belt level, depending upon your school of practice. Some of Warrener's kata renditions differ somewhat from those of &quot;orthodox&quot; Goju schools--for instance, the ending on Saifa shown in this book includes a technique I haven't seen practiced by other Yamaguchi-line students (see page 144). Nevertheless, I appreciate the fact that this volume doesn't try to drown the reader in basic drill after basic drill to the point of monotony and questionable usefullness.Includes a chapter on Goju Ryu Karate founder Miyagi Chojun's tenents of Goju Ryu, and a section on history describing the development of Goju from Miyagi's early days with Master Higashionna to Yamaguchi's study of Goju which commenced during Miyagi's trip to Japan, and basic techniques (basics coverage is minimal--this volume assumes the student is receiving some sort of person-to-person instruction). There is even a photo of Warrener with Gogen Yamaguchi, and famed Canadian Sifu Frank Lee.While this volume in my opinion doesn't approach the technical detail of Morio Higaonna's precise four volume &quot;Traditional Karate-Do: Okinawan Goju Ryu&quot; (I haven't found any books on Karate which have!), it is the most inclusive of the lower-priced guides on this style. Warrener's succeeding book, &quot;Advanced Traditional Goju Ryu Karate&quot; follows up where this one leaves off. Warrener was a well-known kata and kumite competitor during the 1960's and '70s. He originally learned Goju Ryu Karate from Bob Dalgleish, and later advanced under the guidance of karate men such as Richard Kim and Morio Higaonna.

Nonetheless, Merriman, one of the "old heads" of Goju Karate in the United States, does dedicate a chapter to demonstrating the Kata for which he is famous, Seiunchin Kata. Most of the information presented here struck me as magazine articles collected into a book. Merriman offers chapters on supplementary exercises, training drills (1-and-2 man), Kumite techniques, refereeing signals, basic skills (right vs. wrong), and the kata Seiunchin. At 91 pages, this book was not intended to be an exhaustive referrence on Goju Ryu Karate. If you're a fan of Kata, or have an interest in any of the other subjects this book briefly covers, it probably won't disappoint. This isn't a badly done book, although I found the organization of the chapters was poor. This little volume is a fair supplement for Goju Ryu stylists, or those with an interest in active competition. I was disappointed that Merriman, with his many years of knowledge and experience, didn't take the opportunity to provide a thorough autobiography--he IS one of the oldest Goju stylists in the West.

Although this is still a terrific book for anyone with an interest in comparitive martial arts study, I didn't feel this volume was as thorough as the first in actually comparing Chinese Martial arts versus Aikido (Takemusu style). The second in a planned three part series on the Comparative study of Chinese martial arts and Aikido, this book includes sections on Aikido sword and jo (a staff about 36-50 inches in length), and Chinese sword methods. A paperback volume, the volume I own was printed on quality acid-resistant paper. I noticed an improvement in the quality of the pictures in this volume from those in the first.Author Sugawara clearly states in the introduction that the theme of this volume is to introduce the reader to the &quot;how to's&quot; of weapons training in both styles, so perhaps volume three of this series will cover what I felt was missing. As per the statements of the author, this volume DOES give decent coverage to the weapons methods of both Aikido and Chinese Martial practice. Both Tetsutaka Sugawara and Lu-jian Xing are versed in Aikido and Chinese martial arts (each has extensively studied BOTH), and therefore have a good grasp on the methods and philosophies of both arts. This has probably helped this series avoid any competitive air between these martial arts, where one might try to &quot;prove&quot; that one method is any better or worse than the other. This is the first book that has broached the subject of Chinese sword and Aikido Sword in the same volume--I look forward to the third volume in this series.

What a shame this book is so tough to find! Author Duk-sung Son continues where he left off 15 years before in "Korean Karate: The Art of Tae Kwon Do" (1968), covering advanced material. This book is clearly geared towards high brown/red belts preparing for their cho-dan (first degree) test, as well as black belt level practitioners and instructors.Son continues his style of completely examining each topic and answering just about any "why" a person might come up with. Throughout Son's tone is colleaguial, with advice given and concepts explained such as a parent might offer a beloved older child whom he wishes to see succeed. There is plenty to recommend continuous self-examination even for the highly skilled:"If an instructor finds that many students fail their tests to move up to higher belt, he ought to examine his own methods. Perhaps his standards are higher than his ability to teach" (page 13)Son also covers four additional black belt level forms, including Ship Su (hangetsu), Chul Gi 2 (naihanchi ee-dan), Yun-Bee (wan-su or Enpi), and Ja On (Jion). Son introduces this chapter with four solid pages of text explaining principles. One of several good examples of this would be:"There is a principle which pertains to all forms, but particularely Black Belt ones. If it is fully understood and is incorporated into the practicing of forms, it becomes a part of the way the Tae Kwon Doist moves and is of great help to him as a fighter. It creates the essential element of balance. The principle is that, when the body is moved in any direction, it ought to be moved as if the center of gravity alone is being moved. [...]" (23)Also of interest is the chapter on Women in Tae Kwon Do. It is clear that author Son rejected many of the "traditional" myths and stereotypes concerning female practitioners, offering insight to women and men about human nature and the realities of fighting. I believe also that the woman shown of pages 101 and 106 is Son's daughter, also an accomplished Chung Do Kwan practitioner.This volume is definately more inclusive of sport elements, explaining tournament competition, rules, and advice for matches. Contents include:1. Introduction: What, How & Why2. The Meaning of the Black Belt3. Four Black Belt Forms4. Women in Taekwondo5. Making the Black Belt into a Fighter6. Breaking Techniques7. Rules for Tae Kwon Do Matches8. Match and Tournament Fighting9. Street Fighting against an Unarmed Assailant10. Street Techniques against an Armed Assailant11. Conclusion~IndexOne of the better books out there on martial arts, specifically Tae Kwon Do and Karate.

This was the first Book by a Hopi person I read. It was also the first book by a Hopi person published. Mr. Talayesva was actually Hopi-Tewa, Tewa being a group of Native "Pueblo" (pre-Spanish native sedentary village dwellers) who were asked by Hopi to come and help defend their northern boundaries from Ute invasions (successfully), and thus assigned lands and invited to settle and intermarry. Taleyesva grew up in the village of Oraibi, and discusses his life from the story of his birth, his earliest recollections as a boy growing up, a young man initiated as a Hopi, and as a grown man. Very important, his experiences in every day life in Oraibi, experiences in ceremonial life and in the US Gov't mandated indian schools.I think what kept me riveted to this book was Don Talayesva's honesty and lack of manufactured drama. He begins by recounting his mother's pregnancy with him, how determined she was that he be healthy and resemble her husband, how she went to the medicine man when she felt pain and how he gave her a remedy to bind what he thought were twin babies into a single one (which turned out to be Don). The care his parents and relatives took before, during and after his birth. Talayesva describes the many family and community elements which bind the Hopi village together, and how he came to understand this as a young man through experience and being initiated through ceremonies. As a young man Talayesva sometimes gets into trouble and is corrected by his parents of other elders. His community's influence is important, but seems to wane as he begins to attend Anglo-run schools around 1900, where the traditional religious values of his culture clash with those enforced by missionaries and other teachers paid by the US Government.While the ethics of Hopi and Anglo are not that different, the dogma is, and school leaders strived to turn the Hopi children into something they were not, leaving them stranded between the culture of their parents they have been raise with and that of the missionaries and a new government with little extra guidance. Talayesva describes his exposure to other Native Americans away at Sherman Indian School in Riverside, his return to Oraibi etc., after a bit of confusion and settling back in clarifying his view of himself as a Hopi man.It is clear throughout the book that there is no attempt to misdirect or lie, this is a Hopi man telling about his life without embellishing. Talayesva speaks honestly about his experiences without regard to prudishness or how others might judge him based on modern anglo-Christian religious values. He does however show a clear sense of awareness of his own shortcomings and admits when he failed to live up to the ideals of a Hopi man's life. There is a lot of sorrow in Mr. Talayesva's later life, it is impossible not to sympathize and wish things could have been less painful for him.Albert Yava (also Hopi-Tewa) in his book "Big Falling Snow" expresses embarassment over some of the more prurient details Talayesva relates about his youth (pg 81) and suggests the Yale editor dragged these stories out of him, but on the whole this does not seem to be the case. Talayesva's narrative is arranged in a sensible way one would expect of any human who had not chosen (or been taught) to "sell" (or protect) himself by omitting events which weren't necessarily laudable. Moreover this was arranged as an academic work, not a best-seller tell all.This autobiography resulted from longhand-recorded recollections kept in Don Talayesva's diary. Talayesva met with Yale editor Leo Simmons in Oraibi, and also during Talayesva's stay in New Haven for two weeks in March 1941, reading through and editing together his autobiography. It seems the editor did eveything possible to obtain an accurate script which the author approved of. If it isn't a perfect model. This is the story of a human which reminds us to take care of one another and be patient.

While not a badly done book, The title is misleading. The techniques in this volume are very basic, what one might learn in the first 3 months or so of study. What is shown is clearly American Kenpo, and bears very little resemblance to any form of Chinese boxing. Basic blocks, punches, and a few kicks Nothing on history, this book would probably be of greatest value to someone with no martial arts experience who, due to circumatsnaces (such as living in a rural area where no teacher was available), had no other option for study.

This treatis on political Islam is helpful in understanding the mindset of violent Muslim Jihadists in today's world. You may disagree with the logic--or after close study lack thereof, in this book. I wish this volume included a better introduction of who the historical Sayyid Qutb was, it helps put this volume and what it was/is trying to accomplish in its proper context.Qutb (1906-1966) was an Egyptian novelist and literature teacher who received a western-style education and even earning his Master's Degree in Education in the United States, where he lived from 1948-1950. At least partially due to Qutb's experience living in the United States, he developed an anti-western anti-modernization attitude. While in The United States, Qutb was horrified to witness such lewd events as Church sock-hops, where a female could look a male in the eye and talk to him without fear of having a male relative automatically assume the worst and cut her throat. He wrote:"They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..."Whether this is what he actually saw at a church event in late 40's America (sounds more like Woodstock), whether it means Americans were dirty and immoral, or Qutb's own mind simply had a particularely laschivious bent which he deigned to blame other innocent people for, the reader must decide. The fact is that this "immorality" and events similar to it he witnessed in the West, coupled with injustices he saw and experienced in Egypt before and after his sojurn in the U.S. led Qutb to become heavily involved with the conservative Muslim Brotherhood upon his return to Egypt.After the attempted assasination of Egyptian President Nasser in 1954 by Muslim Brotherhood operatives, a number of Muslim Brotherhood leaders, including Sayyid Qutb, were imprisoned. While in prison Qutb wrote a 30-volume series on his interpretation of the Quran, "In The Shade of the Quran", as well as this book, "Milestones". Milestones is at its core a treatis on Political Islam. If you're wondering how it became vital to many Jihadi factions in the modern age, After Qutb was hanged for subversion in 1966, his brother Muhammed Qutb went to Saudi Arabia, where he taught Islamic Studies. Among his students was Ayman Zawahiri, teacher of Osama Bin Laden.I found this volume to be full of well-meaning idealism. Qutb desperately wants a just, fair society, for Islam to be THE ultimate and perfect solution to all human problems. With some limitations (namely on women and non-Muslims). He claims to be combating "Jahiliyya", or human ignorance of true religion. Included among the Jahiliyya societies are Communist and Western societies as well as modernized Muslim societies. Qutb it seems wished to turn back the clock and reconstruct an idealized Islamic society gleaned from his interpretation of Quran readings.Qutb's rationalizations are often circular in nature and hard to follow. It is often a case of 'the Quran says it, it is true!'. Quotes from the Quran compete with a few mentions of long-outdated Western scandals people must seriously research to understand (how irrelevent they were in their time, even moreso today). Little thought is given to obvious contradictions any thinking person would have. For instance while quoting Islam's Prophet Muhammed as having castigated Christians and Jews as idolators who had lost their way:"Whatever their priests and rabbis call permissible, they accept as permissible; whatever they declare as forbidden , they consider forbidden, and thus they worship them" (page 60)Somehow, Qutb can quote this absurdity while attempting to justify those who stupidly follow Islamic Mullahs and Imams, blindly obeying their edicts and fatwahs with no critical thought whatsoever! Few are more obedient than fundamentalist Salafi & Wahabbist Muslims--yet Qutb himself didn't draw the same logical conclusion. Namely that fundamentalist Muslims _worship_ and _idolize_ their religious Mullahs and Ayatollahs--not to mention Prophet Muhammed! The whole book is quite NEUROTIC and hypocritical in this way, swaying from one standard for those Qutb opposes, to another for the "REAL" Muslims, whoever they are (Qutb & NOT Allah decides)...On page 61 Qutub says:"It is not the intention of Islam to force its beliefs on people, but Islam is not merely 'belief'. As we have pointed out, Islam is a delaration of freedom of man from servitude to other men".Reading Qutb's "Milestones" makes it very clear thoughout that this brand of Islam is _all about_ making men submit to _other men_ (Specific Hardcore Fundamentalist Salafi or Wahabbi Muslims) who are justifying themselves by seeing who can say God's name the most, Martyr the most poor & desparate members of their society, and kill the most of the creator's creations who are unlike them in belief. They are men who, unlike the rest of us peons, think they have the "One Truth". Or so they tell the rest of us. Qutb also justifies the use of violence and conquest in his chapter on "Jihad in the Cause of God", speaking of Jihad as "...the movement for freeing mankind and demolishing the obstacles which prevent mankind from attaining this freedom" (65).Like many leaders in the Islamic world today Qutb constantly mixes the terms "submission" and "freedom". This is the most RIDICULOUS contradiction found throughout!!! Qutb sums up his school of thought with a quote from Sura 3:78 of the Quran on page 117: "In the world there is only one party of God: all others are parties of Satan and rebellion. Those who believe fight in the cause of God, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of rebellion. Then fight the allies of Satan...".According to Qutb, we are "free" to _submit_...or face the consequences! This is the "freedom" of Islamic extremism. What do YOU choose?

This was the second of what are now 4 special edition reprints of older karate books issued by Master Publication of Canada, run by Don Warrener (Goju). Although this edition of Karate pioneer Motobu, Choki's book is useful and should a part of any historical karate collection, there are several issues which anyone wishing to purchase this edition should be aware of.The photos have been retouched, severely. Most of what you will see are not reproductions from an original text, but apparently paint or charcoal reproductions (or extreme enhancements, if you will) of the photos from an earlier edition. I found these no more difficult to understand than photos in earier reprints, although some of the ambiance is lost. This Masters Publications "translation" bears a striking resemblence to the English translation put out nearly twenty years before by Okinawa Karate teacher Oyata, Seiyu in 1977("Okinawa Kempo: Karate-Jutsu on Kumite"). Comparing the two texts sentence by sentence, I could not help feeling that the Masters Publications "translation" was simply lifted from Oyata's earlier work, although neither Oyata nor any other translator is credited with this book's work, unlike other volumes in this series. I also found it odd that Masters Publications was not able to translate into common pharmacological terms the exact same herbs Oyata left untranslated. Certainly a professional with today's resources would have had better luck?Although This newer edition is beautiful (cloth covered boards, cloth covered box, dust jacket, etc.), I must admit that I treasure more the unretouched little booklet translated by Oyata in 1977. For an English translation of Motobu, Choki's OTHER book, contact Patrick McCarthy of the International Ryukyu Karate Research Society.

Tetsuhiro Hokama is one of the most prolific writers on the history of Okinawa martial arts. Unfortunately for most of us, the majority of his books are written in Japanese! This volume is a noteable exception, having been translated by Cezar Borkowski. It is formatted well, and includes samples of Hokama's flowing calligraphy throughout, along with translations.This volume is divided into two sections and eight chapters. The first includes three parts dealing with the history of Okinawa no Karate: Origins of Martial Arts, Martial Arts Pioneers, and The Evolution of Modern Martial arts. All three sections deal exclusively with Okinawan fighting arts and teachers, and there are plenty of photographs throughout, many which have NOT been published in other books on Okinawa karate.The second section deals with training, and includes 5 Training Guide sections and one kata demonstrated by Hokama. The training guide section (pages 103-151) is a sort of appendix offers the reader a sampling of different aspects of Okinawa bujutsu. It will show the reader--but is not a teaching tool per se.Section 1 includes 3 excerpts from the Ekkinkyogi on physical practice and internal power. Part 2 covers &quot;kappo&quot; rescusitation techniques (8 methods, includes photos-demonstrated by Wally Jay). Part 3 covers kempo training methods (hand-hardening/&quot;Iron Hand&quot;) and includes the complete Seisan (shorin-ryu) kata demonstrated by Hokama himself (52 photos). Part 4 covers kakie, two man body-hardening exercises, and includes 3 specific methods.Part 5 is perhaps the most unique: it offers a comparison between traditional Okinawa dance, and the Okinawa martial art &quot;Ti&quot;. The martial artist is shown standing side by side with an Okinawan dance master, in nearly identical postures. then an application from this postude is demonstrated.Hokama's book will serve Okinawa karate history buffs. Likewise, an individual with no experience in martial arts who is seeking information concerning this specific area of Okinawa's history will find this book an informative aid.

Another great title for this flick would have been "The Secret Life of Girls", because the behavior you'll see here is more akin to the ~actual~ behavior of Girlus Americanus than the silly flakes we usually see on film. Bawdy humor (female style!), a (too) brief men's bun shot, and even a bonus musical number entitled "The Pen*s Song" in the unrated version (Mucho Hilarious).This film is silly and light hearted, offering up punchline after punchline and twist after twist. I wouldn't say this is a "chick flick" in the conventional sense. There's none of that sappy over-emotionalism. Although the main actors are gals, the behaviors they exhibit are easily understood by both sexes. Ladies, you'll be laughing and nodding in agreement with the actors throughout. Men--not to worry, every guy I know has laughed throughout this movie, & two of my buddies even bought the dvd. Plenty of eye candy for guys & gals. If you liked "Something About Mary", you're gonna love this film!

This book was designed as a tool to teach adults how to read and pronounce the Hebrew Alef-Bet (Alphabet) for the purpose of reading and understanding traditional prayers and blessings. I found this to be a useful guide in learning the letters of the Hebrew alphabet along with their appropriate pronounciations.This book is simple and uncluttered. With some work, I can't imagine anyone would have difficulty using this as an aid to learn Hebrew. Certainly it will take some practice and work on the reader's behalf--notably, one should be willing to set aside some time each day for going over the letters and pronouncing them. With a few weeks practice, the blessings introduced in the latter chapters and included in the rear of the book are approachable. Also included are helpful hints for pronounciation, and the chart of the Hebrew Alphabet in block letters and script w/ Hebrew name (English and Hebrew), along with page reference for that letter.

...Chen Pan-ling was a practical martial artist who had a background in not only Tai Chi (Yang &amp; Wu), but also Hsing Yi and Bagua. The book not only includes clear photos (clearer than in my original Chinese version of this book) and precise descriptions of the proper movements and applications, but also descriptions of how you should feel. This is Tai Chi at it's most practical, not a new-agey easy to learn sequence.Chen was a pioneer in that he did away with a lot of the superstition and ritual associated with martial arts teachers at the time. His attempt at educated scientific study of this martial art is a welcome addition to the mibrary of the scholarly martial artist.

Gene LeBell makes learning fun with his humerous approach to grappling in all its forms. This volume includes techniques commonly found in Judo, wrestling, and a host of other martial arts from Asia to South America. Author LeBell commences with grips and handles, with gi (jacket) and without-after all the base of grappling is holding on to something (anything!). He moves on to slap and catch, and then a huge array of arm locks, shoulder locks, writst, hip, leg locks, chokes, strangles, cranks, counters against a boxer, and LeBell's own wide range of special tricks, many which are not commonly found anywhere else. This volume contains a wealth of information, probably easiest to assimilate for someone who already has a background in wrestling, judo, BJJ or some other art with a lot of ground practice--I had no trouble understanding most of the techniques illustrated within. You won't find much on judo-like throws here, but then this book isn't geared towards that. There are plenty of other ways to get your opponent to the ground illustrated in this tome.This is a big, heavy book--a work this complete has never been undertaken before to my knowledge (with the possible exception of the &quot;Fighter's Notebook&quot;). There are many practical techniques, many &quot;forgotten&quot; techniques, and everything from the practical to the incredibly difficult in here. For the conoisseur of grappling or martial arts in general, you will enjoy yourself!

This volume is NOT a &quot;how-to&quot; book. It IS a very thorough and detailed explanation of Kung Fu San Soo as originally taught by Jimmy Woo. For the first time, there is a decent explanation of Woo's San Soo Kung Fu history, which should put to rest rumors that he was an American Kenpo breakaway (he wasn't). Jimmy Woo, this volume explains, was originally schooled in Chai Li Fut (aka Choy Lay Fut) kung fu, and a chart on page 37 of this volume illustrates his lineage. Gatewood offers all the specifics of Woo's hostory, including his immigration to the US via forged papers (one of the reasons he changed his name--don't confuse him with James Wing Woo!). There are also some very good pictures of Jimmy Woo and other san soo folks. A lot of sensible theory is included in this book as well. I should add here that I am not a San Soo stylist, and have had no problem relating to or understanding the material presented in this book. Another good source for those wanting to learn more about San Soo KF history is the San Soo Journal, Volume 3 #4, which includes an article by a San Soo practitioner who visited Woo's mother in China, and described his converstaion with her (pictures included) concerning her missing son.

Wow. An insightful volume that is ABSOLUTELY worth obtaining and reading. It explains the HOW and WHY of religious development in and around the fertile crescent region to as far out as Europe and the outer reaches of India. This sheds new light on the relations between belief systems from just about as far back as we can know to the modern age.In these 711 pages author Martin A. Larson shows us how the early Egyptian religion of Osiris, Babylonian-Assyrian religion, Greek & Semitic beliefs influenced one another and altered the course of the history of belief. He does a terrific job of outlining each religion, from its claimed origins, myths, theology, ceremonies, prayers, historic events, etc. What Larson's overview style does is allow the reader to consider not only the context, but the impact one religion or school of though may have had upon those that developed later.There is also what I consider vital information on earlier religions which many people today have little or no knowledge of (they aren't exactly common!), such as the cults of Osiris and Dionysius, Ishtar and Zorastrianism, and possible influences from Hindu and Buddhist belief. Larson offers a stimulating if not convincing theory for the development of later Semitic beliefs, Essene religion, Hellenistic and other Paganism and the advent of Christianity. He explains how early Christianity developed and rose to power, recounting important councils that dictated the future and passed rulings deciding what was Official Christianity(TM) and what was heresy (a veritable encyclopedia on verious early herasies, indeed!). We learn how canonical law was displaced by civil law, and how Islam came to displace Paganism and seriously threaten Christianity, spread like wildfire across Africa and the East. I found Larson's work to be written from more of a humanistic perspective, and not biased from a personal religious perspective. He isn't trying to "sell" any one belief.Larson includes a bibliography of all cited religious material, a glossary and an index. An excellent overview of a wide varity of beliefs in their historical contexts. Also published under the title, "The Religion of the Occident: The Origin and Development of the Essene-Chrisyian Faith". This is NOT the same book as Larson's "The Essene-Christian Faith".

An excellent portrait of a little-known second-temple period Judaic People and the events which preceeded and followed them. Larson shows how the Essene culture pre-dates Christianity by using a vast array of sources (VERY impressive bibliography). He begins by introducting early religious concepts and showing how influences from Egypt, Persia, India, and Judea impacted the Essenes. Larson provides a helpful chart on page xii showing the Syrian and Jewish rulers under the Seleucid Dynsaty, which I found helpful when I was trying to recall what happened when. Larson also acknowledged the Dead Sea Scrolls controversy of the time, wherein certain scrolls and fragments were intentionally kept from a curious public. In hindsight over time, this doesn't seem to have had much effect on Larson's hypothesis here.Larson explores the relationship between Egyptian, Greek Pythagorean, Persian and Indian traditions, suggesting certain Essene concepts derived from these as well as Judaic sources. He compares the Essenic view of their own position in the cosmos based upon their primary scriptures, including "Enoch", "The Book of Jubilees", "The Damascus Document" (or "Fragment of a Zadokite Work"), "Habakkuk Commentary, Manual of Discipline", "Manual of Discipline for the Future Congregation of Israel", "Testament of the Twelve Patriarches", "Thanksgiving Psalm", and the "War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness".Larson makes a strong case for the Essenes being a Jewish sect which disapproved of both Sauducee (pro-Herodian pro-Roman priest class) and Pharisees (the pro-jewish teachers, often zealot), and shows how the Essenes disputed with these two groups over what calendar to use, what scriptures to use, and their meaning, strongly suggesting the Essenes at one point may have sloughed off the Mosaic Scriptures and Law for their Enochian Scriptures and Laws. Larson supports his position with quotes from Diogenes Laertius, Josephus, and others.One of the interesting cases Larson put forth is that Jesus of Nazareth and John the Baptist may have been Essene. Certainly the many parallels between the 3 Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Mathew & Luke), early apocryphal writings (Christian works that didn't gain church approval) and Essene pseudepigraphical works (Jewish works considered non-canonical), stressing celibacy and utterly rejecting marriage, demanding communalism and disallowing private property ownership, etc. do encourage deep thought! Larson uses early Church references as well to show how Early Christianity was taken from a celibate-comunistic belief system where members truely expected a return by the Messiah in "This Generation" (during their lifetimes), to a State-sanctified pagan-influenced religion which softened the original impact of the 3 Synoptics with edited Pauline letters and other forgeries, and postpones the Messiah's return indefinately (still waiting?).Larson makes an interesting case for Jewish diversity as well as Early Christianity and how one impacted the other, and how one helped drive the other from existence. An interesting read, he manages to tie this all together and provide reliable dating for a number of events without becoming redundant or boring! Contents include:Excerpts-Intro-AcknowledgementsChart showing Seleucid Dynasty (Capital Antioch) and the Jewish SuccessionPreface1. The Central Religious Concepts2. The Jewish Nation from Babylon to Vespatian3. The Cultic Evolution4. The Throes of Preparation (195-145)5. The Coming of Age (145-105)6. The Celibate-Communist Community (104-60)7. The Ridgid Cult (60BC-70AD)8. The Birth of Christianity9. The Ebionites10. Essene Gnosticism11. Comparison & Contrast-Appendix: The Reconstruction of the Faith-Selected Bibliography-Reference Citations-IndexLarson's later "The Essene-Christian Faith" (Philosophical Licrary, 1980) is a later reworking of this book with some changes. It has an increased page-count (273) because the footnotes have been turned into end notes. It contains some changes, mainly in writing style. I would recommend obtaining either book, you needn't obtain both. I like the fact that Larson doesn't have a particular Dogma, Church, or university to defend. This book (despite 40 years past its original release date) did a better job of helping me understand the Essene People and the early Christian Church than any other I have read to date. For an even more advanced and well-thought out book on the matter with the advantage of previously withheld Dead Sea materials, see Robert Eisenman's "James the Brother of Jesus" (1997).

Author Al Arsenault offers a complete view of chin-na (gripping/grappling) techiques for the ground, from initial standing position to the ground application. The level of this book is basic to advanced--a person with little experience (you'll likely need some grappling experience to understand any book on ground or throwing arts) can hone their understanding through practicing and studing the explanations in the narrative. Advanced concepts are also demonstrated and explained in an organized manner.The format in this book endears itself to study, with photos and diagrams clear and easy to comprehend. Arsenault goes beyond simply showing a technique which might be difficult to apply without an experienced instructor by explaining through detailed narrative precisely how one must manouver and position oneself. We also learn WHY the techniques and positioning are done as they are done, how they work, and how to get the most out of a technique. This practical and sensible approach can be appreciated by grapplers and strikers alike.The square construction of this thick book makes it less likely to flop shut when you spread it on the mat to experiment with the techniques shown within. All in all, a straightforward offering which can offer new ideas and applications regardless of one's style of practice.

...is must reading for those with an interest in Chinese martial arts and culture. The author describes his journey through China, the people he meets on the way including the legendary Teacher Pan. Quite a bit of the book describes his enounters with ordinary Chinese people and how be comes to appreciate the culture through his experiences. In essence, Salzman learnes to see things with Chinese eyes--including his martial arts training in Wushu.I also recommend the pre-quel to this book, "Lost In Place", Salzman's second autobiographical book, before or after this one. The two volumes go well together and provide a fascinating portrait of academic and martial growth. PERFECT for young people who are interested in martial arts as a lifelong pursuit, or anyone with an interest in Chinese culture & living in China to study.

Being a railroad conductor and generally a fan of snakes, I simply couldn't resist picking up "Snakes on a Train" for a depraved 2-day weekend reserved for lazing on the couch, quaffing copious amount of Dr. Pepper, inhaling chocolate, and thinking occasionally about the chores I should be doing. The gal at the check-out counter of my local dvd rental establishment gave me a dubious look and inquired, "You do know this isn't 'Snakes on a Plane'?" Yes, I knew. Apparently some individuals who couldn't read and can't tell a locomotive from a plane had rented it with higher expectations. I however was willing to take a chance, and wasn't expecting a masterpiece.It's entertainment. Hardly the worst I've seen (not as vapid as "Murdercycle"), but not close to "The Shining", or say the more recent "Jeepers Creepers". The plot centers around a Mexican Indian woman cursed by her own family for rejecting a wealthy suitor...the village shaman she chose instead accompanies her across the USA/Mexico border to a Southern Pacific train depot (yes, the SP of days gone by) where they coax thuggish stowaways in the baggage car into allowing them to board.Character development is weak, about on par with what you can find on late-night cable or the old USA Network productions from the late '80's through the '90's. Remember the flick with those slug-things that got inside people? Shades of that. Then again, If I wanted character development I would have gotten something boring and sentimental :) My major complaint is that there could have been a lot more spoofing and humor in this. About the funniest part was when the shaman runs over the top of the cars, finds the locomotive engineer smoking ~something~ out of a lightbulb, knocks him out a smashes up the engine's console--or what set crew thinks an audience will believe will pass for a locomotive's control console. I caught a glimpse of a picture which looked like it might have been the engineer and conductor laying down together shirtless...which really is neither here nor there, but provided the one laugh in a film offered numerous ripe opportunities for parody. The Conductor apparently forgets where the energency brake valve is and has some kind of breakdown...so when he is eaten by a snake, I didn't feel too bad. Incompetence!Of the snakes, plenty of Ball pythons (even an albino!), Boas and garter snakes...and waaay too much rattling for any of those. But I digress. There were some darkened shots of long-haul Amtrak passenger trains with Superliner equipment...and despite this, Amtrak (not to mention the Union Pacific, which owns the rights to the SP logo) did not appear in the credits. The crappy interiors of the crappy coaches used in this film date to the 1940's and thank goodness, are not used by Amtrak :o On second thought, It is probably a good thing Amtrak wasn't credited in any way for this production.So...to the frat boys and beer-blast entheusiasts, this is a good one to have on during rauccous gatherings when nobody is quite sure what is happening. And for railroaders on their off days...hey, you could do worse! Better to watch than work, right? ;)

If you enjoy curling up with a good martial arts biography after practice, this book is most definately written for you. Here is the opportunity to read not about one man, but about an entire family of superb competitors and technicians!This large, high-quality volume (same size &amp; style as his other books) includes a vast number of color &amp; black &amp; white photographs, many previously unpublished. Kid Peligro has utilized his friendship with the Gracie Family, knowledge of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and his access to the Gracie Family archives to present to us one of the most complete volumes on what may be the greatest martial arts dynasty of our time.Finally we can read about-and SEE!-the amazing Carlos Gracie, the man who studied under Mitsuyo Maeda and started it all. There is a lot of info on Carlos's brother Helio, as well as subsequent generations of Gracies including Rolls, Rickson, Royler, etc. photos include the men in competition, training, and in more quiet interludes with family and friends. This volume is fun to read, and includes many old pictures of the Gracies and their students from the &quot;old days&quot;.As did another reviewer, I too noticed the lack of info on recent events not in the Gracie family's favor, such as some of the recent defeats in both Brazilian Jiu jitsu competition and NHB contests. I find this odd as there is a thorough treatment of the only two defeats Helio Gracie ever suffered. Yes, the Gracies still win much more often than they lose--but why omit blow-by-blow info on recent defeats? That alone however, does little to dim my entheusiasm for this work much.All in all, this book is very worth the money. If you like to read about heart and spirit, I don't think there is a better volume in the martial arts field right now. The Gracie art is practical, sensible, and full of history. It seems an understatement to mention that the Gracies are a fascinating family.

A funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime Czechoslovakia. I enjoyed watching this movie, it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil. This is Czechoslovakia during World War II. The Nazis are officially in control, and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation. Our protagonist is young Milos Hrma, whose father is a retired railway man, spending his days sitting at home, looking at his watch, and telling everyone where each train is now. He encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot.Easily the youngest employee at the depot, Milos wants to fit in, be admired, be a man. He wears the uniform of a train dispatcher, but doesn't seem comfortable in it yet. While other reviewers have mentioned young Milos' talk of wanting to have sex, which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty, much can be lost in our descriptions. This is a comedy, not a prurient display. It seems that sex is simply the path Milos believes he must take to be a man. It is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot. This self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him. Some may be offended by this, in which case I'd suggest you'd probably be happier buying a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD. Milos does show himself a man...and it has little to do with s-e-x. Very worth watching!Some of the scenes are terrific--I liked the scene where Milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away and then...oh, I won't ruin it for you! It really is a funny film set in a heartbreaking time. All the more interesting that it was shot in 1966. Reccommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere. I wish that sort of exitement happened on my train! :)

I would never have guessed that this film was based on a video game--I certainly couldn't tell from the plot. Then again I grew up with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. I loved this movie!! I generally like more traditional horror flicks ("The Shining", "Jeepers Creepers") and have a tough time with some of the more recent films that jump all over the place with no explanation and nary a hint. At first I had my doubts...but watching past the first 15 minutes revealed that this is one movie that didn't have to add in a bunch of unnecessary junk to make up for what it didn't have."Silent Hill" was a perfect balance for me, an unusual concept (a coal mining town sitting on top of a slow-burning fire, deserted--or is it?), and logical but not easy-to-guess conclusions to events. Excellent unexpected effects! Things done in new ways! Creepy and wierd! If you enjoy scaring yourself now and again to remind yourself how lucky we are that we aren't going through something spooky and unexplainable like this, here is a film just right for a night alone when you want to curl up on the couch with your trusty milkduds 'n' a beer and scare yourself silly :oClose the drapes ahead of time just in case there's something under the couch...and turn out the lights!

This translation of _Taira_ Shinken's 1964 Japanese language book "Ryukyu Kobudo Taikan" has the benefit of having been translated by an Okinawan and Kobudo practitioner, Eihachi _Ota_, with Michael _Rovens_. Known in some circles as the "Funakoshi of Kobudo", Taira was instrumental in preserving the traditional weapon arts of Okinawa and bringing them into the modern age. Indeed, Funakoshi and Taira were colleagues, and Taira dedicated a page of tribute to Funakoshi in this book! (page 167)Included in this affordable edition are all of the same photographs and illustrations from the original publication which show Taira demonstrating kata and technique. Taira is also pictured with other persons of note, including _Fujita_ Seiko and _Higa_ Seiko (page iv). For those history buffs out there, also depicted in photos from the original publication are the Board of Directors of the Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai of which Taira was the president. Includes are photos of Higa Yuchuoku, young Motokatsu Inoue, Teruo Hayashi, Mabuni Kenei, and many others from diverse karate traditions. (pages 169-177)The first 15 pages cover the introduction and history of Kobudo, followed by 7 sections on kobudo technique and 6 kata (forms). The contents breaks down as follows:- Introduction- Profile of Taira Shinken- History of Ryukyu Kobudo- Items of Kobudo- Other WeaponsPart I: Bojutsu, Bo Makiwara, How to grip the Bo, Basic Movements with the Bo,- Kata "Shushi no Kun" (Dai)Part II- Kata "Hamahiga no Sai"Part III- Kata "Hamahiga no Tonfa"Part IV- Kata "Sueyoshi no Kun" (Bo)Part V- Basic Nunchaku KataPart VI- Bojutsu "Kingo no Kata" DemonstrationPart VII- "Kingo no Kata" (Bo)- Gichen Funakoshi- Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai Board of Directors- Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai Supporting MembersAll of the kata are shown in complete photo sequences, with the exception of "Kingo no Kata", which is every bit as complete, but shown with a series of woodblock prints accompanied with descriptions.While this is by no means a completely exhaustive "bible" of Kobudo, it is still in its age one of the best works out there. This is by far the best translation Masters Publications has released to date. I can't imagine any serious student of Kobudo forgoing this. A study in history, well-explained in one volume.

This is the English translation of the volume by Aikido Founder Ueshiba Morihei called &quot;Budo Renshu&quot; (&quot;Budo Training&quot;). Ueshiba Sensei's first book, this volume was originally published in 1933. Techniques are illustrated with drawings and accompanied by brief narrative instructions. The techniques are MUCH closer (in fact, nearly identical) to Daito Ryu Jujutsu than the flowing post-World War II Aikido, as Ueshiba Sensei was still associated with his D.R.J. teacher, Takeda Sogaku. You will also get a taste of the original philosophy of Ueshiba's martial art, as a section called &quot;Secret Teachings of Bu-do&quot;, composed of 38 poems he wrote, even includes one poem which alludes to the martial strength of Imperial Japan;&quot; 'Bu' received from the Gods at the beginning of the world,Is ours for protecting the nation:The Emperor's exhalted voice!&quot; [....]As most works on Aikido present the philosophy of Aikido developed by Ueshiba Morihei in the aftermath of WWII, this book offers a unique look at the art BEFORE it had reached its final stage of development. It was written during a period of time when combat was still necessary to survival, and a practical art was more likely to have a &quot;-jutsu&quot; attatched to the end of its name than a &quot;-do&quot;. This was Aikido in the days before deep philosophical theories and teachings based on love and flow. Ueshiba sensei was 50 years old at the time this volume was published. It is a lot of fun to go through this book and compare the techniques with those used in modern forms of Aikido, as well as related schools like Hapkido. If you're interested in the development of grappling arts or in considering the development of Aikido as an art, this book will be useful for you.

Yukishiro _Sanada_ is the pen name of Toshiro _Obata_, who is a martial arts historian and respected teacher of Yoshinkan Aikido as well as Swordsmanship. Why he used a pen name here, I don't know! (I think it is a play on, or alternate pronounciation of his common name). After all, the author does not claim any great authority or offer a spurious lineage. He presents this book as a demonstration of historical technique and display of unusual weapons which at the date of publication (1986) were rare in the public eye. Moreover his purpose in authoring this work was to debunk many of the questionable publications claiming to concern themselves with ninjutsu. Sanada/Obata writes about the 1980's ninja craze:"[....]Unfortunately this led at first to a whole spate of publications which were comprised wholly or partly of inaccurate information which has caused a very misleading picture in the public's mind of ninjutsu. In order to set the record straight we have decided to make information available that ahs not been published in the English language beofre, so that our readers can compare the authentic techniques we include here with those included in other less serious or well researched works." (page 1)Obata writing as Sanada shows the correct technique for throwing shuriken (sometimes called "ninja stars" or darts), and also demonstrates a unique weapon I still haven't seen covered in other modern (including legit!) Ninpo books, something called a Kaginawa, or rope and hook (not grappling hook). Also interesting is a demonstration with sword (which the author suggests was not among favorite ninja weapons). Several techniques are shown unarmed against either armed or unarmed opponents. Techniques using weapons such as Nicho Gama (two kama, or sickles), Manriki Gusari, etc. round out the book. Most of the techniques are based on joint locking or otherwise subding an opponent, there are very few striking techniques.A decent manual as far as demonstration of techniques, especially as an antidote to some of the rubbish that supposedly portrayed "Ninjers" or "ninjitsu"(sp). As with all publications I've seen from Dragon Books, nice thick paper, detailed photos, easy-to understand layout, and a fair if brief treatment of history. In comparison to many other publications, it is really too bad that these editions are no longer in print! Any of the books by Obata are worth reading, although most of his books printed by Dragon have been looong out of print and are either difficult to find or overpriced for their scarcity.

Byong Yu is a name martial arts historians will recognize from the late 1960's and 70's--he was a well respected competitor in American point and contact karate tournaments. Here Yu tells his life's story from his birth in Japan-occupied Korea, growing up with a childhood disability that hindered his coordination (he didn't speak until age 5) and nearly got him abandoned by his mother. He describes how he learned focus, found a taekwondo teacher, joined the South Korean Army at age 15 to fight North Korea, trained as a medic, lost a brother in the Korean War, and returned home to teach Tae Kwon Do in Sin Kil Dong, a village outside Seoul.Byong Yu describes some of the politics of taekwondo in Korea, and is honest about some of the problems associated with martial arts and the individual. He is continually examining his own tendancy towards violence and the authoritarian model of the martial arts teacher, writing:"By the time I reached the age of 20, such worship turned out to be a double edged sword. With more than 5,000 students under my control, I was a powerful person in the Seoul martial arts community. Because so many people were treating me as if I were an ancient emperor, I began to act like a dictator. My martial arts had become unbalanced due to youth and pride." (page 47)Yu relates his abusive nature, describing an incident where his Master Ko sent him to a rural village to test six students of the teacher there. Disgusted at the size of the humble school in the back of the local market, Yu used his position as a highly ranked teacher to heap physical abuse on the students, destroy a 50-lb sack of rice by kicking through it, and also kicking out a post holding up part of the market's roof. When he returned and tried to justify his rudeness to Master Ko, he was sent on a teaching "Mission" to another rural village, where he is told to establish a school.While the hardships Yu describes going through trying to gain students in this little town convey an important lesson, I had difficulty believing that he as a stranger could move in to a "...communal farming village where everyone paid a lot of attention to the singing birds and blossoming flowers" and get a people who were "...totally opposed to violence..." where he knew absolutely no-one, to study a pugalistic discipline. Yu is describing a traditional Korean Rural village where everyone knows each other and the families have been there for hundreds of years. Even more incredible in this setting is Yu's claim that at the end of the chapter that he had over 60 students including the Elderly (!). Small wonder he does not refer to this "village" by name! (page 52-55)On the other hand, Yu's description coming to America to start a new life (starting with Chapter 6) has the ring of truth. In Korea, he is a respected martial arts Champion and a Graduate of Korea University. He decides to travel to the U.S. to teach taekwondo. Yu describes the shame and confusion he felt not knowing enough English to do basic things. How after his arrival in the United States, through his own lack of understanding he fast became homeless and penniless.Particularely interesting was his initial fantasy perception of America as a sort of paradise, and the dawning realization that it would take a lot of work and effort to survive--as it does anyplace! Yu's story really could be that of a lot of immigrants who put their hearts into learning the language, going to school, and working--making themselves part of America. Once settled and enrolled at UC Berkely, Yu keeps up a hectic schedule of going to school, teaching taekwondo, and then working as a dishwasher at Denny's. Sleep is precious an rare, and like many students (now as then--I was there too), he survived mainly on a stately diet of Top Ramen.Another particularely interesting account is his association with Taekwondo teacher Kang Myung-kyu of Sacramento, who is referred to as "Master K". Kang is Yu's senior and was one of his teachers in Korea. Evidently, it was customary for established "Masters" to use newcomers such as Yu as virtual slave labor. Kang lavishes $300.00 dinners on the visiting sons of friends back in Korea, and pays his 6 Korean instructors $5.00 -- FIVE DOLLARS! a month. The account of Yu's confrontation with and departure from Kang on pages 83-85 is rare in print and a MUST READ! Such things are generally not spoken of among Korean Immigrants, especially martial artists.Byong Yu's story is worth reading. Although I didn't care for the "self-help" applications in the second part of the book, they do include personal anecdotes. For the life of me I can't figure out why on earth this book was marketed as "self-help". My biggest complaint is that in trying to get this autobiography to fit into the self-help mold, and including all of the student testemonies on the cover, it seems the volume has something of an identity crisis. Yu's honest autobiography is enough of a sell without having to repackage and gussy up this volume. It also would have been nice to see pictures of Master Ko, or training in the "early days" in Korea in the photo section and fewer celebrity buddy shots.I bought this book because I wan interested in reading about the experiences of a Korean Immigrant and martial artist, not because he had his picture taken with Steven Segal or Chuck Norris. That Yu is somebody is established through his deeds.

A decent collection of books which, for whatever reason, were excluded by the early Church (Catholic) councils from what became the Old Testament and New Testament. Initially published in 1926, each one of the "Lost Books" includes a brief introduction giving background and history. Like the editors of this two-part volume, I do not feel it is necessary to share my opinion of the historicity of these works, each reader can decide for him or herself what is shadow and what is reality, and consider the debate which at one time engulfed some of these books.This volume is divided into two sections. The first is called "Lost Books of the Bible", and includes works which deal with Jesus & company, and may at one time have been considered part of the New Testament Gospel. Includes are the following 26 "lost" books:Mary, Protevangelion, I. Infancy, II. Infancy, Christ and Abgarus, Nicodemus, The Apostles' Creed, Laodiceans, Paul and Senica, Paul and Thecla, I. Clement, II. Clement, Barnabus, Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, Polycarp, Philippians, I. Hermas-Visions, II. Herman-Commands, III. Hermas-Similitudes, Letters of Herod and Pilate, The Last Gospel of PeterPart the Second is titled "The Forgotten Books of Eden", and includes works which are suited to the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. They too were excluded by Jewish (and some Christian) councils due to doubts about their age and origins. Includes are the following 20 books:The First Book of Adam and Eve, The Second Book of Adam and Eve, The Secrets of Enoch, The Psalms of Solomon, The Odes of Solomon, The Letter of Aristeas, The Fourth Book of Maccabees, The Story of Ahikar, The Testament of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Joseph, BenjaminThis affordable book offers a thought provoking read for those with a general interest "outside of the box". While the translations are somewhat dated, they are not difficult to understand.

Here Nathan Johnson presents his treatis for the relationship between Buddhist philosophy (primarily zen) and martial arts practice. He considers authenticity in forms, and examines meaning and concepts related to shaolin. I don't fully agree with all of his premises, such as the idea that it is more likely a form is &quot;authentic&quot; when its practitioners credit a Buddhist or Taoist creator (many forms were assigned mysterious origin to make the school or founder credible), has a Buddhist name or title (like Ji-on in shotokan), is simple in its movements, etc. However, Johnson is one of the first who has had the time and energy to research his topics, and formulate theories based upon the how and why, as opposed to simply regurgitating and not questioning older information (the tiresome old &quot;sensei said it, so it is true!&quot; routine).Johnson also examines karate in the greater context of cultural relativity, pondering such oddities as the esoteric meaning of Sanchin kata (&quot;Sanchin is a mandala...&quot;), and tries his hand (well) at debunking many myths and mistaken notions common in karate and kung fu today. Johnson offers advnanced concepts. You don't have to buy all of his theories, but reading this book will definately encourage you to consider your forms and martial arts in general in a new light.This second volume is also a great improvement upon the first, as Johnson explains all of the things that I felt were lacking in that book. He relates experiences, correspondences, and includes footnotes and a bibliography of sources, crediting quotes sources. Johnson again demonstrates the fundamental forms of Sanchin and Naihanchin with their applications as in his first book &quot;Zen Shaolin Karate&quot;, but the reader has the opportunity to consider his ideas in a wider context. Throughout the time I spent reading this work, I was convinced that this is a highly personal effort, sincere and honest to its heart. Not a grain of arrogance or pretentiousness did I encounter in my reading. Johnson is not trying to force feed us, on the contrary I felt he was encouraging the same spirit of research and discovery among those who consider his words. A worthwhile read for the martial artist who is weary of the mundane and repetitive.

The first in a five volume series, this book contains Ed Parker's Autobiography as well as a detailed history of Kenpo as Parker understood it. Parker explains how he learned kenpo in Hawaii from William Chow, began teaching it in the United States, started the Kenpo Karate Association of America (KKAA), which became the International Kenpo Karate Association (IKKA). Explained are all of the symbols of American Kenpo, including the original International Kenpo Karate Association patch, Parker's original Universal Symbol.This volume goes beyond most basic introductory books in that it includes a significant amont of detail. For instance, in chapter 3 when Parker explains the three divisions of the art of Kenpo, including Basics, Self Defense, and Freestyle, he breaks each one of these three divisions into all of its possible components. Basics includes techniques, combinations, and kata, or forms, physical and mental conditioning, etc. Parker explains each specific term, why it is important and how it applies. Additionally there is a glossary in the back of the book which covers all of the kenpo specific terms used in the book. If you need to refresh on the difference between Paragraphs of Motion versus Phonetics of Motion, you need only flip to the back of the book.My complaints about this book are few--namely, lack of an index, and the glaring omission of the Family Tree Chart, which was mentioned specifically, but never included in the book. Other than that, I highly recommend this book to practitioners of American Kenpo specifically, as well as practitioners of any of the "traditional" striking arts. Ed Parker was a thinking matrial artist who put his ideas concerning martial arts practice down in a specific way so that others could understand and build on his work. Whether one practices his style of kenpo or not, the principles are worth considering and this book is worth reading.Chapters in Volume One: Mental Stimulation include:1. Introduction2. History of American Kenpo3. Three Divisions of the art (Basics, Self-Defense, Freestyle)4. Relationship of Martial arts Systems5. The Art as Related to Daily Living6. Ingredients, Stages, and Plateaus of Learning7. Philosophical Attainment8. My Philosophy of the Martial Arts9. Formalities and Rituals (verbal respect, Physical gestures of respect--Parker himself demonstrates the Kenpo Salute)10. Belt Ranking System11. Preparatory Considerations (Acceptance, Environmental Awareness, Range, Position, Maneuvers, Targets, Natural Weapons, Natural Defenses12. Stories of Related Value (Time and Place, Modern Day Ethics)13 The Ten Commandments of Prevention14 ConclusionGlossary of Terminology

Ed Parker introduces the literal foundation of American Kenpo with this volume, the second in a series of five. Parker revolutionized "traditional" martial arts by trying to explain them via a developed scientific method. In his introduction, Parker states:"Breaking the bonds of tradition has truly enriched my understanding of Martial Arts. It has given me insight that others have not been able to perceive." (page 2)This volume contains Ed Parker's continuation of the history of American Kenpo, which discusses the further development of the tournament scene, martial arts in Hollywood, and especially the expansion of tournament karate in the United States. The rest of the book focuses upon the importance of physical preparedness, including explanations of how muscled work, agility, etc. and a section on warm ups.This is followed by a detailed explanation of basics, how they are learned, applied, and may be arranged for application. Parker introduces here several American Kenpo theories which he completely explains--including the two "rearrangement concepts" (Numerical and alphabetical).Also included is one of the most complete treatises I've ever read on stances. Along with the variety of named stances comes instruction on how to properly find your distancing and correct your own posture. This is followed by a section called "Maneuvers", which details every manner of closing, evasive effort, or locomotion one might consider during exercise or an attack. I can't think of a more basic foundation than stance and movement, or a better written treatment on these specific subjects. Parker has been very thorough and considerate in his treatment of the material. Chapters include:*Acknowledgements/Dedication/Creed/About the Creed/Preface1. Introduction2. History of American Kenpo (continued from Volume 1): Ed Parker's Kenpo Association3. Physical Preparedness4. Basics5. Division of the Basics (Organizational chart on basics)6. Stances (Org. Chart, Attention Stance, Horse Stance, Bow & Arrow Stance, kneel stance, twist stance, cat stance, one leg stance)7. Maneuvers (org. chart, org. chart on foot maneuvers, foot maneuvers, org. chart on body maneuvers, body maneuvers8. Conclusion (Don't Quit)Glossary of TerminologyThere are a few mistakes scattered here and there, for instance application of the Numerical rearrangement concept is said to be demonstrated on page 37 when it is acttually 39...little technical mstake that wouldn't confuse anyone actualy reading the book through from the start. Again my peeve with this series: no index. Small faults for such a detailed offering which is obviously the product of so much time, effort, and serious thought.

This is the fifth and final volume in Ed Parker's technical series on "Infinite Insights into Kenpo". Parker described the first three books as the "How" of American Kenpo, the fourth volume as the "What", and this final book in the series as the "Why"."Mental and Physical Applications" ties all of the principles from the preceeding four volumes together and shows how the materials may be taught as a single curriculum. Parker focuses on how to learn, and how to teach, explaining that the two processes generally accompany and enhance one another (the teacher Parker points out, is still learning while he teaches). Using the original model explained in the first volume of Forms, Self-Defence and Freestyle, Parker offers a complete treatment concerning principles and theories of American Kenpo.Parker again stresses the importance of basics, physical and theoretical, and offers a comparison between basic rules for writing and those for efficient smart fighting. In making a comparison most of us can relate to, Parker gets the point across that fighting may be based upon sense and logic.For the first time, kenpo forms are explained as basics in motion, and the first three forms are presented here as well. Short Form 1, Long Form 1, and Short Form 2. Parker explains the purpose and principles of forms, and stresses the importance of the teacher's ability to convey the meaning and application of the form to the student.Parker introduces the Priorities of Self-Defense Study, tying together 12 important Priorities he has discussed in the preceeding four volumes of the series: Environment, Range, Position & Foot and Hand Positions, Stances, Maneuvers, Targets, Zone Theories, Natural weapons, Natural Defenses, Breathing, Tailoring, and Physical and Mental Conditioning.From here we go to studying the nature of an attack, and Parker introduces a learning tool called the "Web of Knowledge". He explains how knowlege is listed on the "Web", and how it insures students are learning the appropriate number of techniques with variant responses and principles. Parker shows 11 webs which illustrate the knowledge from various teaching and technical groupings required for promotion to yellow, orange, purple, blue, green, brown 3, 2 & 1, and black 1, 2, & 3.Parker also offers an analytical study of motion complete with illustrations, examples, and a helpful organizational chart. An important chapter on determining choice of action is includes, and an in-depth treatment of self defense techniques. Parker reminds us:"Because kenpo is an eclectic fightnig science it accepts, adopts and applies other scientific disciplines to maximize its effectiveness. Knowledge of anatomy, physiology and geometry are logically entwined to insure practicality" (101)Again the techniques shown in this chapter are for the purpose of illustrating American Kenpo principles, not for actually teaching the technique. It is clear Parker is speaking to an audience who already knows or is learning these sequences or similar ones from other styles. Parker shows 10 techniques to convey his points, including "Lone Kimono", "Crossed Twigs", "Five Swords", "Entwined Maces", "Detour from Doom", "Dance of Darkness", "Grip of Death", "Obstructing the Storm", "Raining Lance", and "Capturing the Rod". Each technique is not only fully illustrated, but includes detailed noted on technique as well as theory and all of the principles which the properly executed technique use. In the next section, Parker offers the same detailed treatment of Freestyle (sparring, competition). Chapters include:*Acknowledgements/Dedication/Black Belt Pledge/Abuot Pledge/Preface1. Introduction2. Importance of Basics3. Basics in Motion (Short Form 1, Long Form 1, Short Form 2: what they contain and teach)4. Priorities of Self Defense (Environment, Range, Position & Foot & Hand Position, Stances, Maneuvers, Targets, Zone Theories, Natural Weapons, Natural Defenses, Breathing, Tayloring, Physical and Mental Conditioning)5. Nature of the Attack (Web of Knowledge, How to read the Web of Knowledge, Web of Knowledge for belt requirements)6. An Analytical Study of Motion (org. chart)7. Determining Your Choice of Action8. Self Defense Techniques (Benefits and pointers, reinforcing ingerdients speed/power, selected techniques (10)9. Freestyle (Sparrnig) (acceptance, Environment, Range Dimensional stages of action, Position, Positioned blocks, zone theories, reactionary postures and positions, maneuvers, foot/body/feinting, targets, postures & positions in relation to targets, contouring principles, complementary angle, angle of incidence, surface concentration, penetration, natural weapons: strikes, natural defenses: blocks, Mental and Physical Constituents: a review of contributing factors, freestyle techniques, explanation of freestyle techniques, notes on freestyle techniques)10. ConclusionSuccess*Glossary of TerminologyA well-preseted series which progresses in a logical order. After reading and considering this series, I believe Parker accomplished what he set out to do. He presented his materials, principles and theories in a sensible down-to-earth way. You needn't be a student of American Kenpo to glean useful information from this series, although I wouldn't reccomend any serious student of Parker's American Kenpo (or derivatives) go without. I found this series of books useful in helping me adapt the way I consider attack and defense, even though my own style of preference is Okinawan Karate. Clearly this was the product of much serious thought and hard work. I'm proud that a fellow American martial artist could contribute something truely noteable and new to the world of martial arts.

This is the original English language BIG Tang Soo Do Book. Tang Soo Do is one of the terms used to describe the modern Korean fighting art containing elements of Native Korean Taek Kyun (most noticeable in the kicking techniques), and Japanese Karate (evident in stance, punching, and Hyung/forms). Older first print editions of this book have Black dustcovers with the title "Tang Soo Do (Soo Bahk Do)" and a picture of two men, one demonstrating a flying side kick, the other preparing to evade it. Later editions have a dark blue cover with the Moo Duk Kwan logo and the title "Soo Bahk Do (Tang Soo Do)". Both books have the same content.Author Hwang Kee was the founder of the Moo Duk Kwan school, one of 9 original Kwan or schools of martial art influenced by Japanese Karate and established in Korea during and just after World War II. Hwang's book is still noteable as it was the first volume to reprint entirely the older military empty-hand fighting arts book "Moo Yei Do Bo Tong Ji". Although Hwang does not offer a complete translation in either this English work or his Korean books, at last people have the opportunity to see one of the sources of inspiration for Korean martial artists who were looking for native sources outside the scope of Japanese martial arts to minimize the shame many felt after the terrible period of oppression Koreans suffered at the hands of Imperial Japan.The section on history is honest although by our standards dated. Hwang mentions the relation between Okinawan and Japanese Karate, and early Korean Tang Soo Do and Tae Kwon Do. Unlike later leaders authors who endeavored to hide the fact of this relationship by offering up phony revisionist histories, Hwang even credits the Hyung practiced in Moo Duk Kwan Tang Soo Do to their appropriate teachers, at least as far as was known in his age. Readers will find some of the phonetic translations differ in spelling from what we are used to...Okinawa's Itosu is referred to as "Mr. Idos" (pg 20,372), Higasionna is really not that far off from Higashionna (p 20), and Funakoshi is referred to as Humakoshy (20), simple phonetic differences due to the lack of an "f" sound in the Korean dialect.There are decent sections on Philosophy, History, Practical study (one would be better served to get anything by Martina Sprague to understand physics and martial arts), Application of technique to include Stances, Principles of Basic Movement covering hand and foot techniques, and a section on Forms, or Hyung which includes the 9 basic forms most schools utilize for promotion to Cho-dan (first degree Dark Blue or Black belt) or Cho-dan Bo (candidate for first degree). Forms include the three original basic Ki Cho Hyung Ill-Bu, Ee-Bu & Sam-Bu, and the five intermediate Pyung Ahn forms, Cho-dan, Ee-dan, sam-dan, Sa-dan, and Oh-dan, and also Bassai hyung.Many of the forms and techniques are demonstrated by Hwang Kee's Son, Hwang Hyun-chul. Later editions of this book have been reprinted by the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation. Also available are a series of four learning books with gup-belt specific material in them, including required self defense and sparring sequences, vocabulary, and hyung (including the newer hyung created by Grandmaster Hwang not covered in this book such as the Chil Sun, Yuk Ro, and Hwa Rang series). USSBDMDKF has also published a worthwhile book discussing the history of Kwan founder Hwang Kee, and a second book on Dan-level hyung.There are also a number of fair books by other notable Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan practitioners which are similar in structure to this volume. Students of those teachers will undoubtedly be encouraged to purchase their teacher's works. But don't lose sight of the man who started the Moo Duk Kwan in the first place! He is present throughout this book.

Be advised there are no pictures in this book, it is an academic undertaking. If you are looking for something with visual historical material in it, try the two books authored by Mark Wiley: &quot;Filipino Martial Culture&quot; and &quot;Filipino Fighting Arts: Theory and Practice&quot;.The placment of Mark Wiley's name on the front cover suggests he is the AUTHOR, where he is in fact, the EDITOR of this collection of articles (he is also a contributor). Not Wiley's fault--he credits the collective group in the introduction. Small point that only matters to us fans of footnotes, I know...now, on to assessing this collection of articles!In Part 1, writers offer perspectives on the origins of the Filipino arts, including five articles such as &quot;A Question of origins&quot;, by Felipe Jocano, Jr., and &quot;Questioning the Origins of Escrima&quot;, by Dr. Ned Nepangue, etc.. Part 2 focuses on Historical Perspectives with five offerings like &quot;A History of Eskrima in Cebu and Negros&quot;, by Krishna Godhania. Part 3, Cultural Perspectives, includes eight articles by different contributors, including &quot;Passion from the Crescent Moon&quot; by Marilitz Dizon, and &quot;The Making of the Batangas (Balisong) Knife&quot; by Dr. Jopet Laraya. Part 4, Facing The Future, includes three articles including Combative vs. Competitive Escrima by Krishna Godhania, and &quot;The Implimentation of Arnis in the Physical Education programs of Tertiary Schools in Cebu City&quot; by Abner G. Pasa.Overall, this is a good collection of topics of a calibre more advanced than most newsstand martial arts magazines could tolerate. The tone is clearly academic in nature, although less than half of the article include notes of some sort at their conclusion. Wiley does include a well-rounded list of source materials for further reading. If you are tired of how-to manuals, here is a book which will present new information, even for those of us who have pretty well &quot;been around the block&quot; when it comes to learning about other cultures and practice. The variety of perspectives are insightful.

But the text isn't bad either. This is a smaller sized book, only about 5 by 7 inches, slightly larger than standard paperback size. The author has written a modern personal Tao Te Ching. Uplifting brief paragraphs acompany vivid and colorful prints from China and Japan.This little volume offers an opportunity to take a short jaunt away from the usual humdrum. It's perfect for next to the computer (while waiting for things to download), waiting in line at the post office, or on top of the toilet tank (you need an explanation?).

Apparently some of the other reviewers and whomever posted the illustration above have confused this book with the "New Jerusalem Bible". Please be advised that this is NOT the "New Jerusalem Bible", but a detailed Hebrew text with English translation of Tanakh, the complete Jewish Scripture. This Hebrew/English edition was revised and edited by Harold Fisch, and offered by Koren Publishers of Jerusalem. I found it to be a good frills-free text and translation, devoid of commentary and interpretation from outside sources.There are three sections that make up this Tanakh: Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, & the 12 Minor Prophets), and Holy Writings (Psalms, proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles). Often these three sections have been published separately from one another, it is nice to have all three together in one volume for easy reference and reading.Likewise, I found the English translation very readable and without pretense. I appreciate the fact that the title of each book is shown in Hebrew, English, and then the correct Hebrew pronounciation in English. The proper Hebrew pronounciations are used throughout the English translation: 'Moshe' for 'Moses', 'Yisroel' instead of 'Israel', 'Yehoshua' in the stead of 'Joshua', and so on. Having the Hebrew right there on the opposite page also makes it easy for me to compare and follow along in either language. I found this book to be a good tool in practicing my Hebrew reading as well as furthering my understanding of the language.

I had such mixed feelings when I heard a film was being made about one of the September 11th 2001 crashes. Someone was making a film about United Flight 93, the plane that had been forced into a nosedive in a Pennsylvania field by a fundamentalist terrorist, killing all aboard. Had it really been almost five years? Was America ready for this? Was I?! I debated the ethics of making a movie--and of my going to see it. So many of the things in our lives are already edited and distilled down to 2 hours. I'd been trying to forget about this.But Flight 93 shouldn't be forgotten. Too much changed on that day. My bubble broke, the world came pouring in. Always so eager to be united in Freedom and Liberty, we Americans were all bound in sorrow. So, when the film opened a few days ago in my town, I went. I watched, knowing if I thought it was exploitative or over the top, I could always tell others to pass.As a skeptic always on the alert for the Big Rip Off, I didn't see anything that reeked of profiting off the victims or trying to edit a tragic event down to a 2-hour "special". I was surprised to find that part of the profits go to a fund for surviving family members of crew and passengers who died that day. There are no easy answers in this film.The passengers, crew, air traffic controllers, officials, families of passengers and crew on Flight 93 are portrayed with dignity. The difficult task of portraying the terrorists, full of hatred for the society in which they'd lived for years and months was sobering and well acted. It appears that the director went through serious lengths to make this appear as true to fact as the actual events happened, and to try to keep things realistic without overdramatizing or allowing (bad) overacting. No mean feat as the only records there are to give an idea of exactly what happened on Flight 93 are the recollections of people who received calls from some of those aboard Flight 93, partial recordings from cell phones, air fones, recorded radio and the data recorder information. The situations shown are plausable and based on existant evidence.If you remember that day, it will be emotionally draining (I know, duh). You'll remember where you were, what you were doing. You will wish you could somehow get up there onscreen and help. It is natural and easy to empathize with these people, they were ours. The passengers and crew are a cross section of America--common folks like us, on their way to somewhere. This is a tribute to ingenuity, fighting spirit, and human decency. A not so subtle reminder on the rigors of vigilance.Loud moments, violence, profanity, otherwise scary stuff, so use your good judgement if bringing (preferably older) children.

I have no doubt about the author's sincerity in offering this personal interpretation of Musashi's original work, &quot;Book of 5 Spheres&quot; (or &quot;The Book of 5 Rings&quot;). The problem I have with what Stephen Kaufman has done to Musashi's book deals more with his implied suggestion that this edition is the result of an actual ~translation~ which he was responsible for (see pages xi-xii, &quot;Translator's Note&quot;). In fact, when asked Mr. Kaufman has admitted that this volume (and some others he has written) are not translations at all, but rather his own personal interpretations of English translations done by other authors--something he DOESN'T bother to communicate to his readers. The title of this volume, at odds with the &quot;translator's note&quot; on pgs xi -xii, is actually &quot;...The Definitive _Interpretation_ of Miyamoto Musashi's Classic Book of Strategy&quot;. I fail to understand why Kaufman confuses his readers by mixing and matching interpretation with translation. It should be noted that Mr Kaufman himself does NOT speak or read Japanese, and in fact innocently named his own martial arts school &quot;Dojo no Hebi&quot; (&quot;Place of Practice's Snake&quot;), when he was trying for &quot;Dojo of the Snake&quot; (which in Japanese would have been &quot;Hebi no Dojo&quot;, meaning &quot;The Snake's Place of Practice&quot;). Innocent mistakes yes, but one would expect a Black belt of the 10th Dan (degree grade) and a proclaimed &quot;Hanshi&quot; (master practitioner) to at least check his spelling with someone who _could_ speak the language he was using.Kaufman doesn't bother to provide a bibliography of which English translations he used, nor does he include notes explaining how he drew his conclusions from the texts he studied. I am bothered by the fact that many of Musashi's words have been heavily edited, re-arranged, or deleted altogether by this author until they have been removed entirely from their original context. In doing this, Mr. Kaufman has actually ALTERED the _meaning_ of Musashi's work! What remains appears to be little more than a new age self-help guide for modern martial artists which has retained a smidgeon of flavor from Musashi's original work.A brief example illustrating Kaufman's tendancy to put his own words in Musashi's mouth is in the fourth paragraph on page 6 of Kaufman's book. Kaufman reworks Musashi's words regarding Merchants as a class to read, &quot;Merchants are a ridiculed class because they produce nothing except profit from the work of others.&quot; Two other men who have actually translated Musashi's work from the original Japanese suggest nothing sinister in Musashi's original work. Victor Harris in his translation of &quot;A Book of Five Rings&quot; offers: &quot;The way of the merchant is always to live by taking profit&quot; (page 41, 1974). Translator Thomas Cleary offers the same sentence as: &quot;Whatever the business, merchants make a living from the profits they earn acording to their particular status&quot; (page 7, 1993). This is a minor demonstration of the differences between Kaufman's work and those offered by actual translators--the translators make an effort to convey to the reader the actual meaning of Musashi's words in English, while Kaufman crafts a new meaning which never existed in Musashi's original work. Suffice to say, Kaufman's interpretation seems heavily influenced by his modern view of martial arts and his concept of what samurai may have been like four centuries ago. It bears little resemblance to competent translations of Musashi's writings.I recommend two excellent translations of Musashi's work which stay true to the original Japanese. The first is &quot;A Book of Five Rings&quot; translated by Victor Harris, a mechanical engineer and technical interpreter of Japanese language who not only practiced kendo (Japanese fencing), but studied this art in Japan for 3 years under Ito Kyoitsu at the Seijudo Dojo. A second recommendation is &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; by Thomas Cleary, another professional translator. Unlike Kaufman, I did not find translations by these men to be &quot;intellectual exercises in translating Japanese to English&quot; (pg xi). I found legitimate translations by competent translators who were clear and direct...I suspect most scholarly people, whether students of martial arts or not, will draw a similar conclusions upon comparing Kaufman's book to any actual translation.

Volume two picks up where the previous issue left off. Plenty of stories here to delight the curious, as featured Bruce Lee and James Yimm Lee interact with Kenpo's Ralph Castro, T.Y. Wong, Al Novak, Wally Jay, etc. While it is probably the name of Bruce Lee that will attract most readers, it is the story of James Yimm Lee that I have been following. The experiences of these men are intertwined as they search for understanding and mastery over themselves. These are the days before Bruce Lee's fame as a screen star, when James Yimm Lee Introduces Bruce Lee to bodybuilding, and Bruce teaches James the Sil Lim Tao form of Wing Chun Kung Fu. James teaches Bruce how to break bricks, and Bruce Lee brings James to a new level in Chi Sao. Bruce is fascinated with a method of breaking whereby James and his student Al Novak are able to break a specified brick out of a stack of many...Bruce wants to know how it is done, and James tells him. One third of the book deals with the effort to write and publish Bruce Lee's first book, "Chinese Gung-Fu: The Philosophical Art of Self-Defense".One of the faults of this series is that it is written as a long story. There are no footnotes, no bibliography or index at the back. This makes it awfully hard to use as a factual reference. Were there interviews done, and with whom? Who contributed to this book, is entirely based on the memories of James Yimm Lee's son, Greglon Lee? That aside, "The Dragon and The Tiger" series makes for an enjoyable read. More's the pity that so many of the pioneers of physical culture and martial arts from that era remain unknown and unheralded. Perhaps along with James Lee, someday we will have detailed accounts of (or by for those who are still with us) Al Novak, Lau Bun, T.Y. Wong, James Wing Woo and Paul Pung to keep Bruce company on our shelves.

Jim Shepard creates a believable state recently taken over by a violent totalitarian regime. The state could be just about anywhere, and sounds Mediterranean...Carribean...Eastern European...Central African...South American...East Asian... or perhaps Middle Eastern. Well, I suppose it could just about happen anywhere. It contains elements of all of the worst paranoid dictatorships of recent history: Communist purges, Fascist tortures, Nazi destructiveness, fundamentalist repeals of freedom and I-know-what-is best-4-U censorship. Add to this mix 15-year old Karel Roeder who lives with his unemployed and distant father.Karel could be a lot of 15-year old boys-to-men in any culture, still a child, coming to manhood slowly with no guidance. Seeking comfort and stability he's not frequently known, trying to be a man, trying to figure out his place in the world and his society. His interests are mainly the reptiles in the zoo where he is apprenticed to herpatologist Albert, and his childhood family friend and budding anti-regime activist Leda, on whom he is developing a serious crush.This tale follows Karel through the losses and destruction of the few things important to him. Very descriptive, a well told story, frightening in its starkness. Hints of the film "Brazil". Be afraid.

Do You Live In Dangerous Times? This is not a picture-by-picture how-to book, but a thick volume (394 pages) of sound advice for anyone who is intent on surviving attack in any form. Author Sockut's book is thin on photos, and BIG on common sense. Sockut presents case studies and examples, and then advice gleaned from the events in a series of "Street Survival Lessons". Rather than simply advising us that we can never be to careful, we learn this scenario after scenario.This volume emphasizes situations where an armed or unarmed individual meets up with an armed antagonizer, and breaks attackers down into categories by their weapon of preference, offering advice specific to each. Covered are bladed weapons (knife & sword), batons and clubs, and guns (short & long). You will learn what to watch for concerning suspects, how to guard against the unlikely, and how to stay focused. You will learn the best way to conceal weapons on your person, and how to be certain your weapons will be in working order when you need them.Recommended especially for anyone who works in law enforcement, corrections, in a capacity for the military, or other public service employees. A good companion to this is Rex Applegate's "Kill Or Get Killed".

Chalk up another terrific book published by Dragon Books. Morio Higaonna's work (translated by his wife, Alanna Higaonna) does for goju ryu karate what Shoshin Nagamine's book &quot;Tales of Okinawa's Great Masters&quot; has done for shorin-ryu karate. Finally the rest of us have access to the thoughts of the surviving (at the time of publication) old time karate men. Higaonna has gone out of his way to locate the men who studied under Kanryu Higaonna and his top student, the humble and skilled Chojun Miyagi.Higaonna relates the recollections of men like Seko Higa, Seisho Aniya, An'ich' Miyagi, Meitoku Yagi, Yoshimi (Gogen) Yamaguchi, Seiko Kina, Shichi Arakaki and many more. This volume is packed with valuable historic photos, and includes a number of tables which compare Okinawan, Fujian, and Mandarin names for forms and weapons. There is an appendix with a number of interesting referrences, including laws imposed upon Okinawa by the Satsuma clan after the Island came under japanese domination, and brief biographies of prominent figures whi influenced the development of Goju, such as White Crane Master Go Ken-ki. There is a glossary as well as an index. The only glaring error I found was in the index, where the names of Okinawan persons were cataloged by their first and not last names--evidently a computer error nobody caught.For anyone with a driving interest in Okinawa karate or general Okinawa history, this is an important volume which should not be neglected. What a pleasure to read! Higaonna's 4 volume series, &quot;Traditional Karate-Do: Okinawa Goju Ryu&quot; volumes 1-4 is also highly recommended for those seeking a perfect technical guide.

In an age where low quality has become the rule, Richard Chun's Book "Tae Kwon Do: The Korean Martial Art" is an exception. This was the first of the widely available large taekwondo books covering World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) style.Author Richard Chun himself is originally of the Moo Duk Kwan, and was part of the contingent which split from Grandmaster Hwang Kee to remain with the Korea Taekwondo Federation (later the World Taekwondo Federation). In observing and considering the techniques in this book, those who have experienced other martial arts will be able to see the "old" style of Taekwondo, with the wider stances and solidity reminiscent of Japanese karate.This volume contains the information required for the rank of Cho-Dan (first degree black belt) in most Taekwondo schools. Chapters cover history, stretching, strength exercises, stances, walking and moving, striking, vital points, hand, arm and head techniques, blocking, kicking techniques (including wheel kicks, jumping, and a technique I've never seen anywhere else--the handstand double foot kick!), advanced stances and combinations, sparring, self defense, breaking and special techniques, equipment in training, sport taekwondo (WTF style), and 9 forms: ki-cho 1, and the 8 Pal-Gwe.The volume is hardcover, with cloth-covered boards and dust jacket. The photographs are crisp and clear, the paper is quality acid resistant, and the binding is (gasp) sewn. This book really is a work of art and a fine tribute to the practice of Taekwondo as a martial art.

For years Korean stylists have heard about the Mu Ye Do Bo Tong Ji (MYDBTJ). FINALLY, we can not only see illustrations from the original woodcuts, but read a decent English translation of the work. Sang H. Kim has done more in the popular martial arts media (with the possible exception of He Yong Kimm) to explain Korean martial arts to the general public than anyone else. It says a lot that in the year 2000, someone (Kim) finally found it worthwhile to share the MYDBTJ with the folks who have heard so much about how it impacted the development of their martial art (tae kwon do, hapkido, etc).Compiled from a variety of (credited) Chinese military texts by court official Lee, Dok-mu, the MYDBTJ came into use in Korea during the year 1790, Yi Dynasty. This 400 page volume offers us an uncommon view of actual practical martial skill utilized in days past, and surprisingly for many of us, finally dispells the myth of the importance of empty handed fighting among warriors of days past. For with the exception of a single chapter (pg 311-332), the entire focus of this volume is upon drilling with weapons (sword, staff, pole weapons, polo, horsemanship, etc)! It is of interest to note that in this section, mention is made of sources that refer both to the Shaolin method and death point striking.For a truely excellent perspective on the MYDBTJ, a recommended read is the article "Korea's Mu Yei Do Bo Tong Ji: A Sample of Martial Arts training in the Yi Dynasty" by John Della Pia in _Journal of Asian Martial Arts_ Vol. 3 #2 (1994). I should also mention that although the MYDBTJ is compiled from CHINESE documents there are many people who in recent years have used the MYDBTJ as a guide in trying to re-create old-style "native" Korean martial arts, among them Hwang Kee of the Moo Duk Kwan, various Hapkido and taekwondo teachers and others in Korea who have created both empty handed and sword forms based upon their unique interpretations of the sequences contained in this manual. It is interesting to obsrve that virtually none of these independent interpretations agree with one another in form or application, suggesting that even folks with the benefit of growing up immersed in Korean language and culture have difficulty understanding this 210 year old work. This is due in part to vagueness of the illustrations and the terms used to describe the techniques, and the fact that it was originally written in classical Chinese. The terms include a vernacular which probably referred to commonly known techniques that needed no further explanation for an audience of 18 century soldiers. The unfortunate fact today is that native Korean martial arts with the exception of taek kyun (kicking), ssireum (wrestling), and archery have been lost to us as have the specifics concerning the skills shown in these manuals drawn from overwhealmingly Chinese sources. Unfortunately, nothing outside of Korea has been published on either Taek Kyun, Ssireum, or Korean archery.I highly recommend this volume to ANYONE engaged in martial arts practice (regardless of the nationalistic identity of your respective art). It will offer a unique historical perspective on pre-modern Asian military preparation and drill which is simply unavailable from other sources. You now have the opportunity to form your own opinions and draw your own conclusions from this fascinating historical document.

Here is this wonderful book in its enlarged format, VERY BIG and HEAVY! It is 11 inches by 8.5, and 1 1/4 inches thick! This book was originally put together by the Chinese government at Hunnan Province to educate people in small villages where there was no doctor or modern medicine available, hence "Barefoot Doctor".The book contains a complete explanation of acupuncture, including illustrations of therapeutic methods and charts. There is also information on basic first aid, including the herbs to give a person who is hurt. Over half of the book is an Encyclopedia of Chinese medicinal herbs, including detailed drawings, plant family, scientific name of plant, where it is found, how to gather, preserve, prepare and treat with the herb. Throughout the book there are herbal combinatons prescribed for a variety of ailments.This is a practical book meant to be used by average people, so there isn't a lot of high philosophy or complex metaphysical theory. Villagers and people in rural areas had to know things like how to identify dangerous snakes and treat venemous bites, what to do if a child broke a limb, how to treat grandma's bleeding ulcer, and so on. They often had to be able to do this without the aid of modern medicines most of us now take for granted, hence the practical focus on herbal medicine and acupuncture.This comprehensive volume was actually put together during a time in China when the Communist Party under Chairman Mao was trying to encourage self sufficiency among common people and do away with old superstition, so the advice is factual and practical and easy for any layman to understand. Medical conditions are descrbed in Western clinical terms, the translator Titus Yu has done an excellent job of making things easy to understand!I have found this book useful in understanding the practical basics of Chinese medicine, I found it a benefit that this book was not filled with theoretical fluff, but instead focused on sensible matters. This book was actually brought to the U.S.A. by a physician, Victor W. Sidel M.D., who had visited China. In 1974 the first edition of this book was released, it appears the publishers did everything right, including having an herbal consultant by the name of Lam Wah Bong go over the text and check for errors and understandability before it was printed. The text reads well and is easy to understand.I would recommend getting one of the original series of printings from the 1970's or 1980's. These editions include readable Chinese characters to accompany the herbs shown in the illustrations.

Fellow reviewer Shashank Tripathi did an excellent job of summarizing some of the more surprising truths about Gandhi explosed here in Richard Grenier's book, "The Gandhi Nobody Knows". There's no need for me to be redundant in repeating them all, but I would like to add a bit about author Richard Grenier and the book itself.A well-educated foreign correspondent, Richard Grenier was best known in later in his life for his work as a movie reviewer. This book was Grenier's response to and review of the Film "Gandhi", and originally appeared in the March 1983 issue of the neo-conservative American Jewish journal "Commentary". Grenier does a good job of explaining how the Indian government helped finace the film, and consequently reviewed and influenced the screenplay and the final product, adding "A friend of mine, highly sophisticated in political matters but innocent about film making, declared that "Gandhi" should be preceeded by the legend: [i]The following film is a paid political advertisement by the government of India[/i] (page 39).The picture Grenier presents of Gandhi as a person and leader is of a tumultuous character who was quite driven, but also contradictory and often totalitarian and unyeilding. Gandhi was certainly no great bulwark of anti-racism, and his later pacifism is colored by his volunteering to fight for the British Empire in South Africa against the Zulu during an uprising.Grenier also questions how the Gandhi of the British Empire evolved into the seemingly delusional man who wrote letters to Adolf Hitler during WWII, imploring him to recognize the brotherhood of humanity, and later suggesting that the Jews of Eurpoe could have died "more Significantly" had they simply committed suicide to protest Hitler's round up (thereby I suppose saving him the trouble and cost of having to do the work himself?!!).While Grenier is clearly uncomfortable with Hindu beliefs, he singles out Gandhi's pretexts for urging his later brand of pacifist anti-industrial Hindu beliefs on his fellow countrymen. Gandhi's preaching of "Ahimsa", or non-violence, was rather a fair weather deal. At times Gandhi supported violence, for instance during riots in Calcutta. Grenier reminds readers that even in nations with majority Christian populations, for practical reasons no government has taken the sermon on the mount as its governing document. Pacifism is simply not a practical device, and Gandhi's later idealism was apparently an outgrowth of his later personal religious views. Is pacfism idealistic? Yes. Is is practical? in many situation, no.The introduction to this 1983 book is by one-time b-movie producer and anti-abortion activist Franky A. Schaeffer, and dwells heavily on his belief that the Hindu religion is inferior to Christianity. Small surprise, as the publisher of this book is the well-known publisher of Christian religious and religion-themed books, Thomas Nelson. It fits the temper of the time, 1983, when the social conservative movement was beginning to gain momentum in the United States. That being out in the open, I didn't find enough overt bias on the part of author Richard Grenier to disqualify the facts he presents concerning Mahatma Gandhi as a leader, religious figure, husband and father.This book dashes the myth and takes a good look at the man. For anyone who would like a fuller, more acurate view of the whole Mahatma Gandhi as a human being, and not as a mythical icon, this book is recommended.

Ed Parker applies the genius of American Kenpo theory in this treatis of the Nunchaku. Parker deomnstrated basics such as stances and grips, to the importance of breathing, and the nunchaku as an extention of naturak American Kenpo weapons. An interesting blend between the traditional (Okinawan) and modern (American Kenpo). Parker's perspective tends to be practical--no fancy Bruce Lee moves to dazzle. Recommended for Kobudo stylists and employees of law enforcement agencies who utilize nunchaku.

Daniel Weng's "Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao" was the first book in English on this traditional Chinese method of wrestling (also spelled Shuai Jiao). Weng was a direct student of Chang Tung-sheng, famed practitioner and competitor as well as master teacher at the Police College in Taipei, Taiwan until his death in 1986.Included in the introductory section is a translation of the "Song of Shuai Chiao", also shown in Chinese calligraphy, as well a numerous photographs of Master Chang Tung-sheng demonstrating the art. There is a thorough section on history, including information on Chang Tung-sheng's teachers, training and lineage.The technical portion is illustrated with no-nonsense line ink drawings accompanied by very specific physical descriptions. While I think the drawings could have benefitted from the little drawn-in direction arrows one can so often see in works on Chinese martial arts, if you can read, you'll be o.k.! Most of the drawings are pretty self explanatory for anyone with about a year's experience in a grappling art such as wrestling, judo, jiu jitsu, etc.Sections covered include charicteristics & techniques, basic forms, applications of basic forms and throwing techniques, basic hand techniques and approaching gestures, grabs and breaks, training methods, falls, warm-ups, postscript. Included at the end are more photos of Master Chang giving demonstrations, with Daniel Weng and Gene Chicoine.Earlier editions give information on the International Shuai Chiao Association, while later editions refer to the demise of the aforementioned due to politics, and feature Weng's United States Shuai Chiao Association. Interesting and unique material!

This book sadly, is the only book written by James Yimm Lee which is still widely available to the public. Considered a classic, this was, unfortunately, James Yimm Lee's last book. James Lee was an avid student of physical culture as well as one of T.Y. Wong's Sil Lum students during the 1950's and early 1960's. He also befriended, influenced and was influenced by a young man by the name of Jun Fan "Bruce" Lee. In return for teaching Bruce how to break bricks, Bruce taught James a popular for of Chinese boxing called "Wing Chun". James Lee also helped Bruce publish his first book, "Chinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art of Self Defence" in the early 1960's.Still considered one of the finest introductions to Wing Chun, James Lee teaches Hong Kong's no-nonsense brand of boxing learned from his friend, Bruce Lee. As with all traditional Chinese Gung Fu schools, not every practitioner demonstrates the form precisely like every other practitioner, so no matter your school of Wing Chun (or Ving Tsun, Wing Tsun, etc), you will probably see SOME variation in form.While it may not be possible for the novice to learn precise movements from a book alone, the skilled martial artist may at least gain a better understanding of Wing Chun's patterns of movement. This book covers the basics of the art, including no-nonsense explanations for the theory of facing, and economy of movement. As usual, numerous crisp sequence photos from this publisher do not disappoint. Front and side views of the complete first form of Wing Chun, Sil Lum Tao (little idea form). This is the form Bruce Lee taught before he began to consider discontinue the use of static forms in training. A classic worth considering.

Here is a book I reccommend for ALL Itosu/Funakoshi lineage karate lineage people (Shotokan, Tang Soo Do, Chung Do Kwan, etc.). This version, published by kodansha, is an improvement over the edition put out by Master's publications with regard to the actual translation (I own and have read both, as well as the original Japanese version). It is also more affordable than the original hardback by Master's Publications, although the same company has since issued a paperback version, and I did not find the differences to be confusing throughout either work.As a historical work, this book offers a look at Funakoshi himself, who was the starting point for so many Japanese and Korean lineages, demonstrating kata and technique. This is not an in-depth study, and although all of 3 kata are shown in sequential photographs of Funakoshi (Pinan Sho-dan, Naihanchi, and Koshokun aka Kusanku), the other 13 kata only include 1 or 2 extra photographs and written descriptions...so if you are looking for a kata bible to refer to in your practice, you'd be better of with Nakayama's technically astute &quot;Best Karate&quot; series.For the era in which it was published, Funakoshi's work was truely an advancement, especially in that it was one of the (if not the) first karate books to include so many illustrative photographs as opposed to just drawings or written descriptions. Due to it's primative nature though, it is a less than complete guide for the beginner or anyone looking for perfect technical instruction. As a device to shed light on the origins of modern Shotokan and Tang Soo Do forms (and the like), to show the evolution of an art for the interested martial acholar this book is a must.

This book is not a physical instruction manual on the art of Ninjutsu--nor is it fiction. It IS an enjoyable journey into Bujinkan Taijutsu/Ninpo, conducted by the Grandmaster himself. Along for the ride are three of his seniormost non-Japanese students, Doron Navon of Israel, and Charles Daniels and Jack Hoban of the United States. This 100 page book is composed of three chapters. The first is in interview between Doron Navon and Hatsumi, the second between Jack Hoban and Hatsumi, and the third between Charles Daniels and Hatsumi. The value of these interviews lies in the fact that these three men in their experience ask questions most of us won't think about for another 10 years or so...and Grandmaster Hatsumi answers them! Includes pictures of Navon, Hoban, and Daniels as well an scarce pictures of Hatsumi with his ninpo teacher, Takamatsu Sensei.If you are looking for the essence of ninjutsu as a martial art, this is one of a handful of books which can offer some real insight to what the art is and what it means. Hatsumi discusses subjects which aren't covered in any other books, such as the skill of Akimoto, another student of his teacher, Takematsu (page 54-55). He clarifies many points, including the art he is teaching, saying: "I am, of course, teaching ninjutsu, but...the grades that are awarded all over the world are grades only in ninpo taijutsu". (page 71)This volume is an excellent companion to the volume authored by Hatsumi and his senior American student, Stephen Hayes which has recently been reprinted, "Ninja Secrets from the Grandmaster", which is also written in an interview format between teacher and student. If you're seeking to grasp what Bujinkan ninpo (taijutsu) is, books by Masaaki Hatsumi and Stephen Hayes are the most direct.

I can't recommend the books of James I. Wong strongly enough. This volume offers an extremely thorough explanation of the history of the Ta Sheng Pi Kua Men (Great Sage Monkey School), from its origins in other non-Shaolin Chinese styles to the present grandmaster of this specific school at the time of publication (1979). Wong explains characteristics of the style, including specoific schools which lead to the development of Ta Sheng Pi Kua Men, including style such as Pi Kua Men (Sage school) and Hou Chuan (monkey boxing). In depth considerations of the Monkey system, characteristics of different Monkey and monkey influenced schools and such. Includes a bibliography of sources (YAY!). Wong also includes a list of Chinese terms with their appropriate characters, perfect for those wishing to pick up some Chinese pertinent to the focus of study. This volume shows and explains two forms from the Ta Sheng Pi Kua Men school. They are: "Lu Wi Hsiao Mei Hua Chuan" (Small Plum Blossom Form), and "Er Mi Tsung Chuan" (Labyrynth, Lost track form). While the photos are nothing to write home about, they aren't terrible, and serve their purpose. You will be happy to know this volume and others by this publisher, Koinonia Productions, is back in print and available for around ten clams new. I recommend this volume and others by Wong to anyone who has an interest in the history of Wu-Shu (Kung Fu) styles. Wong is academic in his approach and treats his readers like the intelligent adults we are.

"White Crane Kung Fu Vol. 1: History & Forms" is another good Koinonia Productions book. You won't see a pretty glossy cover or spectacular photographs in this book...but you will learn plenty about the White crane style. Written by Ralph Caputo and James I Wong, This volume includes the White Crane school Plum Blossom Boxing form (Pai Hao Hsiao Mei Hua Chuan), and a condensed version of this form as well (different from plum boxing form in the Great Sage Monkey book). There is a history specific to NORTHERN white crane, which stands in contrast to the great focus placed upon Fujian (southern) crane boxing schools by Okinawa karate practitioners of late. As far as I have been able to ascertain, this is the only book on Northern White crane out there in English--this one. James I Wong's other books are recommended, and most can be obtained for about 10 clams or so from Leo Fong's private publishing company, Koinonia Productions. And in case you're wondering, there was only one volume in this series. Maybe Mr. Wong or his successor will grace us with more in the future? Happy Reading!

Yes, this is Hirokazu Kanazawa of Shotokan fame. In this book Kanazawa demonstrated the nunchaku, or Okinawan rice flail (some argure it was part of a horses bit harness, but that's neither here-nor-there). I believe this is the only book written on a Kobudo weapon by a Shotokan Karate purist.One of several traditional Kobudo weapons, the Nunchaku has long been a popular demonstration weapon. Kanazawa interestingly enough, demonstrates with a nunchaku held together with a chain, a' la Bruce Lee. His applications are for the most part traditional Kobudo (old-style weapons). This is NOT a traditionalist trying to cash in on a craze an looking like a fool. It is evident that the author has control and wields his weapon with precision in the photographs.This book is perfect for the weapons buff, or for the Japanese Karate traditionalist who would like to take up kobudo practice. The stances shown here follow suite with Shotokan and tend to be wider.Outside of Motokatsu Inoue's masterful works on kobudo, this is my favorite among English language nunchaku instructional texts. It is specific, the photos are clear and easy to understand, and the descriptions are a help. Like all the books I've seen that were published by Dragon books, a true work of quality.

Darnell Garcia began studying Karate in 1968 under none other than Chuck Norris. His lineage in the style of Moo Duk Kwan Tang Soo Do then, is Hwang Kee to Jae Chul Shin, to Chuck Norris! He is one of the few to have defeated none other than Joe Lewis in 1972, which won him the Grand Championship at Ed Parker's famed Long Beach Internationals that year. This book includes information up to about 2nd Gup (the first red or brown belt rank in most schools), including the first 8 Hyung common in most Moo Duk Kwan schools: the three Ki Cho Hyung (Il Bu, EE Bu, and Sam Bu) and all five of the Pyung Ahn Hyung (Cho Dan, Ee Dan, Sam Dan, Sa Dan, and Oh Dan).Garcia offers sensible advice on sparring, self defense, philosophy and forms. This volume is nice to have, but since its original publication in 1982, there have been published books which are more thorough in scope (I recommend Kang Uk Lee's "Tang Soo Do" for its affordability and depth, and Hwang Kee's "Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan" for its historical value). Why this book has been out of print is nother strange but true story of public record. Garcia became a DEA agent. Unfortunately he was involved in some illegal deals, fled the law, was captured, and eventually ended up convicted of 2 counts of money laundering, theft and distribution of heroin. Garcia was given what amounted to an 80-year sentance in 1991, later reduced to 41 years in 2003. Google "Darnell Garcia, DEA" for the facts & don't be misled by websites that don't post ALL of the trial documents. So this book is definately an interesting collector's item, although more recent works are definately more thorough in scope.

Paul Dong has written a number of books on the psychic phenomenon of the mind including "The Four Major Mysteries of Mainland China"(1984), and "China's Super Psychics" (1997). So he has been on the trail of the Supernatural for a while. This volume is an expanded and updated version of the book by the same title released in 1996 (139 pages). The format has been improved from the first edition, in my opinion.Most of this book is testimony from people who believe in or profit from teaching "Empty Force" (called "Ling Kong Jing" in Chinese) to others. Martial artists or other chi gong, nei jing (internal art) practitioners are testifying that they've seen or felt the effects of no-touch control, "jing" (power essence) eminating from others, been knocked down or out, knocked someone down or out or otherwise moved somebody or been moved by use of Empty Force. What this book completely lacks is a scintilla of valid scientific evidence for the existence of Empty Force.Mr. Dong seems to be of the mind that science has not yet disproven Empty Force. But when someone makes an extraordinary claim in the scientific community or among practical martial artists, it is normal for others to expect that individual to back it up with hard evidence. Left out of this book was the only known reliable double-blind experiment concerning Empty Force which tested Rich Mooney at George Mattson's Uechi Ryu Karate Seminar years ago. Subjects were separated by a partition from Mr. Mooney, and witnesses made certain that no secret signals or signs were given. Mr. Mooney failed miserably to influence a single subjects movement in the correct way--although a few of his _students_ moved in the direction _much different_ than that specified by the examiners! The favorite excuse after the failure to demonstrate any effect on volunteers including his own students was that the study was rigged--it wasn't. The results just weren't what Mooney and his supporters wanted. Nor has Mooney been willing to be tested again since.No new factual data or evidence, no experiments conducted in front of REPUTABLE scientists, especially those with a martial arts background, is presented here in Mr. Dong's new book. Mr Dong on the other hand is all too ready to accept anecdotal stories or testimonies as proof enough. As in his volume "China's Super Psychics", often it is enough that an act has mysteriously happened just at the instant observers (including Dong himself) have turned their heads. Would it REALLY be so bad to have legitimate tests of this purported phenomenon? I can't understand why practitioners are so fearful of the scientific community. If it is real, why be afraid of being tested?This edition includes numerous photos of Empty Force demonstrations, including still pictures of Mrs. Min Ou Yang You supposedly causing subjects to be lifted, do somersaults on the ground, and -offensive as it may be to some- otherwise causing loyal students to act the fool (Doc Fai Wong among others).In Robert W. Smith's "Chinese Boxing: Masters and Methods" (1974), Tai Chi Chuan Master Cheng Man-ching explained empty force to a young Tai Chi student who claimed her teacher had controlled her without physical contact. According to Cheng, "...the trick will not work against an equal or superior.", and the entire skill, "...depended on student awe, however, and would not work against a good boxer"(page 35). Apparently it only works on loyal students. Which again raises the practical question of its usefulness in the first place. As a showy diversion? To test a students loyalty? To feed the teacher's ego?Much like stage hypnotism though, Empty Force has its fans. Unfortunately it also has its true believers who don't appear to have considered the ethical implications of their chicanery on innocent students. Why the authors included "Self Defense" in the title of this volume, I do not know. Far from teaching any practical skills to their students, the people who promulgate these teachings are doing a vast disservice. I can only hope with all of my heart no-one actually attempts to use these..."skills" when the situation really counts for life or death. The results of trying to project Empty Force against an actual attacker in a real life situation could only spell disaster. It is difficult for any rational individual to conclude that Empty Force is little more than a con game, a potentially dangerous Empty Farce.

Fratkin has done an excelleny job of offering a guide to the sometimes murky realm of Chinese patented herbal compounds. This volume has helped me navigate the aisls of local herb shops and locate bone bruise medicine with the aid of the non-English speaking shop clerk. I especially like this guide because it includes a list of ingrediants, and shows what percentage of each herb, animal, or mineral is included.

I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone other than a dedicated International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) Instructor. It is indeed a beautiful set in 15 volumes, printed on high-quality paper, well bound. In many respects however, this series falls short.It is a technical encyclopedia for the most part dedicated to the execution of techniques done in the ITF way. A total of 8 of the 15 volumes focuses on the execution of ITF style Hyung (prearranged combative teaching forms, called kata in Japanese). The layout fast becomes mind numbingly annoying, showing a single huge photograph of each single technique in the hyung sequence on the left-hand page, then the lead up/denoumet on the opposing page along with a practical explanation. Does a center punch in a black belt form ~really~ need 2 accompanying photos showing the individual preforming the hyung punching an opponent in the abdomen to get the concept across? There is no summary of the hyung, no overview in thumbnail photos to convey the concept or character of the individual hyung to the student. Even for many dedicated ITF teachers out there, I have a feeling this will probably be just too much wasted space for the price.For the projected extent of this 15 volume series, I feel it could have included much more on history, better summaries, quality historic photos from General Choi's collection, and yes, even more of Choi Hong-hi's famed calligraphy. The layout could have been better, more content in the space provided would be my biggest request. As a Magnum Opus, a pinnicle masterpiece, it is just missing a whole lot of things that could have made it a non-pareil reference for martial artists of any style, let alone ITF practitioners, in ways other than extreme length and number of pages. Simply elongating and spreading out material without great elucidation just doesn't cut it.Recommended only for those who eat, breath and sleep ITF. For the rest of us I'd recommend the latest printing of Choi's abridged "Taekwon-Do: The Korean Art of Self Defence", a superb book which has essentially the same contents in condensed 700+ page form.

This volume is NOT a physical instructional manual. It is a dedicated examination of how Capoeira came to be, from the Continent of Africa from which the root of this combative art hied, to its development in Brazil.The author examines a variety of sources (which he lists). Rather than stopping at the usual cursory description of the original slaves imported to Brazil from Africa, Taylor provides documentary evidence concerning the existence, treatment, and conditions encountered by slaves imported to Brazil from Angola and other regions of Africa. Taylor's descriptions and historical references make the experiences of these peoples very real, and does more than any work I have read thus far to explain the spiritual, cultural and physical reasons behind the development and propegation of Capoeira, at once both a method of personal defense and strength training, and a physical mode of expression.For those with a dedicated interest in the history of Capoeira specifically, or anyone with an interest in the anthroplogical side of combative arts generally, this first volume in a planned two-volume set is a must. I look forward to reading a continuation of this history.

Author Tim Cartmell presents his translation of Tong Zhong-Yi's original 1935 book, "Chinese Wrestling Methods", obtained through Taiwanese publisher Lion Books. This historic work on the Chinese martial art of Shuai Jiao (sometimes spelled Shuai Chiao) includes all of the original photos showing Tong and his students demonstrating a variety of techniques.As a technical manual, this work details traditional training methods, balance, striking, how to obtain strength, walking properly, throwing, training with a partner, Shuai Jiao falling methods (different from Judo and most other arts), rules, and a complete history of the author Tong and the art are included. This book is a step back in time, offering a look at a martial discipline which has actually changed very little over the years, and should appeal to those with an interest in combative arts development and history. While some of the photos appear grainy, considering the age of the original I did not find this to detract from my ability to understand. What I do find surprising is the level of detail offered in an instructive book from 1935!Perhaps the most ironic thing about the release of this book is that while Shuai Jiao has been practiced in the United states for nearly 30 years, this is the most complete work in English to date covering the ~traditional~ aspects of Shuai Jiao training! Included in the beginning are nice portrait photos of Tong and other prominent Teachers and Coaches of Shuai Jiao. A group photo shows a number of sturdy looking Shuai Jiao men including one in the back row, fourth from left with his hands held separately in cleanched fists, rather than one hand clasping the wrist like the others...could this be a young Chang Tung-sheng?I found Cartmell's translation to be detailed and easy to understand. It is good to see so many martial artists in our present generation who have made an effort to understand the language and culture of the arts they practice. To be able to understand these practices in the context of their culture is a gift that enhances understanding for all of us. To Tim Cartmell, Thank You for sharing!

This is a description of the four-volume series by Goju Ryu Karate mavin Morio Higaonna. In it he details the complete Goju Ryu syllabus as passed down to his teachers, Ei'ichi Miyazato and Anichi Miyagi. Miyazato and A. Miyagi in turn learned directly from the founder of Goju Ryu Karate, Chojun Miyagi, a distinguished student of Kanryo Higaonna who learned martial arts in Fukien Province and also on Okinawa. This is simply the best series of books out there on Goju Ryu in any language! The photography is incredible, all techniques are shown with stop-motion photography, and there are many transitional photographs showing the complete execution of every technique. This series is the "bible" of Okinawan Goju Ryu Karate-do. I'm going to give you a break down by volume since all four seem to get put together here...Volume 1: Fundamental TechniquesHigaonna demonstrates Miyagi's original Junbi Undo (warm up), completely goes over all topics such as stances, traditional exercise routine with the chiishi (stone weights) shown in 187 photographs, Nigiri Game (gripping Jars) shown in 109 photographs, how to train on the Makiwara, how to construct a Makiwara, training with the Ishisashi (stone padlocks) is a sequence shown in 118 photographs, also covered are tan (barbell), tetsu geta (iron sandals), tou (bamboo bundle), jari bako (sand training), and an implement unique to Goju Ryu, the kongo ken. The depth with which all of these are explained and covered is phenomenal!Next is the section on fundamental technique with complete coverage of stance work, striking and kicking. Then a treatis on Kore-ate (2 man forearm training). For those who believe that all karate is stiff and unbending, this book may change your mind. There is a section on tai-sabaki (movement, and a special treat in the last chapter--the COMPLETE SANCHIN as passed down from Kanryo Higaonna to Chojun Miyagi to Anichi Miyagi to Morio Higaonna. This is the original turning Sanchin Kanryo Higaonna brought back from Fukien Province in China. Researchers believe this particular sanchin came either from White Crane style, or from Fujian Tiger Gung Fu. Morio Higaonna demonstrates the complete for in the traditional (for men at least) shirtless manner. 162 photographs with complete description illustrate this Foundational form of the Goju Ryu Karate School.Volume 2: Performances of the KataHigaonna goes over the charicteristics of Okinawan Goju-ryu, and then the demonstration of the first kata, the Chojun Miyagi Sanchin (different from the Kanryo Higaonna Sanchin in the first book). Included after this are in-depth renderings of kata Gekisai-dai Ichi, Gekisai-dai-ni, Saifa, Seiyunchin, Shisochin, and Sanseiru. Bunkai is shown separately in successive volumes....Volume 3: Applications of the Kata Part IOpens with an introductory note from Xing Yang-ling, Morio Higaonna on Bunkai, and then the remainder of the Goju Ryu Karate Kata syllabus: Sepai, Kururunfa, Sesan, Sanseiru, Suparinpei, and Miyagi's personal kata thought to have been influenced by Fukien Crane, Tensho Kata. This volume ends with the inclusion of the complete Bunkai (applications) for kata Gekisai-dai Ichi and Gekisai-dai Ni.Volume 4: Applications of the Kata Part IIContains the complete bunkai of Goju-ryu karate founder Miyagi Chojun for the 8 main kata of Goju: Saifa, Seiunchin, Shisochin, Sanseiru, Sepai, Kururunfa, Sesan, Suparinpei. Also includes sections on Iri Kumite, Shiai Kumite, and Yakusoku Kumite. Finishes off with Historical accounts of Kanryu Higaonna and Chojun Miyagi.A phenomenal series, the Karate World and Goju folks everywhere NEED this to be back in print again. Higaonna's effort is really in a class by itself.

This 60 page booklet is a collection of stories told by James Mitose to some of the men who studied theory with him while he was incarcerated for his involvement in a murder (Mitose is alleged to have encouraged a student, Terry Lee now known as Nimr Hassan, to have murdered an elderly couple from whom he was extorting money). The forward to this little volume is written by its editor, Dr. Arnold M. Golub, who explains that this volume was published posthumously as a tribute to Mitose.Those seeking an instruction manual on Kosho Shorei Kempo (James Masayoshi Mitose style) should be aware that this book contains no information on martial arts instruction. Nor is this an historical work, there are no photos or discussions other than the same brief introductory paragraphs included in Mitose's reprinted book "What is Self Defense?". This is a work of fiction, and there are some rather rudamentary illustrations which accompany the stories.Some of the tales are Mitose's retelling of popular Japanese myths, like the story of the "kendo" expert who tests his 3 sons by seeing how they respond to an object which falls upon them as they enter the room (page 4). Others seem written in such a way as to infer they contain true stories pertenent to the history of Mitose's Kosho Ryu Kempo, but are simply beyond the realm of belief despite being introduced as "true", as with Mitose's story of a Kosho Kempo master who entered the cage of an angry tiger who first shows agression, only to turn into a gentle big-kitty-cat when the master make the open-palmed Kiashu hand sign in its direction, affectionately rubbing itself against the master and licking his hand! There is a line of thought among some schools which have ressurected and (re?)constructed Mitose's Kosho Kempo that the teacher's greatest teachings were "hidden in plain sight". I suppose one could assign any interpretation they wanted to these stories. I did not find them particularely well written or morally compelling, but for someone who buys the official history of the Kosho style, I am certain this would be a volume to be treasured.

Includes an excellent introduction to this art detailing the history of Daito Ryu's founder, Takeda Sokaku and explaining the influences on him and also the lineage he passed his art on to, a chapter on Ueshiba Morihei founder of Aikido, a chapter on Gozo Shioda and the Yoshinkan, and then about 100 pages of techniques. As with other books written by Obata, excellent use of space, easy to understand, no confusion. As a matter of fact Obata includes a lot of information that is difficult to find anywhere else, often discussing the history of individual techniques! In one case, he even undertakes to reconstruct an unusual technique...One example is Obata's demonstration of Yama Arashi (mountain storm). Obata writes: "...this technique did in fact fall into disuse with the advent of modern Judo and was 'lost'....'Yama Arshi' was made famous by Shiro Saigo when he was fighting for the reputation of Kodokan Judo, against the older schools of Jiu Jitsu. No Judo man since has been able to perform this throw, and it seems it was never included in the curriculum of the Kodokan" (page 56-59)Toshishiro Obata covers the empty handed grappling of the Samurai as interpreted through Yoshinkan Aikido and Daito Ryu AIkijujutsu. These methods are closer to Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu and Yoshinkan Aikido than conventional Judo and Jiu Jitsu. These are fighting techniques that could cause damage to someone...none of the gentle methods and artistic considerations we're more familiar with in modern Aikido. Knowledge is power!

I first read Ibn Warraq's "Why I am not a Muslim" after discovering it in my university's library years ago. I neglected my studies for an entire day to read this fascinating book, it being the first dissenting view of Islam I had ever seen--and by a former Muslim no less.Two things make this book unique in a sea of other repetitive books about Islam, Prophet Muhammed, and the Quran. As many sects of Islam believe that apostates (people who renounce Islam as a religion) are fair game for assasination in God's name, Warraq has taken a very courageous step in these dangerous times by expressing his views in print. He backs up his points with solid referrences, the majority of these drawn from Muslim sources. Secondly, it should be pointed out that this is not a "conversion" book--the author seems to hold an agnostic world view, and while offering critical insight regarding Islam drawn from his own experiences as a former Muslim, displays no bias in favor of Christianity or Judaism. Ibn Warraq uses Islamic doctrine to tear down Islam, pointing out the many contradictions and ethical dilemmas that educated Muslims have been aware of (and often tried to resolve) for decades.Ibn Warraq includes a history of Islam as a religion to familiarize readers who know nothing about it. Chapters include topics such as the authoritarian nature of Islam, Mohammed's message, Influences and problems with the Koran, oppression of women in Islamic countries, and oppression (social, political, of other religions) as well. This volume includes a thorough bibliography and index.One point author Ibn Warraq communicates well is the incredible double standard whereby some Muslim nations decry lack of freedom for Muslims abroad, yet at home continue to allow (and often encourage) the persecution of non-Muslims. Without missing a beat, Warraq also demonstrates how Islamic doctrine has been used as a political tool by "Islamic" dictators and regimes to oppress...Muslims! Dissent among Muslims is rare. Historically, most dissenters didn't live too long...heck, today in Islamic nations most dissenters don't live long either--I suppose some things are slow to change.There is beauty in dissent, and the Highest and Noblest Blessing is Freedom. Do take the opportunity and read Ibn Warraq's interesting contribution.

This is actually the fourth in a series of books by John & Ruth Picard on antique trade beads. Essentially this volume is a 90-page descriptive catalog of Venitian Millifiore beads used for trade with Africa. Large format and measuring 8 1/2 by 11 inches ( or 21.5 by 28 cm), One of the most attractive and obvious peatures is that every bead is pictured in color and if known, details of the manufacturing process are provided! The Picards open by describing how these beads were made and defining some of the terms used throughout. Millifiore means "Thousand Flowers" in the Italian language, and indeed many of these beads seem to boast floral patterns. ALso included is a helpful article by Jamey Allen, "A Short History of Millifiore Work".Each one of these beads is a mini work of art, truely lovely to behold. If you are lucky enough to have some of these little treasures, or simply have an interest in glasswork and history, you will probably enjoy leafing through this work. Happy Beading :)

I found most of the information here has already published in other books on Okinawa Karate. While there isn't a whole lot here that an experienced Karateka will find new, the information has been arranged well, and ascends in an ordered fashion so that the reader can understand one theory in the light of others mentioned previously. Arakaki discusses principles common to most Okinawa styles, and offers advice on basic techniques. There is decent historical information, and photos of some of the old Okinawan masters which appear to have been &quot;borrowed&quot; from uncredited sources (many of the pictures show cross-grain which means they were taken from other printed sources).As with most Kodansha books, this volume is a work of top quality. The printing, photos, quality of the paper and binding is top-notch! This is a great book for beginners starting out in Shorin-ryu Okinawa Karate, especially those who practice the style of the author, Muso-kai Karate. For those with more experience, you're probably not going to see anything new here, and might be better served to consider Nagamine's &quot;The Essence of Okinawan Karate-Do&quot; for technical aspects, or Bishop's &quot;Okinawan Karate: Teachers, Styles, and Secret Techniques&quot; for history of various styles and the lineages of the various master teachers from &quot;way back when&quot;.

While fundementalist Muslims in Iran could silence Ali Dashti's voice and still his heart, they failed to supress his words. Dashti evidently put a lot of careful heartfelt thought into his volume "Twenty Three Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammed". If you've become dreary and nauseated from reading inflated proselytizing puff pieces on the life of Mohammed, founder of the Islamic religion, then what a treat this book will be! Dashti is cautious and considerate in his handling of issues touchy within the sphere of Shi'ia Islam. He is clear in communicating whether something is from a specific source, opinion, or theory.With this volume, Dashti took the courageous step of looking at Mohammed as a human: capable of mistakes, capable of anger, capable of being unjust, as are any of us. This perhaps, is what kindled so great a rage in the men who imprisoned him and tried to obliterate his words. I wouldn't call Dashti anti-Islamic, for I found nothing suggesting he was trying to destroy Islam, not a speck of evidence that he was trying to promote Atheism in the stead of religion. However, I am not surprised that unreasonable forces who disagreed with his point of view felt so threatened by his words. It can be a dangerous task, sorting out the facts--especially if those facts disagree with popular opinion, or the version supported by people who are more powerful and can make your life tough. Or take your life away.Make a fundamentalists eyes bug out, make an Ayatollah's face turn red--buy and READ Ali Dashti's book. Keep the idea alive and appreciate the freedom to have ideas that are forbidden to so many others.

Shoshin Nagamine's book is invaluable to anyone who studies Shorin-ryu Karate, or a school related to or derived from Shorin-ryu. Although Nagamine's volume was originally published in English in 1976, it still sets the standard for other books on the subject of Okinawan karate (I don't know of any English volume as thorough--and I own over 3,000 martial arts books). It is also the only English language Shorin-ryu manual to include complete demonstrations of ALL 18 kata of this style, all of which are demonstrated by Mr. Nagamine himself (photos, foot position &amp; stepping diagrams, and narrative). They include: Fugyu Kata I &amp; II, Pinan 1 through 5, Naihanchi 1-3, Ananku, Wankan, Rohai, Wanshu, Passai, Gojushiho, Chinto, and Kusanku. Practitioners of styles such as Shotokan and Tang Soo Do will enjoy comparing these older versions of the forms with those they practice today. This is one of the few books on Karate which could benefit a practitioner at either the basic OR advanced levels, due to the amount and depth of information included within.Another attractive feature of this book is the excellent autobiography which Mr. Nagamine includes. He writes about personal aspects of his life, his interest in karate and other martial arts (he was also a skilled judoka), and includes a subsection on each of his teachers describing his experience and what he learned. He describes training with his first teacher, Ankichi Arakaki, and then the famed Chotoku Kyan, and the kempo master Choki Motobu. Nagamine offers his personal thoughts on karate training, including a series of precepts which have guided his own studies. The section on basic techniques (preceeding the lengthy section on kata) shows exactly how each movement is to be performed, and includes detailed photographs from the start of the technique to its finish. There are also sections on Kumite (showing 7 sequences and also brief information on breaking objects and makiwara training) and Kobudo (weapons such as sai, bo, nunchaku, etc.).Concerning Shishin Nagamine, the man was a dedicated karate researcher as well as a skilled practitioner who knew many of the old masters and was friendly with karate men of other styles. Nagamine's specific style is called Matsubayashi Shorin-ryu. He was a policeman by trade, and has written a second book called &quot;Tales of Okinawa's Great Masters&quot;, which includes much more about his experiences delving into karate history.

An incredibly enthralling look at the relationship between two of the most influential martial artists of the 20th century. One now a well-known icon (Bruce Jun Fan Lee), the other just coming into his due (James Yimm Lee). For the first time, in this extensive work we can read about the symbiotic relationship between Bruce Lee and James Yimm Lee (not blood related to one another despite the last name). The book is helped immensely through the participation of Greglon Yimm Lee, James Lee's son, who offers insight into the life of his father and family life previously unknown.Largely forgotten, or formerly summed up in a few brief paragraphs, James Lee wrote and published the first publicly available serious gung fu books in English. James Lee was a consummate martial artist in his own right, having studied at one of the first public Sil Lum (Shao-Lin) schools in San Francisco (under T.Y. Wong), as well as making it a practice to trade techniques and practice with other martial artists throughout the Bay area. Another famed student of James Lee's covered in this book is Al Novak, a pioneer in his own right.James Lee was one of the first martial arts men to advocate the practical approach through his books, keeping useful information, and rejecting the notion of maintaining &quot;tradition for tradition's sake.&quot; As a matter of fact, if you compare any of J.Y. Lee's early self-published books, you can see the progression J.Y. Lee made from blind obedience to tradition, to creating his own practical tradition. Of course, most of us don't have access to these books--which is what makes this volume, &quot;The Dragon and the Tiger&quot;, a treasure.There are photos and explanations of James Lee's early books, training devices, and classes--and the full story of how Bruce Lee came to adopt many of James Lee's theories and methods. It isn't difficult to see how James Lee's concepts became popularized by Bruce Lee, who adapted many of James Lee's methods to his own needs (as James Lee had intended). Bruce Lee of course, later became legendary for his own practical approach, which was later systematized in his Jun Fan Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do, influencing contemporary martial arts thought in the U.S. and the World.This is a book about friendship. About a journey into study and research and human limits that two men undertook together. It provides new information not contained in any other work which makes for an enjoyable read and a hard-to-set-down book. Finally, a book that gives credit where it is due--to James Yimm Lee: teacher, student, and argueably perhaps the greatest influence upon Bruce Lee. You needn't be a Bruce Lee fan to enjoy this book, anyone with an interest in American martial arts history, the Chinese community in America, or American history in general should find this fascinating.

In this little green volume, Un presents some of the basics of Praying Mantis Kung Fu, including a decent section on the history of the style through his lineage. The form Bong Po is demonstrated, and the major complain I have with the book is that Author Un wears a dark uniform against a dark background, which makes some of the first pictures in this form difficult to understand for a beginner or anyone who is trying to learn this form solely from this book. There is also a section at the rear of the book showing applications from the Bong Po set. Altogether it is not a bad book for its size.

Old School cinnamon toothpics in bulk quantity, Yay! The concept is simple but effective--These are made of a wood slightly softer (and much more absorbant) than the regular plain boxes of round toothpicks, and soaked in STRONG cinnamon oil. The resulting flavor is VERY strong cinnamon often resulting in numb tongue/lips, DO NOT confuse these with those wimpy so-called "flavored" round toothpicks passed out in fancy-schmancy resteraunts.We used to buy these at the liquor store across from school in 5-piece packs (I lived in a terrific neighborhood). I vividly remember chewing on these in High School during certain classes to stay awake. For some reason, a toothpick was tolerated where gum or a tootsie pop was not. The flavor was so good (STRONG) for so long, I would often end up chewing these things to a nice, woody pulp. MMMmmm! Against my nature, I am going to resist commenting on cinnamon toothpicks as a source of dietary fiber. For those saddled with droning teachers or co-workers, know that it is simply not possible to fall asleep with something as hot as these toothpicks in your mouth. In college, I found them useful in finally breaking my nail biting habit. Wood pulp, thankfully, is non-addictive. Offer one to a non-suspecting friend and watch their eyes light up along with their tongue! :)

If you already have Mark Tedeschi's Huge 1136-page Hapkido book, you're probably wondering what makes this volume on throwing techniques any different. The main difference is this: The big Hapkido book ~does~ include every technique shown here. However the detail in this volume is much more exact--the big Hapkido book was so inclusive that the author was limited to showing 2-3 photos to illustrate a hold or throw. This volume on Throws uses an average of 5-9 photographs per technique, including close-ups. The descriptive narrative is also more specific in this volume. So if you would like a volume which is incredibly specific on the subject of throwing techniques, this book is the thing! If you already have the big book, and don't really need the extra detail, then this volume will probably be redundant.Tedeschi has grouped the techniqes into six major categories: shoulder Throws (12 techniques), hip throws (14 techniques), Leg throws (12 techniques), Hand Throws (26 techniques), Sacrefice Throws (10 techniques)Kick-counter throws (16). Also a set of 20 combinations (throw to lock), and a vital section on Defenses against throws (24 defenses shown). You might also be wondering whether the techniques shown in this book are too specific to Hapkido to be of any use to you if you practice say, judo or another martial art. The nice thing about Tedeschi's books is that he has studied a variety of grappling arts--and come to the same realization the rest of us have over the years. An inside shoulder throw is still an inside shoulder throw--whether you call it that in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, or English. Tedeschi's 4-volume series makes no distinction as to language or culture--every technique in this book is referred to by it's English name.I should add that I am pleased with the quality of the volumes put out by the publisher, Weatherhill. Clear photographs are printed on slick acid-resistant paper, and the boards of these volumes are covered with a laminated paper that will resist picking up sweat (or any other of those wonderful things we get on our books while taking them on the mat or discussing techniques after practice). Tedeschi has gone the extra mile in making ALL of his books as specific as possible. Most of the techniques shown include extra photographs and diagrams of bones, muscles, and pressure points as they apply to the specific technique. This is the first technical martial arts book by any author where I've seen this sort of exacting detail on virtually every technique. And to think, he doesn't call himself Grandmaster or wear anything but a plain black belt.

If you already have Mark Tedeschi's Huge 1136-page Hapkido book, you're probably wondering what makes this volume on holds any different. The main difference is this: The big Hapkido book _does_ include every technique shown here.

This volume on holds uses an average of 5-9 photographs per technique, including close-ups. The descriptive narrative is also more specific in this volume. So if you would like a volume which is incredibly specific on the subject of holds and locks, this book is the thing! If you already have the big book, and don't really need the extra detail, then this volume would probably be redundant.I should add that I am pleased with the quality of the volumes put out by the publisher, Weatherhill. Clear photographs are printed on slick acid-resistant paper, and the boards of these volumes are covered with a laminated paper that will resist picking up sweat (or any other of those wonderful things we get on our books while taking them on the mat or discussing techniques after practice). Tedeschi has gone the extra mile in making ALL of his books as specific as possible. Most of the techniques shown include extra photographs and diagrams of bones, muscles, and pressure points as they apply to the specific technique. For instance, the section on chokes and head locks includes 6 pictures of wrist action along with two diagrams of pressure points on the hands--and the explanation of why you align your wrist in a certain way, and how it is the most effective biomechanical method. This, similar photo-diagrams showing the difference between Basic Entries and Forced Entries, Eliminating free play in a choke, the importance of body positioning, types of chokes, major targets (again, several pictures naming areas with their pressure point location &amp; proper location name), and attack points--this is before he even begins to show and describe a variety of chokes!This specific volume includes an overview (history, types of holds, comparing holds from different martial arts, responsible use of force), then fundamentals (breakfalls, concepts, principles, stances, footwork, etc.), Wrist Locks (10 different), Arm Locks (16 of them!), shoulder locks (12), Finger Locks (18 kinds, 8 applications), leg locks (12), Chokes &amp; Head Locks (32), Nerve Holds (20), Defenses Against Chokes and Head Locks (10), and Defenses against Joint Locks (10). Tedeschi includes a complete bibliography of his sources.

On an unfamiliar and unfrequently considered subject, we have a treasure (and hopefully a beginning!) in this book. I'm familiar with authors Guo and Kennedy from their articles in "Classical Fighting Arts" magazine. Like their well-referenced articles, this book does not disappoint! Over the last 10 years, a change has been taking place in the martial arts community. Serious scholars and the academically minded have broken with old mainline publishers and proponents of what could be termed McDojos and McKwoons (the "fast-food" schools of martial arts) to delve deeply into the history, applications, science, and philosophy of combative arts new & old. As a result, we're witnessing the emergence of high caliber works such as this which not only challenge, but blow many popular martial arts myths out of the water. This volume was not written as a challenge, but as a survey of historical written materials concerning Chinese martial arts. Any debunking is purely incidental, really!Covering 30 different works over a period of about 400 years, Kennedy & Guo begin by explaining the importance of physical culture in China's traditional Military structure, and consider how it may have led to the emergence of the study of martial arts-as-physical culture and mechanism for self defence in wider Chinese society. Each manual is examined by the authors in the context of the time it was written, other possible influences are duly considered.In reviewing thirty of the better known martial arts manuals of 17th through 20th century China and Taiwan, Guo and Kennedy provides oodles of new information about important authors and popular manuals about Chinese martial arts who prior to this book were considered obscure or mythical. Included are numerous photographs and drawings from original publications to flesh out the teachings and people of an earlier age. Background information is provided on the authors and leaders of various styles and methods in China and Taiwan.In martial arts, many stories and ideas have been disseminated through the written words of various authors. Just as in present times, others who read these works and stories were influenced. Kennedy & Guo make serious points for reiterating the influence these popular books had on common and influential Chinese people alike, explaining what these works taught and claimed, showing how available books on martial arts have impacted stories and practice of the Shaolin, literature, and even modern athletics and Wushu in China. A superb study, holds the attention of the reader, many "ah-ha!" moments. It really is high time for a work that examines Chinese martial arts in their historical context using the evidence available, manuals written by the earliest martial artists. Here finally is a work which begins to fill the chasm caused by divergent language and culture. What is left to us is understanding.

This volume, originally published in 1962, was "Judo" Gene LeBell's first book. The basics are covered briefly, and most of the volume is concerned with covering competition techniques and theories, with clear illustrations to explain the dynamics of each move along with precise narrative. Among others, LeBell expounds upon the Triangle Theory (pg 98), The Outrigger Theory (pg 99), counters, fakes, transitions, and entire chapter devoted to grapevines (immobilizing the lower body), strangles, locks, and true to the spirit of a practical nuts-and-bolts fighter like LeBell, a chapter on banned techniques entitled " 'Necking' Not Allowed/Noncompetitive Neck Locks", and another on banned leg locks.This book is in essence a primer on grappling, more than simply a text on competitive judo. Despite having been originally published over 40 years ago, you will find that the tactics covered in this volume are still relevent and effective in todays world--and that nany of the techniques people credit to Brazilin jiu-jitsu were being used in the US of A long before the Gracies first set foot over here. I would recommend this and LeBell's other books "Grappling World" and "Grappling Master" along with Renzo and Royler Gracie's "Brazilian Jiu Jitsu" for anyone who has no problem learning from precise technical manuals on grappling.

Author Chan Kin-man demonstrates a form he has created from his experience in both Northern and Southern Chinese boxing. An entire form in 84 fostures, Chan includes clear written direction and photographs with helpful movement arrows for self instruction. Chan describes the form as being composed of "boxing skills of the Tsai Lee Fo school and the second half being the integration of the essences derived from the boxing arts of the Northern Shaolin, Northern Mantis, Eagle Claw, Arhat Sect, and Tai Chi schools." (page 12)The first portion of the book includes a concise but well exectuted history of Tsai Lee Fo (also written as Choi Li Fut) and kung fu in general. Chan is direct, no tales of flying monks or secret teachings or absurd claims. This man doesn't need to pad his resumee or tell tall tales, he includes the photos of his involvement with mainland Chinese martial arts institutions, and his work in Hong Kong. It is interesting to see a number of diverse Northern & Southern elements combined to positive effect. Practical and artistic without losing too much to modern wushu. I would recommend this and Chan's other books, especially his work "Northern Shaolin Twelve Tantui Boxing Series", and his books on Tsai Lee Fo.

Tsutomu Ohshima has the distinction of being one of the few men still living who studied under Shotokan Karate founder Gichen Funakoshi At Waseda University. This volume is a collection of Ohshima Sensei's insights and advice, originally published in the _Shotokan Karate of America_ newsletter between 1965 and 1995.This is definately a book for the academic minded who are seeking the &quot;why's&quot; of Karate and like details. Please be aware that there are no photo-instruction sequences in this book, and the reader is assumed to have some familiarity with Japanese terminology (there is a glossary, see page 245). In other words, this book doesn't pretend to teach you karate, it has been published for people who are already familiar with at least the fundamentals of the art.Ohshima offers pointers, and spices much of his advice with personal recollections from his days with Funakoshi Sensei. The tone of the book is kindly and the instruction has a personal feel to it. At no time did I find Ohshima coming across as arrogant or unduly harsh. He goes out of his way to give us the &quot;why&quot; of each technique, justifying little movements in kata which some of us may have thought useless or obsolete. Ohshima Sensei breaks the volume down into five parts. In the first section, &quot;Kata&quot; (Forms), 17 subchapters discuss the fine points of everything from Taikyoku, the 3 Tekki and 5 Heian, to Bassai, Kwanku, Hangetsu, Jutte, Empi, Gankaku, Jion, and even a favorite form of Gichen Funakoshi's son Gigo Funakoshi, Ten-no-Kata (&quot;Heaven's Form&quot;, this chapter is very interesting!). The second section, &quot;Kihon&quot; (Basics), Ohshima details specific stances and techniques as well as how to practice, tactics such as Kime (focus) Sabaki (Evading), Ukemi (Falling), Ashibarai (Sweeping), and so on. A total of 41 subchapters are included in this section.In section three, &quot;Kumite&quot; (Sparring), Ohshima discusses Ten no Kata Ura (Heaven's Form Application), Sanbon Kumite (Three-technique sparring), Kihon Ippon Kumite (One technique sparring), Jiyu Kumite (Free Sparring), Self Defense, Torite (Escaping), Irimi (Getting into the opponent), and other subjects, for a total of 11 subchapters. The fourth section, &quot;Practice&quot; discusses the meaning and reason behind Rei (bowing), Healthy Practice, Special Training, Mental Blocks, Ma (Distance and Timing), Speed and Rythm, Grading (reccomendations, requirements for testing), Fasting, and more for a total of 18 subchapters. The last section, &quot;Karate-do&quot; includes three subchapters, &quot;Why We Practice&quot;, &quot;Our Goal for the Twenty-First Century&quot;, and the &quot;Afterword&quot;.If you're looking for a pictoral technical guide to kata or technique, or would like to know about the history of Shotokan, this probably isn't the book for you--try Funakoshi's &quot;Karate-Do Kyohan&quot; or any of the books by Randall Hassell. I recommend this volume for serious students of Shotokan karate or Shotokan derivatives and relatives which practice the same techniques and kata, such as Tang Soo Do, Cerio Kenpo, Wado Ryu, etc. Tsutomu Ohshima's &quot;Notes on Training&quot; makes a superb supplement to &quot;Karate-Do Kyohan&quot;.

This affordable and brief work to the works of Alphonse Mucha offers an introduction to the artist. Includes some early works, preliminary drafts, and finished products. Useful for those who are studying technique--you can see how he drew (pencil--a few in ink). About 60 illustrations in all, 8 of these in color. I remain fascinated with Mucha's perspectives on beauty. Very inspirational!

Lee Ying-arng introduces the Chinese martial art of Pa-kua Chang, also called Bagua Zhang. This was one of the first books available in English which explained the history of Bagua. In the first part, Author Lee explains the name of the art, demonstrates the basic palm positions, footwork, weapons, biography of the great masters of Bagua (including Tung Hai-chuan, Kuo Chi-fung, Jen Chih-cheng, Yin Fu, Yin Yu-chang, Cheng Ting-hwa, Cheng Yu-lung, & Sun Lu-tng), a fold-out genealogical table of schools of Bagua, and a bibliography of early books by the first masters of Bagua including title (Chinese & English), date, translation, authors, etc.The second part of this book is a translation from traditional Chinese characters of Yen Te-hwa's book, "33 Methods of Pa Kua for Self Defense", and includes the original drawings from that work. I found this book fascinating and wish it were still widely available if only for academic study.

Written before the break-up between _Choi_ Hong-hi (sometimes called "General Choi" in recognition of his status as a 2-star general in the S. Korean Army) and the South Korean government over his attempts to include North Korea as a part of the Taekwondo Association, it is interesting to note there is no reference yet in English to "International Taekwon-Do Federation". In this early edition, the first translated into English from Korean, Choi is listed as 9th dan and "President, the Taekwon-Do Association"(page 12). I don't recommend reading too much into that, as it simply suggests that at the time, there was only one Taekwondo Association in Korea outside the individual Kwan (schools) led by their various headmasters. But I digress. All of the photo models and Choi himself are clad in tradition white karate-type Do-bak (gi, or uniforms), no black trim.I actually prefer the layout of this first edition, it isn't as cluttered as the two editions that followed (1972, 1988-92). Choi himself is shown performing some of the techniques, notably breaking boards on page 13, and in a very youthful looking portrait on page 7. This is also the first time that the Chang-Hon Hyung (forms of combat, or patters) are referred to in English and described in total with complete written sentances documenting each move, often with some photographs (page 174-215).Chang Hon was Choi Hong-hi's penname, and means "blue cottage". These forms were devised through the efforts of Choi and his contemporaries to varying degrees, and reflect the influence of Japanese style Karate and Korean innovation. All of the Chang-hon names refer to historic Korean keople, places, groups, or dates. The Twenty original Chang-Hon forms described are are: Chon-Ji, Tan-Gun, To-San, Won-Hyo, Yul-Gok, Chung-Gun, Toi-Gye, Hwa-Rang, Chung-Mu, Kwang-Gae, Po-Un, Kae-Baek, Yu-Sin, Chung-Jang, Ul-Ji, Sam-Il, Choi-Yong, Ko-Dang, Se-Jong, and Tong-Il. In the later 1972 edition, Eui-Am, Yon-Ge, Moon-Moo, and So-San had been devised and were also included. In the 1988-92 edition, Ko-Dang was replaced (not renamed) by Juche, a move which Choi in later interviews and his autobiography said was done to reflect good will and inclusion towards stand-offish closed North Korea. It was interpreted by South Korea as another proof that Choi was disloyal to the south. Today among Taekwondo practitioners there is still some debate about Choi's politics, etc. My advice would be to read his autobiography and later interviews and make your own decision.Also included, interestingly enough, are 15 Hyung of the "Sho-rin and Sho-rei Schools", basically the 15 "orthodox" Kata or forms, of Funakoshi's original Shotokan (pg. 216-239). The fifteen forms may have been practiced by Choi when he learned Karate in Japan, and were/are also common to other Kwan such as the Chung Do Kwan, Moo Duk Kwan, Ji Do Kwan, etc. These also include complete written descriptions covering (in their Korean pronounciation): Heian (1-5), Batsai, Enpi, Rohai, Kouh-Shang-Houh, Tekki (1-3), Jitte, Hangetsu, and Jion.All in all, a good volume on early Taekwondo published before the worst of the political schisms. The techniques are the same as one would find in most of the early kwan (schools), Moo Duk Kwan, Chung Do Kwan, Song Moo Kwan, Ji Do Kwan, etc. On another side note, the Kwan attributed to Choi was called the Oh Do Kwan, meaning "My Way School". Not to reflect that people had to do things _Choi's_ way, but so that each man, brough together by the military, often from different kwan background, would feel he had a school that was too, HIS own individual path (way).Sewn binding, Green hardcover embossed with fist in circle, above which is embossed in silver the Korean Han-gul characters for Taekwondo, and below which is embossed in English, "Taekwon-Do". 1968 English translation of 1965 Korean edition.

I had a tough time putting this FACTUAL account of MMA history down, and didn't get enough sleep over the two day period it took me to read it. An enthralling volume which for the first time offers specific details about the early years of the new Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) competitions--including the "behind the scenes" maneuvering between politicians, promoters, crooks, and media profiteers. Erich Krauss and Bret Aita offer a bout-by-bout description of the first Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC) in 1993 to 1995. We can also read about the first several International Fighting Championships (IFC) from Kiev and the dangers promotors faced by the Ukranian criminal syndicate! Perhaps most interesting though, between descriptions of MMA events taking place at the time, are Krauss and Aida's blow-by-blow analysis of what was going on in the political arena as Senator John McCain, an ardent supporter of boxing (go figure) led the push to ban the "barbaric" sport of MMA.The battle moves from the ring, where skilled athletes contest one another, to the halls of state athletic comissions and congress as MMA fighters and promoters battle to save their sport. Here for the first time we can read a clear account of the events which led to a decline in the availability of MMA events on cable for a time. I'll paraphrase the opening paragraphs of Chapter 12 (pg 147): Leo Hindley, Jr., friend of Sen. John McCain, dropped all MMA events from the roster of cable giant TCI--to shield children from violent t.v. content (they still aired boxing, pro wrestling, and violent movies!!). TCI, Time Warner, Request, Cablevision Systems, and Viewer's Choice/On Demand followed TCI's lead. Through it all, fighters kept training, promotors found other countries in which to host MMA competition, and we are treated to match-by-match reviews of later MMA contests, the gruelling training regimins the MMA fighter endured, and MMA survived. Want to know the dope on Frank and Ken Shamrock, what makes the Gracies so great, how did a kickboxer (Maurice Smith) take MMA by storm, and who the future of MMA rests with (arts, athletes & promotion companies)? This book will answer your questions. There is waaay too much info for me to even begin with all the names and events this volume covers. Very worth the $, a long-awaited gem for the literary martial arts world.

Daeshik Kim is one of my favorite martial arts writers. In the past he has written basic books on karate and judo as well as in-depth works on Taekwondo and karate sparring, Hoshinsul(self defense), and just about the only intellectual treatment of WTF(Olympic style) Tae Kwon Do forms and theory. In "Martial Meditations: Philosophy and the Essence of the Martial Arts"(1989), Kim and Allen Back address the reader as a professor might instruct a class at a university. This is a high-level book I found interesting from cover to cover. Part anthropology text, part history text, part psychology text, and part kinestheology text, the authors go from an explanation of their methodological considerations beginning on page 1, through detailed explanations of development, history, influence of culture upon culture, contemporary martial arts customs, etc.Back and Kim connect Eastern and Western thought, include various experiments, and show their findings and thoughts in a multi dimensional manner. This is everything but martial arts for dummies. The authors draw examples from a wide variety of martial arts (judo, kung fu, aikido, taekwondo, karate, boxing) and used the lense of science and study to view them...vice versa as well. There is not a bias here towards one particular martial art or culture, nor is their any denial going on about certain aspects of history.The table of contents pretty much shows you all of the details:Introduction: Methodological Considerations- East Versus West- Talk Versus Action- Faith Versus ReasonI. The Nature of Martial ArtsChapter 1: A Short History of the Eastern Martial Arts- Origins- Development of Different StylesChapter 2: The Martial Arts Today- Contemporary Practices in the Martial Arts- The Current Variety of the Martial Arts- Rank SystemsChapter 3: What is a Martial Art?- Do and Jutsu- Martial Art and Sport- Martial Art and Art- The Nature of Martial Art- ApplicationsChapter 4: Forms- A Survey of Formal Exercise and Drills- What is a Form- The Purpose of Forms- Evaluation of Forms- BreakingChapter 5: Sparring- Types of Sparring- The Goals of Sparring- Deficiencies of Sparring- Sparring Well- RitualII.

A lively journey with one of Shotokan Karate founder Funakoshi Gichen's last remaining students. A teacher of Karate for over 50 years, Kanazawa Hirokazu begins by sharing his earliest memories of hard working family, and the influence of their examples had upon his development. He is drawn to physical training early on after bad experience where as an 11-year old he is beaten by a bully of an adult known as "Sumo Geezer". Later Kanazawa pursues the art of Karate at Takushoku University. Includes memories of early training, Funakoshi's thoughts on the primative body armor Tokyo University started using for competitions, Nakayama Masatoshi's influence, the first University Exchange-training programs...quite a lot of good stuff.This Autobiography is by no means dry and is strewn with humerous and interesting vignettes, such as when Kanazawa's college karate mates attempt a 3-stooges type prank where each man tells the conductor on a local train that the fellow behind him has the fare...Kanazawa it happened, was the last man in the line! I won't spoil the story with the ending here (page 85). The story line is always moving, always introducing something new or unexpected. You will not find the stereotypical stern samurai here, but a very normal if very driven and dedicated man of ethics. More often, the goodness of people shows through, and the author takes joy from this.There are a number of topics covered here which aren't examined in most other karate books. First, Kanazawa honestly explains his version of the 1972 WUKO karate championships, where he seems convinced there was a conspiracy by European judges to exclude American and Japanese competitors. The funny thing is that for years Europeans have referred to this early competition as a hallmark of fairness, proving that one didn't have to be Japanese to win...Kanazawa is convinced that the European judges simply couldn't see the techniques of the Japanese, they were too fast (page 240). It is interesting to have another perspective from the man who was actually there coaching the Japanese team.Second, this book explains the politics behind the Big JKA split with European instructors, and the freak misunderstanding that led to his expulsion from the JKA. How to deal with such sorrow?"In the beginning, all humans are born naked. Then they die naked. They can take nothing with them. In a similar sense, I stated karate naked, so there was nothing for me to be afraid of in going back to that state..." (page 251).Here is the beginning of Kanazawa's Shotokan Karte-do International Federation. All in all, Kanazawa is very upbeat and optimistic, learning from his hardships and generous with others. From his earliest days he has a keen sense of justice, standing up for the weak and doing what is right for its own sake.The hardcover version is a quality work with sewn binding. There are 20 pages of photographs, showing Kanazawa and mates at college, as well as other notables like Nakayama, Funakoshi, etc. Also some photos of young Kanazawa's incredibly well defined physique. The translation is thoroughly up to date and understandable. When Kanazawa smashes 15 roof tiles with his elbow during a demonstration at a small town. A school teachers warns the children watching, "Kids! Don't try this at home!" (pg 104)

This 1983 volume is composed of two parts: a physical fitness section (includes standards of the Israeli self defense forces at the time of publication), and self defense (Krav Maga). This was the first volume in English on Krav Maga (self defense), translated by Miriam Schlessinger. Long before Krav Maga became a trendy (and costly) &quot;martial art&quot;, it was a practical no-nonsense method of defense which could be utilized by anyone, anywhere. While awareness of Krav Maga has improved, it appears this method of self defense has only recently begun, among some practitioners, to accumulate the same &quot;cultural baggage&quot; which has helped drag down other &quot;traditional&quot; arts which once had practical value--thankfully, I don't think Krav Maga's sensible &amp; short philosophy will allow serious practitioners to become so bogged down in historical and cultural studies that they will be able to neglect practicality.This volume in its stark simplicity is an interesting contrast to more recently published works on this topic. Author Colonel David Ben-Asher credits First Sgt. Major Emi Lichtenfeld (Imi Sde-or) and Lt Col. Shaike Barak for the Krav maga section of the book. The techniques shown are plain and simple self-defense, the same methods shown in other basic volumes. For a more thorough assessment, see Imi Sde-or and Eyal Yanilov's more recent &quot;Krav Maga&quot;.

A very good demonstration of the Moi Fah form. Unlike some of the books that came out of Hong Kong in the early 1980's, Kwon Wing Lam includes the applications of the techniques. Also includes Chinese and English table for the techniques of the set, and well written sections on the history of Northern Shaolin (or Sil Lum) and kung fu in general.

This was the first English language book by someone who had actually studied Chinese martial arts in Asia (Taiwan, as China was 'cleansing' all their old school martial arists at the time--before their potential as $-making tourist attractions became evident). Some of Smith's observations seem exaggerated, but he is a believer in chi gung, so this deosn't surprise me, and shouldn't annoy skeptics who can read around the personal beliefs/handicaps of martial arts writers. Smith is a VERY knowledgeable martial artist (even if you don't buy into all of the chi stories), and his experiences are worth reading about. He discusses many teachers whi have made a huge impact on the Chinese-martial arts world without trying too hard to sell himself. Other good books in this vein (Chinese martial arts books which are semi-autobiographical works describing the training and experiences of the authors) include Mark Salzman's two books, &quot;Iron &amp; Silk&quot; and pre-quil &quot;Lost In Place&quot;, and a book by Howard Thomas called &quot;Tai Chi Training in China&quot;. Smith's latest book, &quot;Martial Musings&quot; is worth a read too.

Presented with little fanfare and mysticism, this practical guide has probably influenced thousands of martial artists. More than a how-to book, Lee Ynig-arng presents the 100-day iron palm training method in its historical context, including the story of legendary Ku Yu Cheong, who could shatter stacks of bricks placed directly on the floor. In fact, in this book there is an account supported by none other than Eagle Claw's Lau Fot-mang of Ku actually killing a horse with a palm strike (page 8).Devoid of all allusions to secrecy or "the secrets are too great for you grasshopper" arrogance, Iron Palm training methods were presented for the first time in English by this book. All you need to know about training, equipment, medicine, theory, and history. Simple and direct in presentation, a useful primer for this fascinating combative component.Also included is a complete translation of Shaolin Monk Poon Shin's "Secret Discourse on the Use of the Palm" in Chinese and english, with a complete explanation in English. Chapters include:1. Origin of Iron Palm2. Formal Exercises in Relation to Basic Exercises3. Basic Exercises in Relation to age4. Basic Exercises in Relation to Medication5. Three Important Requisits in Training6. Different Methods7. Lee's Hundred Dy Method (Equipment, Method, Medication, Precautions, Other Measures, Testing Out)8. The Application of the Palm in Defense (Slapping, Throwing, Cutting, Stamping, Dotting)9. The "All-Roung" Method of Training (Salient Features, Method itself)10. Explanatory Notes & Translation on the "Secret Discourse on the Use of the Palm"11. Questions & AnswersOf definite historical value.

Martial arts and film buffs will enjoy this book, which is a straightforward autobiography (written with the assistance of Joe Hyams). Be forwarned that this book was published in 1988 (at least my hardcover version), so the filmography doesn't cover his more recent works.Norris describes his experiences from childhood, to the time spent in the armed forces, where he originally took up the matrial art of Tang Soo Do under Jae-chul Shin (who today runs the World Tang Soo Do Association).This volume describes Norris's tournament days, including quite a bit about his competition experiences. There is also information about his family life, his entry into film making during his time as a karate (Tang Soo Do) instructor, and his experiences as a self-made actor in Hollywood. Throughout, he is honest as he describes his triumphs and mistakes.Chuck Norris is the quintessential all-American guy who worked his tail off, took a big gamble, and came out on top. This book describes his journey from average joe, to martial arts instructor, to professional film star. This book includes two sections of photographs which show Norris from childhood, with family, in the services, in karate competition, and during the filming of his movies.

Author Stanley Pranin includes a huge variety of information in this encyclopedia on people in all different branches of Aikido and related arts, places of historical inretest, specific events, different styles of aikido and their founders, and styles related to Aikido. Unfortunately, this volume has been out of print for some time. Pranin does offer an updated CD-ROM version of the Encyclopedia through the online Aikido Journal (formerly Aiki News), but I myself prefer something I can physically handle and access without having to plug in!Includes information about Ueshiba Morihei, Ueshiba Kisshomaru, Takeda Sokaku, Tohei Koichi, Saotome Mitsugi, Saito Morihiru, Tomiki, and many more. Japanese and non-Japanese instructors are covered, and Stanley Pranin has gone through the trouble of authenticating many of the anks held by prominent Aikido people. I hope someday we will see an updated version in print!

Narrated by Masaaki Hatsumi, 34th generation lineage holder of the Togakure school of ninpo (and holder of 8 other traditional Japanese martial lineages, at least 6 of which have been verified), This book is the closest thing Hatsumi sensei has written to an autobiography. Hatsumi introduces us to his teacher, Takamatsu Sensei. Chapter 2 includes an interview with Takamatsu sensei conducted by Hatsumi, and throughout he discusses his experiences training with his teacher, his love for his teacher, and how he came to understand the ideas Takamatsu imparted to him.Numerous learning incidents are recounted by Hatsumi, both while training, and also while simply spending time with his teacher. Each chapter includes a traditional story which imparts something of the spirit of ninpo to the reader. Hatsumi Sensei's writings are rife with anecdotes, recollections, historical observations, and cautiously thought out conclusions. Most touching I found to be his visit to Takamatsu Sensei's tomb accompanied by the Sensei's daughter, and the thought she shared with him (page 68).For those looking for an introduction to ninjutsu, I'd recommend Masaaki Hatsumi's other book, &quot;Ninjutsu: History and Traditions&quot;. For the reader prepared to go beyond learning about ninja weapons and general history, this volume &quot;Essence of Ninjutsu: The Nine Traditions&quot; offers a look at the heart of a kindly man and a profound art.

This volume is composed of a collection of columns originally penned by Randall Hassell for Black Belt Magazine during the early 1980's. Although Hassell is a Shotokan old timer, I certainly wouldn't limit this book to those who practice only Shotokan, or even just Japanese style karate. The concepts and personal experiences detailed by the author are universal throughout martial arts study. Each chapter is lively and covers a philosophical idea. Hassell recounts actual events which are not only fun to read about, but get their point across. There is no vague misticism here, you will find plenty of honesty and introspection--beneficial to us all. This is another winner from Damashi, of benefit to any martial artist who enjoys reading about our arts.

I took my kid (age 6) to see "Cars" last week, not really knowing what to expect. I've never been into racing, but was attracted by the concept (anyone else remember the shortlived cartoon "Wheelie"?). Both of us were able to connect with the humor right away, which like the diverse characters in this film spans several generations. The concept of a world populated entirely by inanimate vehicles (mostly cars, but a tractor or train here and there) is a relatively original one on the big screen, and the studio must have had a lot of fun with this one.Character development was terrific--just as each make and model of vehicle has its own technical characteristics in real life, each personality in "Cars" has its own talents and quirks. The plot revolves around rookie racer Lightning McQueen, who is part of a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup, and must cross the country to Los Angeles where there will be a tie-breaker between himself, dependable veteran The King, and perpetual second-placer Chick Hicks.Along the road to Los Angeles, Lightning McQueen's selfishness is the cause of an unintended detour to a little town called Radiator Springs. Radiatior Springs is a nifty village on route 66 complete with chrome and neon styling that the new interstate left off the map years ago. Characters include the older and wiser Doc Hudson (Hornet), who has a secret past and manages to mentor Lighting McQueen and teach him a thing or two. Sally is a Porsche who left fast-paced Los Angeles to settle down in Radiator Springs and open a Motel. 'Mater is the town's friendly (if rusty) towtruck with a true sense of country humor. Flo runs the service station, Ramon the Paint and Detail shop (always with a new coat!), Luigi the tire store...There really is something for everyone, including a running humorous dialogue between "Sarge", an Army-regulation olive drab AMC Jeep who runs the local military surplus shop, and Fillmore, a '60's VW Bus with a psychadelic paint job.I'm not going to give away too much detail, I don't want to spoil the experience for fellow viewers. My kid loved this film and understood the humor. There were a lot of laugh out loud moments for the both of us. As a parent, I liked the lessons "Cars" taught about ethics, hard work, respect, kindness, keeping your word, and the importance of friendship. Not to mention appreciating things that aren't necessarily brand new or in the fast lane! A cute movie, fun for the whole family, a reminder that the best things in life are sometimes hidden off the main thoroughfare. Oh, and hang around past the credits--you WILL be rewarded with the punch line for an earlier gag!

A good variety and collection of books which, for whatever reason, were excluded by the early Church (Catholic) councils from what became the Old Testament and New Testament. Initially published in 1926, each one of the "Lost Books" includes a brief introduction giving background and history. Like the editors of this two-part volume, I do not feel it is necessary to share my opinion of the historicity of these works, each reader can decide for him or herself what is shadow and what is reality, and consider the debate which at one time engulfed some of these books.This volume is divided into two sections. The first is called "Lost Books of the Bible", and includes works which deal with Jesus & company, and may at one time have been considered part of the New Testament Gospel. Includes are the following 26 "lost" books:Mary, Protevangelion, I. Infancy, II. Infancy, Christ and Abgarus, Nicodemus, The Apostles' Creed, Laodiceans, Paul and Senica, Paul and Thecla, I. Clement, II. Clement, Barnabus, Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, Polycarp, Philippians, I. Hermas-Visions, II. Herman-Commands, III. Hermas-Similitudes, Letters of Herod and Pilate, The Last Gospel of PeterPart the Second is titled "The Forgotten Books of Eden", and includes works which are suited to the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. They too were excluded by Jewish (and some Christian) councils due to doubts about their age and origins. Includes are the following 20 books:The First Book of Adam and Eve, The Second Book of Adam and Eve, The Secrets of Enoch, The Psalms of Solomon, The Odes of Solomon, The Letter of Aristeas, The Fourth Book of Maccabees, The Story of Ahikar, The Testament of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Joseph, BenjaminThis affordable book offers a thought provoking read for those with a general interest "outside of the box". While the translations are somewhat dated, they are not difficult to understand.

Volume 1 has 130 pages, Volume 2 has 102 pagesThese two books belong together, indeed they are difficult to find apart or together! James I. Wong is a scholar of the Chinese martial arts, he has also written and co-written with students a number of other books on Monkey Style, Crane Kung Fu, and Northern Style. Despite the popularity of Chinese martial arts, it is STILL difficult to find a decent book on Chinese martial arts history! This series is a must for the dedicated historian. I'd also recommend another book called "The Spring and Autumn of Chinese Martial Arts" by Kang, Ge-wu for those with an interest in Chinese Martial Arts History.These is not a single picture or technique in either of these books! They are completely in English, with oodles of single-spaced small faced type paragraphs. Each page has on average 500-638 words---PER PAGE. Compare THAT with most of the so-called martial arts history books out there today. All Chinese terms are listed in English and Chinese, each volume has a number of exhaustive appendixes giving the proper Chinese names with written characters for everything to gung fu style names, historical figures, techniques, medical terms, philosophical terms, herbs, etc.I was impressed with the serious nature of this book. This is not a volume filled with "fluff" where some self-appointed guru tries to make himself sound impressive by using big words (usually incorrectly!). James Wong offers here a legitimate Academic work, an in-depth thesis. Very deep, very thorough, very interesting, extremely good! Most people would probably be happy to stick to instructionals or basic books, which is fine.

Originally published in 1978 by Ohara and since reprinted privately by JL Publications (and thus somewhat harder to obtain), this is the first in a three volume series by Master Teacher Joo-Bang Lee. This first volume of three covers history, Theory, Stances, Falling, Striking/punching, Kicking, and blocking. Included is a complete catalog of techniques from basic to advanced. The sequences of photographs are particularely good, with four to nine clear photos per technique. Volume Two covers joint locks, throws, sweeps and counters, defense from disadvataged positions (sitting, etc). Volume Three covers throwing, defense against weapons, striking vital points, a few cane and baton techniques, choking, opponent control, and defense against more than one opponent.Although there is some debate as to the historicity of Hwarang-Do as an "ancient" martial art separate from Hapkido and Taekwondo --Lee claims Hwarang Do has a completely separate native Korean origin despite its remarkable similarity to other forms of Korean martial art such as Hapkido and Kuk Sool-- this debate does nothing to detract from the technical expertise evident in the presentation of this book and the two which follow it. Author Lee Joo-Bang was at one time a direct (and senior) student of Hapkido founder Choi Yong-sul, and part of an original core group of dedicated martial arts men in Korea who traded techniques with one another in a progressive and friendly manner. Eventually due to competition these bonds of brotherhood dissolved, and today there is a lot of mystery and quarreling over what happened in those early days to cause so much dissention. A special attraction of this series of books is that most of the techniques are demonstrated by Master Joo-Bang Lee himself, and not younger students, the rare exception being a series of spectacular flying/jumping kicks shown by his eldest son, Henry Lee.Among the few faults I can find with this series of books is the format of the book itself (not the actual layout). I believe Lee's work would benefit greatly by being reintroduced in a larger format, and certainly a reworking of the section on history could include a number of the photos from his collection and personal recollections of the "early years" which impacted so much on Korea's modern martial arts. Hwarang-Do is certainly worthy of a nice large, hardcover volume built to last. Then again, these paperback editions offer affordability and easy access to the general public. For that reason and for the quality and scope of technique presented, Lee's three volume collection is absolutely worthwhile including in any martial arts collection.

Originally published in 1978 by Ohara and since re-released by JL Publications, this is the second in a three volume series by Master Teacher Joo-Bang Lee. Volume Two covers joint locks, self-defense against grabs (including locking and throwing), defense from disadvataged positions (sitting, etc), and defense against kicks and punches which include a variety of detailed sewwping, throwing, locking and striking techniques put into practice. Each photographic sequence is well-detailed and clear. As with the first volume in the series, the majority techniques are clearly demonstrated by Master Joo-Bang Lee himself. Volume One of this series covers history, Theory, Stances, Falling, Striking/punching, Kicking, and blocking. Volume Three covers throwing, defense against weapons, striking vital points, a few cane and baton techniques, choking, opponent control, and defense against more than one opponent.Although there is some debate as to the historicity of Hwarang-Do as an "ancient" Korean martial art separate from Hapkido and Taekwondo --Lee claims Hwarang Do has a completely separate native Korean origin despite its remarkable similarity to other forms of Korean martial art such as Hapkido and Kuk Sool-- this debate does nothing to detract from the technical expertise evident in the presentation of this book and the two which follow it.

Certainly a more specific and inclusive history of Master Lee's own experiences, along with photos from his extensive historic collection could only benefit this series. The format of these books as well (not the actual layout) would benefit greatly by being reintroduced in a larger format.

This is the third volume of a series on Hwarang Do by Master Teacher Joo-Bang Lee originally published in 1978 by Ohara and since re-released by JL Publications. This third book is a fitting capstone to this series, offering a complete overview of a worthy and useful martial discipline. Volume Three includes a brief overview of the weapons of Hwarang Do, Defense against knife, sword, gun, defense with cane and short stick, Throwing techniques, choking techniques, opponent control, and a section on vital point including charts and photos. Throughout, a variety of detailed photographs illustrate sweeping, throwing, locking and striking techniques are demonstrated by Master Joo-Bang Lee himself. Volume One of this series covers history, Theory, Stances, Falling, Striking/punching, Kicking, and blocking.

I have no doubt about the author's sincerity in offering this personal interpretation of Musashi's original work, "Book of 5 Spheres" (or "The Book of 5 Rings"). The problem I have with what Stephen Kaufman has done to Musashi's book deals more with his implied suggestion that this edition is the result of an actual ~translation~ which he was responsible for (see pages xi-xii, "Translator's Note"). In fact, when asked Mr. Kaufman has admitted that this volume (and some others he has written) are not translations at all, but rather his own personal interpretations of English translations done by other authors--something he DOESN'T bother to communicate to his readers. The title of this volume, at odds with the "translator's note" on pgs xi -xii, is actually "...The Definitive _Interpretation_ of Miyamoto Musashi's Classic Book of Strategy". I fail to understand why Kaufman confuses his readers by mixing and matching interpretation with translation. It should be noted that Mr Kaufman himself does NOT speak or read Japanese, and in fact innocently named his own martial arts school "Dojo no Hebi" ("Place of Practice's Snake"), when he was trying for "Dojo of the Snake" (which in Japanese would have been "Hebi no Dojo", meaning "The Snake's Place of Practice"). Innocent mistakes yes, but one would expect a Black belt of the 10th Dan (degree grade) and a proclaimed "Hanshi" (master practitioner) to at least check his spelling with someone who _could_ speak the language he was using.Kaufman doesn't bother to provide a bibliography of which English translations he used, nor does he include notes explaining how he drew his conclusions from the texts he studied. I am bothered by the fact that many of Musashi's words have been heavily edited, re-arranged, or deleted altogether by this author until they have been removed entirely from their original context. In doing this, Mr. Kaufman has actually ALTERED the _meaning_ of Musashi's work! What remains appears to be little more than a new age self-help guide for modern martial artists which has retained a smidgeon of flavor from Musashi's original work.A brief example illustrating Kaufman's tendancy to put his own words in Musashi's mouth is in the fourth paragraph on page 6 of Kaufman's book. Kaufman reworks Musashi's words regarding Merchants as a class to read, "Merchants are a ridiculed class because they produce nothing except profit from the work of others." Two other men who have actually translated Musashi's work from the original Japanese suggest nothing sinister in Musashi's original work. Victor Harris in his translation of "A Book of Five Rings" offers: "The way of the merchant is always to live by taking profit" (page 41, 1974). Translator Thomas Cleary offers the same sentence as: "Whatever the business, merchants make a living from the profits they earn acording to their particular status" (page 7, 1993). This is a minor demonstration of the differences between Kaufman's work and those offered by actual translators--the translators make an effort to convey to the reader the actual meaning of Musashi's words in English, while Kaufman crafts a meaning which never existed in Musashi's work. Suffice to say, Kaufman's interpretation seems heavily influenced by his modern view of martial arts and his concept of what samurai may have been like four centuries ago. It bears little resemblance to competent translations of Musashi's writings.I recommend two excellent translations of Musashi's work which stay true to the original Japanese. The first is "A Book of Five Rings" translated by Victor Harris, a mechanical engineer and technical interpreter of Japanese language who not only practiced kendo (Japanese fencing), but studied this art in Japan for 3 years under Ito Kyoitsu at the Seijudo Dojo. A second recommendation is "The Book of Five Rings" by Thomas Cleary, another professional translator. Unlike Kaufman, I did not find translations by these men to be "intellectual exercises in translating Japanese to English" (pg xi). I found legitimate translations by competent translators who were clear and direct...I suspect most scholarly people, whether students of martial arts or not, will draw a similar conclusions upon comparing Kaufman's book to any actual translation.

Although I must admit I don't buy into sensational claims of chi power, the supernatural, and such, I found author Glenn Morris's account of his journey along the martial arts path entertaining and enjoyable. This was one of those books I lost sleep over--reading when I should be getting a good night's rest. One unique feature of this volume is Chapter 6, "The Godan or Master's Test for a Ninja", where Morris describes not only how the Go-dan (5th degree black belt) test in Bujinkan Ninjutsu/Taijutsu is conducted, but his own experience taking this test (he failed the first two times). He writes, "The fifth degree means you are a master of the basic physical, mental, and spiritual fundamentals with your own contributions to make to the system." (page 87)Morris describes his philosophy of ninpo (ninja way, path of ninjutsu) as he relates amazing experiences with men such as Masaaki Hatsumi who is one of the world's few ~practicing~ ninpo historians (at least 6 of Hatsumi's 9 ranks in traditional Japanese martial arts have been verified), and Stephen Hayes who is Hatsumi's seniormost American Student (see chapter 8). There are a plethora of other individuals whose names will no doubt be recognized by Bujinkan folks, esoterica buffs, and amateur martial arts historians alike.Morris is an interesting man, and has no qualms about candidly sharing his spiritual beliefs and personal experiences with his readers. He describes seeing different colored auras around people during their practice, sending and receiving chi,and his own experience with the spirituality of sex. I'm not too sure the colored, shimmering auras Glenn Morris sees are anywhere but in his own mind, and I don't buy his inflated views of his own psychic prowess which he sometimes seems to cloak in selflessness (notably absent when he describes his first two failures during his Go-dan test). My skepticism however, hasn't stopped me from appreciating his unique point of view. If you enjoy reading the autobiographies of martial artists or interesting people in general, Glenn Morris has written this volume for you!

The title of this book, &quot;Zen Shaolin Karate&quot; unfortunately conjures the image of an Americanized kenpo style. Nothing is farther from the truth--Author Nathan Johnson offers a superb interpretation of two of the most widely practiced fundamental kata (forms) of Okinawa Karate, the Sanchin Kata of Goju Ryu, and the Naihanchi Kata of Shorin-ryu. Johnson has researched these two forms, and reconstructed them as he believes they were performed before being altered to teach to the masses. We see for the first tome in an English language publication, Sanchin performed open handed. Naihanchin is presented as one complete form in three parts (as researchers believe it was performed prior to Itosu's time). For both forms, bunkai emphasizing locking and grappling is demonstrated, including close up photos showing how the locks are performed.Johnson is in essence, apparently attempting to reintroduce the older Chinese methods of study, a growing trend among some Okinawa Karate stylists. My one sticking point with this book is Johnson's lack of bibliographic sources, he isn't very specific about how he did his research and how he reached his conclusions. What were his influences, who did he talk to, who did he study with, what articles and volumes did he read? Johnson's second volume, &quot;Barefoot Zen&quot; does much to remedy these questions. Both volumes are excellent studies which will be helpful to anyone going through the stages of paring down and understanding thri art.

A wonderful collection of fact-based stories from the real life experiences of a retired Southern Pacific Railroad Freight Conductor and Brakeman. For those who aren't familiar with railroad operations, the Conductor is the trainman who in essence functions as the train's captain in charge of the rest of the crew, manifest (whatever you're carrying), etc. The Conductor is often assisted by another trainman called a Brakeman. The Engineer runs and has the last say on the locomotive, and back in the "old days", was assisted by a locomotive Fireman (not the same as firefighter!). As with most railroad autobiographies, some names and places have been changed to protect the innocent...and more frequently the not-so-innocent!As a railroader myself, I found Frandsen's book to be factually correct and on the mark as far as railroad operations go. The tales he relates are cleverly presented, and range from funny as in chapter 10 "The Peacock" where he witnesses a co-worker try to bird-nap the aforementioned with hilarity ensueing, to harrowing tales like Chapter 6 "CO + CO2", where the author barely survives suffocation in a rear locomotice unit while traversing a tunnel several miles long.Frandsen expounds upon a variety of events and folks, derailments, the general public, co-workers, strange happenings, accidents, management, you name it. This book offers a good historic view of what it was to be a railroader in the United States between about the 1950's to right around the early 1980's. A number of Railroad icons which have disappeared into the sunset of time are memorialized in the memories recorded in Frandsen's book, including the caboose (where the Conductor originally had his office--now the trainmen sit up front with the engineer), hand signs which are now-a-days infrequent due to the use of radios and handhelds, large crews of up to 5 men for switching operations and communicating hand signs to the locomotive, and most recently on many freight roads in the U.S., the Brakeman. Oh, and let's not foget the Good Ol' SP!!!I hasten to add, many of the things, signals, signs, ways of working together, attitudes, landmarks, and an affinity for the unbelievable still exist in the railroad world. The stories flow well throughout the volume, are skillfully relayed, and should prove most enjoyable to railroaders, railfans, anyone who enjoys real-life action or is curious about railway operations.

Kem Parton has crafted a phenomenal tale of railway terrorism and heroism which caused me to re-commence that nasty habit of nail biting (drat it!). Every page is another suspence-packed step towards unpredictable and surprising situations, and one humdinger of a conclusion! With no schmaltz and no faking, Parton's original wit and smooth transitions allow the story to flow freely throughout. Clever situations and well-rounded character development mark this volume for classic status on par with other well known suspense/mystery writers whose works are frequently seen lining the bestseller rack in the supermarket. Transcon Railway, the Railway Transportation Union, railroaders Cal Farranger and Megan Langford to name a few are all larger than life representations of the American railroad world. Believable, detailed and accurate on railroad technical matters such as running the engine, switching, dispatching, etc., this novel weaves the railroad world through the story in a way the non-railroading public can understand and railroaders will appreciate. Someone needs to call Hollywood, because if the right director gets a hold of a proper script for "End of the Line", it'll put films like "Speed" and "Runaway Train" out to the rip (repair) track. So put that bottle of eye drops down next to you on the coffee table, and get ready to pull and all nighter--this volume won't let you rest! This railroad Conductor gives "End of the Line" Two Thumbs Up, which is the railway hand sign for tie it down & go home. Parton has hit a home run!!!

Dragon Associates & Tsunami Productions simply offer the best professional grade martial arts instructionals in the English language. This performance by Matayoshi Shinpo is no exception! In addition to a total of 6 Kobudo Kata, Matayoshi Sensei demonstrates two Hakutsuru (white crane) kata learned from his father Matayoshi Shinko, who in turn learned them directly from Go Ken Ki, the Chinese tea merchant and White Crane Teacher who lived on Okinawa before WWII.The scenery is beautiful, many scenes (both Hakutsuru and the Eku [Oar] kata) using the Ocean as a backdrop. All kata are shown from different angles, in demonstration and then in teaching. Likewise, bunkai (applications) of kata are shown as well, with noted Goju Ryu teacher Morio Higaonna serving as the uke (assistant). I found this method more stimulating and less repetitive...David Chambers narrates clearly, and where there is music, it is not distracting.This production opens with a demonstration of the first Hakutsuru Kata, and then moves to the Bo (long staff), for which 3 Kata are shown: Choun no Kun, Sakugawa no Kun, and Suishi no Kun. Matayoshi Tonfa follows, then Matayoshi Nunchaku, and an impressive rendition of Tsuken Akachu no Eku Kata done on a sandy beach, showing the practical purpose of tactics utilizing sand...the details of this specific form would have been completely lost with only a studio demonstration.Most forms are taught in studio, with a black backdrop which makes it easier to focus on the subject. Matayoshi is clear about little nuances often forgotten, a twist of the wrist here, a stamp or turn of the ankle there. This first volume closes out with a demonstration of a second Hakutsuru kata, which is simililar but not identical to the one shown in this film's opening. Please note that it is difficult to learn from a dvd with no prior experience. Those with some kobudo experience, or individuals looking for an informative survey will not be disappointed. Tsunami DVD's are higher priced than many other instructinals, but from my experience I can confirm as the old saying goes: higher priced, but worth every penny!

The brief introduction contained in this volume describes the exercises within as simple, requiring no martial arts experience to learn. In reading through this volume, I found that to be accurate--If you're already studying a traditional school of Chinese martial arts, this book probably isn't going to offer you anything new. However, this book is perfect for anyone with little or no background in Chinese martial arts who is looking for a decent low-impact workout.This no-nonsense 130-page volume is a collection of rudamentary exercises taken from a variety of different Chinese chi-gung and martial arts sources. The focus of this book is entirely upon the physical exercises themselves, you will find nothing on history or philosophy. Illustrated with numerous easy to follow photographs demonstrating the techniques, each sequence is accompanied by succinct descriptive narratives.This volume contains 11 chapters of exercise &quot;sets&quot; presented in 2 sections. In the first section are: 1. Breathing Exercises (2 exercises), 2. Stretching Exercises (9 movements), 3. Waist Exercises (5), 4. Leg Exercises (7), 5. Arm and Finger Exercises (5), 6. Ankle Exercises (2), 7. Full Body Exercises (4), 8. Relaxation Exercises (2), 9. Dry Bath Exercises (4), and two advaced exercise sets, 10. Tai Chi Chuan Exercises (10), and 11. Sinew Transforming Exercises (14).

For those who love waterCOLOR, I recommend Fu Ji Tsang's "My Chinese Sketchbook". A veritable explosion of vivid oranges, reds, purples, and blues highlighted with virtually every color accent the eye could see--or imagine. Tsang's sense of balance working with grades of light, shade, and space are a testament to his ability to translate what he sees onto the paper.This work highlights his depictions of the diverse people and places of China, from Fujian to the Tibetan and Muslim regions. Tsang shows himself able to depict a tribesman's face with painstaking detail (p. 124-125), or an ornate garden and dwelling in what appear to have been just a few misty strokes ("The Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou", p.47). It looks to have been an easy feat...but the balance and cohesiveness of each work speak of Tsang's experitise--there is no simplicity in the artist's eye. A real treat!

Piero Scanziani journeys the world in search of authentic mystics and the keys to theit understanding in this autobiographical work. A self-professed Christian with no plans to convert to any other religion, Scanziani does not shy from exploring other avenues to self understanding.Scanziani's journey begins in the temples of India, where he commences the process of meeting with and trying to distill the essence of beliefs held by various mystics. Then on to America to experience the Native Peyote religion, mystery in Europe, Persia to witness the Sufi Dervishes and queri a Sufi master. A simple Taoist master in China, Buddhists in Bangcok, and to Tokyo, Japan to meet in person the great Aikido Master, Ueshiba Morihei (which he does!). Back to India for more...and an interesting culmination of his journey on Mount Athos in Greece.Unpretentious, honest, and holds the attention. One segment flows well into the next. Scantziani doesn't make the mistake of trying to make each individual appear perfect, they are presented in their human light, as he found them. Oh, and in answer to the question 'what the heck is an Entronaut', Scanziani coined the term for mystical searchers:"Entronauts, full of mystery. Entronauts do not look towards the outside, they look in, and study how we are made..." (page 27)

Hayes has done us an incredible favor in offering a glimpse of what a relationship between a teacher and a disciple should be. This volume is one long interview between Hayes and his teacher, Bujinkan Taijutsu (ninjutsu) Headmaster Masaaki Hatsumi. The dialogue is occasionally spiced with interjections from Mrs. Hatsumi and Hayes' wife Rumiko, as topics ranging from medicine, fighting, Tibetan martial arts, ninpo history, theory, philosophy, mikkyo Buddhism, women in martial arts, rank, and many other concepts. This volume more than any other will answer those funny little questions that puzzle your teacher (in other words, this moves far beyond basics into meaning and understanding).It is honestly a treat to see between two serious martial scholars a relationship built on love, repect, and encouragement without a lot of formal digression. Stephen Hayes also talks about his early days of involvement in the martial arts. Hatsumi, a bonesetter (doctor) by trade, is a seasoned martial artist and one of the foremost ninpo scholars alive today. This volume is excellent when read in sequence with Hatsumi's other book, &quot;Essence of Ninjutsu&quot;, and &quot;The Grandmaster's Book of Ninja Training&quot;, although this is probably the easiest for a non-Bujinkan person to digest. Keep in mind this is NOT a how-to-be-a-ninja book (no sequence pictures of guys in black stalking about with straight-bladed ninja sword!), most of the volume is dialogue with some still shots of Hayes, Hatsumi, etc. thrown in. If you're looking for knowledge, this is the book. It is just a pity that there aren't more works written by such fascinating people in this manner.

I have no doubt about the author's sincerity in offering this personal interpretation of Musashi's original work, "Book of 5 Spheres" (or "The Book of 5 Rings"). The problem I have with what Stephen F. Kaufman has done to Musashi's book deals more with his implied suggestion that this edition is the result of an actual ~translation~ which he was responsible for (see pages xi-xii, "Translator's Note"). In fact, when asked Mr. Kaufman has admitted that this volume (and some others he has written) are not translations at all, but rather his own personal interpretations of English translations done by other authors--something he DOESN'T bother to communicate to his readers. The title of this volume, at odds with the "translator's note" on pgs xi -xii, is actually "...The Definitive _Interpretation_ of Miyamoto Musashi's Classic Book of Strategy". I fail to understand why Kaufman confuses his readers by mixing and matching interpretation with translation. It should be noted that Mr Kaufman himself does NOT speak or read Japanese, and in fact innocently named his own martial arts school "Dojo no Hebi" ("Place of Practice's Snake"), when he was trying for "Dojo of the Snake" (which in Japanese would have been "Hebi no Dojo", meaning "The Snake's Place of Practice"). Innocent mistakes yes, but one would expect a Black belt of the 10th Dan (degree grade) and a proclaimed "Hanshi" (master practitioner) to at least check his spelling with someone who _could_ speak the language he was borrowing.Kaufman doesn't bother to provide a bibliography of which English translations he used, nor does he include notes explaining _how_ he drew his conclusions from the texts he studied. I am bothered by the fact that many of Musashi's original words have been heavily edited, re-arranged, or deleted altogether by this author until they have been removed entirely from their original context. In doing this, Mr. Kaufman has actually ALTERED the _meaning_ of Musashi's work! What remains appears to be little more than a new age self-help guide for modern martial artists which has retained a smidgeon of flavor from Musashi's original work.A brief example illustrating Kaufman's tendancy to put his own words in Musashi's mouth is in the fourth paragraph on page 6 of Kaufman's book. Kaufman reworks Musashi's words regarding Merchants as a class to read, "Merchants are a ridiculed class because they produce nothing except profit from the work of others." Two other men who have actually translated Musashi's work from the original Japanese suggest nothing sinister in Musashi's original work concerning the merchant class.Victor Harris in his translation of "A Book of Five Rings" offers: "The way of the merchant is always to live by taking profit" (page 41, 1974). Translator Thomas Cleary offers the same sentence as: "Whatever the business, merchants make a living from the profits they earn acording to their particular status" (page 7, 1993).This is a minor demonstration of the differences between Kaufman's work and those offered by actual QUALIFIED translators--the translators make an effort to convey to the reader the actual meaning of Musashi's words in English, while Kaufman crafts a new meaning which never existed in Musashi's original work. Suffice to say, Kaufman's interpretation seems heavily influenced by his modern view of martial arts and his concept of what he feels samurai may have been like four centuries ago. It bears little resemblance to competent translations of Musashi's writings. Or perhaps it is Kaufman's guilt over his own attempt to exploit the expertise and writings of a respected master.I recommend two excellent translations of Musashi's work which stay true to the original Japanese. The first is "A Book of Five Rings" translated by Victor Harris, a mechanical engineer and technical interpreter of Japanese language who not only practiced kendo (Japanese fencing), but studied this art in Japan for 3 years under Ito Kyoitsu at the Seijudo Dojo. A second recommendation is "The Book of Five Rings" by Thomas Cleary, another professional translator. Unlike Kaufman, I did not find translations by these men to be "intellectual exercises in translating Japanese to English" (pg xi). I found legitimate translations by competent translators who were clear and direct...I suspect most scholarly people, whether students of martial arts or not, will draw a similar conclusions upon comparing Kaufman's book to any actual translation.

What makes this book valuable are the unique and candid insights offered by the women interviewed. All are interesting--and each differs markedly from the others in experience and interpretation of what Aikido is, what Aikido means. Because some people seem to be frightened by anything which includes women alone, I should probably mention that this is NOT a &quot;man-bashing&quot; book. It simply focuses upon the experiences of a unique subgroup of people--women Aikido-ka (Aikido Students). Nor would I categorize this as a &quot;woman's book&quot;, as I think that ANY aikido practitioner, male or female, will appreciate and enjoy the recollections of the unique people featured here.While it is popular (and conveniently pithy) to say that there is no difference between male and female in Aikido, the truth is that women often are treated differently by other Aikido people (or in certain organizations), sometimes because of the teacher's view of them as females, sometimes because they as individuals have different views, needs or goals. We are living in the real world, and unfortunately not the pleasant nirvana of ultimate Aikido ideals--people must still cope with fear and sorrow along with joy and power. The women in this book shy away from neither.The author has put together a unique collection of experiences collected from interviews with a diverse range of women. If you enjoy reading about the personal experiences of people who delve inside the meaning of their martial art, people who love to practice and find meaning, you will enjoy reading this book. Included are: Catherine Tornbom, Lorraine DiAnne, Carol Sanoff, Cress Forester, Sue Ann McKean, Kathy Park, Diane Daffner, Cyndi Hayashi-Clark, Beth Hall, Sarah Wada, Peggy Berger, and Cheryl Reinhardt. I hope to see another expanded edition in the future, Andrea Siegel has done an excellent job here!

Especially those in the U.S.A. Although most chapters are by no means all inclusive, they offer a good source of basic information relating to the founding and general beliefs of each group. The information is presented in an unbiased way (this is the first comprehensive guide to small religious groups and &quot;cults&quot; not done by a christian group), and includes information on the legal boundaries of religion in the US of A, as well as some past cases involving the exercise of religious freedoms. Most of the book goes over the means and methods of various sundry religious movements, such as the Children of God, American Sikhs, Hebrew Israelites, and so on.This book will make a good addition to any school or library collection, especially since it is not Selling any particular brand of faith, but simply presenting information and allowing the reader to draw conclusions. Anyone with an interest in religion, mind control, sociology or psychology should appreciate the interesting information herein!

This nice, thick volume was renowned Sifu Bucksam Kong's first mass-market book on Hung Gar style, which was later followed by the more advanced Tiger Crane Book. Originally published in the 1970's and having gone through a 10-year period of being out of print and hard to obtain, this volume has recently been reissued by the publisher with a colorful new cover. The timeless "meat" in the pages between the covers is still the same, however!Hung Gar Gung Fu combines strength with speed and often inpressive low stances reminicrent og Goju Ryu. This volume includes complete instruction on the basics of this style, from vital points, stance work, striking, kicking, and deflecting, to the first form, the Two-Man Sparring Set. A superb and complete introduction to Hung Gar style. Bucksam Kong is one of the foremost authorities on this style, and has also published a number of DVDs which detail the Hung Gar and Lau Gar schools.You will find older editions of this book with the original bright gold cover/

Woo Jin Jung offers a complete portrait of who he is today and how he became. Perhaps better known as one of the founders of the magazine "Tae Kwon Do Times", Jung's life weaves a fascinating path from his youth as a farmer in rural Korea, adolescence as an industrial school student in the big city and introduction to Tae Kwon Do. Throughout, Jung is honest about events and his emotions. He doesn't fall into the trap many Korean Martial Arts idealists have set for themselves by trying to present himself as a (near) perfect mini-god. Jung deals with life's complicated problems, lives through the Japanese occupation, Korean War, goes off to fight in Vietnam with the Korean Army and is wounded...throughout he maintaines a love of the martial arts tae kwon do. He tells the truth about misdeeds and shares the keys to successes through his war days to his immigration ot the United States in 1971.What I found fascinating was how hard this man worked throughout, and how willing he was to credit others who helped him along the way. From his childhood trying to earn enough tuition for higher learning to his days as a novice fitness center owner, Jung simply never gave in. When defeat knocked on his door, he would try everything to stave it off...but I won't give anything else away! As a history buff, I missed the dates and more specifics about Taekwondo during this period. That is my only complaint! In a literary world where there are few books by Korean immigrants, and a gross scarcity of autobiographical works by Korean martial artists, this book is enjoyable, and certainly worth obtaining and reading.

A superb introduction to Ed Parker's American Kenpo Karate, this manual covers basic techniques in Part I, and in Part II the first (original) 62 maneuvers required for promotion to 2nd brown tip white belt--that is, before the introduction of belts other than white, brown and black. Remember this volume was written in 1960.This was Parker's first book, and it stands out from what little was available at the time for its straightforward explanations and crisp, clear drawings and photographs. Each sequence is completely explained and illustrated with written instruction and photos--on average each technique (series) is shown in 3-5 photos which include precise arrows illustrating the path of movement.Even in 1960, you can see the intellectual side of Parker's American Kenpo, as he covers topics such as the "Importance of Speed", the "Importance of Maneuvering", and the "Importance of Integrating Speed, Power, Accuracy and Gauging of Distance" (page73-74). Already Parker was making use of organizational charts for anatomical points, method and effect of attack. (pages 58-65).For the history buffs among us, Acknowledgements are given by Parker on the copyright page to several of the early men of Kanpo Karate, including Ben Otake, William Ingram, Robert Liddle, Tim Trahan, Charles Pranke, and Rich Montgomery. Parker and several early students (Including two of the Tracy brothers of Tracy's Kenpo fame among them) take turns demonstrating techniques, with Parker alternating between Tori (demonstrator) and Uke (assistant). Of special value to those with an interest in Karate and Kenpo history in the United States.

For religious believers, here is David Mills' helpful guide to understanding non-believers. For non-believers, this volume serves as a quick reference for those common questions and statements so many of us hear from family, friends and co-workers who always seem to have Jesus For Sale. Not buying? This handy guide sums up many of the basic concepts Atheists, Agnostics & Freethinkers hold, explains why we don't simply accept someone else's blind faith, and shows that areligious does not mean amoral. This guide is also perfect for the individual who is tired of the seeker scene and leans towards rational thought.Atheist philosophy in a nutshell--succinct and factual explanations of why Atheists don't believe in God(s) or the supernatural. Examines such concepts as evolution v. creationism, debunking of popular myths like "America is a Christian nation", Shroud of Turin, prophecy, etc! Also answers to common questions such as "don't you believe in ANYTHING?" (that one gets old!).It is also nice to see Mills take apart the idea that religion and morality necessarily have anything to do with one another, and confront the erroneous idea some believers have that lack of belief in religion or God equates to lack of goodness in general. Atheists do good deeds because we care about others, not because we expect a reward down the road. You won't find an Atheist worrying about an afterlife, and for all the accusations against non-believers, you'll rarely find an Atheist in Prison.This volume also acknowledges that many Atheists do not feel like they have to search or seek some "higher" or "greater" power. After all,what's wrong with nature, or trying to make the world around you a better place for the next generation? Non-believers in a human light, it is shown that Atheists have most of the same hopes and fears as believers--we want our kids to be safe and happy, we enjoy a nice sunrise, we hate paying 3.00+ a gallon for gas, too. Like diversity among believers, Atheists and Infidels come in all varieties, have a wide range of diverging views on a number of topics, and try to make the most of life while enjoying it.The perfect return gift for those folks in our lives who are always passing out New Testaments, Qurans, or the Book of Mormon! ;)

First of a two-volume series by Michael Staples on Northern Chinese Gung Fu. This is one of the rare Tibetan Lama styles of boxing contained in Hop Gar system. This book contains a lot of history and explains many of the popular legends of Kung fu, including the Legend of the Eighteen Buddhas (Arhants). Numerous pictures and drawings throughout.Northern boxing tends to have bigger movements, not as compact as say, Wing Chun. There is good reason to believe this is related to the inclusion of Chin-na, or seizing and grappling techniques contained in the forms.Instruction on footwork and stepping, Chinese Medicine, Chi, and a Tibeten Kung Fu form in Chapter 5 demonstrating the Lama Horse riding stance set. At the back of the book is a Glossary and an appendix explaining the ranking system in chinese kung fu. This book is followed by a second volume called Hop-Gar Kung Fu, by the same author.

Sue Monk Kidd has composed a tale which includes elements of danger, discovery, and sisterhood. It is of course, a story, a fantasy. Set in South Carolina of 1964, orphaned Lily is our protagonist and narrator, pulling the story of her Mother's past together through memories, experience, and eavesdropped bits of conversation gleaned over the hydrangea bushes.Lily details her life learning the craft of beekeeping with three Black sisters in Tiburon, South Carolina and her passage from girlhood to womanhood in the midst of a United States struggling with its own racial identity. A well-constructed novel with a plot worth following, the bees and their honey serve as a metaphore for life lived and the stings and sweetness Lily and her adoptive sisters experience along the way. This is one of the better works of fiction I've chanced to read lately. Monk Kidd's style flows well, and I'm eager to see her other work.

Author Greg Jones presents the style of Jimmy Woo (not to be confused with James Wing Woo) in a practical and complete light. A brief history of Jimmy Woo's San Soo Kung Fu is offered, with indepth handling of topics such as striking, leverage, balance, etc. There is a lot of writing in this book, it is not a picture how-to book. You will find a detailed explanation of how to understand why these methods work. Jones offers detailed reasoning behind all of the major theories of San Soo, and professionally shot photos give examples which help explain concepts. Jimmy Woo's San Soo is a descendent of Choi Li Fut kung fu, stripped down to its most practical elements. Woo was a strong believer in using what was effective and winning the battle without delay. Jones does an excellent job of explaining that message to those of us who haven't studied Woo's San Soo Kung Fu but would like to understand the concepts of the art and gain an insight into how a fighter and survivor like Jimmy Woo thought.

Author Radford Davis (who prefers the multicultural nom-de-plume Ashida Kim for PC reasons), is one of the fewer than 600 American men who, as teens, managed to find authentic secret ninja teachers here in the United States. Apparently during the late 1970's and '80's hundreds of Ninja from the Koga district of Japan flooded the United States to try out for parts in various ninja films and television programs. Hollywood being as cutthroat as it is (and was then, let me tell you!), most of these Ninja had to go out and take non-ninja jobs while waiting for calls from their agents which, sadly, never came. Imagine if you will the ninja fast-food worker, the ninja landscaper, the ninja janitor, the ninja waiter. It couldn't have been easy! Many of them had to overcome discrimination because of their preferred cultural mode of dress (ninja costume). A rather sad testiment to our modern so-called "inclusive" society, indeed!Thankfully, a good number of these undocumented Ninja immigrants were able to find work as Secret Teachers to teenage boys in the United States, who they carefully groomed as their protegees. As with Radford Davis's Secret Teacher, they eventually disapeared when their youthful charge has mastered the elements of ninja-craft. In true ninja fashion, to date none of these Secret Teachers have left a trace, not a photograph, document or family member...no change of address on file with the post office. It's secret stuff this ninja business, I tell you! Many of the authentic Koga Ninja techniques in this book are artfully disguised as modern neo-kenpo, and much of the theory presented here is surprisingly in line with that presented in respected documentaries such as the "American Ninja" series. This in and of itself screams, "AUTHENTICITY!".The author mixes in some kung fu mythology and modern kenpo techniques, along with some materials plageri--...er, borrowed from Stephen K Hayes ninja books (see Hayes 6 volume series). Davis/Kim doesn't seem to know much about the ~ACTUAL~ history of either Japan or Ninja, but if you enjoy seeing grown men dressed up as ninjas and striking stealthy poses in wide open spaces behind oblivious guard-sentry-dudes, this is the book for you!It is not known what became of Radford Davis's teacher. ONLY 2 STARS because he's EXPOSED the ~SECRETS~ of the *NINJA*, which will undoubtedly impact the market (AGAIN) and put a whole lot of Koga Ninja out of work (*AGAIN*) and back behind the counter of venues as vaunted as Taco Bell and The Krusty Krab (move over Spongebob!). Who needs a secret teacher after all, when you can learn to be a ninja from a book?Happy Stealthing! ;)

An excellent introduction to one of the most uncredited training tools of budo and bujutsu, the Bokken (pronounce bow-ken), or wooden sword. Author Dave Lowry is a dedicated practitioner of Japanese martial arts and culture, the perfect person to explain the history, usefulness, and general merits of the Bokken, an implement which is commonly used in Aikido as well as many Kory (pre-Meiji martial arts schools) in Japan for a variety of training and partner exercises.I suppose Lowry could have made another book on Iaito with a live-blade sword, or otherwise spiced up his book with tall tales to sell better to teenage mutant ninjas...thank goodness he avoided the norm and instead presented thoughtful material a generation of serious budoka can appreciate. As Lowry observes concerning the joys of training and appreciation of heritage for the dedicated budoka of any art who takes up this practice:"Certainly one of the most fascinating and rewarding lies in Suburi...with the wooden sword, or Bokken. True, the student of suburi used this practice weapon instead of a live sword (katana) and the movements are not so clearly lethal as those of the feudal warrior's art, but with his bokken, the modern budoka may train on two important levels. On one, he builds the physical stamina, body rythms and adroit body movements of traditional swordsmanship. On the other he achieves something f the animating spirit of the traditional swordsman. He is, through the refinement of his practice, linked in a very real way to his past, for it is through the principles of his swordsmanship that the budo of today have based their teachings, no matter what their present form". (page 13)That Lowry's earlier works tend to be technical instructional manuals (his other early book "Jo: the Art of the Japanese Short Staff" is also recommended) while his later books delve deeper into sharing his life philosophy through personal experiences and observations is worthwhile noting as well. I know of no better teaching tool than to teach through example, sharing a thought, a technique or a story.In my time, "Bokken: Art of the Japanese Sword" has garnered the appreciation of experienced and aspiring Kendo-ka, Aikido-ka, Budo-ka, and simple individuals who have decided that mastering a discipline would enrich their lives. Those who practice bokken don't expect to become kenshi: we simply do with appreciation. Thank You Mr. Lowry!As an aside, also the perfect accompanyment to the wooden suburi or bokken you give your kid for the holiday or birthday when you don't think s/he's _quite_ ready for a live blade yet :)

If you thought that Islam was just a bunch of fellows in white thobes and headdresses running anround oppressing people, this fun and educational little book will help expand your horizons! Another truely excellent title put out by City Lights Books, author Peter Lamborn Wilson covers some of the more...colorful patches in the tapestry of Islam. This book deals with Muslim Thinkers who for one reason or 'tother, are generally considered heretics by many of the larger sects of Islam. We are privalleged to meet Ibn Arabi and the Noble Drew Ali, and delve into subjects such as Satanism in Islam, sexuality and authority in Sufism, and more. The volume includes poems and enjoyable illustrations, photos, and calligraphy throughout.As a note to anyone with a specific interest in African-American religious figures in U.S. history, the essay "Lost/Found Moorish Time Lines: In the Wilderness of North America", Wilson offers what may be the best essay to date in ANY publication, on the Noble Drew Ali and the Moorish Science Temple of America. Included is information about the relationship between the Moorish Science Temple, and Elijah Muhammed, who founded the Nation of Islam. Lots of NEW information in this essay alone, as with the others in this book...did you know about the connection between Islam, Masonry, Shriners, and Moorish Science? Wilson includes footnotes and references with his work, and there is a complete bibliography at the end of this volume.The tone of this book is scholarly, it is by no means a sordid "tell all" work. You won't find proselytizing or propaganda in this volume. If you're tired of the same old repetitive drivel from the same old droning finger-wagging sources, give this book a read. I suspect you will appreciate the time you spend while journeying through its pages.

A Gutsy book I'm glad I took the time to read. Sam Harris dares to question what others have been quietly stepping around for so long--Faith. Using reason and careful throught, Harris examines the dangers of faith unchecked. He demonstrates how faith-based intangible concepts such as promises of big rewards in the afterlife for doing things such as blowing up buildings and killing people who oppose certain views can have a chilling effect on the freedoms of all. Harris dares questions the free pass faith gets when it comes to scrutiny and reason.Perhaps it is a symptom of political correctness that our leaders won't confront the issue of dogma-inspired violence and faith-based fatalities. Harris doesn't accept the vapid excuses from mealy-mouthed spokes-holes, and asks why faith shouldn't be subject to the same rational scrutiny as any other subject. Why should rational people suspend good judgement and remain silent when others use the personal refuge of religious belief to justify poiltics, power grabs and violence? It should say enough that in an age where we can send people into space and combat a vast array of maladies with medical science, there are still people who can be easily whipped into a frenzy of violence by something as insubstantial as cartoons they don't like.A runaway train is a danger to a few, runaway faith may spell the doom of civilization. Now is the time for this book. Passiveness in the guise of respect isn't going to stop madmen from taking out innocent folks and imposing tyranny based on literal religious interpretations. It's time to reinstate the Age of Reason. Critical thought is the first step in that direction.

Hiatt's talent is obvious from the first song all the way through this CD. His songwork contains elements of blues, western, and folk, and wouldn't be out of place in a country music line up (if only local radio stations would feel that way...I guess new-age honkey-tonk is pushing everything else to the side for now). If you're a folk or blues fan, or lament the decline of western folk, give this CD a try. I found it both uplifting and soulful.

If you liked Thomas's &quot;Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit&quot;, you will like this volume as well. Here is a book which offers not only a thourough look at who Bruce Lee was (strengths and weaknesses), but for the first time offers a tangible rethinking of the cause of his untimely death. Since the early 1970's when Bruce Lee died, medicine has come a long way. Bleeker has researched the matter thouroughly, offering several rational theories about what may have contributed to the death of the &quot;Little Dragon&quot; and his own tangible theory for the cause. Thankfully, this volume stays far away from the fanciful thinking of those who posit tenuous tales of triad assasinations or poisoned cocktails, examining instead substances that Lee was known to have taken (Cortazone shots for his back pain, ingesting hashish to relax and alleviate pain, the possibility he may have taken anabolic steroids, the dreaded equagesic tablet at his mistresses' house), and presenting new information on the negative effects and interactions of those substances. You will definately learn something new, as I did. Bleeker also backs up his sources, even naming the man from whom it is thought Lee obtained his hashish and steroids (the man was a documented dealer...go figure).People intent on believing in Bruce Lee as an eternal and perfect diety aren't going to like this book, it definately does not toe the &quot;party line&quot; according to Linda Lee, who stands to profit the most from the myth of Lee as a near-perfect man and martial artist. Practicing martial artists, celebrity trivia buffs, true crime fans and anyone looking for a unique read should enjoy this work immensely. Bleeker is honest about his past relationships with Bruce Lee (he was a one time student), Linda Lee (Once her husband), and his words have been written with an air of driven sincerity, which appears to be led by his own desire to know the facts about this fascinating actor and man.I noted with surprise that Bleeker mentions Linda Lee and Raymond Chow acted separately to legally block publication of this book. Since the threats have not been followed up, I can only guess that they were unsubstantive, and issued in hope of intimidating Tom Bleeker into silence. I for one am glad he decided to share what he discovered with the rest of us who haven't the time or connections to take personally researching this topic on.

A good variety and collection of books which, for whatever reason, were excluded by the early Church councils from what became the Old Testament and New Testament.Initially published as a group in 1926, each one of the "Lost Books" includes a brief introduction giving background and history. Like the editors of this two-part volume, I do not feel it is necessary to share my opinion of the historicity of these works, each reader can decide for him or herself what is shadow and what is worthy in his own esteem, and consider the debate which at one time engulfed some of these books.This volume is divided into two sections. The first is called "Lost Books of the Bible", and includes works which deal with Jesus & Company, and may at one time have been considered part of the New Testament Gospel in various bishoprics (prioe to successive Councils and later the establishment of Roman and other Orthodox sects). Includes are the following 26 "lost" books:Mary, Protevangelion, I. Infancy, II. Infancy, Christ and Abgarus, Nicodemus, The Apostles' Creed, Laodiceans, Paul and Senica, Paul and Thecla, I. Clement, II. Clement, Barnabus, Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, Polycarp, Philippians, I. Hermas-Visions, II. Herman-Commands, III. Hermas-Similitudes, Letters of Herod and Pilate, The Last Gospel of PeterThere is even room in the margin for little notes to yourself as you read. I found it helpful to devote a specific portion of time to each chapter and consider its implications, weigh the quality of the writing, etc. This is an interesting window into the formation of Christianity during its first several hundred years. Also, don't miss the book "The Lost Books of Eden", which covers *JEWISH WORKS* :) which were not included in the Canon due to their more recent origin (ONLY about 2,200-2,000 years old).

An interesting, unusual accout of Zen in America. Unusual in its stark honesty and detail, interesting for those same reasons! Michael Downing's book is built around a scandal (sex, greed, power, all of the usual suspects involved) which errupted at the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC) in 1983. Much of the book details the actions of Richard Baker, the only American to receive Dharma Transmission (often called Enlightenment) from noted Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki. Quite a bit of other material is covered as well, presenting a full picture of life and relations at perhaps the most successful Zen organization in the West.In presenting events in their historical context, Downing explains the structure of the Zen Buddhist Sangha (church), history of Shunryu Suzuki and many of the early pioneers who first explored Zen Buddhism in San Fransisco after Suzuki began to teach. Reading this book over the course of a week, I didn't get the feeling that Downing took on this project to do damage to adherents to Zen or the SFZC. Rather his mission seems to have been to figure out exactly what had happened to cause the 1983 melt down (it was actually a long time festering before it broke and Downing sets the stage completely), how such a thing could happen in an organization where one of the main principles was to Cause No Harm, and then exploring why it happened with a critical eye towards absolute power and some of the more traditional processes.I liked the detail Downing exacted throughout, introducing the vast array of real-life characters who were part of "The Scene" during the 1960's and 1970's in California and nationally. He does a superb job connecting the relationship web between people. So many folks are covered sometimes I had to flip back to remind myself--it does jump around a bit, but I couldn't think of any other way to present a series of connected events like this. Downing also does an admireable job of explaining how SFZC grew into such a huge organization. I learned more about the SFZC and its place in history than from many of the other books I've read about Buddhism in the West. Certainly I obtained a better understanding of how processes such as Transmission work and relate to the political process inherent in this Zen body politic.While the entire book is certainly not a slanted diatribe, Downing does not claim to be a hands-off Bodhisatva with no opinion. He expresses distaste for a selection of teachers, transmition holders and other claimants to enlightenment who abuse their positions of authority by using and personally profiting from others in a variety of ways. Downing's book demands that the reader confront sexual and financial misconduct and the abuse of trusting disciples. He strips away the varnish of position, money, high titles and robes to expose simple humanity--good, bad and in-between.Downing explains the problem-solving process SFZC went through, and how it regrouped and restructured in response to the problems, and in an effort to prevent future abuses and disasters. There are also a number of accounts of individuals who moved on from the devestation to heal others as well as themselves. I have often heard the phrase that life is stranger than fiction. In this case, it is most certainly true and probably not what most of us have come to expect.

Master stage magicians Penn and Teller take on psychics, astrology, the environment, and a host of other questionable topics. Like the title of the show, Penn and Teller do not hesitate at all in demonstrating that the frauds, con men, and phony scientists are full of Bull Sh*t! Happily, they manage to do it with a unique style and humor that left me snorting Dr. Pepper through my nostrils. Ouch. It was worth it!In the process of watching these programs, you will learn exactly -how- frauds and fakers pull of many of their stunts, -why- certain pseudoscientists and pseudo historians are wrong, and even -why- people are often so eager to believe and accept things at face value. While our prestidigitationator hosts are opinionated, they are always on the side of the common man (us) who so often plays the dupe to the frauds of our day.These programs are entertainment and education rolled into one. I am not the sort of person who usually buys dvds of every series I like. This series was warrented though, and long overdue...Penn and Teller have proven themselves worthy of a place on any skeptic's shelf. Enjoy!

Written shortly after Dave Lowry's second book, "Bokken", "Jo" follows closely in style with detailed explanations and good explanatory sequence photographs. Of all the training tools one might add to one's repetoire, Jo has got to be the best for a variety of reason. The Jo is balanced and relatively easy to get a feel for. Another big plus from an experienced traveller (me)--the Jo can double as a walking stick, and it isn't difficult to bring with you for training just about anywhere you go.I enjoy reading Lowry's books, he is knowledgeable and earnest, two traits I can appreciate in anyone, but especially seek in a teacher. In this work he explains the purpose, advises the studious reader not to assume too much, and offers sage advice along with instruction. Lowry compares and contrasts the ancient and modern Bugeisha (man or warrior ways) and offers us consideration on the motives of each:"...the single distinction between the classical bugeisha and his counterpart may be measured in terms of spirit. For the bugeisha, training was not a matter of spending a few hours a week polishing his craft. He entered into it as a lifelong pursuit. He maintained a steadily receptive frame of mind, constabtly instilling within himself an atitude of alertness, incessantly assessing and evaluating situations and reacting accordingly. For him the physical confrontations of the dojo also imparted lessons in personal comportment that could be, and were, applied to daily life. The strategy of the classical martial arts was therefore mirrored in his manners and in the way he conducted himself in society". (page 18)Lowry also offers a brief history of Jojutsu and its evolutin to Jodo before commencing an excellent series of instructional photo sequences. If you're reading this you probably have some martial arts experience and already understand--but just in case, I should point out that it is very difficult for an individual with absolutely NO prior weapons experience to pick up the nuances of weapons training from a book. If you live in a place or under conditions that make finding an instructor or training partner virtually impossible, I'd recommend getting a dvd or watching some clips to get an idea of HOW to move and beginning correspondence with a legitimate instructor who will have your best interests at heart. Sincere practice can be tough mentally and physically, especially in the beginning--so focus your attention, don't give up, and appreciate everything that is right with the world.

I first read about Tonie Harris years ago in Valerie Eads volume, "Women in the Martial Arts: A New Spirit Rising" (1983). I was impressed by Tonie's story of survival despite desparate circumstances, her willingness to improve herself through martial arts. Tonie Harris was a mixed martial artist before most people knew what the term meant, going out of her way to study a number of other arts, including wrestling.So when I saw this newer volume, curiosity led me to read and consider this book. Most of the portions in "The Dark Side of Karate" concerning Tonie Harris-Gaitlin's martial arts days are lifted from her dialogue in "Women in the Martial Arts". There was some new biographical information, including her suffering at the hands of a sexually abusive grandfather as a girl. Tonie also describes her involvement in a lesbian relationships while being involved with a women's martial arts organization, and the control issues related to it. She discusses her agression, attitudes towards family members, etc.Then, Tonie attempts to tie together all of her failings by linking them to...the martial arts. Violence and aggression? Martial arts made me do it. Lesbianism? Martial arts made me do it. Disrespect and neglect for family, bad relationship choices, abusive behavior? Yes, you guessed it--The "demon" martial arts are to blame. The martial arts serve as the catch-all scape goat. Tonie is never able to come straight out and take responsibility for her bad life choices. Instead, she uses her embrace of Christianity--and subsequent rejection of ALL martial arts practice--as an outlet which conveniently lets her off the hook.There are too many smart and stable Christians --and non-Christians-- practicing martial arts today who can recognize the mistake Tonie Harris has made in rejecting something good because she has chosen to cast the reflection of her own bad choices and experiences upon it. Reading the book, it's clear to me that the "demons" in Tonie's life were brought about through her own actions.Harris's choiced had little if anything to do with martial arts themselves, and more to do with the ~mind of the practitioner herself~ and how Tonie CHOSE to react to them at the time. In hindsight, it seems it was easier for Tonie to craft a world of scary demon-dragons that forced her to commit unethical or distasteful deeds to explain and EVADE RESPONSIBILITY for her past actions. It would be more honest to just admit her past flaws and move on. That Tonie has come to abhore aggression and violence in any form may better explain her evolved views of the martial arts as something she doesn't need and won't teach. To call her _rejection_ of martial arts "Christian" is another thing altogether!Today's Tonie Harris-Gatlin sounds like a woman dedicated to her community, firm in her faith, and happy with her life. This is terrific! But playing the BLAME GAME with karate and other martial arts, which have for years given people a healthy outlet for agression, a mode to physical fitness and mental discipline, sells these practices short. Most modern teachers do not force students to practice religious aspects. Tonie's stunted view of martial arts as demonic, evil, un-Christian is one which has been debated in the fundamentalist Christian community for years, and will probably not disappear any time soon.True believers who already hold Harris-Gatlin's view of all martial arts as irreconcileably evil may enjoy this short book. Honest people, Christian or not, martial artist or not, will have no problem SEEING THROUGH the veil Tonie has put up in the confines of this little volume.

Here is the original English language BIG Tang Soo Do Book. Tang Soo Do is one of the terms used to describe the modern Korean fighting art containing elements of Native Korean Taek Kyun (most noticeable in the kicking techniques) as well as Japanese Karate (evident in stance, punching, and Hyung/forms). Older first print editions of this book have Black dustcovers with the title "Tang Soo Do (Soo Bahk Do)" and a picture of two men, one demonstrating a flying side kick, the other preparing to evade it. Later editions have a dark blue cover with the Moo Duk Kwan logo and the title "Soo Bahk Do (Tang Soo Do)". However both books have the same content.Moo Duk Kwan Founder Hwang Kee established the Moo Duk Kwan school, one of 9 original Kwan or schools of martial art influenced by Japanese Karate and established in Korea during and just after World War II. Hwang's book is still noteable as it was THE first volume to reprint entirely the older military empty-hand fighting arts book "Moo Yei Do Bo Tong Ji" dating back to times when China still had a noteable cultural influence (MYDBTJ was written by a Chinese general). Although Hwang does not offer a complete translation in either this English work or his Korean books, at last people have the opportunity to see one of the sources of inspiration for Korean martial artists who were looking for sources outside the scope of Japanese martial arts to minimize the shame many felt after the terrible period of oppression Koreans suffered at the hands of Imperial Japan between 1900 and the close of World War II.The section on history is honest although by our standards dated. Hwang mentions the relation between Okinawan and Japanese Karate, and early Korean Tang Soo Do and Tae Kwon Do. Unlike later authors who endeavored to hide the fact of this relationship by offering up phony revisionist histories (or just not connecting the dots), Hwang even credits the Hyung practiced in Moo Duk Kwan Tang Soo Do to their appropriate Okinawan teachers, at least as far as was known in his age. Readers will find some of the phonetic translations differ in spelling from what we are used to...Okinawa's Itosu is referred to as "Mr. Idos" (pg 20,372), Higasionna is really not that far off from Higashionna (p 20), and Funakoshi is referred to as Humakoshy (20), simple phonetic differences due to the lack of an "f" sound in the Korean dialect. The simple truth admitted by Hwang Kee himself in "The History of Moo Duk Kwan" is that he read Japanese Karate manuals which were available to railway workers at the time--certainly NOT his only source, but it explains the presence of hyung from Okinawa and Japan.There are decent sections on Philosophy, History, Practical study (one would be better served to get anything by Martina Sprague to understand physics and martial arts), Application of technique to include Stances, Principles of Basic Movement covering hand and foot techniques, and a section on Forms, or Hyung which includes the 9 basic forms most schools utilize for promotion to Cho-dan (first degree Dark Blue or Black belt) or Cho-dan Bo (candidate for first degree). Forms include the three original basic Ki Cho Hyung Ill-Bu, Ee-Bu & Sam-Bu, and the five intermediate Pyung Ahn forms, Cho-dan, Ee-dan, sam-dan, Sa-dan, and Oh-dan, and also Bassai hyung.Many of the forms and techniques are demonstrated by Hwang Kee's Son, Hwang Hyun-chul. Later editions of this book have been reprinted by the United States Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation. Also available are a series of four learning books with gup-belt specific material in them, including required self defense and sparring sequences, vocabulary, and hyung (including the newer hyung created by Grandmaster Hwang not covered in this book such as the Chil Sun, Yuk Ro, and Hwa Rang series). USSBDMDKF has also published a worthwhile book discussing the history of Kwan founder Hwang Kee, and a second book on Dan-level hyung.There are a number of fair books by other notable Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan practitioners which are similar in structure to this volume. Students of those teachers will undoubtedly be encouraged to purchase their teacher's works--and they should. But don't lose sight of the man who started the Moo Duk Kwan in the first place! He is present throughout this book.

Javier Martinez has worked hard to re-introduce grappling into the bunkai of the Isshinryu version of Chinto Kata. His basis: research into original Chinese applications of forms, many of which have been ignored or forgotten. I recommend this volume for anyone with a base in Japanese or Okinawan karate, this is not simply one man's favorite way to do something, and not another guide on striking alone. Nor need one be a student of Isshinryu to understand and assimilate the ideas conveyed here (I'm not). Martinez's methods are practical and sensible. This volume is 56 pages long, shows Isshinryu Chinto in 57 moves, and includes 12 Bunkai (applications). It is a fact that most of the deveolped Chinese martial arts taught striking as a precursor to locking and throwing (Shuai Chiao master Cheng Tung-sheng emphasized this as well). At no time does he suggest having all of the answers--the bunkai shown are the results of his efforts. Martinez has done his homework, and this brief and direct work does deserve our attention.

Yes, there are some gramatical errors in this book. Of course, it is an instructional manual and not a literary offering. The author's verbage did not inhibit my ability to understand what he was explaining. Martinez is a native of Puerto Rico whose karate background is Isshin-ryu.Isshin-ryu includes 8 empty-hand kata: Seisan, Seiunchin, Naihanchi, Wanso, Chinto, Kusanku, Sanchin, and the kata designed by the style's founder, Tatsuo Shimabuku, Sunsu. The first six kata mentioned in the last sentence are covered in this book (Sanchin and Sunsu are not), with complete demonstrations of each application offered in clearly understandable line drawings.Martinez's approach is instructional. He offers some information on Okinawan karate history, and offers a hypothesis on how tuite (&quot;grappling&quot;) lies at the heart of what many of us thought, until recently, were striking arts. Kata is the main teaching tool, and Martinez unravels what for all intents and purposes may have been encoded kata. His theory is convincing, his methodology logical.Martinez has also written four other books (booklets really--about 50-60 pages each, nicely printed and covered) on kata bunkai (form applications), covering kata Naihanchi, Chinto, Kusanku, and Seiunchin. The difference between this volume and the others is that the four kata booklets demonstrate with photographs instead of drawings, and include the demonstration of the kata by the author, and then the section on bunkai (application). This volume on tuite does not show the one-man kata sequences. While the booklets are more thorough in their treatment of technical details (not so markedly so that you'd &quot;have&quot; to buy them if you already know the kata), the visual detail of the line drawings in this book are easier to discern, especially with relation to hand placement.In this book, Martinez also deals in great detail with different methods of punching, twisting, and body movement before he begins to deal with the 6 kata of the book (pages 1-78). The rest deals with a breakdown of the applications for the six kata: Seisan, Seiunchin, Naihanchi, Wanso, Chinto, Kusanku (pages 79-200).This is a terrific book, and does a lot to dispell the myth that Okinawan arts are primative and limited to striking alone. Then again I suppose primative vs. technologically advanced has more to do with how much study a person is willing to put into studying their chosen discipline.

Although as another reviewer notes there are some problems with this translation, Muenori's book is a superb work of strategy that belongs right next to Musashi Miyamoto's Go Rin No Sho (book of five spheres) and Yamamoto Kansuke's Heiho Okugisho. Where there were illustrations in the original Heiho Kadensho (Family transmission scroll), they are here reproduced for the reader's benefit.The Sword and The Mind illuminates not only a philosophy for fighting and survival, but a way of being and considering life. Truely a work of Genius! This translation is generally straight forward and easy to understand, and includes a bibliography as well as a glossary of terms. Unfortunately, there are not a number of translations of this work to choose from and compare yet. A decent work worthy of consideration.

Although this 102 page volume purports to be a translation of a 12th century manuscript written by a man called Hidetomo Nakadai for Japan's first Shogun, Minamoto Yoritomo (who in fact DID exist), it is in fact a fictional work penned by Stephen Kaufman. A man who admittedly does not speak Japanese and has no academic background to speak of, Kaufman would certainly be an unlikely candidate to &quot;discover&quot; a Japanese manuscript which has been &quot;lost&quot; for 800 years--and somehow present it to us in English. The fact is that no such person as Hidetomo Nakadai existed. There is no historical work called &quot;Shogun no Rin&quot; (&quot;Shogun Scrolls&quot;). Author Stephen Kaufman is also known through his previous two books as someone who does not mind altering ACTUAL historical documents in an effort to get them to conform to his desired meaning (he has done this with Musashi's &quot;Book of Five Rings&quot; as well as Sun Tsu's &quot;Art of War&quot;). He also tends towards the ignorant, referring to both Minamoto and Hidetake by their first names, a blooper nobody who'd taken a year of Japanese history or language would commit.As there are a number of true century-old documents which offer advice on bushido to warriors and leaders and have been translated into English and are also much more thorough in scope and clearer in context (&quot;Hagukure&quot; and &quot;Budoshoshinshu&quot; come to mind), I fail to see why Kaufman crafted this spurious work in the first place! In his introduction, he mentions Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot;, (page viii) which suggests that this book of his may have been inspired by that work (I am inclined to believe this is his creative interpretation of that book). Kaufman also admits that &quot;As a working philosopher and motivation lecturer, I am not interested in actual historical events...&quot; (page viii). Nonetheless, Stephen Kaufman is NOT clear about the veracity of this book, never once warning the reader that this is not a work of fact, but an imaginative fictitious hodgepodge concocted by his active imagination and incomplete knowledge of Japanese history.Generally, there is a belief common among martial artists (and others) that people should conduct themselves honorably. This includes being truthful and honest--NOT being misleading. There are undoubtedly a number of well-meaning people who in seeking an education in Budo, have stumbled upon Kaufman's book &quot;The Shogun Scrolls&quot; and trusting the author's words, taken them as historical fact. Whatever Kaufman's motivation in doing this, I cannot believe his intentions were good. What a pity that Kaufman couldn't present his own honest philosophical views, in a straightforward manner and in his own words, perhaps using actual historical events as his base. If only he could banish his ego to impart wisdom to his readers rather than leaving them misguided, ignorant, annoyed and confused.
