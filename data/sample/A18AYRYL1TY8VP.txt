One of only a handful of perfect movies. Sidney Poitier as Homer Smith gives a life-sustaining performance that will last forever. Director Ralph Nelson's vision brings to mind O'Keeffe's paintings and Martha Graham's ecstatic American ballets, so beautifully directed is this piece. Every inch of film pays homage to the great American desert. A constant visual starkness makes the rich, inviting heart of the film only riper and wiser than it otherwise would be. Frame by frame, with prodigal ease, Lilies of the Field offers nothing less than the full blown promise of everything American cinema could have become since 1963, but which, with few exceptions, failed to materialize, corporate fantasies supplanting cinematic art. The notable lineage of the great independent films can be traced to this one masterpiece, and to this day every actor can only raise his or her own art by watching Poitier incarnate Homer Smith with a jewelsmith's love and attention that can unstop your heart. You can watch this movie a hundred times and be only glad. Its hope is ineradicable, and its truth unnegotiable. You need to own a copy. DVD transfer quality is exceptional throughout.

This 70s Brit series' take on the peril of empire remains a lodestar of the genre. Filmed with the still unrivaled toxic television color film of the period (almost no color at all, creating a realist grit that modern filmmakers can only dream about) and featuring a young Roy Marsden as Neil Burnside, head of Special Section, chief of his three (sometimes two) beloved Sandbaggers - this is way more than a tv series. Its verismo cool induces the keen euphoria of addiction. The series relies on fine writing, with each succeeding episode upping the ante, and Marsden's diamond intensity. The sets are beyond spare, and the prop telephones ring at volumes to blast your brains. The red phone on Burnside's desk becomes a familiar extra character in every episode. Marsden is mesmerizing. His foibles are dark, his life is a secret. He falls in love with Sandbagger Laura Dickens, and by episode's end sees her shot dead on an East Berlin bridge in a prisoner swap - by a CIA agent, from a building inside East Berlin. It's one of the best episodes in a consummately taut series that exudes grit and conscience. Alan MacNaughton ("To Serve Them All My Days") as Wellingham gives Marsden a run for his money whenever he's on screen. Brilliant stuff. I own the dvd set, and suggest you're impoverished if you don't. If you're a fan of 70s British spy drama you already know about Sandbaggers. If not, check in. You won't leave.

A distinctive memoir of life-altering decisions is made utterly interesting by the author's painstaking class act as a writer. All the verve and clear insights of 'A History of God' are here under a more intimate patina. Karen Armstrong's patient English temperament can almost drive you to distraction as she seeks the calling God, but reward for your own patience is found on nearly every page. Surprising is Armstrong's regularly vivid self-criticism, and it's interesting she possesses a post-Christian understanding true enough to keep her at all times from recrimination, toward both the Church and her own decisions. It's a mark of post-cloister spiritual maturity that colors the whole book &amp; makes it a satisfying read on many levels. Armstrong's intelligent economy of thought and language combine with sharp insight and simple English forthrightness to make a winner. You wont be disappointed with Narrow Gate.

A beautiful book that ends too soon. Hiding genially underneath a New England scholar's personal spiritual adventure to Mount Athos is a vibrant, penetrating, all-encompassing examination of religion and spirituality. Yet, the book never tires, and only refreshes. Author Markides' sparkling writing is taut and clean, with a seriousness and intelligence palpable on every page. It's a startling journal of a seeker, and offers a surprisingly rare insight into Orthodox mysticism, through the teaching of Father Maximos, lovingly supplanted by the author's genuine experience of discovery. I'm struck again by the fascinating parallels of approach and understanding between mystical Orthodoxy and Buddhism, also apparent in studying the Philokalia. Not to overstate it, although it's touted as an Orthodox book, the depth of understanding that permeates Mountain of Silence gives it a broad appeal across religions, towards the Infinite. It's interesting that the distinct mystical traditions of Judaism, Orthodoxy, and Catholicism forge a spiritual synthesis that mostly escapes finding in church and synagogue, when it's a deeper understanding we most seek; this book goes a long way towards bridging that curious disconnect. Every important element of the author's experience is plumbed and vividly conveyed, riveting, in fact. There seems no superficial way of reading this book, and that indicates an authentic attainment. Mountain of Silence is unexpected and deep, and wisely expressive. Best of all, it's wholly compelling. Radical recommendation, no hesitation.

The CD title is silly, the song titles too for that matter, but this is a great CD. I've listened to it for years. Like a lot of practictioners, silence is the only meditation music for me. I'm sure there are those who like music in the background, who knows. What matters is that the music on this disc sets a standard that's not been equalled in New Age music. Tony Scott's jazz background gives him a rare originality and freedom, and these players find an authentic musical unity in a disc of rare improvisation. Koto master Shinichi Yuize and shakuhachi player Hozan Yamamoto share full measure in making a lasting recording that never tires, and asks nothing it doesnt return ten fold. Once you hear this recording, you'll want it always nearby. It's a real treat.(4/07 note: musician Tony Scott passed away last month. THANKS for a great CD, Tony!)

I first encountered this book over forty years ago. If Joseph Zacchello ever was in reality a Catholic priest, he evidently paid scant attention to his seminary lessons. Unlike today, back in the day of Zacchello the Seminarian the Catholic Church actually taught Roman Catholic doctrine in its seminaries, witness the exponential growth of the Church in America and elsewhere during the reign of Pius XII, a fact rebuking the lamentable post-Conciliar record. Zacchello's ignorance with respect to the doctrine and customs of the Roman Church is embarassing. An example: use of the ancient ecclesiastical custom of speaking of the Roman Pontiff as 'Our Most Holy Lord the Pope' is construed by Zacchello as proof that Catholics believe the pope is God Himself. This kind of illiteracy is barbarism, and the book is filled with it. Its hatreds and lies are violent, even disturbing. The author spits rather than writes, and never more disturbingly than in the vitriol he concocts against the historical mother of Jesus. Polemics, after all, has standards; even the most convinced anti-Catholic person will find nothing here but the decayed spiritual death of the hater. It is mortifying to know this book is still published and available to the public, while so many valuable worthwhile books are out of print. What a comment on the culture we live in! The only secrets you'll find in this book are those that mock the reader to his moral peril.

Finally on DVD, To Serve Them All My Days is a princely miniseries with a heart of gold. Veteran writer/producer Andrew Davies hit a home run out of the park with a magnificent adaptation of Delderfield's novel of England between wars. John Duttine dominates the series with his portrayal of David Powlett-Jones, in a subtle and winning performance, Frank Middlemass is supercharged as Headmaster Algie Herries, and Alan MacNaughtan rightly steals every scene he's in with a wry, eccentric brilliance. The performances from top to bottom are consistent and wonderfully rich. Delderfield's novel examines the futility of war with exacting subtlety, wisely and articulately focusing on the lives of youths destined for its relentless killing fields, and the adults whose experiences have harvested for them wisdom and courage. Thank God for that, there are few enough intelligent containers of truth in an age of perpetual war. This series could be recommended viewing for young American men and women facing daily the campus scourge of army recruiters and the jingoism of war-for-glory profiteers - I can't think of a better wakeup call. Story, setting, actors, and a first rate literary adaptation combine for an unforgettable experience. One of the best things about this film is the Bamfylde school song sung at the beginning of each episode. Its hypnotic English hymn proportions draw you in each and every time, devotedly preparing you for a rewarding telling of an ageless story. To Serve Them All My Days is perfect filmmaking, and bountiful viewing. High-powered, five-star recommendation.

This is a fine look at Gene Kelly. Some of the footage used is miraculous - the duet of Kelly with Astaire is amazing. The reminiscences from a number of people work well, the pace of interview/footage is well crafted. Some of Kelly's career gets glossed without much attention, but for a 90 min. documentary, this is about as good as it gets. The tone of the piece is never cloying, for all the admiration Kelly engenders, and rightfully so. He was an immense artist. Stanley Tucci narrates, and there's ample enough coverage of his private life, especially with his children, to whet your appetite for more. The presentation of his art is first-rate, even as you want more. Gene Kelly's admirers won't be disappointed.

An excellent documentary about Glass and his music. Lots of music, and beautifully used throughout. Glass is so ordinary a man. Being a person completely present is what makes the ordinary extraordinary, and the same is true of his music. He tackles that transfixion with appealing intelligence, and calm that can dip towards a kind of trance. Watching him work in silence in his study is itself a little temple of the workman; yet the camera's patience with the scene makes appear a pantheon of gods instrumental to the artist's each action. A rich world; you immediately desire his silence and seclusion FOR him. Interesting energy this film emits in that respect - rushing seems out of place. Glass talks about many things artists are interested in - the health of our surroundings, the freedom technique affords, the maverick aspects of business and art - it's like a master class with none of the dull trappings. Generous helpings of music and staging from Akhnaten and Satyagraha, and long-time Glass advocate Dennis Russell Davies plays and conducts the rocketship Tirol Piano Concerto (premiered in Austria in 2000). Beautiful segments on the film scores, notably the Godfrey Reggio trilogy, and footage of installations/films to Glass' music that flat out astonishes! It feels like the film Glass himself would like to find made about his work. He's clear-headed as heck, &it's rewarding. Big recommendation, especially if you already love the music. I wish we had a film this fine about Feldman.

Lucky is any viewer who encounters Flambards! It's one of Masterpiece Theatre's best series ever. Another reviewer did a great job outlining the plot. But this is a cinematic experience that literally blows you away. The scenes of horses on fox hunt, flashing along the fertile countryside with speed and excitement, are beautiful beyond imagination. There's a great, forward sweeping movement to each episode, an Edwardian country grandeur that's irresistible. It's Christina's series, and Christine McKenna never falters in creating the captivating heart of a story not without its ruthlessness. An ever present human sadness tracks the story like a stalker, but one never tires watching; redemption always comes at a price. The aeroplane scenes are as majestic and vital as the ubiquitous horses, and William is the sweet relief to the mongrol aspects of his beleagured family. As fine as it is, I'm convinced this series would be noticably less without its absolutely magnificent music, an essential component from the get go. The theme music alone will live forever! Get this beautifully done DVD version and make a date with forever.

An excellent disc with a tremendous presentation of the First Violin Concerto- Oistrakh is in top singing form from beginning to end! What a player! The thing inside his playing, the man cannot err in phrasing, it really is a miracle! The slow section is wonderfully made, like a glad sorrow, music pulled from that remarkable place inside Shostakovich, like in some of the ballet suites -his heart, I think. This concerto is really high up in Shosty heaven. It's not the most modern atmosphere, if that matters. Like the man says, it's mono, doesn't really matter; Oistrakh was among us to play the violin, and this is true testament. The Cello Concerto pips along, Slava Rostropovich seems a little absent at times. Still, there's fire. In any case, a finer version is Heinrich Schiff's, though I believe it's out of print. But what a marvelous piece! A fired-up reading by Ormandy, close to the bone, just right! Don't hesitate- this beautiful CD's a bargain.

THIS is what I'm talkin about! A fantastic collection with more magnificent playing from Barenboim. The chap's hitting his stride! Having just watched the excellent 2disc '50 Years on Stage', I went looking for more. This is a superb film (6 discs) and Barenboim's Beethoven is wise and abundant - and the film's not just music. Conversation, breezy cutaways, but always returning to the reason for the season, which is Barenboim's musical maturity and his seeming emergence as a revered elder. In the Master Class segments, Barenboim even manages to get Lang Lang to LISTEN more! Young musicians have a great deal to learn from the maestro in this phase of his musical life: learning to lean on music, to trust it, to set aside ego inside one's work, and how to listen as a musician. These pure qualities this pianist possesses in spades. Absolute recommendation. How many times can you hear these sonatas played with this kind of beautiful authority? Dont even think twice. Worth twice the price.

Despite a few cliched moments, the film is smart and stylish, cagily self-conscious, appealing but not mesmerizing, beautiful, but fortunately not gorgeous. Its message is a meditation on the complexion of death as part of life, successfully generating the idea of death as life's beginning. The idea itself rebukes post-modern culture, and the film works hard to engage that. But a disappointing script, and editing which strives for supra noir effect, leaves the impression of a film without real justification except artfulness. Not a bad cause, but one to be considered before purchase. Still, a film 'about' Zen is bound to be captivating especially for Zennists, and perhaps western Buddhists in general. I enjoyed it, but have difficulty recommending it for most viewers even though most of us need the message desperately. The film is darkly hilarious, and yet shallow given the prospects raised by the title's idea. Rosenbush takes an intriguing run with it. How well he fares is a question up for grabs, decided by one's interest in things fanciful and yet strangely intimate. The film's artifice is its magic, and it's often winning, but never transforming. For what it's worth, I'm many years a Zen practitioner.

Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest opera recordings of the twentieth century! The opera itself, here restored to its original form -after metamorphosing into 'Katerina Izmailova', the original libretto (and score) hidden from the world for thirty years- is one of the masterful achievments of Shostakovich's life. Rostropovich has assured himself a high place in the pantheon of artists who have rendered incontestable service to mankind by this recording. Katerina's aria which opens the opera is a remarkable piece of theatre in and of itself, not to mention a perfect preamble of what is to come, and is radiantly sung by Vishnevskaya in full command of her extraordinary gifts, every nuance intact, her intimacy with the role apparent from the outset. The blood of this score is so entirely Russian, and so clearly purchased with that particular life-sacrificing art peculiar to the Russian humanist aesthetic, that its musical language reveals itself straightaway as an organic part of the glorious continuum of Russian art, one of the reasons of course that Stalin chose it to forge his hammer against everything truly Russian. The political history of this work of art, fascinating though it is, yet remains an ignoble and indeed unimportant footnote beside the lasting triumph of this particular opera. Nicolai Gedda here demonstrates why he is a legendary tenor- Sergey's grief, and what remains of his inner life are wrought like gold at every turn; it is a performance of towering artistry and unparalleled beauty. The London Symphony is shocking in its perfection, heated by Rostropovich's mystical gifts and pouring itself out like a Russian lover. Others more learned and capable than I have written far more lucidly than I could hope to in praise of this eternal work of art, yet I wish to call out the majesty of this masterpiece, encourage others to purchase it, make it their own, and thereby give homage to a genuinely rare human experience bequeathed to the world by Shostakovich, here restored to its preeminent place by the irreplaceable artists and collaborators who have understood what this work means to humankind, especially in an age of unbelief.

Vishnevskaya's reputation for forthrightness AND the sub-title she chooses here --A Russian Story-- indicate strong intentions for this book. Not 'MY Russian Story', but 'A Russian Story', because Galina Vishnevskaya tells an epic Russian story, honoring with a severe truth the Russia of sorrows of which her story forms but a unique part. This is no prima donna's idle tableau of a curtained career. Vishnevskaya's art comes of suffering, &amp; she doesn't head down that road. She divulges her art generously, but her attitude never self serves. Her aim is always higher - she's interested to say not only what HAPPENED in Soviet life, but what WAS. and WHO!--- Vishnevskaya regularly excoriates with galvinizing abandon the soviet lackeys with whom she had to deal! She names names and motives, because it's the damned truth! The West in general and artists in particular owe a huge debt to Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya for the willing sacrifice of themselves in exile for the simple truth. Rostropovich garners the commentary in the West with the cello &amp; conducting, but Galina is the heart of genius, and THAT seems the telling component in this book. Her depiction of Solzhenitsyn is heartrending, and stands as the book's axis; everything leads to it, and derives from it. Her friendship with Shostakovich, her brilliant feelings toward him-- an almost daughterly reverence informed by the highest artistic aesthetic. It's also through the part Shostakovich played in her life that we meet a musically learned Galina as well. She was a musician FIRST, singer second. How rare and wonderful - no wonder Slava fell in love! Galina dances with the shadows of Shostakovich throughout, &amp; it's one of the book's endearing aspects. There are wonderful stories too of Britten and his music, &amp; a surprisingly frank exposition of Furtseva, soviet Minister of Culture, whose enigmatic machinations both helped and ill-served Galina more than once. Vishnevskaya can sing AND write! The book ends when you don't want it to, leaving Russia... it's ultimately a love story -- Galina and Russia. Maybe she'll yet write her American story.

This is a magnificent film. Composed in a kind of "three movement" sonata form, it focuses far more on Britten and Pears' personal relationship than does Tony Palmer's superlative film on Britten, "A Time There Was". I don't find the film title here misleading. Much is revealed throughout about Britten's and Pears' love relationship. It's a comprehensive and moving study of their life together revealed deliberatively without pruriance or speculation, with tremendous dignity as both men clearly desired, and indeed as they deserve. Besides offering copious footage of Pears' magnificent singing, something Palmer's effort noticably lacks in measure, the three sections are thoughtful, essential, and charged through with music, each using a specific work of Britten's to tell his story. Comments from friends and intimates, the dowager Countess of Cranbrook and critic John Amis among a select group, are beautifully tailored to match the mood of each segment. The working relationship between Auden and Britten is detailed, including Auden's letters. Director Teresa Griffith's vision and brilliant editing is a worthy manifestation of love for her subject and his music. Segment 2 - the slow movement, as it were - offers a harrowing look at the War Requiem, with original footage of the premiere and vital commentary from Vishnevskaya, who was prevented by Soviet authorities from participating in premiering the music that was written for her. Britten and his music, and indeed Peter Pears, were beloved by the Rostropovichs, and that is beautifully addressed, though no mention is made of the music Britten wrote for Rostropovich. And, goodness, what MUSIC! If you're devoted to the music of Ben Britten, don't miss this film! It's a supremely attractive study of one of the giants of 20th c. music, made with great heart and detail. See my review of Palmer's equally successful Britten venture which focuses more on Britten's own family, including interviews with his sisters. Each in its own way uniquely illumines the man and his art. Highest recommendation.

This book reads like an essential afterword to the great video series. The chapters on mythologies of love, and of war and peace are especially effective. Campbell's teaching is direct, and honed to a useful, beautiful glow. He's a courageous thinker, able to order considerable insights with impeccable ease. Leaves us the richer. He's hailed for the scope of his vision, yet it's the inevitable intimacy of Campbell's teaching genius that makes his books so effective. Read this book and find a realm vaster and more intimate than one that brung ya! --that's effective spiritual reading, the fruit of clearly intense scholarship, and Campbell makes it immediate and consoling. Delivers what it promises. It's difficult to be disappointed by stuff this fine.

A towering book of scholarship from the mind of a Japanese Zen master with an almost mystical mastery of English prose. One neednt be a student of Buddhism or particularly interested in the history of Zen and its historical impact to benefit mightily from this book. It's beautiful literature. The passages (in two generous chapters) on Zen and Swordsmanship boast standing with the best in English literature. Suzuki's perspective is broad and inclusive, if entirely his own, and includes the historic relationship of Zen to nature, art, haiku, and more narrowly to the Japanese Tea Ceremony. He remains more bountiful writer than succint personal teacher. It's a great book that can be read again and again. Suzuki's plane is infinite depth and light; he takes us in, for the book of a lifetime. Unconditional recommendation that amounts to urging you.

Reviewer Hadrian12's spotlight review says perfectly everything to say about this film. Thanks for that.I can think of no more compelling 20th c. musician. Everything about Reaching for the Note is about the living lamp that is Bernstein's work, about the music he became; always breathing life, whatever his job. The film spends generous time with West Side Story, with a remarkable stretch of essential comments by Sondheim, Carol Lawrence, &Arthur; Larents interspersing a cache of unbelievable rehearsal and performance footage. It's a master class in filmmaking, and we believe again how great a work West Side Story is. His symphonies, greater than the world knows, confirm the film's heart. In generous performance passages of the Kaddish Sym., the voice overs are subdued, as if in the live presence of the music. The film never wavers in its tenderness toward Bernstein, and the Idea he embodied.Best thing about this American Masters series perfect jewel, is hearing Bernstein's occasional remarks - to hear his voice again!. About his own intensity, he says "What I enjoy, I want to share." Enjoy this film treat! It proves the inerrant spirituality of Art, and shows the door to mediocre moments.

This collection contains Roethke's "Words for the Wind", one of the great c20 collections by any poet. Everything Roethke touched came instantly to life. He's ignored for his classicism, so was Ravel. No matter. When it comes time to decide what a poem is, they'll turn to Roethke.

This final installment of the mysteries of Brother Cadfael finds Ellis Peters in outstanding form- what prose this Englishwoman conjures! Of all the Cadfael mysteries, this is one of the finest! The writing is typically adroit - wise, full and redeeming, and the passages found toward the last third of the book, describing the interior heart of Brother Cadfael towards Olivier, his 'unknown' son, are as beautifully trenchant as anything one will find in popular prose writing. In this series of books, the mysteries themselves are always well-placed and fascinating, authentic and without tricks, but again, it is the superlative writing of Ellis Peters, the warmth of the language and the architecture of its comeliness, that captivates; indeed, she has permanently raised the genre of mystery novel to a new plateau of genuine literary interest. P.D. James, eat your heart out! All 20 Cadfael mysteries highly recommended - an addiction to treasure!

This is surely one of the warmest, most intelligent, most readable works of scholarship ever composed! The not inconsequential history of the Cistercian Order, the men and women that have peopled it like robins arriving and defining their eternal Spring, and at the same time, the sacred history of one man's soul are all found here in a text beautifully composed with order, entrancing prose, and the humility of true faith. This is my favorite Merton book, I think because it is so full of his new love! Written in 1949, &quot;The Waters of Siloe&quot; is rivaled only by &quot;The Sign of Jonas&quot; for its beauty and depth of meaning. Layers of beauty and solitude pervade every page, taking the reader into Merton's own heart, really, into the deep still water of his life as a priest and Trappist monk. Merton's astounding facility as a writer is always subordinate to the searching of his own heart, so that even while he writes like a prophet, he plays at no pretense of knowledge or superior understanding, keeping his formidable gifts focused on the object of his love and study, his Christ and the monastic vocation. Such a delicate balance only shows forth his literary genius all the more, yet leaves such a sweetness in the heart that one wants to give up all literature for the love of God, whatever one's natural inclincations, whatever one's tradition. Merton's is a rare and matchless talent, the gift of true understanding, really, and never used more wisely or more warmly than in &quot;The Waters of Siloe&quot;. If you are a seeker who desires to know what it is to enter upon the path, to suffer and be glad, read this book. There isn't another like it.

Cavil about historical accuracy, over-the-top bodice-infatuated costuming, this that and a thousand other things - this is just flat out one helluva movie! Without question the most visually ecstatic film since Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring.. Curse of the Golden Flower is more intoxicating than the empress' hourly medicine! What an actor Li Gong is, and gorgeous to look at. Yun Fat Chow is the first eminence of the whole piece, as he is in virtually every film he makes. I submit that in the end it isnt the camera's magnificence that triumphs, but a story of human destiny told with blood-burning intimacy. Far from being a "martial arts" film as it's often said, Curse of the Golden Flower flies from the curse of formula, bemoaning it in almost every scene, with exceeding interior beauty. It's a spiritual film perhaps BECAUSE of its operatic heart, who knows? The scenes are bewitching, riveting; the force of the actors' embodiments lifts the piece to wild heights, which is to say, toward the actual. From beginning to end, Li Gong carries the complete story in her face. Every minor part - the court doctor, his daughter - is spun with consummate finesse. Another treasure is this film's uncommonly beautiful score, subtly integrated as another and equal dimension of character. One of the finest movie scores in years. It's just one helluva movie! If we want 'historical' China and look for it everywhere, entertainment will rarely hand us the pivotal tool to crack the nut. But to congregate the shamelessly intense ethos of China, the koan, if you will, of China, and hand it jewel-like to us, is indeed what film can do, what it can be. In forms visible and invisible, Curse of the Golden Flower dreams and matches, near perfectly, far as I can tell, the spiritual truth of human experience. Watch it and live!

Glenn Gould has become a cottage industry, I guess. What does it matter, when films this fine come along. Bruno Monsaigneon strikes gold with a fresh look at a music giant. All Monsaigneon's films are gems. (his film of Menuhin's return to Russia - the patience and vision sticks with me. It should be made available again.) Monsaigneon arranges his films like subtle puzzles, like paintings. Hereafter is exquisite in that way. Most of the footage used is new to me, and that's saying something since video Gouldiana is abundant, most of it repetitive in varying degrees. Hereafter's colors and sounds are modern and true, even kindly, in their way, as Gould was in his. Monsaigneon divulges a keen cinematic palette so authoritatively it seems nonchalant. Rather much like Gould's playing. His honest affection for Gould is evident. It is, moreover, adoration of Gould's art that sings and makes this film what it is. Gould's playing throughout is stupendous, baronial, overwhelming. I've never seen footage like it! A few high wires, and always that truth-telling sound that was Gould's alone, that wins souls. Absolute recommendation to both acolyte and novice. Thanks Monsaigneon for your painstaking work. And for always looking after Glenn Gould. This piece is a winner - don't hesitate.

A fittingly sumptuous, all-encompassing look at Montserrat Caballe - her life and career, and especially her family. The archival footage of early Caballe performances is riveting, to be sure, and a thankfully sure intelligence in editing informs throughout. The tributes and comments of other artists reveal the awe and affection for Caballe held by her peers. Many affecting moments are spent with her family - brother Carlos, whose managerial genius assured her golden career, husband Bernabe erupting in song at Caballe's birthday party, & her son and daughter reveal their mother and themselves, with insight. Caballe's temperament shines, a complete musicianship utterly rare in a singer, and will and serenity to settle the question of the source of her magical musical gifts, and the success made of them. The enigma of her collaboration with F Mercury is spotlighted, bursts of laughter with her brother, her love of the Liceu Theatre - all contribute to a compelling journey with this artist. Caballe's sensitive and compassionate remarks about Maria Callas are beautiful, and vital to the film. They reflect the passion of Montserrat Caballe: the great love she holds for her family, and for art. Docu-bios abound, this one's something special. An exceptional film at a good price.

So many people have spoken so well here of the experience of this book, I'm barely chagrined to have nothing new but honest praise for it. I've lived with, and tried to live, this book for years. Its pages are the clearest light, &amp; the cleanest water. It remains unspoiled, evergreen, &amp; always ready to hand you everything whole each time you encounter it. I remember Shunyru Suzuki in SF, even before Tassajara, years before I knew anything at all! I'm embarassed by the few buddhists writing reviews of 'heresy, heresy'... roshi is laughing at their passionate defence, even admiring it! Better, he'd say, simply look and see. That way you know that heresy never shines a light, then your attention can bear fruit. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind may be the single most inevitable spiritual document of the last century. Its pages become lighter and more clean to the bone with each passing day. Read this book and find the REAL way to end war. Find out the REAL peace. It brings you right up to yourself. Once read, everything changes. It's like getting REAL eyes. Recommended with real heart!

Moffo was a fine singer but perhaps not a great one, and in most of the repertory on this disc it unfortunately becomes a critical distinction. Lakme's Bell Song is so pale and lacking in fire it feels almost doused. You cant help but hear Sutherland's defining version from beginning to end, ruining whatever Moffo may have to offer us, which apparently isnt much. Micaela's aria fares better. Other reviews here already speak knowledgably of a number of definite vocal deficiencies in this program, her debut recital disc (1960). The best thing about Moffo's singing is a wide open sound of tremendous ease and technical mastery, at least in the lyric repertory. Hers is an instrument of special cool colors that ravish but rarely electrify (her Traviata is an exception to that), suggesting care is critical in choosing successful roles. Not surprisingly, her later recording of Rachmaninov's ubiquitous 'Vocalise' is one of the finest ever recorded, supple and pure and free, and I think her Violetta ranks among the top five recorded versions - beside Caballe, Sutherland and Cotrubas, surely. I've always thought Moffo a somewhat neglected artist, and that's probably true, but this disc doesnt do much to invigorate new admirers. Tullio Serafin conducts a sumptuous sounding Rome Opera Orchestra with characteristic elan, what an opera man he was! On the whole, this recording probably deserves four stars, but the Bell Song that closes the program is a REALLY dismal experience.

A visually hypnotic film around a contagiously simple tale. The Wise One's temple hut on the lake - more or less the physical heart of the film's story - is treated like heaven's courtyard, with stupefying cinematography to linger in your mind long after. The alluring mystery of land and water, gorgeously invoked, enshrines with perfect balance a brutally real story of redemption and acceptance. Through each season's segment, director Kim Ki-Duk frees a vital flow that deeply mirrors the Buddhist essence. Best, it's a spiritual film that miraculously escapes becoming a moral fable. The conscious absence of sentimentality leaves truth alive and real, and points silently to cinema's inherent art to reveal the Buddhist aesthetic. It's a beautiful movie, well worth the time and money. Not Buddhist? you'll love it anyway because truth is fecund, but for Buddhists the film offers unique lessons without distraction, and that's refreshing. The winter scenes of ice and snow (including a waterfall frozen in full plunge!) are among the most pungent, and beautiful, and contain as well key elements of the story itself. My favorite scene is the penitent carving overnight the Heart Sutra characters on the deck floor; Buddhists call the Prajnaparamita Sutra the holy mother that feeds the practitioner with wisdom - clearly the source of Director Kim Ki-Duk's rich vision. I'm grateful a friend turned me to this movie. Urgently recommended.

I've watched these Lord Harewood interviews of Callas many times, each time startled by some point, some gesture I'd missed before. Callas is a vessel of fire when she speaks about Art, incendiary and completely vital. One quickly starts to feel keenly the modesty she possessed, owning her workman's ethic for the noble component it is. By that alone, every viewing of the Conversations is an invigorating experience. Harewood's interested courtliness, washed innocent by instinctive intelligence and by a real love for opera, is an important element. His steadiness throughout proves Maria's clear trust in him. Callas' depth of understanding of her art manifests over and again. In extras, her 60's French TV interview with Bernard Gavoty turns almost whimsical with the enthusiasm of them both. Maria's gifted intelligence entices as her youthful Hepburnesque face enchants, in almost daring television lights. Her command of French clicks in impeccably, and matches her English manner of speaking with a measured, forthright cadence, but with a wry coquettishness that would disarm Hannibal. And a shamelessly intense young Callas sings 'Mio babbino caro' with a freedom and elan to make you stand up and cheer. This is a documentary adventure with serious underpinnings, and as significant a witness to the inherent truth of Art as we're ever likely to find. Pure satisfaction to the max.

This is a really fine series. I've watched it four or five times, and each time an interesting hidden nugget or two pops up. Jackson dominates the film like a titan. Her prowess is undeniable and unforgettable. She gets the importance of Elizabeth's fierce intellect, and it makes every moment spent with her transparent, heightened by using Elizabeth's own words and expression. I can't think of another portrayal of Elizabeth that comes close. The film conveys mediaeval court coarseness with confidence and beauty, and it pulses with Jackson's genius beginning to end. In the presence of her Elizabeth, you're pulled way beyond acting; a coruscating diversion, and one here recommended. Each episode's script surpasses the perfect one previous, one of the film's best features. Perennial BBC production values are front and center, and the cast is crackling. Robert Hardy takes an oddly unsettling turn as Dudley, but truth is, Glenda Jackson ignites and nothing else matters. It's a tour de force full of rewards. You'll find nothing else even registering in the region. Handsome kudos to BBC and the English theatre tradition, still unsurpassed. Check it out.

This is daring, high-wire exploratory literature of the most beguiling kind. Much more than a reach into the mystery-laden world of one aspect of gay culture, though it is that as well, this is a book about desire, about the fantastical meanings within music, about enslavement and redemption. I read the book in one sitting. It's a devastating piece of prose writing, it gleams and pulls you awake with pins! It is a riveting exposition of the extravagance of sexuality, of sexual desire as metaphor for psychological neglect, an enticing and bewitching brew of fantasy and sorrow. Koestenbaum is in sublime command of his thought, the language is both startling and voluptuous, operatic, really. In Chapter 4, entitled &quot;The Callas Cult&quot;, he begins one paragraph &quot;Worshipping Callas, am I behaving like a vulture?&quot; After thoroughly examining the widespread, unreasoned obsession with Maria Callas, he concludes &quot;But it's impossible to circumscribe love. As a commentator, one can only operate like a skylight at a premiere, advertising a location.&quot; The mastery of prose throughout is never anything short of brilliant, and is often ecstatic, so that the book's 'colors' dip inevitably toward the mystical, the ineffable. I think it is a complete triumph, a masterfully accomplished piece of unforgettable literature. Highest recommendation.

There are a handful of artists for whom a rating of 5 stars seems woefully inadequate, and a little absurd! Legendary soprano Montserrat Caballe is one such artist. This is a splendid collection of her art, the kind of musical experience that can change your life. Nearly everyone remarks on Caballe's breathtaking pianissimos, and they are certainly noteworthy given the number of bellowers passing for opera singers, but too few remark upon the nature of her musicality, her inborn understanding of the musical line, in a word, her phrasing. Caballe's musicality is the defining element of her ravishing genius, and the natural musical intelligence driving, sustaining, and making all things whole is stupendous not simply for the perfection of its parts, but is remarkable above all because it is always so wisely employed, with a subtlety and restraint that is at times almost unbearable in its beauty. Critics have been known to refer to her self-indulgence in handling a musical phrase, suggesting that to indulge this kind of matchless musical intelligence could manifest as a fault. To paraphrase the well known advertising hook - Silly Critics, tricks are for kids! And Mme. Caballe is no kid, but a supreme artist. If one could illustrate faultless artistry, the first name rising to mind is Montserrat Caballe. There are only a few- Richter, Menuhin, certainly not Callas, whose discipline, extravagant though it was, could never quite compensate for an insufficiency of native gifts. This CD, like a number of Caballe's other efforts, simply poses the question again: when once one has tasted the divine, what use has one for the earthbound? Get this recording and leave earth's chains behind!

This fifth volume of Merton's Journals hits a home run, an analogy Thomas Merton would probably relish. I've read volumes 1 through 5, and here Merton hits his stride. The diarist in Merton contributes nearly everything within his vast sight and makes it important and touching. The lengthier review on this page covers the base ground admirably. One of the really interesting aspects of these journals is the inadvertently given bibliography of Merton's own reading material, everything from Elias Canetti to Barth to D. T. Suzuki! These volumes give us a whole and uncompromising look at Merton's innermost sensibilities, apparent in his formal oeuvre, but turned over and examined like a winter leaf in these journals. I think the various editors of these volumes, a different editor for each, deserve high praise for the consistency of tone in their editing, one volume to the next; a job done wisely and well. It is as well a tribute to the consistency of Merton's path over the years. He was a true monk, an authentic thinker in the best tradition, and a heck of a writer. When Thomas Merton writes, he never loses that clear-sky-with-stars timbre of voice, spending his real humility like gold, and awakening all the sleeping people. The more I read these journals the more I miss him. Noble and unforgettable.

Joni Mitchell's work is a stream of loving art, art that actually loves. 'Night Ride Home' is an imcomparable CD, easily on a par with 'Dog Eat Dog', 'Turbulent Indigo', and 'Blue'. Mitchell's musicianship is like a night watchman, faithful and rare and so adeptly attuned. Everything she touches, when she really touches it, becomes the gold of our lifetimes. On this disc all the tracks are little wonders; title track, 'Come In From the Cold', 'Passion Play', and 'Only Joy In Town' are as fine as anything Mitchell's written. Her musical art is so subtle, it gets overlooked, but so what! Musicians know who and what she is, and what is genius. That's too hearty a word for her layers of gifts, too rough a praise, but you get the picture... I was listening to the string ideas in the back of 'Two Grey Rooms' driving down the hill tonight-- what an almost Bert Kaempfert feel. I thought who IS this woman, really? and how is it that her art is so fulsome, and plain wonderful? Check out this CD and get some light for the night.

These somewhat older recordings of three of Bach's greatest cantatas deliver superb music making! Cantata 147 features memorably articulate, vibrant and focused singing by a young Joan Sutherland; the performance of the famous chorale, though taken perhaps a tad slow, richly serves the incumbent spirituality of Bach's music. Better the understatement found here than the racing tempi that ruin at least four other major versions I have. Gardner's tempi are acceptable, but the playing is not as focused as it is under these conductors. The orchestras here are pliant and attentive, partnering splendid singing with a devoted sense of intimacy. Altmeyer, Baker & Ameling are especially fine soloists in the other two cantatas. I've heard many performances of Bach's cantatas and consider these among the very best recorded versions. With so many recordings of the cantatas available, one would think there should be many musically fine editions from which to choose and be content, but memorable performances are rare enough indeed. Music making of this kind quashes an already notoriously thin controversy with respect to period instruments and style. This is music verily from the inside out, nothing less. It's a delight to experience from beginning to end. A separate chorale version of 'Jesu, meine Freude' (with slightly altered melodic cadence) is an unexpected additional treat. Don't hesitate, for Bach's sake!

The heart of this collection of Spanish Renaissance canciones is the enduring musical presence of Montserrat Caballe, whose vivifying art spans the second half of the twentieth century like a colossus. I can think of few artists who better exemplify the humility required to consistently reveal art as an essential component of human progress. Caballe, among them all, is the complete humanist, the complete artist. Who can afford not to be grateful for these things?She sings accompanied only by the intriguing vihuela de mano, masterfully played by Manuel Cubedo. Fittingly used for these musical gems of renaissance Spain, this stringed instrument possesses a complex intonation conformed to the human voice. The CD notes hold another gem - an essay (printed in three languages) by Cesar Rodriguez Campos, called "The Enraptured Spirit: Song and Vihuela de mano in the 16th Century", an informative addition to a compelling disc. The Spanish text of each song is also provided.Caballe's genial musical majesty pervades every track. Those elements of her art that inform and transcend the operatic canon, are present here, refined to mystical simplicity and pleasure: the artist in her native tongue, lissome ornamentation, serious preparation and scholarship. What emerges is a portrait of the artist as carriage of the spiritual. So, this is a transforming recording. You can say this is Montserrat after opera. I think the arc of her art extends even to these delicacies. Only one whose gifts replenished the operatic art's true conformation, as being one that must rest upon the human voice alone as on an unchangable foundation, could create a recording as revealing as this one. Recommended.

Probably not, but this is a surprisingly shallow psychobiography of a remarkable musician of enormous attractiveness; Glenn Gould was so gifted one might call him laden, and indeed Ostwald genuinely recognises this extraordinary condition, only to question the idea of such a thing, let alone its value, for the length of the book. Well, it was simply a fact, and for all Gould's self-oppression, it's clear that he lived his extraordinary life as he wished, on his own terms, without regret; and considering the gifts of art left to the world by this magisterial musician, one cannot but admire the whole man, eccentricities and all! In any case, Ostwald was never Gould's shrink, at least not in a professional sense, and who knows, perhaps the author is a better musician than writer. As to Glenn Gould and how much of him is conjured in these pages, there is a great deal more to be said about Gould, but you'll not find much in this book. The writing style is inapt, a reminiscence of sorts but with no warmth, certainly none to match the indelible warmth of its subject; Glenn Gould's artistic legacy remains not only intact, but warm and alive. Though I have read most of Gould's own writings (a worthwhile endeavor, by the way), and a number of compilations including various appreciations of the man, this was the first full-scale biography for me; surely there are others more appropriately seasoned with right perspective. Ostwald doesn't go very deep; one suspects he probed as deep as he was capable, but in the end one is left concerned that not much but the surface was peeled away. Disappointing for us Gould-aholics, but not a complete waste of time.

I wish this were a different recording than it is. Neither Bell nor Salonen can be faulted for lacking artistic, and even musical, intelligence, and together they foster some interesting ideas in the Sibelius, but still seem to miss the piece. Bell's individualist streak --genius, really-- is a strong component in all his recordings, &amp; he appears here in an almost cinematic mood. Is this Sibelius as movie music? I wonder what Sibelius would say.. I generally like Bell's take on the major repertory, and even his ideas ABOUT music and repertory. He's an exciting player for sure, &amp; has an authentic musical voice, lacking little in his apparently on-going fleshing out of the whole youthful prodigy thing. And yet, though the Sibelius is beautifully prepared, manicured, even, it's NOT fired up. Not much believed in maybe, from what I hear on this disc. Oistrakh and Ormandy were fired up. Cho Liang-Lin's version fires up everything it touches! It's curious how debonair a Sibelius concerto we're given here. Salonen and the L.A. Phil are vibrant partners, as always. The Goldmark's an interesting piece, but it tends to bring out the southern california sheen that plagues this orch. on occasion. That's not a crime, but you need to pick and choose your moments. Salonen is gifted and wise, &amp; mostly ends up on the right side of things. The direction these musicians want to take the Sibelius comes clear early on, and they sustain the arc of their ideas well; it may be more Bell than Sibelius, but Salonen surpasses in any case; besides, people said the same about Gould's Bach, and it's still revealing itself today. Sonics are nothing special here &amp; this isnt a GREAT recording, but it's interestingly argued.

It would seem difficult to commend sufficiently the merit of this book. Despite lackluster writing by journalist Vicki MacKenzie (whose fascinating book on lama Osel, the surprising tulku recently discovered in Spain, seemed affected arbitrarily by the same lack of dynamism in the writing) the story of Tenzin Palmo shines through, and witnesses to a kind of freedom that is the stuff of legend, and a harbinger of peace. Her presence is clear on every page, distinct and standing and shining on its own power, and perhaps in that way MacKenzie's notably waveless style serves the book well. The book is assembled beautifully, MacKenzie takes her time in just the right places; the final few chapters take up a kind of ecstatic explosion of joy, rumbling to a final free-flying celebration of a remarkable woman's life and freedom. I enjoyed it immensely; and what really calls, and remains a part of us is the woman, this rather great personage of achievement, the lama of freedom- Tenzin Palmo! Her teaching is without any superfluous edges, one finds on nearly every page of this book an immensely grateful and happily intelligent woman, one worth considering for the quality of her genuine spiritual impact. One of the more satisfying books I've read this year, its minimalist decor notwithstanding; not that the writing is so impoverished, but a little bloodless, as I say. But take heart, Tendzin Palmo is a bountiful journey! 4 glad stars!

This is a fine book on many levels. Subjects are parsed in sections - Personages, Palaces, Possessions, Pageantry, Pleasures - and the narrative is fluid and distinct. Chapters on the extensive Romanov family are fashioned with critically vivid directness, and the author comes into his own discussing the Romanov palaces. King needn't take a back seat to anyone with respect to understanding architecture and its many-layered meanings. Detailed descriptions of the various Romanov houses gives this book great value both historical and artistic, with a completeness missing in other literature on the subject. Along the way there are some real tidbits - about the emperor's library at the Winter Palace, he reveals that the Imperial Bindery provided the collection of rare volumes with new leather bindings: brown for works in Russian, blue for French, red for those in English, green for German. King reveals that the Chesme room at Peterhof took its name from twelve large canvases by Jacob Philippe Hackaert, depicting the Russian naval victory over Turkey in the Mediterranean in the early 1770s. When Hackaert worked on his commission, the Russian navy actually had a sixty-gun frigate blown up as it lay at anchor, so that the painter might accurately reflect the horrors of battle! The book contains three large sections of beautiful color photos. Unfortunately, a number of interesting photos are in black and white; one especially, the homely Lower Palace at Alexandria, Peterhof, I wish was color, but the photos are pungent and important, with the large color shots reproduced again in b/w miniature on those pages of text germane to them. Especially valuable is a rare photo of mediaeval-inspired Feodorovsky Sobor in the Alexander Park at Tsarkoye Selo, its hipped roofs and vaulted arcades topped with a single onion dome above its chapel. It's a magnificent edifice! Nicholas II, who nursed a love of mediaeval architecture, loved this anachronistic fantasy and commissioned additional buildings in the same style. The book dazzles with details, architectural and otherwise, each chosen with purpose. That purpose, it turns out, is the revealing of Nicholas and Alexandra. Strange as it seems, this book about the material, as it were, of the court of Nicholas II, ends by revealing profoundly the fated couple. Perhaps no other book has opened more deeply the mystery of Nicholas and his Empress. THIS is the real treasure of 'Court of the Last Tsar'. It's not surprising King's reputation for essential scholarship noticably rises. If you've an interest in, or better, a love for Romanov history, this is the book to read. By shaping the discussion around palaces and ceremonies and privileges, the intense mystical humanity of Nicholas and Alexandra comes screaming through - vibrant with tenderness and grief, misunderstood, sacrificial. I'm tremendously moved by this book and you will be too. One of the great mysteries of human history nobly emerges almost, it would seem, by accident. It's transfixing from beginning to end. Greatly, generously, unreservedly recommended reading.

Somebody should make an opera of this book! I've loved this book since high school, perhaps more than all the others! Genet as always is like a dark narcotic; impossible to shake, and constantly ecstatic. His genius is like a kind of suffocating honey on the page, it pulls your heart out. This edition has a substantive Introduction by Sartre, whose &quot;Saint Genet&quot; is one of the seminal books of the late twentieth century. If you've never read Genet, you've got something coming! What is there to say about literature of this standing? Read it and be ennobled.

Gifted director/designer Julie Taymor apparently secures one amazing success after another, and this arresting production is surely one of her supreme creations! Adapting the conventions of the seventeenth-century opera-oratorio, Stravinsky's 1927 score marks the beginning of his neoclassical period, with absolute command of both orchestral writing and dramatic intensity. It's interesting that Stravinsky's stated reason for choosing Latin for the score's libretto - '(it) had the great advantage of giving me a medium not dead but turned to stone, and so monumentalised as to have become immune from any risk of vulgarisation' - is precisely that offered by the Roman Church as the reason for her codification of Latin as its liturgical language (before the desacralisation of the Roman liturgy by neo-modernist barbarians). In fact, Cocteau's libretto was translated from French to Latin by the Jesuit (later Cardinal) Jean Danielou. The impersonality of the text/poem itself has the adroit effect of freezing dramatic consequence to the point of white heat, intuitively heightening the entire drama, something Stravinsky no doubt foresaw and is, interestingly, the key facet out of which Taymor vividly draws unerring pathos. The design of this production is like nothing else! That being said, the singing is magnificent - Jessye Norman, Philip Landridge and Bryn Terfel all in rare and perfect form, Norman especially, with her leonine face and voice delivers a riveting Jocasta in the performance of a career, something all the more shocking given the princely Impersonal so deliberately embedded by Stravinsky in the score itself. Norman and Ozawa have often worked together to wonderful effect (their recording of Carmen comes to mind), and the elucidation of detail he draws from the Saito Kinen Orchestra is astonishing at every turn. This is a piece impossible to completely absorb in one read through, but repeated viewings easily yield its greatness, and the DVD bonus extras are a vital part of reaping every ounce of the greatness of this superb production. Highest recommendation.

This set of five CDs fills a long standing need for a modern version of Milhaud's symphonies. It is easy to think of Darius Milhaud as primarily a miniaturist, and it is true that he resisted the symphonic form for a good part of his vast and surpassingly fecund compositional life (the first Symphony is marked Opus 210!), but this fine series of recordings gives that notion the boot. Meticulously prepared and recorded -the sound is superb!- the Basel Radio Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Alun Francis does Milhaud homage, and gives us a convincing look at these neglected works. The first four symphonies seem the weakest of the lot, a bit overly martial, and the horns have plenty to do, sometimes seeming much ado about nothing. As Milhaud assimilates the symphonic form, however, he naturally conquers it, producing, frankly, some of the most beautiful music around. Nos. 7, 11, &amp; 12 are especially fine. You'll find no Germanic grappling in these works, indeed the smile of Provence is all over them. Milhaud's grasp of the symphonic form is mature and all-encompassing, yet employing such uncanny orchestration that one never loses the sense of hearing fine chamber music. Absolutely delightful. I'd not heard this orchestra before, and they're an impressive lot. If you don't know Darius Milhaud's music, perhaps some of his smaller pieces (even the marvelous songs!) are a better starting point, but these recordings won't disappoint even the unacquainted. If you already know and appreciate Milhaud's cast of mind, what are you waiting for!

This remastered collection of Maria Callas' art has converted me. I've been hard on the Callas legend for most of my listening life, and hard on her singing, and not only in these pages. I always wanted more from the VOICE, feeling that its limitations created decline in other aspects of her art. Even ceding her genius, always there remained an uncomfortable appreciation; the voice itself was in the way. Listening to this superlative disc simply opened my eyes and ears! After 40 years of listening to this stuff and experiencing so many singers again and again, with this recording Callas is suddenly a revelation for me. This is singing imbued with an amazing integrity. I'm astounded. Ebben? ne andr&ograve; lontana (La Wally) offers an unheard of Callas, channeling her dramatic understanding INTO the music, instead of alongside it. I always felt Callas a fearful singer, when it came right down to it. How wrong could I have been! One track after another, this collection presents a fearless art in full bloom, a singer capable of a pathos that not only grabs you, but blesses. Her J'ai perdu mon Eurydice (Orph&eacute;e et Eurydice) is mesmerizing, completely free and true. The Puccini is almost classical in its restraint, and is a wonderful experience because of it. Her singing of the arias from Gioconda and Louise is incandescent. I dont know what brought me to the light, but I recommend you listen to THIS recording of Maria Callas. The sequence of arias presented is especially fine, and Serafin, Pretres, and Karajan contribute notably - and Maria Callas is a complete revelation in every way, a supreme musician in command of a high art. Check it for yourself.

One of Horowitz's most rewarding discs. I don't like the remastering work here much either, but it's still a first-rate recording. The first issue had a more authentic sound. Audiophile concerns, however, are the least important aspect attending a recording like this. The playing is stupendous in every way - magisterial and lighthearted at once! For all his natural Russian bluff (something essential to his art, and hardly a disparaged excess), Horowitz is ultimately a color man, and a singer when he plays; his Scarlatti in fact owes everything to the opera, so layered with detail, and delight of the 'first' voices. When I hear Horowitz's Chopin, I often think of Guiomar Novaes- not the same movement of sound, but the same ideal of singing in the playing. The 'L'Adieu' is perfect art here, the kind Horowitz never failed to honor with his Chopin. A good deal of what we truly love about Horowitz's playing is of course the pianos he uses, why not say it?! HE would! This recording at the Met illustrates that principle in beautiful proportions; the sound of the instrument (I suspect it's the one from his home?) is a constant joy throughout the recording, especially on the first issue CD. The second half of the program here is both ambitious and safe (I think the programming finer on the Moscow concert), but it's the Scarlatti that means the most; those sonatas like a row of little jewelled houses living under the sun are each a testament to the greatness of this man's pianistic art. Not only that, Horowitz was an enormously cultured man of constant individuality; the elegance of a legacy comprised of uncompromising musical taste and consummate daring speaks louder than the shadow of an almost savant facility. I think he was one of music's rare beings - this recording so testifies. Don't wait.

This music by Henze!! An exquisitely realised score in every way, music maker composer/conductor Oliver Knussen sees and understands Everything in this extraordinary score, with fetching results guaranteed to please! Perfect music making by the London Sinfonietta, and again, an extraordinary over-arching design of the piece by Knussen, Master of the orchestra and the revelation of her secrets. Henze's marvelous patina of intelligence is poured over every square inch of music here, and there is such naturalness in the way the score unfolds. By Knussen's obsessive attention to the detail of both musical and theatrical palettes, he forges in this recording an integral understanding of a modern masterpiece. The score is like a veiled prize that these musicians audaciously and seductively unsheathe moment by moment; it's a shattering work, with shining DG sonics--- the vibrancy and transparency of the strings in the boat music in Act 2 alone is worth the price of this set. Harrowing and brilliant-- you'd have to be a mummy not to feel the thrill of this superb score and its expert craftsmen and women! Highest recommendation -- GET IT!

'Grandly conceived and executed' .... 'Magnificent'.... 'Nothing less than masterly' ... critical tributes offered Sartre's Saint Genet that end as mere words. Saint Genet is an unearthly book wrought with the passion of a gospel narrative, explicit and wrenching. It is, finally, an entire act of redemption. The language is apocryphal and never operatic, epic in delivery, even greater than it seems; page upon page of an exceeding pure, and never vulgarly rich, damask brocade! I'll not critique Sartre's thought --it's privilege enough to be presented it!-- but this seminal work is a miraculous construct of human will and unbearable genius that will live forever, a complex and magisterial book ranking among the great achievments of modern literature because of its erudition, humanity, and fierce literary reach. There is not a page that doesn't honor wisdom, nor is there a single idle component. It is indisputably Sartre's crowning achievment as a genius, and as a man. The evocative humanity of two literary giants of the 20th century plays like a dance, the captured aesthetic of which Sartre reveals; everything is taken to the temple of Genet, everything explained, everything mortified, slain and remade. Reading this book is a revealing experience; be willing to be stolen. Theft happens in broad daylight, perpetrators already known.. My favorite chapter is 'Cain,' in which Sartre makes his most profound arguments about Genet as Other, Genet as the living inverse Liturgy, and presents a stupefying image of his subject: 'Everything is possessed, worked, occupied, from the sky to the subsoil...' Intimidating in its greatness.

This interesting version of Turandot is worthy on a number of accounts. To hear Montserrat Caballe step afield of her essentially lyric bel canto gifts to essay the role of Turandot is unusual in itself. That she would acquit herself with exquisite intelligence and characteristic lack of vocal pretense is almost a given, but the depth of her interpretation, if not surprising, is joyously rewarding. Her treatment of 'In questia reggia' will not please everyone, but several listenings begin to reveal a remarkably cohesive musical view which, while distinctly marked with Caballe's musical presence, unsheathes a multi-dimensional Turandot, something not afforded us by Marton, or certainly Nilsson, whose forays into these areas grew more frantic and embarassing the farther they drifted from Bayreuth. However, it is the magnificent singing of Leona Mitchell that makes this edition worth the price of admission. Such singing! It's clear that Ms. Mitchell, underappreciated in her own country, besides excelling in Puccini's operas generally (her Butterfly is a miracle!), is inspired to be singing Liu with one of the legendary interpreters of that role (Caballe). Her 'Signore ascolta' stands tall next to every other conceivable version, even Caballe's justifiably legendary interpretation. Pavarotti brings the sunshine with him, as usual. Chailly makes the most of the disappointingly modest artistic resources of the San Francisco Opera Orchestra, though the chorus sings splendidly. Live opera recordings are only rarely the best way to listen to an opera, for either veteran or neophyte, but this recording is an exception. And Leona Mitchell, whose exposition of the singing art reflects its sublime light even on the genius of her towering colleagues Caballe and Pavarotti, quickly becomes a thirst difficult to quench! Repeated listenings bring immense delight!

Pierre Boulez's formidable venture into Mahler's symphonies for Deutsche Grammophon hits a real high mark with this magnificent recording of the Fourth Symphony. The Cleveland Orchestra has long been one of America's finest playing ensembles, and its long association with Boulez has already produced grand results. That being said, clearly this offering is their finest collaboration to date! Cleveland Orchestra has a uniquely transparent sound with plenty of gravitas, all used to magnificent effect in the Mahler. The first movement is rightly brisk- on the edge of too quick, but, as is his custom, the musical intelligence of Boulez forges a kind of new identity for this well-known symphony at the outset. The second and third movements are beautifully conceived and played- sweet satisfaction with no sugar! The often devlish details are handled with typically cogent grace by Boulez, a master of the hidden art, and the wisdom of his reading is marked with no grandstanding, no romantic artifice. I prefer this recording to Bernstein's Fourth, though Bernstein's Mahler always has much to recommend it, for a number of reasons, principal among them being Bernstein's misguided choice of a boy soprano to sing the fourth movement. Novel, but the wrong kind of 'innocence', Lenny! Doesn't work! Here, Juliane Banse sings with a clean heart the remarkable 'song' of the last movement. One feels her singing arising, as it were, from out of Boulez's baton, so effortlessly matched are all the components of singer, orchestra, conductor, composer. An absolutely superb rendering of one of the twentieth century's masterpieces of art. If this isn't Mahler's idea of the Fourth, it ought to be!

There are three reasons this disc gets the high five rating: 'The Thrill is Gone', 'Try Matty's' and 'Why I Sing the Blues' ! I always felt this was an under-appreciated effort by Aretha. Aretha's piano work is forever as distinctive as is Ray Charles', and 'Try Matty's', besides being SUCH an Aretha song!, is transported by the glistening piano work she pulls off! This is one of the best of Ahmet Ertegun's almost mystical collaborations with this Genius! 'Why I Sing the Blues' with its compound rhythms and that un-bottled phrase &quot;Lookit! I brought this talent back - move over and give it some!&quot; is both a political anthem and one of the most sophisticated pieces of pop around. Aretha is a rare force of nature and this disc smokes like a hurricane! Get it!

My favorite piece in this book is 'Answers to a Questionnaire'-- vintage Sontag-- thinking, witnessing, and finally enlightening everything she must. Despite the self-loathing revealed by a number of American reviewers below who show themselves apparently ready to detest integrity itself, the naked truth comes clear and comes clear! Clear thinking may yet be the last frontier! A worthy argument for such is surely made in the pages of this book. It is even for those who are spiteful without cause to discover themselves lurking in the heart of this book, grevious as ignorance is, & wretched as spite becomes in the end. Listen-- vitriolic political sideswiping is as American as dumplings. Sontag, characteristically and sympathetically, not only notes its irrevelance, but conjures an antidote called moral patience, so no wonder all the shouts and curses against her! Making certain their own avenues of self-discovery venture nothing wiser than a hepped up, but sunless, hyper-nationalism wretchedly disguised as patriotism, it's unfortunately not surprising the chorus of disappoval this woman engenders. Thank goodness Sontag remains preoccupied with her Art!-- a living, teaching, redemptive art burnished, by now, to an holistic glow, as every page of this book bears witness. What in the world are you talking about??! -- SUSAN SONTAG IS AMERICAN TO THE CORE! I reckon that aspect of her identity contributes as much as any other of her native gifts to the beauty and usefulness of her art. Wake up, people!

This little 61 page book is comprised of a revision of five lectures given by Vaughan Williams at Cornell and Yale universities in 1954. The subjects covered are Why do we make music and What is music, How do we make music, What are the social foundations of music, The folk-song movement, and finally a deft little summary of sorts entitled Making your own music.Vaughan Williams reveals his deepest beliefs about music in these few pages, beliefs one finds richly abiding in his musical works. He is uncompromisingly English throughout - clear and spare and jubilant at the truth music affords - all done with subtlety, clarity and inventive thought. Mendelssohn used to say that the meaning of music was too precise for words, and perhaps this English composer has successfully defied that conclusion with these forthright essays.Citing Tovey that Bach never wrote for unaccompanied chorus (something that hadnt strictly speaking occured to me), Vaughan Williams quotes from 'St John's Passion' then chases Bach's true intentions over a page and a half finally concluding that perhaps what Bach really intended is actually realized in performances of his keyboard music played on a modern piano, not "the nasty jangling of the harpsichord to which he was condemned for filling in his continuo".Biting and bright, these essays reveal Vaughan Williams the composer as much as anything I can think of short of the music itself. A useful and invigorating few pages.

This is one of the supreme recordings in the history of the medium! Aretha in the absolute prime of her self-discovery on Atlantic, the hippest Muscle Shoals musicians around, musical arrangements that are unafraid of themselves, and a superior choice of material make this THE Aretha Franklin album, in my view! Every cut is a highlight- the natural, high-flying vocal improvisations of 'Ramblin' and 'Bring It On Home To Me', Aretha's astonishing interpretation of Billie Holiday's 'Crazy He Calls Me', the remaking of 'Gentle On My Mind' into something finally so distinctive- what can one say about an art this Right, this Complete? Just keep repeating the mantra...a RE tha .... a RE tha ... a RE tha......not much else to say. Thank god the Rev. C. L. had his baby girl in our lifetimes!

I love Mary living free in personal redemption she's struggled to achieve, and her music moves me in a way few singers do. I downloaded this CD from Itunes, havent read the liner notes,etc., so cant comment on the musicians/producers she works with here, but the writing, the musical arrangements and cohesion of the material, and unforgettable singing indicate that Blige is working at the top of her game. Breakthrough's the kind of deep soul effort I hoped Mary would do. 'Take Me As I Am', 'Be Without You', her collaboration with U2 on 'One', 'Father in You', and 'About You' that magically weaves musical goddess Nina Simone's take of 'Feelin Good' and f/Black Eyed Peas' Will.I.Am are real highlights of an CD that never lets up, breathing peace every step of the way. Blige's giant musicianship proves her as a vivid creative force &Breakthrough's a liberating joy from beginning to end.

Buble really doesnt launch any ships, and doesnt pretend around his art. What he really is - unmistakable, flawless, physical, and dead on with his singing - a remarkable talent showcased like a diamond in this PBS special. From the opening shots of the theatre interior, through a remarkable concert to the closing frame, nothing's amiss. The essence is all-powerful, and nothing extra is needed. Buble's apparently smart enough to know what matters, because everything about his show is given to serve a MUSICAL art, we're the luckiest for that! MUSICAL integrity makes the theatrical aspects of his stagecraft an accompaniment, and enticing. It's a refreshing feeling, for a change. From all the willing references in his style, he ends with a completely original product. His version of Try A Little Tenderness is alone worth the price of this dvd/concert audio pkg. He resurrects the narcotic tune Sway with abandon. His youth works for him, he's modern, and daring as hell. Buble's a singer (finally!) who trusts his voice through and through, and it lets a great simplicity sparkle. I'm an older chap and wouldnt expect to dig this guy's art this much, but I do, and you will too. It's an extraordinary concert from a glowing, knowing MUSICIAN. What more to ask?

Though a number of excellent translations of S. Teresa of Jesus and S. John of the Cross hold forth at present, none yet has rivaled the monumental work of translation and historical scholarship of the great English scholar Edgar Allison Peers (1891-1952), holder of the Gilmour Chair of Spanish at Liverpool University. His scholarship is permeated with an intense love of 16th century Spanish mysticism, and this slim volume is a masterclass not only in the theory and history of Spanish mysticism, but Peers leads us into the realms of love that characterize Christian mysticism in general. The fifteen studies that comprise this book include not only the better known of the Spanish mystics (Ramon Lull, Peter of Alcantara, Francisco de Osuna, as well as Teresa and John of the Cross), but Diego de Estella's Devout Meditations ("How love bears us to God..."), Alonzo de Orozco's "Last Degree of Contemplation", and Pedro Malon de Chaide's "One thing is needful". Vivid compressions drawn from Peers' vital masterpiece "Studies of the Spanish Mystics" (Sheldon Press London: 2volumes), this eye-opening little compendium is pure honey drawn by the master himself no less engaged, and indispensable in attaining to the heart of Spanish religious experience. Solid recommendation.

No more fitting trumpet could greet Benedict XVI's motu proprio 'Summorum Pontificum' liberating the ancient Roman liturgy than this Saint Austin Press publication of Dom Gueranger's monumental Liturgical Year. The majesty of the great Benedictine's masterwork, its breadth, indeed its holy breath, are the components of a miracle in religious literature. It occurs to me that even as Gueranger rescued the great Abbey of Solesmes from disappearance, and Roman chant from degredation, he gifts the Church yet more magnificently by this work. If you want to understand from the heart what has happened in the Church over the last forty years, you only need read The Liturgical Year. On the forward side, the riches of this masterpiece will prove true food for many people newly shaken by their first encounter with the ineffable Roman liturgy, now burgeoning everywhere around the world. To read Dom Gueranger is to see the future. I've loved this work for years, most especially those supreme Sequences of Adam of Saint-Victor. Gueranger's scholarship is pierced with pungent content and spoken with monastic length-of-days assurance. It's a joy to read for learning, and for devotion, and the traditional Missal is its well-considered companion. The Liturgical Year is a singular work of art, learning and spirituality. Viva Saint Austin Press! Viva Gueranger!

Eva Marton is in her prime in this open air Verona amphitheatre production of Tosca. Add the underrated tenor Giacomo Aragall and baritone Ingvar Wixell fleshing out a delicious Scarpia, and you've got a winner. I encountered this production in the 80s and watch it regularly. Marton was a great Tosca, able to act, with simmering musical intelligence and a huge voice that reveled in telling subtleties. Having just seen the recent Luc Bondy Tosca from the Met, with Karita Mattila singing, seeking solace I turned once again to this venerable version with relief. Say what you might about the transformations taking place in opera stagings around the world - Europe has become a nihilistic wasteland of avant garde deconstuction - the conscious parodies of self-loathing opera designers and directors who hate opera are no substitute for a realistic staging that reaches toward the mind and heart of the composer. I'm a musician with no malice toward progress, but I'm unwilling to beat the currently fashionable cadence declaring opera a museum art simply for upholding aesthetic standards that have grown organically from the art form itself. One of the best things about this Tosca remains the unbuttoned enthusiasm of the beautiful Italian audience, adorned with working class men and women who know and love Art when it flowers with the naturally abundant musical pride and joy that suffuses this first class production. Daniel Oren conducts with affection for all his singers. You can't go wrong!

The Valaam Institute choir in excellent form. The Tsarist National anthem performance is too refined. The arrangement unfortunately is spare rather than primal, the power of the basses not arriving until the end cadence, although effectively used there. The famous Valaam intonation on magnificent display from beginning to end. Both 'Oh, mighty Tsar!' and 'God, love the Tsar!' are captured with brimming musicianship and both are excellent anthems. The men sing the folk melodies with partiality, and it works beautifully. Great CD, but repeat I missed a bit of something in the singing of 'God, save the Tsar!' - it wants for more reverence, less civility.

This is a repellent, brutish book. I made myself read it to satisfy a dare I made myself, but also to find a cat's eye slant on Lynne Cheney, whose reputation as one of the more capable apparatchiks of New Town it seemed useful to pursue, even if providing but a moment's frivolity. What you meet with in the pages of this book is a large dose of political expediency, and a heap of quite sophisticated intellectual dishonesty. One certainly cannot admire the author, nothing prepares one for the intellectual posturing in this book, its content is consistently offensive; its doctrinaire boxing is merely annoying, but the doctrine itself is dangerous. Postmodernism will survive, and find new veins for strengthening itself for us all, despite this rampant little treatise. Like many conservatives, even thinking ones, Cheney easily (and always) paints herself into the proverbial corner by the broad strokes of her mean beliefs. These are a spider's thoughts, a spider's eyes looking at the world. 'Telling the Truth' doesn't tell the truth, and more, doesn't care. It's fascinating how many times in this book one hears how things must be tightened up, how more people must be made more accountable, how the tough must get tougher, it runs like a litany of the privileged. The privileged are always wanting to tighten things up. I expect this is one of the cleverer pieces that will be served up by the ruling class during the Bush years. Sure, for the obvious gifts of communication the author displays, it's an easy three stars; I simply can't credit a book that hasn't the self-respect to tell the truth.

Like a miner, Boulez finds the Inner symphony, the one hanging on inside lines, and leads Mahler to new light -and he lets the horns ride like sultans in the Andante! It's an amazing reading. Boulez' motive is so enlightened by care and love, his Mahler really comes like nothing else before it. I say no matter your experience with Mahler, listen to these recordings of the Symphonies by Boulez - even the CSO seems to extend itself. What a clement musician Boulez is! He sets those opening chords to splash and be plain until almost a kind of humming seems achieved, so indifferent is he to everything but the most transparent witnessing of the score. It's an extraordinary idea. This is musicianship to admire forever, courageous and operating in high country in these Mahler recordings. The last movement here is as harrowing as the first is emotional! And the DG sonics are part of the wonderful story! Get this recording! After the experience, you'll seek no other Mahler 9 for some long time.

Hindemith rules! This is the finest Hindemith recording I own. Released on the Delos label, &quot;The Four Temperaments&quot; is royally played, DePriest the fiery wizard, and resounding piano work by Carol Rosenberger. Balanchine chose this music years ago, but it has remained much more than a ballet. What a score! Another ballet score, &quot;Nobilissima visione&quot; is a resplendent work, an outgrowth of Hindemith's encounter with the frescos of Giotto. Again, Rosenberger's piano work is really fine, and the Royal Philharmonic is gritty and right-there-in-the-moment. I can't stress too much the first-rate work of the RPO, DePriest keeps them luminous. The stature of these works is treated so honorably by these folks that the listening never grows old. An exciting recording. Highest recommendation.

A beautiful hour-long video documentary of a 90 day retreat for Zen (Cham Sun) Buddhist nuns at 10th century Baek Hung Temple in South Korea. Throughout long meditation periods, the Zen master's discreet encouragements, manual labor, cooking, eating, and more long meditation periods, the camera NEVER intrudes, creating in the viewer a natural sense of being present at retreat. The silence of the film is positively life-giving. The pungent natural winter landscapes outside the monastery remind me of Korean film master Ki-Duk Kim's work. Heartily recommended for practictioners, and surely many people can reap rewards from an effort as honest as this. In Search of Self possesses a spiritual essence not to cajole or intervene, but to leave free and gratified anyone who seeks a film like this for sustenance.

I commend New Directions for issuing a facsimile reprint of the original of this valuable book. Who would not say that here is a publishing company of enduring and impeccable taste? I have a copy of the original cloth bound book- it is beautiful, and easily one of my top twenty favorite books. I believe this is the book that comes most surely from Merton the poet. His consideration of the Psalms is inspired; the language in this book is as severe and ecstatic as are the Psalms themselves, and his insight into their relevance is without peer. The brevity of Merton's exposition is part of its potency. Nothing is wasted. Like the Psalms themselves, the veins of this book run deep in kingly rivers, announcing the heart of God like a morning song. Merton's interior acquisition of that song is of epic intensity, yet simple as clean water. I believe &quot;Bread in the Wilderness&quot; surpasses even &quot;Seeds of Contemplation&quot; in directness, common heart, and indeed artistic beauty. It's an indescribably beautiful book that moves, aches and rocks, and leads one, ultimately, to the inmost core of revelation, which is, after all, believability. Merton's references to the Psalms can be traced like a monk's thread throughout all of his writing, from the earliest books up through the posthumously published Journals. This book gives us a clear understanding of how constantly faithful Thomas Merton remained not only to the brilliant song of the Psalms themselves, but to the music of his own exceeding heart. And the woodcut Christ on the cover is so unfailingly Cistercian! This is a book that will live forever.

This is a beautiful reading of Hindemith's 'Ludus tonalis.' Aldwell's approach is lyrical and meaningful, with figures of sprite and humor. The famous blues sequence at the conclusion of Fuga V is treated with perfect dryness by Aldwell, redeeming with such touches, as he does, a decidedly lyrical reading of a marvelous score. He's clearly a marvelous pianist, and an intelligent one. Hindemith's 'howling in the wilderness,' as his work and career during the period of serialist triumph has been called, is vindicated with performances of this quality attending his music. And that's surely a good thing! What people will intimate about the patina of learnedness that subsumes Hindemith's music is probably true, but there's much to admire in its emotional contact and content. Hindemith's heart beats --perhaps a fugal beat!-- but it's real, and informs his music with a particular caste, almost an ethos, of its own. Aldwell misses nothing of Hindemith's line of offense, but takes it to humanity, like a mediator priest, as a proposition for the good of all; it is easy to accept the proposal. This is a recording of tremendous integrity. Unfortunately, the sonic acoustic is somewhat dull. A dull acoustic could work well with this score if it were an enlightening sonic nonetheless --not the case here. This is alleviated considerably, however, by the superb sound of the Hamburg Steinway Aldwell plays-- magnificent timbre to the instrument, something used to the max by Aldwell, who, like a singer (exactly what Hindemith needs here!), can convey opposites best by rounding a strong middle. Excellent recording of a magnificent piece of music! The Faure nocturnes are well-played, intelligently drawn, making a nice effect after the Hindemith. Aldwell allows his pianism to flower rightly with the Faure, so that it feels wisely peeled off from the Hindemith that has just cleaved all the senses. It's a beautiful and pungent effect. Great CD - fetching version of 'Ludus tonalis' - engineering off the mark!

This is one of the great books of a lifetime, a book of soaring imagination, history, and some of the finest writing I've ever encountered. More Bach comes through in these luminous pages of a one-night encounter with Frederick the Great than is found in a dozen books of Bach 'scholarship'. While the book's 'premise' concerns Frederick's challenge to 'old Bach' that resulted in his composing 'A Musical Offering', James Gaines' exploration of Bach's mind and life and faith, and, indeed, his music, is so attuned, so wondrously rendered in the most engaging prose imaginable that any plot artifice is right away overwhelmed with a dire, burning truth, and never leaves it. It really is a book too rich to be 'reviewed'. Impossible? Check it for yourself. There are pages and pages of such fineness, such pleasure that one can only experience it, and be changed and renewed in love for 'old Bach'. One example - chapter 6 (The Sharp Edges of Genius), detailing Bach's famous funeral cantata 'Actus tragicus' (BVW 106), offers not only a brilliant summation of its musical parts, but is, immediately and ultimately, a moving, unforgettable rumination on the great meaning of Bach and his music, indeed, of the human experience in its divine dimensions unlike any I've come across. I'm a man lost for superlatives to express the importance, the resonating beauty of an amazing book. I've given this book to many friends, each in turn has confirmed my trust that this is one of the great books of a lifetime. You'll want for nothing within these pages - Bach's music, his towering mastery, his orneriness and orderliness, his divine business, and an unshakable look deep into our common human history. It's a book of discovery and confirmation. Evening in the Palace of Reason will change your life. No other 'recommendation' suffices.

In this recommended recording, Barber's exquisite cycle is the centerpiece and Upshaw sings it with youthful ease, a hallmark of her recorded legacy. It's a version of the piece that easily tops the others of note. I've not heard another rendition as approachable, thoughtful and musical. Like Berlioz' 'Les Nuits d'ete', 'Knoxville' inhabits a category unto itself as a song cycle. This is the kind of music Barber made his own, free and innocent, melancholic, with magisterial orchestration (reduced here) magically wrought by Zinman and St. Luke's. What a sound this ensemble has - an uncompromisingly measured sound free of ego and posturing. I admire them tremendously. The Menotti is a hoot! Upshaw's singing is wickedly ideal, stressing the punch and frivolity. She possesses uncanny musicianship for a singer, and is a generous singer obviously happy with chamber music intimacy. The Harbison takes it time but slowly gets under your skin and makes itself loved. The Stravinsky's the weakest bit, in my view. Well done but peculiarly unconvincing. I've treasured this disc for many years now and have not found another version that comes close.

These five volumes of Shostakovich's Complete Songs are simply astonishing. If admirers have with good reason found the private voice of the composer in his string quartets, there's another, perhaps more intimate voice to be found in his songs. Let this review stand for the entire collection - each disc yields generous returns. An entirely Russian production recorded in Russia, this is estimable treasure. If you love Shostakovich's music, the breadth of revelation found throughout these discs is overwhelming. Here is Shostakovich the man, genius, survivor, sufferer - but never victim. The works themselves are no less than a kind of eternal definition of art, an all-encompassing humanity borne by one man to our lasting benefit. The singing performances are uniformly excellent, as are the production values on every level, with fine sonics. Among the Russian singers who contribute, soprano Victoria Evtodieva, mezzo Liudmila Shkirtil, and the mighty bass Fyodor Kuznetsov stand out. Most of the songs are set for voice and piano. The cycles and a number of other songs use orchestration of varying details. Pianist Yuri Serov, besides distinguished playing, provides insightful commentary with each disc, ideal remarks full of detail - the title of this review is taken from his notes on 'The Anti-Formalist Raree Show', which he hails as '...a striking document of that bygone era, the evidence of a great witness.' What more fitting could be said of these amazing musical works and their composer? Full translation of every song text is included in each of the discs.

I have admired tremendously Ruth Ann Swenson from first hearing, her Mozart, her Rossini, beautiful accuracy, lightness - but this disc is a dud. Except for the admiration expressed for Swenson's 'Caro nome' (which sounds, frankly, like a bad student recital performance - of contemporaneous versions surely June Anderson's is supreme), I indeed agree with the previous review from Oxford. I would add that I detect definite vocal problems in Swenson's work on this disc. What is that extended and disagreeable flattening of the notes from top A-flat, A and up?? The voice starts to scratch faintly, and immediately one feels Swenson feeling it and fearing it. I actually started upon hearing it the first time- I thought Maria Callas had suddenly claimed Ruth Ann's voice in some mysterious embodiment! -over and over on this disc - most unfortunate! And Swenson's timorous, academic approach to nearly everything just grinds each aria to an emotional standstill. The problem is that I hear her showing me her singing, rather than simply singing. The antidote, for an attentive singer, is to listen to Caballe. Really listen.Listening to this disc brought me to a moment's reflection with respect to a number of opera recordings of late. Over-miked and under-conceived, produced for an elusive pop crossover market (now you have to be beautiful to sing opera, too!)-- all that is fine, but maybe a bit of MUSICAL understanding gets lost in the process, I don't know. I know this disc disappoints me. I wish I had all my OLD Ruth Ann sentiments back, but I just had to go in close, didn't I..! A beautiful instrument, and even a unique and limpid style of singing, of itself cannot garner a genuinely profound understanding in a singer, or any musician, for that matter, nor is it a meaningful substitute. That profoundness comes of humility not in the sense of ego, but in an artist's relationship to his art. I believe the unique canon of operatic arias is profound enough to warrant that much attention from a singer interpreting that canon. I wish that for Swenson, who has I think authentic musical gifts and sensibilities, but you wont find it on this disc. Listen to Caballe's recording of 'Al dolce guidami', Ruth Ann Swenson. Everything to aspire to is contained in its brief ten minutes.

Reviews are all over the map on this one. I got this disc to hear Kozena sing Ravel's Chansons Madecasses and to sample her Shostakovich. The Ravel is approached from a distance. It definitely lacks the atmospheric effluence of Jessye Norman's singing on her very early recording of it. It's a little dry here. The Shostakovich fares excellently with a crisp, taut singing dynamic that remains, to its credit, unafraid of vocal color. Great approach for Shostakovich's devlish songs that are wickedly difficult to possess. Kozena mostly succeeds there. (Also check out the excellent new series of Shostakovich's Complete Songs on Delos. Satires is on vol.IV, sung by Victoria Evtodieva. The complete collection is a revelation!) The Respighi's a fine piece classic in its proportions, and Kozena sings effectively but not completely freely. Britten's Charm of Lullabies gets an intelligent and modern, thoughtful treatment - the kind of treatment that seems Kozena's great virtue. She's bright and gifted, clearly going places and deserving to. For me, her singing seems inclined to substitute an idea about vocalism and a patina of involvement for the real thing - effective, but not always free. Still, it's amply satisfying to come across artists cooly wielding their careers, and their art, with supple intelligence and highly discerning results. Kozena is such an artist, and this is a fine disc of her art.

Beverly Sills not only survived being a child prodigy - a rare enough thing among singing musicians - she triumphed in a big way. Her fertile and beautiful art is wonderfully represented on this double disc set from Deutsche Grammophon. I sense today a resurgence of appreciation for her art, and to call it well deserved is saying the least. The singing's jam packed with pure musicianship, attention to nuance, fidelity to composer and character - in a word, everything requisite to making the operatic art thrive, qualities in short enough supply today among many opera stars, and it makes this package even more attractive. Sills not only understood bel canto art, she accomplished it memorably. Highlights include 'Ah! Tardai troppo...' (Linda di Chamounix), &an unearthly 'Regnava nel silenzio...' (Lucia), which I might prefer to Sutherland's for its committment and munificence. The gone too soon Thomas Schippers conducts a great performance - how that man could possess whatever orchestra and score he worked with. Two arias from I Puritani - especially 'Vieni, vieni fra queste braccia' with the singing of the genius Nicolai Gedda as Arturo, and an opening to Anna Bolena's aria 'Cielo, a' miei lunghi spasimi' that wipes clean every memory of other versions. All that on disc 1! I had forgotten Sills' beautiful pianissimos, singing so musicianly and free of ego - her interpretation is always only her adherence to score and composer, and greater praise cant be given a classical singer. Disc 2 offers a definitive version of Korngold's 'Gluck, das mir verblieb' (Die Tote Stadt) among a number of fine versions out there. The slowest version available and I feel I'm hearing it for the first time, and with a true Viennese (Rudel) conducting! You can put this track alone on repeat and live out the day in freedom! If you dont know Sills' art, or dont remember it well and truly, this set is a fine place to begin what will become transfixion with a musical art that proves itself urgent and inextinguishable! Highest recommendation.

Jim Marrs turns a plethora of facts, suppositions, coincidence, and indeed skullduggery into a book of conclusions. Whether these conclusions, documenting a vast, impenetrable, centuries-old conspiracy, are 'true', is perhaps less important than what it takes to get the world to believe that they are true. In this case, a little 'caveat emptor' goes a long way toward keeping one's head clear of the drain circling maelstrom being given its indictment within these pages. There is no doubt a good deal of truth to the author's conclusions with respect to an interrelationship existing between so-called &quot;secret societies&quot;, such a conclusion is, after all, acknowledged as being at least canonical, if not factual, even by mainstream historians; but the malaise which is appropriated to that nefarious concerted web is all Mr. Marrs' doing, however welcomed it may be by those wishing to explain the world's history by their own misfortune. As for the book's forays into extra-terrestrial territory, perhaps the less said the better. Here one finds explanations that do not beguile the modern thinker so much as confound him. What is the point of believing or disbelieving such extravagance? It is an axiom of human invention that warns us that when we discover the forces that have enslaved us, we have discovered ourselves. In other words, it is impossible to ascribe dark and malevolent powers to those who have enslaved us without naming ourselves. It is there that certain of the author's theories come to rest; dead, or at least dying, of their own extravagant desire to fill in the cracks of history with the putty of conspiracy. A book like this might have been a serious discussion of the nature of power, the desire that it engenders, the havoc that its devotees wreak. Instead, one finds a bit of comic strip approach, interesting in places, but falling into the trap of faulty logic, or no logic at all, revealing its weakness as human, to a fault. Still... one wonders how ELSE to explain the election of an idiot scion to the presidency of the United States in full view of the world, not to mention all those curious little sorrows that beset human life and remain astonishing and 'unexplainable' after millennia of recorded human history. Buy this book, just don't necessarily turn its scriptural pages with a literalist's predilection. There is much more to be said, and so very much more to be understood.

An essential book! Beals is a natural writer, and the crucible forging this story of the integration of Little Rock's Central High School is white racial terror in the South, its instigators and followers, its political actors (Orval Faubus &amp; Eisenhower), and its victims. The author spares no one in her indictment of the REAL story of the American South without ever raising her voice. There is too much humility to suspect that anything but the strict truth is told here-- and a brutal and harrowing truth it is. Anyone who persists in believing that the United States is justified in lecturing another country on human rights abuses should read this book! American schools may be 'integrated' for the most part, and there has indeed been substantial reckoning with respect to the destiny of people of color in this nation, but reading this book one inevitably meets head-on all that yet remains unchanged, unprogressed; one thinks of James Byrd, Rodney King, and so many others. All the same, there is a distinct peace that pervades its pages, one suspects it belongs to the author in full measure, bequeathed to her as an annointed inheritance by her grandmother India, especially, and her mother Lois. Much to admire here-- content, author, and perfectly modulated writing of the highest caliber. My high school daughter recommended this book to me, and that pleases me in what it says about teenage ideas of essential reading as much as does her sure solicitude for her reading dad. Read it and find unaccounted faith in the possibilities of the human spirit.

A really fascinating account of the split in the Karma Kagyu lineage. A great deal of detailed background information is provided regarding the events that have resulted in two claimants to the throne of the Black Karmapa. Lama Ole's international legacy of spiritual achievement speaks volumes, and that voice is significant. He seems to shun for himself a part in centuries of Tibetan political manoeuvering except insofar as any present machinations threaten or impede the mission given to him directly by the XVIth Karmapa. In the end, what does the controversy mean, does it matter? Buddhism holds in its means a rectitude to solve human conflicts, by healing individual lives. That has been Lama Ole and Hannah's life work. Is that disputable? Whatever else, practictioners must realize the wild human adventure in stories like this one. The book is literate, timelines are crafted with quick follow ease, and the tale it tells is, even through a great sadness, worthy of the Tathagata.

This classic book finds Merton in his burgeoning prime as a writer and at the emotional apogee of his monastic life; readying for ordination, and the subsequent unfolding of a spiritual path which he so fully lived at Gethsemani abbey, still true then, still pristine. Later, of course, things soured a bit, Merton's mind moved on, his spiritual understanding both widened and deepened. But the journal pages in 'The Sign of Jonas' are among the most beautiful on the block, infused with Merton's joy of religion, and with his magnificent prose. It's always seemed a daunting idea, if not impossible, to both describe the innocent and inevitable timbre of Thomas Merton's voice and to adequately praise it. We can lament that there is only so much Merton to read, yet one is flushed a bit with relief knowing that every page of every book contains the whole of his spiritual, not to mention literary, genius. 'Sign of Jonas' sits up at the top of the heap, along with 'Waters of Siloe' and 'Bread in the Wilderness', and the incredible 'Journals'. The geniality of the book is such that it becomes everything just to read his pages on the changing landscape at Gethsemani come winter, and the snow! Merton's intense Love is like a burning coal through to the end. Impossible to remain unchallenged in the face of this kind of perfect spiritual literature.

Peers' observation of Juan de los Angeles as 'the reverse of a dreamer' is well taken. A spiritual giant comparable to and more accessible than John of the Cross is revealed in this book. Fray Juan may be less rough than the great discalced mystic, but a spiritual language of delight serves them each in equal measure. Copious traces of St Bernard's practical sweetness run through Fray Juan's holy preaching, making the book easy to read and love. His is a sound and practical spiritual flight shorn of the extraneous.'The Loving Struggle' is one of (so far) three books called the Honeycomb Series, beautifully published by Saint Austin Press; the other two are St John Cassian's 'Monastic Institutes' and Louis de Blois' 'Comfort For the Faint-Hearted'. Nothing fainthearted about the spiritual brief of Fray Juan de los Angeles. This book will fascinate religious, and especially students of the school of Spanish mystics, but it's strong and wise enough to provide substantial increase for almost any seeker.

A perfect biography of one of the most celebrated and most interesting figures of the 20th century. The panoramic range of Huxley's genius is magnificently brought to life in this book. Everything is here- his historic antecedents, his famous family, his 30 yr. marriage to the beautiful Maria, the creation of his books, and not a little as well about his "psychedelic" period and his book "The Doors of Perception." Of course, Huxley is a marvelously inviting subject, intelligence and temperament combined in a man possessed of extraordinary natural gifts. The keen intellect of novelist Bedford is the key element; a rich understanding of Huxley's singular dialectic and his notably uncanny inner aesthetics makes splendid reading. The whole book is warm and true; the affection of the writer toward her subject is clear, but never interfering, never common or cloying. Bedford generously lets the reader walk and talk, travel and sup with Huxley, and her narrative skills are perfectly honed for such a daring operation; after all, it's one thing to merely write a biography of note, and another to unsheathe someone down to pure gold. The latter would seem to be Bedford's forte in these pages; it is a miracle of literary biography and an extraordinary experience. Highest recommendation without reservation.

THIS is the complete set of Mozart piano concertos to own and treasure for a lifetime. It's fascinating to hear Mozart's considerable development through the concerto form, and becomes much more with this collection of performances by Concentus Hungaricus and the bewitchingly thoughtful playing of pianist Jeno Jando. Add to that the stellar acoustic ambience afforded throughout by gifted Naxos' engineers, and you have a compelling set indeed. I turn to these Mozart piano concerto recordings again and again. I admire Maria Joao Pires' Mozart, and Gilel's great recording of the 27th, but these recordings surpass others in constancy, beauty, and especially tempi. The vital balance between orchestra and soloist is superior here. That delicate balance is always alive, revealing and assured - completely rewarding in every way. Any single disc of these concertos will give lasting pleasure, but listening to a string of these musical wonders is a revelation. Don't hesitate for an instant to purchase the complete set at this price. Jando uses Mozart's cadenzas for the most part, and that considered choice is the right one. Without question a musician's set of Mozart concertos. The orchestra dives straight to the heart of Mozart's amazing works, and Jando masters one revealing moment after another. What could be finer? This is perfect music making. A hundred stars and a definite recommendation. Life-sustaining music, and performances that express that where Mozart is, there is the divine art.

Kurth's satifsying book on Anna Anderson indeed leaves one puzzled in light of the subsequent DNA testing. I read this book before the tests were made, found it convincing, and still do. It seems that a more interesting question than whether this woman was the Grand Duchess Anastasia, is the question of why an obscure Polish woman would undertake a life of overwhelming suffering by claiming to be whom she apparently was not, since, whatever the truth, this affair was more than a charade performed by a charlatan. There remains a mystical element deep within the mystery of Anna Anderson, one which I suspect DNA testing is incapable of addressing. Kurth's exposition of his subject is well done, if a bit over-engaged. His love for the mystery of this woman over the mystery of her identity, for the recovery of the lost, and an almost fin-de-siecle ministering to the Romanov legend, makes the discourse a little florid in spots. But the prose is generally kempt, Kurth has a genuine intelligence, and the story is a captivating one. Kurth's humility in face of the declarations of science is admirable and makes one the more sympathetic, and baffled, by the outcome. This is a first-rate read, however, and I suspect history has not entirely played out the story of Anna-Anastasia.

An exquisite book in every way. Hamburger's arguments are spun with cosmic refinement, letting the whole mediaeval spirit reign human and beautiful, and focusing on its treasures - the mediaeval convent and the women religious whose work as artisans of devotion remains to this day an urgent interest. The story is unheard of, and soaked with succinct scholarship. The writing's uncommonly beautiful, full of intellectual fervor, but as mild as the Jesu of the women whose remarkable images still astonish after hundreds of years. The red Christ is a pure doctrinal exegisis for every age, and a real find. Hamburger draws the right relationship between the nuns' art, their lives of profession, and essential information about the religious' interior relationship to the wider Church throughout the high Middle Ages. His fondness for and ready assent to the vitality of the art of the nuns of St Walburg only shows his scholarship more clearly. Nothing gets in the way, and the illustrations from beginning to end are unforgettable. A large section of full color plates (including the red Christ) in the center of the book, and the vital b/w illustrations are closeup, and a critical part of a captivating story. We're told as much about our own age by this masterful book as we are the world of gifted cloistered women, and the implications of that are far-reaching.

While not the singular masterpiece that his &quot;The Queen's Throat&quot; remains, &quot;Jackie Under My Skin&quot; is an engaging, visceral, punchy romp through a classic American icon and an endearing ideal, while being at the same time a great deal more. Koestenbaum's theme remains the search surrounding our dilemma, he's a master of disguise that ends revealing everything . This book immediately goes under YOUR skin when you read it-- Koestenbaum's famous 5000 eyes see everything and keep everything balanced and bright. His literary sense is overpowering. The words leap and bite and nearly drown you sometimes. Koestenbaum's version of reality is clean and robust; this is a writer in jaw-dropping command of his thought. The prose is often downright shocking. Koestenbaum's preference to explore the threads of existence and suffering in a uniquely devoted way marks him out among modern writers, and he's an academic, as well; riding a single vein, a single notion, into the most perfect art, he is all about genius and the so-called redemptive aspects of literature, without ever leaving the most modern, most natural sensibility. His work is marvelous to READ. I would commend to you everything this fellow has written, especially &quot;The Queen's Throat&quot;, but this book on Jackie is awfully fine.

In one of the essential works of Christian ascetic spirituality, Baker's English recusant spirituality brings an oddly freeing severity to his religious aesthetic at every juncture; an outlook that is ever inward seeking, born whole out of a wild and beautifully impatient spirituality that has no perimeters short of bliss. By the purity of Baker's doctrinal whole cloth, Christian teaching attains a universal spiritual essence unlike that found within Aquinas' bindings, for example - one equipped with a wider, and thus less problematic, reach; an expansive conquest is the result, the contemplative asthetic full born and ready for the plucking. This book proves that deep is wide, and deeper is wider; and bequeaths, almost as if by birthright, the wide road of the heart fixed on attainment. Baker's teaching is constant, almost incessant, and rife with a dry and devout English care. Treasured by religious of many traditions, this is a one of a kind book of training for any wayfarer sincere in seeking. Mine is an older Faber and Faber edition which I've read many times through, and I'm scandalised at the price here - I suppose availability, and thus cost, is guided by public necessity. Would that more of us sought what remains, even in this astonished age, an antidote to barbarity, and a guide to the rooms of light.

If you can get your hands on a copy of this film you'll be rewarded with a beautiful look at Stravinsky the composer and a great deal of his music. I first experienced this fine film, called 'Stravinsky: Once at a border...', in a double VHS version, and only recently acquired the dvd from amazon. It is now listed as unavailable, a misfortune for those interested in the composer. It is one of Palmer's best efforts, with unforgettable footage of Stravinsky in Clarens, where he composed Sacre, in Venice and a number of other places, including his time in America. It plays like an extended conversation with the great composer. There are marvelous contributions from artists close to the original performances of seminal Stravinsky scores, and wonderful reminiscences from his children, especially Soulima Stravinsky. The composer himself speaks throughout much of the film - about his music, about Diaghilev, and some wonderful anecdotal stories of his experiences across an unbelievably rich artistic life. It's regrettable that films like this are scarce as hen's teeth to acquire - it says much about a society that devalues even the idea of culture, let alone its riches. Unfortunate, but nothing new in American life. The gems are out there if you're devoted enough to search them out. With Tony Palmer at the helm, I've never been disappointed at the effort that must be made. He is a filmmaker of inextinguishable vision and gifts. Highly recommended.

Beginning with Bernstein's profound recollections of Britten as "a man at odds with the world", this is a bittersweet, beautifully crafted portrait of Benjamin Britten and his wonderful music - such wonderful music, and so much of it included throughout the film. Tony Palmer is bar none the finest creator around of this kind of documentary filmmaking - splendidly rich and revealing, tautly edited, purposeful films that stride the virtually neglected genre like a colossus. Here is abundant footage of Britten's family detailing his 'perfectly ordinary' upbringing, all of it edited with taste and concision. At TT: 103 minutes, Britten's impossibly rich artistic and personal life is amply explored with the most sensitive affection, and much of that affection is centered on the music itself. Conversation with Peter Pears is front and center throughout, his commentary sweet and vital, intelligent and knowing. And plenty of Pears' singing too, his focused, inspiring, milky timbre forging masterpiece after masterpiece - fulsome footage, both filmed and live, of Peter Grimes especially, a number of pieces written specifically for him by Britten, and a good deal of 'home' footage of his time in America, and Venice, and the various locations along the eastern coast of England where he and Britten spent most of their life. Especially noteworthy are the long excerpts from Death in Venice, and Palmer twice visits a performance by Janet Baker of the cantata written for her by Britten, with Baker contributing some magnificent singing. Some champion moments come with footage of Aldeburgh town performances of the children's opera Noye's Flude, including Britten's own harmonious observations about children and music, especially his remarks about his desire to write 'useful' music for specific persons and occasions, a certitude he embraced throughout his composing life. One of the film's most beautiful segments comes with guitarist Julian Bream, alone in an English church, playing a piece Britten finally wrote for him 'a full ten years' after Bream first suggested it to the composer. The closing scenes surrounding Britten's death from heart failure in 1976 seal an unforgettable understanding of the beauty of a great man and his work. A Time There Was is stupendous filmmaking that brings fully to life the unique voice of one of the 20th century's greatest composers. Recommended without reservation. The world has lost its way, but we will always have the irreplaceable treasure of Tony Palmer's amazing body of films - something indeed to be grateful for.

As many of the reviews on this page testify, diehard Wagnerites live and breathe a world of their own when it comes to recordings of his monumental operas, especially Tristan und Isolde, and more power to them. As a musician who has resisted Wagner for most of my life, this recording - specifically the refulgent singing of Welsh soprano Margaret Price and the luminous conducting of Carlos Kleiber - is a revelation in every way, clearing away my every objection to the gigantic sound world of Wagner, and creating a kind of conversion to what this composer's music really means. I'm grateful for this. Price, whose singing I've long admired, is called a 'lyrical Isolde', a 'youthful sounding Isolde', an Isolde of 'beautiful sound' in contradistinction, apparently, to the Isoldes of Nilsson and Flagstad, hinting of course that Price's is an Italianate Isolde. Yet, when I read Wagner's score, I find Margaret Price inhabiting every corner of it with unbridled lustre of tone and committment, hardly something contraindicated by the composer. Indeed, hers is a fully human Isolde, noble, passionate, and surely one of this singer's finest performances on disc. I challenge any listener, even the most committed Wagnerite, to listen to her singing of Mild und leise wie er lachelt and find anything but a radiant exposition of a magnificent score. Margaret Price commits the wondrous act of warming Wagner all the way down to his human self, saving, not weakening, every ounce of his musical and dramatic intention, making it greater than many, even many ardent Wagnerites, ever imagined. She indeed forges new ground with her interpretation, revealing deeply Wagner's truth as an artist, despite whatever human flaws he may or may not have borne. As a result, Isolde is understood in a completely vital way, and so is Wagner's genius. It's equally clear that as supreme as Price's singing is she could not have achieved this amazing recording without riding on the gleaming musicianship of Carlos Kleiber, without doubt one of the last century's most revealing conductors. His attention to every detail never wavers, serves the magnificent whole, and the orchestra plays brilliantly. But then, every orchestra played brilliantly for Kleiber - such was his enormous gift. The combined effect is, as I say, worthy of a complete change of heart. With this recording, you will rediscover Wagner, new and shining. Rene Kollo sings Tristan with beautiful lyricism without sacrificing his bitter sadness. Fassbaender suffices, though perhaps Ludwig surpasses, as she usually does. The score, the score! Check the score itself as you listen to this discerning recording - you will find the Wagner of your intense longing! Highest recommendation, especially if like me you've resisted this music before in your listening life.

The two elements that uphold Dawn Upshaw's art are her riveting musicianship and her effortless and unerring artistic taste. Listening to her sing, one tends always to think of an instrumentalist applying her art, rather than a singer parading herself, so free of artifice and self-congratulation is her work. It seems that on no other recording of hers is this assessment more true than on this marvelous disc. The de Falla is wonderfully chosen as the opener, biting, with an almost corrosive undertone, and yet a lesson in perfectly balanced legato singing art. Ravel's setting of Mallarme's poems has never been treated more wisely than Upshaw's version here, in an ample expression of all the vision and complexity that characterises this difficult cycle. Only Jessye Norman's ravishing Ravel comes close to the beauty found in this disc's transcendent reading. If Stravinsky's beautiful `Japanese Lyrics' are hung like the moon at night, Dawn Upshaw is the night adorer. These three miniature masterpieces weigh out among the supreme offerings on this disc, Upshaw's clean, modern sensibilities perfectly matched to Stravinsky's tiny, divine `antidote' to his epic `Sacre', coming as it did directly on the heels of the completion of that epoch defining work. Though some have hinted that the Earl Kim cycle `Where Grief Slumbers', originally written in 1982, and here in the 1990 version recast for double string quartet, suffers from a musical language too intimate, too impenetrable to succeed, Upshaw makes a radiant case for this unusual song cycle. The oblique caress of `Listen to it rain', and the devastating romance of `Ophelia' would seem capable of convincing the most intransigent opponent of this kind of confessional art. Delage's mesmerizing `Hindu poems' finishes off a perfect recording effort with effortless perfection. The musicians on this disc are first-rate, and their contribution is clearly devoted to Upshaw's consummate, self-effacing art. This is ravishing musical art of the highest achievment. Don't wait to purchase this disc!

I don't know who reads May Sarton nowadays (hopefully at least students are still imbibing) for hers is a chosen art beholden to stillness and its plenitude, and we know the short shrift given to reflection in an oversized disposable culture. I do know that everything she's written holds magical lessons for every writer - her poems and journals are steeped in subtle lessons of patience, fearlessness and conscience. Plant Dreaming Deep (a title intended both as admonition and hopeful reflection) is a masterpiece. Part memoir, journal, survival guide, it's a kind of holy book for seekers searching the scrub of rocks and weeds. Sarton's intrepid gift has always been to secure for us the infinite contained in the small and unnoticed, to plant within the careful reader a kind of loving understanding to bloom unexpectedly farther on down the road, easing the load even as it deepens the search. Above all else, hers is an enlightening art that cannot lead astray. Quietly artful black and white photographs (of house and garden and friends - most by Lotte Jacobi and Eleanor Blair) are among the treasure found in the 1983 Norton paperback edition I own. Sarton's voice never fails; it's always rich and reasonable and true. It's easy to surmise that she's a overlooked writer, but if you really want what you're looking for, read May Sarton. Once born inside you, she's faithful to the end.

This second of Warner Bros. planned four disc deal with Lea DeLaria is captivating and fine. Once again, MUSICAL values are the driving force and the reason for the occasion. The provenance of the songs themselves is as far from the point as you can wander in the face of subtle and convincing instrumental work of a first rate band coupling the deliriously heart tuned singing of Lea DeLaria. The band assembled here is tight enough to succeed even without a singer! Seamus Blake's tenor sax work is consistently standout, busting loose on Morrison's 'People Are Strange'. Chris McBride's bass makes points as an emotional instrument rarely explored nowadays. Beautiful percussion effects on 'Alliance'. Gil Goldstein's arrangements (and his keyboard work) think and move and end up so right each time. DeLaria's singing comes more into its own on this second outing even if the first effort took on her home turf Broadway. Lea's ways are uncanny. There's an edge to even her tenderest moments, and you know she's right. Most important, she's a musician of rigorous standards, and that goodness rewards every track. A CD this fine smashes category, jazz or otherwise, the years will prove it. DeLaria's transformations of herself, her music and ideas about art meanwhile plunges forward. It's all good.Amazon reviewer Vincentelli writes "it's hard to shake off the impression that this is a stylistic exercise that gets caught up in its own self-aware coolness." She's unaware of the kind of self-awareness pervading Lea DeLaria's musical art, neither stylistic exercise nor in the least caught up (a spoiler, she means) but a vital part of the whole, a modern approach sampling homage and shunning imitation - indeed a coolness. Hip even, and hip's ALWAYS 'self-conscious' wanting you to listen, to see the new being born and answering in the end only to excellence. We all want perfect art from perfect artists, but Vincentelli's suggestion that authenticity is lacking is an uninformed shot in an otherwise leaden review. The natural force of Lea DeLaria's music overthrows all of that anyway. Get this disc and be multiplied.

J Scott Morrison has typically hit the nail on the head in his spotlight review. I've little enough to add except to say that Feldman's Piano and String Quartet is my absolute favorite Feldman piece. Among many loved pieces by this intriguing composer whose singular art marks the late 20th century as encouragingly fertile after all, for me, the Piano and String Quartet stands atop them all. I'm a musician and painter, and this is the ONLY music I ever allow when I'm painting. I figure this as maybe not surprising considering Feldman's well disclosed relationship to visual art. But at the same time, the Piano and String Quartet is music so whole it is impossible for it to play as 'background' music, thus it seems rather to afford a communion when I'm working, which quite says something to me about its importance. It's true that one of the great qualities of Feldman's scores is spaciousness. But even greater is the luxury afforded the written notes by that spaciousness. Music imbued with time, but time never for its own sake. Add to that the impeccable musicianship of Aki Takahashi whose playing, for me, opens entire new vistas of the feminine in art, and the indomitable Kronos Quartet whose jewelled work is ever new, ever important. Is there another opening to any score that rivals the first glass golden moments of the Piano and String Quartet? If there is, I've not found it. Feldman's scores treat the listener with abidingly profound respect. Nothing could be less true than that Morton Feldman's is music for aesthetes. Where that perception rises up, nothing is said about Feldman's aesthetic and everything dismaying is noted about a culture of immediate consumption that burdens us all. I also recommend to you Feldman's 'Give My Regards To Eighth Street' (I've yet to read 'Morton Feldman Speaks:') for miraculous insights about his work, and many pixie-like pages of humor and loving consolation. If you're looking for a passel of knowing commentary about Feldman's many scores, read Chris Forbes' absorbing reviews of many Feldman recordings in these review pages. I've learned a great deal from him, and am grateful for that. Begin to reap the rewards of truly listening. This is music so attuned it demolishes category, and reawakens hope.

The thing that makes Burroughs' confession so startling and new is flat out gigantic literary genius that's afraid of nothing and as supple as a fish. This book blew my mind and made me run to read Running with Scissors which is nearly as fine a book. It isnt really that Burroughs' genius isnt apparent, it's that it's so damn transparent - the pages burn with it but remain cool to the touch. He's a teacher and whiner and master pretender. I laughed out loud through most of it and wanted more when it was finished. I heartily recommend its brilliance to anyone fascinated enough by the mystery of literature's perfections to take on one its premier practitioners. The recompense is nothing less than each and every one of Burrough's ecstatic joys and sorrows.

The one Dickens novel I never read turns up in a brilliant realization from Andrew Davies, with mesmerizing characters and first-rate actors in another BBC success. Gillian Anderson refocuses her considerable acting chops to bring the luckless Lady Dedlock to perfect fruition. The relative scarceness of her scenes, and their critical importance to the story, makes her appearances even more tantalizing. The entire cast once again proves the English theatre tradition thriving, and is directed with consummate skill, and pride of detail. I love the redoubtable Pauline Collins as the quintessential Miss Flite, and Charles Dance is incendiary as the heartless Tulkinghorn. Anna Maxwell Martin (Esther Summerson) is a marvel to watch; she corners a self-assurance most actors only dream of, with ownership of every nuance of face and inflection - it's a huge performance of requisite Dickensian depth, perfectly tuned and delivered with the most gifted ease imaginable. It's worth every minute just to watch her copiously in her many scenes. Dickens' many minor characters never fail to justify their presence in his novels, however extravagant, and Bleak House has its profuse share. It's amazing how beguilingly the BBC has forged its remarkable history of mini-series of English literature; I can think of few, if any, failures. Bleak House is, bar none, one of its masterpieces. Nothing prevents an unqualified recommendation for an exquisite film experience more than worthy of the great Dickens.

This film has rightly been feted generously with accolades and prizes - it's a brilliant Idea, and a deeply affecting, memorable experience. Others here have shared the general premise of the film. I suggest wholeheartedly that it be required viewing for every living educator, it contains life-giving helpings of both seeds and fruit of the vast and intimate fields of purpose educators face every day in myriad ways. Tenderly directed by Hank Rogerson, copiously rich with a story of human beings finding redemption through Shakespeare's eternal art, Shakespeare Behind Bars is a one-of-a-kind jewel. By film's end, the 'bars' melt away in an ineffacable lesson about FREEDOM, miraculously enough, and very real human suffering finds a resonant voice in these prisoners who have never had one, a voice that shouts with hope. It is, simply, a film of joy in the divine power of human art. I've not encountered another like it - it sticks to your ribs and cleanses your mind. Don't delay the experience! Check it out - you'll be awfully glad you did.

Michelangeli's playing here is like the finest alabaster. Such playing! It's impossible to resist the pull of his beautiful world. I think the secret to loving this absolute musician is loving the composer he's playing, and it's never truer than with his Debussy. Gieseking is formidable, but Michelangeli's Debussy is opened up until there is no Other - only one movement, one thought. Michelangeli's is an holistic practice of Union, and aren't we lucky for that. These are irreplacable recordings in every way. This is piano playing of an extraordinary sensibility and simplicity, and it's not for everybody. Michelangeli loves the composer more than do many pianists, and it makes music's truth revolutionary. An unthinkable feast, but the gods be thanked. If you don't know this pianist's art, get these recordings, and prepare for wonder. Absolutely recommended.

Cotrubas explores new ground with this Violetta. Her unique sound is for some an acquired taste- well, then, go about acquiring it with this superb recording of Verdi's masterpiece. Despite the frequency of them, a memorable Violetta is hard to come by- exceptional ones seem to come and go, but a truly memorable one is difficult to find, and is a treasure when found. Verdi had no mercy when he wrote this role, the demands, both musical and emotional, are spectacular. Cotrubas seems not to notice, not to care, really, she will have Violetta her way, and it's the right way. This is no Anna Moffo sleight-of-hand. Cotrubas is not only an intellectual, but a humanitarian as well, and a musician, dammit, and that DOES matter so very much in opera, no matter those who wish it didn't. The peculiarly Middle-European tiimbre of her voice is perfect in this most lordly of soprano roles. I can't think of an opera I enjoy all the way through as much as this one, maybe Karajan's &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, but for audacity that rewards, this is the opera recording that delivers. The Kleiber effect is abundant and so appreciative of the score, as always, so beautifully thorough. Check out this wonderful recording and experience Traviata for maybe the first time.

One of Michelangeli's supreme recordings! The Images books sublimely wrought, a pianist of excruciating gifts with his mystifying inner world fully alive, and beautifully intimate sonics that are a model of restraint. What more can you ask for? Find me another recorded version of the Images to rival this one. Michelangeli gives us Debussy in gestures so natural as to be invisible. His Children's Corner is pure magic, profound, completely free; he proposes Debussy's as an art of revolutionary depth. Michelangeli's unerring conception is transparent and scintillating, richer than it appears, and ripe with truth. This is absolutely magisterial musical art in the throes of genius and high purpose. Discover the art of the gods. Overwhelming recommendation for a perfect recording.

This is a matchless version of Mozart's greatest opera. Everything is in place here in spades!- the finest orchestral ensemble on the planet playing under the irreplaceable guidance of that mystical genius von Karajan, in a recording that exemplifies the recording art with breathtaking sonics employed so wisely, so justly that one thinks only of Mozart! It is a remarkable achievment cemented by as fine a singing ensemble as I've ever experienced assembled for one recording. Sam Ramey's Don is without peer on the modern operatic stage. Such risks! so thoroughly vindicated! And he has grown into this consummate assimilation of the role with such humility and such assurance- there really is nothing comparable to his Don Giovanni. Shining in the role of Donna Anna is the legendary Anna Tomowa-Sintow, a Mozart singer of the highest caliber, so prodigal of voice, and so &quot;Karajan sounding&quot;, as the idea goes! Battle, of course, sings with characteristically limpid legato when you least expect it, creating an opulent Zerlina balanced like a sword point against the innocence. Incidentally, the filmed version of the Salzburg rehearsal by Karajan of this cast reveals a great deal of how Karajan achieved the level of musical interplay found in this recording. Furlanetto's Leporello is the perfect foil to Ramey's Don, and the casting of the two is the right one here, known as they are for liking to switch roles when playing this opera together! Agnes Baltsa is a good choice for Donna Elvira, if not everyone's ideal. It is, after all, a difficult role to cast, and one sees Karajan's thinking, in terms of ensemble timbre, the more one listens to the whole playing of the opera. Is it not one of the sterling comforts of our time that in Herbert von Karajan we have been privileged to experience not only a peerless musical intelligence, but to have experienced it at a time when, indeed because of his own extravagantly gifted devotion to the recording art, every nuance of his genius could be captured with an almost hypnotic clarity? Something indeed to be hugely grateful for. This recording comes as perfect art and has no rival.

Not exactly a groundbreaker in the biographical art, this book nonetheless gives an adequate account of the work of maestro Levine, if in the end very little of his real personal life. Why these books inevitably tend toward the mundane baffles me; Mr. Marsh plays the sycophant to the very end, and while controversy is not required to make interesting reading, it would seem to be a given, wouldn't it, that such unvarying adulation becomes a kind of flatulance after page 200-and-something. How often this kind of nonsense spoils what might have been an interesting look at a certainly worthy musician of our time! And Marsh is a relatively competent critic- one really expects more. This book however does manage to rise above the painful because of an extended interview section in the middle; Levine is a thoughtful and indeed a most decent chap, qualities that come through in his own comments, if not through his biographer's. Marsh is no David Dubal, however, and Levine is left pretty much to his own devices with respect to exploring his art in any substantive way. I should think he would be better served by an autobiography; Levine seems more inclined toward genuine experience than the fluff of Marsh's tiresome throes of ecstacy suggests. Not for the casual observer, but anyone with an interest in the history of the Met will find it at least not without some compensation for one's efforts.

Anne Sophie von Otter is a superlative singer, and one of the great recitalists of our time. This disc of late Romantic songs is but another confirmation of her exquisite gifts, combining true musicianship with vintage artistic taste. Central to the success of her recordings is her continuing choice of pianist Bengt Forsberg as her musical collaborator. These two artists perform together with uncommon empathy and understanding. The Berg jewels are the finest things here; von Otter's singing is as clear as a starry night. If you've never connected with Berg's music, take a listen to the Seven Early Songs; the 'Liebesode' and 'Sommertage' are spun with gold. Just marvelous in every way! Korngold's voluptuous art songs are in many ways a world apart from his overbaked orchestral music and operas, measured and cadenced with space and care. Von Otter's rendition of the 'Sonnet for Vienna' contributes mightily toward justifying whatever quasi-renaissance Korngold's music may be enjoying at present. This is just damn perfect art; it would seem impossible to be disappointed with this disc! Check it out!

The musical perfection of the recorded legacy of the Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Solesmes aside (and what a legacy - and how impossible to set it aside!), for me this is the 'ultimate' recording of liturgical chant. So much recommends the recordings of Solesmes - the exquisite singing, especially of that one anonymous tenor voice which alone seems to create the 'sound' of the entire schola!- the aristocratic liturgical taste of Dom Gajard, and now Dom Jean Claire, the genuine poverty of the monastic life at Solesmes (I've stayed there and seen it). While Solesmes pursues the vast body of Gregorian chant, here the monks sing chant from an earlier age, so-called Visigothic (Mozarabic) chant, not much heard before the liturgical relaxations subsequent to the Vatican Council II. These monodic melodies of Spain's Arabic past mark not only a musical beauty, but lets us to hear Roman chant in fresh light. While the Kyriale included in here may more exactly be called neo-Mozarabic, the main selections come from the period prior to Roman codification under Gregory, Spanish in heart, and universal in beauty: the remarkable 'Introibo ad altare Dei mei', various Antiphons and Prayers intrinsic to an older national liturgical ideal usurped by Gregorian legislation, culminating in the otherworldly 'Lamentation of Jeremiah', which once heard will never leave you. Recorded in the great Romanesque Abbey church, with an acoustic richly suited to the sung prayer of glad monks. If you love liturgical chant, get this treasure and enter a rich path of consuming fire.

Mr. McLellan's brief review for Amazon is dead on! Pierre Fournier's by now classic recording of the Bach Suites remains unchallenged, and the joy of the Kapellmeister is its everlasting motive! There simply is no rival to this rendition of these spiritual classics. The only other claimant on the horizon would be the version by Janos Starker; yet for all of Starker's understanding of Bach's invigorated masterpieces, I don't believe his conception is as cultured or his over-arching execution as fine as that of Fournier. The great assuredness of the Prelude of the first Suite is sweetened by Fournier's rich thought, and his handling of the Prelude of the sixth Suite, with its climbing 1-3-1-5-1-8 pattern, is so humanly drawn- like an illuminated letter in a Book of Hours! -well, as the French say, comparison is no comparison! The fifth Suite with its famous Sarabande hangs like a late afternoon in Sainte-Chapelle! This is art ineffacable and indispensable. Forget Ma's interpretation- he plays it like a schoolboy; Rostropovich is inconstant; Casals ends by offering more Casals than Bach; Heinrich Schiff goes deep but cannot be said to have wagered with Time itself in essaying these Suites - there is impatience in his probing version. Maisky, whose playing is always informed and beautiful, often keeps himself from the very joy that wings from Fournier's body and bow! Fournier doesn't perform, he holds court; and an audience with his Sebastian Bach is more rewarding by leagues than mere regal favor. Listen and be ennobled; here is art beholden to the gods.

What a singular treasure this La Scala Cosi continues to be, lo these many years hence! SIX principal singers who are actually Musicians! A conductor so rooted in the warming sunlight of Mozart that his work here is as perfectly natural and vital as breathing, and capped by a subtly stupendous set design by a gifted Mauro Pagano! And finally, a perfect score that will outlast time itself! Wow! What is there to criticize?I have never 'upgraded' my double VHS set to dubious dvd land. Thank god, apparently, given the whining on these review pages. Of course, I'm suspicious of audio-/videophiles in general, since rarely are they musicians who even reasonably understand the performance, let alone the MUSIC, they pontificate about. My VHS tapes continue to play splendidly (heroically, evidently!) after many runs through the old machine. What a capper to read you can purchase a single 'new' dvd version here for $205, or you can check out a 'used and/or new' VHS version beginning at $3.62. Sheeesh!... you'd think the seller who wants to unload his Cosi dvd for $200+ would at least have read the reviews claiming the transfer from VHS is something akin to degrading the human race. Ah...the sentient businessman!Whatever. If you want to experience the finest filmed version of Mozart's ensemble masterpiece, do yourself a real deal and pop for a VHS version offered by amazon sellers before they go extinct. You'll have purchased a bit of heaven, friends, and THAT's the truth.

Is there a finer experience than reading Thomas Mann? Death in Venice is his masterpiece, in my view (and arguably, one might add, Britten's greatest opera!), and, though the Russians come to mind, its pages, soaked in the majesty of the greatest art, reveal probably the greatest writing artist of the modern age. Aschenbach's passion is our own dilemma, and no other artist but Thomas Mann could leave him so lean and broken in our arms, and capable by that condition to fill us with consuming humanness. The philosopher Mann takes a language of human wounds and shows us ourselves, giving witness thereby to the essential power of literature. I consider it an act of religion to read Death in Venice every couple years. Religion is where, perhaps, we meet our heart; at the very least, art of this solicitude prompts a kind of faith that we still have one, after the wearing of the years, and all our private griefs. I hope the high schools and colleges are yet keeping Mann near, our children must yet gather and collect the food necessary to feed them all their lives. To 'recommend' this books seems almost pseudo-messianic! but if one commends it, let it be called not the work of a great literary messiah, but the cry of one of our brothers- a cry inextinguishable and provident.

An extraordinary book. One of Oxford University Press' 'Library of Latin America' series, translated from the Spanish by Helen Lane, here is a tome worthy of high praise. Fray Servando Teresa de Mier y Noriega (Mexico, 1763-1827), persecuted by the Inquisition for thirty years for his challenge to the colonial mentality and his willingness "to play an active role in movements of emancipation," Written in the Inquisitor's prisons, this is a topsy-turvy book where Europeans are the barbarians. Refreshing! De Mier was famed in his own time as a scholar and thinker, &indeed these 240 pages unsheathe a remarkable man, revealing with a novelist's succinct eye the true nature of the world and its passing, and our time in it. Impossible to overstate the beauty and severity of a spirituality in high bloom. Recommended.

The surpassing piano art of Emil Gilels keeps these Grieg miniatures free of sentimentality. Relying on lustrous tone, humor and breathtaking musical intelligence, Gilels sets an imcomparable standard wisely highlighted by chronological programming of his choices. The quizzical beauty of small music requires urgent musicianship of both composer and performer, something that defines this CD. I play it every chance I get. Gilels' playing is one of the wonders of the world; I'll always wish he'd recorded more repertory than he did. Thankfully we have this, his Mozart and especially his Ravel. Hard to be disappointed with a CD this fine.

I dont know who wants opera to look like this. Nobody I know. Both the design and stage direction hit below the belt with this ragger. I wonder what Puccini would say? I've seen Malfitano's Butterfly and Salome in the opera house and those performances were better than this. This is vocal struggle, fortunately with tricks to survive it all. She's an adequate actor, but misses the idea that operatic 'acting' is more effective as it grows more hidden, more subsumed in the singing. 'Vissi d'arte' is fascinating; flashes of pungent beauty and an unsought sense of doom come across effectively. Her Tosca is wildly committed. If that's all you need, you might like the performance. Lamentably, vocal luxury isnt a consideration with Malfitano. Richard Margison's Cavaradossi is sterile, forgettable. But Bryn Terfel's Scarpia positively steals the night. Just the right amount of juice, and the right kind. A malevolent, bewitching Scarpia that sings like a seraphim! We've waited for this. Too bad the rest of the production is a clunker. I'd say skip it, and pray Terfel recommits the role as effectively in another production less self-involved - or better, live! But no regrets here. I popped for it expressly to experience Terfel's vocally voluptuous villain, and got recompensed in spades. He burns up the role, and the singing's beautiful. For all Scarpia's menace, the honey just pours out. Bryn Terfel, and the gorgeous sound of the Concertegebouw raises two stars to four!

Merton is among those writers who profoundly affirm Wallace Stevens' fixation on 'the determining presence of the personality of the artist', speaking of the component values of any literary work. Published in 1956, 'The Silent Life' discloses a still undistracted Merton, brilliant and pure like a god. His unseen life as priest and religious, and a personal and abiding inclination for an intense eremitic life (his ever seeking the hermitage was a desire never really requited for him), color the emotion of his discourse here. It burns like the prose of 'Sign of Jonas' and 'Waters of Siloe'. It's a later, wiser Merton opened and deepened that arrests and shows us ourselves, it really is; but reading this book you're made to wonder if Thomas Merton was ever again so ecstatically fastened to the Ideal of his fantastically converted heart. Such a language of love to serve the most clement scholarship! &amp; best thing, it sings with all his determining love and confidence. Merton always expressed a particular affection for the pure hermits of Camaldoli, and the time he spends lovingly tracing their importance is one of the best parts of this book. Thomas Merton changed monasticism both by his devotion and his disaffection. This book's a good example of his already profound literary gifts, and an even better example of a man's purposeful race toward the God within.

I purchased the Manhattan Quartet's edition of Shostakovich's fifteen quartets as a boxed set of five CDs. I notice Amazon doesn't sell the set, rather individual CDs, certain of which appear to be no longer offered. That's a pity, because to really reach the heart of this amazing body of work, one needs to listen to the cycle of Quartets as a whole, if not at one sitting, certainly of a piece. Taken thus, these discs contain a recorded rendering of these masterpieces that is without peer. What the Manhattan String Quartet occasionally lacks in the sap of sage experience, it more than makes up for in clarity of judgment, and ardent unity of purpose. Clean, decisive playing that is lean and intelligent, and unafraid of Shostakovich's inner world, rather more often appearing to relish it, reinvent it, even cherish it in an unsentimental way. Not that the interpretation is stark, more that it is polished with requisite thought and attention to detail, enough to leave one in the arms of satisfaction, and yet hungry. Surely such is the nature of a kind of wild and noble ensemble playing perfectly suited to the wayward inner leanings of these so loved quartets. I think the earlier quartets are here the more successful ones, especially Nos. 4, 6 &amp; 7. The later quartets seem to suffer perhaps, and just a bit, from a kind of bitter distraction, without intending too harsh a criticism upon the point, though indeed the Fourteenth is redemptive. I have always felt Shostakovich's string quartets to be his &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot;, so personally truthful are they, almost to the point of being propitiary. The Manhattan String Quartet stages a compellingly beautiful whole liturgy of their incomparable parts. Highest recommendation!

It's interesting and helpfully instructive to read on this page an oboist's take on this Bach and the incomparable rendering offered by Glenn Gould. The idea that perception creates concept is perhaps in no other instance as true as in assessing the idea of Bach's music. Bach's place in the musical world is as strong as it's ever been, and Gould's hand in that formidable reformation is embodied perfectly in this recording. Having survived the scourge of Enlightenment, it's taken long enough to convince musical pedagogy in particular of Bach's melodic instinct and its place in his vast transforming musical schemata. For all his staccati, humming, fingertip technique, invention of ornamentation and tempi, Glenn Gould ALWAYS affords listeners an unshadowed look into the life of melody in music, and is therefore a natural Bach interpreter. Gould never played the piano as percussion instrument, rather always as an instrument for singing (indeed often ceding to his own singing the edifying glory of counterpoint) and THAT, notwithstanding all else, makes his Bach life-giving and bequeaths to us a Bach for all time. Over and over again I'm struck by the golden reach of Gould's intent here, an intimate resilience and candor rivaled perhaps only by his interpretation of the Toccatas. This is not prescription Bach, and for that it eternally beckons and feeds us. Let the faint-hearted become strong! Recommended without reserve.

Cheever says "I am fifty-four, but I still think myself too young...to suffer nightmares about throughways and bridges." Daily peril is ever close at hand in the self-abusive pain and duty of the observed life of a 20th century master of English prose. The only peril in reading this book is a broken heart. I would stand anywhere and say there are paragraphs in these journals that rival in beauty and perfection any other in English literature you may produce. Cheever can't help it; this kind of genius is inevitable. What does it matter that misery formed a life? The pages written in Italy in the late '50's, especially, nurse a kind of transparent abiding of deep misery - seeking, arranging and soldiering it, all the while writing, fortunately for us. However alcohol and inner troubles may have crippled aspects of Cheever's career, nothing but glory shadows his paragraphs of light! The book is more like an autobiographical duel in the form of a novel, so raw is Cheever's self-reaching, and so moving his conclusions. Barely able to escape the intense life of the mind, Cheever's art almost threatens confessional literature by refusing to confess. He keeps his writer's mind, and makes the rest serve. As a result, the book full of a beauty that will never disappear. It's a worthwhile idea to get a copy just to read the paragraph written in 1981, after taking the dogs walking deep into the rainy woods, returning & listening to Bach's Concerto for Two Violins on headphones, while the wet and muddy dogs dry on the porch. It's an amazing book by a peerless writer.

I first came to Szymanowski's music through his chamber music and his beautifully atmospheric liturgical pieces. Born in a part of Poland that's now part of the Ukraine, Szymanowski's music was not immediately taken up by his Polish compatriots during his lifetime, but there seems to be a worldwide burst of enthusiasm lately for his music, long overdue and well deserved. Influenced as a composer by Scriabin, Debussy, and of course Chopin, Szymanowski's music remains tonal, but imbued with a shifting sense of loosening the moorings of classical harmony and outline, breathing extraordinary new impetus into the still nascent Second Viennese School that was yet to come to full fruition. This recording of the Violin Concertos and the accompanying Nocturne and Tarentella should go a long way toward securing his evocative, highly individual musical voice a vibrant place in the mainstream of classical music performance. The First Concerto, especially, reveals explicitly much of what makes Szymanowski's music a constant surprise, rewarding, thrilling, even sensual. First, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka's violin playing is stunningly fine. He consistently reaches into the music with intelligence, and the recorded sound is beautiful. Highly atmospheric conditions of the piece are never allowed to drift toward the slightest falsity. Here is a first-rate fiddler! And it's hard to praise highly enough the playing of the Polish State Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Karol Stryja throughout this entire recording. What an orchestra, and having encountered Stryja's work before, what a conductor! Finally, the sonics here are really special, something that has become a praiseworthy standard of Naxos' remarkable recordings. Classical music recordings would be impoverished without the impeccable contributions of this label. Recommended with real enthusiasm, coupled with a recommendation to check out additional Szymanowski scores, especially his wondrous Lieder Der M&auml;rchenprinzessin, the consistently satisfying piano works, the well known Third Symphony, and his chamber music scores. The Violin concertos in this recording are a perfect place to start a wonderful journey of discovery.

With the exception of Yehudi Menuhin, it's best to approach the autobiographical excursions of great musical artists with more than a little skepticism. How many disappointments have flown into the meadow by that route! This engaging effort by Isaac Stern is therefore a more than little delight, filled with the characteristically notable voice of one of the authentic humanists of the 20th century, not to mention one of the great fiddlers of all time. Stern's writing is great deal like his playing; verve and confidence riding the high clouds with surety and an unmistakably personal passion. I often thought, while reading this book, how no one in my experience plays Kreisler's 'Schon Rosmarin' like Stern -for all the salon qualities of the piece, it has a heart of pure gold- and this book resembles that little encore nugget in more than a few ways: true, one wishes at times that Stern would simply go on with his thought, go on with the memory at hand, even with the discussion at hand; yet in many ways he keeps up the flavor of his reminiscences by the succinctness, and at times almost the distractedness, of his writing/speaking style. I would argue that in fact he does give us quite a bit of his way of looking at not only his own life, but the wonder called the human experience, it's just that with this man one simply wants the conversation to go on and on. Even when speaking of his children (which he does often, even including charming transcriptions of little tape recordings of Daddyspeak for his wife and children when he was so often away on tour), Stern's power to captivate arises full from his honesty, indeed one of the great attributes of his music making. Chaim Potok's hand in the affair seems somehow deep under, and therefore probably pervasive and beautifully wise (as is every Chaim Potok effort!), leaving Stern's voice alive and vibrant, humanly awkward at times, and always surprising in its direct power- very much like the playing of this most gifted of musicians. Despite the obvious limitations that will always attend a book like this, it remains a delight, charming if not all revealing, even moving. Lovers of music won't be disappointed!

The fabled set of mystical narratives composed by St Gertrude, and the addenda committed by her nuns forming the second half of the book, together comprise one of the crown jewels of mediaeval mystical literature. The relationship between Gertrude and her sister St Mechtilde becomes one of the pillars of the book, and keeps watchful witness, proving itself central in understanding Gertrude's mysticism. A genuine garnering of the goods Gertrude offers, however, seems imperiled, since only the literalists are any longer interested in publishing these works, though not all scholars lost contact with them over years of de-listing. Interesting that those who read Gertrude insubstantially WANT to read her thoroughly, while those able to fathom Gertrude's genuine mysticism have fallen prey to mere academy mind, without a true scholar's heart for the blood and bone of a saint's mystical art! Gertrude's is an especial art: laden and drenched and bottomless and cold and lavish and you're not permitted a second's respite from all of that, but still she prevails. A loving heart prevails - and some ineffable philosophy - and a sumptuous rendering of another world... It's a marvelous accounting of things mystical, however you read it, but without disinterested teachers, the subtle light coursing through Gertrude's temple runs risk of disappearing under less subtle shadows.

Like many reviewers here, I find that words can but inadequately describe, let alone praise the beauty of this film, a film that engenders unquenchable joy at life and its limitless possibilities. A work of exquisite agony and restraint, desolation and power; it is as surely a film that could come only out of the enormous spiritual canvas that is Russia as it is a tale that writes the deepest human motives with unbearable ease and simplicity. The performances astonish, particularly Pyotr Mamonov's Father Anatoly. Lungin's breathtaking, heartbreaking direction defines the art of cinema's immense responsibilities so rarely met; visually wrought like a painting, this is art as spiritual food. It just doesnt get any better than this. Tolstoy's vision of a redemptive art is moved to a consummate plateau here. What a gift for our desperate times, for all time.

Northern style, Southern style, Sicily - these are magnificent DVDs! Nothing's lost by not being at street level wandering through each town, and real richness is afforded by the incredible vantage point. The approach is immediate, pristine and measured. Even as the HD camera sweeps patiently across land and sea, you find yourself down in the heart of a particular town, then you move on. The adventure purrs along! A favorite moment comes the early part of the Southern Style film, the camera moves across the waters of a bay and Connie Francis sings Ritorna a me. It's a moment ripe with memories of Italy - and an hypnotic mind bender! Some reviewers have said narrator Franca Barchiesi's voice is too soft. I'd say seductive rather than soft, and it's good she underplays the narration, because watching Visions begets a listening mind, and the rewards increase in proportion. The music selections are crucial, and handled with care. Beyond the visuals, Visions makes great music for working at the computer. PBS plays these gems nearly every pledge, and I watch them every time they show; now I dont have to wait. For sheer thrill, you cant go wrong with this set. The Sicily video is less interesting, a male narrator seems to read without much engagement, but the visuals are fine, especially the lingering over churches.

The musical supremacy of this Aida is substantial. I'm a musician indifferent to the culture of opera, but never the music, which is what reigns here, and Verdi wins for that reason. Navarro conducts like a sphinx with preternatural instincts of ensemble, and of Verdi. Near perfection ensues. The reason for the season in my book is the singing of Margaret Price, pure and simple. She transforms Aida from the run of the mill we accomodate, and that by god-given Musical means, as opposed to extra-musical - the whole of the wonder right there! There's not a lost moment of singing in the entire performance. Incidentally, she similarly reveals Isolde in her recording with Kleiber. She looks uncomfortable in her costume, but the singing pours out, castigating as insignificant every extraneous imperfection. She's an impeccable singer; musician first, and instrument second. Re stage design, I get the argument about lavish, &I guess it applies here. What do people think an opera production of Aida should look like?? Dont answer that. Disappointment doesnt come with this Aida. Beautiful (as usual) film direction by Brian Large. Big recommendation for musical reasons.

Azar Nafisi's superb intellect is matched on every page of this book by her watchfulness and bravery, and the combination makes for fine reading. It's difficult to overstate the importance this book might have for the West, for women AND men, and especially for young people, students. Nafisi's story of her 'secret book club' strikes notes of a parallel challenge immediately understood by the watchful ones in America, particularly, where disinclination to confront the tightening grip of the theocratic bullies of a notorious political right wing is still on the upsurge. The author is unafraid of self-examination, and her instincts, both moral and literary, are impeccable and essential. Recommended to me by my college daughter, it took me a long time to get around to reading this book, now I'm grateful I did. It's a moving and celebratory affirmation of life and freedom not to be missed.

This is a first-rate book, made important by intense and impeccable scholarship, and as well by genuine devotion on the author's part (himself an Orthodox Christian and an academic). William Bush's unadorned and concentrated understanding of the mystery of sacrifice hands this book a beautiful and finally essential aspect in revealing the holocaust of sixteen nuns against even Reason - Who bore the sons that made the madness. Bush wisely makes a book about more than religion and murder, and creates a perfect moving stream out of tidal events, making an awfully effective read. He takes especial pains to dissect the coming about of the holocaust from the view of innocents; the proposition of the choice to be made, the preparation, he even enters the interior lives of the Prioress and Mistress of Novices - aristocratic women living out the literal meaning of privilege. By keeping to the truth, Bush proves these women's gain of discernment and transparency, the silent witnessing so despised by the disciples of the Terror. This is a big book in a relatively thin guise. The author makes too much of the importance of Gertrude von Le Fort's fanciful tale, but his own commanding scholarship speaks for itself, and nothing can diminish the effectiveness of a magnificent effort. The cover bears a daring and beautiful photo of an oblation scene from a production of 'Dialogues of the Carmelites'.

This book's been alternately excessively hyped and criticized. Some of the reviews on this page make me question whether those reviewers and I read the same book. The book's arch premise is highly focused (not simplified) in order to successfully posit its all-embracing point: human beings are ignorantly destroying the world in which they live. It's not a book about a return to primitive man, neither is it about ideas already understood by most people; if that were the case, corporate greed, mindless militarism and fetishistic destruction of the environment would not be the cataclysmic problems they have assuredly become. There's a good deal of honest wisdom in the pages of Ishmael despite the quasi cultic aspects found on the ishmael.com website. This is a book that can help teach people in this society to listen. THAT's its erstwhile contribution. Try this experiment sometime: note how often you experience someone say they "listened to" something (a book, another person, the circumstance of any human quandary) and contrast it with the number of times you hear people say they "heard" something. The results of this simple little survey will astonish you. THAT's the value of the tale of teacher Ishmael. Until any society that measures its wealth by consumption is converted to a culture that listens, any hope for the necessarily radical reconfiguring of the means and the end is a pipe dream. The book addresses that condition with insight, a superbly original idea, an intriguing 'hero' and a genuine push for a wakeup call that fairly charges out of the author from beginning to end. Great literature it ain't - a critical choice is what's revealed, and it's powerful.

At TT67:25, this is one of the longest recorded versions of the All-Night Vigil available, and suffers from an almost lugubrious darkness throughout. Recorded in Smolensk Cathedral in 1986, the sonics are mediocre at best, and the heavy pacing allows very little interior light to emerge from the performance. The balance of the voices is capably wrought throughout, but subdued to extremes. Given the evidence at hand, it's a mistake to believe that a Russian choir will automatically create a superior Vespers, however much one might wish otherwise. The Shaw version is clearly superior to this offering, basses included. The basses here are weak in their most famous passages, with an odd, spread sound increasing as they descend to the low Bflat. Disappointing. A major detriment of this recording is the singing of mezzo Irina Arkhipova, whose middle voice can't wait to forsake the character of the music, delivering lines with a self-involved operatic timbre which at best is misplaced, and often downright distracting. This is unfortunately true of Olga Borodina's solo turns on the Nicholai Korniev (Evening Star) version as well. Victor Rumyantsev's tenor solos are adequate but unremarkable, especially compared to Karl Dent's beautifully tempered singing on the Shaw recording. The accompanying liner notes mention that conductor Valery Polyansky studied with Gennadi Rozhdestvensky, but, in this recording at least, he displays none of that master's absorbing muscianship. The notes contain no text of the Vespers, but do afford two wonderful photographs of Rachmaninov (one with his two daughters) at Ivanovka. There are so many fine recordings of this music, I recommend skipping this one.

The Operatunity competition, shown on PBS' Great Performances', was a class act, a really interesting idea that culminated with verve in a great success! I hope somebody puts it on dvd. This disc of the two winners of that operatic adventure is an introduction to two fine singers. Gilchrist has the more possessing instrument, not only capable of but seemingly born to a legato line. Her voice is the more Italianate of the two, and her singing soars. She's surely the more assured singer of the two. In fact, her inner assurance as a singer is astonishing, given she was working as a checker in an English supermarket when she entered the Operatunity competition. Amazing stuff. Leigh's voice is arresting, and often beautiful. She recalls a young de los Angeles in some ways, mysterious timbre, at times exhibiting a wonderful otherworldly quality. Her 'mio babbino caro' has beautifully lean lines and lustrous singing. The selections are well chosen, and the engineering is especially well done, with fine balances and loving attention to the singers. The whole disc is a kind of well sung opera primer, and picking up a copy will help the beginning careers of two fine singers.

The authors of this book are worshipful, but that's about all. What a disappointment, especially as it's the only extant full-length biography of one of the colossal singers of the twentieth century. The first third of the book concerns itself with Caballe's beginnings, and for the most part is interesting enough, at least to the hopelessly seduced fan, but it soon becomes a week by week itinerary diary of the most mundane kind. Madame sang such and such at this place, caught a plane to such and where, sang this and that at such and such opera house....on and on. Only occasionally is there even an apparent flash of genuine interest on the part of the authors. A writer of conscience could certainly create a worthy biography of Montserrat Caballe, after all, her body of work is the stuff of legends, but this half-cooked effort really demeans the biographer's art. The elements of abiding interest surrounding Caballe, the voice itself, her miraculously docile character, among a number of other standout elements are treated shabbily in this book. A useful complete discography is appended at the end.

I recall with pride the sure comfort, during the years of struggle against the American war in Vietnam, afforded by Bertrand Russell's pungent opposition to the same war for the same reasons, all of his astonishing intellectual gifts poised like a sword against the daily lies and betrayal of ideals perpetrated by Washington. While Russell's mathematical exegeses are beyond me, the thrust of his intellectual activity has remained attractive. This concise book (indeed thin, but not incomplete), while not diminishing that attraction, comes a bit like a diatribe exposing those elements of Russell's character that were no doubt conflicted, and yet were more likely an integral part of his intellectual capacity. Ryan's writing is informative, but not terribly appreciative. One feels distanced by Ryan's doubts, rather than educated by his conclusions. Clearly Russell was a complex fellow, inconstant and, in a certain respect, embittered by a life of singularity; it seems however that Ryan does little to penetrate the conflicts down to the bone of understanding them and integrating them into the whole picture of Russell's turbulent life, rather he presents the externals as elements sufficiently interesting in and of themselves, a disservice, I think, to one with a legacy as lingering and controversial as that of Bertrand Russell. The prose is intelligent and clear, and the volume is a typically attractive Oxford Univ. Press offering, small and supple, the presentation suiting the book's tone and content perfectly. I recommend this volume, but it's not everything it could have been.

The tempi taken in the three concertos, but especially in the Double Concerto, are so fast and trivializing they rival a Bugs Bunny chase scene. I expect more musical discretion from Gidon Kremer. Derisory speed, an inclination towards classical superfluousness, a lack of rhythmic centredness - these are not marks of "authentic" performances, wherever that spurious idea happens to sit at present. In fact, some of the best original instrument recordings are those that find authenticity in moderate tempos. The Bach Collegium Japan's recordings are a supreme example of this - beautifully recorded performances suffused with Bach's musical spirituality. I've nothing against original instrument performances (unfortunately, these are not), but there is lamentably an idea amongst some musicians that speed indicates a new vision. I say I expect more from Kremer, but he is, after all, playing with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields orchestra, a money making machine in classical music recordings that seems to offer more than its share of characterless MUSIC making. Maybe Kremer's just making a fast buck, but it's disappointing Bach. A good alternative is to check out Oistrakh's and Stern's recorded versions - rhythmic cohesion and a rewarding MUSICAL understanding of these amazing concertos.

The best thing about this 2disc set is the inclusion of most of "It Is Finished", a solo disc unavailable for too many years. Nina's version of Kumbaya - a song that is often the butt of musical jokes, and deservedly so- in its reinvention here called "Come By Here, Lord" is alone worth twice the price of this collection. The folk fluff of the original is forever eradicated and in its place stands an ineffacable creation of epic dimensions, fired joyfully and defiantly by Nina's remarkable piano work. The genius of this woman is always undeniable, but there is an almost startling aspect to her transformation of the mundane here. I doubt Simone has ever essayed a finer version of Bessie Smith's "Sugar In My Bowl" - she and the audience both know it, and now so do we. The profoundness of Nina Simone's burning humanity is present in virtually every track on these two CDs. You can only add increase to your own by listening to these recordings, no matter what you might think your musical interests are.

This Glyndebourne production reconfigures the grandiose in a classical, understated stage design by John Gunter, with Peter Hall's munificent eye and Glyndebourne's legendary devotion lavished rewardingly on matters musical. Glyndebourne is Marie McLaughlin's best house, I've seen her there a number of times. Her Violetta here is surely more than adequate, overall a beautifully finished performance. She's an overtly careful singer, with never hurried phrases always musically characterized. The pathos of Violetta's predicament comes ever more realised as the piece progresses. The letter scene in Act 2 is one of the more beautifully sung in available video versions. The real surprise is tenor Walter MacNeil, who sings Alfredo with notable musicianship and a magnificent instrument. This is pungent, Italianate singing you'll remember for some time! Beautiful pianissimos in some of the most passionately musical singing I've ever heard. Brent Ellis sings Giorgio Germont with royal ease and astonishing baritonal beauty. His duet with Violetta radiates with sadness, and again, like MacNeil his singing art is remarkable for its contentment with Verdi's already dramatically furnished score. These are the possibilities of opera! Haitink is his customary supportive boring self, but in an age of uber conductors 'conquering' the opera pit his approach stands the test of time, at least here. Across the board, the singing in this Traviata is excellent. My 1988 VHS version has subtitles, can't speak to the dvd transfer. Check out the used VHS prices! I've never been stiffed buying 'used' from amazon sellers. This is a worthwhile Traviata.

This is a perfect King's Singers recording filled with Christmas music. The sustained success of this group of six English gentlemen is legendary, but not surprising. The ingredients for that success have remained the same for many years, through varying personnel, and across a very wide-ranging repertory of a capella music. First and foremost, these men are true musicians - musicians first, singers and interpreters second. Musicianship consisting of equal parts learning and attentive transmission, the King's Singers are immaculate musicians - attuned, commited, ready, and fortunately blessed with musical intelligence to guide their choices of material. Second, and as important in my view, these men are comrades. In their recently released DVD, one finds abundant evidence of a committment not only to their art, but to each other. A capella singing by nature revealing, you'll find no seams in the singing of this mastergroup. Everything is seen to, raised up, compelling - and ever beautiful. This is authentic art of the gods. As fond as I am of Chanticleer, and of Harry Christopher's The Sixteen, the work of those fine ensembles pales when compared to the lingering beauty of the King's Singers. Constant invention is one of the hallmarks of their recorded legacy, and is bountiful on this disc - voicings, approaches, and a magical communion of voices. Check out Ariel Ramirez' instantly amenable 'La peregrinacion' and you'll never turn back. Big recommendation.

Having been an admirer of Slate magazine's 'Complete Bushisms' page for lo these many months, how could I resist picking up this printed collection? 'Dubya' doesn't get any stars at all because the man is an imbecile, but Jacob Weisberg wins 5 big stars, the kiss, the kit and the whole kaboodle for the sheer invention of cataloging these revealing utterances of the 43rd President. A compendium of little horrors - what a droll idea! Unfortunately, the invigorating aspect of mulling over the living theatre offered in these pages stops with a thud upon realizing that the nightmare isn't vanishing after all, that it really has moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; frankly, it takes one's breath away. The only known antidote to the terror engendered by reading this collection of Bushisms is to read one of Lynne Cheney's books. Having forced myself to finish her repellent &quot;Telling the Truth&quot; by arduously clinging to the dictum that one is forearmed by knowing the enemy, it would seem that I've undergone a conversion, as I now find myself praying that nothing happens to make Dick Cheney the 44th President...

An interesting Turandot, beautiful to watch - the design and especially the lighting make it something special for the eyes. Not so much for the ears, although I warmed up to Luana deVol's Turandot as it progressed. It helped to have first watched the mini-docu about her in the extras provided. It made me believe more in her artistry. She owns a hardworking and not particularly beautiful voice, more hardy than rich, but she's an able actor, and her committment carries the day. The riddle scene, despite its lack of vocal lustre, is a convincing piece of operatic art. Filmed live at the Liceu, the recording balances arent all they could be. When the singers are downstage, the sound is robust; as they recede upstage things become troublesome. The sets are lit beautifully, expressing an holistic, at times visionary, approach to the story. Tenor Franco Farina is only sporadically standout, and mostly seems to struggle with Calaf's big moments. Barbara Frittoli leaves a lot to be desired after hearing Caballe or Mitchell sing Liu, but she makes do. Get it for a beautiful looking show; it's survivable vocally, if far from ideal. Not in a league with Marton's Vienna Turandot with Maazel (the best of her versions), this DVD has its merits even if great singing isnt among them.

These two volumes are worth their weight in gold! Together, they cover a period of nearly eight years in the life of Roshi Jiyu-Kennett, an Englishwoman, and one of the first Western women to successfully train in the monasteries of Japan. The first volume, titled 'The Diary of a Zen Trainee' covers her difficult early training up to the time of her priesthood, her constant physical maladies, the incredible rigor and hardship of her stay in the monastery of her teacher, Keizan Zenji, and her wretched treatment at the hands of the Japanese monks. Kennett is a natural diarist, and a clean and direct writer. The second volume, &quot;Diary of a Female Zen priest&quot; is even more engaging than the first; her Dharma transmission, an expansive look at her time spent as priest of her own tiny temple, her relationships with the Japanese people and clerics, everything is composed with insight, no superfluity, and plenty of humor. The two volumes conclude just prior to her founding Shasta Abbey, a still flourishing Soto Zen abbey and training center situated at the foot of Mt. Shasta, in California. It seems impossible to praise these volumes sufficiently. Roshi Jiyu-Kennett was a woman, priest, musician, intellectual, inveterate Westerner, and a person of extraordinary courage, determination, skill and spirituality. She was, as well, a naturally gifted spiritual teacher, and these diaries are among the most enlightening records of the transforming of a human soul that I've ever encountered. I wish so much that she had diaried in the same way her experiences as Abbess of Shasta Abbey - what an increase of treasure it would have afforded us all.

This is a wrenching book of profoundly honest and searching scholarship unmatched in published literature about North Korea. Bradley Martin's reporter background serves him well throughout - there is not one page in over 800+ pages that derives from a dogmatic bias; I believe he has the intelligence to realize that a 'just the facts, ma'am' style is clearly the most effective means of revealing the inner truth about the Kim dynasty and the situation in North Korea. Martin's extensive travels in North Korea serve him well in reaching beyond a framework of historical fact to form a vital and unique aspect of the book's success. The opening third of the book devoted to the rise to power of Kim Il-Sung is noticeable in its strict fairness with the facts, an admirable restraint indeed, and the book gets off to a good start because of it.The following chapters on Kim Jong-Il are equally revealing of those aspects of North Korea that presently concern the rest of the world. Martin goes out of his way to extend to Kim Jong-Il a full treatment of his not inconsiderable theatrical and musical gifts - something many writers would not and do not do - and the terror of the Stalinesque munchkin's madness is made all the more compelling for it.I do think the book is overly lengthy. Reaching the sixth or so multi-page transcript of interviews with North Korean defectors I felt enough was enough. Nothing uniquely viable is being presented by that time, and while one can respect whatever reasons Martin had for such extensive interview minutiae, it becomes somewhat wearying. That is, however, a very minor complaint against a many faceted, enthralling, even exhilarating portrait of a sad and dangerous country. This is the book to read on North Korea. Enthusiastically recommended on all counts.

I've loved this book for more than 30 years. It's not that Merton's an extraordinary poet-- he isn't. He makes beautiful poems, not extraordinary ones; but even a rascal can admire the fortifying intelligence that makes everything Merton writes important. It's not even the customary New Directions production-- immaculate and free, sure and devoted, as always. An American treasure this publishing company is! Included is a devoted, even loving, appreciation of Merton's poems by poet Mark van Doren (I dont know if it's found in the Collected Poems). Love for Selected Poems endures because it's from his poems that Merton incontestably emerges as a soul in the form of art. His faith is his art. Nothing's stronger-- not criticism, inscrutable public thirst, Cistercian censors.. There are intense and nearly infinite layers to Merton's prose. The poems are naked. He knew they must be and he allowed them to be naked. &quot;..All the curtains are arranged/Not for hiding but for seeing out..&quot; The poems are Merton's home. It's to his poems that he'll take a homely idea and make it strong, and take a unmonked sentiment and give it shelter. Merton's humanity NEVER has to fetch a witness in his poems. He stands there willing, even unpolished in his glaring humanity at times, drawing as pure hearted a breath as a man ever drew, and prayer in the form of poems you could diagram a life by. Don't make the mistake of passing this book by.

This isnt a very well written book. Quite a number of factual errors throughout, particularly in the section on Paul VI. Yes, it's interesting to read closeup shot after closeup shot, but what are we reading? The general picture that emerges after the intimate detail telling and revealing of secrets is probably more or less true, who can know? We know Cody was a kind of monster, we know about the Vatican Bank thugs, we know Pope Paul's desolate vacillation and its fruit. Archbishop Lefebvre comes in for short shrift given the effect his decisions have had on the Church in succeeding years, and the angle of the authors leaves little doubt how they view the bishop who would not submit. John Pauls I & II are ably treated but like Paul VI are only superficially plumbed. It's a popular book destined for those who want but a glance. The worst of this book is its shallow intent. Digging up facts and getting servants to spill this or that nugget doesnt form an engaging picture of the interior life of any papacy, let alone one as important as Montini's. Paul VI's considerable body of writings is overlooked, the animus between Villot and Benelli is hardly noted, and on and on. 'Pontiff' makes no claim as an historical work, but it claims to divulge history. I wonder. How can we know the intimate life of a pope? Should we? We read the history, that's enough, leave mystery its place. The rest pursues the gross tabloid chimera like a tracking hound, and makes for a fairly dismal book.

I picked this book up on a whim, and found it an interesting mix; a somewhat anti-academic treatise written by a flourishing academic, filled with tremendous flashes of genuine insight into the perennial American ethos as it sifts out in our culture. Written in an engaging style, Kammen is clearly devoted to his own intellectual gifts but not overcome by them. His dissection of the impact of television on modern culture is particularly adept, if only the creators of TV programming possessed this much understanding of the medium in which they work! The pace of the book is invitingly brisk, and while it is thick going in a few places, it's mostly quite readable and makes its arguments in a manner that is concise, cogent, and to-the-point. Despite the somewhat dry title (although the Reginald Marsh painting on the cover really cinched my purchase of the book!), this is a penetrating and important look at the direction of American culture. Kammen's take on multi-culturalism in America seems somewhat bleached, and his occasional ruminations on cultural life played out vis-a-vis the increasingly virulent class war that rumbles just under the surface of American life seem conservative and not always informed, perhaps closeted a bit by his academic background. One other thing- the illustrations in the book are beautifully chosen, including Rockwell, Benton, and a positively magical drawing of Warhol by Jamie Wyeth. I'd never seen it before and it alone is worth the price of the book!

I agree with everything said so well in the previous review. Unfortunately for those of us who long for insight and instead are given a travel diary - often in verbatim transposition, I fear - a real thirst after finishing the book is not uncommon. I agree with Mr Bernabo that an editor in hiding cries out at times wishing to rescue us from another plane trip and another successful performance, but I must say that Caballe's biography (seemingly often lauded) suffers hardly a less dismal fate than does Prima Donna's Progress in that regard, and it claims not one but two biographers and who knows how many editors along the way. Perhaps Sutherland truly has no inclination to write about her art. However unwished for, such a thing is not utterly outside the somehow conceivable. It was once remarked that Sutherland would have preferred puttering in her garden to singing on the operatic stage for most of her life, and there is indeed a certain 'happy' aura around her art that could indicate perhaps such might be the case.It doesnt matter. This book gets four stars because it is Sutherland in her own words, for richer or poorer. The title is wickedly original, the cover photo is perfect, and one is able, at least, to spend a few hours with an artist whose impeccable contribution will stand and conquer for all time. Let that be enough.

One of only a handful of perfect movies. Geraldine Page is beguiling and mesmerizing from beginning to end. Her's was genius of the life-changing kind. She was an impeccable film artist, a master actor to awaken us, and make us better. Of all her great films, I think this one the finest. First rate cast - Rebecca DeMornay is moving as hell, and John Heard extra fine as Carrie Watts' son Ludie. Horton Foote crafted a perfect screenplay, intelligent and brave, itself a kind of paean to Page; it holds her sounds, and insights, already in place. Foote deals auspiciously in ribbons of moments actors are blessed to find once in a career. Geraldine Page deserved no less, and she, of course, rose to the occasion. The result is a caution to our complacency, a farewell performance so unaware of itself, and as beautiful as anything you'll ever see on film. Page's repeated traversal of the Baptist hymn 'There is a fountain filled with blood' is one of Bountiful's brilliant grace notes, as her perfect incarnation of Carrie Watts flourishes. Don't miss treasuring this gem. It is American filmmaking at its rarely glimpsed best.

This is a smashing CD! SO fine! Sandra Bernhardt says DeLaria is &quot;the best singer in the world&quot;, and by the end of this disc, one is rendered incapable of resisting such a laden declaration! Opening with a straight ahead version of &quot;The Ballad of Sweeney Todd&quot;, DeLaria immediately opens up her box of MUSICAL gifts. Everything is within her high View, Everything's been seen to, Everything is New and Right, and on top of that, she turns Larry Goldings loose on piano! Potent stuff! DeLaria follows with a post-hip &quot;Cool,&quot; and a galvanizingly other-worldly &quot;With Every Breath I Take&quot;. Listen: Lea Delaria's got Intelligence -the Bright and Mystic kind!- and MUSICIANSHIP as deep and riveting as it comes. The Voice? Glory in spades, people! It's the real thing! In the end, though, it's the purest musicianship of this woman, and of the artists she has with her here, that makes this disc so Inevitable, and unforgettable. That, and the incredible entry she makes after the instrumental break on &quot;Welcome To My Party&quot; - !!! Who knows what makes a singer great, or why and how such extraordinary gifts come along, redeeming us? This disc goes a long classic cool way in offering evidence as to why Lea DeLaria is 'happening' right now! Fly, Lea, fly baby!! This is just the best music.

You dont have to be a bluegrass fan to love this film, but you might end up one! Bill Monroe's life and music beautifully dominate a penetrating look at bluegrass music and the land that birthed it. Monroe's musicianship is astounding; his voice is like a lonesome wail, a tantalizing, gripping mix of pain and joy. He's an artist of immense stature, and High Lonesome does his legacy justice. This is a rowdy portrait of Appalachia and the hard South, salted with anecdotal contributions from people who live there, their music and stories of the artists who've succeeded in making a very persuasive art known and loved beyond a regional world. I gathered a bundle of heart from this film, and learned to love Monroe's music even more. One of the best moments is watching the grin wrap around Jimmy Dickens' face as he sings '20/20 vision, walkin' around blind...'. The film's chock full of nugget after nugget of pure music, resilient humanity, and an authentic film vision, all of it enriching to the max! High Lonesome delves into the importance of radio in its early days, and finishes with a blazing look at bluegrass festivals (lots of full performances are included!) and a number of current bluegrass performers, the unbeatable Allison Krauss among them. It's a film to watch again and again, one that stays true to its heart, and pulls you in for a memorable, at times haunting experience! Recommended enthusiastically - you wont be disappointed. And the music is stick-with-you SPECTACULAR!

Being an 'Actus tragicus' man deep to my bones, I covetously own ten professional versions (and three college recordings), and along comes this reading by Bach Collegium Japan ensemble under Masaaki Suzuki and blows my entire cache AND me off the map! It's no hyperbole to say: THIS is the truth of Bach. Rarely has any recording humbled me so completely as this amazing ensemble's rendering of Bach's little funeral cantata of humble mein. I listened last night - for three hours - to this astonishing recording, lost for words, but went to bed a grateful man. The soul-cleansing accomplished by this ensemble of musicians is overwhelming; fidelity to composer and score bathed in musicianship so pure every iota of Bach's genius, subsumed in profound spirituality, becomes the gritty, everlasting peace of life and death. No other reading I've encountered has comparably revealed Bach the man of God in language so plain, and profound. From musicianship of this depth arises spiritual experience. Using the old-fashioned instrumental framework - two recorders, two viola da gamba and continuo - the opening Sonatina instantly cedes to the spiritual everything that will come. The singing of countertenor Yoshikazu Mera is so beautiful you have to grow a new heart to hold it. This young master (b. 1971) delivers 'In deine Hande' like a witness of the ages - burning with simplicity. Soprano Midori Suzuki sings section II's concluding cry for deliverance - 'Komm, Herr Jesu' - with unearthly sympathy. All the soloists entwine perfectly with one another and with Bach. Cantata 71 (God is My King) is superbly realised, the trumpets brilliantly recorded and the singing unified beyond belief. Finally, the acoustic of the Shoin Women's University Chapel recording location is a revelation. This remarkable recording surely points the way for every musician looking to find Bach - in the heart of musicianship able to speak the spiritual. I immediately ordered three more Cantata recordings by Bach Collegium Japan. Acquire this Bach with joy.

Dutch musician/musicologist Ton Koopman leads performances of six Bach cantatas in a mostly successful filmed musical venture. The performances by the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and Choir adhere to accepted standards of 'Baroque performance' while manifesting Bach's red-blooded music with passionate abandon. Especially welcomed is the inclusion of BWV 106 'Actus Tragicus', Bach's funeral cantata of humble mien and ecstatic everlasting richness, with a superbly played opening sonatina, the singers entering the stage only toward its conclusion. My one disappointment was the really unnecessary commentary throughout by Koopman. I'm a musician and teacher who appreciates Koopman's musical attainment, but his ability to communicate Bach's essence with words is fraught with the nomenclature of musicians that translates confusedly at best to the average viewer, a criticism frequently made to me by my students who have watched the film. I reckon one man's 'informative soliloquy' is another's made-to-order bore. I don't find the spiritual attainment in these performances that one finds in the Cantata performances of Bach Collegium Japan, but the rewards here are plentiful regardless. Recommended for lovers of Bach's cantatas. This dvd is definitely a worthwhile plus to the available catalogue.

Jan Wong, Chinese-Canadian journalist, has written a sterling book full of compassion, hard choices, and a great deal of soul-searching. Wong's romance with Mao's virgin communism leads her from an already exceptional life in Canada to China, to Beijing University, through the anguish of the Great Cultural Revolution, and safely out the other side. Much more enjoyable a read than &quot;Born Red&quot;, yet not as pungent as Anchee Min's &quot;Red Azalea&quot;, &quot;Red China Blues&quot; (great title!) definitely stands out among the dozens of books of reminiscences by those who survived Mao's disastrous final years. It's indeed interesting in reading these various accounts of life in Mao's China, especially through the Cultural Revolution, that we are being given so many irreplaceable glances into that woeful time, each new book providing some important new angle of understanding. Wong is clearly a first-rate journalist, the prose is succinct, heartfelt, and balanced. Lots of informative and thoughtful snapshots are included as well- Wong, her friends, some of the people who figure prominently during her sojourn in her ancestral land. A beautifully finished chronicle of a hair-raising adventure by a woman of tremendous courage, humor, and talent. I enjoyed every bit of it!

This is music making utterly without pretension. Hough's cosmic simplicity lets him present with jewelsmith precision a delectable art, something consistently true with this artist. It's always rewarding, and Spanish Album is heaped with it. Moreover, his connoisseur taste runs naturally to musical jewels - pieces neglected or not thought of, and possessing a striking and shimmering newness. The Soler sonata is elegant, spirited, the Mompou sleek and heartbreaking. There's a real wealth of fine music in this collection. Niemann's silken 'Evening in Seville' astonishes anew with each hearing. The fortuitous aspects of Stephen Hough's musical art are the cleanheartedness of his playing, which is to say his spirit, and an uncorrupted intelligence to warm it - rivals together indeed for preeminence in this superb CD. I never tire listening to it, it always welcomes me to refresh. Hough engages the mysteries of music with dire success and rampant beauty. Lucky we are!

Cheery remastering and faultless oboe playing by de Lancie contribute mightily to this disc. The Strauss is understated and succeeds because of it. If you're not familiar with it, get this recording for Francaix' 'L'Horloge de Flore' (The Flower Clock) -- a little miracle of 20th cent. music, a score so French and so free. It has a sweet and brilliant taste -- music 'sans souci!' De Lancie's is arguably the best recorded version, and Previn's a perfect friend in this music. You'll wonder how it is you never heard this contagious little oboe concerto -- a concerto in chamber music form! It's a perfect jewel of a piece, and followed by a compelling restrained 'Gymnopodie', little's left but bliss. De Lancie's playing is free and unaffected, he pushes up against the orchestra and brings it along, Previn dances, the whole marvelous edifice aloft passes by carefree and wonderful. 'L'Horloge de Flore' is pure musical delight to treasure. Ideas about the restoration of earlier recordings as a medium of modern expression are vindicated by art of this kind. Couldn't be more satisfying.

If you know Joseph Campbell's work, this documentary provides little new info but plenty of big insight into his teaching and personal life, with especially generous sketches of his dancer wife, and her spiritual and artistic journey parallel to Campbell's own, including some fascinating footage of her work with Martha Graham's company. The mere hour long film flies by, a tribute to its integrity. One sterling aspect is the copious footage of Campbell talking/teaching with friends and students, &a palette of wonderful interview narratives edited with pizazz, and with clear affection for Campbell's vast essential contribution to religious studies. The master is his genial, intense, unflappable best throughout, trademark ruddy cheeks in full bloom. If you seek an indepth experience of Joseph Campbell's work, get Moyers' 'Power of Myth'. This bio documentary is a swell companion piece to that series. Big satisfied recommendation.

I remember Van Cliburn's Moscow triumph in 1958, and this modest and thoughtful documentary tribute to Cliburn strikes a harmonious note. The performance footage is super. Typical period Russian black and white film and some odd angles, but the playing is unforgettable, at times even moving. There are two long performance clips, not the whole pieces, but very generous cuts of Liszt's Mephisto Waltz and Chopin's Scherzo #3. There's a good deal of performance footage included. I had forgotten Cliburn's touch, and found myself reminded of Stephen Hough - a vivid roundness and intelligence, and playing that, if not profound, exhudes a surfeit of noble restraint that eluded many other pianists of Cliburn's generation. It's odd that the film never mentions the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, celebrated as it is. Get this film to hear again Cliburn playing live, it's something special. Sound is superb, the footage mix is excellent throughout: interviews with musicians and friends (a nice bit from Leontyne Price who was at Julliard with Cliburn), performances, family interviews and footage. A quiet film, much like its legendary subject.

I agree with so many of the reviewers previous who praised this book. It's a monumental piece of writing, besides being a fervent indictment of the colonialist mind. The indictment is made without reserve, its scaffolding always present, and there's genuine intellect around the pages. I remain astonished at the efficiency of the prose; Hochschild leads a heady charge to the middle of what these things mean, his own humanity in full array. It really is masterful. I would only add-- make no mistake, the key to this book lies in the way Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is brought to heel, by subtle and instructive means, especially in the chapter 'Meet Mr. Kurtz.' It is from THAT place of intense truth, as from a hot central core, that this book spins out its dreadful tale. Page after page, one is stung anew at learning the exactly dissected layers of these creatures-- Leopold, Stanley, these monsters feeding from a decadent culture, one already in decline, though none but soothsayer knew it then. The prose is as clean and free as the story it reveals is filthy and made of oppression; I think that clash has a great deal to do with how affording an experience reading this book is. It's a book of sorrow, nothing really has prepared one for it; but Hochschild works a kind of love over this book, and the rewards are immense. Recommendation, no reservation.

Among a number of well researched and well composed books on the subject of the origins of the historical Jesus, Kersten's book remains one of the finest. Cogently written without superfluous speculation, 'Jesus Lived in India' presents irrefutable evidence of Jesus' sojourn into India; his living, learning (becoming in fact a Buddhist adept), and eventually dying there. Having chanced upon the evidence in Ladakh, Kersten patiently pieces together a mountain of evidence the profundity of which is only enhanced by his matter-of-fact style of presentation. A comprehensive article by article, step by step look at the astonishing convergence of the teachings and life paths of Jesus and Buddha is one of the clearest and most convincing threads of Kersten's scholarship. The ancient links between the Israelites and the East is intimately explored, and heartening conclusions are drawn. Nearly every aspect of modern theological enquiry concerning Jesus with respect to the inadequate record provided by canonical scripture is examined lovingly and fearlessly; the years of Kersten's investigation are brought to thorough and enlightening fruition in the pages of this remarkable book. It is clear that the political preoccupation of the Paulinist religion that has called itself Christianity for two thousand years has prevented, and continues to prevent, the dissemination and study of the true facts of Jesus' history; offering instead a lifeless, and often decadent, sectarian proposition of a Christ-martyr, the exclusive and moribund archtype of which has filled the Common Era with bloodshed and dissension, and propelled the world into a post-Christian era by its demonstrable manipulation of history. Highly recommended reading for the discerning seeker.

Merton quotes D.T. Suzuki: &quot;Zen always aims at grasping the central fact of life, which can never be brought to the dissecting table of the intellect&quot;; and &quot;Zen must be seized with bare hands, with no gloves on.&quot; No wonder Merton's reverence for Zen, for these are his own ideas of Christian monasticism. With his illuminating mind in full stride, and his interventions keen as crystal, if he went no deeper than to make an apparent synthesis, it would be enough. But Merton strives for farther fields, finds and feeds them, and not surprisingly leaves them flourishing. He leaps wholly into a personal embodiment of Zen and its spiritual complexities, and ends restoring his own monastic experience. The essay 'Zen in Japanese Art' pays loving homage to the classic spirit of Daisetz Suzuki's seminal 'Zen and Japanese Culture', but lives and breathes on its own. In its simple three and a half pages, Merton weaves the aesthetic ideas of Zen philosopher Kitaro Nishida, makes the case that Zen and Zen art are the exact opposite of Sartre's 'pessimistic nihilism,' and in a single amazing paragraph toward the end, beautifully finds in the formal &quot;tea ceremony&quot; a respect and harmony consistent with the simplicity of twelfth-century Cistercian architecture at Fontenay or Le Thoronet. But no idle intellectual excursions invade here; again and again Merton draws everything back to the Christ sought in the apophatic tradition with a faithfulness that exhudes an almost excruciating surfeit of spiritual understanding. Finding St Gregory's &quot;No one gets so much of God as the man who is thoroughly dead&quot; 'lying next' to Bunan Zenji's &quot;While alive, be dead, thoroughly dead-- All is good then, whatever you may do&quot;, Merton turns a light on centuries of Christian ascetic experience with one true, bold stroke. Birds of Appetite is strewn with page after page not of ideas only, but wisdom. He responds to D.T. Suzuki's exquisite essay 'Innocence and Knowledge' (included in the book) with 'The Recovery of Paradise', arguing that the Desert Fathers sought the emptiness and innocence of Adam and Eve in Eden, invoking along the way John of the Cross, and making one of Dostoevsky's &quot;saints,&quot; the Staretz Zosima, serve as antagonist throughout the essay. Merton notes &quot;there is a dimension where the bottom drops out of the world of factuality and of the ordinary,&quot; an observation no doubt honed in the solitude of the hermitage, up the mountain above Gethsemane Abbey. He adds, &quot;it might be good to open our eyes and see.&quot; I'm recommending a huge little book, meticulously published by New Directions with its customary attentiveness to shadow and light, inside and out. See for yourself.

The epic documentary film &quot;Richter, the Enigma&quot; was his crowning moment as a visionary, and this book is a bewitching companion-- a beautiful summation of Bruno Monsaingeon's life's paean to Art. 'Notebooks and Conversations' is a powerhouse! great in its subject, its inventiveness, and achieving a seamless framing of one of life's peerless musicians. Richter reveals himself and his art subtly - without fanfare, contrariness, with no bother at all-- it's an astonishing act made the more affecting by its silent invoking of a kind of perfect resignation with no bitterness. The opening pages are beautiful...Richter speaks of how the opera taught him everything about music, about the piano-- for musicians especially, reading his thoughts are a trove of consolation. The last half of the book with its neat arrangement of Richter's journal 'topic/notes and observations' on each page is as fulfilling as a second book! Richter makes observations about recordings, concerts, artists and composers, with joy, insight and reserve mingled in equal parts, and equal footing is afforded both the kind and the provocatively distant Richter; here Monsaingeon's unerring artistic sense provides editing as wise as it is subtle. Monsaingeon's love for this project is palpable throughout, as with the film, and he talks a bit in the Introduction about that love. His legacy as a documentarian is enhanced, if possible, even more with this invaluable book. Photos are frequent, sometimes almost unexpected -- and Richter, his face and bearing often resembling Jean Genet's, seems free and sad, resigned, responsible for a life of immense gifts, immense burdens, yet strangely indifferent to it all. At the end of the Introduction, Monsaingeon tells of finally deciding to edit out of his Richter film an 'ending' where he beautifully manages to 'thank' Richter, believing, as he says, that, after all, &quot;it goes without saying.&quot; If you have any interest at all in books of this kind, your pleasure over this book will be rich and glad indeed, it goes without saying. Don't hesitate!

Lefebvre's 'Open Letter To Confused Catholics' is perhaps his most passionate tract, his most emphatic refusal. It's impossible to overturn the facts that Monseigneur Lefebvre lays bare. The Archbishop's diagnostic skills are nearly without peer in the modern Church. His historic bishop-making antidote is of course what got him into mortal trouble with Rome, although neither many of his public followers went swayed even by the excommunication, nor has his Society become troubled and shriveled. On the contrary, the Roman authorities continually come calling, even now, searching for a reconciliation. They come because their belly has grown hollow; that fact alone is a living echo of every word in this book. Apart from the incontestable expression of Catholic doctrine it encases, 'Open Letter' is refreshing again and again as Lefebvre's integrist beliefs clearly rebuke the often mindless motoric piety of American traditionalism, with its insipid Americanism ever odious and long ago condemned by Rome. Lefebvre's passionate defence is born of a European culture that by definition despised democracy, and it is what lends his effort here a particular, ravishing ecstasy, problematic as that may be in the post-Christian age. In the end, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre seems hardly to notice. It is there, in the heart of this man's ineluctable devotion, lies the virtue and vitality of this book. It's a challenging manifesto from a remarkable churchman.

The best thing about this recording is the composite selection of this music on a single disc. The Corydon Singers, and particularly Thomas Allen (he of legendary career!) are quite fine, though quirkily I prefer John Shirley-Quirk's version of 'Five Mystical Songs' with Kings College Choir, especially his 'Love Bade Me Welcome' with its magnificent rendering of the last words "and I did sit and eat", which once heard will never forsake your memory. The spare yet intensely textured sound of the Corydon Singers is best suited to the diaphanous 'Serenade to Music'. Vaughan Williams' ability to set a text like no one else is a perfect partner to Shakespeare's arching mastery of the English language! It's a superb piece basically ignored in this country, as are most of VW's symphonies except for the ubiquitous No. 2. When have you heard an American orchestra perform the inventive Eighth or the redemptive Fifth? I agree that Boult's recordings of VW's music are a fine standard, &his 'Serenade' is especially fine, but this recording flourishes. Matthew Best gives space and reason to the beautiful ambience of the score. Flos Campi is well done here with Nobuko Imai's viola playing free of affectation as always, displaying an unpretentious mastery of the score. The 'Fantasia' (one of VW's favorite musical motives, even when not properly so called!) demonstrates Vaughan Williams' true veneration of the English hymn tune, a fetching gift that annointed all of us throughout his composing career, and perhaps more than anything secured for him a place in the pantheon of great composers. This is a successful disc of masterworks of an often misunderstood and certainly under-performed composer. The English Chamber Orchestra enjoys one subtle triumph after another in this recording - the strings are beautifully recorded, as is the singing. If it had been designed as a 2-disc effort and included 'Benedictus', the 'Mass in G', 'Sancta Civitas', and 'The Lark Ascending', we'd have close to a set of VW's essential choral and smaller orchestral works in one package!

Iota Unum is a very great work, a work of genius by a preeminent scholar of the xxth century, everyone knows this. One is compelled to more than one reading of it, I think. To call it comprehensive is insufficient. It is, in sum, right. Right in its foundation and its diagnoses. Right in its hope for repair through authentic renewal. When the great Swiss thinker wrote Iota Unum, reaction within the Vatican was one of niggardly appreciation for Amerio's inevitable contribution, and his genius treated with unattractive indifference. Iota Unum's tidings stung those men whose eminent programme was laid bare irrefutably except by a kind of conjured fantasy, a programme irrevocably called out so as never to be allowed again its lying falsity. An argument could be made that this single critical book germinated renewing seeds of reason and fidelity in the Church, as fidelity is ever falsity's enemy. L'Osservatore Romano, hotbed of Vatican political skullduggery, at the time and for many years dismissed Amerio's work as "anticonciliar reaction," refusing to discuss the book or its arguments in any way, creating division where none had been before. In like manner has the lamentable legacy of Vatican Council II been the division of Catholic unity. Ah, but pride and time! Today, I experienced tremendous satisfaction to read that L'Osservatore Romano has contritely and publicly rehabilitated Romano Amerio, in connection with a recent Roman symposium on his thought and work, praising his "primacy of truth over love." A sign like this of such deep change in the heart of Rome with respect to the tragedy of the last 40 years is immensely important. Imagine the things that might come! Read this book. The vision is new and fresh, and the remedy good news.

Not much new can be said in praise of this superb film. I'm always struck by the beauty of Jeff Gibbs' score. The successful use of other music, including Jarvo's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' and most of the pop elements, is indebted to the deeply felt original score Gibbs has created. Synth effects, maybe, but the pieces are beautifully conceived, if not entirely without precedent. The brutal effect of the film depends so tenderly on the musical score, one is reminded of Britten's high valuation of the usefulness of music. Moore's vision is commendable, and beholden in turn to the musical tableaux of Jeff Gibbs. The soundtrack CD is fine, but needs the film as much as the film cries out for Gibbs' music. Highest recommendation for both film and musical score, both Moore and his composer. [2007 update: It's unfortunate, isnt it, how the conservative/fascist think tanks that blight the American social-political landscape actually hire people to scour [...], among other sites, in order to vote 'negative' on reviews that repudiate their vicious political agenda? This is a well documented fact. The 'votes' against this review are one example - negative 'votes' for what is really a non-political review of a film, a review focused almost entirely on the film's musical score! One can find this tactic throughout the amazon site. No matter. This is a great film that exposes Bush for the fraud he is, something the American public finally realized in 2006. Still, these cheap and honorless tactics are like food and drink to these people. What a comment on American life in our time. I gladly wear 22 'negative' votes like a badge of honor. ~J. Anderson]

The Center for Constitutional Rights, a non-profit organization (founded in 1966 by civil rights attorneys working in the South) dedicated to protecting the citizen rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, has produced a vital, easy-to-read compendium of the dereliction of George W Bush, including a trenchant four-page introduction by William Goodman, legal director of CCR. By the formulating of four articles of impeachment, Bush's crimes come quickly into full relief, even to the basest kind of awareness of the daily events we are living through, providing along the way a surprisingly broad picture of the degredation of a nation brought low by an ignorant, bullying president, complicit corporate media, and the pathetic, even terrifying, witlessness of a society near-mystically obsessed by acquisition and consumption. Other reviews here have adequately detailed the impeachment articles. Nearly fifty pages of appendices include excerpts from the Constitution on impeachment, a useful history of impeachment, the Articles of Impeachment against Andrew Johnson, Nixon and Clinton, and pertinent notes on procedure. Finally, the book offers an extremely useful one-page webliography with links to information germane to a deeper understanding of the book's thesis. Recommended to every fellow citizen. Stop consuming! Wake up! Start reading, start thinking! Take action! WE are the nation, a power greater than any thug president, and certainly a people capable of repudiating the gross bandit who seeks day by day to diminish our birthright. The time is NOW! Also recommended is Elizabeth Holtzman's excellent 'The Impeachment of George W Bush: A Practical Guide for Concerned Citizens'.

One of BBC's finest miniseries. Hayley Mills is perfect and subtle and full of surprises as Elspeth's mother. Hawkesworth's adaptation cuts sumptuously to the bone, understated and pulsing with life. Shot entirely in Kenya, director Roy Ward Baker favors colors gorgeous and contagious, and courageous in the indoor scenes, with thoughtful closeup angles underscoring the accumulating tensions that orchestrate the heart of the story. It ends up a relentless examination of British Colonialism, but without rancor. Bitterness is hidden most of the film, peeking out at a few crucial moments, but in the end the indictment stands. For all its natural beauty, Flame Trees is a film of a big sadness, and is more lovable for it. Holly Aird is a revelation as Elspeth, sometimes seeming to channel the woman Elspeth Huxley became, curious and invincible. Elspeth's trusting friendship with Njombo, an African plantation worker, is a small sweet light coursing through the film, and her exploration of African wildlife is moving. If you missed Flame Trees of Thika, get this DVD, then by all means read Elspeth Huxley - the two fit hand in glove. Warm recommendation.

Keith Michell's Henry VIII bests all others hands down. Step by defiant step, he creates a Henry unsaved by his rich sadness. It's got to be the performance of a lifetime! Six episodes, six writers, a mini-play for each wife, the result is a towering theatrical experience. Almost imperceptibly, Catherine of Aragon's shadow drifts across the film, an unadorned presence, indicating the pungent intelligence behind the whole enterprise. English theatre alone makes magic like this - brilliant and intimate and addicting. This one ranks on a par with the BBC's Elizabeth R. They are brother and sister films in tone and mood. Keith Michell is just ferocious throughout, You can't imagine the pleasure. Don't miss it.

A beautiful little book about Frost's apparently well documented journey to Russia in the early 60s (I only vaguely recall it), his important visits with Yevtushenko (who proves himself to be as usual preoccupied with Yevtushenko - brilliant and notoriously sidetracked) and the great Anna Akhmatova (the dangerously vital witness to the worst of Soviet abuse of its artists), and finally his over-arching visit with Krushchev. The book is compact and to the point, much like Frost's poems. A bit of Frost's personal hesitancy comes through, though we find it but precedes his customary plain-spoken triumph in Russia, as in America, once he begins to feel comfortable - a requisite luxury that remained important to Frost throughout his life. Strongly written by someone who was there, it's a gem of a book for anyone interested in Robert Frost's conception of America and her artists, revealing a robustly innocent kind of faith one unfortunately finds nowhere nowadays.

This is an interesting book, enough that I wish it were a great one. Generous delving into Hadewijch of Antwerp, her mysticism and its rights, right to the essence of Hadewigian spirituality-- there are some fine passages illumined with Bouyer's considerable gifts, and a superb translation (by Mother Columba Hart) of a Hadewijch spring aubade that leaves you pinned to its two pages for a spell! Bouyer's thought is lean and clean, and admirable for that, but pointlessly smug with a really old-fashioned modernism. Some of his remarks on Elizabeth of the Trinity betray this tendency, and in fact nearly indicate that he hasn't understood her mystic gifts one whit, however well-schooled his observations are. This affectation is less noticable in his remarks on Therese Martin, although he reckons Elizabeth Catez's family "more open to the world and generally more cultured" than the Martins. He loves Edith Stein most of all, of course, and he manages some genuinely interesting insights into a rather overexposed spirituality. The lines he draws between Stein and Husserl are interesting enough, but nothing new, I think because he's apparently miles from grasping the living charism of Carmel. While he devotedly mentions Teresa- "such a scatterbrain, the copies of whose spiritual writings betray superficiality and a pretentious vacuum on every page"- Fr. Bouyer might benefit most from reading again not only the 'Life', but 'The Book of Foundations' as well, to receive, hopefully, what he has not yet learned-- interestingly, the very Thing received freely, learned quickly and lived profoundly by Elizabeth of the Trinity. Predictable scholarship, book has no soul, take a pass.

You get the feeling Vengerov doesn't play the Ysaye, he channels it! This is stupefying music making, and the Ysaye Sonatas especially, hardly known, are musically brilliant pieces. Even apart from the Fox-Lefriche transcription, Bach is all over this disc. The secret metaphysic of Bach appears like a fragrance in whatever Vengerov plays; a violinist's musical construct must be endowed with Bach's rhythmic consciousness or it won't endure, and Vengerov loves the Master almost more in Ysaye than in Bach! A rich Bachian rhythmic core in this Russian master's violin playing is the beauty of this recording. It's curiously an effect even more accessible in his live performances, the physical dimensions of his playing are perfectly aligned, &amp;all you get is freedom and joy in the music he makes. Reminiscent of Oistrakh in that way. This is one of Vengerov's best recordings musically, and the sonics are play-it-AGAIN captivating. Get it to hear the Ysaye sonatas, but the rest of the program also rewards. The Shchedrin sonata is shocking and pure, and Vengerov extracts all the juice, delivering a major performance of it. I agree it's interesting how much the live encore doesnt jar or intrude, it's a heady reminder of the art of the stage, and leaves a musical imprint too. While he's got a strapping pop star kind of personal charm, Vengerov is a musician of tremendous intellect and heart, distilling sheer music and refining an extraordinary art, qualities rampant hereabout.. check it for yourself.

This is a beautiful book by one of the progenitors of Zen in the West. The late Roshi Jiyu-Kennett, an Englishwoman who trained unstoppably(!) in Japan under Chisan Zenji, late abbot of Sojiji, indeed the first Western woman to do so, and received her transmission in Japan before coming to America and ultimately founding Shasta Abbey, a still flourishing Soto Zen abbey and training center at the foot of Mt. Shasta, of which she remained Abbess until her recent death. This book is both a manual of doctrine and practice, as well as a foray into historical aspects of Soto Zen. Everything is covered here- liturgy, training, practice, enlightenment, the transformations of Zen necessary to its success in the West, and the book is highly readable. Jiyu-Kennett is a gifted teacher taking us around every corner with ease, and even humor. Divided into three 'books', the third is a fascinating look at the teachings of her own teacher, Keizan Zenji; the chapters on the seventeen Ancestors is wonderful prose in itself, and an enlightening bit of teaching. Highest recommendation! Jiyu-Kennett's Japanese diaries (&quot;The Wild, White Goose&quot; in 2 volumes), written during her training and subsequent early priesthood in Japan, are indispensable books as well. Her immense intellect and unconquerable spirit are vividly apparent, and even more intimately given than in this excellent book.

Begun in 1947 after a return to his native England, Canticles was composed over a twenty-five year period, and what music this is! Some have remarked on the complexity of the score, but to sit and listen to these sublime expressions of supreme love, sung by the incomparable, dare one say intrepid Peter Pears is a once in a lifetime experience. Canticle I uses a 17th century meditation text by Francis Quarles, opening the piece with a beautiful, peaceful flow that enchants from beginning to end. Other text sources include Edith Sitwell and T.S. Eliot, the setting of whose The Death of St Narcissus is one of Britten's finest achievements in his huge output of vocal writing. Pears is nothing short of stupendous throughout, singing with intensity, intimacy, and that virginal vocal texture that belongs to him alone. Probably the greatest miracle of this recording is the piano playing of Britten himself, proving again what a pianist he was - assured, richly musical, and of course deep in his own music. Again and again, he enriches his own towering score with remarkable pianism and an abounding musicality as a player. It's just wonderful in every way. The recording was made in three sessions over a period of fifteen years, from 1961-1976. If you've never heard this irreplaceable composition, this is the time and the recording to check out. The delightful A Birthday Hansel on texts of Robert Burns, completed in 1975 for the seventy-fifth birthday of the Queen Mother, is a perfect ending to an unrivalled listening experience. There are few Britten recordings I treasure more than this one. Recommended with joy!

This is a supreme recording of the All-Night Vigil, no two ways about it. Tenor Karl Dent's singing of the Nyne Otpushchayeshi (Nunc dimittus) is monumental, it takes your breath away. Among so many atributes, Shaw's pacing of this piece leaves nothing wanting; the spaces breathe and contact is multi-dimensional from the first moment until the end. I think the scope and beauty of Shaw's re-creation is unrivalled since the USSR Russian Chorus version on vinyl (never issued on CD). Every musical detail is seen to both by Shaw and his singers; rarely has any great choir sung with such freedom and musicianship, the hallmark of Shaw's legacy surely, and it is munificent and enticing here. There's nothing that's not in service to the music, and utterly unaware of itself - it's the most imposing art imaginable. This is music making of tremendous humility and perfection. a palpable transfixion of Rachmaninov's unearthly score. The basses are radiant, the soloists sing with refined discretion, and there's not a single artistic intention left unrealized. Some will wander to barely brighter sonics, and it's true, but this is an incomparable version of the All-Night Vigil. It's magnificent.

It's true, Jung Chang's fearsome contempt for Mao is a shadow that never leaves this book. I wish she had tempered that, but I suppose she's a right to her demons. She writes as beautifully here as she did in Wild Swans, and it adds a certain delicacy to a bewilderingly pungent story. I'm not sure how 'unknown' the story of Mao is; his is a history of power that parallels other Leaders, even those of the so-called free world. The great helmsmen of the West use violence of another kind, but altogether similarly destructive and unoriginal. No, it's the personal Mao that catches Chang's eye - his sloth, his betrayal of his wives, the perpetual recrudescence of his devouring sexual appetite, his habits of hygiene, or lack of them. Near fetishistic appears her willingness to jump from dirty black teeth to dirty black heart, but I exaggerate. Jung Chang exaggerates, and she shouldn't, but she's written a heck of a book. True, a part of her 'research' flows through her veins, and while a personal stake in the book's resolving theses is convenient, it taints but cannot obliterate some surprisingly convincing scholarship. To suggest less is an unfair bias. Chang's Mao is no prism. Her Mao is evil, which is to say, astringent. Even his poems are bad. But, for me, there's a wholeness to Chang's survival that recommends the book, and makes it worthwhile. If the book is far less than perfect, even if, in the end, it's but a book necessary to have been written, it's arguable that that's sufficient. Don't get your history here, but let one of history's plainly gifted witnesses brilliantly spin a riveting tale.

Eamon Duffy is hell-bent to demonstrate the meaning and legitimacy of traditional English piety, and succeeds by and large with smart scholarship, winningly original ideas, and fret-free, up-tempo prose. The book wears well a mediaevalist scholar's sympathetic penchant for the full color world of his subject; you have no trouble entering Duffy's exotic world. He knocks down the calumny of 'superstition' by REVEALING it with teaching. The Henrician religious revolution is exactingly covered, but forget your mild English sentiments here; the author means to prove his point and does relentlessly. England's masses did NOT rise up and demand what the King unfortunately demanded! Some of the local evidence unearthed by Duffy is among the most compelling in providing armament for his argument that Roman piety remained the daily staple of the common Englishman even as revolution was imposed by royal will. The last section --The Attack on Traditional Religion-- (including a final segment on Elizabeth I) is the best in the book- arguments are focused in, &amp; the prose is clean and responsive. The book is a huge achievment, even at 650+ pages! A fetching bibliography provides extensive evidence of the openness of Duffy's scholarship, and is fascinating marginalia in its own right. Photo of the vandalised bas relief of the mass Sacrifice on the cover is completely moving. No faint-hearted history allowed.

The fact that the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is unabashed to publish a propaganda tract entitled 'Environment and Art in Catholic Worship' means that this is an important book. As if 'Environment' were a kind of committee-induced sacramental poised like one of Stalin's Five-Year-Plans to nourish the souls of the faithful! Every Catholic with his five senses intact knows but too well the abysmal truth of the facts laid bare in this book. Michael S Rose is a courageous person, and must be commended for writing a clear and compelling argument. His facts are impeccable and his reasoning sound. He makes a praiseworthy, if not always practicable, call to action. It would seem impossible to over-argue that the 'Environment' deformers, the destroyers of churches, merely take their cue from the deformed liturgy in current usage. The thought of the Roman Mass, that is, the Immemorial Mass, being ritualized in the new Basilica in Mexico City (to mention but one egregious example) can almost bring you to a kind of desperate laughter. Let's face it- these people have made buildings to MATCH THEIR LITURGY -ugly as sin!- much in the way mediaeval man made Notre Dame, inspired by the ineffable Roman liturgy. The particular voraciousness of the present merry band of Thieves might pass imply as another indicator of a culture in decline, save for the treachery visited upon millions of Catholics who, while not loving an impossible gothic idea, have only wished not to be threatened by the very walls of the Room where they pray. This book addresses solidly and courageously those very people, and offers some hope. Recommended!

If you read only one book on Buddhism, let it be this one. Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the world's great teachers, and this life of Shakyamuni Buddha is his masterpiece. Every chapter is a perfect gem, every idea put forth bears witness not only to the noblest spiritual tradition, but to the purity of heart of its author. I have read this book many times over; it has never failed to move me, never ceased to nourish within me immense avenues of hope and understanding. I think it is an extraordinary literary accomplishment, however efficacious its spiritual impact. Conversely, it is clear that it derives at least some of its literary merit from the profundity of the ideals which it transmits. It is a clear, often surprising, reverent and humane book, a classic of religious literature in the finest tradition of a universal humanist aesthetic. The breadth of Nhat Hanh's gifts is apparent from the outset; the chapters on young Gautama's princely early life, his marriage, the nascent inward understanding that is his even before taking up the search for life's hidden meaning, are so exquisitely composed that one finds oneself already in possession of the truth to come, already one knows intimately the thirst that takes the Buddha from the life he has known and loved, against the wishes of his father's heart, against his love for and committment toward his own wife and child. This is literature of an everlasting kind. The art of narrative found here really has no equal in all of contemporary religious literature. Beautifully delicate line drawings accompany every chapter like a faint temple bell, the language is as constant and profound as a child's, able to encompass the sophisticated searching of the most ardent doubter and the simple heart of the believer alike. It is a truly great book. Art of this kind is surely what Gutenburg's invention was intended for. A perfect treasure. Read it, and live.

As Mr. Vernier says, the venerable 1906 Hymnal was successful in large part due to Vaughan Williams, and Richard Marlow and Trinity College Choir (in superb form!) here demonstrate how valuable a contribution the composer made to the authentic maintenance of the English hymn tradition. Vaughan Williams' 'Come Down, O Love Divine', and his verily native arrangement of 'For All The Saints' alone validate this recording, and there's so much more to admire. Vaughan Williams' relationship with this tradition of hymnody weaves throughout his long composing career; and indeed his scholarship with respect to English folk melody pervades his work on these hymns as much as does his mastery of contrapuntal four-part writing. The veneration he pays Thomas Tallis in 'I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say' is a perfect example of the genius that informs Vaughan Williams' understanding of the spirit of English hymnody. Trinity College Choir is in unusually excellent form on this recording, and Marlow's understanding of the musical nuances of these hymns is at times almost startling. The entire CD is a treat, from beginning to end. One need only be a believer in the subtle art of Ralph Vaughan Williams to appreciate this remarkable offering of the most English of passions. Forthright recommendation!

I listened to this recording again after some time away from it, and found it remarkably durable. The music itself is a different Liszt, not another side of Liszt, but a Liszt with different eyes. Many's the passage that makes one wish he had written opera - instead of all those transcriptions, although that's an entirely different piece of cake again.. Eva Marton is surprising, both in voice and vocal temperament, it's my experience she always sings well when she's with her Hungarian compatriots; her Hungarian concert video is another example. The State Orchestra is never ravishing (although sometimes their Bartok shakes the seats), but they love Marton and play above themselves here. There are a number of exquisite passages of orchestral playing on this recording. Farkas contributes up to her usual demanding standard, and Gregor, especially, leads the male singers in this recording to unexpected heights. His middle voice is everything right all of the time. But the star here is Arpad Joo! I think his conception of this piece is mightier than it deserves, and by that generous assent, he raises it to genuine art. This is real conducting of notable intensity, with excruciating detail attendant to the blueprint of Franz Liszt. Fine as the constituent elements are, I think it's a great recording on Joo's account; one unwise to miss if this kind of magico-sacral explosion is at all to your taste.

What consolations are found in Robert Craft's amazing conversations with Stravinsky. For artists, Stravinsky comes through as a living colossus sitting next to you. The span of his intellect does impress, and with apparently blithe effort on his part, for it never flashes. It only glows. Stravinsky can open his world with a few chosen sentences; entering those tall doors one can only be subsumed in a vast arc of modern art in the person of one man, one great being. Craft's ardent intellect (wonderful queries all, leading the master in) relaxes within his affection for Stravinsky, not only respect but love too. That fusion of intellect and heart marks the book with a perfect pulse. Stravinsky's words come as unfussy and decisive as his music. His remarks on his time in Ustilug before returning to Petersburg offer loads of insight - Firebird was to come shortly - and throughout the book he leads Craft patiently with, typically, a largesse of economy. I'm struck by the providence of their remarkable relationship, the evocative noble aspects of it - how we've all benefitted! The chemistry that undergirds all the Craft-Stravinsky dialogues indicates Stravinsky knew well the worth of their venture, and saw to it that we might profit. Recommended without reservation.

An absolutely exhilarating read, due in tremendous part to the seriously fine writing of Margaret MacMillan. The Oxford scholar approaches the momentous historical event with no apparent bias, making for a significantly elevated reading experience, unlike historians who can't wait to insert their approximations. MacmIllan's style is calm, very much to the point, able to discern the important details, and as smooth as glass. The sparkling new details she provides about both Nixon and Mao during Nixon's time in China are remarkable, and are told with a true historian's novelist eye. The story of Chou En-lai's after the fact reference to Nixon as having 'asked' to come to China, like "a prostitute adorned and presenting herself at the front door" is only one example of this author's mesmerizing skill manipulating authentic atmosphere - she sees what's important and directs it delicately. I'd not read MacMillan before, but will definitely seek out her other work. Her clear mastery of English prose produces an hypnotic effect - think how vital THAT is to a book of history, and how rarely we find it. The vitals of that great China visit are here in force, in a magisterial read.

This recording is a constant joy, an impeccable and indispensable masterpiece, due in equal meausre to a magnificent score by Konstantin Shvedov -such enlightened music!- and to the pervading musical genius of Elena Vastvorova, director of Moscow New Choir, formed in 1991, and responsible for some of the best work of the new Russian choral tradition. Rastvorova's unerring conception is a scaffold of radiance ever present, a musical presence that is clear and tender; her singers respond with sound gestures at once spontaneous and kind, revealing the score with unearthly confidence. Shvedov's Liturgy of Chrysostom is palpable in its divine caste, the drama arises naturally from the music itself-the timbres and colors of Rastvorova's musical ear, I suspect. This is such magnificent music making, it's difficult to adequately declare its importance. The opening dialogue between priest and choir is stunning; clusters of the extraordinary colors of liturgical Slavonic stand and sweeten the air, the music already playing deep in the mystical fields-it's an extraordinary effect! The Benedictus, the Credo, the Hymn to the Virgin, and the short, leaping hosannas in the 'Mercy of Peace' (which corresponds to the Roman Sanctus) give unexpected delight around every corner. Shvedov's harmonic intricacies are subtle, remarkable and constant, and live deep within from the first hearing. The five selected Chants that complete the disc pack a powerful punch of their own, beginning with 'We have no helps and hopes', a Marian hymn given to the baritones. It's music venerable and new; Russian melody carrying its organic life into an edifice of new sound, a migration served beautifully by the gifted Elena Rastvorova and the Moscow New Choir. I commend them for their achievment, and thank them for a magnificent recording to treasure.

Three unalterably supreme elements contribute to the abiding love I hold for this, my favorite recorded Traviata: the singing of Montserrat Caballe and Carlo Bergonzi, and these two artists' faithfulness to Verdi's score. There is little I can add to the perfect comments below of Bartolome Mesa Gil "TOLO". With a few knowing words, he hits upon the essence of a genuine singing art - fidelity to the composer's indicated markings, and the gifts of humility that lead a singer to trust the music, finding through that faithfulness alone all the drama required to bring an operatic score to eternal life. Caballe is the finest purveyor of these irreplaceable qualities of muscianship I've ever encountered in a singer. This recording holds those elements supremely to the fore, qualities that make it the most fulfilling Traviata I've heard in forty years of listening. Search far and wide; a singer who trusts the score is a singer who will inevitably divulge its riches with everlasting conviction. Caballe and Bergonzi meet that test with a devoted embrace, and raise the operatic art by the gift of their musical faithfulness. A recording to treasure.

Despite a magnificent score by Shostakovich, and the completely astonishing performance of Galina Vishnevskaya -a neglected and under appreciated artist in the West- I find a number of problems with this film production. There likely exists no more beautiful opening to an opera than Shostakovich gives us in Lady Macbeth, and Petr Weigl manifests considerable aesthetic comprehension in the opening scene. A kind of inorganic approach sees things fall apart after that. The set designs are adequate, with subdued colors and textures throughout, but the ending fails excruciatingly, as other reviews have noted, and the overall effect suffers from one-dimensional acting. Vishnevskaya's singing is titanic from beginning to end, and hubby Rostropovich conducts like an ecstatic high priest of music. The major disappointment is Hrubesova as Katerina. She conveys little depth in her face and body, no fire, a blankness of temperament that fails to match the richness either of the score or of Vishnevskaya's mighty singing. Gedda's singing is transcendental, and the actor Dlouhy does better than Hrubesova, yet something's missing. For me, that something is always missing in filmed operas. It seems opera needs the artifice of the stage in order to succeed fully, no matter the opera. Efforts at filming Puccini's operas have consistently fallen short of what can be found in an opera house. The medium of film seems to offer a viable alternative to the theatrical experience of opera, but the two media have never seemed to coalesce in any meaningful way. There's no main menu at the beginning of this film. I've watched scores of operas on DVD and always found a subtitles option listed there. Luckily, a reader advised me to check the subtitle option on my DVD remote, rescuing me from a desperate ignorance of technology and an initial rant in this review about no subtitles. That being rectified, I doubt there will come along a recording of this score as fine as that made by these musicians, and suggest that anyone interested in Lady Macbeth go there, not to this film, for their sustenance. Weigl borders on soft [...], in itself not necessarily a violation of the original even with the cuts that are made, but the weakness of the actors' involvement diminished my enjoyment. I appreciated Weigl's Turn of the Screw, but find this film ineffective. Get the recording - it provides all you need to love this music forever. With EMI's beautiful recording, you'll find tremendous musicianship and an inextinguishable score enshrining one of the most enduring repudiations of totalitarianism you're likely ever to encounter.

A comprehensive pursuit of pre-Revolutionary Russian history, well crafted and beautifully written. In my view, this is one of two distinctly outstanding single-volume histories of early Russia available. The other is Orlando Figes' "Natasha's Dance". The first six chapters proceed up to the first Romanovs, granting Ivan the Terrible a captivating revealing that is clearly informed by good scholarship. Chapter 10, "Catherine: A Mind Infinitely More Masculine", delivers a riveting, provocative look at Catherine and her Russia, with probably the finest chapter in the book. The VERY best thing about Land of the Firebird is the profusion of illustrations, all meticulously chosen. Photographs are plentiful (including an amazing snow-covered Church of the Transfiguration of the Saviour), but three ample sections of color plates pour out a stunning array of Russian paintings, which, if not unrivaled by other comparable single-volume efforts, is remarkable for an exquisite discretion. Land of the Firebird is a knowing work with respect to Russian art history. Here are Ryabushkin's "Russian Women of the Seventeenth Century in Church", Repin's "Ivan the Terrible at the Death of His Son", Serov ("Peter II and Princess Elizabeth Riding to Hounds"), Levitsky, Argunov, Kiprensky, Shibanov's "Celebration of a Marriage Agreement" (beautifully reproduced), Briullov, Venestianov, Chernetsov, and Sadovnikov (the darkly beautiful "View of the Winter Palace at Night"). Indeed, there are multiple paintings by Repin, F. de Haenen (five paintings c.1912, including the exuberant "Ice Slide"), Serov, Larionov, Malevich and Kustodiev (1916), including his bewitching "Moscow Tavern". The final plate is Serov's heartbreaking "Nicholas II". I mention these artists' names (and more are included) for those familiar with art history, to say to them this is a very worthwhile book. But the magic of pre-Revolutionary Russian art is unreservedly here for us all in a masterfully drawn Russian history primer. Useful bibliography in appendix. Absolutely recommended.

A marvelous book from beginning to end. The utter unpretentiousness of Maura O'Halloran's rich spiritual journuey is a miracle to encounter. It's so difficult, at book's end, to take leave of this shining young person, this quiet buddha , but she strengthens us for the inevitable by teaching so pure, so real, so necessary, that the natural world of our own lives is changed forever, charged with her abiding and beholden to her example. Others here have stated well the 'content' one finds in these pages; I wish only to say thank you to Maura's wise and devoted family for making the effort to provide us with these journals and family letters. Her mother's Introduction, with its simple and moving veneration of her daughter's life, sets a loving compass for the journey ahead; her sister Elizabeth's drawings are clearly pulled from her own heart, and her brother's afterword together give us an infinitely deep understanding of the means behind the meaning of this extraordinary young woman's life's journey. This is a book of great hope, abundant humor, and sure grace for anyone who reads it. Abundant recommendation without reserve; read it and walk anew the paths of love.

Since discovering Messiaen's ecstatic piano masterpiece in college, it has remained for me one of the staples of my listening life. The specifics of my appreciation for this piece have grown more copious with repeated listenings to this remarkable Teldec version brilliantly conveyed by Pierre Aimard. He gives a more than convincing appraisal of this music as profound as a diamond, and requiring a cohesive exposition by a master jeweller. Aimard offers nothing less! His pianistic art is unmistakable, and filled with reverence and humor. Overall, I prefer this version certainly to Ruth Laredo's, and even to Peter Serkin's version, although a kind of neurotic love on my part for Serkin's willingness to be little, small, inside this music will never die. Certainly Teldec accomplishes a marvel of sonics, and the playing as well is beautifully achieved- cogent, spacious, and never afraid of those moments of unsheathed ecstasy that Messiaen was fearless to compose. While Messiaen remains perhaps for many an acquired taste, the &quot;Vingt Regards&quot; are as near to perfect as anything his utterly unselfconscious gifts ever wrought. This is a finely endowed rendition of a piano masterpiece composed by one of music's rare priests and imagineers, Messiaen the Irresistible.

Jay Dickson's right on in his review. This film is an overpowering achievment, an instant classic of cinematic art. Hard to imagine we have it at all, except that BBC has saved the world more than once with its vision and right action. What a team of artists making a stupendous theatrical experience - it boggles the mind! Few enough make mention of the marvelous score in Gormenghast; R R Bennett devised music that's lithe and droll, and acutely sensitive. If the film's gorgeous to look at, the performances are even better. The range of dark character colors is daunting. Chef Swelter is terrifying, and his scenes are riveting. The scenes with Fuscia and Steerpike are enchanting, like walking through a painting. Intelligent design is all over the piece - the designers succeed big time in making Gormenghast live, and die. The cast is kissed by the gods, each divine spark perfectly in place. The script is more than worthy of Peake's literature, and the film makes its supreme case with enlightened devotion to the original source. If you missed this on PBS, check it out. Once you've seen it, the world is never the same. This is modern art to crow about.

This is my favorite recording of the great 'Babi Yar'. John Shirley-Quirk sings the score with an unbridled reach of passion and musicality. He and conductor Shallon cast the symphony with a liturgical pallor that gives the mighty thing cohesion and a strange calm. The Dusseldorf Symphony is recorded beautifully. Shallon's musicianship is front and center - he's a superb center of calm. It shines in his work. The reason for this recording is of course Shirley-Quirk's audacious, heartbreaking, utterly musicianly singing of a great score, a great symphony. The Dusseldorf players are elegant in the long singing passages of Im Laden, even witty. Shallon sets them loose to soar with the great baritone in the performance of a lifetime. This is a great recording. (Interestingly, I find the few 'live noises' actually enhance the listening experience.)

This is the finest recording of Britten's A Ceremony of Carols I've ever come across, and there are plenty of versions to choose from. The King's College Choir rendition suffers from overstuffed acoustics, a constant with that choir, and their recording of Ceremony of Carols falls short in the requisite rhythmic clarity and intensity. The Christ Church, Oxford version is plodding, and lacks sparkle. Harry Christopher's The Sixteen come close, with marvelous sonics and ecstatic diction, but fall apart in the exacting 'This Little Babe' round with uneven cohesion, and strange stressed notes that ruin the waterfall effect so felicitously construed by Britten. I've not heard Britten's own conducted version, but he scrupulously insisted on boy trebles, and it's difficult if not impossible to conjure a more perfect rendering than the one given here by Shaw and his Chamber Singers. 'This Little Babe' is incomparable in each and all of its rapid fire contours, which is no mean feat. Mezzo-soprano Nanette Soles deserves special mention for incandescent singing on 'That Younge Child". The luminous pacing of 'There is no rose of such virtue' is notable, and to his credit Shaw employs the ecclesiastical pronunciation of the various Latin passages, unlike The Sixteen (and most other English choir recordings of this piece) who insist on an idiomatic British pronunciation of Latin, which offers nothing but distraction. Some will prefer boy treble singers, an attractive option, but for high musical values and the art they inevitably enshrine, it's impossible to be disappointed with this profoundly wrought version of Ceremony of Carols. Bach's 'Break Forth, O beauteous heavenly light' is just right, and I'd not heard 'Heavenly Light' by Aleksandr Kopylov; both are favorable additions to an excellent recording. Recommended.

This is a great book. A collection of the retreat teachings of Zen master Taisen Deshimaru that hits like a shot of sharp sun! Lovingly edited by Deshimaru's long-time student, Philippe Coupey, page after page reveals the Soto master at the apogee of his deep success. For a practitioner, it's a joy to experience the thunder of Deshimaru's method, his keen intellect, and his profound religiousness. As the retreat progresses, the pages are increasingly penetrated with descriptions of the physical aspects of meditation in the dojo in the mountains of Val d'Isere, in France- the flowing water outside the zendo, the natural sounds of the sangha. It's a beautiful, remarkable book in the line of Shunryu Suzuki's teaching, and what's finer than that?! Deshimaru says: Zazen is dry wood without thinking. The deep wisdom arises. The blue mountain stands alone. Looking like a modern day Bodhidharma (there are some great photos in the book!), the best and deepest sense of Deshimaru the buddha never leaves you from the instant you start reading, indeed even once you've finished. Useful, timeless spiritual reading.

Donny Hathaway covered more ground in a few years than hundreds of lesser artists do in a lifetime of recording and performing. On this live set, he is in full control of Everything- that incomparable voice heavy like honey, the funkiest keyboard work this side of Les McCann, a seriously righteous band, including bassist Willie Weeks, the material -even the audience! &quot;The Ghetto&quot; is the pinnacle of this album recorded at two different nightclubs, one in New York and one in LA - Donny comes fully alive as he transforms the audience into his back-up singers, making church, and leaving us the better for it. This is Donny's finest recorded effort. &quot;Extension of a Man&quot;, while it contains the classic &quot;Someday We'll All Be Free&quot;, finds him somewhat remote, no doubt a result of the increasingly virulent heroin habit that finally contributed to the despair culminating in his suicide; here he is an extraordinary Minister of Funk, and he's live, obviously the best way to experience his art. I saw him perform on three separate occasions, and it was easy to tell that he loved performing live - the performances were unforgettable. Donny Hathaway's huge musical and spiritual influence still runs like a river through music being made today- I hear the echo of his presence in artists as diverse as the brilliant Me'Shell Ndegeocello and the re-vitalised Santana. True funk will never die; this remarkable album will always keep the faith.

This is a first rate look at Montserrat Caballe singing in 1966 at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. The sound is good throughout even with the unavoidable technical limitations intact. Apart from that, it's interesting to listen to this singer at the period just before she fully entered her art. I found myself both wanting the fully opened Caballe and interested to watch her seek it for herself even as she sings. For instance, 'Al dolci guidami' (disappointingly) lacks the later studio versions' knowing, but only as if she merely hadnt yet discovered what is already there. The singing throughout however knows no bounds, as careful as her performance is. The orchestra is fairly shabby in its strictness but not its devotion, which is clear at all times. A black and white film static and conventional, but the cameras are good to those who want a close up look at Caballe singing; some beautiful shots of the sound seeming to visually appear leaving her body. Those interested in that sort of thing will see it immediately and be glad. Whatever else, it's an intriguing look at the musical art of a natural wonder. She's so much more than a singer - Caballe is a musician. THAT distinction is fully formed in this recital dvd.

This documentary of Pavarotti's trip to China is probably interesting if you're an uncritical fan of the man. If you're more a fan of his singing, I recommend the concert-only video of his recital in the Great Hall of the People- what an amazing looking place it is, huge and very modern, but with a gargantuan, unbelievably bourgeois central chandelier! Pavarotti is a less than interesting fellow in many ways, while he is without argument the supreme tenor of the last 100 years, greater than Caruso. There is a good deal of superstar posturing, draping of large scarves over and around himself, clowning around in his notably charming fashion. It gets a little wearisome. Part of the Great Hall concert is included in this video, but the impact of the concert-only VHS is so much greater. Pavarotti is in stupendous voice, inspired, even! It is singing that blazes and makes the world whole again! Every offering is saturated with the genius of his phenomenal communicative gifts, and matched by the voice at its ecstatic best in every way! Impossible to overstate the astonishing example of the singing art given to the world by way of a clearly enraptured Chinese audience. The travel-docu part of the film is 2 stars and largely forgettable, but the singing is way 5 stars. That makes 4 stars in my book!- the extra rating surely standing for immense gratitude at having lived while this man was exercising his rare art! Something indeed to be grateful for.

This is one of Lama Ole Nydahl's most captivating books, one of his best. It's a superb book about Diamond Way Buddhism. The Lama Ole you get in person, full and every time he teaches, is richly present in this book about his honeymoon in Nepal, his conversion, and SO much after that! He's a great teacher, a realised teacher. Kingdom politics have been played for centuries, perhaps especially in exile. Whatever the real meaning behind the ongoing controversy of two Black Karmapa 17 claimants, Lama Ole Nydahl's teaching is refined by truth tested, a legacy of buddhist teaching that affords faith in the truth, and the understanding attained from it. Entering the Diamond Way is rich and clear, and a beacon of hope.

Issued with typical discernment by Bel Canto Society, this black and white VHS tape of an all-Puccini concert in her native country presents Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballe singing six major arias, conducted by Gianfranco Masini. Visual quality of the film is barely mediocre (the theatre's chandeliers are wickedly glaring during the camera's long-shots), the orchestra is occasionally untidy, but sound quality is fine except for a single wobble at the beginning of the first aria. Caballe's singing is profound, and beautiful. If you love Caballe's art, you'll love this film which lasts about half an hour. If, on the other hand, you share, with many others, disapproving views with respect to Caballe's singing and interpretation, this film may drive you crazy. What some call indulgent, mannered, and the like, I would characterize simply as Montserrat Caballe's pure musical art. It is an art admirable to me for its MUSICAL perfection, nothing more, nothing less. There exist such divergent views with respect to what constitutes great operatic art, one is lost attempting to forge a consensus of any kind - I suspect one loves, or one does not. Beyond that, however, musicianship must be the supreme attribute of any musician; in my view, it alone informs the art of music with an essential humanist aesthetic - not a particular voice, or facility, or style, or repertory. Important constituent elements these may be, yet alone they cannot create an eternal art. A singer, no less than any other, must be a musician in order to engage an authentic musical art. Careers come and go, but are no standard for discerning the real thing, musical or otherwise. Caballe's musicianship is rare, and is life-affirming in this brief concert. The audience on hand is discriminating and adoring, and adds viewing excitement, but Caballe's art is perfect to the point it is impossible to cleave oneself from it even for a moment. I recommend it to you with fervor. For me, earthly exile is made more bearable through the everlasting musical art of this woman.

Tedious? Hardly! This critical biography of Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a brilliant and masterful piece of work. Solzhenitsyn's life and art, his epic and singular 20th century struggle, are persuasively treated with courage and truthfulness, and absolutely first-class literary accomplishment by novelist D. M. Thomas. Rarely have I encountered a more affecting piece of biographical literature! Solzhenitsyn's complexities seem to overload the century, and Thomas' patient and exceptionally intelligent narrative follows the thread of every turn with a novelist's master plan giving us, in the end, a scorching and beautiful appreciation of one of the rare writers of the 20th century. The book is a compendium of modern Russian history as much as anything else, and it serves its subject well in refusing to varnish either the man or his milieu; Soviet history, especially with respect to the jarred lives of most of its great artists, is already known as one of history's great tragedies, and Thomas traces Solzhenitsyn's life-long transformation from Soviet man to Russian icon with meticulous care, and with a miraculous understanding of the wayward chagrin of history not often articulated in the biographer's art. It's a massive book, yet because every word is made essential the narrative sails with genuine authority, and with a special beauty. This is an important book, I would say even a gifted book, as indeed befits the story of one of the authentic geniuses of modern literature. Highest recommendation without reservation.

A soulful, utterly absorbing look at the world of Paul Klee. Not only does the film not shy from Klee's interior life, it revels in revealing it - through his paintings, journals, writings, drawings. Even Klee's extensive cataloguing habits are examined with love. I agree with another reviewer there has been no film like this made about an artist before. It's devastatingly fine, beautifully made. The film's riveting cohesion openly resembles Klee's paintings - Michael Gaumnitz's understanding of Klee's work is huge, and the rituals with which he attends his subject are profound. Presentation of the art is wondrously crafted. Every frame is a joy to watch and pulls the viewer deeper and deeper into the heart of Klee's own wonder. It's a remarkable experience indeed. To understand Klee, indeed to love him, is to see this perfectly revealing film. A hundred stars!

This is an exquisite video. Baryshnikov is in superb form, and there's ever so faint a touch of world-weariness around the edges of these pieces, informing even Baryshnikov's copious perfection, which makes for a beautiful, rich viewing experience. Push Comes To Shove, especially, is sweet and ironic, and hearing the audience chuckle now and again adds to the depth of artistic triumph that marks each piece on this dvd. Tharp's ideas crystallize with snap and magic, and Baryshnikov delivers exactly what every moment asks. His legendary nonchalant classicism changed the world, and surely the heart of every person who ever saw this man dance, and these Tharp pieces make his insouciance ineffaceable. Amanda McKerrow wows in the Glazunov 'Little Ballet', and Baryshnikov's partnering is lithe and understated, intimate,even. Wonderful stuff. One of the greatest things you can ever see is Baryshnikov's solo tour of 'One More For The Road', at the end of the Sinatra Suite. Tharp's luscious familiarity is all over it, beginning to end, but in 'One More For The Road', Baryshnikov reaches a fusion of idea and means that flat out overwhelms. It's vivifying in its greatness: inevitable becomes irresistable. Pretty neat. It's too bad ballet is a forgotten word in any culture, but inexcusable in a rich one. People don't know what they're missing. Get this dvd and reaffirm your faith.

There's nothing enlightening in the pages of this book - it is pure, old-fashioned American drivel. The book's shtick is honed, but its creed is unbelievable. From beginning to end, the content here is more demogoguery than journalism (witness the grinding chapter on the dynamics of public service, and the regressive huffing and puffing on the rearing of children) One cannot progress more than half a page in this tiresome epic without receiving yet another big helping of self-righteous gruel; a mush served in soured old schoolmarm style, pathetically old-fashioned, all charmless and prissy. The book (interminable, by the way, at a mere 200 pages!) manoeuvers the 'hot-button' issues one by one, pretends to break open each one, shake it free of the 'imprisoning' imposed on it by people who actually think, finally reducing it to the size of a few miserable scavenger notions of right and wrong. It can be a fascinating ride, as demogoguery often is, but one would be mistaken to set a moral compass by the vain, predictable and heartless conclusions drawn in this bestseller. I don't think I've ever encountered a book more obsessed with the idea that someone might possibly get something in this country that he or she doesn't deserve to have! What gets presented here is a mongrol drone of the most demeaning variety, a witless message that reads like a kind of upside-down Horatio Alger with his socks on his nose, thinking everyone smells what he smells! What a forlorn book this is; that it sits at the top of the bestseller charts is but another alarming bellweather of a culture in decline. My recommendation to anyone considering reading this book is to stick to the tabloids - for their honesty, if nothing else.

Here is a Rachmaninov Third to treasure. More daring than Rubinstein's, forget Horowitz! and Argerich? Argerich is extraordinary and Gilels is deep; Argerich eats the soul of the piece, and Gilels leaves the soul of it ripened and burnished -ready for eating. This is a superb rendition of the Rachmaninov, out-classing all the others that come to mind. And Saint-Saens' marvelous G Minor- Gilels sets the third movement rockin and rollin, infusing those propulsive splashes with an imperial regard, and rescuing by elegance music that seems always to verge on an unsatisfying gallic curtsey. Is there nothing that escapes this pianist's understanding? The Paris Conservatory Society orchestra acquits itself as a perfect partner in everything they do here; I don't know Cluyten's work well, but one gets the feeling this superb orchestra could play by its own internal mechanics, so naturally do the players cohere. I have recordings of the Shostakovich by Ashkenazy, Postnikova, Richter- THIS rendition is written in language of the heart. This is supernatural playing of a colossal intelligence and sensibility. The seemingly infinite gifts of Gilels leave his great countryman's Prelude more beautiful than before, reeling in fire after spinning it round our heads! What an exceptional artist this man is! You cannot imagine the satisfaction given by the Rachmaninov; fail to purchase this disc at the risk of remaining merely enamoured - you could be all of beguiled!

In Letter no.89, Bernard writes to his friend, William of St Thierry, &quot;as I drew myself in my letter to you, so I really am..&quot; That sweet admission characterizes this book. An excellent translation that really LISTENS to Bernard's voice in its 560+ pages. A short essential Introduction by Beverly Mayne Kienzle helps guide the reader toward aspects of interest surrounding Bernard in the letters -- events in Cistercian history, admonitions to his monks, letters on the liturgy,etc. -- and discusses the place held by private letters in monastic literature. The translation lets Bernard live, and live he does! The 'oracle of Christendom' shows himself the most human of humanists, passionate and nearly wild, founding seventy monasteries, securing the recognition of Innocent II, creating the Kinghts Templar, and pouring his preaching to kindle the fire for a second crusade. This book's a worthwhile place to start tracking mediaeval history, by tracking a colossus. Spiffy chronology, bibliography, and table of letters, recipients &amp; dates makes the book easy to access for specific results. The last of the Fathers of the Church, Bernard's real light lies just under the pages, and that's tough for a translator; here's a translation that understands and discloses that essence. As welcomed and vital a book as Gilson's 'Mystical Theology of St Bernard.'

The three operas comprising Glass' trilogy are something special, but this disc of arias from those three operas is even better. The selections themselves, the pacing of the sequencing, and absolutely top-drawer performances make this a standout disc. It's a great introduction disc for those seeking to learn more about Philip Glass's operas without having to invest in the full length recordings, although Akhnaten especially is a masterpiece and more than worthy of the price for the complete opera. I've given this disc to many friends and received only grateful raves, even from those already familiar with Glass' music. Douglas Perry's singing deserves special mention; his singing of Evening Song from Satyagraha is perfect in every way, with immaculate phrasing and a kind of passion of restraint that is mesmerizing. Glass' intentions are deceptive to the ear; he is master of a simplicity that keeps giving. The selections from Einstein on the Beach are richly complex; even after years of listening, new directions continue to appear in the score, each time revealing another dimension, an idea not really noticed before will suddenly become clear and engaging, creating a wonderfully familiar listening experience. Beautiful stuff. The melismatic Bed aria from Einstein on the Beach is a joy, heartbreaking as it is. Milagro Vargas contributes passionate singing in the Window of Appearances, and some marvelous ensemble singing is generously spread throughout the entire disc. Glass' best work may be found in his opera scores, and this disc presents the cream of the cream. Check it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.

This book is an excellent primer on Chavez, warts and all. The challenge to the US Kozloff delineates fully and articulately, not least by spending ample time revealing his subject's severe awakening to political and global realities through prison, failure, and a lightning quick mind. The first three chapters patiently define the origins of Chavez's political consciousness, and make the rest of the book more important and substantial. Chapter 3 - 'TINA - There Is No Alternative' - is especially helpful in getting to the root of who Chavez is, and who he might become, and why his appears to be a success with unlimited possibilities in terms of resisting the hegemony of American foreign policy. True, Kozloff is an admirer of sorts, but he pulls no punches. There is much to be admired in Hugo Chavez, as the world witnessed during his recent no-nonsense address to the UN, where he clearly distinguished himself as a determined, even poetic, global thinker. Chapter 4 takes its time outlining the nefarious meddling of Gustavo Cisneros, documenting along the way Cisneros' cozying up to George Herbert Liquor Bush. This is one of the few books around casting a clear-headed overview of the IMF, the disastrous effects of NAFTA, and the early White House plots against Chavez involving Otto Reich (Lockheed Martin), Pedro Carmona, and the CIA. These ideas are fully documented throughout the book with 65 pages of scrupulously detailed notes. One of the most interesting findings in the pages of this book is the struggle against racism represented by Hugo Chavez. His grasp of world affairs and his love for Venezuela come to be seen as inseparable from that honorable struggle. An excellent antidote to the prevailing American government line, it's also an essential look at the aiding and abetting committed by American corporate media in conformist manipulation. A must read.

This is just the purest example of singing genius you will ever hear! Aretha's best work has always been in the recording ventures that are least commercially oriented- 'Soul 69', 'Hey Now Hey', and this incredible 2 disc set of gospel retrieval! 'Mary, Don't You Weep' sets the perfect tone, Aretha slipping in after the choir has sanctified the place up front. 'Old Landmark' is an astonishing bit of prestidigitation- how the ensemble stays together belies belief, nearly everything is built on the off-beat! 'How I Got Over' is utter joy! In pure church fashion, the audience is as much a part of the whole as are the musicians. Her 'Wholly Holy' turns Marvin Gaye's masterpiece toward the unrelievedly ethereal. Aretha's solo intro on 'You'll Never Walk Alone' is some of the most inventive, intimate, and sophisticated phrasing I've ever heard. Takes your breath away; I'm almost sorry when the choir finally comes in and pumps it up and away from her initial characterization. 'Never Grow Old' completes this Service with exultation. Aretha's phenomenal mastery of call-response, her genius on a rampage, and the ecstasy of the crowd makes for an unforgettable experience.

Ayya Khema's beautifully written account of her life reads like a rocket ship! From barely escaping Hitler's evil in Germany as a young Jewish girl, through marriages, children, and a thoroughgoing journey of sparkling life through myriad cultures and continents, to Buddhist nun and founder of a monastery -Nun's Island in Sri Lanka- to the final beautifully poignant full circle back with the founding of Buddha-Haus in Germany, here is an authentic story of liberation and of a gifted woman's joy of religion. Spiritual-odyssey-memoirs are a dime a dozen these days, many of them barely worth the effort, but 'I Give You My Life' has a genuine spirit attending it; not only a wonderful memoir, it contains a few memorable moments of supremely confident religious experience conveyed without guile, and with admirable simplicity. It's a pleasure to read and ends too quickly, yet everything has been covered beautifully and fully. Khema effortlessly leaves her spirit with you, the mark of a true teacher - and probably of a buddha. It's a wonderful book.

It may be too easy to over praise Rorem's symphonies, but this is an exciting recording of these wonderful pieces. Rorem's musical lanugage is perfected, and I for one hear as much Rorem the writer in these symphonies as Rorem the composer, as indeed one well might say about much of his musical oeuvre, the songs included. His attraction to text thus acquires another level, one important enough to understand and admire in order to plumb these musical scores as meaningfully as possible. The First and the Third symphonies seem especially generous in this subtext of their lean lines, the ideas fertile and beautifully cared for with craftsmanship, and an always original nobility. The French veins found in Rorem's music, a formidable and inviting aspect -decisive and not, impatient and not, lost and found- find vigorous new purpose in symphonic gesture. These are sly, tender, and witty scores played wonderfully, and are a feast of good fortune for the revival of so many neglected American scores; indeed, Naxos' hand in the rejuvenation cannot be overvalued. This recording company's considerable insight is uniquely rewarded here with the rich, distinctive playing of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, and Jose Serebrier. Like his unprecedented Journals, Ned Rorem's musical language is subtle, never wasteful, and always a joy to discover, finally to contemplate. Those unfamiliar with his songs can easily find their way there through these orchestral works. Highest recommendation for a unique recording.

Disc 2 of this double DVD set is a pulsing look at Daniel Barenboim and his immense world of music and art and indeed fine living - friends, discoveries, everything a gifted and elegant intelligence can thrive within. He comes across an interested, intriguing man of tremendous gifts and sensibilities. It's a joy to watch him work and relax, to witness his world, and it's easy to understand his artistic preeminence after 50 yrs living a musician's life. It's a film unafraid to present its subject as one who listens attentively to the requirements of great gifts, and man, does it make for a beautiful one. Beautifully, intelligently filmed and edited, the pacing's just right and the sound is superb, and a few nuggets from the concert are studded throughout - it's just right. As fine as the documentary is, the real gift of this set is Barenboim's concert at the Teatro Colon. The Mozart and Beethoven that open the concert are just the rumblings. From the Scarlatti sonata in D forward, Barenboim commits playing that in any age would be judged a supreme art. Such playing! He gives Ginastera's gemlike Danza de la moza donosa a performance of spectacular ease and mysterious colors. Barenboim's magical intelligence absolutely possesses the keyboard, spinning out Schubert and Chopin, a delectable Rosenthal, Villa-Lobos, on through encore after loved encore, until he himself finally closes the piano lid, indicating the necessary end. The Chopin's a revelation! An etude - a nocturne of sublime artfulness - the gods were with the maestro this night in Buenos Aires. The piano playing is STUPENDOUS, and I'm an old man with lots of experience up that river. It flat out overwhelmed me - I watched it twice in immediate succession! If you dont know this authoritative and elegant musician's musician, if you've not heard him play, this 2-disc set is THE perfect moment to wake up! A profound artist with humility that clearly underpins his art and makes it memorable beyond words. Honestly, the finest filmed piano concert I've ever experienced. The intense and loving air in the Teatro Colon comes right to you, beckoning. Dont miss it.

I once had a philosophy professor who referred to sociology as "queen of the pseudo sciences". There is a lot of information in this book. A number of chapters, especially the two on the cult of the dead and a shorter chapter called "Preaching To Their Eyes", practically throb with facts and charts and statistics. There are sensational (some are interesting) photographs of the street Catholicism which the author hopes will shed light. There is some theorizing, but that's kept to a minimum - thankfully, probably. I would have thought the idea of a sociologist exploring a subject like popular Catholicism in Italy might be foredoomed in terms of achieving an understanding that raises interesting questions and discovers interesting answers about an interesting subject, and I was right. The book reads like a text book, and it's snide. Little things peppered here and there are what that snideness is made of. Certainly anti-religious, although nothing overtly rude, but Veiled Threats is the take of a scientist of sorts on ancient phenomena of spirituality, and I yawned through most of it. A book giving us the 'voices' of the villagers and believers and their priests - those whom science has discarded as being uninterrupted by the so-called modern world - would be more interesting. It's a believability factor, I think. 2 stars for the book, another for the hyper-indigenous photos.

Pianist Marguerite Long tells the wonderful tale of her deep immersion in the music and the person of Gabriel Faure. With autobiographical regard, the pianist tells how she met Faure's music, then Faure himself, who nurtured her indefatigable performances of his highly charged scores. Marguerite Long clearly did the rest of us a huge favor by her passionate promotion of Faure's music, seemingly advancing its worth nearly singlehandedly into notice and esteem. She is a constant witness in speaking of the absolute importance of his music, and Faure's oft-spoken personal kindness and deeply set spiritual mastery leap off the page memorably in Marguerite Long's more than able prose. I came away from this slim book of reminiscence with a firm fix on Faure the man, and certainly his music. The story of Long's and Faure's artistic friendship is an attractive one for what it reveals of both the making of art and the forging of memory. Recommended with elan.

This is an essential recording of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, if not the all-around finest. As Cio-Cio San, Leontyne Price is always moving, if not always a perfect Puccini soprano. All the voluptuous sound for which she is both revered and sometimes criticised is here aplenty, yet there is an aspect of youthful care that keeps her from the vocal preening with which she was occasionally afflicted. I suspect that a great deal of her requisite discipline in this recording comes as much from Leinsdorf, as from anything else. Her duet work with Rosalind Elias is generously partnered, Elias delivering her customary gold. Richard Tucker sings technically flawlessly, as usual, even when Pinkerton seems to fade a bit due to exalted Tuckerisms. I have never been put off by Price's unique use of her chest voice -Jessye Norman's laudable effort notwithstanding, was there ever a more willful Carmen!- yet in this recording, her particular vocal mannerisms seem kept to a minimum, and those that are employed seem so consonant with the intense burgeoning of her Butterfly, again, I suspect, following the wisdom of Leinsdorf. I have loved this recording for years; the Highlights CD is even better for those who wane a bit sitting through an entire Puccini lovefest. It has kept faith across the years, and every innate mark of the superlatively polished artist Leontyne Price eventually became is present and in ravishing form throughout this early recording. Price's portrayal of Butterfly reveals all the sub rosa strength and none of the banal predictability associated with this overwrought character, leaving one filled with a genuine longing, and burnished to a convincing glow.

It's impossible not to love this recording! I have for years, and it stands the test of time. I met Scriabin's music through this classic recording, played many of these pieces across the years, and return to it again and again as to a fountainhead. Say what you will about the art of Horowitz over the years, his handling of these Preludes and Etudes is inerrant. I've not heard another pianist play Scriabin with such intimacy and understanding, Richter included. The alchemy that was Horowitz's alone is in unpartitioned play from beginning to end. His inscrutable ear lets him choose one miniature masterpiece after another, each one vital to his master plan, in the end not only revealing Scriabin's mastery of musical thought, but giving us an indelible guide to Horowitz's own genius. If you want to understand the contribution of Horowitz, walk past his others straight to THIS Scriabin disc, AND the Horowitz Plays Scarlatti disc. For me, these two recordings provide unique evidence of this pianist's most revealing gifts. The B-major Prelude is beautiful enough to melt stone. This recording reminds me of Gould's recording of Byrd and Gibbons - unexpected and perfect, and impossible to live without. In a world on overload, the music made here is witness of a great art. Don't delay the indisputable experience.

A great recording often manifests silently from inside the genuine humility, even doubts, of the artists laboring to create it. I suspect that is as apt a characterization as any of the effectiveness of this album. Leontyne Price has always been, to my mind, a marvelously transparent singer; one feels immediately her approach, and indeed her own trepidation on the high wire, as it were. This collection of Strauss is a model of that transparency. She is outside her safe zone here, albeit willingly and with customary copious voice, but it is, at least for those intimately familiar with Leontyne Price's voice, a land of no coasting and no boasting. And it is a remarkable triumph, with a fetching choice of material, and an incomparable version of the final scene of &quot;Salome&quot;. The quixotic magic of Price's Salome is something to experience, her work with Leinsdorf has never been more collaborative, and the Boston Symphony really sizzles! The superb aria from &quot;Ariadne&quot; is a perfect 'calling up' of the Salome, directly preceding it as it does and alerting the countryside of the imminent eruption of Salome's arresting disintegration to come. Absolutely splendid work from a prima donna of deservedly legendary status, with the additional treat of first-rate orchestral playing.

A shocking, thoroughly irregular, well-made film that fully exhibits the ravages of evangelical practice in America, cultic obsession embodied in a well-strategized assault on the spiritual innocence of children that is so abusive it begs the question "is this actually happening in America?" Absolutely unfathomable. As one evangelical mother says in the film "there are two kinds of people in this world - those who love Jesus and those who don't". Sound familiar? With us or against us. Yes, Haggard is creepsville (and hilarious, given his recent delicate revelations), and the scene with the children raising en masse a Reich arm of "blessing" toward a large cardboard statue of Bush is pure Orwellian theatre that chills to the bone. These poor children already lost to the madness of a few, the manipulation of their innocent emotional lives, their spontaneous weeping and gushing in the face of fevered verbal onslaught by the "leaders", the idiotic terror of glossolalia, the threats and coercion, and a palette of concoctions of death and dishonor that wait upon each child's next breath like a living demon - these things are intolerable. But truly scabrous is Becky Fisher, vicious "leader" of the camp, Children's Ministry expert (!), in the grip of mental illness, no one supervising her interior fantasy life, and certainly no one safeguarding the children on whom she visits huge wicked things. A big fat woman, she preaches how no child these days is willing to fast for God. There are a number of moments in the film that are laugh out loud, but the sorrow of its content, honestly, is a wound difficult to bear. To live in a nation that acquiesces to this kind of ignorance is burdensome; necessary, no doubt, as antidote, but a true sorrow for anyone with heart for the America we knew. Jesus Camp spotlights an American taliban tribe on the march, delusional warrior dogs at fever-pitch, crazy-eyed - possessed, really. Yes, everything for God except love. A tragedy in one act. Recommended if you've the stomach. Once on the other side of it, your sense of smell is sharpened, your back strengthened, and the rabble identified. Take heed, pilgrim.

I agree with another reviewer that a lot of unnecessary wandering in the wilderness makes this book a tiring effort to enjoy, but some of the reviews seem to miss utterly the author's intense perspective which is nothing less than a fervent glance at Richelieu unscourged. Levi's historical take is often speculative, or is it? Perhaps it's more an unsolicited testament of things from the vantage point of those whom many historians have decided, in their churning quest to install an egalitarian privilege, are easily brushed aside, their subject's particular paradigm having been in their view eclipsed.Richelieu himself, master of detail, would likely find himself more readily in Levi's book than in most textbooks and any number of insufficient biographies. You'll need a comprehensive understanding of the royal houses of Europe and the intricate volleying and snuggling between them to make sense of quite a bit of this book. Nor will you find a wholesale dismissal of the Roman Church's temporal politics here, and rightly so. This, after all, is history, not a fairyland for the democracy besotted. Even an Irish Times review on the back of the book can't help referring to "an allegedly devout mystery..." I suspect there are already too many allegedly brave biographies whose principle recommendation is a tawdry bias.Levi's book gives an unindicted account of the Cardinal and his world. I'm grateful for that, despite the book's onerous flaws - sometimes incoherent writing, an at times merciless academic posture, and some unnecessary repetition. Four solid stars, but then, I'm a stickler for the real thing.

An efficient introduction to Solti's life and legacy, on the lean side, but not an ungenerous film. Quite a bit of Solti's own comments gets lost between the echo of his accent and his expressive way of speaking - subtitles would be useful. I wanted more on his personal and professional relationship with Bartok, and more of his Mozart, but overall, the performance footage was interesting, providing a keen look at Solti's conducting, and a worthwhile look at a consistently compelling musical intellect along the way. The best thing about Solti's musicanship is his exacting rhythmic prescriptions - it's what makes his Mozart something special - and that unique aspect of his work is accented in the film with precision. His whole body teaches a kind of rhythmic concision, even his walk. It's interesting. Funny thing is - that intense concision is just what this film lacks. It lacks Solti's rhythmic spark. Too bad, but the documentary is well made, Solti is credibly revealing, and the candor of his music making comes through loud and clear. There's also some fine footage of an early Wagner recording with Nilsson. Any Solti fan will be satisfied with Making of a Maestro.

He WAS a yurodivye - a divine and crazy fox! & there ISNT a growing body of opinion that Testimony is a fraud or hoax! On the contrary, the rare film evidence of Shostakovich alive, to see him move and speak, and HIS MUSIC ITSELF easily vouch for the provenance of this harrowing book -- which is, nothing less than the epic inner life of a colossus, one of the great composer beings of any age. Testimony (AND the film based on it, by the way!) is as rich a self-revelation as you'll EVER encounter. End the controversies for yourself and READ IT. The self-drawn Man revealed-- a person of humor and fears, an excruciating man of magisterial gifts not plumbed even today, and a man of Humility. That last is important to say, because it stands and speaks winningly against the calumny which has been rehearsed like a curse over this book. Not only is Shostakovich's voice pure and penetrating, it resonates in tone and content with Vishnevskaya's intimate portrait of the man who wrote Katerina for her. And Ben Britten's personal notes are still another source of affirmation. But dont waste your time in shadows... The second movement of the First Piano Concerto is proof of this book. The Fourteenth Symphony is proof. The 15th Quartet, the ballet suites, the 3rd movement (Eternal Memory) of the 11th Symphony.... THIS is what you hear when you read Testimony. It's one of the enduring books of a lifetime, a compendium of sorrow read, in the end, only as joy. The lesson in humanity given by Shostakovich in the pages of this book HAS no price. five spiky stars times a hundred!

There is something all too memorable about the SOUND of Eva Marton's voice, pure and simple. This recording came early in her career, at least early in the move to Italian repertoire for this singer, and she's in providential vocal ease here. And there are a few surprises - the drama with which she invests 'Mio babbino caro' is telling; where Caballe conquers by purity of emission and fluent agility, Marton is unafraid of the wisdom of pain in her rendition. The high B at the end of 'Donde lieta' is pungent and heroically round, and her 'In questa Reggia' is cream of the crop. Marton's Turandot is a great one, especially the filmed Vienna staging by Hal Prince, with Maazel conducting, and this disc's version is top-drawer. This is not bel canto art, but the sound of Eva Marton's voice, the timbre and the rapture of its honeyed roar is something unmatched. She's more of a musician than many singers and it serves her well in the Puccini on this disc. Giuseppe Patane proves himself again to be a singer's best friend, as one of the supreme purveyors ever of the operatic conductor's art. Even if you never become a fan, if you've not heard Eva Marton's singing, you owe yourself a listen to this CD.

The 'Suite Italienne' is Stravinsky's re-visitation of Pergolesi by way of his own 'Pulcinella', music from that 1925 ballet score here recast for violin and piano. The outcome is rewarding indeed in the hands of Cho-Liang Lin and Ande-Michel Schub. Lin's understanding of Stravinsky's neo-classical aspirations is direct and affectionate, and Schub's playing is beautifully tempered. Stravinsky once remarked that 'Pulcinella' was "my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible." And indeed, while Stravinsky was to cast many a look backward, the Suite Italienne is among the most successful of all his flirtations with antiquity. The Variations within the Gavotte are just magical! The 'Duo Concertante' is the centerpiece of this recording, and it brings forth from these two players instrumentalism of surpassing authority and beauty. The sublime 'Cantilene', and the small and haunting 'Dithyrambe' contain some of Stravinsky's most engaging chamber work. Incidentally, the Ex-Dushkin Strad owned and played on this recording by Lin, while in my view not the instrument that the Guarneri del Gesu is (also owned by Mr. Lin), seems a perfect choice here, warming the air while paying homage to the marvelous spaces inherent in Stravinsky's scaffolding. I've always thought the transcription (made by the composer and Dushkin) of the 'Divertimento' to be a more successful piece than the original symphonic suite. What insight Cho-Liang Lin offers here! He's one of the supreme fiddlers of our day, easily out-classing Perlman, whose nervous assurance often drives the music away from itself, and whose reputation seems regularly unsupported by the recorded evidence. Lin's rhythmic articulation is without peer, and his staunch musical common sense provides the true ground requisite for the natural unfolding of an unsentimental magnificence on vivid display in this superb recording. This is a major recording of some of Stravinsky's most intimate music, and earns a devoted recommendation!

Five stars go to Cho-Liang Lin's marvelous account of the enchanting Sibelius Violin Concerto, one of the greatest concertos in the violin repertory. Though I remain convinced that no extant version of this piece rivals Oistrakh's recording with Ormandy and the Philadelphia, this is the only candidate for second place, and for all that, it's a more modern reading, sensitively attuned to a modern understanding while remaining utterly true to Sibelius' abundance. The broken octaves of the First Movement that rise and fall in that cataclysmically lyrical passage are so wonderfully phrased by this young Chinese master of music that one almost forgets Oistrakh's perfection, and indeed the spell cast here is an enduring one. The final Movement, which has been described as &quot;a polonaise for polar bears&quot;(!) is perfect as can be. I admire Lin's playing tremendously. His recording of Stravinsky's Duo Concertante and the Italian Suite is an equally fine venture, and one of my favorite recordings. The importance of the Nielsen simply escapes me. It's a unique piece of writing, but one certainly not in the league owned by Sibelius' masterpiece. Salonen seems hooked on Nielsen, though I suspect he has recorded so much of it in part because Nielsen is terribly neglected by many conductors. Ambitious conductors seem often to fancy finding that open niche in which to make a particular mark without taking enormous risks, though that comment is not intended as a put-down of Salonen's overall contribution. He's a conscientious conductor, certainly his collaboration here follows Lin's path with subtlety, and his affinity for contemporary music in particular seems genuine and often fruitful. In any case, his Nielsen recordings don't strike me as arising out of the same ardent love for this composer as do those of Herbert Blomstedt and the SF Symphony, some of which are even interesting. That being said, the Nielsen (and certainly the Sibelius) is enhanced by Lin's magnificent violin -it's a Guarneri, if I recall correctly- which possesses one of the richest and most incumbent sounds of any stringed instrument I've ever heard! If you want to hear magnificent sounding violin music, as well as some of the keenest and most unaffected playing around, get this recording. Cho-Liang Lin's encompassing rendition of Sibelius' monumental Concerto will reward you in spades!

Here is an authentic man of genius! To read Yehudi Menuhin is an experience comparable to hearing him play the Chaconne, itself an experience that bears no easy comparisons. Every page of this book, and indeed of any number of his writing excursions (the magnificent essay 'Peace and Culture' given by him in his association with UNESCO and the interviews with David Dubal come to mind), bursts with a vital intelligence and egalitarian humanity uncommon to modern man. This is a revised edition of his original memoirs, updated to the present. Everything is here, the profound thought of one of the truly humane artists of the twentieth century, the magnificent story of his family, his parents and gifted sisters, his early life, the splendid accomplishments in the true service of humanity that have marked his later life so deeply. One is compelled to comment upon the nature of the family into which he was born, so perfect an incubator for one such as Yehudi Menuhin, an authentic genius requiring an authentic environment in which to develop. Menuhin doesn't disappoint the reader, he amply and brilliantly illumines the story of his family in a devoted and balanced account of lives of high human principles fully lived , and proof of the essential role his family played in his life is clear in the full measure of this man's life and work. Anyone with an interest in authentic human philosophy, in an examination of those elements that characterize the authentic role of the artist in society, will find this book a joy! Nothing forced here, nothing of pretense. This book is but the calm and elegant persuasion of a consummate human being and a genuine artist.

This book surprised me! The bare-boned, almost meditative, style with which Lourie endows the ruminations of `The Great Gardener' is but one part of a brilliant Idea on how most effectively to flesh out the despot. Lourie underplays everything - Stalin's conscience, his political acumen, his brutality- underplays it until it completely dominates the reader's mind and heart. Early on, the skin of Stalin begins to creep onto our own frame, such adept fiction this is. It `s a remarkable feat, and makes a complete success of this book. What Lourie flushes out, almost by a kind of telepathy, is a riveting look at the world from Stalin's mind; Uncle Joe's obsession with Trotsky's being, and yet especially with Trotsky's feverishly tended manuscript, gives the book a tight focus, but the mesmerizing moments come as Stalin glistens in the depravity of his brutality. I think, if one pays attention, it's a book that convicts us of our own inhumanities. And the book's feeling of briefness works to amplify everything within. Check it out - the haunting is long lasting.

I say run to get this recording, you know how briefly they stay in print. This is a gleaming collection of Caballe's art. A wide span of recording years is covered here. Beginning delightfully with &quot;Hijo de la luna&quot; and a set of Spanish songs, the magic comes on quick. A recent version here of &quot;My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice&quot; is an irreplaceable treasure. Such understanding in the singing, such intelligent and mighty phrasing - just wonderful! And &quot;Io son l'umile ancella&quot; is rendered with colossal artistry, the final rising phrase so laden with genuine patience, it turns the merely artful into true art. It's a remarkable rendering of Cilea's aria. Disc 2 is the more expansive of the two- Caballe's take on &quot;Sempre libera&quot; ('67 version here) has no real peer, except maybe Sutherland's. The Charpentier is delicious as can be. What is that lingering feeling around this woman's singing? She is an uncompromising artist, we're so lucky to have these recordings.

Craft's amazing gifts as a writer are as interesting as is the story of the extraordinary relationship of which he writes. His famous and intimate long-time relationship with Stravinsky and wife Vera makes for fascinating, if not fast, reading. Some of the most interesting people on the planet make their appearance throughout the pages of this massive book (including Auden, Huxley, Spender, and so many more), and all are treated with a prepossessing intelligence, wit and intellectual candor by this remarkable conductor/musician/friend, Robert Craft. If Craft's own art is not that well known to the man in the street, all the better for the role he assumes in his many books about Stravinsky -that of an 'intimate without portfolio', as it were, able to illumine Stravinsky from the inside out, no small feat indeed. Of course, Craft's own art is indeed prodigious, as his many definitive recordings of Stravinsky's music, made since the composer's death, have proven time and again. Page after page of this 'diary' reveals the unique friendship between a genius and his 'brother-son'; Craft's ability to disappear within his observorship in order to reveal the man to whom he devoted such a great part of his life seems infinite, and so admirable. Craft's is a most perceptive mind, a mirror-mind to Stravinsky's in many ways, and more than a glimpse is thereby afforded of one of the titanic creative forces of the twentieth century. He acted as Stravinsky's alter-genius, if you will, and the results here are spellbinding. The book's journey traverses the world, and includes lengthy episodes in Venice, Paris, Los Angeles, Switzerland- all critical places in Stravinsky's history. The pages of the book devoted to Vera Stravinsky, wife, painter, and someone clearly especially loved by Robert Craft, that appear toward the end of the volume after the detailing of Stravinsky's funeral in Venice (of which there is a marvelous photo, the Orthodox priests in fierce array!), are lovely, loving and devoted, and worthy of mention. Craft's books are meat indeed for the Stravinskyphile, and even the uncommitted admirer can find in this work (as in his 'Theme and Variations', in the Dialogues, etc.) an epic chronicling of our time, and will find sure residue of the world's becoming modern through the uncompromising art of Igor Stravinsky. Impossible to overstate either the importance of this book as a testament, or the value of encountering it.

There is so much to admire in these four discs, it is silly not to own them, however much I have always believed it wise not to run headlong in an induced ecstasy into the arms of everything Leontyne Price has recorded. In my view, the highlights of this collection are many, including a perfectly modulated &quot;Dove sono&quot;, an exquisite &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot;, one that surely enhances Handel's immortality, and a simply remarkable recording of &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;; the &quot;Willow Song&quot; is as divinely joined as any recorded version I have heard, and, expectedly, the arias from &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot; and &quot;Suor Angelica&quot; are just wonderful. The first and final argument for purchasing this set, however, remains Price's peerless rendition of &quot;Gluck, das mir verblieb&quot; from Korngold's &quot;Die Tote Stadt&quot;. Here is manifested perfectly articulated singing of magnificent proportions; intelligent, cultivated, a performance far above the score, though this is not inconsequential music, no matter that it touches upon those elements often referred to as kitsch. (Not so, though that remains fodder for another, different discussion from this one.) The 'Mariettalied' is surely a beautiful aria, yet Price's immense musical understanding, and indeed the relationship of her inborn musical conscience to her singing gifts, raises it to Art. It is a flawless, ineffacable, and utterly inevitable performance, one to be treasured at twice the price of this set! Finally, disc 4 presents not only an attractive episode from Poulenc's mesmerizing &quot;Dialogues des carmelites&quot;, and a ravishing version of Micaela's aria so touchingly sung, but concludes in a burst of genius with Britten's &quot;Gloriana&quot;! Go on, deprive yourself not a moment longer of the glad enjoyment, and often surprise, found in this perfectly conceived and beautifully executed collection!

Leslie Gerber's on the money with the comments above. A colossal set with incomparable HEARING (playing) by Starker. What a MUSICIAN, my gosh!! Prelude of the First Suite gives IMMEDIATE peace-- it's overwhelming! the way Starker embodies the ends of phrases -- such patience!-- this is Bach eternal! Where Fournier can move chapel into dance court, Starker makes no compromises- the metaphysical comes first! The AIM sometimes less elegant, but pure temple Breathing once inside. For me, the god Fournier makes everlasting Bach. I know this, still a part of me made conversion of some kind hearing the Truth of Starker's completely immediate Art in Prelude of the First suite! I tell you, Suite freaks, if YOU havent heard this recording you need to. Wispelwey is bright and free, I know. Starker, however, is Religion without artifice. Check it for yourself. I heard the Mercury recordings only once & they stunned me. I should listen again. Tough to imagine another recording exceeding the depth of pure musical intention embodied in this one, but there's nothing valedictorian in Starker's understanding. This is Pure Musical Art, & as good as it gets.

Impeccable scholarship and brisk, concise prose are the drawing cards of Garry Wills' new book. In the blink of an eye, Mr Wills dissects several of the more onerous fantasies of the modern papacy. In this post-Christian age, Mr. Wills takes up the case for papal reform more effectively than did the protestant savants in the ages of faith. The sections on the Church's relations with Jews, on pedophile priests and their enabling heirarchies, and on birth control are especially telling. It takes a Catholic to write a book this clear-headed about the papacy. Garry Wills' Catholicism gives him not only the authority, but indeed the courage, to make a substantive contribution to the discussion of these matters moral, doctrinal, and, finally, human. And substance is indeed the outcome of Mr. Wills' frontal assault on the deceitful structures of the modern papacy. Especially interesting is the conclusive parallel drawn between the mindset of Pius IX and that of John Paul II. Indeed, in this age of the puzzling popular `canonisation' of the living pope, it is good to be reminded of the face behind the mask. Wills' continual references to the writings of Raymond Brown, a theologian from the little leagues, is annoying at times, but he uses the particular references chosen to good effect in making his own arguments. Catholics should be proud to have such thoughtfulness as that displayed by Garry Wills working on their behalf. Unfortunately, viewing some of the reviews on this page, it sadly seems still true that nothing confounds the Catholic, especially the American Catholic, like a good romp at the papacy. Nevertheless, this is an important book, and one I suspect that will more than stand the test of time. Highest recommendation!

This is a good book, but perhaps not a great book. An affectionate book, yet a book that seems somehow to hold itself distant from its subject, Dmitri Shostakovich. Probably those not familiar with Shostakovich's life will find in this book a comprehensive study of the composer and his milieu; written in a 'round-table' style that utilises scores of reminiscences and contributions from artists and friends who knew Shostakovich, a complete enough picture is given of who Shostakovich was, yet, for me, something is missing. For all its massiveness, its wealth of information, its affection, the author seems incapable of revealing the essence of Shostakovich's life and work; the telling of someone's life, and a genuine expression of the meaning of that life are distinctly different things. For all the controversy surrounding Shostakovich's &quot;Testimony&quot; (most of it unbearably inconsequential), and despite its thinness compared to this giant tome, it nonetheless is a book alive with the presence of Shostakovich, something glaringly missing from this effort. This is a warm book, but perhaps not a true enough one to do justice to one of the greatest composers, certainly the greatest symphonist, of the twentieth century. For those of us fortunate enough to find ourselves Shostakovich addicts, Shostaholics, as it were, this well-made book is simply not enough- not true enough, not close enough, not intense enough an experience to match our love of this man's imcomparable music.

A film unlike any other, even among Palmer's impressive body of work, Testimony is an unrelieved, excruciating, gallantly bitter ride, riveting in conception and execution from beginning to end. It's a film of epic sorrow and pain, a film of and about truth, subversion, and art. It's filled gloriously with Shotakovich's defiantly eternal music, and Ben Kingsley's performance as Shostakovich is shocking and profound, his masterfully trained actor's voice used like a needle point intelligence through every frame, tracing his character's fate with a mocking sing-song sarcasm that tells volumes. I believe Kingsley's beautifully cadenced performance reveals the film's intent as effectively as do Shostakovich's scores. Hyper-alert to every cinematic possibility, Palmer proves himself again and again every bit as much editor as fantasist. He maintains a close to the bone intent throughout, and his fastidiousness as a filmmaker is stupefying. Palmer uses cinematic artifice brilliantly, devotedly - the way Mozart used humor, and Bach faith. Every scene stings, nothing is wasted, every gesture feeds the overwhelming whole. The film's ending recruits the 13th Symphony ("Babi Yar") as tragic chorus, delivering a harrowing climax - the Easter Island-like statue head of Stalin tumbling with fire and chasing Shostakovich becomes a fantastic spectacle of delirious terror ultimately impossible to forget, grotesque and exotic. Palmer clearly refuses the bandwagon of tired old fools carping ignorantly decade after decade about Volkov's exacting and undeniable book, finding in it the truth about tyranny - Shostakovich's truth. The film is a masterpiece - a word one is careful using about Tony Palmer's work simply because he has committed more than one! - but let that praise be heard here. Testimony is a film awash with the gifts of genius. Especially noteworthy: Ronald Pickup ("The Life of Verdi") as Tukhachevsky, Felicity Palmer's luminous singing in the 14th Symphony, John Shirley-Quirk's amazing singing in the 13th, Barshai's vivid conducting, which commands the inner power of Shostakovich's music with consummate finesse, and discerning art direction by Paul Templeman and Chris Bradley. One's understanding of Shostakovich's great music is incomplete without knowing this potent work of cinematic art. Recommendation with nary a trace of reservation.

A beautiful and worthwhile book on Maria Callas, in a sort of guise of coffee table tome. The ivory flap cover is almost Raphaelite, but it's the photos inside really worth the price of admission. The text has little that's new. Pieces of Callas' private diaries and letters provide a unique, not extensive glance at her private life, forming at times a melancholy sense of a tenuous woman's personal fears and difficulties. Refuting a rumor that Meneghini wanted her to stop singing altogether, she denied that was his view, saying "It is not his view, because if it were I would never have sung again." Some interesting bits on Elsa Maxwell, who was apparently in love with Callas, and some of the finest photographs of Maria I've seen anywhere. The book is a genuine homage to her art, and there's nothing cheap or filler about it. It's an experience to dominate any Callas lover for a few hours, and the kind of book you can return to repeatedly. Molto recommendation.

With due respect to another of the reviews on this page, this is the best of the recorded versions of this magnificent symphony. The symphony utilises various texts on death and the psychology of despair, and is a perfect hymn to survival. Such is the constant mystery of Shostakovich's art. Perhaps in no other symphony is it plumbed as in the Fourteenth. The musicianship of Bernstein seems happily to manifest most clearly in the artists with whom he chooses to work, and in few other instances that come to mind is this more true than his choice of soprano Teresa Kubiak. The Malaguena, and Lorelei, touch the ineffable. Bernstein's telepathy with Shostakovich makes palpable the bitterness, joy and humor in the heart of torture. This is a great version of the work, a preternatural symbiosis of composer and conductor. I'm astonished with each listening, and would venture that Kubiak's singing rivals Vishnevskaya's in the work. Bernstein follows his heart from beginning to end. Would that a mere dirge could achieve as much. It's a work to stave off death and its sorrows forever. Copies of this edition are surely still available.

Francescatti's Beethoven concerto is shapely and engaging, and the playing is warm and refined throughout. My ultimate preferences with this piece are Shumsky's 1988 recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Davis, and Menuhin's recording under Furtwangler, but I admire Francescatti's beautiful lines and devoted intelligence. The reason, however, for seizing this remarkable offer (who knows anymore how long any recording will remain available!) has to be Oistrakh's incomparable recording of the Sibelius under Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orch. Of the many versions of this great work, for me, there is none that matches this particular Oistrakh/Ormandy recording. Of more recent versions, Cho-Liang Lin turns in a stupendously musical performance of this piece - convincing and beautiful. I believe five or six D. Oistrakh recorded versions of this concerto remain in print; his Melodiya recording with Rozhdestvensky is a rival, but Ormandy's command of the glacial cast of Sibelius' orchestral writing is just amazing, and, underpinning Oistrakh's inimitable conception, the playing of the Philadelphia Orch is rich and perfectly attuned to Sibelius. The remastered sound is first-rate, you'd think it was a modern recording. Whether you love this concerto, or dont yet know it, you've found here a defining performance to reveal its mysteries. I've treasured this recording for thirty years, and urge you to give it a hearing.

Reading some of the other reviews here, I wonder if I'm in the same universe. I feared this dvd for a long time, having been bleached of hope by years of indifferent if not hostile reviews and commentary about it. I think Puccini planned that NO performance of Butterfly would ever truly be sufficient, truly right. But surely, Ponnelle's valiant film effort comes close. For me, closer than any other available dvd version. Two reasons front and center - the singing of Mirella Freni and Karajan's handling of the score with the Vienna Philharmonic. Having just this past week watched the Butterflys of Cedolins and Barker, Freni's magnificent singing is proof that the mitred age of Italian opera is passed. Any musician knows there's no comparison between Freni's singing and that of Cedolins and Barker, both of whom offer respectable enough versions of the score. Freni sings grand opera from the inside out, and THAT grace is found missing in every other available dvd of this opera. If the exposition of the human voice, yes even in verismo art, is your reason for opera, this film will love you, and you it. Mirella Freni's musicianly command of Puccini's eternally fecund score is overwhelming from beginning to end. The singing is epic, intelligent and purged of self regard. No less fertile is Karajan's intense way with Puccini, fevered but ever cool, ever rigorous. The Vienna orchestra finesses textures like a cat, every nuance cared for with golden perfection - it's a beautiful thing! Christa Ludwig embraces the role of Suzuki with incomparable singing and a riveting attentiveness as Cio-Cio-San's confidant. Her singing of the incantations that open Act 2 is easily equal to Cossotto's turn with Price. Forget the complaints about lonely heaths and cramped houses. Ponnelle creates a bewitching exterior with coastal grasses; the interior sets are never onerous or pretentious, reaching in fact a tremendous peacefulness by film's end. Ponnelle's genius with colors and texture, and certainly his motive behind the camera is remarkable, emotional, noble. What more can you ask for? The discolation from lip-synching is noticable but minimal, and even used to engaging advantage by Cio-Cio-San who occasionally assumes interior reflection by eschewing singing altogether, something impossible on a live stage. It's not perfect but damned near, a worthwhile filmed vision of an inexhaustible opera.

This book is as much a penetrating portrait of Stalin's Russia as it is a fierce look at surviving as an artist in Stalin's hands. Apart from the rich legacy of his music, Shostakovich is a fine example precisely because he survived. Those of us who find Volkov's 'Testimony' a harrowing, revealing book will dive into these pages with gusto and fly through to the end. Those who suspect 'Testimony' to be a fraud might not bother with this book, and that's too bad because it provides a genuine fleshing out of Stalin and his closest henchmen (Zhdanov, especially, is afforded thorough treatment), some beautiful pages on Shostakovich's inner life, and not a few engaging views of a number of other important artists who lived and worked in a crucible of terror day after day. Volkov courteously dispenses with the ridiculous "holy fool" controversy in his prologue. The author is strongest when he composes life from inside the experience of survival in Soviet Russia. It's one thing to admire Shostakovich's genius, quite another to reach the underpinnings of a man who was more a gentleman fixed on physical (and therefore emotional and artistic) survival than he was a musical prophet. At that point, we're experiencing something well beyond biography. That is Volkov's unique gift. The focus is indeed Shostakovich, but the lessons reach farther. There are some fine photographs included - pen and inks of Akhmatova and Pasternak by Annenkov, the spiky, not often seen 1933 portrait of Shostakovich by Akimov, and an unforgettable photograph of a very young Shostakovich looking directly and defiantly at the camera, in which he seems to foretell all the pain and glory to come. If you're looking for a searing rehearsal of the meaning of freedom, I suggest this book.

Hard to put a finger on it. LOVE the music - Villa-Lobos is ALWAYS exciting (even his Quartets are wild and fresh), and the Bachianas Basilieras is a magical score. Tilson Thomas attends to the colors, but there's something lackluster about the whole performance. Something missing in the conducting. I find myself NOT in a repeat play mode with this recording! Fleming parades an overstuffed voice in the doleful #5, why is she lately so unnecessary??? Gosh, I'd so like to like her art, but it seems she's lost and passing through some weird phase vocally. Hope it doesnt last. The performances on this recording have too much pretense around them, & it's a real negative. These folks are young and gifted, maybe I'm a crank... but there's no reason not to always make music with integrity, is there? On Joan Baez' first or second album she recorded the No.5.. I'd really like to hear that recording again.

In a brief and savory 200 pages, Buddhist master Soyen Shaku (1856-1919), who would become chief abbot of both Engakuji and Kenchoji monasteries, presents seventeen peerless examples of what a sermon can be, tackling immortality, faith, ethics, the worldly and the transcendent, sacrifice, and ignorance and enlightenment among other subjects. These concise, fulfilling essays were given in 1905-1906 during the Zen monk's visit to America. The addresses that comprise this compendium mark the initial phase of the introduction of Buddhism on the popular level to the United States, delivered as Shaku crossed the continent - literally and symbolically - from west to east, and translated during that sojourn by D.T. Suzuki, who edited the sermons for publication and contributes a preface for the present edition. Every chapter, every page is illumined by the clearest thinking and the calmest, and therefore most convincing, conviction. In an age when religious understanding is degraded and undermined by absurd public spectacle, this collection of sermons serves as a trenchant witness to the invigorating silence of belief, while indeed providing a heady exposition of Buddhist thought and principles. This edition fortunately includes two addresses by Shaku on the Buddhist view of war stressing, as do the semons, the Buddhist perspective on personal responsibility. Exceptionally enlightening is an included reprint of a letter written by Shaku in 1896 to Dr. John Barrows, entitled here 'Reply To A Christian Critic'. One can't help believing that the pseudo-religionists whose violent heads and hearts have once again risen to fever pitch in America recently over a human being's rights to live and to die would be served far better by reading this Zen monk's quiet and reasoned rebuke than by the corporate media whores who feed them false importance to the detriment of us all. Highest recommendation.

The Philokalia is the supreme ascetical text of two thousand years of Christian history. The Greek title means love of the beautiful, the exalted, the good. Its subject is an interpretation of life in the Divine Christ. St Philotheos' 'Forty Texts on Watchfulness' especially, and Theophanis the Monk's 'Ladder of Divine Graces' (both in vol. 3) sing like a burning bush! This is ancient Christianity, supple and free. It's interesting that Peter of Damaskos, in the pivotal texts on the Eight Stages of Contemplation, seems to borrow the language, the gestures, even, of Buddhist thought, Zen in particular. John of the Cross shook of a kindred understanding of emptiness, but Desert spirituality, the Greek Fathers are something else again, something more striking, more pungent than even the Discalced mystic. The Philokalia's entire creed is 'know thyself.' Constantly the text presents both a belief system and a system of ascetic philosophy and practice that curse the whimpering centuries as they pass now. The disciple's world isn't pretty, and these men from the centuries of the early Church after the Declaration of Constantine preach a honeyed death in order to live, as do the Psalms. These priests and hermits roamed Egypt and Palestine living the lessons and injunctions, and the bliss even as they were composing the Philokalia. The Greek texts first translated into Slavonic became grafted to Russian spirituality, and are the richer for that; the real treasure of the Philokalia reveals itself disinterestedly to any reader who behind the primitive gestures of antique exegesis sees only That Which Is, and thereof understands himself whole, like Gregory of Sinai, Callistus and Ignatius. The Philokalia is unbuttered Christianity you won't find in churches. Therefore, highest recommendation to you of right intention.

I'm an ardent admirer of Sokurov's films, and a lover of Shostakovich's immortal music, but this film is a sleeper. Fanatical as I am about the music of Dmitri Shostakovich, I hoped for so much more from the director of 'Alexandra' and so many other extraordinary films. Despite some interesting photo montages, some not seen before, and despite a truly worthy appreciation of Shostakovich and his all too human story on the part of the director, the film never truly captivates, never provides what it could have with respect to a fresh look at one of the giants of 20th century music. Monsaigneon's film is better, and Tony Palmer's 'Testimony' is a miracle of truth and cinematic invention. Like another reviewer here, I recommend renting this piece, not buying it. The more you desire to enter Shostakovich's miraculous world intimately, the greater will be your disappointment.

A mesmerizing, gorgeous Butterfly to watch! The actors' movements are stylized but never elaborately so, genuinely meaningful lighting and a stage concept that's spare beyond spare but intensely inviting. For me, one viewing wasnt sufficient, and a repeated look yielded even more reasons for affection for this production. This is one of a few non-traditional stagings of any opera that actually stands up and says something worthwhile. Butterfly is an opera where the score in its divine pungency tends to define everything. Despite the coruscating love story, it's Puccini's bona fide revolutionary score that leaves us shattered. What music! and Edo de Waart does a scrupulous job interpreting with the Amsterdam orchestra. Balances between singers and orchestra are always beautifully drawn. Cheryl Barker's singing is inconsistent but occasionally affecting, especially from the middle of Act 2 forward. Before she relaxes and warms, her singing exhibits a perceptible lack of trust in her instrument, causing her to keep from leaning fully against the singing action, a fault more of vocal technique than of artistic resolve. She seems to repair a lot of that as the piece progresses. There's an odd bit of momentary vocal barking in the scene with the Consul at the beginning of Act 2 that strikes me more as ill-chosen stylized vocal gesture than anything else. Tenor Martin Thompson is a fine Pinkerton - Addio fiorito asil is just about everything you could hope for. Catherine Keen is sumptuous as Suzuki - some standout singing there! The Humming Chorus is a visual meditation of steeply sad stillness, only Cio-Cio-San's son "Pain" dances upstage, away from the dread future to come. My dvd version offers a surround sound option in addition to stereo. Even if you're a traditionalist when it comes to Butterfly, there's a worthwhile adventure to be had in a film this beautifully conceived and delivered.

David Shipler's journalistic skills are enormous; the book is assembled nearly perfectly, with balance, insight, and compassion. I've read it through twice, and have never found another book that comes close in terms of presenting the truth of the Middle East conflict. For American readers, the greatest service this book offers is an uncompromisingly fair, even wise, portrayal of the Palestinian side of the conflict in this region, if only because of America's historically pro-Israel policies; policies, incidentally, which have not always concerned themselves with truth. Because of that act of journalistic justice, the peculiarly touching aspect of Israel's unavoidable internal sorrow at her predicament becomes, perhaps for the first time, something understandable and noble. It is an easy thing to take sides in a situation such as one finds in the Middle East; it is not so easy to patiently explore the myriad strands of time and fate that weave through both sides of such an 'unsolvable' conflict. This book goes a long way toward making an attempt to do just that. This is a clear-headed book 'spoken' by the very people involved; it is wise and engaging, and full of David Shipler's heart. It is no wonder that it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Highest recommendation!

Only Glenn Gould, with his effusion of rhapsodic gifts, could effectively create this beautifully austere recording! The application of his genius to these pre-Baroque gems leaves one thunderstruck! The most effective review is to simply implore: Buy This Recording! The choice of pieces is the key, and Gould's abundant mind is everywhere upon them - the Byrd is overflowing, the Gibbons is painted like a mediaeval town, and Sweelinck's Fastasia is at once Stokowskian in urgent intent and regal in repose. There is more than piano playing going on here; Gould rather impersonates this music, so liberated from all confines is the final result. Gould's vision is complete and unutterably right. A perfectly brilliant, absolutely essential recording of which you will never tire.

A groundbreaking recording! Gould's way with Hindemith amounts to love. HIs recording of the sonatas is beautiful, and profound. He finds even more by way of Das Marienleben, finely sung by Roxolana Roslak. Gould's inerrancy lets him reveal the score as much as composer as pianist. This is music making as vital as breathing. Gould's ardent, wondrous musicianship creates some unearthly effects in the final three poems - Vom Tode Mariae (On the death of Mary). In the first of the three, he makes the piano literally echo figments of orchestral instruments -an oboe, even strings- so deft is his touch and pervasive his understanding. God-like playing, visionary musical ideas upon a richly endowed score (Gould called it the greatest song cycle ever composed, and perhaps proves it), and an artistic collaboration with Roslak that begins attracted to greatness and grows from there - this is an astonishing reading of a great piece. Gould gives his mind to music so directly, his playing is utterly unencumbered by any strain of ego. It's his greatest strength as an artist, and one worth cherishing because truth is restorative. It is life-giving. What more can be said in praise of an art? Whatever this man plays becomes as pure and selfless as he is, and this 2-disc recording stands among his finest achievements. Absolute recommendation.

I concur with the review previous to this one! What a joy this recording! Hindemith's overlooked piano sonatas are given entrancing readings by the High Priest of the pianist's art, Glenn Gould. Surely no modern pianist's work is more moving than that of Gould. That perfectly configured sweetness of sound, always his very own, like an intelligent narcotic -whatever he plays! With the Hindemith, he's in his element, not only meeting all the requirements, but tossing them into the harmonious air page after page, shaping music that is so true to itself, it's scary! The Third Sonata in particular is a lesson in pianism, and in heart! What abandon! Gould always plays from the inside out, there are never any supurfluous thoughts to trim; it is as pure an art as you will encounter. And what marvelous pieces, these sonatas! Hindemith to this day remains under-appreciated, certainly under-played, although a number of recent recordings seem to be addressing this - and there is such a wealth of first-rate music from which to make a renaissance. Hindemith's music never disappoints, and consistently stirs up a heady response. To my mind, there is a discernable element of joy traceable in much of his music; despite the vicissitudes of a remarkable life, the creative flow not only never diminished, but indeed deepened- the quartets are all of a sound beauty, the magnificent Requiem, the essential pieces for solo instruments, all the 'useful' music, and these piano sonatas, perfect pieces in a remarkable panorama of musical delight here perfectly played.

This book reaps a marvelous harvest from a sparklingly original idea. Pelikan goes to the root source of Bach's genius, his faith. What results is a crop of new ideas not only of the grandeur of Bach's music and the interior impetus of creative genius itself, but as well a rich exploration of the authentic reaches of theology. The great Capellmeister lives anew in these pages in a way I've not encountered since Evening in the Palace of Reason. Pelikan's chapter on themes and variations in the Passions, and his meditation on human redemption in the St Matthew Passion, are together worth twice the price listed here. I've studied and played Bach all my life. Bach Among the Theologians has given an arresting freshness to a nearly sixty year passion! Recommended with great gratitude.

The music of Ben Britten always responds to the authentic musicianship of a singer, and Anthony Rolfe-Johnson delivers one of the great versions of Les Illuminations. A tremendous recording of a magnificent score. Rolfe-Johnson sings with majesty and intimacy throughout. An exacting but musical diction never intrudes, and Rolfe-Johnson's natural comprehension of this masterpiece surely comes under the heading of a gifted musical experience for any attentive listener. The London Mozart Players under Jane Glover submit heart and soul to Britten's tableau and let it stand shining in its perfections. This is music making of wisdom and heart, and the singing is exquisite. One can lament missing the almost mystical affirmation with which Peter Pears imbued every note of Britten's music he ever sang, and one does, but Rolfe-Johnson makes this score his own to enrich a great musical legacy.

Pema Chodron is a great teacher because she always positions herself firmly in place as a learner. This book of hers is no exception, and ends up rewarding both her message and her readers with simplicity, clarity, and profound usefulness. Pema's commentary on Shantideva's mystical poem The Way of the Boddhisattva is measured and fulfilling, and her visceral understanding of the majesty of bodhichitta is alive and free on every page. Leave it to a teacher of this depth and understanding to make an 8th century mystical treatise address with intense awareness the commonplace realities of daily life. There is so much wealth for the serious practictioner contained in this book, it's tough to single out individual segments for praise; but the long middle section on Patience is especially attentive, and often piercing to the point of sublime beauty, and the segments Using Our Intelligence and Taming the Mind are wisdom overflowing. Reading this book, one easily discerns the joy of sitting at the feet of this master at Gampo Abbey and finding oneself whole time and again. "May the blind receive their sight, and the deaf begin to hear ... May the naked now be clothed, and the hungry eat their fill." Thank you, Pema, for revealing to us the path of fearlessness and love. This is food for life. Supreme recommendation, no reservations. And the book has a beautiful little appendix with a study guide that turns out to be one of its most useful attributes!

Sokurov's work is always worth watching (Elegy of the Land, Russian Ark, and Spiritual Voices spring joyfully to mind), but of them all surely Alexandra stands a perfect work of collaborative genius. The great attraction for me was getting the gifts of Galina Vishnevskaya in the role of a lifetime. Her own life has been profounder than an opera role; &she's an actor of pungent means by an instinctive, interior passion rarely enough found. Her acuteness makes the camera itself but a vessel in the end. Her performance reveals a character by a kind of ecstatic stasis, detailed with subtleties impossible to catalog, and likely unforgettable. She creates with myriad near-psychic details, gestures, glances, aided by a consummately naked script, &the culminating effect lodges in mind and heart with real anguish. There's little to add to Ted Byrd's review; comments richly insightful. This is filmmaking we don't get from Hollywood; art made from suffering is the difference that defines. A brilliant anti-war film, yes, and more, in work this truthful, and beautiful, the war policies of American profiteers find a perfect antidote. It's a film experience cherishible, recommended with urgency.

Bishop de Mallerais' grand scale biography of Archbishop Lefebvre is a notably literate, well-researched, and beautifully intimate look at one of the most important religious figures of the 20th century. While generally ignored in so-called evangelical America, Lefebvre's spiritual legacy, in the once-Christian nations of Europe, has proven not only its accuracy of discernment, but the composite effect of its roots and flowering has arguably reached even to the unexpected election of Josef Ratszinger to the papacy. The official resuscitation of the Roman Mass, indeed, the now almost daily reawakening of the Roman liturgy in general, is positively a result of Lefebvre's spiritual acumen in a time of trial, but we might ask what is the vivifying kernel of that success. The life and work of Marcel Lefebvre answers: the truth of spiritual fidelity, indeed, the faithfulness of spiritual truth. In the end, standing virtually alone, Lefebvre affirmed that a thing which is cannot be called that which it is not. Having rushed to effectively devour itself during and following Vatican Council II, the Roman Church in the succeeding years has itself proven the truth of Lefebvre's affirmation, a fact probably as remarkable for what it illuminates as for what it condemns. This biography proves the positiveness of Lefebvre's actions, but no more forcefully than history itself. In that way, this book is a faithful transmission of the meaning of Lefebvre's life's work. Bishop de Mallerais' formidable finesse as a scholar and writer furnishes each chapter with details available from no other source. Especially welcomed is an appropriately generous study of the Archbishop's early family life, and his missionary activity in Africa - an aspect of Lefebvre's religious life that remains especially dear to those who have all along appreciated this churchman. Copiously detailed notes are included every step of the way, and a fine selection of photographs accompanies a genuinely effective, intelligent volume that consistently eschews hagiography, relying instead on the power of plain truth. I happened, the other day, to come across a press notice that brought to mind the very thing vividly expressive of the meaning of Msgr. Lefebvre's contribution: the 'Liturgy Chair' of the USCCB has frantically warned of his concern that Benedict XVI's recent decision to correct the universal mistranslation of "pro multis" in the Mass formula of Consecration would lead the faithful to doubt that Christ's sacrifice was sufficient to save all men! I reread the statement three times, making certain I hadnt blinked and misread. The conceit at the heart of that kind of manipulation stumbles and dies at the feet of Marcel Lefebvre. Let what they say, stand; let what you know, live. This is a beautiful book.

This film is a truly successful look at the life and career of Peggy Lee. First saw it on PBS, and noticed the beautiful intimacy and completeness. The intelligence and taste guiding the choices of footage, taken from some wonderful sources, left an impression. Repeated viewings have only confirmed my initial experience. Even the most knowing Peggy Lee admirer will be impressed by the loving tone of the film. More than a paean, it offers a genuinely convincing portrait of a wonderful musician. Lee was more than a singer; she really created a spanking new idea of a singing musician, writing much of her material, and overseeing impeccable arrangements that were way ahead of their time. Nothing's spared in making clear the tremendous influence her master musician husband Dave Barbour had in ultimately forming Peggy's musical understanding, distinguishing every nuance with the happy wonder of their personal connection. I appreciate that part so much. People nowadays think of Lee merely as a singer. A singer no doubt, greater than we know, but what lies underneath that effortless musical breeze is what makes her contribution to American music history something extraordinary. This DVD's got it all - first-rate performance clips, a ready thoughtfulness, style, and a similar element of the pleasure of inevitableness that characterizes Peggy Lee's music. One of the few filmed bio documents I've come across that extracts every ounce. Get it with confidence, especially if you're already a Peggy Lee fan.

Of the many excellent film documentaries of the art of Glenn Gould, this is my favorite. I've found it only in VHS format, it ought to be on DVD. Everything is here. Gould's sustaining family, his father, and especially his cousin Jessie Griegg contribute filmed remembrances of Glenn, his youth in particular. Griegg's loving ideas are around every corner of this film, contributing to an estimable portrait of Gould's inner musical life. The film's scope is impressive, including some marvelous footage of his tempestuous character inventions in full costume, loads of ineffable piano playing, even a vigorous rehearsal with Menuhin of Schoenberg's Violin Concerto, accompanied by their wild conversation. Gould singing and conducting Bach to a field of attentive cows, and an expansive look at his radio documentaries (especially his 'Idea of North') are indispensable! Highest recommendation amid a sea of worthy Gould video. Watch this film, your love will increase.

Marginalized by the predominently white culture into which it was introduced, this CD of authentic Native American chants nevertheless remains a remarkable musical document! American racism notwithstanding, the musical accomplishment found in 'Sacred Spirit' is probably one of the very reasons for its 'hiddenness!' Incorporating a modern aesthetic, but remaining clear about its roots, it is more than an historical odyssey; a journey through its eleven tracks takes up a spiritual path, delineating a whole culture effortlessly, displaying passages of tremendous beauty. Thankfully, this is no white man's look at Indian culture! The Pawnee soul-cry &quot;Our hearts are set in the heavens/It is there our hearts are set - in the heavens!&quot; pervades the noble aesthetic of the whole disc. The lullaby (Dawa -Cradlesong) so often mentioned is but one of eleven superbly realised pieces, the disc is easily and most profitably absorbed 'of a piece', the end of the disc comes much too soon; and marginalized though it may be by the overlords of pop culture, one takes a certain comfort in knowing that a portion of the proceeds of each CD sold goes to the Native American Rights Fund. This disc embodies a timeless witness of an authentic American music, not to mention an historical ethos of rich and compelling beauty! Get it!

I've not read another book as lovely as this one in a long time! The estimable daughter of Robert Graves creates in beautiful prose an estimable voice of her own, while wearing warm and honorable traces of her father's literary genius; there's a common clarity, and distinction in the language. There's remarkable writing on every page; the ever so gradual reaching deep into the heart of Franco almost by not mentioning him, the destruction of her Spain from within, the passion of her love for her Catalan self, among her many selves- it's a thoroughly important book in every way. The first and last sections work like bookends and are epsecially right; Graves' subtle reflections on her relationship with her mother. This is English prose of the first order. Of course, one has a natural penchant to want to find wonderful amber things in her writing, given one's regard for the work of her father; the interesting thing is that her own voice presents itself right off, so much so that one ends praising even more the virtue of the inheritance, rather than getting lost in the echos. Her reflections on the work of a translator are beautifully woven throughout the book, and reveal a meticulous care for the possibilities of language. The ways in which she chooses to speak of her father in this memoir are memorable; at the oddest, least unexpected moment the narrative will turn and there is Robert Graves, father. This really is an irrepleaceable work of art. I commend it to everyone to read, there is something for every reader in these slender pages, and that surely expresses the consummate perfection of its parts.

I don't share the criticisms about the editing of this dvd found in other reviews. La Nouba is surely one of the finest Cirque du Soleil shows and dvd captures issued so far. The living wheel segments are incredibly beautiful, and the trampoline act toward the end of the show will blow your mind! The finesse of the trampoline artists jumping onto and INTO buildings is spellbinding! It's off the mark to argue that a filmed presentation of a live show like La Nouba is not the same thing as being there; of course it isnt, and cannot be. But the cameras are consistently used with intelligence and artistic fire, and fully capture the essence of the live show. Once again, the musical score for La Nouba is scintillating and always beautiful, sampling jazz, Latin funk, European pop - original music of the highest quality. This troupe continues as one of the artistic wonders of the world. Dont miss this amazing dvd. It's a must have if you're a Cirque du Soleil fan, and the perfect way to become one if you've yet to experience these athlete artists. Unequivocally recommended - get this unforgettable dvd performance with confidence!

I've only had this set about a week and have already indulged three complete listenings; it's a gold mine! - the power of preaching is persuasive in the Temple of Horowitz! I'm taken aback by the unity and continuity of sonics, an excellent and remarkable display of high engineering art. Everything important is here (almost! I wish some of the Scriabin Preludes had been included). There are sketches of incomparable pianism and supreme intelligence in these discs: Liszt's 'Vallee d'Obermann', and the Consolations; Debussy's 'L'isle joyeux' - so 'russian playing french'! - Scriabin's 'Vers le flamme' and the Black Mass sonata - one simply can't climb out of the volcano, it's terrifying and beautiful! - and the Scarlatti and Chopin. Only Gilels approaches Horowitz's indigenous understanding of Chopin. In the course of thirteen discs the glory can start to crash in around you, but at the last moment of endurance along comes 'Serenade of the Doll', or one of the Consolations. The Bach-Busoni is cerebral and fine. Horowitz gets rapped for the wrong romanticism - it's the romanticism of artistic intelligence that his art claims! I love that famous C clunker at the beginning of the Bach-Busoni in the Return to Carnegie Hall recital; more than that, I appreciate how Horowitz played his public pride in it, no retouches, etc. Shrewd, and very real, I think. He was a pianist of enormous humility on the inside, so completely knowing of his gifts - one of the reason his playing was something special. He possessed the often disregarded ability to stand completely outside his playing and admire it as one might a beautiful woman, with complete humility. It affords us the privilege of reaping joy after joy of a remarkable art the likes of which will surely stand true for a long time. 200 bucks is a lot of money, I probably would have thought it too much for the convenience of a collection; I'm glad someone else didn't feel that way, and gave me the set! - now I find it curiously too clever a package to be considered merely a consolidation of recordings into a 'set' - there is something indefinably congruent about these recordings. They fit together with harmonious intent, and shine and shadow the land with a marvelous music. Highest recommendation without reservation.

The Stravinsky is a giant of a piece, and Cho-Liang Lin rocks! His playing is outrageously fine, constantly and completely. The nuances of his musical hearing are a wonder to behold time and time again! He claims the magisterial Stravinsky with all fires lit, and leaves the competition in the dark! It's as inevitable a performance as you will ever hear from a master of Music. The Prokofiev is so strong and beautiful, and the First Concerto, especially, so brilliantly composed, it's difficult to complain that we hardly need more Prokofiev concertos, so I won't. Lin's sheer musicianship is startling; his is an original and musicianly vision of kingly proportions, and so pure at times it takes your breath away. His magnificent musical aesthetic comes full circle between the Prokofiev and the Stravinsky, each advance coming rightfully from the one before, set in an extraordinary musical understanding that seems to know no boundaries but beauty in Cho-Liang Lin. And the fiddles he uses, especially the Guarneri del Gesu, are to my ear without peer among the instruments of the great modern violinists recording today! If you want to know HOW a great violinist 'hears', listen to the timbre of the instrument he chooses to play! This is a great recording - don't miss it!

I so agree with the last reviewer! As to another reviewer's dissertation on what constitues a &quot;Mozart singer&quot;, hogwash! Montserrat Caballe failing to understand at every moment that she is singing Mozart? Hogwash! A 'Mozart singer' is like every other 'singer' - you got it or you ain't; the rest is intellectual preening and has nothing to do with genuine operatic art. And what singing this is - a Cosi to treasure! Mozart's ensemble writing in this opera surpasses that of his other operas, and Baker, Cotrubas and Caballe find an emotional perfection in the rendering that alters the earth's orbit! I've not heard another Cosi like it since Cotrubas' earlier recording with von Stade and Stratas. I also have the Harmonia Mundi recording and find it mundane by comparison. Veronique Gens has fioriture up her sleeve; she can pull it out, but she sings with the emotional depth of a teenager. Hers is a vocal aesthetic for Lully or Rameau, but not Bach, and certainly Mozart suggests that more consolidation of resources is necessary. Why not hire David Bowie for the role? -might as well. What is more 'stylish' than the musicianship these peerless singers and musicians bring to this surpassing Cosi? Please not Rene Jacobs' arcane treatment of the score, though I do admire the Cologne orchestra, particularly the weight of the strings, but that too cerebral 'informed classicism' always sticks its little notebook up into the musical air. Colin Davis rivals his own Tosca (also with Caballe) in this recording. The Covent Garden forces shine under his watch, even more, they consistently reach into themselves and deep into Mozart, deep into the opera - an attribute I would not ordinarily ascribe to this opera orchestra and chorus. Nicolai Gedda will probably die still insufficiently revered, he is one of the supreme artists of our time, or any time; he is as desirable an actor as he is miraculous singer. Even now, as things fall apart, he remains the present heart of any opera ensemble. His artistry burnishes this recording to a glow. Get this recording - it really has no rival at present.

This set is worthy on three accounts- Carreras, Caballe and Colin Davis. For musicianship, Caballe outshines every other singer of this role! and we haven't even mentioned The Instrument yet! A singer who relies on a histrionic interpretation of Floria Tosca does so at peril of her believability in this role. I've always felt Tosca to be an operatic character with more layers than are found by most purveyors of the role, certainly Montserrat Caballe applies her inborn musical intelligence in all the right places, creating a rare and dimensional character, shunning the inevitable tiredness of a merely excitable Tosca, as is often the case. People will go on about Callas, her Tosca. I am too little convinced by Callas' theatrical overload, too often does it come arrayed as recompense for vocal instability, if not inadequacy. With Caballe, the opposite approach is utilised; the character comes as much from fidelity of and toward the singing as it does from applied manners of theatricality, and is therefore more rewarding to a very large degree. Carreras still sang wickedly well at this point, his &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; is a clamorous thing! The over-arching beauty of this recording comes from the hands of conductor Colin Davis. I've not heard a more sympathetic reading from any conductor- it really is splendid! Make no mistake, this is an aristocratic rendering from top to bottom, only to have the humanity of the two leading singers cinch the deal! It's a unique and wonderful mix, Colin's exacting modernity against all that profane richness. Ramey's Angelotti is a miniature jewel, a real star turn. The singing is just wonderfully musical. And while that's rarely found in an opera recording, it really is essential for any lasting operatic testament.

I would describe Dietrich von Hildebrand's books as pruning the orchard without intransigence. No integrist, von Hildebrand states the case for his considerable position with a confident intelligence and virtually no mud-slinging; in the intra-Catholic battles that rampage the landscape these days, that's no small feat! Von Hildebrand is first a philosopher, but he acquits himself as a theologian no less assuredly. His diagnoses of the ills that afflict the Roman Church in the modern age, with the possible exception of Michael Davies, are without peer, and are certainly born of profound scholarship. His language is firm and clear, and without conceit. 'Trojan Horse in the City of God' is his most consistently engaging work, especially in terms of identifying the nature and cause of the Church's affliction; when it comes to answers, von Hildebrand's choices may please or displease, but his argument is noble and more than reverent- it incorporates the most elemental aspects of human common sense, making it stronger than the sum of its parts. The mystery of the Church is more than a quagmire of infractions, a recompense of abject violations; the Aristotelian in von Hildebrand tends to spin from the center down, not out. The Thomism never runs dry. That, perhaps more than the argument itself, keeps his voice from resounding more than it does throughout this admirable book. Nevertheless an important read for anyone interested in the scholarship of the Counter-Reformation in the XXth century.

This is a great recording, thanks to Karajan and Leontyne Price! Herbert von Karajan surely displayed his discriminating musical aptitude in spotting the possibilities in Leontyne Price early on; HE is the maestro responsible for assembling from her gifts a great Mozart soprano, among other things. Their musical relationship was long and fruitful, and this Carmen bears out the lasting brilliance of that unique artistic fusion. Price is stupendous in this mezzo role: believable, fired up, and tonally, a singer 'just come into her own' - a perfect combination! Listening to her Butterfly and her Carmen, I can't help feeling that early Price is the very best Price we have. Karajan's opera sensibilities are in full sway- what majesty in his approach to the score's insistent fire! As to the other principals, Franco Corelli as Don Jose and Mirella Freni as Michaela - perhaps the less said the better. Corelli overstates the case as usual, though the singing is robust and technically accomplished, if not beautiful. For elegance in this tenor role, I've heard none finer (or more undervalued!) than Neil Shicoff, Jessye Norman's partner in her recorded-only version. In my view, Freni is just the most methodical singer, always has been; reliable but generic. She seems to manage barely a glance at her one important aria, and it's a shame since it's such a fine piece of writing. Under Karajan the Vienna Philharmonic partners both opera and singers magnificently; only Bernstein has managed to coax from this superb orchestra the magic that Karajan does, and that magic is generously arrayed here. If you love Bizet's opera, don't hesitate to get this version. You can't beat it!

Renee Fleming is certainly Everyone's Opera Singer - an interesting elevation in a culture without much interest in opera in general. Without doubt she's created a successful singing career, has a beautiful singing voice and plenty of technique, and maintains an admirable appreciation of the art of which she is a prized exponent.So I feel a little badly not liking this book much. True, she avoids gossip, is accessible (I'm not sure what that really means), sells a great many CD units (she's even helped recast the idea of 'crossover artist') AND writes well, with unexpectedly deft touches artfully sprinkled here and there. But for me, there's something bland and lacking in the book, in all the success, accessibility, and golden child praise universal. I find the same unfortunately characteristic of her musical art, when all is said and done. I hear a wonderfully displayed sound, a carefully construed art, yet feel very little. I heard Fleming remark (during a 60 Minutes interview) that "opera, after all, is basically screaming". An odd intimation for an opera singer to make, I thought. In this book, more evidence is at hand that Fleming's is an art not patient with profoundness. Not a crime, but it IS unpleasantly ironic, leaving a listener with few choices.The great sopranos of the 20th c. she does not surpass. How near she has come to their contribution is a question ill viewed in the light of so many of her passing views about music and opera found in this book. I read it through, and maybe my receptors are way off mark. Who am I to argue with the world? Her often repeated views on the importance of a perfect passagio are commendably argued. For me, ultimately, her art itself fares less well. I wanted to offer 3 stars, but couldn't bring myself to do it. An interesting enough book for those interested in singers.

Martha Argerich is a genius. Her recorded legacy bears that out, and probably this Rachmaninov is a high point of that legacy. She is more an impersonator of music than a player. That makes her a shamaness, and yet in that shaman self -the self that eats the piano like an voracious carnivore- one is strangely at times kept from her musical personality. I notice this in her Bach. I notice it perhaps less in this Rachmaninov, but then this is a concerto that issues a menu from which to quell every consuming appetite. I've never heard a Ravel G Major finer than Argerich's. Her recording of it with the Berlin is monumental, a giant. I love Rachmaninov's 3rd, it's his finest piano concerto, and this version is riveting and unrelenting, shake-your-teeth-out wild, architectural, and beautiful at times. I don't know if it's of true greatness. The interesting thing is that Argerich's musical personality is so authentically deep and her musical language so natural, it's incongruous how often it's difficult to find it inside her Rachmaninov. Sometimes, I miss the MUSIC. The Tchaikovsky is more toned, to my ears, but what a tired piece. Whatever Argerich plays, it's always worthy of deep listening. She's a very human instrument of the gods. See what you think.

My beautifully articulated 1937 Harper and Brothers Publishers (NY and London) hardbound edition is titled "I Visit the Soviets: The Provincial Lady Looks at Russia", and contains the stirring pen and charcoal drawings of Leo Manso, a colored version of which appears to make up the cover of this edition. Delafield's book on her experiences living in a Soviet commune and indeed traveling throughout much of Russia is a treat, no matter which edition you connect with. A smart, connected prose style amplifies some extraordinary scenes of Russia burgeoning even at the end of the first flush after the revolution. The shadowy presence of Stalin wanders obliquely menacing through the revealing prose of a very capable reporter, who to her credit takes her task seriously and scores with a novelist's discerning eye for vital detail. I've read the book a number of times. It has the same hypnotic power as 'Searching for Icons in Russia' - a brilliant picture of a specific, consuming experience told with power and surprise. Anyone interested in the subject will be rewarded with tremendous fortune encountering this one-of-a-kind document of extraordinary events.

This is my favorite Pema Chodron book! You can open its pages anywhere, any time, in any frame of mind, and receive wide benefit to mind and heart. It is spiritual teaching of the only useful kind, practical teaching deliberately intended not to implant, but rather to unsheathe what is already native, but hidden. Pema Chodron leaves one to oneself -the very best teaching!- and by the faintest strokes of wisdom, insight, and practiced sensibilities leaves one higher, deeper, and more able to live freely within oneself. I think she is an extraordinary teacher, in the very best tradition of Western Buddhist training. If Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia is fortunate indeed to be gifted with this extraordinary woman, likewise are we. It seems I open that amazing turquoise cover (a more illustrious blue than even the fine photo on this page indicates!) several times a week. It is a book one gratefully lives with. I have given it to friends, family, and even a few strangers! I recommend it with confidence, compassionate purpose, and indeed a great deal of joy.

Caballe considered this to be THE performance of her career, that blustery night in Orange, and while this recording doesn't offer the inestimable vantage of the filmed version, there is enough glory here to end any further idle speculation over naming the greatest interpreter of the role of Norma! More finely attuned than Sutherland's Norma (where Caballe sings Adalgisa), with transfixing work from Jon Vickers in the prime of his enormous gifts, this is the 'Norma' of the ages. There will certainly never be another like it! Caballe's 'Casta diva' is hung like the stars - singing so laden with a divine patience, pathos, and musical presence that one can scarcely breathe! Of all of Montserrat Caballe's recorded versions of this aria (and there are many), this is without question the most breathtakingly cultured in its beauty and profundity; it is exalted, and truly is one of the very few genuine masterpieces of recorded operatic art. The fioratura is spun down from the open sky, it had no precedent, and indeed for all time will surely have no echo. This is singing that Maria Callas, for all that her contribution shall remain, never even dreamed, as indeed Callas herself to the credit of her humility understood, sending to Caballe, as she did late in her life, the earrings she wore on stage during her own assumptions of the role. When shown the video performance of this recording, Maria Callas, in perfect Callas-esque understatement, merely remarked &quot;ah, but they have made her look too beautiful.&quot; But of course she knew that this performance was so very much more. Caballe doesn't sing, she incarnates. Throughout the whole of her performance, Montserrat Caballe is as inspired as are the fierce winds insistent. Veasey's Adalgisa comes at times as almost coarse simply because it must stand arrayed against the divine virtues of Caballe's Norma. Patane is always a perfect companion at the podium, though there are moments when the orchestra seems to fail the singing- rhythmic indiscretions mostly, of course outdoor performances tend more often than not to rupture cohesion along these lines. But these are insignificant quibblings. One must not even air them, I think, beside the majesty of Caballe's accomplishment. This recording is an ineffacable, ennobling, and overpowering human artistic achievment. It is impossible to adequately praise it.

Despite a less than perfect performance by the Elora Festival Singers and some dismaying choices in audio engineering, Vaughan Williams' otherworldly Mass in G survives intact. I'm convinced almost nothing could destroy this titanic masterpiece. It's simply Vaughan Williams' very finest work among a number of luminous scores (Serenade to Music and the Fifth Symphony come to mind). Why the musicians seem so lackluster here is a mystery, maybe an off day. The singing of the anthems is more attuned, as is, weirdly, the engineering; both elevate as the recording progresses. Besides the Mass, it's a miracle to find the brief and elegant "O Taste and See" (sung wonderfully here) and "Come Down, O Love Divine" - one of the greatest English hymns and especially moving for Vaughan Williams' father having been vicar of Down Ampney when his son was born. Highest recommendation is for the King's College Choir, Cambridge under Wilcox recording of the Mass, but this is a fine effort overall, one whose musicians would be better served by less erratic sound engineering.

The best aspect of this book is the success it makes of a startling rebuke of the common ignorant calumny that attends the history and legend of Marie-Antoinette. Brava to Vidal for that! Her writing urges an attractive calm that recommends, but there's preciousness sitting too many scenes, too many pages. Her history is good, but hagiography's intolerance of what may not lift high enough a legend of the interior lives of the King and Queen intrudes. Vidal's argument is forceful, if I'm not fully convinced. Her attachment to Marie-Antoinette, combined with attentive scholarship, is cogently in evidence on her blog Tea at Trianon. I stop often, it's impossible to fail to have a good time there. For me, this book too easily makes light weight where it might have borne witness, not that it fails to serve a wonderful purpose. Vidal justly settles, unabashed and in sophisticated terms, without falling prey to her opponent's deceit, the crafted web of lies and self-loathing that has grown mad pursuing the martyr-queen across history. I wish these solemn ideas a wide readership, but I'm an old man.

I've played this recording ONLY in my truck for 2 months. I now know it like my own hand. Caballe's life-long devotedness to refining her extraordinary gifts to the purest art marks every inch of it. Felicitous technical genius, an achingly Absolute Instrument of rare beauty--these really are but component parts. What makes Caballe's art unique is the pureness of her fidelity to it -- she seems to have incarnated simply TO SING, period - is there another way to express having experienced this artist's affair with destiny except to call it pure, free of affectation, free of calculation, free of artifice --free, living and pure. She's a rigorous musician -rare enough, but almost unheard of in a singer. She makes rhythm, attention and assurance relevant, she can't help it! Her art LIVES in the subtlest nuances -lightening her voice so one SEES her lifting it at the end of 'Io son l'umile ancella' - turning an I Vespri Siciliani aria into a XXIst century-sounding creation with fioriture effects Berio could sign on to - the infinte patience with which she upholds 'D'amor sull'ali rosee' - and on and on. If you know Caballe's art, you'll love this recording. What can disappoint when one is immediately and inextricably linked to the Pure Infinite? If you've never heard this woman sing, you need to fix that right now.

Hilary Hahn comes not only as genius, she's a kind of scholar of the violin; precocious and impeccably able. The sound of her fiddle is indeed something worth pursuing. The instrument she uses here is made by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, Paris 1864. Sumptuous sound, and a performance choice made with characteristic elan. I agree with the reviewers who've noted well the atmospherics of this violin. That said, the Bach is fast and scarcely shapely. It's interesting to me that while Hahn is young enough to dare to drive the dance out of Bach, she remains at the same time abundantly musical in all things but tempi. That draws me up short, enough so I'm willing to cede her a true praise and respect even for a recording this unnecessarily tempermental. The protean energy of Bach lies deep within the comely shape of his music; artifice of tempo can neither disguise that forming energy nor supplant it. I long for Hahn to completely find this inner truth of music. But - I'm 57 and if I know music well, perhaps too well sometimes. It's enough to hear wondrous playing like this even in the face of perhaps some musical diminishment, and I say only perhaps. Hahn brings a quite sophisticated joy to music making, and youth and courage, and not a little scholarship - it's a marvel. What's to criticize? I'll listen many times to this Bach, and pray the inordinate sheen never wears away. An extra star for that incredible Vuillaume brings it to 4stars!

A magnificent score by Hans Werner Henze, and a mesmerizing production of it. The ingenious stage design is narcotic: '50s deco-inspired, lean-and-gleam Hopperesque economy treated with gorgeous colors, displaying an intimate relationship to the score itself. Henze's atmospheric colors are embodied in stage and set design, even in the subtly charged costuming. A decayed eroticism lurks, suggests, but never shows its full face. The piece progresses to warm deep colors as if by sadness. I find in Henze's wondrous scores an heir more of Stravinsky than Schoenberg. His unique fusion of serialism and tonality finds new ground in Boulevard Solitude. The singers are excellent. An heroic job by Swedish tenor Par Lindskog as Armand, his sturdy musicianship and beautifully polished tone never flag. Laura Aikin, a great Lulu in European houses, sings Manon wrenchingly, with seductive pianissimos and a terrific sense of the stage. Henze plies their relationship with erotic and terrifying music, and beautiful silences. Like Stravinsky, Henze's every musical gesture is scrupulously orchestrated to make dazzling musical beauty. Manon's character ends unsorry, and Henze gives her much of his amazing diaphanous music. His scores are never cloying or dismissive; attuned to theatricality like an alchemist, Henze's art is intense, profound and moving. Big recommendation for a really fine night at the theatre. The 80 year old composer, present for the performance, is cheered effusively at the end by a thrilled Liceu Theatre audience in Barcelona. You won't be disappointed.

This excellent book on the life story of Bishop de Castro Mayer is as well the telling of the woeful catastrophe of the Roman Catholic Church throughout the last forty years. The prelate who stood with Archbishop Lefebvre at Econe to consecrate four new bishops is shown here as Lefebvre's intellectual and spiritual equal - high attainment indeed. The lives of these two men with differing backgrounds, differing temperaments and rich with differing circumstances, in the end reveal the same inescapably onerous story of the Church that devoured itself, cannabalising its various parts in a record spate of only ten years of incomprehensible flight from reality, leaving in its rapacious wake a skeletal heap of lies and spiritual betrayal. Bishop de Castro Mayer's formal association with Lefebvre takes up but a small part of the story, yet the deathly shadow of the root cause of their eventual union hovers over every page. While aspects of the book tend faintly toward hagiography, the author for the most part keeps his attention in check, tracing the early life and especially the ordinary diocesan life of Campos, revealing de Castro Mayer's foresight of what was to come in the wake of Rome's apostasy, and the means by which he prepared the people under his spiritual care for it. It's a cautionary tale told perhaps too late to awaken the Catholic world, but important nonetheless for revealing the wisdom of men who refused the treachery of the Roman authorities at every turn. The writing style of the author is banal but sufficiently effective to nourish and maintain interest through to the end. It is, ultimately, a quiet book about simple things, and simple things and quiet turns have a way of entering and illuminating those mysteries which are often obscured by presumptuous flourishes and philosophies.

In fifty years, I've never encountered another work like these four volumes. The arresting aspect of Mary of Agreda's work is its utter universality. This 17th c. Franciscan nun writes as an historian, not a visionary. She uses the profound tools (and we find we never knew how profound they were!) of earth and language to construct in the reader the essence of a divine state. It could be called alchemy but for its innocence. From beginning to end, Mystical City embodies otherworldliness with majestic earthiness. Readily human, fully Franciscan, obedient, jubilant, and thus a target bullseye to the Spanish Inquisitors - Mary of Agreda's experiences forge in the crucible of daily religious life as if by design, and from it arises a fire of spiritual treasure. Mystical City of God is profoundly scriptural, prefiguring the spirit of Way of A Pilgrim. A constant theological exegesis sits peaceably with ecstasy, with no rupture. This book casts new light on the meaning of time, of interior attention, and struggle; every man seeking the Ineffable, no matter creed, will find here a surfeit of illumination. Every page is both familiar and unheard of. I've read the work through four times, and volume III (Transfixion) five. The Passion passages are like reading an illuminated manuscript, breathtaking in scope and detail; a brutal, surgical finding of life and death that I'm convinced is unlike anything else ever written. The one-volume abridgment serves a purpose, but the four volume work is irreplacable. Also, a new, promising full length bio of Mary of Agreda, written by scholar Marilyn H. Fedewa (Americans for Agreda), is coming in Spring/Summer 2006. Note: difficult prices are listed here - I read on the internet that a new edition of four volumes is being printed, available I believe in May 2006 for $100. But even at twice the asking price, with sweet irony money's scourge is made to pay for liberation. Mystical City of God sits as spiritual literature apart. Consider a book nothing less than the aggregate of human experience as heaven's manifesto. Reading it changes everything after.

This book is a royal dud. Unbearably tedious accumulation of detail and a vicious treatment of Catherine de Medici mark this as an unworthy book of history. It's a surprising disappointment in that Princess Michael of Kent has generally seemed one of the more intellectually solid members of the British royal family. The pages are laden with imperial minutiae to the point of distraction, serving only to interrupt the telling of the beguiling tale of Henri II and the contest between his wife and mistress. When the author gets distracted you can bet so does the reader, and it happens over and over again. The author's writing style has no simplicity about it when simplicity is the very tool needed to bring sympathy, and with it a genuine understanding of the history it seeks to reveal. Catherine de Medici has rarely been treated so forlornly, yet the fascinated affection lavished on Diane de Poitiers in the end makes a shallow mess of her story. The book desperately needs an unflinching editor, and the author needs a new direction and maybe a change of heart. This is more fairytale land than it is a presentable history.

Besides offering a thorough exposition of Mahayana belief, and indeed practice, with an anything but common traversal of the Four Noble Truths by a master, in these four videos one is invited to spend a few intimate hours in the presence of the Dalai Lama, always an ennobling experience. The camera work in this film is especially fine, making of the camera one's own eyes, as it were, and lifting the hours even lighter than they already seem. With respect to another of the reviews on this page, I found the necessary translation from the stage handled superbly, and clearly with a great deal of thought and natural reverence. In Thubten Jimpa, the Dalai Lama employs a beautifully adept translator, an interpreter not only brilliantly attuned to the words and thoughts of the Dalai Lama, but one so obviously loved by him, and who responds with a special kind of faithfulness, that a marvelous duet is often played out, only enhancing thereby this great teacher's magisterial presentation. I would add that one feels as well the 'Englishness' of the audience, so eager to quietly offer their accepting energy, so ready to listen, far more so than might be a gathering of Americans usually so conscious of themselves in the moment. The humor that ripples often between the Dalai Lama and his listeners throughout the evening is so generous and unaffected, one is returned again and again to the meaning behind the words, the experience behind the event. This is a film of the highest achievment, fortunately within the reach of us all. An unforgettable few hours!

Repeated listenings to this version of the All-Night Vigil have brought me around to a fair appreciation of its virtues. The pianissimos, especially fervent in the Rejoice, O Virgin movement, are truly moving. At a TT: 1 hr, it's a moderately paced, beautifully sung rendition of an immortal score. Oddly, the first two or three movements seem remotely inconclusive, but from the Nunc dimittus on, the choir catches fire and sings with superb conviction and musical purpose. The soloists, notably mezzo Olga Berusene, contribute handsomely to a devotional sound world that truly rises to the occasion of this sacred work. While not matching the ineffable singing of Konstantin Ognevoi (USSR Chorus version) or even Karl Dent (Shaw version), tenor Yuri Korinnyk sings the Nyne Optushchayeshi with great heart and a beautiful voice, consistently balanced within the full chorale. The Ukraine Choir possesses a genuine Slavic sound, served well by perfect acoustics. Admirably, the liturgical texts are included in full, but no other facts of choir, conductor, recording location, etc. are noted in the accompanying notes, although Amazon notes that it was recorded in Kiev Cathedral. This is easily one of the better recordings of this piece available, better than a number of Russian versions extant. Definitely worth a hearing, and offered here at a great price. Recommended.

Easily one of the top five finest albums of the last ten years! EVERYTHING on this cd is cream! Show me another track as original, riveting and subtle as 'Make me wanna holler'! Marvin, you're listening, aren't you?! Here is the MEANING of genius. I agree with another of the reviewers who makes mention of &quot;so many hidden things&quot; layered into this woman's music; Ndegeocello, in finding her own self, really has created a new genre within popular music, one that transcends category. Her attention to musical detail is astonishing, without hint of self-importance, no taint of self-congratulation - the rewards of this kind of music making are inestimable. The purity of human spirit embedded in art of this magnitude is something so admirable. A finished work of the highest reaches - period! Get it - you'll have purchased part of yourself!

Lama Ole Nydahl is a unique figure in modern Buddhist history -first Western student of the Black Hat lama, H.H. the XVIth Gyalwa Karmapa, married, lama 'without robes', and spiritual figure personally chosen by the Karmapa to teach and make foundations in his name- and 'Riding the Tiger' is filled to overflowing with his particular energies and gifts. It is a galloping book that takes the reader around the world, inviting him in for a close-up look at the making of a Buddhist center for meditation and study, and Lama Ole has successfully started over one hundred such centers. And a deep look, as well, at the nature of Buddhism in the West, how it has been transplanted, how it has flourished. With due respect to another of the reviews on this page, Lama Ole's defense of Diamond Way Buddhism and of the singular wishes of the XVIth Karmapa, and his willingness to discuss the schism that has taken place within the Kagyu tradition, with two reincarnations of the Karmapa presently recognized by two differing factions, is certainly not childish, nor does the conflict itself necessarily reflect negatively on the Kagyu lineage. It is to Lama Ole's credit that while focusing his attention on the spreading of the Dharma, he does not shy away from the controversy. Perhaps that is because he holds the truth of this historical situation in his mind and heart, and therefore need not fear the light of day when looking at this controversy. It is certainly interesting that the 'other' 17th Karmapa, the one 'recognized' by Beijing, has recently escaped over the mountains to Dharamsala! Did not the Lord Buddha say &quot;I show you suffering and the ending of suffering?&quot; This is a magical book and a magical ride!

This CD is disappointing, the Fifteenth vegetates in the hands of Haitink, but the disc is redeemed considerably by the singing of Elisabeth Soderstrom in the Jewish Folk Poetry cycle. Part of the blame for this lifeless version of the symphony must be slapped on the London Philharmonic Orchestra- there's just nothing exciting about this orchestra! Homogenous Haitink feels rather flatter than usual, and at least in this disc has similar company with the LPO. I like Haitink's opera work considerably, but he should stay away from Shostakovich's symphonies. Apparently he can't, he keeps churning them out. Am I the only person who feels that his Shostakovich just isn't raw enough, human enough? The orchestral cycle fares better, the ensemble singing is well glued, if a little laconic. It's a marvelous piece of music which Shostakovich wrote and withheld until after the death of Stalin. Soderstrom's affinity for Shostakovich's music is genuine, she does a big, round job of it- and the Concertegebouw shimmers at times. I'll be interested to hear the Turovsky version being released in September. If you're looking for a more engaged version of the song cycle, I'd wait til then.

So enticing is Vidal's cruel wind that a beautiful, rapacious genius lights each of these interviews. Gore Vidal is a reflector, our mirror. Looking, we see truth, as we see ourselves. Such is his charism; his accomplishment is our unaccustomed vigor at discovering the man in the mirror. There's a spacious lot of vintage Vidal here, but more - the Larry Kramer interview is haunting. The interviewers are uniformly a fine match, and everywhere Gore reigns! The end piece with Amy Goodman getting down deep. I'm sorry the book ended. It's a remarkable set of pieces, the most pleasing I've read in a long while. Big recommendation.

Henry Louis Gates' laudable publishing effort 'African-American Women Writers 1910-1940' series, a kind of chronological sequel to the celebrated Schomburg Nineteenth Century Black Women series, comes up with a winning piece of work by Elizabeth Laura Adams; 'Dark Symphony' details Adams' conversion to Catholicism beginning just after the Depression. The character of this book is marvelous, warm and wonderful, and seems perfectly fitted to the story it relates. There are some remarkable moments, for example, the description of Adams' desire for the confessional because of its anonymity -&quot;so no one could see I was black!&quot;- indeed, there are a number of moments that leave one suspended in a kind of new truth, so remarkably adept is the prose. The work is scrupulously, lovingly edited by Carla Kaplan, a recent recipient of a fellowship at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and herself an author. Many of Adams' poems are included as well, including the ubiquitous 'The Last Supper', and two differing versions of her best-known 'The Consecrated.' I hope this series of books is reaching the junior highs and high schools; works like 'Dark Symphony' deserve to be read, and read abundantly, by those whose minds and hearts will be shaping the world we're working toward. Highest recommendation for a genuinely surprising work of literature, and teller of our common history.

Whatever the truth is about Jetsunma Ahkoen, this is a splendid book. Martha Sherrill's take, occasionally more Sherrill than Jetsunma, is provocative and intense. As a reader, the book was hard to put down; as a practitioner, I'd recommend careful consideration before condemning Jetsunma Ahkoen Lhamo as inauthentic. Magic is one of the signal elements of Tibetan Buddhism, more so than most westerners can comprehend, and there are fascinating if not wholly revealing elements to the story of this female lama, an intricate person of unabashed contradiction, that are redolent of authentic Tibetan mysticism. In desiring to dismiss Jetsunma as huckster or mere cult mistress, one must confront the formidable essence of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, whose recognition confirmed her as the first American tulku. One must as well confront the teaching of Jetsunma herself, teaching that is less New Age than new form; power cadenced with humility and sparked with the particular vibrancy of Tibetan Buddhism. One cannot read the story of this woman's transformation and sudden full bloom with western eyes alone; the west will die by the old paradigm even while proclaiming liberation. Where we are young in our insight, Jetsunma Ahkoen often has stars for eyes. With respect to another reviewer, Tibetan Buddhism IS full of cults and crazy lamas; such is part of its inheritance and its power. It's not extravagance, or even a mistake, that can give Tibetan Buddhism 'a bad name,' but rather a reduction of its holistic nature to a catalog of misplaced western notions of spirituality that can,and will inexorably, make it founder. A being like Jetsunma is an anti-dote to this downslide, and thus one that is, not surprisingly, a sign of contradiction. The author's ability to 'read between the lines' is occasionally inferior to her literary gifts, which are considerable. Many are off-put by the Beverly Hills glow revealed in places in this book, a glowing perhaps conditioned less by the teaching of Jetsunma Ahkoen than by her enthralled detractors. I suspect a wider and wiser appreciation of this woman and her work will eventually be needed. But there's magic everywhere, as alive and inexorable as Buddha Mind in the pages of this joyous book! You want a taste of religion as the fever stone of love? read 'The Buddha of Brooklyn.' 5 ecstatic, foretelling stars!

For my money this is the finest filmed Turandot available and easily one of, if not the, best singing performances Eva Marton ever committed, in or out of this role. Hal Prince and maestro Maazel are on form in Vienna; a beautifully fluid stasis to the stage design lets the music reign, and Marton and Carerras make the most of it. Marton's singing in the Riddle scene is just hair-raising! Her first "Straniero!..." is like hearing God! I keenly prefer this Turandot to the 1987 Met film. Marton may or may not have by then accessed a greater understanding of the role, but the voice in '87 is inferior to what we find here; singing began to cost increasingly for her by that time. Carerras leaves little for Domingo to improve on. Carerras sings Calaf unforgettably in the recorded version with Caballe and reaches for that here, with some lost lustre, but the singing remains first rate. Waldemar Kmentt an exquisitely spectral Son of Heaven, his singing is a pungent manifestation of the heart of this opera. It's an astonishing rendition. The look of this Turandot is strong and sleek without unbuttoned modernism, which ennobles both stage and story; the Vienna orchestra play as they play only for Maazel. It could be argued in an appealing way that Maazel's concentrate of intellectualist musicianship serves rather to pull Puccini beyond itself by diving straight to the vigorous, accomplished core missed by lesser conductors. You won't regret owning THIS Turandot. Slow to appear on dvd, who knows how long it might be available? Mine is an older VHS version.

Fr Seraphim Rose has an intriguing history. As a gifted young seeker he imbibed enough Buddhism to aptly consider Alan Watts a purveyor of "armchair Buddhism," moved on to Orthodoxy & holy orders, then with one other monk founded a desolate skete above Redding, California, and became an influential voice in RCOR Orthodoxy. Of the three books of his I've read, this is the most radical and least coherent. Once started his books are hard to put down, but along the way you cant help thinking you really should. Because all along the watchtower, Fr Seraphim is weeping.. he says Orthodoxy is the only religion of the future, and he gives his reasons, but his worldview, &the philosophic elements of his argument are full of a confusion of their own: God as Smiter/Saviour, Man as wretch and ancient target of God's love, all the consuming oldies. Fr Rose works hard to prove redemption, but ends merely by sealing all the doors and windows, as if to end the paradox. The religion that's winged him is ancient and rigorous, he drinks its literal beauty and misses its spiritual Origin, and therefore preaches a tired apocalypse. It's been said Orthodoxy is slowly suffocating on a beauty that will never die.. Rose unfortunately submits a servicable intellect to chokehold ideas that read and feel like an underground missive, so secret and devastating is the truth. The desolation -but not the hope!- of the catacombs courses this book like a bad wind, &counseling like this only feeds the literalists' refusal to lift their heads. Rose transgresses truth by weighing ideas already eclipsed. Dont waste your time. His `Little Russian Philokalia' is a better book, but the author remains a man who fell too far.

Robinson's is a useful popular biography of Prokofiev that is better researched and better written than any other English language bio of the great composer. Equal measure is given to Prokofiev's time in the West, and to his life after returning to Russia. There's much that's interesting here - a persistent exploration of Prokofiev's quixotic relationship with Diaghilev, generous delving into the composer's personal life, including especially some revealing passages on the almost uncharacteristic affection Prokofiev lavished on his children, and a resonant view of his work habits. Prokofiev's career disappointments were many, some even tragic, and the author doesnt beat around the bush, but the admirable thread of fierce devotion maintained by Prokofiev toward his own unquenchable musical purpose is thoughtfully argued by Robinson throughout the book, indeed it's one its strengths. The author even notes details of some of Prokofiev's foppish Parisian clothing that helped start him off on the wrong foot on his return to Russia. There are a number of subtle moments like that where one can discern the winning hand of a committed biographer. The importance of Prokofiev's canon of works is denied a hearing for the most part, but the book suffers little for that. The useful appendices include a chronology and a catalogue (by genre) of the composer's works, in addition to a healthy bibliography. I recommend this book for anyone just taking up the subject of Prokofiev. Listening again to the seventh Piano Sonata would perhaps serve more succinctly for the already initiated.

There are so many fine versions of Rachmaninov's All-Night Vigil available, one can afford to be particular in appreciation. Karen P. Thomas' Seattle Pro Musica delivers a finely manicured and wonderfully able version issued on its own label. The treble voices are especially pure, and the basses possess for the most part the necessary heft and depth, but the approach to the score sometimes strikes me as lacking dimension. I always consider the singing of the Nunc dimittus the guiding benchmark of any version of this piece, and tenor Stuart Lutzenhiser, whatever his nationality, offers a beautiful tenor solo. For all the authentic emotional color manifested, the choir, Mr. Lutzenhiser included, ultimately seems not to escape a fetching American sound, and in the end the Slavic heart of the score can seem more cultivated than compelling. But importantly, the musicianship is first rate, the pianissimos are exquisitely realized, and among the 'quicker' versions (56:47) available, especially from non-Russian choirs, this is a beautiful effort worthy of repeated listenings. Should Seattle Pro Musica read this review, I suggest to them a look at Shvedov's Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. I suspect they could work manifest wonders there.

I agree this is one of the best concert films around. Horowitz is in fine form, and his playing is fittingly masterful. His Scarlatti's the sparkling best moment in the program; the Mozart won't be for everybody, although I never get why that is, if you Listen. Horowitz chooses smaller, personal pieces, fending off autumnal aspects with characteristic elan, but clearly a man profoundly moved by playing once again in Russia. This is the Russian charism, always returning; Horowitz embodies it body and soul in this film. A brilliant energy of Reunion blasts every frame and ends a cut above the ordinary concert document. In the Russian way, in the end, what's left unsaid makes the profoundest sound. Horowitz isn't a pianist for everybody; he was annoying as hell at times, even when pointing a way deep into music. He foiled himself time and again as an artist; but then, who's to say. There remain lessons of humanity in his art; if more is asked, nothing more can be expected of an artist. This most ardent Horowitz film is in a class by itself. Proceed without fear.

This is John Snelling's major work - he was putting the finishing touches on it when he died in 1992! - and tells the fascinating story of Agvan Dorzhiev, brilliant Mongolian lama and Lhasa's emmisary to Russia in the 19th century. Arrayed against the backdrop of the fiercely Orthodox court of the Tsars with its sacred religio-political dominance over nearly every aspect of Russian life, the extraordinary progress made by Dorzhiev in setting Tibetan Buddhism on a solid footing in that land is a story of remarkable courage and success. I always find Snelling's books a bit dry, if not strictly academic, but the scholarship shines, and the text is sure-footed and informative. The kernal of the book's success lies in its thoroughness, and Snelling takes a comprehensive look as well at the post-Communist situation of Buddhism in Russia, and indeed makes a valuable contribution even in his speculative stance with respect to its future. Included are some marvelous photos of Dorzhiev, and a brilliant mini-history of the Buryats (from which Dorzhiev arose) is wonderful. Though quite readable, I would say this is definitely a specialist's book; more than a biography - certainly not hagiography! - it concerns itself with the what is, rather than the what if. In any case, it's a tale unlikely to be found told anywhere else, and doubtless not with as much authority, if not passion, or with as carefully a wrought scrutiny as Snelling's. Recommended for those inclined toward the myriad aspects of Buddhist history.

Scorned by religious literalists and always misappropriated by mindless innovators, Merton truly is the most Catholic man, the most ardent Monk, and The Inner Experience his subtlest and deepest book. In a towering 150 pages, an intellectual presence vast and keen enough to subserve an inexhaustible faith is at work renewing Christian thought, opening doors and finding the authentic where reigned before naught but numinous habit. The middle chapters on John of the Cross' doctrines of darkness and acceptance are surely among the finest in all of Merton's work. Page after page, as our understanding increases Merton's concerns expand, but the experience never spirals out of reach, instead moving deeper and firmer. His interior grasp of buddhist concepts and an original and invigorating line of Zen thought pursue the book like a consuming fire, in the end making of Merton's Christian wisdom something divinised and freely given. Thirty some years after his death, he can only be called an inextinguishable thinker and one of the most remarkable writers of any age. Ten years in the writing, Inner Experience is meticulously and generously edited by William Shannon. If you want to know what Merton can give you, human reader, pick up this book. Not a recommendation alone, more an insistence. Don't walk by.

This is the biography of Pike that we've been waiting for. Robertson's achievment is awesome and this book is marvelous. Pike's many difficulties -alcoholism, ambition, theological posturing, difficulties in his family, with his women- are finally choreographed into the submissive background where they belong, as the three-dimensional Pike emerges broken and whole - a man addicted to action. Believing, warring, loving, campaigning, preaching, living and dying - Pike sat astride the rhythm of unrelenting action, for good or ill. Those who look to the inconsistencies in James Pike to find the living parts are looking too far. His great personal truth was in his every action- wild and true, beautiful, violent. Passionate Pilgrim brings it all before us. David Robertson's intelligence arrives with a stash of new ideas and insights, a scathing sympathy for his subject, and the ear of a real writer. Anyone interested in Pike's story will be mesmerized by this book that demonstrates better than any other I can think of the ecstatic dimensions of biography that can be achieved by perfect prose.

I became interested in this book after listening to the author speak on BookTV, finding in his remarks and demeanor an important antidote to the jingoistic proselytizing that apparently passes for religious thought in America these days. Harris is a natural writer and an important thinker, there's no mistaking that. There is no fumbling in the pages of this book, no cheap shots, a mesmerizing intellectual sincerity and a passel of original ideas the author fuses into an engaging whole in clean, clear prose. His thoroughgoing dissection of the violent fundament inherent in the creeds of Islam and Christianity, in particular, never wavers from his central theme - these religions' requirement of belief based on insufficient evidence. So far, so good, I would say, though it is interesting that Harris' forte being philosophy, not science strictly speaking, would seem to indicate a possibility that the idea of 'evidence' might be made more pliant and less exclusive than the author allows in this book.Harris' arguments from a socio-political perspective are well reasoned and welcomed. No right thinking person wants a Tom Delay account of things passing for either religion or politics. An unfortunate aspect of Harris' assertions is an unrelenting insistence on defining faith strictly as faith IN - creed, gospel, scripture, tradition - and ignoring the more fluid and indeed more exacting meaning of faith; its accepted meaning, yes, but also what it might be, what it can be. This seems to me a more important idea to examine, in contradistinction to merely assuming a kind of atheism - an idea with no escape since it instantly takes up arms against the very thing it claims not to exist. The book's title and subtitle would still serve well even if one were to find a larger canvas inside its pages.My other criticism of the book is its inescapable negligence in providing a comparable dissection of Zionism. Harris himself makes the apt point that most if not all of the isms in the world are but religion substitutes - communism, consumerism, environmentalism, etc. Zionism, with its history of racism and violence, does not occasion an extensive inclusion in his cogent analyses of the need for an end of faith? Despite a few sprinkled sentences devoted to castigating the God of Israel in relation to his main theses, I ended the book feeling as if a chapter had been overtly left out.These criticisms notwithstanding, I recommend the book without hesitation. Sam Harris has opened important new ways of looking at the interaction of religion and societies. One must be grateful for this, especially in a society virtually uprooted at present by nefarious politics of intimidation and by an ever-morphing array of cultic religious sects the standards of which make mediaeval machinations seem mere closeted fantasies, not to mention the flagrant fusing of the two at the highest reaches of civil government - a state we are precariously living through even as I write this.

Don't be afraid of this big-boned bio of Marie Antoinette, it has everything you need. It's elegantly paced and beautifully construed. Fraser's work is just the best. She knows when to leave a topic, when to move on. HOW to move on. This is first rate writing from a consistently fine writer. The book is sypathetic toward Marie Antoinette, on occasion even moving; Fraser illuminates from the inside out with her subjects, and we're the winners for that. The book's full of marvelous detail about court life, yet seen through new eyes, perhaps Marie Antoinette's eyes. Fraser lingers on the Queen's Austrian life before Versailles long enough to lead us to new lights about this woman's suffering on account of her extraordinary temperment. It's an altogether admirable effort. If the book seems light on Fersen, look again. His place in Marie Antoinette's life undulates through the narrative like a slow fire. This is one of the few authoritative books about Marie Antoinette that truly witnesses the mystery. Pre-Revolutionary France bleeds through the pages. Fraser writes like an entranced surgeon; her preparation, her immaculate discernment of good sources is unmatched. An essential book about astonishing things.

In a word, this is the finest recording of the Sonatas and Partitas extant. The recorded sound is dismal having been taken from older sources, miserable, in fact. That misfortune noted, the intelligence of this remarkable musician obliterates every distraction; intelligence like glass, so clear and revealing is it at all times, so native, so fervently humble and thus naturally devout. I don't believe there has been, at least in the modern age, another musician of such fecund gifts as Yehudi Menuhin. What an astonishing crystalisation of vast plateaus of understanding in this man! He is a mountain, and his Bach is a natural force capable of saving the world. This is not the only recording of this Bach that I listen to. There are days when all I want is Oscar Shumsky- a fountain of beautiful Bach art at every turn, so full and final. The other contender is of course Milstein, wise architect with all the clear warmth. But in the end, Menuhin pushes the world into his Bach, not the other way round. I believe it is his most remarkable musical achievment, and there have been many. If you want to hear the Sonatas, and perhaps especially the Partitas, from the vantage of Sebastian Bach, and if you have a need to understand what is art, get this recording.

A supreme Traviata, no question about it. Sutherland's singing remakes the role of Violetta, rescues it from excess, makes it upright. Her singing is about the exposition of a beautiful voice and the art made from it - in this case, a high flying execution of the wiles of rare singing genius. Marvelous to know. In contrast to the artifice of drama, she makes the SINGING art once again seriously essential. Other roles suit aspects of her singing better than Violetta, but make no mistake she owns everything in this recording. Carlo Bergonzi's Alfredo is a template of why his is a voice impossible to hear too often, its unforgettable strong rosy hue imbues every line. His musicianship gives everything vital to a kind of singing I swear no present day chap comes near. A free, classical seriousness gives wondrous lights to Bergonzi's consistently intelligent singing. The chorus is notably fine, sharp and clean, and beautifully recorded, and Pritchard's on his game throughout - on fire in Act I, I'd say. The audio quality here is something special, unlike a recent number of over miked efforts that spoil integrity and enjoyment. The sensitive and natural recorded sound here really enhances the drama of the musical experience. Bergonzi's 'Un de felice' is pure sunlight on a bottle of eternal Italian wine. Even through the fin de siecle opulence of three legendary voices at their natural highs, I'm amazed at the profound musical attractions here. If you love Traviata, do yourself a favor and get the complete recording. Highlights discs are cool but believe me you want to ride the whole river through the rapids. Recommending the best.

A manifestly brilliant piece of historico-devotional literature, in this, the second book of his trilogy on absolute power, Polish scholar Kapuscinski is relentless in his 'interviews'! Updike's on the money, the book is hewn poetic to the point of a palpable tenderness, with language that is almost voluptuous in its lurid candor. And such sorrow, the pages can hardly hold it! As an allegory of communism, the author weaves universal tales out of the remarkable story of Haile Selassie and his Ethiopia. The book has a hypnotic, narcotic kind of ardor, very personal, yet strangely and beautifully universal. It's not only possible, but nearly guaranteed, that in these pages one can gaze upon a kind of hero-martyr the likes of which are rare enough, but nearly obscure in modern literature. Get your fill here. This is magnificent stuff!

Thomas Frey's review makes a very important point which amazon.com should take to heart. I've experienced the same thing many times, and it's damned irritating. I'm sure amazon customers would appreciate wiser consideration in the matter.Grady Harp says perfectly everything that must be said about Lieberson and this recording. I would only add that listening to Lorraine Hunt Lieberson sing "Ich habe genug" reminds me vividly of listening to Solesmes' aged Dom Gajard sing the part of Jesus in the Abbey's recording of the Good Friday liturgy. Both occasions are born of a transfixion that transcends music and its performance. An imposing spiritual source is immediately and irrevocably present, and seems increased after the musical experience itself. Fortunately for all of us, in this recording Lieberson teaches us the god Bach is and serves him with a miraculous art.

Another superb film by this master, and first rate in every way. Palmer spends ample time on the war years, with valuable contributions from artists, patrons, and bundles of magnificent footage, among which is auspicious footage of the building of the Grosse Festspielhaus, after Karajan forced the Salzburg government to cut loose with the funds to achieve a hall large enough for the big works. The film naturally converges on Karajan's incontestable influence on the Festival, and presents a wonderful, multi-faceted look at the courageous and controversial conductor. Some of the comments from various historians I found to be off the mark, especially one who snidely insists that Karajan was simply a Nazi. Well... that is hardly a viewpoint able to stand on its own, as a reality unto itself and separate from many contributing factors. Bohm and Furtwangler are not treated in the same way by historians, though the three conductors are generally understood to have suffered in the same way throughout the Nazi period. But Palmer should be lauded for his completeness in surveying Karajan. Christa Ludwig's remarks are funny and pungent throughout, as might be expected from this great singer. I'm always struck by the remarks of viewers who criticize films like this because they are not simply films of performances. Ignore that kind of criticism. Tony Palmer goes deep with every effort he makes, and I think this examination of one of the great music festivals in the world is one of his finest films. The length of the film is but one indicator of the depth of his presentation. It's refreshing to watch something not expected to be fathomed and disposed of in 60 minutes. If you want to really understand the Salzburg Festival, this film is the perfect place to start. Unqualified recommendation.

Doesn't surpass the Night in Tuscany concert dvd, but there's a lot of good here. The ever-bubbling debate about Bocelli as classical singer or not goes on. Truth is, he not only sings operatic arias beautifully (if not always traditionally), but his voice opens into new vistas with classical music. Some people dont know that before he hit the American music scene, Bocelli's big success in Italy came as a singer of Italian/European pop music, not opera. Bocelli has princely taste in musical selections, and in this concert manages to overcome Foster's fountains-of-lasagna musical arrangements with sensational singing, and an invigorating personality. He includes 'The Prayer' - this time with Heather Headley. No classical arias are included. Fan or not, there's little here to disappoint. A Night in Tuscany offers more variety, and more muscular singing by Bocelli, but this concert's designed for romance and it delivers the goods.

There's a bunch of fabulous music in this film of concert tangos with the great Argentine on piano, Rodolfo Mederos and Hector Console on bandoleon and double bass. Opening with three Carlos Gardel tangos, interspersed is a rich segment on Gardel and the city of Buenos Aires, fascinating old footage of the city, and tales of Gardel's pivotal historical place in the development of the tango in Argentina, including his fiery aeroplane death and the subsequent public mourning of Buenos Aires. But the film's NEVER dry, indeed the musical performances are each of a piece and filmed live. Moving to Piazzolla, they play his beautiful 'Adios Nonino' - the musicians are masters, and the seductive elevation of a unique musical art ensues. Particularly the bandoleon player matches Barenboim's memorableness in their native literature. Domingo sings tangos, relishing his native tongue with appealing roguishness &Barenboim accompanying him. Later, Domingo plays tango on piano for Barenboim and gets a bravo. Throughout the film the music is just spectacular! Barenboim's his customary intense and interested self, musing on the history of tango and his personal relationship to his native Buenos Aires. Pianistically, his mystical inhabitation of Ginastera's La moza donosa is a cache of stealth riches from beginning to end, much like the film itself. At just under an hour long, it fortunately feels longer! Whatever Daniel Barenboim touches sizzles, and this is a viewing experience to savor - inimitable music making in a winningly classy film.

The older I get the more I appreciate Scotto the singer. Her musicianship was always apparent, always admired. Yet she may have been underestimated as a singer. Her embodiment of the intense inner life of the characters she portrayed is rightfully legendary, but I've come to believe a great part of that perfect passion is the singing, as much as her gifts as an actor and interpreter. The voice itself is rarely perfect, but still beautiful; especially in the first half of her career, the top of her voice fashioned a world of its own, and left nothing wanting. So many fine singers today make a kind of perfect product, yet often fall short of leaving an enduring art of earthly grief and passion. They fly high but often forsake the humanist aesthetic central to operatic art. Scotto plumbs that passion in so much of her singing, and wonderful example of that is found than in these arias. She lets her instrument and her musicianship create the intimate space between singing and acting, never imposing an arbitrary idea around either. Her 'Sola, perduta, Abbandonata' is one of the best versions I've heard. She gifts 'Mio babbino caro' with unhurried beauty. She's a great verismo singer, as was Ileana Cotrubas, though few enough mention either artist nowadays. This disc is a perfect introduction to the art of Renata Scotto.

5star highlights of this Covent Garden production are the closing twenty minutes of American Catherine Malfitano's singing of the title role -merciless intensity and voracious singing! - and the magnificent performance of Bryn Terfel as Jokanaan. We enjoyed seeing Malfitano's Cio-Cio San in Butterfly in San Francisco in the late nineties, and her singing here is even more engaged, more opened - a real success. There are aspects to her singing that can be bothersome at times; a lack of extravagant vocal reserves creates a sometimes monotonous approach to color, a feeling that she is always using everything she has, although she finds vocal color and drama aplenty in the closing scene. In general, however, It's hard to fault her Salome in this production - she's up to the task vocally and is a superb singing actor, one of the best around. Made for the camera (and the camera work here is unfailingly fine), Malfitano delivers a non-stop performance that exposes every nerve of Strauss' insane Princess. Terfel is as compelling a Jokanaan as I've ever heard - wild and devout and determined, plenty of physical braun and as musically committed a John the Baptist as might be possible. His singing is perfect, and his presence compelling. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Dohnanyi's disengaged conducting and the formulaic blandness of the Covent Garden orchestra leaves a lot to be desired. Some of it seems to be the recorded sound which never rises to compete with the stage action, but I sense a lack of direction on Dohnanyi's part, surprising since I'm an admirer of his orchestral conducting in general. The evocative tension of Strauss' orchestral writing of the last half hour never materializes. Can't explain this misstep, but it noticably diminishes the vibrancy of the production. In contrast to some reviews on this page, Riegel's Herod is ardently sung - the arrogance of Herod's cravenness is striking and convincing, indicating not only acting chops but a bountiful, solid singing technique. If only the orchestra didnt sound as if it were on vacation! All in all, one of the best filmed Salomes available, superior by leagues to the redoubtable Maria Ewing's shouted version at the same house, and in my view, better than the Malfitano/Estes Berlin version, especially in the art design department. Here, the focus is completely on the singing drama, and is the better for it. After Deborah Voigt's very recent Chicago triumph in her first staged Salome, we can hope she will commit a performance to video disc. Don't hesitate with this one, however. It delivers the goods.

An interesting account of papal history, especially respecting the relatively secret business of papal election. Hebblethwaite takes the perspective of the left within the Church. It therefore has none of the profoundness one desires, but there are for the inquisitive a number of sly tidbits concerning the Monarchy that elects. It seems written with a certain love for the Church and the papacy, if not for the disappeared (or quietly reappearing, it seems) remnants of its Tridentine past. The first two-thirds of the book deals a fairly dull view of papacies Pius IX through Pius XII, then turns a focus on Paul VI. Montini's stint is treated roughly by Burkle-Young, not that that's off-sync, but it's surprising given the good the author believes unfolded through Second Vatican Council; Paul VI's unique dedication was to fleshing out the post-Conciliar ethos and spirit in the life of the Church. An interesting section details how Paul VI used shaping of the College of Cardinals to essentially alter the Church for all time. Indeed, though Burkle-Young doesn't, one could argue that Paul VI's revolutionary restructuring of the Sacred College did more than any Council document to effect a successful repeal of Catholicism- the 'auto-destruction' of which pope Montini explicitly remarked more than once. Burkle-Young's description of the papacy of John Paul II is almost comical at times, alarmed over its 'Tridentine inclinations', calling John Paul II's the most conservative papacy since Pius X! Wojtyla has his sense of the dramatic, to be sure, but 'conservative' is an inapt epithet for what's been a revolutionary papacy, for good or ill. The best revelation is that Wojtyla, elected pope, wanted to take the name Stanislaus but was overruled by Benelli, the dark hand. How much better a Pope Stanislaus than the ubiquitous John Paul, which seems to evoke a tennis player, or French hall singer. Burkle-Young's observation with respect to 'olives', Cardinal Martini, and the family name itself are wry and worthy. The book owns some scholarship; it's not too gossipy, but enough. 4 stars is generous, but 'Passing the Keys' probably deserves it.

This is a fine CD. Hazel & Alice sing in lean and almost abrupt lines, peculiarly American, and their original songs are startling and beautiful. There's nothing outwardly prettified about the music - it's hard and strong and heartbreaking. But that directness frees ruminative sentiment to run deep through each song and allows these two artists to construct music that resonates meaningfully. Alice uses some unique banjo tunings, and their vocals practice the expected Appalachian flat tuning method with unexpected warmth and intimacy. 'A Few More years Shall Roll', taken from the Primitive Baptist Hymn Book, especially shows an unrivalled vocal mastery. This is the only Hazel and Alice disc I've heard, but would be inclined to try others.

As unpredictable (and occasionally unsettling) as Maria Ewing has proven to be as a singing actor, her performance as Carmen in this film is unassailable. She owns every inch of it, and from her stunning committment the whole piece blazes like a fire. The results can be unsatisfying when Ewing takes on a role (her Salome comes to mind), but, as a voice teacher and coach, I've yet to find a performance of hers that fails to completely exemplify an unyielding prescription: I tell my students - singing is an act of daring and committment in which you must literally be willing to die. It's that simple - and that profound. Ewing grabs hold of her art in the way Callas did. Like Callas, she has suffered in the voice department - willingly and knowingly, I suspect. Her Carmen misses no opportunity to rebel, to ignite, but Ewing is an actor of magnitude and knows the boundaries; pushes against them, but never at the cost of making real art. She's manifestly a singer of intelligence, breathtaking risk and seduction, always. This particular Carmen strikes me as her finest performance committed to film. I like this version filmed without an audience because it doesnt attempt to become an 'outdoor' film. Bizet's original ideas are thereby showcased to magnificent advantage, musically and dramatically. Kudos to this one-of-a-kind artist for an incomparable Carmen here; it's a take no prisoners performance. McCauley's thick and unwieldy tenor fails to impress, whatever the macho/puppydog presence may provide. An able actor, his singing is generic, if reliable. I've enjoyed Marie McLaughlin at Glyndebourne, and her turn as Micaela is satisfactory, a bit wary - better than tenor McCauley - but I could name a number of memorable Micaelas without mentioning her. Maria Ewing is firepit, kindling, logs, match, and blazing glory from beginning to end in this film, and she alone makes it worth double the price here! On her bewitching account alone, hotly recommended!

This Royal Opera La Boheme is sterling in every way. Shicoff and Cotrubas are complete musicians first and foremost, and the singing is unconquerable. Neil Shicoff is one of the great tenors of his or any musical age, and his unfailing musicianship makes his singing beautiful beyond many others of more fabled estate. Perhaps no other singer (except Caballe and Ludwig) was more loved by orchestral musicians than Ileana Cotrubas, in equal measure for her impeccable musicianship and an unforgettable voice that carries a glow of tragedy deep in its emerald sound. She's a perfect verismo singer, though curiously few acknowledge it. With Cotrubas nothing is exaggerated, nothing out of pulse; she invests it all in actually singing, eschewing 'showing us' her singing - an unfortunately prevalent malaise. Thomas Allen's Marcello is bright and ardent, &the leaving scene with Rodolfo works up some vocal fire. Zschau exerts herself as Musetta, but not without delight. Gardelli marshals the Covent Garden forces with typical Royal Opera understatement and gets a huge ovation at the end. A traditionally staged Boheme recommended with passion to just about everybody. The singing's exceptionally bracing and beautiful. Cotrubas' revealing death scene can change your mind about Puccini. I think the VHS version has better sound, but the DVD is fine. I urge you to give this production a hearing.

A gutsy, beautiful looking film, a score which if not Britten's greatest opera is easily one of the most beautiful, a tested and sympathetic conductor, and the great John Shirley-Quirk reprising the Traveller opposite Robert Gard - what's not to love! Palmer makes customary magic with every determining motive behind the camera. Nothing stops his vision. The colors of the film evoke Visconti's, as they might; Aschenbach's Venice isn't changed. What music! Here's an opera that ought to be taken up and done regularly. Britten is misheard in his operas in America, to some extent. We needn't a revival so much as first and true consent. This is one of the last century's greatest operas, which if not neglected remains misapprehended, perhaps, despite Visconti's evocative film. The orchestral forces positively slither out of the orchestra pit. Recording balances are fine, with shimmer and intimacy. Steuart Bedford's ardent gifts thrive in nuance after nuance. He's a master at opening an orchestra's sound from the inside out, and Britten's bounty of gorgeously seductive music provides a glistening canvas to fan. I agree the Tadzio actor is not compelling, but Gard sings Aschenbach masterfully, with real lights about who the character is for Mann. Robert Tear's Aschenbach is winningly sung, but this production packs everything that only Palmer brings to a film effort. He's a filmmaker who deeply understands music. It makes all the difference. Huge recommendation for a grave and wondrous score, and a film worthy of Britten's last, great opera.

I don't see much mentioned in the reviews here that this film incorporates information from Soviet files not available until the 1990s. One important outcome is a new and welcomed delineation of the lying duplicity of Churchill, his involvement in handing half of Europe to Stalin, sentencing the eastern bloc nations to half a century of Stalinist suffering. On the whole, the film presents a view of history distinct from that motorically habituated in the West. The dramatised scenes are theatrically believable, and serve a useful artifice to carry the piece toward that admirable end. Poland's crucifixion is always centerpiece, much of her wartime history well known, division by Germany and Russia etc. but the callous designs of the allied powers in that sacrifice are schooled in this piece with new cold clarity. An effort worthy on many counts, not least the service of history, and a substantive look at multiple faces of evil. Recommended for its severe accomplishment.

Despite the undisputed popularity of her recordings, the highly festooned singing of Cecilia Bartoli remains for me an enigma. While it is difficult to wholly admire Bartoli's work in this recording of rare Vivaldi opera arias, one is yet somehow captivated by the startling 'blitzkrieg' technique she has more or less invented in order to create the final vocal product. Because of the sheer munificence of her native gifts -however one judges their ultimate musical value- it is difficult to say exactly HOW she does what she does, except to say that this is not bel canto art, and that therefore her technical prowess is strangely para-vocal. Watching her sing, one is inclined to credit her will, throat, jaw, mouth and eyes (in that order) with much of the physical work required to sing this music as she does, at breakneck speed and with felicitous accuracy, rather than using the full reach of her body to produce the sound. I've never been convinced that Bartoli is a true mezzo, and while perhaps in the end that will prove itself to be a muted argument, it would seem to help explain the coiled stress of her sound, this refusal to allow the vocal cords their natural relaxation in order to free the voice's true organic temper. Her singing, while it can be beautiful, is often painful to hear. I believe it is Bartoli's natural musical intelligence that saves whatever is of value in the end. She's an incredibly adept singer, no doubt, but even more, the take-no-prisoners passion with which she imbues her art, her abiding love for its immediacy and its importance, go a long way toward making up for a kind of virtuosic brutality that only Vivaldi could have committed. Twenty minutes of this stuff and you feel like you've been circling the room on a ceiling fan! For all that, however, this is, oddly, a uniquely successful disc. One feels the inevitability of this mix of singer and music, in a word, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. For me, this is often true of Cecilia Bartoli's work, and something that for me speaks to the authenticity of her artistic conscience. Whatever one makes of the score, or of the voice, or of the technique, one must in the end acknowledge that here is a prodigy at work; and the music she makes is worth listening to because within it one always discovers something useful about one's own music, one's own art. Preoccupation with the inherent meaning of art, which one finds in Cecilia Bartoli's music, is the telling mark of an authentic artist.

This centenary series of the Complete Works is a major accomplishment. Volume I ('I Have Found God') goes right to the heart of Elizabeth's mystical vocation with a positively riveting General Introduction by Conrad De Meester, O.C. D., followed by a brilliant translation of Elizabeth's writings by Alethia Kane. Elizabeth's four major spiritual treatises being written in the last three months of her life, it's difficult to go anywhere but to the distinct heart of her message. I doubt that I've ever read a more enlightened essay on Elizabeth than De Meester's. If you look to understand who this woman was, read his perfect Introduction; taken together with a brief biography, he produces an ancient Elizabeth in an essential light. His appreciation burns with real insight into an obscured message and an authentic modern mystic. Kane leaves Elizabeth's voice alone, as other translators have not, making Kane's courageous, and ultimately peerless contribution the more valuable by leagues. Highest recommendation for Vols. I &amp; II-- it's a champion series.

Emil Gilels' Ravel is always shattering (his old Melodiya recording of the Pavane can only be characterised as made by god!) and this recording's Ravel is no exception. To my mind, Gilels is the supreme pianist of the last century, and relatively unappreciated in the West, due partly to his, as well as Furtseva's, decision not to tour much during the Soviet years, and partly, I've always suspected, because he clearly is a kind of anti-Russian pianist, I'm saying, relative to the mold of Horowitz, Ashkenazy, Kissin, etc. Gilels commands by the subtlest suggestion, persuasion of a kind no longer heard on the classical stage. The Bach on this recording is a lesson for every pianist, truly. An unbearably perfect RESPECT on Gilels' part for Bach's thought, even, I think, an intrinsic desire for Bach's religiousness! The D Major is mesmerizing. Having heard it, you will never forget it. The Debussy (Images I) is everything it can be, more finely sifted than Gieseking's, and the Mozart -the amazing 27th with that loping First Movement- is miraculous, rich and rhythmical! This is fine stuff, people! The Weber (Horowitz liked this piece, too!) is so brilliant, it barks! The audacious last movement will knock your socks off! But for me, the Ravel is everything; `Jeux d'eau' sparkles like the morning, and the `Alborada' has the most majestic dancing heart- it'll take your breath away. Get all the Gilels you can find, recordings of this man's art are not abundant, but the rewards are life-altering.

The C Minor Paritita is beautifully played, sometimes I'm not sure who Argerich IS, but in the end, it's beautiful. I recently heard Angela Hewitt's Bach, incidentally, and it's surpassing. The Liszt is revolutionary, however much it really is a concerto one can do without. And this is one of the finest versions of the Prokofiev 3rd around! The third movement gets all of Argerich's natural rhythmic attention, that stupendous, measured propulsion that makes her art so dangerous! There is an earlier Ravel Concerto with Berlin and Abbado, not this one, with a more perceptively drawn second movement- I still have it on cassette! can't seem to find a CD edition of it- better than this one, but this one's easily the best around, without a doubt! Argerich's play with Ravel's ingenious rhythms is natural like walking, or spinning. The Gaspard is the finest recording in this collection, and worth twice the price of it! She's a pianist made for Ravel! I remember playing the Sonatine in college- marvelous piece with a memorable miniature for a second movement; Argerich knows the braveness of Ravel's kingdom, and now so does everybody else. There is nothing in these two discs to disappoint you. I listen to them often, and find I often want a brandy afterward -something to calm, and share the lingering.

This 1983 open-air performance is a thoroughly professional, traditionally staged Madama Butterfly likely to please most admirers of this opera. Tenor Nazzareno Antinori is a real surprise - he does some wonderful singing, especially in the third Act. His 'Addio, fiorito asil' is quite something! Beautiful phrasing and a confident, melting expressiveness once he gets warmed up. Kaibaivanska not so much - I don't understand some opera fans' devotedness to this singer. And not only fans, she's a singer greatly respected by her colleagues around the world. I've seen her Tosca and Butterfly. She gets the job done, explicitly at times, but her singing lacks character. Plenty of rubenesque tone, not a lot of color; yet, when she turns it on, the colors she creates with her singing can be captivating. Her singing is inconsistent - one moment quite beautiful, the next pretty boring. There are occasional intonation problems in the top notes. It is hard, however, to fault her Butterfly, at least in this recorded performance, but for a peculiar wooden quality to her singing at times, overtly careful, technically assured, but somewhat colorless. Maurizio Arena's conducting is staid and predictable, but not without merit. The Verona orchestra responds lithely, always conscious of the actors on stage, to Arena's credit. The staging is what we've seen before, middle-of-the-road agreeable but nothing defining. Sound is excellent throughout, thanks I'm sure in large part to Brian Large's expert direction of a film project which never fails to impress with its purposefulness. I agree with the reviews remarking on the excellent closeup shots - the wonders of the video age! Scotto's Butterfly breaks your heart, and Price had tremendous vocal reserves to endow her version with immortality - Raina Kaibaivanska falls short on both counts, but gives a reliable performance overall of a notoriously vocally dangerous role. The physical demands alone of the role caused L. Price to quit it early on. If a truly fine filmed version of Butterfly exists, I havent found it. Still, lovers of Puccini's enduring masterpiece will find some good moments to champion in this DVD version. Tenor Nazzareno Antinori and director Brian Large commit impeccable work and deserve kudos. Subtitles included.

Thich Nhat Hanh's life is a spiritual teaching in itself, and it comes through magnificently in this brief film. His thoughtful and penetrating responses to the off-camera interviewer are wonderful to behold. His whole being is quiet and supple, fully engaged and spiritually beguiling, handling profound questions with noble ease. What a teacher! Knowing Nhat Hanh's incredible personal history of struggle during the Vietnam war helps to focus an understanding of his remarks on suffering; like Merton, he forges a synthesis of wide spiritual understanding to transcend the sectarian bottlenecks that plague contemporary religious practice. This monk is a living witness to the far horizons of human compassion. Door of Compassion curls its way through the listener frame by frame, inspiring and consoling anyone who seeks it. Many times worth the price listed here.

In one of his last utterances, shortly before his death, Vaughan Williams said: "Modernism and conservatism are irrelevant. What matters it to be true to oneself." Simon Heffer's accomplished 150page biography of Vaughan Williams ably proves the verity of the great composer's personal creed with distinctive prose that luckily also includes a skilled overview (and some cherished details) of his musical works.Heffer secures the essential threads between VW's family (his father, at his son's birth, was the Vicar of Down Ampney and his mother was a Wedgewood, and neice of Charles Darwin) and his lifelong output of quintessentially English music. The author wisely allows this bucolic picture of gentle privilege to continuously and subtly inform the dialogue of Vaughan Williams' life and work, gradually creating a full look on firm ground of a thoroughly cosmopolitan composer.The discussions of VW's compositions are exceptionally competent and always evocative. Heffer' reach is impressive - from VW's undramatic beginnings as a composer, his constant affection for and lavish attention to the English hymn tune, his musical study with Ravel and its effect on his work, through to the daring influence of blues and jazz found in his symphonies, notably the use of vibraphones that inform the beguiling Eighth.This book is a great deal like VW's music itself - profound and gentle, inspiring and intimate. Recommended over other more lengthy biographies of VW, length not always equalling depth of treatment in these matters. In this important little book, the two aspects combine in perfect conformity to the living testament that is VW's music itself. This book is a full, revealing look at a composer who spent his creative life conjuring manifold beauty and nurturing his unique gifts with the uncommon genius of steady, humane purpose. The appendix of select discography with incisive commentary is also useful especially for those not that familiar with VW's music.
