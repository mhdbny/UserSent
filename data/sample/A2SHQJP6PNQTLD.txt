In many ways, this book is like an R rated movie. Sure, high school students who are forced to read it &quot;understand&quot; it superficially, but the material hits home once you have matured and experienced some of the themes brought up in the novel. I liked it in high school, but as an adult, it resonates much more. I just reread the book after having not looked at it for over 10 years. The beginning does drag a bit, but the superb chapters near the end when Dimmsdale meets Hester in the forest after having not seen her or Pearl for 7 years make it all worthwhile. Even the writing becomes more vivid. During one great scene, Dimmsdale is allowed a moment of realization when he says to Hester than Chillingsworth's sin is much blacker than his own because it was done with malice. Dimmsdale realizes that his soul is not the blackest of all and to me, this gives him some level of redemption, at least on a personal level. The last 8 chapters or so are spellbinding as they bring up themes of sin, lust, and love against the horrifying behavior of the evil &quot;physician&quot; Chillingsworth. If you are forced to read this in high school, try to get past the sometimes opaque writing and give it a chance.

I think I experienced the ultimate reading sensation when approaching this book. I had just come back from Spain and my Spanish was pretty good, so I decided to read it in English and Spanish at the same time. Since there was no facing page edition (like Pinsky's Inferno translation of Dante which is the best of both possible worlds), I had to buy a Spanish copy and an English copy. For the first half, I read the English first and then the Spanish chapters, but for the latter half, I was warmed up enough to read the Spanish chapter first and then the English. The effort is well worth it in any language. Rabassa (a Dartmouth alum, my alma mater) is a great translator and does justice to this magnificant work. The reader who said that he dogeared the genealogy page is correct -- once you can keep the different generations straight, you are well on your way to being drawn into the magical world. Not only is it a great novel in its own right, it's mandatory reading because so many authors (and not just Latin American ones) use his magic realism style. Some of my personal favorite authors like Murakami and Jonathan Carroll borrow liberally from this style, sometimes not even consciously. Marquez paved the way for scores of Latin American writers, put Latin American literature on the map and influenced huge numbers of other writers as well. I loved every moment of the experience of reading this book -- the ending is so shockingly good that it's worth committing the last page to memory.

From what I had read about this book, I expected an instant classic that would live up to its inspiration, Huck Finn. Though I enjoyed the book's leisurely pace and solid writing, I found it somewhat ordinary. The actual events are captivating as we witness the young protagonist who gains an extra digit (turns 10) as the book opens experience his childhood. We learn before the book starts that his father died before he was born, so he lives with his mother and 3 uncles (her brothers) who never married. I enjoyed the opening chapters in which Jim goes out into the field with his uncles to try his hand at hoeing, only to find out that it's much harder than he thought. This, and the other central incident involving his friendship with Penn and a brief encounter with Ty Cobb were the highlights of the novel. It's very readable and does give a well-rendered view of growing up in a small, rural American town. I just felt that there was still too much distance between Jim and the reader to really get inside the character the same way we do while reading a book like Huck Finn. A very good novel, but a few steps short of great.

During the time I lived in Spain, I remember vividly tuning into the tertulias that were on every day, often featuring famous writers like Cela or Marquez commenting on issues of the day. I marveled over the fact that unlike in our American talk shows, they actually ate food, had coffee, and really got into their conversations in an in-depth manner.Thus it was with much anticipation that I picked up this book which features a group of woman who meet in a tertulia fashion to discuss everything from beauty and dating to betrayal and loss. Our narrator is the only non-Latina, but she fits right in since she speaks Spanish and relates to the culture. The others hail from various professional fields. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was slightly disappointed. I never felt that I learned enough about any one person to care that much about what happened to her. Therefore, I found myself feeling somewhat detached even through various tales of illness and infidelity. The narrative is a bit scattered and doesn't hold together at times. There is very little in the way of real character development. A good first novel with some promising scenes.

I don't disagree with the criticisms of her writing, but I have to admit that while I was reading the book, I found the story compelling. Yes, Into Thin Air was much better overall and much better written, but give the woman a break --it was still an interesting account and refreshing to hear from a female climber stuck in a male climbing world. For the hour or so it took me to read it, I did not develop any animosity towards the author and simply kept reading to find out what happens. And boy was I glad to be able to walk outside and get some sun when I finished.

Woolf is a genius -- this is one of the most enjoyable and interesting novels you may ever read. No where has the ego and greed of Wall Street in its heyday been so exposed along with all the conventions and pretenses of the newly rich and famous. Few readers will forget the opening page with &quot;Shuuuurmen&quot; blaring out. The characters are unforgettable and Woolf is an absolute genius at capturing detail in both his dialogue and description. One of my favorite all time novels. At once fun, and great literature.

Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed.

As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed.

It's amazing how much of its original power this play has maintained even though by all accounts it should be dated by now. After all, we have come far, have we not, from the south in those backwards years? Or have we? This was one of the works that we read in my AP English class this year and I was surprised how well a group of 11th graders were able to identify with the sexual tension, the deceptions, the characters and the plot. Blanche's hopeless situation is still quite poignant and Stanley's animal magnetism is something all of them could relate to. After reading the play countless times (and seeing various performances), I can say that this short play packs quite a wallop. Williams fits in a myriad of human emotions into this one short play. If for some reason you missed this one, read it and then rent the movie with Marlon Brando. With memorable characters like Stanley, Stella, Blanch and Mitch who have made their way into our everyday vocubulary, and a sizzling dialogue, it's a lasting work. The movie Body Heat is the closest modern parallel I can think of in terms of setting and mood.

Many readers who start with Austen's longer, more complex works, quickly get overwhelmed and throw up their hands in frustration. Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary.

Finally, days after writing a review of the Madman and theProfessor, I remembered that this was the book that I enjoyed so muchmore. While the author of that book went for the cheesy effects and Victorian tricks, this author concentrated on the making of the dictionary itself and the extraordinary devotion of Murray. It is inspiring to read about people back in those days who really devoted their lives to invention and intellectual pursuits. Once you read the description of the scriptorium and how Murray farmed out assignments to literally thousands of readers, you'll appreciate why the OED is such an important reference work. If not for marketing, this book would be the best seller about the making of the OED. A great read from start to finish.

Not only is this the best collection of Jobim's endlessly gratifying music, it's one of the most beautiful CD packages ever put together. In an age where most CD's are hastily thrown into poorly designed cases, this is truly a collector's item -- each CD paper sleeve is cut into fish and other shapes for their respective CD's. The liner notes are great, you'll find out everything about Jobim's recording and life -- they just don't make them like this anymore. And did I mention that the music is positively mind-altering? Order this immediately, wait for a rainy day, sit down on your coach and spin all three CD's. Time will fly by and you will emerge purified.

This is a gorgeous recording of many of Jobim's well-known songs by Joe Henderson. I have listened to many of Henderson's other CDs, but none are as lush and heartfelt as this one. Whether you love Brazilian music, or whether you just love saxophone, you will love this CD and listen to it many times.

If you missed this book in your childhood, it's not too late to read it right away. This remains one of my favorite books of all time. I can still remember almost every major scene -- who could forget these two friends meeting over a baseball accident that almost blinded Reuven Malter. Of all the books on relationships between kids, this is my favorite. It's extremely well written, and the way their friendship develops is incredibly touching. Even better, the reader will be taken inside some of the most interesting descriptions of Hasidism and orthodox Jewry to be found anywhere. In fact, when I first read this book, I got interested in Gematria, a Hebrew form of numerology and ended up years later writing a huge research paper on the topic. This book is a bit hard for 8th and 9th graders but strong readers should have no trouble. It's rare that a book this intellectual and this educational be so moving.

I'm not the most unbiased reviewer because I have to confess that I have read every book that Barry has ever written including his not so stellar novel. Still, I can't imagine anyone I'd ever want to have coffee with not thinking this book is hysterical. I'm always amazed at his turn of phrase and wit in every single article on any topic imaginable. Whether he's talking about flushing &quot;acts of congress&quot; (#2) down a low gallon toilet or his coffee addiction, he makes me laugh out loud every 2 minutes. I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't realize I was near the end and sat around not believing that it had ended. Then, I entered a deep depression.... Okay, I'm lying, but I was disappointed that I didn't have another one of his books right there to keep me going.If you've never read Barry before, rush out and buy this. I guarantee that within minutes, you'll be dialing friends and relatives to read snippets out loud -- I try to, but I ususually collapse into gales of laughter while I'm trying.

I know the comparison is odd, but since I just saw Memento a few weeks ago, I find it appropos -- both the movie and this book start in the present and work their way to the past. This style works well in the book although it may disorient the reader momentarily as we slide back into time. The author does a nice job researching the time periods so that the book reads with a fine sense of historical plausibility. I enjoyed the various intertwined stories although at times they read more like separate vignettes than a novel (but they were separate stories). Overall I preferred another current Vermeer book, Girl with a Pearl Earring because it focused more on Vermeer and less on the side characters. This book focuses on the effect of a Vermeer painting on various families which is at least an interesting take on events. A short book, well worth reading.

The publishing world has been shamelessly promoting this award winning book -- I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was quite as much of a hoot as many critics must have. Sure, I laughed at Ignatius' over-active sphincter and his total loser personality, but after a few hundred pages of his manic thoughts, I begain to tire of him. yes, I think the book is a classic, but once you're over the main part of the story, I doubt you'll roll in the aisles laughing. Maybe I'm a heathen, but I laughed much more at every Dave Barry book.

Okay, maybe I'm being picky because I'm on this Jonathan Carroll streak right now and just finished four of his other books before this one. Like his great books, this one has brilliant scenes, concepts and wild plot devices, but I found that it didn't hold together as well as his others. At times, it seems like even Carroll might have lost one of his own threads. This book made me appreciate how great his new one, Marriage of Sticks, is. If you haven't read anything by Carroll before, I'd stick to his others first. If you're a Carroll freak like I am, you'll want to search this one out. Rondua appears in this one too and you may recognize Finky-Linky and some of the usual suspects.

I must be the only person who read this book years before the movie came out. As a child, this was one of my very favorite books that I have since reread many times. Lord captures everything: the social mores, the lavish banquets, the characters (the captain!), the conditions on the rest of the ship, and the tragedy of it all. The movie leaves nothing to the imagination, but this account is truly superb. If you never got a chance to read it, don't delay. You'll learn almost everything about the tragedy from a master story teller. The scenes right before they strike the iceburg are incredible, as are every scene of the evacuation. Finally, it's clear why no one wanted to leave the security of the ship. The worst tragedy of all was that many of the lifeboats were lowered with hardly anyone on them because they were afraid to leave the ship. Many more lives could have been saved.

I started with Open House which is much deeper and more profound, but I still enjoyed this shorter book. What I like most about Berg's writing is her ability to capture personal thoughts and feelings of real people with all their vulnerabilities and problems. I agree with those who thought the mother plot was a bit much, but the central plot was very well done with the usual cast of oddball characters. I wanted to find out more about Mark, but the Ethan character was well-drawn. Now that I've read one of her best and her supposed worst (which is still quite good), I'm motivated to read her others. The writing and characters make Berg a terrific writer and her books great reads. If you don't want to read this one, at least try one of her others to see what you've been missing.

I agree with the majority of reviewers who point out the uneveness of this collection. Part of me kept asking, &quot;And why NOW are we reading some of these old essays?&quot; But, since I love Wolfe's writing, I could forgive him some moments of indulgence. I liked the Bragg piece and the New Yorker bits and the hooking up essay, but some of the other ones are actually dull in parts -- except for the writing I guess you'd say. When Wolfe is at his best, he can rip others to shreds and keep that grin on his face. At his low point, he fails to stimulate much interest in his current rant. I happen to think he excels at pop culture. I wanted more &quot;hooking up&quot; essays with his trenchant observations about our culture. Instead, we get more of a random selection of good essays that jump all over the map.

I've read the other Fool books -- this one is much more basic and covers much more than just stock picking methods. If you believe that your financial advisor is a real expert, or you have credit card debt, or you don't know how to get the best price on a car, this is a must read. I knew all the basic stuff until I got to stocks which I'm far from an expert in. What I like about the Fool books (besides the humor and light tone which is always appreciated) is that they explain in plain English the meaning behind the numbers. Want to know what a dividend percentage yield really MEANS? You get the idea. Their basic Dow 4 strategy seems a bit oversimplified, but the point is that we should all realize that WE have all the information we need to make well-informed decisions for ourselves and do not need to rely on others. That idea alone (and a common theme running through the books) is worth the price of admission.

I'm troubled that many young people in these reviews don't seem to appreciate this novel. Even when &quot;forced&quot; to read it in high school, I loved it. I've read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it's better than I remembered it. I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami's book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up. This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that's not perfect. I have to agree -- it's not just the plot, it's the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later. Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby's parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea. For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend. It's so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory. Don't miss out on this one. If you didn't like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature.

If you love language at all, ask your favorite relative to buyyou this as a present. I probably refer to it every day because it'sso darn interesting. It's not just definitions -- it's the history of every word in the English language from its first recorded use. This dictionary is indispensible if you are reading any older English authors (Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare) because you don't have to guess -- you can see just what the word meant at that point in time. Half the time when you look up a word, you'll note that Shakespeare is the first recorded usage of the word. In case you weren't in awe of Shakespeare before, now you will be since many of our English usages are thanks to his skill. For the past few years I've kept this reference in my school office and almost everyday a student will come in to look up a word. Once you're done being in awe of this book, you'll probably want to read about how James Murray spent his whole life on the project. I don't mind the magnifier that comes with the dictionary, but if you're very nearsighted, you may want to opt for a multivolume edition. I enjoy the convenience of one volume, albeit somewhat large with microscopic print.

This companion book to Carle's "Brown Bear, Brown Bear" is another winner. Rather than focusing on the visual, it focuses on the auditory: "Polar Bear, Polar Bear, what do you hear? I hear a lion, roaring in my ear; lion, lion, what do you hear..." The illustrations are big and captivating and the phrasing hard to beat for young children learning how to read. Along with Brown Bear, my 3 year old memorized this book after just a few readings and now reads it aloud to anyone who will listen. My only very tiny complaint is the choice of words in two cases: does a peacock really "yelp" or does a flamingo really "flute." Not sure about that. In any case, this is a classic.

I agree with many of my fellow reviewers -- it's a solid bookwith lots of insight into Chinese customs, but it's not nearly at thelevel of winning something as major as the National Book Award. After the first 100 pages or so, the narrative starts to unwind a bit -- if not for the fact that i don't like to leave a book unfinished, I wouldn't have kept going. Plus, the main character was so devoid of passion that it was hard to believe that he would have even made it through the 18 year wait. I suppose the ending has a philosophical point (ending up back where you started), but I found it unsatisfying. Remains of the Day was much better in the vein of inability to acknowledge feelings and emotions while a book like Memoirs of a Geisha was infinitely more interesting. I did enjoy this book, I just thought it was 100 pages too long and not quite at the National Book Award level. For both those reasons, I found it disappointing overall although I certainly enjoyed parts of the book.

This album has inspired me to seek out his first more traditional album. Though I too find all these songs infectious, I enjoy the traditional element more and sometimes find the harsh rock guitar overwhelming -- I guess it's that I enjoy the Algerian side of the music more than the driving guitar side. Still, these songs are excellent. I've listened to the CD about 10 times and am still not tired of it at all. It's even good to exercise to. If you like more mellow sounding North African music, try Radio Tarifa which to my taste is perhaps a tad better, but it's a close call.

I can't believe I reached my 30's (even majored in English) without reading Moby Dick. I was turned off on Melville during college when an overzealous teacher assigned us what he called Melville's &quot;worst book,&quot; Pierre, Or the Ambiguities. I still don't remember WHY he chose that one, but it was not particularly good. So, while I hunted down many classics, this was not one of them. Then, after finding an old edition in a library sale for $.10, I decided it must be a sign. I was completely enraptured from the beginning. The opening chapters that describe Ismael and Queequog's relationship are stunning. Then, the focus shifts and like the crew, we become accustomed to life on the ship. In fact, the process of reading Moby Dick mirrors the process of getting your sea legs. The years at sea drag on almost as long for us, but I don't mean this in a bad way. I found the whaling chapters fascinating although I did expect to be bored by them. Looking back, it's interesting that Ishmael becomes so secondary in the middle of the book we feel a kind of literary illusion that he disappears until the end. Instead, we take on the characteristics of the crew watching with horror as fixation takes over Ahab. My favorite scene takes place when Ahab is so crazed in his single minded pursuit that he turns down the captain of the Rachel's request to look for his lost son. Though reading Moby Dick is a struggle, lots of great literature doesn't come easy (Magic Mountain comes to mind) -- if you're up for the challenge, go for it. It's infinitely rewarding for a strong reader. Plus, you can always rent the movie with Gregory Peck which is pretty damned good and much shorter!

It's hard to describe the effect of these stories -- perhaps mindbending would be as close as you can get. Who else would devote whole stories to keys, or a meteorologist strike or the founder of a nudist camp? My only small complaint is that at times some of the stories, especially those taking place in the academic realm, are almost too clever for their own good. The collection as a whole though is strong and quite imaginative and profound. Shields is certainly an interesting writer -- there is nary a dull moment and some quite enlightening ones.

Audra (the reviewer below) and I must be blood sisters because everything she said in her review I agree with 100% and then some. I'm a big Richard Gere fan and like almost every movie just because I get to watch him. This movie is so bad that I started to even hate Richard Gere. Not to mention that Winona Ryder was SO unconvincing (why did this womanizer fall in love with her anyway? There is absolutely no reason in the movie to show why they are suddenly in love) that I was rooting for her death early on in the movie. I don't want to give away the plot, but by the end, let's just say that I felt a bit better about the movie overall. Everything about this film was bad: pathetic plot development, poor supporting roles, dialogue so bad that you may find yourself wincing over and over again, unimaginative cinematography that doesn't even make New York look good in Autumn, cheesy scenes... I won't go on. Not much chemistry either between the two. It's been months since I've hated a movie this much, and I think that says a lot since I love Gere and I had pretty low expectations -- this one sunk even lower than that. Read a good book instead.

Ever since I saw Derek Jacobi in the play Breaking the Code (about Alan Turing and his Enigma code-breaking), I've been interested in codes. Singh is a great story teller and this book is as engrossing as the latest Grisham novel. I happen to like how he leads us right into the internet cryptology process which is must reading for anyone who has ever ordered a book on Amazon! By the end of this book, you'll understand the mechanics behind a &quot;secure transaction.&quot; I can't wait to read his book on Fermat.

As a a high school English teacher, I've reread this book about 8 times and have taught it over the years to many students. Although it's certainly a complex novel, it's basic storyline is not hard to follow -- just the narrative style which shifts voices quite a bit. One thing that helps when reading anything by Morrison, but especially Beloved, is to remember that she herself is a classicist. Do yourself a favor and read the Medea myth -- you will suddenly understand 100 times more than you would if you skip it. I would also recommend NOT watching the movie, particularly if you are looking for explanations. Parts were well done, but the book is so rich that it seems mean to lower the dignity of the prose by showing private scenes. It's an incredibly rich and lyric novel with strains of Morrison's rendition of a kind of Magic Realism style. Don't expect everything to be realistic: there are ghosts and half painted characters that cross our normal boundaries of time. Expect to be disoriented at the beginning, but the plot clears up as you go and then you can go back and re-read the opening chapters. A great work of literature which yields more after every reading.

This is one of the most beautiful Cuban discs out there. I was reminded of this album after listening to the new Portuonda release by BVSC -- and this one is better. Borja has a much sweeter voice and sings every memorable ballad ever on this disc. There is not a song that is not fantastic. My only complaint is the sound quality which is a bit irregular in places. Still, this should be a bestseller. Buy it if you can find it.

Parts of this book are &quot;out there.&quot; At times you may feel that you're reading a treatise on the beauty and power of &quot;rusticles.&quot; I imagine that's because the author has about 10 different scientific specialities and a wide-ranging intellect that covers every conceivable area. Though I wasn't as interested in some of the over-dramatized reactions to seeing clothing and shoes, I did love his reconstructions of events familiar to most Titanic junkies. Ever since reading Lord's book, I've been a bit of a Titanic junkie -- this book fueled my interest and corrected many false or exaggerated accounts from earlier books. A must-read for Titanic fans -- those not interested in other scientific matters can easily skip the techie sections and concentrate on the purely Titanic stuff. A worthwhile read.

I guess I came to this book through the back door -- first I read Michael Cunningham's pulitzer prize winning book The Hours (based on Mrs. Dalloway) which I LOVED, and then I decided to read the original. First off, I must say that Cunningham impressed me even more when I fully understood the references and parallels that he uses. As for Mrs. Dalloway, it is the language itself that dazzles. The plot is nothing to speak of -- it's similar to a Jane Austen book when lots of interesting and not-so-interesting people interact in their mundane lives. It's what Woolf does with the subtle interactions and her stream of conscious writing that makes this book so good. Having read maybe 6 of Woolf's works, my favorite is still To the Lighthouse. Maybe that's because Mrs. Ramsey is so much more human -- Mrs. Dalloway is always described as distant and cold. This book is a love story of sorts about how Clarissa turns down the true love of her life and instead marries a wealthy politician. Like Ulysses, the narrative jumps around the minds of various characters in their journey from morning in London when Clarissa goes to buy flours to the evening of her party. It is a bit difficult, but the language itself makes it worth the effort.

I was so excited to get this CD and even more so after looking at the beautiful design, cover, etc... That's why the disappointment was even more acute. I've played it near 10 times and it's so bland compared to other great Arabic music I've been listening to lately that I find it utterly forgettable. There are a few good songs, but for the most part they are too pop sounding and not &quot;authentic&quot; enough. I really wanted to like this CD and will keep listening, but so far I'm not impressed with the popish instrumentation and unmemorable music.

I'm a life long Joyce fan and I have to admit that I enjoyed this life of Jim's wife (only she could call him Jim!) Nora even more than I did the three volume Ellman biography of Joyce himself. In fact, Joyce fans will probably learn more about Joyce's writing by reading about his wife than about him. This is one of the most outstanding biographies I have ever read -- it's fascinating to learn how Joyce used Nora's every utterance somewhere in his works even though she herself never read Ulysses.

I've read all the great reviews of this album and I'm willing to admit it's just me, but I HATE it, really, truly. My 8 year old daughter and I listened to it at least 5-6 times to give it a chance (like when we first tried Coldplay, we didn't love it, but then it grew on us), but to the unitiated fan of classic rock, it sounds like a bunch of cheap synthesizers and really weird stuff. I didn't find it offensive, just bad. Maybe I've hit that point where I'm too old -- it sounds too techno, too much like "I wish we were Pink Floyd but we're not." And I like Hip Hop, I like some current rock (I love the White Stripes), but I am incapable of hearing what is great about this CD although Lord knows I tried.

My absolute favorite humor writer is Dave Barry, but Sedaris gives him a run for the money. His sense of humor is different than Barry's, but his ascerbic observations will have most readers howling in the aisle. One of his crasser stories, Big Boy, had me gasping for breath. Who hasn't encountered a giant turd &quot;no toilet paper or anything, just this long and coiled specimen, as thick as a burrito&quot; in a bathroom and has had to deal with it? If this kind of humor offends you, pick another book to read.His stories of trying to learn French are hilarious as well, particularly the American couple on the train who assume that Sedaris does not speak English because they are in Paris. The husband says loudly to his wife, &quot;Peeeew, can you smell that? That is pure French baby...this little froggy is ripe,&quot; referring to our narrator! Of course, he understands everything, but doesn't want to give away his English abilities until he hears what other stupid things they have to say. I also loved the final story about his immigrant father who stashed away ancient food items so that they didn't go to waste. After insisting on eating a very old carrot, his father pretends to enjoy it as the carrot, &quot;too weak to resist, quietly surrendered to the force of his jaws.&quot;Sedaris is very observant and these essays are filled with self-deprecating humor and funny tales that will keep you reading until people on the train with you with wonder what is making you laugh so uncontrollably.

I was happy to see a bestseller that wasn't a Danielle Steele romance -- this is a thinking person's bestseller. Golden has done his research -- I guarantee you'll feel like you are a geisha in training in Japan when you read the detail and nuance that Golden includes in his book. I was entranced by the writing, plot, and detail of this excellent historical novel. It's hard to belive that enough people were interested to make this a bestselling novel, although I have to say it deserves its status as such. I found it engrossing reading from first page to last with enough detail to hook even the novice reader. Finally, several years after writing the book, Golden has sold the rights to Hollywood who will undoubtedly make it a strong movie -- if done right, this could be a memorable movie. If done poorly, it will disappoint the thousands of readers who loved the book.

I hadn't read Catcher since high school until I read it again the summer before teaching it to my 9th grade honors English class. I remember loving it as a kid, but as an adult, it blew me away. As a kid, I picked up the humor, but I don't think I picked up the poignancy -- I found myself crying in many scenes: at the museum with Phoebe, when Holden dances with Phoebe while hiding in his parents' apartment, when he finds out his teacher is a pervert -- what seemed funny then is emotionally gut renching now. Suddenly it seems more obvious why Holden is depressed and how he perceives his world. He refuses to see the world through rose colored glasses; rather, he sees right down to every last fault and phony utterance. I can't believe how much better this book got over the years. If you have never read it or haven't read it recently, you owe it to yourself. I love books about schools, and this is probably the best (A Separate Peace is quite good too). For those who love New York, there is a lot of local flavor here too. If you want to know what it feels like to feel alienated as a teenager, this book is a must. Not that it's all depressing: you'll laugh out loud at some of the early scenes dealing with his roommates at prep school.

If I hadn't been lucky enough to take a college course that required The Moonstone, I would have missed reading this tremendous mystery. It's great reading through and through -- great Victorian writing, exotic characters and scenery, terrific plot, likeable characters (Sergeant Cuff and Franklin) etc... Not only that, it's an important work for those who consider themselves fans of detective fiction since many consider it the first detective novel of all time. In fact, I'd argue that it puts many modern and popular detective novels to shame. I'm amazed that Collins had such a good handle on a &quot;page turner&quot; that long ago. This is such a good mystery that it will make you want to read The Woman in White which is equally as good if not better. I have to admit that I also enjoyed the PBS version of the Moonstone as well. Don't read the abridged version -- the full version is a classic read and well worth it.

I'm glad to hear many of the students who reviewed this book say that they found it more piercing than some of the &quot;older&quot; novels they read in class. Although as a teacher I wouldn't throw aside Hawthorne for Gaines, I think this book is a terrific addition to the American classics read in middle and high school. It makes a good pairing with To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee's classic (and still as moving as ever) focuses on the trial of a black man, unfairly convicted, whereas Lesson accepts the inevitable death sentence and explores the journey towards salvation. Our narrator is the only &quot;educated&quot; person in the novel, but for all his education, he has no soul and no religious faith. After being asked to meet with Jefferson, the condemned man, to convince him that he is in fact a man, not a hog, the narrator discovers as much about himself as the prisoner. The minor cast of characters are well drawn -- the pain evident in their lives is present on ever page. We witness the indignities they suffer in the hands of the white justice system, including being forced to wait hours just to speak to the sheriff. I'm glad Gaines includes one &quot;good&quot; white man (Paul) as a gesture of good will that there are always smaller heroes among villains. The friendship between the narrator and Paul makes for an inspiring finale.This book is very moving and well-written. Highly recommended.

I'm on a McCarry roll. This is my 5th book in 7 days I've read of Mr. McCarry's and I can't stop. I didn't love the Mierknik Dossier, but Shelley's Heart is a masterwork that picks up some of the threads of The Better Angels which would be good to read first if you can. I also read some of his later Paul Christopher novels, so it was fascinating to catch up on the Hubbard family and the famous Zarah who plays such an intriguing role in this novel. What can I say? Every detail is amazing -- the political intrigue, the spy games, the Washington insiders, the social scene -- he has such a terrific eye, suspenseful writing style that you simply cannot put these books down. Of the books I've read so far, this was my favorite although I really enjoyed Second Sight and Old Boys too. I read in an interview that Overlook Press will start reissuing all his out of print books (almost all of them are out of print except his new one, Old Boys) this spring, so I can't wait to get my hands on his other books. Run and out find them!

For a one disc collection, this is probably the best place to start with Jobim. If you already are a fan, spring for the beautiful 3 CD collection The Man from Ipanema which has many more songs on it, all in an incredibly designed box set. If you like bossa nova, you must add this CD to your collection as it is a pivotal one for the whole bossa nova genre. It just keeps growing on you.

For over 10 years I have read and enjoyed Carroll's novels. Every one gives you the same sensation: things start out seemingly normal until little by little odd things start to happen. In this sense, he reminds me of Rachel Ingalls, another one of my favorite but obscure writers. Because the odd things creep up slowly, everything seems plausible until you end up in a mind-blowing fantasy world and wonder how the heck you got there! Elevators open up into other epochs, animals talk and people look strangely familiar even though you have never met them before. I have never read a Carroll novel in more than 1 sitting: once you start, you are completely hooked until the end. I can't understand why he's not one of the most famous writers in the USA -- he's very popular in Europe (lives in Vienna), but here you can barely find his books -- all his classics except a few recent ones are out of print. Do yourself a favor and read his latest one, The Marriage of Sticks, as an introduction -- it's excellent, although others are better. I love Bones of the Moon and Voices of our Shadow the most. He inspires all sorts of subversive thoughts -- in my case, Carroll makes me wish I'd stolen the public library copies I found of all his old books. Seek out all his books and let's bring Carroll back to mainstream America. He'll change how you think.

Murakami is one of my all time favorite authors. I admire his lyric style, his mood painting, his searing perceptiveness as he gets right into the human soul, and his imaginative powers. His books transport you to another time and place -- this one quality perhaps more than anything else is the sign of great literature. When I read this book, I entered Murakami's landscape of magical happenings and incredible twists and turns. It says worlds about Murakami that those who bought Sheep Chase immediately went and bought all his other books too. This one was one of my very favorites -- positively mind-altering!

I read this book in two sittings and only because I'm too old to stay up ALL night and still be productive the next day. That is to say, this is one exciting read -- I even blocked out my fear of flying as I zoned in on the absorbing story during my recent flight. I enjoyed Los Alamos, but I'm happy to say that Kanon has continued to develop as a writer -- this book is by far his best yet. Kanon does a masterful job portraying post-war Berlin around the time of the Potsdam conference and all the intrigue, scientist-chasing and frenetic behavior during the last days of the Nazi regime. I don't know if Kanon meant to tip his hat to Hemingway's Jake Barnes, but I found his Jake to be an extremely well drawn portrait of our hero-journalist. The pacing is excellent, the dialogue credible and the plot absolutely mind bending. In terms of genre, I'd put this between Le Carre, Folliet, Clancy combining the best elements. Ultimately, Kanon outdoes them all for just plain good writing. My head is still spinning from the labyrintine plot -- read this one with a friend so you can compare notes. If I could even find a small quibble, I'd say the fortune telling scene was a bit over the top and perhaps Jake's original motivation to pursue a murder mystery once he found Lena, but I was very willing to suspend any disbelief. The Good German succeeds on every level (also a very touching love story) and is already one of my very favorites from this year. Superb reading from one of the best writers out there -- don't miss it.

Somehow this was a classic I &quot;missed&quot; in high school and college. I just finished reading it yesterday and still find myself thinking about many of the beautifully rendered scenes. Others have summarized the plot -- I love the labyrinthine (Dante-esque in scope) descent from the country side into the hell of Johannisburg. As we watch the narrator weave his way in and out of the horrible living conditions, we are presented with a modern day Inferno that would have made Dante proud.The dialogue is rich and detailed and the character's well-developed. There are some gut wrenchingly scenes between a father and his son, not to mention between his other siblings as well. Bitter disappointments, difficult circumstances and a trial that makes To Kill a Mockingbird's look fair add to the book's tension. Overall, a lyrical and stirring portrait of unfairness and oppression (but also beauty and purity) in South Africa and one family's trials and tribulations. It makes one wonder how much things have really changed from Paton's day.

I don't want to take pot shots at some of the smaller flaws (Rachel's narration, some of the shoddy narration for the first quarter or so of the book, an overwhelming amount of Kingsolver's political analysis) because overall I was very impressed with the book. It's been a while since I've read such an ambitious book with such an epic scope, so I have to hand it to Kingsolver who did spend 20 years doing the research. If anything, the sheer heft of the book gets in the way -- the first 100 pages are SLOW -- then the narrative picks up. After hundreds of pages, we have an abrupt transformation to post Africa and what each child is doing. The last 100 pages or so are not nearly as vivid as the middle. A bit anticlimatic in fact. She's best when she's describing day to day routines and behaviors -- not as good when she's adding her political views.Despite some flaws, it's quite an accomplished book in lots of ways, especially the creation of such memorable characters like Adah and Nathan. At least it's a &quot;pop&quot; book that has some depth and texture. Those who rip it apart should try some Richard Paul Evans first and then go back to appreciate Kingsolver's enormous tapestry.

Although this may not be the masterpiece of 20th literature, I have to admit that it was a very absorbing read. As we follow Charly, the well-bred perfect English gentlemen, through his week long vacation in Paris, we become ensnared in the life story of the prostitute he befriends and her web of friends and acquaintances. The story itself is interesting in its own right, but what really makes the narrative flow is how Maugham lets us peer into the psyches of various characters, all from different social strata. My personal favorite was Berger, Lydia's husband who despite his rogue behavior was one of the more memorable (and even likable) characters. Simon, Charly's friend was drawn perhaps a bit too extremely, but Maugham does use that to some effect. In any case, a fun read and a good story.

Just as I enjoy armchair travelling for its budget price, I like armchair wine books. Not all of us can afford to drink great wine daily, but it's fine to read about it and to heighten your appreciation when you do get the chance to try a great wine. This book is very easy to follow and does an especially great job on the various grape types (varietals) from gamay to nebbiolo and everything in between. It should answer almost anyone's basic questions about grapes and how wine is made. The flavor wheels and food charts are very helpful as are the regional breakdowns that make up part 3. I happen to like this breezy style, but if you want a stuffy wine book, don't buy this one. Our fearless author sticks in lots of his opinions, but in a way that makes us believe him.For the novice (and even for the expert who needs some brushing up), this is an easy to follow and helpful guide to a world of wine.

I think I've read and reread this novel over 15 times through my own reading and teaching English. It's a key novel for any reading course because more than any other Hemingway novel, it's a book that teaches you how to read. Sure, his dialogue is inspired, his descriptions lean and elegant, but the genius of Hemingway lies in the silences and the gestures. What could say more than &quot;he looked down&quot; when Montoya realizes that Jake has betrayed him to Romero? Or when Jake squeezes Brett's hand in the car? This is the key to Hemingway's genius. In the honors 9th grade class I taught 2 years ago, 22 of my students voted it their favorite novel of the year (we read perhaps 7) by a landslide. It's not as easy a book as you would think, but it bears repeated reading and study. For my money, I think it's the greatest thing Hemingway ever wrote except perhaps some of his short stories like Indian Camp (which you should read for the great gesture of all time: he rolled over). When you read the story, you'll understand how it's the most important line, but one that's easy to miss.

The author is a self-avowed golden nut who worships her dogs and lets them sleep in her bed (not as puppies though -- only after her dominance as the alpha dog is gained!). Every owner should have to read this before getting a puppy. Too many people think of puppies as cute little furballs but give little attention to their training. Even these adorable little dogs need strict training and discipline so they can rise to their best behavioral level. You'll learn all the things you SHOULD do to train your dog and many that you shouldn't like rubbing its nose in feces (who ever thought of that!). Obviously, some dog owners must be a bit daft. Do yourself a favor and read this book before committing to raising a puppy. No one should get a puppy unless they are prepared to work at being a good trainer. Even this forgiving and friendly breed needs structure.

The excellent Common Reader catalogue has been recommending this book forever in their catalogue and I can see why -- once you start, you can't put it down. Much like the other great survival tale, The Long Walk (which was probably even a notch above this one for sheer duration of suffering over multiple terrains with even worse odds of survival), this book follows the inredible suffering of a Norwegian hero who set sail from England on a Nazi raid in the northernmost regions of Norway. As usual, the Norwegians come out looking like real heroes -- just as they resisted Nazi occupation and didn't lie down to the treat of Hitler, so too many ordinary Norwegians risked their own lives and those of their families to save the young protagonist from sure death. A terrific read from start to finish!

This is the first book I've read of his -- it sounds like it's worth checking out his Pulizter prize winning stories. Butler does an excellent job of evoking the sights and smells of Vietnam from the perspective of a vet who returns to find out more about himself. The narrative flows from Ben's point of view to his lover's -- the technique seemed heavy handed at times, seamless at others. Images flow freely as they fall in love and try to consummate their passion -- but the past's secrets seem to be invading. The conclusion seems too much to be believed, but I'm not sure it matters that much. This is a mood novel, and as such, it was a good read. You'll feel like you know what it feels like to be in Vietnam under this time and circumstance. Very nicely done overall with some well-drawn portraits of two characters.

I simply could not put this book down. I stayed up until the wee hours following Lance's childhood adventures, his preliminary successes, his youthful brashness, his discovery and struggle with testicular cancer and his long road to recovery. Every part of the narrative is gripping -- his struggle with cancer (he was one of the most severe cases the doctors had ever seen) is brutally described from the chemo "poison" to the horrible catheter which practically became a part of his body. Although he doesn't lionize himself, his struggle and conquest has to be an inspiration for all who have suffered with the disease. I love biking too (although for me an hour is a long ride -- Lance says real bikers don't bother to take out there bikes if it's for under 5 hours) so I loved the descriptions of his training and races, particularly his focus on climbing mountain after mountain in the freezing rain to prepare for the Tour de France.In short, this book will give anyone an appreciation for athletic endeavors, but more important for the human spirit. We are spared no details of the medical horrors - a soberting account. Plus, I worship his wife Kik after reading how she dealt with all the various moves and life events. She's even more of a hero at times than Mr. Armstrong proving the maxim that behind every great man is a great woman.

Berg has done it again -- she has the uncanny ability to capture the inner thoughts of women (in this case, girls) at their most vulnerable. From her gorgeous (but addicted to shoplifting) friend to another friend's overbearing mother, our young narrator captures perfectly the confusion and pain of growing up female. She develops a crush on the handsome gas station attendent who rescues her one day after she falls into the ice and thinks of him even as she has uncomfortable sexual experiences at a drive in movie with her popular friend. Even the lesser characters are well drawn: her friend Cynthia's mother and grandmother, Jimmy and Taylor. Although young teens would love this book (I think it would make them feel that others go through many of these issues), I think the real audience is adults who remember the pain of these years as though it were yesterday. Very touching and affecting.

Unlike many of the long and ponderous books I've read, this slender volume manages to hit all the key points that web masters should know to increase search engine placement. Easy to read, concise and direct -- all you need to know in 60 minutes or less. Though there is not much text, what is here is the meat and potatoes of what you need to know. On top of giving a good overview of how search engines work, this book focuses on practical advice for increasing web traffic.If you're starting a web site or if you just want to keep tabs on your web master, I'd highly recommend this short volume. Well written too.

I was drawn in my all the amazing reviews of this book. For the most part, Pavic lived up to the reviews -- this is a clever meta-critical look at philosophy, religion and novel writing by an astute author. You may not understand every word, but I think any good reader will pick up the majority of this book -- a challenging yet worthwhile book. I have to admit that I only read the female version and I'm a little skeptical about what difference the male version may hold, but I'd still recommend the book to all readers who enjoy texts from other cultures.

I've been a U2 fan from the beginning and have all their albums but Pop, but this is still the best overall. Sure, the big name songs are great, but the truth is, there is not one filler song on the album. My personal favorites on this album are Running to Stand Still and Mothers of the Disappeared (okay, and Trip through your Wire). Their newest album comes closest to the atmosphere on Joshua Tree although it's still just a tad shy of the greatness this achieved. I can still remember the excitement when it first was released (I was DJing in college at the time). I love Boy and October too, but as an album, this is amazing music from the first track to the last. If you are just coming back to U2, please buy this album and not the greatest hits. Each album has a special energy and atmosphere that is lost on a greatest hits album, especially with U2. Go the exta mile and buy the albums themselves. This one has many of their best hits anyway.

I was completely hooked after reading the first book in the series -- I'll never forget the innovative descriptions of quiddich, the Hogwarts School, the magic wand selection and the hat sorting. After the magic and inspiration of the first book, I found this book just a tad disappointing, and I mean JUST a tad. Still, it's great stuff and I recommend it because you'll need the plotline before reading the 3rd one in the series which was just excellent. I can't wait until my 3 year old is old enough to understand the whole series. Even though I loved Beowolf, I still think Rowling deserved the Whitbread Prize as hers was an original work, not a translation.

I've been on somewhat of an adventure mode lately with all the Shackleton books, modern sailing travels and rescues, Everest, etc...., but this one is worth reading because Slocum was one of the &quot;original&quot; adventurers. He took a very small boat and made it seaworthy -- it's interesting to note that he felt so comfortable on the boat that he never shows fear, not even as he rounds the Horn or passes through major storms. He downplays his skill, but with little more than dead reckoning, he manages to find little islands in the middle of the Pacific and never fears getting lost. After his first wife died, he didn't feel happy on land, so he set off to sail around the globe which takes him 3 years. Particularly interesting are all the ports of call and how he is treated in each one. In the late 19th century, there was great interest in his trip and usually he was greated with fanfare. In this well-written and adventure filled travelogue, he recounts his travels and the details of his trip around the world with many interesting stops along the way. A great read.

...My question is, do you have to like a character to like the book? I don't think so -- think of all the great villians (Iago,...) we love to hate. These characters are not likeable -- they are sad, fashion obsessed freeloaders who have no talents or drive. But, that is part of the fabric of the novel which aims to create an almost surrealistic portrait of these pathetic characters as they struggle along in their own little world.That's what makes the book so terrifically funny! The characters take themselves oh-so-seriously, but we don't have to. With that being said, I really enjoyed all the novellas in this collection. I have not read or watched Sex in the City, so I can only consider this book on its own. The story about the &quot;princess&quot; was priceless -- she's so &quot;on&quot; with her portraits of label-toting egoists that you'd feel at home if you met them. The first story about the Hamptons is excellent as well. Especially if you are familiar with New York, this collection will be enjoyable. I wonder if they were all real blonde or not....

As I read these two sister's enthusiastic descriptions of a number of national parks, I found myself forgetting that they were only kids. I'm a habitual reader of travel guides (otherwise known as the armchair traveler), so I feel qualified to say that this one is very refreshing. In fact, if you're thinking of travelling with your kids to any national park, you should pick up this book so you can see what it's like from their point of view. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with park rangers who treated their thoughtful questions very seriously and added a needed perspective on many parks. I'm impressed that two young kids were able to put together such a professional book -- I can only imagine what their next project will be!

I'm surprised at the hostility towards Morrison's first novel. I've read and taught almost all her later novels (Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved) which are much better, but it's worth reading the Bluest Eye to see where Morrison has come from and where she was going. In fact, it's one of the more interesting projects for any author/s: read their later masterpieces and then go back and read their very first published work. One can at least see the power of her writing and her vivid descriptions which come back in a much more mature form in Beloved. Morrison has grown a lot since 1970, and if you read her own feelings about the novel (posted in the critical reviews), you'll see that she herself would probably only give 2-3 stars to this book. Still, as an early novella and certainly her most accessible book, read it as an introduction to her later and better works.

This book is a readable account of the history of math from ancient times down to the 20th century. I particulary liked the history of Greek math and then Indian and Arab math -- those chapters were especially well done. It's amazing that not much happened mathematically speaking until practically the renaissance -- the burning of the library of Alexandria really held up most signficant developments. The other terrific chapters were on Newton and Leibnitz, plus all the French and Italian mathematicians like LaPlace and Legrange. I sometimes wished for a bit more biographical anecdotes, but the author covers hundreds of mathematicians. My only small gripe is that he quotes extensive sections in Latin and French with no translation as if we all have a perfect reading knowledge of these languages, even the 16th century versions complete with archaic terms. Still, this book is a good reference and overview of major math developments. I had some trouble following all the math, but I'm not a mathematician either.

It sounds trite to call the work a masterpiece, but once you study the poem, it's easy to see how its richness lies in the details. Homer (or the collection of poets called Homer -- no one is still quite sure) recounts the last year of the Trojan War, but makes every line count with incredible heroic/epic similies, memorable epitets, and detail worthy of a great master. What makes the poem enjoyable though is the humanness of its heros -- no one who's read the poem can forget the image of the great Hektor going out to battle who scares his tiny son to death with his helmet. Homer lets us inside Troy to see their families, their women, their children, their culture -- and the Trojans were the enemy! Sure, there are many long battle scenes and formulaic parts, but it's worth reading through them to get to the great passages. If you've not read Homer before, read a simple overview of the Judgement of Paris and the Trojan War (D'Aulair's Greek Mythology is very simple and easy to follow) and buy a guide like the Twayne's Masterworks or Bloom's Notes. Remember, the ancient listeners already knew the plot, so you're not cheating if you read the basic plot before reading the chapter itself. You're just doing as the Romans, er, Greeks do. In this case, I'd recommend the Lattimore since it's by far the closest to the dactylic hexameter of the Greek -- he really hits the nail on the head in this translation.

The author's spare style is reminscent of Camus. He doesn't need to overwrite to create a lot of ambience and intense emotion. At first, I was worried that he would dwell on the love affair between the 15 year old Michael and Hanna. But, it turns out that those descriptions are among the best in the novel and their affair somehow never touches the sordid depths of Lolita's life. The narrator spends his whole life trying to equal or surpass this first and most pure of his relationships. I enjoyed how the narrator described his new manner with girls his age thanks to his experiences with Hanna. I agree with other readers below that the so called &quot;secret&quot; was way too obvious. I figured it out right after Michael left her the note, but then thought to myself, but how could that account for all her strangeness? I must say that the twists the novel takes make it a very interesting novel -- we pass through WWII and the Holocaust, but in a much different manner than we normally do in this type of genre.It's quite a short book (took maybe 2 hours to read), but because of the compelling narrator and the lean prose, I really enjoyed it. It's a cerebral book -- we feel the narrator's pain as he tries to get over his early affair and regroup -- whether he ever gets it together or not I will leave as a surprise.

It's a shame this book is out of print because there are thousands of devoted Jeopardy! watchers who would really enjoy this book. Not only does it trace the origins of the game (Merv Griffin's inspiration) and its history, it gives tons of tips that would be of use to a potential player. The biggest difference between the old game (with Art Fleming) and the new game is that in the old days, you could ring in anytime, so fast readers were rewarded. Now, you must wait until Alex finishes the question before you can ring in. That changed the game's dynamics quite a bit. There are virtually thousands of interesting tidbits within these pages: why it's impossible to cram, why men tend to be better at it than women, why it's so hard to get on the show even if you do well on the test, why contestants in second or third place no longer get to keep their money, etc... The book even includes sample Jeopardy! boards from popular categories. Even if you can't buy a copy of this book, I know it's available in many public libraries since it was published about 10 years ago. I highly recommend it to Jeopardy! fans. It definitely gives you an appreciation for even the losing players since it is much harder than you might think to play and play well.

I've had a long running interest in language acquisition and the study of linguistics, and have read many of the original works by authors like Chomsky. What Pinker does, whether you agree with his conclusions or not, is to provide an excellent general overview of linguistic theories. Many linguistic texts are DULL or tortuously difficult to read. Pinker is very clear and writes quite well. He sometimes goes a bit overboard on his theory, but most of the time he's very convincing. I have not yet read the other book referred to below, but look forward to it.

I think MacMillan is a terrifically entertaining writer. Her dialogue is hilarious and her characters, though sometimes a bit clueless, are certainly endearing. I find this book deeper than How Stella got Her Groove back, but don't expect Dickens. She's a sharp writer with a good eye for detail and dialogue who presents a fine portrait of upper middle class black women. As I said in my review of Stella, it's nice to see a positive economic/social representation of black women for a change rather than the cliched drug dealers and basketball players. These women are successful financially and are working on their social lives. She makes me laugh out loud at times thanks to her great sense of humor

This is certainly not a pleasant book to read. Nothing very good happens to our 6 year old narrator as he goes from gypsy village to gypsy village and witnesses one thing more horrible than the next. There are some absolutely horrifyingly graphic, disgusting shows of man's brutality but you almost becomed numbed by reading it. By the time you hit the seen with the invaders at the end who rape and torture the women, it doesn't even seem as bad as half of the other stuff. More importantly, you can see how the boy cannot go back to living with his family now that his childhood is lost. An important book although don't expect any fun here.For my taste, I prefer the gut renching agony of Primo Levi's Holocaust memoirs and novels. At times you forget you are reading about humans since the behavior borders on primate like. I'm not sure mankind has improved that much in the intervening time between the close of WW II and the present. This is kind of like reading a Lord of the Flies with eastern European gypsies and villagers.

For my money, this should be toy of the year. Don't shy away from it if you have younger kids -- my 4 year old LOVES it and has memorized lots of the information already that comes in the standard book (the states, instruments, etc....). It's really cool! Plus, it's very portable, great for the car, great to teach reading and just neat. I think it's fun to play with too. As your child gets older, you can buy more advanced books and your child can use the magic pen to sound out difficult words. For younger kids, they'll want to point at everything. I bought the leap frog PRO at my local store which is the best platform to get if you're going to buy several books. It comes with The Secret Garden which is a bit too advanced for age 4. I'm about to buy more books. Makes a great educational gift.

First off, this really is more of a novella or short story. It should take most readers under an hour and there's not much to focus on. The period detail consists of a hat shop and a few mentions of WWI and trenches. That's about it. If you want a New York period piece, try Jack Finney's Time and Again. I just read this and Richard Paul Evan's latest book in the same two day span. They both share a nice story, simple plot and two dimensional characters with sketchy love stories. Pretty blah. If you want to see the difference, pick up the work of a great writer -- I just started Philip Roth's The Human Stain and its writing alone blows these fluffy books away. If not for her name, I don't think any publisher would have jumped at this run-of-the-mill story. I enjoyed the book, but it was not a work of art. Stick to the Mansfield story it was based on.

Unlike the majority of reviewers listed here, I know next to nothing about rap or hip-hop so I can't talk about how well they rap or scratch. I listen to mostly classical, jazz and international music but I bought this album based on other reviewers' high opinion of it. I was not disappointed. One thing I can tell you is that the DJ's are so clever with their wordplay and their beats that you'll want to play this one over and over. Even my 4 year old thinks it's a great listen because of the rhythms, rhymes and the beat. Because they make an effort to harmonize, the music is not brash or harsh. Much to my surprise, I love this album. The samples from classic Jazz records made my day too.

Maybe I shouldn't say that about airplanes because the gripping first 150 pages are likely to make one think twice about flying. I'd say the first part of DeMille's latest is excellent and the dialogue is great throughout, but the plot does seem rather mundane and predictable and the book could have easily been 200 pages trimmer. The ending is too reminscent of a cheap movie announcing the sequel before the final credits scroll by. Still, I was definitely entertained and would still keep reading DeMille's books. The Charm School is by far his best book to date -- if he'd pare down the length and come up with a less stereotypical plot, he'd be better off. A great beach book though and a page turner despite my small gripes.

This is a terrific book for anyone who aspires to run or lead a business. Dell writes entertainingly about his childhood adventures -- not many teenagers were enterprising enough to research how to find all newly married couples and all people who took out mortgages in order to sell newspaper subscriptions! He was making an annual salary higher than most of his teachers just from his summer activities. His parents should have known they were in for trouble. The first part of the book is devoted to how he founded his business with $1000 of start up money and then all the ups, downs, and mistakes they made along the way. It is encouraging to read that it's not the mistakes that matter, but how quickly you acknowledge and address them that count.The second part of the book has tremendously practical advice for almost any company. Why make the same mistakes that you could avoid by following his model for success? I daresay there is enough solid information here for any informed person to put into practice what Dell did to make a successful business. After having read a series of books on leadership, I can say that this is one of the most practical and hands-on ones as well as one of the most interesting.

Don't expect one of Saramago's heavy books like Blindness or The Stone Raft. This is a short novella that takes about 10 minutes to read. It's a fairy tale that works on several levels, as do just about all of his works. The opening sequence hooks the reader with the proverbial peasant knocking on the king's door asking for a boat. Finally, after 3 days, the king does not know how to put off his request anymore and grants him a modest boat. The king's cleaning lady flees the castle to accompany the dreamer on his quest to discover an unknown island. Up to this point, I was with him. Then the narrative becomes somewhat dragged into a surreal sleeping/dreaming scene that ends in a somewhat ambiguous way (and I wouldn't dream of spoiling the ending). The first half was considerably better than the second half although I always enjoy Saramago's writing style. It reminds me at times of Faulkner, at least in terms of his flowing sentences and stream of consciousness. But, considering this will only take 10-20 minutes of your day, I recommend it as a good introduction to Saramago's longer works. I've only read Blindess and The Stone Raft so far, but I'm trying to get to his others.

I've always liked Bellow's books. I did enjoy the first half or so of Ravelstein who appears bigger than life. I think the best scene in the book is right after he buys his Lanvin jacket for $4500 in Paris and immediately spills expresso all over it. Rather than being horrified, he finds it kind of funny, much to the narrator's chagrin. The characterization of Ravelstein is excellent and quite funny in parts, but once they leave Paris and return to the midwest, things drag a bit. The book is not heavy on plot to begin with, but the second half is mostly the recounting of various illnesses. There are too many random academic tirades, too many inserted scenes and too many unconnected events to make this is a great novel. Still, Bellow is very &quot;on&quot; in parts and nails his recreation of Harold Bloom on the head. Worth reading, but ultimately, not one of Bellow's very best.

I read this book on a vacation and found it to be a page turner. I loved the atmosphere, the gypsy elements, the police procedure at the turn of the century and some of the characters. However, I spent some time pouring over the book after I finished and found many holes. First of all, the first major section of the book is about the fig (which is quite well done), but this turns out to be the biggest loose end around -- when we FINALLY find the tree, what is the relevance? how does it implicate the murderer? In fact, there are many scenes that are well described that turn out to have NOTHING to do with the plot. In short, there are many nice set pieces, but the storytelling does not hold together as many reviewers have pointed out. I enjoyed the book, but as a real detective story, it is lacking. too much pedantic research, not enough hard info to dig our teeth into. Still a good read, but not a masterwork.

I've only read Archer's novels, not his short stories, so I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness of these stories. The reviewer who called them &quot;O Henry-esque&quot; is on target. All these stories contain stunning reversals or trick endings that will keep you guessing. I loved The Endgame especially. Most of the stories are short, well-conceived and well-executed. The tale of two pub friends who trade off roles in their lawyer/expert witness routine is hilarious. In fact, Archer's droll wit is apparent on just about every page. I thought 3-4 of the stories were terrific, but even the &quot;sub-par&quot; ones I found enjoyable. I read the whole book in one sitting. Most readers of this kind of surprise short story should find these diabolically clever and suspenseful. Sure, you may guess one or two of the endings, but overall Archer will remain a step ahead.

Even younger children can improve their concentration by trying to fit all these pieces in the correct slots. I thought my 4 year old would be discouraged by the time running out, but actually most kids think it's fun when the pieces explode, even if that means they are &quot;losing.&quot; By helping your kids the first few times and then letting them try it seems to be the best way to get them interested. I still found it as much fun as it was when I was young. Probably best for 5 and up, but even younger kids will enjoy trying to fit the pieces in. If you don't want the &quot;stress&quot; for little kids, just have them put the pieces in without pushing down the board and using the timer!

I found the book's structure a bit disjointing. I didn't like the way the chapters broke up the storyline between the lock of hair's journey and Beethoven's life. I'd already read a fair amount about Beethoven's irascible personality and chronically bad health, so I didn't find much that was new or interesting. The part of the book I enjoyed the most was the amazing story of the Danish people who were so valiant in their effort to save Jews from the Gestapo. No matter how much you read about these events, they always make a big impact. I don't think any nation was as heroic in the face of the Nazis as the Danes. While the story of the hair was interesting, I just didn't think the book as a whole held together very well. An interesting idea, but a bit disappointing overall from my perspective.

The nice thing about the hungry hippo game is that you don't even have to say that anyone &quot;wins&quot; or not -- I tell my daughter that her hippos must have been REALLY hungry if they eat more marbles than my hippos. This game works best if all 4 hippos are in action gobbling marbles (or else the marbles get stuck), but two people can easily operate two hippos, even young children. The hardest part about this game were the assembly directions of how to insert the cheap plastic marble flippers. It only takes two seconds once you figure it out, but be sure to just look at the picture on the box, not the damned directions which make it sound like a real production.The game itself is easy to play, makes a good amount of noise (as the hippo heads knock the plastic) and entertains for long periods of time. It's a silly game, but it does promote counting marbles to see who wins.

I am always skeptical of collections, but I have to admit that Putamayo has not disappointed me with any of their CDs (I own 4 of them). Cuban music is one of my favorite genres, so I was expecting to tear this apart, but in fact it's a very authentic collection with a good selection of different Cuban styles. Every track is excellent, but my all time favorite is the first one. If you have like the Buena Vista collection, run, don't walk to pick this one up too and it will surpass your expectations.

As a longtime fan of Bryson, I can say that this book has all the components that make his books good (humor, history, background information, insights), but as a whole, it doesn't hold up to his other books. Yes, there are many great stories from his trip through Australia and you will also learn more than you ever wanted to know about everything from poisonous critters to beer brands and temperatures. But, at some point, the narrative simply drags and you'll find yourself asking if you wanted to relive every single moment of this long trip. I've walked the Appalachian trail with Mr. Bryson, read his accounts of the English language, etc..., but never have I gotten to the point where I was actually bored and looking to see how many pages I had to slog through.Perhaps if you are incredibly fascinated by Australia and its history, you won't find it slow going in parts. Bryson is still one of my favorite travel/humor writers, but this is definitely not his best book.

Unlike everyone else in the world, I'm not enamored with tenors. Give me a rich baritone anyday. Nathan Gunn is a baritone god. I've seen him perform live at the MET and he is even more amazing in person because he can actually act and doesn't weight 400 pounds. I was thrilled to find that he had released a CD of American songs which are an excellent outlet for his voice. You can really hear his sweet tone as he pours his heart into these beautiful songs, both classics and some new original compositions by Gene Sheer.After hearing him belt out Brother Can You Spare a Dime and croon Shenandoah, I was hooked. I'm not a big ragtime fan, but the ballads are to die for. This is a terrific collection of songs by one of the best baritones in the world today. If you think I'm exaggerating, listen for yourself. I've played it 3 times today and might have to listen one more time before I break myself away. There's even some great comic touches like Murray the Furrier. A true 5 star recording and the price can't be beat.

Perfume remains one of my all time favorite novels. This is one of the rare times that a runaway bestseller is actually a great work of literature also. Suskind is so tremendously innovative in both his ideas and his writing. You will not be able to put this book down from the opening pages which are haunting. The reader begins to inhabit the mind of a madman who is controlled by his lupine sense of smell. The Butcher Boy by Patrick McCabe gives a similar feeling. Suskind gets everything right -- the pacing is excellent, his writing exquisite and a chilling plot that will leave you hungry for more.

At first I was embarrassed to be in my thirties and reading these books in public, but that's before I became hooked. I read this last one on an airplane trip and I was so absorbed that the plane could have crashed and I wouldn't have noticed. It's hard to imagine that these books keep getting better, but they do! With such great villains as Draco and Sirius Black, and even more quiddich playing, how could you go wrong. Adults need not be ashamed -- run out, read these books and regain your childhood imagination. This was my favorite of the first 3 books.

In this genre of rescue/adventure books, Maas is better than most. He uses his reporterial skills to set the time and place in America very well. Like The Perfect Storm, we find out a bit about the sailors' backgrounds and families before the disaster unfolds. What impressed me the most was the sailors' poise and control during the whole ordeal. In an effort to conserve oxygen, they mostly just hunkered down and tried not to freeze to death. No one complained or even talked excessively.The real hero of the story is of course Monson who fought against navel bureuracy for years to come up with a unit to rescue fallen submariners. His &quot;lung&quot; and his &quot;bell&quot; were the two inventions that changed maritime history. The incredible bravery of both he and his divers is evident. The depressing part is that this remarkable man ends up dying of cancer. How does this happen to such a heroic figure? The pace is excellent, the details vivid in this page turner. The ending seems somewhat anti-climactic once the rescue is over, but that's only a minor gripe. Well-done.

Anyone who thinks that it's sexist to clean house needs to get a life. In fact, men can feel free to follow any of Mendelson's plans too because the book does not necessarily direct every comment to women. I couldn't get over how much research went into this book -- the author must have spent years writing and polishing this work. Whether or not you agree with her philosophy, this book is indispensible as a reference work on everything to do with the house: cooking, cleaning, removing tough stains, organizing a weekly schedule, etc... I have to admit that I read it straight through, not just as a reference, and found almost all of it engrossing. I like the idea that keeping house should be an art, or at least a priority in our busy lives. Couples will certainly feel more grounded after reading this book and internalizing some of its ideas. A great house-warming present!

I read this book after just having finished the second volume, Theodore Rex. Maybe it's my lack of interest in politics, but I really enjoyed this volume more than the second. Maybe it's just that Teddy's early life is the stuff legends are made of -- a sickly, pale, weak kid who through his own efforts (bodybuilding) becomes one of the most athletic and fearsome outdoorsman of all time -- his tramps in the wilderness are legendary. Plus, the volume details his Harvard days and his love life, two subjects of interest to just about anyone. The story of his short but passionate marriage to his first wife and then his second marriage after her death makes up a good part of this volume. The second volume focuses on Roosevelt's presidency, while this volume focuses on his childhood, love of the outdoors, rise to political power and family life. For me, the subjects of this first volume made this a quick and memorable read.

You will definitely find out just about anything you wanted to know about mortgages: fixed and ARM (all the others are variations on these themes). My only small complaint is the same as the reviewer's below: several times the authors refer to appendices that are not there! There are also some typos (&quot;suprised&quot;) some in prominent places -- it just gave me the feeling that the book was rushed. One piece of information I felt they could have spent more time on was the mechanical side of paying down a 30 mortgage faster. For example, how many years does it take off your loan to put in one extra payment a year, or $100 per month, etc.... Home buyers often pick a 30 year mortgage because of the low monthly payment, but can strive to put in an extra payment a year to save tens of thousands of dollars of interest. This information would have given more details to the types of mortgages most people get. The authors spent a bit too much time by comparison on some relatively rare loans (reverse mortgages) although no one will put a gun to your head and make you read those parts. Overall, it was easy to follow and the best of the books on understanding how mortgages work and how to compare them.

Maybe I'm being picky, but with so much good modern fiction, I just didn't think this book was that special. The writing was excellent and many of the stories were engaging, but they began to feel a bit formulaic after awhile. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by pointing out the similarity to writing workshop stories. I'd take T. Coraghessian Boyle any day over her although since the book is short I didn't feel sorry I read it. In this same genre, I thought the Pakistani Funny Boy was even more compelling.

Eco is one of the greatest living writers in any language. Still, because of his erudition, many of his works are only accessible to scholars. I really enjoyed Foucault's Pendulum as a great science/mystery/suspense thriller, but not all readers will be as patient. If you can sift through his difficult allusions and references, you will be richly rewarded, but no one said Eco's books were easy reading. You're IQ will rise 5-10 points after reading any of Eco's books.

This is one terrific book (and only the first of the trilogy). Unlike the reviewer below who advised to read it in small segments, I couldn't put it down and read it in two sittings. From the riveting beginning when a snowball (spiked by a rock) hits Mrs. Dempster, the plot branches out to cover many interesting characters in the small town of Deptford in Canada. As you get to know the strange childhoods of Paul Dempster (born prematurely thanks to the snowball's strike on his mother), the local rich kid and a myriad of others, all seen through the eyes of our narrator Dunsten Ramsey, you'll find yourself hooked. The trilogy is structured around one basic question: Who killed Boy Staunton. You'll be amazed to find out how you could be riveted for the entire 800+pages of the trilogy as layers upon layers give way to the answer. Davies is a great writer and this book is an amazing yarn spun over this page turning trilogy.

I felt exactly the same disappointment that Renoir in her below review felt in reading this book. To be sure, there was some lyric writing, but most of it was buried under piles of boring plot line and sloppy writing. Maybe if you've never read a great piece of literature before you'd be confused into thinking that it's a modern day Odyssey, but my advice to all but the most hard core devotees of slow moving books is to pick up the Odyssey instead. About half way through this book, I realized that I didn't care whether the main character made it home or not. I love Southern writing (like Faulkner, for example), but there are many masters who do a much better job than Frazier.

I'm not a horse person and knew almost nothing about horses or racing, but I could not put this book down. What a gripping tale from the rise of an obscure horse trainer to the grueling trade of being a jockey. Of course the best characters are the horses themselves: Seabiscuit of course, the real hero, but all the other ones too like War Admiral. The central account of the story is the famous race between Seabiscuit and War admiral, but everything leading up to it is spectacular as well. The author's research was very thorough and her ability to flesh out the characters impressive. I wasn't bothered by her prose at all as some have been. I was hooked from page one right to the final pages. A terrific retelling of an age gone by.

It's pretty clear that Les embellished or invented many of these stories from the guffaws and proddings of various admirerers, but still, these stories make for entertaining reading. I was less excited about the &quot;coming to terms&quot; aspects of the story as narrated by Hillary and her husband, but that's a minor gripe. The stories sound authentic or at least are in keeping with what Hemingway WOULD have done had he been there. So even if no one could prove Hemingway went to India, the snake/tiger story is still a heck of a tale.I read it on a plane in under 2 hours and it goes by fast. Not as elegant as Hemingway's actual novels, but good fodder for the enthusiast.

I did enjoy many parts of this account of the author's adventures hitchhiking (and driving with his photographer) across the U.S. I have a few criticisms though: 1 -- he spends chapters talking about the great photos the photographer is supposedly taking, but the photo section only has a measly 13! What happened to all the photos????? 2 -- there are many grammatical and typographical mistakes. In fact, the reader before me must have been bothered because he/she circled all of them. 3 -- after a while, it is easy to lose interest in his account. I'm not trying to nitpick, as I did like the author's dry wit and detailed recounting of American cities and sights. However, this book is definitely not as interesting as many other travel/adventure books I've read. It doesn't try to be pretentious or draw grand conclusions about life (thank goodness) which makes it more palatable, but it's still not a great travel book. The prose kind of dries up in the second half.

I guess this is Polar exploration week for me since I just read this volume right after the American Museum book on the Shackleton side of the expedition. This book reads very much the same as that one: a terse day by day recount of the horrible deprivations these brave men suffered, all to lay down a supply depot for Shackleton were he to actually make it across the continent. Of course most readers know already that Shackleton's side was a disaster that resulted in his boat being crushed, long months floating on ice floes and then an incredible open ocean journey to St. Georgia island.The amazing part of this book is that the men were so willing to lay down their lives for Shackleton -- he goes down in the books as one of the all time great leaders. A shame he died of a heart attack at only age 48. He inspired incredible feats of courage. I thought the most moving part of this book had to do with how Wells compassionately took care of two invalids (advanced stages of scurvey) for months on end with nary a complaint. Well written and well-paced account that any fan of an adventure story will want to read.

This gem of a book will give you all you need to know about investing that would take over a year to learn in college/graduate courses. It also shows you that the beauty of our system is that individuals have the power in their hands to educate themselves and do at least as well if not better than the high paid Wall Street gurus. I always thought this kind of stock analysis was beyond me, but their step by step explanations make learning almost fun. Plus, you'll learn how Wall Street guys make all their money ripping people like us off (okay, I'm sure there are some honest blokes out there....). The point is, we are all capable if we invest a small amount of time. The writing is breezy and easy to follow (with lots of good humor packed in) and the subject matter endlessly fascinating. The appendices give you all the &quot;idiots&quot; stuff that you think you know but probably don't -- a kind of A-Z of stocks. It will also motivate readers to go online and find lots of this information. Highly recommended.

I loved this book. I found myself cheering from the very beginning on the mere prospect that a so-called &quot;useless&quot; major like English could lead to such productive discoveries. Mr. Foster will be the first to say that he got into the field of &quot;attributive science&quot; by accident and that he does NOT simply plug things into a computer. Rather, he uses verbal clues (for example -- I don't put a space before my parenthesis, but I always to for my double dashes), grammar, syntax, vocabulary analysis and even the process of word formation to examine the verbal fingerprint we all leave. My favorite chapter happened to be the analysis of Joe Klein's Anonymous. After you read Foster's dissection of Klein's prose, you will see that it is crystal clear that he was the author of anonymous. The amazing part is how long Klein denied it and the big wigs he roped in to cover for him (my opinion of Dan Rather has dropped a few notches).The chapters on the Unabomber, Lewinsky and the Shakespeare poem were all excellent as well -- spell-binding really. As my only small criticism, I thought the last chapter on Twas the Night Before Christmas was a bit more detailed than it needed to be. That being said, Foster is a terrific writer -- this turned out to be one of my favorite books of the year. Coming from an English background myself, I found myself rooting for the underdog English prof who was constantly being doubted for his analysis. On top of being a great writer, he's very funny as well. His dry humor and summary of how he was treated by the Oxford Press and their peers was worth the price of admission. Don't miss this literary detective story!

Having read about 6 leadership books in a row, I can say with this limited perspective that this is the best overall. These are great essays by a wide variety of major leaders -- every person has something significant to say about leadership and taken together, the reader can put together a detailed and rich picture about what makes a real leader. One encouraging thought is that great leaders benefit by having and creating other leaders -- no need to fear too many good leaders. So, everyone can benefit by learning how to become a leader and the change will be better for everyone involved. Each essay is short, so taken together, they are very digestible. The writing is good all around, but it's really the insights and examples from proven leaders that makes this so easy to use as a blueprint or study of leadership. Top notch ideas, well presented. Any one who serves or hopes to serve as a leader would do well by reading this book.

I love David Mamet's plays (recently, I laughed my way through the movie adaptation of State and Main), but this novel was disappointing. The event itself (described on the book jacket) is much more interesting than a fragmented interior monlogue by a less-than-fascinating protagonist. The idea invoked The Stranger, but unlike Camus who does a brilliant job, Mamet is much less brilliant. This read more like a literary experiment in a writing workshop than a polished piece by Mamet. If you want to read the master of this genre, stick to Camus.

This was a required book for a leadership course. To Morrison's credit, it is full of VERY specific advice and a step-by-step plan for companies to set and reach diversity goals. I was kind of surprised that she didn't spend much time on what exactly diversity is and why it is a noble goal besides the fact that we live in a diverse society, hence diversity. Before you know it, you're knee deep in a multitude of case studies and descriptions of how entrenched stereotypes of Hispanics, blacks and Asians can interfere with diversity efforts. I wouldn't exacty call it lively reading, but from a pragmatic standpoint, it does offer companies a good blueprint for how to put in a realistic diversity plan from many angles.In short, a useful book for managers or leaders in charge of spreading the gospel who need a model for making major changes. By reading about other companies' mistakes, I imagine others will be more fortunate in terms of avoiding these pitfalls.

Sure, this may be more of a panegyric more than a biography, but it's inspiring. As someone who has spent years in private schools, it's great to read about a headmaster who really shaped a school -- Boyden defines headmastership: he was head of Deerfield for 64 years! Even more impressive than Mr. Boyden was his wife whom he called the smartest person on the campus. Proves the theory that behind every great man is a great woman. I hope we restructure our school administrations so that we allow for heads like this again -- too much time is spent these days on fundraising and not enough on school. Though Boyden was not an intellectual, he inspired and trained generations of boys and never lost his personal touch.

I like this book for many reasons, one of which is that it didn't try to mindlessly replicate Into Thin Air as many adventure books have done. Instead, Norman remains very self-deprecating about his own climbing abilities while he focuses instead on his relationships with his daughter. He didn't smooth over the rough edges in family dynamics which I also found appealing. In short, by avoiding adventure cliches, he gives us an exciting account of the thrill of rock climbing, some great climbing stories and some very heartwarming insights into the relationship between fathers and daughters. This book was extremely well written and is a quick read. Congratulations to Norman who avoided all the pitfalls of the genre. His book is unique in the field and gratifying on many levels.

First of all, I love the bass. Second of all, I love Latin music and Latin jazz. Well, that means that his album is one of my all time favorites -- it swings! Not only is every track great, the recording is very high quality and will highlight any audiophile system. I have scores of great Latin music, but this is one of the CDs I keep coming back to time after time. Israel Lopez is one of the world's greatest living bass players (his nickname is Cachao) -- I've been meaning to buy volume 2 as well which should be just as good. This one is a winner.

I read this book when it first came out and I'm still laughing. How can you forget Barry's account of his family's trip to Japan? I love his description of trying to buy stuff from the vending machines. Dave Barry is the funniest writer in America -- if you haven't had the pleasure of reading him, drop what you're doing and buy all of his books. You will find yourself laughing out loud, where ever you are.

I confess outright to being a Carroll devotee - I've even collected all his books and stories and have corresponded with him "live" by email. Many Carroll fans have complained that his early books are impossible to find - I couldn't bare to spend over $200 for his first book, The Land of Laughs, so I was relieved when TOR decided to reissue it in paper back. Oddly enough, that means that I had read all of his books already except this one, his first. The good news is, it's fantastic. In fact, it's so good I don't know how he ever tried again. Many of the familiar Carroll traits are here: a few pit bulls, a small town, a blurred division between reality and fantasy, a wild cast of characters and a great plot. Some readers complain that his endings aren't as good as his beginnings, but this book is a masterpiece in that regard. I loved the plot in this book as well: a "drop out" English teacher with a famous father decides to leave his stodgy prep school and write a biography of Marshall France, his favorite children's author. Naturally Marshall created a fantasy world of characters which gives our narrator a chance to immerse himself in a town with a very strange history. Overall, I think it's the most perfectly conceived of all Carroll's books - the ending is perfect too. If you've never read anything by Carroll, buy the paperback of this one and read it - then follow your addiction by reading all his other great books too. His books are so mind-blowing that I can almost guarantee that you'll raise your IQ a few points just by trying to follow the events!

Most people who have even heard of Stendal know of him as the author of the Red and the Black. Thanks to the praise Harold Bloom bestows on this lesser known work in How to Read and Why, I think many are rediscovering this book as well. Imagine my surprise when I found it not hidden deep in the literature section, but right on the &quot;new release&quot; section thanks to the New modern library edition.Stendal, really Marie Beyle, wrote prodigiously during his lifetime and used over 200 nom de plumes, Stendal being only one of the more well known ones. He dictated this book in 54 days, impressive when you realize its girth. Stendal has been critized by many for his lack of style and proper French grammar, but thanks to fellow writer Balzac who wrote an influential review of the book, it gained much fame. Balzac wrote, &quot;Beyle has written a book in which sublimity glows from chapter after chapter...If the mediocre knew that they had a chance of raising themselves to the level of the sublime by understanding them, La Chartreuse de Parme would have as many readers as Clarissa Harlowe had on its first appearance.&quot;This novel has a bit of everything, but mostly court intrigue and love plots as we follow the unlikely hero, Fabrizio through his adventures, the most exciting of which for him seems to be his imprisonment in the tower. His charm lies in his complete inability to realize the importance of anything until after it happens. In fact, he sleeps through most of the important events: he gets drunk and barely remembers his small role in the Battle of Waterloo and later during his &quot;rapture&quot; in the tower, he finally discovers in his boredom that he is happy. As far as actually enjoying this book, I suspect that many modern readers will find parts either boring or hard to follow since many of the Italian court traditions are far from our experience. Unlike other long novels like War and Peace or Madame Bovary, this one might not hold interest levels the same way since it has a much denser plot and much less convincing characters. Still, I think we should appreciate this novel for its incredible scope and faithful recounting of a period long gone. It's not hard to see why it's a great novel, it just may not be as enjoyable to read as other great novels no matter how much praise Balzac heaps upon it.

There certainly is divided opinion on this novel! I really enjoyed the recreation of life in Vermeer's household. The author does a credible job of keeping close to the period history with her detailed descriptions of 17th century Delft life. Though some readers have complained about the writing, the book is presented from the point of view of the young girl who is forced to be a maid for Vermeer due to her father's disability (he can't practice his trade because his eyes were burned by the kiln's explosion). The writing then is that of a young girl recounting the daily chores and petty politics of the Vermeer household, trips to market, and her infatuation with Vermeer. In some ways, it's a love story (quite repressed) complete with jealousy, intrigue and lecherous gropings (not on Vermeer's part!). Though no one knows for sure the mysteries behind Vermeer's limited output, the author gives us a compelling version of his exacting standards and family situation which did not lend themselves to factory produced paintings. I found the passages about painting well done and thought-provoking. Parts of this short novel are positively luminous. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and is even remotely interested in Dutch painting. Perhaps diehard historians won't enjoy it, but the rest should find something to please them here.

I agree with my fellow reviewers who feel that stretches of this book felt s-l-o-w or irrelevent (I tried to rate 3 1/2 stars, but I can't), but when Brooks is on, he's right on. I'd recommend the book for its description of Latte towns and his trip to the REI headquarters -- I was laughing so hard on this last one that I couldn't catch my breath. Seems that many bobos want to dress like they are going out on an artic expedition to go to the supermarket to give them that sense of adventure. Many of my friends and I fit the bobo descriptions, especially the idea of the masochistic vacations that represent a &quot;fantastically expensive way to renounce the flesh in order to purify the spirit.&quot; Back to the REI description, he makes fun of the sunglass-clad crowd with glacier glasses &quot;(because you can never tell when a 600 foot mountain of ice might suddenly roll into town, sending off a hazardess glare). Rather than obsess over some of the boring chapters, I'd suggest you read what you find interesting and skim through the other chapters. Brooks is a fun writer, so I found myself reading everything and then wishing I'd skipped a few sections. Despite my criticisms, he had so many sharp observations and witty writing that I highly recommend this book, especially to fellow bobos.

What surprised me about rereading Madame Bovary was not how much I enjoyed it, but how much many of my AP English students enjoyed it. Unlike other &quot;older&quot; novels, this one held much more allure for its feminine perspective and for its many &quot;modern&quot; themes. I think fellow reviewer Mitchell does an excellent job going over some different perspectives we can appreciate, but I'd like to amplify his last perspective: young people do find the book startlingly modern. What other &quot;classic&quot; protagonist is so bold in seeking personal pleasure over convention? As for the writing, I wish I could read it in French -- often I got the feeling that the writing would be even better in the original, but to Flaubert's credit (and the translator's), its literary qualities are still intact. We had many lively debates regarding Emma's morality and her selfishness -- many in the class felt sorry for Charles. Students who are good readers enjoy Madame Bovary more than other more moralistic tales like the Scarlet Letter often read in the same course. They find Flaubert much &quot;hipper&quot; than his American counterpart Hawthorne.For anyone who has been saving the reading of this book, wait no more -- even though Flaubert claims not to have been that interested in plot or character, the book is still a lively and compelling read on every front. One of my all time favorites.

I think those who didn't like the novel are just not used to Irish voices -- read some Yeats, Joyce, etc... and then come back and read this again. It's innovative, experimental and depressing as all hell. It's makes Catcher in the Rye look like comedy. It's an Irish Heart of Darkness. You may not enjoy the story, but it's hard not to find the writing brilliant. Despite the fact that I felt like I needed to purify myself after reading this, it's an excellent work of literature. McCabe is a terrific writer.

This may not be Auster's most perfect novel, but he does such a good job with his characters that the book does have that quality of staying with you long after you close the last page. Even if you're not a dog lover, you have to relate to the way animals sometimes seem to understand just what we are saying. I agree that some of the middle of the book got stale, but several of the younger kids are well drawn which brought the interest right back. Even though the book seems like a light comedy at first, Auster has that knack of approaching world problems like homelessness, drugs, craziness, all through the back door, in this case, the comments of Mr. Bones, Willy's dog. It's quite a short book and probably would have made a better short story than a short novel, but still, I enjoyed it and found Auster's writing excellent.

I loved A Brief History, so it was with great anticipation that I picked up Hawking's latest. I have the greatest respect for him as both a person and a scientist. The good news is that the illustrations are terrific and really help elucidate some thornier concepts. The bad news is that when Hawking tries to oversimplify, he simply leaves out additional explanations that would have helped. The first few chapters are fairly straighforward, but when it comes to branes, I needed more info to figure it out. He didn't spend enough time making a concept like that clear to the general reader. And as another reader pointed out, he often toots his own horn, but hey, that doesn't bother me when someone is as qualified as Hawking.In sum, this is a worthwhile book for the clear explanations and good illustrations. I wish some of his explanations were MORE detailed, not less.

For a little known writer from a little known publisher to write such a delightful and polished book seems little short of a miracle. I LOVED this book from the first page to the end. The narrator, the eponymous Tom Wedderburn, stands with other great narrators like Jake Barnes. The first part of the book was my favorite recounting the narrator's childhood in Wyoming. Parts were so lyrical they could have been written by Twain or Faulkner. The summer spent in Julie's shadow was for me the best part of the book. Then comes the coming of age as the narrator heads off to the marines and eventually to Iwa Jima. This was a great war account, reminscent of The Things they Carried. Except for a few small typos, the book is incredibly rich and powerful. I admit I was sad when I turned the last page. Let's hope this writer is "discovered" so he can gain more exposure for his excellent writing.

Ultimately, this is a more satisfying collection of Anthony's music than his greatest hits collection (Desde el principio) because the editor does not chop of the endings to his best songs. I was super disappointed that in that collection, someone decided to take the last 45 seconds or so of No te conozco (and they even lie about it on the alleged time length on the CD) which is perhaps the best part of the song. I was forced to buy this CD just to have the regular version complete with the &quot;que no soy suficiente para ti...tu y yo no sabemos...&quot; There are many of his top hits on this disc, so anyone who is already a fan will love this CD. Though occassionally I think some of his songs have cheesy arrangements that verge on too &quot;pop,&quot; many of his classics are here and are excellent. If you only buy one of his CD's, this is probably the one.

Following in the great literary tradition of journey tales (The Odyssey, The Divine Comey, Pilgrim's Progress, 100 Years of Solitude), Helprin writes another masterpiece (almost as good as A Winter's Tale) of modern fiction. The story is so real and the characters so 3 dimensional that your feet will hurt as you relive not just the physical journey, but the emotional journey through war torn Europe through the mind of the protagonist. A work of art brilliantly written and conceived.

I understand why so many people gave this book positive comments: someone even compared it to The History of the Senses, but I have to say that Ackerman's book is vastly better. Allende puts too much of her ego in here which swamps any eroticism that would be present. The illustrations are great, the recipes are nice, but the tone is so self congratulatory (she's a great writer, great lover, great cook, great researcher) that at times I'd read a sentence and actually grimace. I can't fault her research which definitely provides information that is inherently interesting and provocative. However, the writing is poor in parts, the editing is lax (she just wanders all over the place) and the book is utterly devoid of charm or literary merit despite a nice presentation. That's what made this book so disappointing and gave the appearence of a sellout -- just to talk about sex and food IS interesting, but to talk about how Allende views past lovers and current lovers is much less interesting. I like Allende overall, but this book is a literary fiasco in a nice package.

I'm sure most people will come to Fitzgerald through her novels, so I have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories. I still haven't decided if I enjoyed the collection, but they are unique. I thought the first story was by far the best, but after that, the quality varied widely. Unlike a classic short story writer (someone like Guy de Mauppassant), these stories have NO resolution for the most part. In fact, they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key. Discordant is the word I'm looking for. The settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries. I suspect most would enjoy her novels more (I am certainly heading in that direction to read them next), but I can't say since I haven't read them myself. Overall, I found this collection a bit unsettling, but still well written. I'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than I did on this first encounter.

There's not much to like about this book. The narrative is purposely disjointed, supposedly to mirror the mixed up state of mind of our narrator. Unfortunately, it's hard to feel very sorry for her since she doesn't seem to have it so bad. She's haunted by visions of bad slasher films with blood, bats, gore, ketchup, and has to be put on medication to get by day to day. Getting her period only seems to make things worse. There's a slight love interest with Toby, but there's so little character development that it's hard to care what happens. Overall, this book was tiresome to read and depressing as well. I did not think the writing was very noteworthy either. The only good thing is that it's not very long. Other than that, I can't think of much to recommend it.

Mimi Doe writes with clarity and grace about what we as parents should be doing but don't always make time for. She organizes the book by months and seasons and gently guides us through the maze of parenting. The tips are not only useful but inspiring as well since they are all doable if we make time for them.Parents should keep this guide right by their bed and refer to it on a daily basis to keep their lives balanced and to be a strong force in their kids' lives as well. While reading this book, I wanted to go hug my daughter and say sweet things to my baby son. Must reading for parents with kids of all ages.

As an astute reader will notice, opinions vary greatly about this bookfrom those who feel it's the greatest 20th century novel to those...who feel it's an exploitative piece of junk.After having read the book and most of the reviews below, I'mundecided. I agree ... about the nature ofthe Babi Yar narrative, yet on the other hand I found it one of themost riveting Holocaust scenes I've ever read. There's no doubt thatit has a complex narrative structure and strong writing throughout --it's still hard to judge it for its overall merit. The experience ofreading the first part ... remindsme of the experience of reading the first section of Faulkner's TheSound and the Fury -- in the latter example, once you realize thatit's written from the perspective of a 33 year old retarded boy, youcan start to piece together what's happening. The opening poem hasmuch of that same power but we don't find out the meaning until muchlater. I liked the Freudian analysis and exchange. For those whohave read Freud's actual case studies, the analysis will seem quiteauthentic and on target. No matter what you ultimately think of thenovel, you have to appreciate its complexity and ambition. I tend tocome out on the side of great novel. Parts of it are very disurbing,but fitting to the subject matter. Certainly worth reading.

I've had somewhat of an odyssey finding this CD -- when I first heard the song La novela about 6 months ago (Asi que es me gusta a mi, cuando tu te mueves asi, me rompiste el corazon...), I kept trying to figure out the artist, but the DJ never said who it was. I tried calling the radio stations, but could never get a live person. I tried searching for the song lyrics and the title I thought it had, but as you can see, that song's title is actually La novela. But then I remembered part of the lyric that went &quot;El hombre mas famoso de la tierra -- fulanito de tal&quot; and when I was browing CDs on Amazon, I recognized the group and heard the song. I love merengue and dominican music, but this is an even better combination. These guys combine rap, hip hop, merenge and house music to make a unique, danceable and high energy combination. If I were doing step aerobics to this, I'd be 100 pounds thinner by now. If you haven't discovered this disc yet, buy it now -- almost every song is good and the beat is incredible. Use it as your exercise/workout disc. I can't believe I finally found this group. Great stuff!

I'm not even a history buff and I loved this book. Though much of the history will be common knowledge, for me I had to fill in a lot of gaps. Almost as interesting as Adam's life was surrounding period details of the time -- travelling overseas in sickening journeys to Europe, the diet, the daily activities of New England farmers, life in France and England, etc... McCollough gives us a history of the age and times as well. The chapters on France are fascinating as well as Adams' travels to Amersterdam and England. I was surprised to find that Abigail emerged as even more of a heroic figure than Adams at times. Their close relationship, even through their many illesses was one of the most illuminating and inspirational parts of the book. A great read.

Having read a fair number of arguments about why this book is a hoax, I concur with the critics and don't find it convincing. Sure, it's interesting to think of the idea that a master being, G-d if you will, encoded the Bible with everything that will every happen or everything that could happen. As a Jewish person who has studied Torah and Old Testament in college and in religious school, I concede that there are lots of interesting phenomenon in Hebrew: Gematria for instance, which uses the Hebrew number equivalents to prove points. As much as I like the idea, this book is bogus. It was so bad that it made me think that it was an elaborate hoax to sell books. The author spends a lot of time telling us that he worked for the NY Times and the Wall Street Journal, as well as how much time he spent flying back and forth to Israel to warn various political figures that they might be knocked off by a killer any time now. The science is shaky, and the author shifts the sands constantly to prove his point. Once an event happens, he finds it in the code, but for future events, all he can say is that any outcome is only a possibility until it happens. Give me a break! Now I'm motivated to check up on the sites and articles that show exactly what is wrong with his argument. I'm not a mathematician or a biblical scholar, but believe me you won't need to be either to see through this pathetic excuse for unbiased scholarship. Give me a few hundred thousand dollars and a computer and I'll show you that the cartoon Garfield contains everything we need to know about quantum physics!

Fans of Elie Wiesel will love this book even more than Night or Dawn. I don't mean any disrespect to Wiesel, but Levi is much more of a great writer and all his books are much more moving and well-written than Wiesel's. Unfortunately, Levi committed suicide soon after writing his great books, but after you read his accounts, you'll understand why. He has produced the best Holocaust narratives in existence -- you'd be naive not to read them and compare them to any others you've read.

Their first two releases are still two of my favorite CD's -- I listen to them often. At first some of the electric guitar and modern touches threw me off on this CD, but not for long. If you take a few moments to accustom yourself, you may find that this CD is even better than the first two. I love it already and I've only had it for a few days. As usual, the cover art and jewel case art are enticing -- this music has all the flavor of flamenco, Andulusia and Morocco all mixed up into one. Some of the &quot;new&quot; instruments they used on this album sound amazing. My only complaint is that at 36 minutes, this CD is WAY to short -- come on guys, give your fans a few more minutes to hold onto!

It's hard not to assign 5 stars to this early work of the author of the Divine Comedy. In any serious Dante course, a professor will usually pick the Vita Nuovo as an introduction to Dante's work. The work is not at all intimidating -- rather, it's quite accessible to the modern reader. Dante, in his youth, writes a series of love tributes to Beatrice, his ultimate guide in the Divine Comedy. Anyone who is contemplating reading the Divine Comedy should start here and read this first as mandatory background to the Commedia. Dante rules!

Here's hoping that you didn't already read the above review by Kirkus because it manages to give away the entire book in a few short sentences. Though it wasn't a work of art, it was a good and quick read. The author hits his groove when he talks about the joy of setting sail out on the open sea -- even for a non-mariner, the details of managing a sailboat are quite clear and easy to follow. There is the mandatory storm scene (quite well done though) and then the revelation from one of the brothers that he really isn't plotting to Walker Island at all. I'd rather not ruin the drama, but there are some good brother to brother bonding scenes and some of the scenes were well described. I'm not sure why if the author's life so closely parallels that of his characters that he didn't just make this a non-fiction account. The confusing forward seems to tell us that the account IS real, but then at the end it seems that it's a novel after all. A solid and enjoyable read overall.

Wow. What a voice! I stumbled upon this disc by accident, but what a lucky find it was. Almost every song is memorable. I agree with the description below that her voice is reminscent of Billy Holiday. I had never heard any music from Cape Verde before, but this disc sent me in search of her earlier music. If you like Cuban music, salsa and Latin dance music, give this CD a try.

As a fan of Murakami, I picked up this book right away when I saw another Japanese writer who won Japan's top literary award, the Akutagawa Prize. This is a small, meditative volume on the crippling effects of war on peacetime existence. Although the horrible events of the war happened many years ago, they changed Manase's life forever. He is unable to connect with his wife -- he becomes addicted to classifying stones and trying to collect as many stones as he can. Soon, he is an expert and can identify almost any stone in China. The only person who breaks through the barrier is his oldest son who turns out to be a geology prodigy of sorts. Unfortunately, after his brutal death, things fall apart quickly. Although it will only take you an hour or so to read this book, it will touch you long afterwards.

Overall, this book is a straightforward examination of performance analysis that explains why p.a. is more practial than traditional &quot;training.&quot; It's a godsend for people who have to implement a plan right away because of the abundance of checklists and templates. I have some minor criticisms though since I have read several books in a similar category. 1 -- the author does not write as professionally as others (Rothwell, for example, who wrote Beyond training and Development) and spends too much time touting her earlier books 2 -- often the information borders on the extremely obvious 3 -- the book is overpriced as many textbooks are. P.A. boils down to the fact that it's really a &quot;casing the joint&quot; type of strategy -- get a general idea of the situation before diving in. All this fancy terminology for such a basic idea... still, it can definitely save a company a lot of time and money to do this common sense approach before spending money on training.

Even though I feel like I have every key Cuban recording, I'm always on the lookout for great CD's, and this is one of them. Like Cuban Counterpoint (History of Son Montuno), this collection serves up many classic son, merengues, son montunos, with all great renditions. Compay Segundo sings nearly all of them along with some special guests -- almost every song is a classic. This disc has my favorite recording of Cuarto de Tula, a terrific son &quot;el jardinero&quot; and many more that will make you want to own this CD if you like classic Cuban son. Unlike Chanchaneando (another one in this &quot;Roots of Buena Vista&quot; Collection), this CD provides over 20 tracks with over an hour of music. You'll get your money's worth on this one.

If the only thing your remember about Erasmus from high school is that he's a Humanist and has a serious looking face, you should pick up this short tome and read it. Lest you think writers &quot;back then&quot; weren't funny, guess again. This book lambasts everyone from Popes and Cardinals to merchants and ownders for their ridiculous pursuits. My only regret is that the edition I read (not the Penguin) had no footnotes at all and no explanation of background information. Even though the work is short, I'd recommend going with the Norton Critical Edition, or at least one that has some explanatory notes. It will greatly enrich your understanding. Of course, his book was super-popular because of its naughty content and criticisms. In the guise of his little &quot;folly&quot; play, everyone gets it at the hand of a master.

This is my kind of travelogue -- Kaplan starts in eastern bloc countries like Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria (the only 3 he talks about that I've travelled to myself) and then continues on to Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, etc... Although I haven't seen these other places, Kaplan makes me feel like I'm there with him on long bus and train rides observing the people, faces and customs. I enjoyed his historical precis of the situations in every country he travels in. Of course his account is biased because he bases his observations on &quot;expert&quot; opinions from different countries, many of whom have their own agendas. My only criticism is that sometimes Kaplan has the tendency to overgeneralize or oversimplify. But for the most part, unless you are an expert in these regions you will still take away a tremendous amount of information. I found the book absorbing and well-written from start to finish.

I think that some have been a little harsh as to the merits of this book -- there are those scientists that dashed off hurried responses to the question, but there are just as many others who took the time to write thoughtful essays. Just having the chance to see how scientists and other creative people put their thoughts together makes the book worthwhile reading -- think of it as brain food for your mind. The responses ranged from the more obvious answers like the birth control pill, to more out there ones like the eraser and free will. If nothing else, these essays are written in digestible pieces and provide a good overview of major discoveries since man has inhabited the earth. Most will find it provoking. I'm fairly certain the thermos quote was tongue in cheek.

I agree with others -- this is one of the finest world music CD's out there. There's something magical about the combination of flamenco, Northern African and Spanish music played on authentic instruments. It's stirring, inspirational, intensely beautiful... If you like world music, this will soon be your favorite CD. As the old Far Side used to say, &quot;Truly, it doesn't get any better than this.&quot;

I'm a long time collector of Cuban music and this is a terrific introduction. Unlike many of the recordings I have from the 30's and 40's, this is a crystal clear recording with many Cuban classics like Dos gardinias and Cuarto de Tula that are very hard to find. Every once in a while, Ry Cooder's guitar gets annoying, but that's a small complaint on an album that is about as authentic as you can get. If you speak Spanish (or if you don't, read the excellent liner notes/translation), you'll appreciate the songs even more, but it's not necessary. Die hard fans of this style will want to seek out the best &quot;son&quot; disc out there: El son es el mas sublime -- it's not as well recorded since these are the originals, but it has many famous son and son montunos. I'm glad this music has such a wide appeal.

What a fantastic book! "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see? I see a red bird looking at me; red bird, red bird, what do you see...." It's the first book that my 3 year old has memorized cover to cover so it looks as though she's actually reading. Thanks to the colorful illustrations, big bold pages and whimsical creations, any child would be drawn to this book. The phrasing lends itself to memorization, the first step on the way to actually reading. A must buy for young children, right up there with the author's other similar book, Polar Bear, Polar Bear.

I confess that I haven't really listened to any "new" rock besides maybe Coldplay since the 70's and 80's, but I've become a huge White Stripes Fan. I loved all their other albums so far. Jack White reminds me of Robert Plant and I think he's a great songwriter with a distinctive voice. I love the fact that this album is different. If you buy all their albums and listen, you could really say each album is different -- the first one is very bluesy and very Led Zepplin like, Elephant has great guitars and driving beats... this new one is fanastic in its own way. In fact, I find it more addicting than the others becuase of the neat use of marimba, great guitar playing and some unusual songs. My personal favorite is Red Rain but that must be my inner Led Zepplin speaking. I think for many new Stripes fans this is the most accessible album. Two of my friends heard it upon my insistance and after just one listen really enjoyed it. Even if you're not a die hard White Stripes Fan, this is a great album to buy to get to know them. I just saw them in concert and they were awesome. My only complaint was the guitar was amped so much you could barely hear Jack's voice, and that's a shame!

I love Gaardner as a writer. He writes books about the magic of growing up and discovering things. This is one of his toughest books because the young girl and main character finds these secret packages containing chunks of the history of philosophy. Although I'm far from a philosophy expert, I find Gaardner's explications a heck of a lot easier to understand than many of the philosophers themselves or the critics who try to explain them. Short of a philosophy course, this is the best introduction to the major figures of philosophy you're likely to find, andit's twisted throughout a novel about growing up. What an imagination!

I'm a big fan of the idiot's guides since they are always clear and easy to follow. The authors do an excellent job of explaining complex terms and concepts so even an ordinary person can understand the reasons behind drafting a will. After reading this book, you'll see that you'll want to do everything you can so that you do not find yourself &quot;intestate&quot; -- then the state fights over what belongs to whom. Although it's difficult to think about dying, it's even worse to think about having all your money thrown to taxes or tied up in court as relatives fight. Prevent this ugly mess by learning the basics of wills and estates. I should add that this book goes well beyond the basics -- even a millionaire could learn a few good tips from this excellent book.

Collins is really the forerunner of the whole genre of detective fiction and this is his finest book. I also loved the Moonstone, but this is clearly his most perfect work. I challenge anyone to start reading and then to try to put this book down before you are through (and since it's quite long, it's not easy). Once you've read all of Agatha Cristie's books, you can see how she must have read Collins to structure her books and plots. Unlike many new detective novels, you also get the benefit of great Victorian writing. Think of it as killing two birds with one stone: reading a Jane Austen book with a gripping mystery plot! Do NOT opt for the abridged version -- it would be a shame to miss even one word of Collins' original text.

The &quot;third eye&quot; of the title refers to the red dot that a propective sub-letter wears between her eyebrows. Our slightly warped but endearing narrator Jefferson chooses &quot;victims&quot; to sublet his apartment so he can spy on them and use them as subjects for his reality based art. Although the story sounds twisted, Knowles is so terribly clever that he resists the tawdry.This is a tremendous novel -- Knowles gets almost everything right. First of all, the New York stuff is right on -- the eateries, the snobbery, the housing market, the 42nd street library, etc.... As a native New Yorker myself, I loved the New Yorkiness of this book right down to the narrator's odd food cravings and penchant for gourmet wine.I also loved the understated hyper education level of the narrator. The resulting dialogue is at times hilarious. Take for example this excerpt in which he is explaining to a prospective tenant about his background in classical music, &quot;When I was a young boy, six or seven, I'd stand in front of the mirror holding a pair of chopticks like two conductor's batons. I'd wave the things around in the air listening to whole symphonies. I memorized Beethoven's Fifth from start to finish. Got pretty good at making up my own signals.&quot; With no comment at all, the girl replies, &quot;When I was six I listened to ABBA and Air Supply.&quot; End of joke and dialogue continues. Knowles doesn't have to play extra hard for the laugh because he writes such good dialogue.At times you'll feel like you're in the mind of a serial killer, but actually the narrator is far more benign than that -- just a little voyeuristic in his search for art. Though evil lurks in the background, it never becomes ugly and the joke turns on our narrator.I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a suspensful, New Yorky read.

Of all their albums, this is a close second (some would say first) to the Joshua Tree. Remember MTV? When I think back to my childhood, I can still vividly remember the Gloria video. U2 has always been a tremendous group. Even today, this is still a beautiful album to listen to with one great song after another. It's a bit more mellow than The Joshua Tree, but that's not meant as an insult. Fans of U2 who want all their best music would be remiss not to buy this album.

Okay, I admit that I've read every single Dirk Pitt novel, but remember, they've been around for years. There are two possibilities: 1)I was too young to notice that his writing his horrible or 2)his writing has gotten worse. I'm not trying to take a cheap shot because the plot follows the same hallowed formula as always and does it well: ancient mystery, major international intrigue replete with lots of really bad guys, and our heroes meet beautiful women and solve the mystery with some sea salvage operations in the middle. When Cussler sticks to descriptions of technical stuff, he's quite good, but his dialogue is so bad that it can make you wince. Plus, he telegraphs everything with an incredible overuse of adverbs and adjectives ("he said grimly, she said seductively") -- come on Clive, as a writer you must have studied the famous Hemingway dictum to "show, not tell." In short, I loved the plot, I still get a kick out of Dirk even in his older age, I love the reappearance of the old cast of characters like Perlmutter and Hiram Yaeger and Al, but Mr. Cussler needs to clean up his prose and avoid the pat endings (the thing with Dirk's kids was almost sickening). I hate to complain because I've read the whole series, but this time the writing quality really bothered me to the point of interfering with my enjoyement of the book. And the author's ego (forgot the cameos, they were okay the first five times, but it's getting old) seems more noticeable in this book. I'd recommend this one for old fans only. Makes me want to reread Raise the Titantic to see if the old ones really were better.

This is my favorite Murakami novel. As another reviewer pointed out, it's quite hard to describe as Murakami defines convention. But, its prose (and the translation) is magical, the story captivating and the events contained therein indescribeably beautiful and mysterious. This novel haunted me for months after I read it. Writing this review is making me want to pick it up again. It will blow you away.

I judge this collection on its own merits as I have not read other collections of Feynman's writings. For non scientists, this book is enlightening. Lest you think that one of the most famous physicists of the century was a dull, scholarly guy, you'd be well off the mark. These essays give terrific insight into an extraordinary mind -- some of the essays trace how his father (not a scientist by trade, but certainly possessing a spirit of scientific inquiry) talked to him as a small boy and encouraged him to find out more about the world around him. Others give us the silly side of Feynman: while he and his colleagues were slaving away at Los Alamos to solve the problem of developing a nuclear bomb, he found time to devote a whole separate hobby of breaking into safes and locked cabinets. Even in these seemingly inconsequential anecdotes, the reader sees how a brilliant scientist pursues his various quests. He sounds positively elfish and was never afraid to speak his mind as we see in his most non personal essay in this collection about the cause of the Challenger Disaster -- he basically points out how unscientific the engineering was and why it was not all that surprising that it crashed because of the methodology used in the process.The only slight personal disappointment comes in his personal side, or lack thereof. He mentions his wife only a few times, and she dies almost in a footnote -- it made Feynman seem somewhat heartless, but let's assume that part of the problem had to do with the essay selection. These essays are fascinating both for their explanation of scientific genius and for their historical scope that sweeps through many of the most important discoveries of the century. Highly recommended.

This is the first book I've read by Coetzee, but I can definitely see why he's considered a great writer. At first, his writing seems almost plain, but then you start to read into the silences and the gaps and understand that his art is to say so much more (or even to imply so much more) than the words themselves can. He reminds me of Hemingway a little, in that many think that he's a simple writer although in fact he's very cerebral and complex. Lurie is not an enjoyable character, but you will feel his pain. For me, this book was a real discovery and sent me on the path to read Michael K.

Okay, so the comparison to Mann's work is a bit far fetched, but this book is a Jungian exploration of our main character's consciousness. Thanks to the convention of having Davey recount his story to his shrink, we feel a bit detached and disoriented. There is an element of almost-mysticism and we trace all the paths of Davey's mind and experiences. How did this famous criminal lawyer become such an incorrigible drunk and why does he check himself into Zurich for analysis? Unfortunately I read Fifth Business 4 years ago, so I can't remember any of the story line or comment on the relation of this book to the first. It seems to me though that this book does not depend on the first book in the series. I plan to read World of Wonders next, so I'll have more to say about the relation.Back to this book -- it's extremely engrossing with penetrating descriptions of all the characters in Davey's life and a curiously detached view of his life. I couldn't put it down, even at the end when the mystical element almost gets out of hand and he literally climbs the mountain and crawls through a primal cave. Even if you don't buy all the Jungian stuff, Davies is such a good and interesting writer that most should enjoy the experience. As a social commentator, he reminds me of Thomas Wolfe. A gripping read.

I've just finished a Davies marathon: the whole Deptford trilogy in 3 days. I think it a testament to Davies' great storytelling ability that I could not put down any of the three books. I suggest reading them in close succession because the second book (The Manticore) sheds a lot of light on the other two books. It's interesting that in this book (the 2nd), we get 250 pages or so written from the point of view of a minor character: Boy Staunton's son. If you stop to think about it, the whole trilogy is structured around the question &quot;Who killed Boy Staunton,&quot; so it shouldn't be surprising to read an account by his drunken son, the famous lawyer of his counseling sessions in Zurich. Rarely does one find such well-drawn characters these days in novels -- by the end, you'll feel like you've known Paul Demster for years, along with the simian Liesl, level-headed Ramsey and of course Demster's character, Eisengrim.This book is a bit &quot;deeper&quot; than the first two as we find ourselves transported to an almost magic-realism portrait of myth and fantastical events in the World of Wonders. I actually enjoyed the first two books more although I still think this last book is a master work. Occassionaly Eisengrim's recounting of his life gets a bit tedious, but only because we are dying to resolve the mystery which finally gets solved in the closing pages. All in all, a memorable trilogy and a gripping read by one of the great 20th century writers.

I can't help but think of the Mel Brooke's parody of the Spanish Inquisition (&quot;Hey Torquemada, what do you say? I said I just got back from the auto de fe...) while reading of Galileo's troubles with defending the Copernican system in 17th century Italy. This book provides a vivid portrait of Galileo's personal life coupled with his brilliant scientific theories and experiments. If you like historical ficiton, you'll love this book for its portrait and background of Florence, Venice, The Medici's, Pope Urban, and the rest of cast of characters in Galileo's life. Though the book title makes you think it's about his daughter, that's not the case -- it's about Galileo as seen through the letters preserved from his daughter. Except for her devotion and sweetness, we learn much more about him than her in this book which is just as well since his life was more interesting. Among other high level science and astromony lessons you'll learn, you'll be thankful that we don't have to deal with the Bubonic plague or many other common ailments -- Galileo (like Beethoven) suffered his whole life with many serious ailments. Who knows what else he might have discovered if he hadn't been bedridden for much of the time. A quick moving and engaging historical account of Galileo and his accomplishments.

I admit that I found this book incredibly dull next to the three Motley Fool books I had read previously. I guess I just like some humor and irreverence -- this book is a bit too &quot;straight,&quot; although I suppose most investment specialists can't be comedians. The information is useful and well laid out, although I found the Motley Fool books more useful with more layman explanations of concepts like the P/E ratio. Sivy doesn't describe enough what these terms signify -- he pretty much tells you what things are.Anyway, he does provide some good solid information, it's just that other books out there do what he does and do it better. This book reads (surprise, surprise) like a long article in Money Magazine who Sivy writes for.

This is the most eclectic book on religion I've come across in some time. As someone who's studied quite a bit of Jewish history, I'm used to books that focus on one religion. That's what I liked so much about this book -- Armstrong traces the three monotheistic religions from the beginning all the way to the 20th century. The first three chapters cover Judaism, Christianity and Islam while the following chapers look at all three through differernt epochs like the philosphes, the medievalists, the Reformation, etc... I felt that she was very objective and not partial to one religion or another -- after all, that's not the point. I know some have criticized her coverage of one specific area, but I found no grounds for these criticisms -- she's very fair and scholarly. Cleary Armstrong knows her stuff. The book is lively, scholarly and very well-written. In my opinion, it's always useful to look at your own religion from an outside vantage point -- this book lets you do just that.

I'm a big fan of Car Talk and love Ray and Tom's sense of humor. I wanted to love this book. The opening chapters of their biographies and opinions on things like driver's licenses were well done, interesting and funny in parts. In the true rant section, things got a bit unfocused, unfunny and &quot;out there.&quot; If you want a coherent &quot;rant&quot; book, try The O'Reilly factor which is much better done and much funnier and pointed.I'm not trying to be uncharitable -- there are funny parts, but next to geniuses like David Barry or Dennis Miller, this book pales. The most interesting part was about their lives, not their rants. A mediocre book from the still funny guys on Car Talk. I'm still a fan of their show, but not a huge fan of the book. At least it took less than an hour to read!

In this offbeat novel, T.C. Boyle brings his usual blend of sharp humor and social commentary. The chapters alternate between the present and the year 2026 when humans have killed off all the animal species, destroyed the ozone layer and vacated the earth of trees. We follow the career of Tyrone O'Shaughnessy who starts out as a committed environmentalist and ends up doing time as an eco-terrorist. Although he is the protagonist, he is overshadowed by the shadow of his daughter Sierra's story - the tree-sitter. There are some hilarious bits (although they don't appear even a bit hilarious to novel's characters) like when Ty escapes from the hospital naked from the waist down or when the last lion devours the chief animal patron. As you can see, Boyle's humor is a bit dark, but it's humor nonetheless. Although I enjoyed the novel, I am much fonder of Boyle's short stories. For some reason, his novels never seem to pack the same punch that his short stories do. Maybe it's because we don't sympathize with any of the characters. It's a bit bleak in fact. Thus, I recommend this to diehard fans, but for new Boyle converts, start with a short story collection like Without a Hero.

This is what you call a high adrenaline book! It will make you feel guilty for sitting in a comfy chair reading about the ardous physical and mental training. I loved this book -- I've always had a great respect for military training, but I was particulary interested in reading about the mental games. Most people focus on the physical, but Ricks shows how the mental games are just as important for surviving. This is a no-nonsense, journalist, first hand account of marine boot camp. The detail and insider perspective make it a great read!

I read this beautiful short story collection after just finishing all of Helprin's lengthy novels. I was surprised that a writer who produced such brilliant long works of fiction (A Winter's Tale and Soldier of the Great War) could write just as well in a short story format. These stories are incredible. The one about the loons in Vermont is one of the most devastatingly haunting stories I have ever read. The opening story is one of my favorites as well. After finishing all of Helprin's works, I'm convinced that he's one of those rare writers that inspires you to want to walk around in his mind for a day to see how he pens such memorable works.

The first thing the reader will notice is that this book is much more accessible than more overtly scholarly texts -- this is a good thing for either first time readers or long time fans of Homer's works. The opening chapters set the scene well and explain her methodology of picking special moments that illuminate the work as a whole. I enjoyed the first half of the book tremendously and found many fresh insights and interesting observations about both the Iliad and the Odyssey. My only slight disappointment was with the last 50-100 pages which focus mostly on plot summary of the Odyssey rather than her interesting commentary although she points out things along the way the readers should note. The last section reads more like Cliff's Notes while the first two-thirds of the book genuinely added to the reader's delight in Homer's works. Overall an excellent book.

I'm a big fan of the Putumayo collections -- I even like their cover art. Like the other CD's I've enjoyed from them, this one is pretty awesome. It's gorgeous to look at with full page pictures and bios of each artists that allows you to learn something about the life and background of each singer. They also did a great job mixing the songs together so that there is no dead silence. If you're a dancing fan, this one if for you. It reminds me a bit of one of their other CD's from Cairo to Casablanca which is also excellent. If you like middle eastern music (high energy version) you'll enjoy this well done CD.

I don't want to sound like a curmedgeon, but this book is, to put it mildly, way too self-indulgent. I too like to bike and think, &quot;Wow, the world is a great place,&quot; but I truly didn't think anyone else would care. This is a self-indulgent recap of &quot;neat things Diane Ackerman has done in her life&quot; loosely tied together by this deep play idea she gets from Huizinga without ever citing the original source material. It's not that I didn't enjoy reading it -- I did. It reminds me of reading a diary or a travel-log of a friend's adventures. But, compared to her other works, this is fluff with too much of a focus on the author. If the author hadn't been well-known, this never would have been published.

As a fan going back to Grupo Mania, I have not been disappointed by this CD, although maybe 3-4 songs are too popish for me. Still, with Tu sonrisa, suavemente and luna llena, there is plenty of hard driving merengue here. I've been working out to this CD and I swear I go twice as fast during the top speed merengues -- I never get tired of his &quot;pequena, echate pa'ca&quot;. For some reason I find Elvis endearing. If he stays away from the cheesy stuff and sticks to merengue, he'll continue to stay at the top of modern merenguistas.

This is a terrific book. Unlike other Holocaust memoirs, this one does not focus on the camps, but rather on the author's father, mother and grandparents who were (largely) spared thanks to their musical ability. The author does a great job reporting the years leading up to the Nuremberg laws and the pograms. In fact, it's kind of rare to read such a gripping account of the 10-15 year period preceding the camps. We really feel the righteous indigation that the Jews felt since they were such strong German patriots, many of whom had fought for Germany. Many considered themselves Germans first and Jews second. The author writes a gripping tale of music, culture and Nazi horrors -- my only small complaint is his heavy handed foreshadowing which seems entirely unnecessary since most of us know how the story turns out. The musical diversions and descriptions of concert repoirtoiry were fascinating in their own rite. Not to mention the irony of all the great German composers, yet after a while the Jews were not allowed to "sully" their music.I was also impressed with his ability to view impartially the role of the Kunderbund -- some say it saved many a life while others say that it kept many Jews in Germany who would have emigrated earlier. The author presents both sides of the debate. The final chapters about the author's grandfather and uncle and the guilt his father bore show us once again how even far into the war many understimated the power of the Nazis. A rivetting read from start to finish.

This is one of the worst written books of all time. I still cant believe it was such a big seller, but who am I to speak for the American public. I guess there are a lot of desperate and unhappy people out there who wanted to be that woman when Mr. Perfect walked through the door. This book was so bad that I resented the hour or so it took me to fly through it -- I could have cleaned the bathroom or something. At least the movie had an excuse (it is much more enjoyable than the book with its cheesy Hollywood plot), but this kind of horrible writing is embarrassing. See the movie instead.

The author does an excellent job of culling not only the most interesting and exciting pieces of 19th century travel writing, but editing out the dull parts so that every line draws you in. To make the book even more readable, she writes helpful short introductions which set the scene and explain the context of each adventurer along with his/her adventures. Big names like Darwin and Shackleton are represented along with many lesser known writers who were equally captivating. I've read many exploration/adventure books in the past few years, but as far as a great collection, I've come across no more exciting reading than this one. From Polar to equatorial to nautical, every time of extreme adventure is represented and the incredible leadership of many of the explorers shines through. Even more noteworthy is the obervational detail the authors provide as naturalists and observers of the world around them, largely unexplored during much of that time period. A great read!

I enjoyed the opening chapters with the Mayan calendar theme and the period details, but then things fall apart as Esquivel either recycles older material or whips off the remainder of the book in 10 minutes time. It's a quick read so it's not like you'll spend more than an hour reading it and the plot was interesting and touching, but it just doesn't hold together. In short, it's not very magical or interesting past the opening chapters. Her father sounds like an amazing man -- there are some great scenes, but a bunch of great scenes don't make a great novel unless they are more seamlessly intergrated. I couldn't get over the feeling that this was an old composition dressed up quickly for publication. Fans should read it anyway for the plot, but don't expect anything on a par with Like Water for Chocolate. This translation felt stilted in places.

I'm surprised how quickly those below critized this book. For the record, I HATED Bridges and found it almost unreadable. This book may not rank up there with Flaubert, but it was a heck of a lot better and more earnest than Bridges of Madison County. I have not read Gazebo, but Grayson does a nice job sketching the twin sisters who have never been great friends, one living in the shadow of the other. Nick, Harper's son, in very believeable and well drawn. The relationship between the sister's is believeable as well and nicely outlined.Though it may be predictable, this book has an unpretentious charm about it that made it thoroughly enjoyable to read. In fact, it's a sweet love story that avoids torrid sex scenes and errs in favor of a relationship. David, the teacher/astronomer is a compelling hero --- I love the description of his observatory! It's a quick read, but one that cheered me up and carried me along.

After having just seen Nathan Gunn perform a different work in person, I'm convinced that he's one of the greatest baritones on the planet. I found this piece absolutely captivating -- I can't stop playing it, especially the lovely 2nd and 3rd movements. Gunn's solos are exceptional and make the disc worth owning. I don't see how others have criticized the enunciation when in fact the English is very clear and easy to follow. In short order, this has become one of my favorite classical CD's of the year. If you haven't discovered Mr. Gunn yet, you owe it to yourself to check out this recording.

I've read everything Murakami ever wrote and this book, while quite good, is no where near the transcendent earlier works. I find it odd that after his densest book ever (The Wind up Bird Chronicle) comes his most accessible book. By all means read it, but not to the exclusion of his other books which are even better.

Ovid's tales are fantastic, but few readers make it through all of his tales. Hughes picks only the most famous and makes memorable translations of them. I use this book in our high school English curriculum for mythology -- it's just enough that students learn the essential Greek myths, but not too much that it becomes overwhelming. Hughes' translations are emminently readable. Sure, he could have included more, but those he does include are fanstastic and very vivid.

It's embarrassing to admit how much fun this book is. On top of the erotic content, Baker is just hilariously funny and on target. Sure, it's a book about phone sex, but there is no way to summarize Baker's literary tour de force. He's a terrific writer (he writes serious critical essays too) and this is one of his most audacious books. A very quick read.

This is an excellent collection worthy of all the praise it has received. Some of the songs are so catchy that you'll be singing them for days. Like the other Buena Vista disks, this has terrific liner notes with translations so that even those who don't speak Spanish can appreciate the lyrics which is half the fun. Those who get hooked on Cuban music from this fantastic recording should take the time to find some of the earlier classics by Celia Cruz or collections like &quot;El son es el mas sublime&quot; which are excellent although they don't have the same sound quality.

This is one of the best discs out there, both for its virtuosity and for its song selection. The songs are authentically Cuban and Gonzalez finally has been rescued from an obscure old age in Cuba -- the guy couldn't even afford his own piano. This disc is a must have in any serious Cuban collection. Great recording too.

I have not tired of this CD even though I've heard it almost a hundred times. I used to live in the south of Spain and this music brought back the flavor and intensity of the region. It's Arabic, Spanish, North African, all rolled up into one -- everyone who's ever heard this on my system has immediately wanted to get ahold of it for themselves. It's still one of my favorite &quot;international&quot; choices and has no weak songs at all. It's hypnotic and will carry you away.

Yes, this is a book to get completely lost and absorbed in. I found myself racing to finish although it's hard to race through the 450 or so pages (not that you should) but all of a sudden you realize that the beauty is in the details as much as if not more than in the overall plot. There are literally dozens of incredible scenes of small town Maine, high school adolescent follies, family turmoil, small town pettiness that comprise a slate of overall literary beauty. There is also devasting sadness; for example, in the relationship between Miles (one of the central characters) and his ex wife Janine who leaves him for the sexually heroic but otherwise vapid "Silver Fox," in the character of poor Cindy the cripple who has always been in love with Miles since her childhood, the chronically abused John Voss and too many others to name. There are also moments of sublime happiness as when Miles' mother Grace finds her week of happiness with her true love in the Vineyard before reality interferes. I agree that the book deserved a pulitzer for its detail and complexity of characters. By the end, you'll feel like you grew up in the town yourself. A modern masterwork.

I would never have known that Guy de Maupassant wrote novels along with his great short stories if another amazon reader hadn't turned me on to their existence. This novel, reminiscent of Madame Bovary (a male version, you might say) is terrific. You'll get a great deal of description of Paris in the late 19th century with period details worthy of any great novelist. The plot is typical: poor, rural young man from the outskirts (Rouen) has no money and no position in life, but longs to find fame and fortune. Thanks to his manly wiles (he's a natural ladies' man), he manages to sleep his way to the top. Like Madame Bovary, happiness is never really there no matter how much money and power he attains - the more you get, the more you realize that others will always have more. Still, Monsieur Duroy, even at his most calculating retains somewhat of a sympathetic quality that allows us to relate to him and root for his success. Despite its length, this novel is a fast read. One of my favorites of the year.

Hodson succeeds because he avoids the self congratulatory tone of many of this kind of travel narrative. He suffers with acute diarrhea, fever and eventually contracts hepatitis as a result of his arduous trip through the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, mostly the latter. This account avoids taking sides and does an excellent job showing what everyday life in the 80's in Afghanistan was like. Interesting how the "common" people often resented the Mujahedin for bringing attacks to their home turf. Sometimes the rebels are treated as heroes, sometimes as villains, but in any case we view all the contradictions, narrow point of view (one group thought Hitler was a great man simply because at one point he fought the "evil" Russians who were at war with their country) and fanatical devotion to the Islamic ideal. Though not as literary as other travelogues, Hodson achieves a gritty, down and dirty tone that serves his narrative well. An excellent read and an impressive journey into a dangerous and complicated land.

This book completes my quest (almost) to finish all of Carroll's books. It has taken me months to find out of print copies. The only one left for me is The Land of Laughs which is his first novel and so rare that copies sell for $200 and up! The author himself emailed me though and said that it will be reissued next year, so I guess I'll have to wait. Anyway, this is a much scarier book than most of his other books. The beginning is superb as we travel back to the narrator's childhood and his relationship with his sadistic brother Ross. Carroll as usual does an excellent job fleshing out the characters -- this is the first time I can think of when he focuses so much on kids and he does a great job. The narrator tells us how Ross was killed by the third rail of a train -- but then later admits that he pushed him because his brother was about to reveal an embarrassing secret. So, he feels guilty about his brother's death. Then, like a true horror novel, Ross comes back to haunt him in later relationships the author has with women in Vienna where he moves. This theme of death coming back to bother the living is continued in a more recent novel, From the Teeth of Angels which is also excellent. If you can acquire a copy of this book, definitely read it. I liked Bones of the Moon better because I'm scared too easily, but this does give the reader insight into Carroll's darker side.

I'm starting to feel like an Everest junkie after reading Into Thin Air and watching the IMAX account of that climb. I was skeptical that this book would add anything, so I guess it pleasantly surprised me. Because Dickinsin is not an &quot;expert&quot; climber, I enjoyed his open and honest perspective into climbing. As the scrappy guy, he surprises everyone by actually gaining strength and being able to attain the summit.This book has even more blow by blow detail than Into Thin Air. If you are interested in just how hard it is to make every step towards the top, this book will take you there. It's the closest many of us will get to any task of this magnitude. Plus, this book offers a new and interesting perspective: the NORTH face of the mountain, a tougher climb in many respects. As such, it serves as an excellent companion to Into Thin Air for its complimentary perspective. I enjoyed the vivid details of this book from the extraordinary sherpas to the feisty yak herders to the accounts of bowel evacuation on a high mountain. There are also some interesting personal insights. In short, an excellent read, well written and very detailed. I feel out of oxygen from the last 40 pages.

I loved Wills' book, not for its historical brilliance, but rather for its literary insights. At the time I read it, I was preparing to teach the AP Language and Composition course which focuses on Greek/Latin rhetoric -- this book goes well beyond the level required for AP English. I challenge any literary reader not to be wowed by Wills' analysis of Lincoln's speech. Although I didn't assign it in my AP class, it would be perfect because of the line by line dissection of this memorable speech.

Though the hip New Yorker style may not be for everyone, I loved just about every one of these stories. For all the criticisms leveled against Orlean, she has an uncanny ability to capture her subjects and get inside their lifestyle. The range of these stories is what makes them so interesting -- one of my favorites was the simple portrait of a typical 10 year old boy. In fact, I enjoyed the obscure people's portraits more than those of famous people like Bill Blass and Tonya Harding. Orleans is great at picking out the nuances of everyday life that make humans so fascinating. It's the type of book that's best split up into smaller sections. I read it straight through which can get a bit repetitive, but I still found myself reading late into the night to finish.

I'm not trying to be contrary -- in fact, I do echo much of the praise heaped upon this book. The tutorials are very well-organized and fun to do. Graphics are great and the book is high quality. I guarantee that you will be able to do many cool things with this program. My small gripe (which really isn't the author's fault) is that I really only wanted to learn how to fix photos from my digital camera. I don't really need to know all that other stuff. Sure, it's cool, but the emphasis of this book and the tutorials are on creating new things, not necessarily fixing up regular photos. Even the tutorial on photos pertain to fixing up old photos that are in bad shape. I am looking for more of an "idiot" oriented book on fixing my photos. So yes, I enjoyed it, but buy it only if you're interested in all the other aspects of photoshop, just just digital editing. Now I'll feel guilty if I just fix up a photos without creating multiple layers - I'm still not convinced you absolutely need layers to do simple lighting adjustments or other basic edits.

I read every review, both positive and negative, before reading this book. Though I had two nights of hell (one of which culminated in my then 2 1/2 year old falling asleep on the rug by the door out of sheer exhaustion), on the third night she just asked if we could leave the door open. Now, 6 months later, she sleeps 10 hours a night, no problem. Occassionally, she'll wake up and want to sleep in my bed, but I just walk her back and tell her that when it's light out, she can come in. Not only will you learn how to help your child sleep through the night, you'll learn lots of interesting things about sleep patterns that will help you understand your child better. You owe it to yourself to read this book. Those who condemn Ferber are simply misreading his method.

For the price of one CD, you get over 2 hours of music on two CD's which happen to feature von Karajan's best performances of these great symphonies. I'm going through a romantic phase right now in my classical listening, so I'm into Tchaikovsky. All three of these symphonies are just tremendous -- loud and boisterous one minute and then sublime the next. The Penguin guide to classical music said that these were simply THE best recordings that Karajan did of these symphonies and after listening a few times, I believe it. The sound quality is not muddy, but it would be nice to have this exact recording with more perfect sound. Still, this is a minor bone to pick on this outstanding collection that manages to find great recordings of these 3 symphonies and gather them into one conveniently priced package. A great deal and many hours of listening pleasure.

Even more than artists like Celia Cruz, Estefan has popularized Cuban music and brought it into the mainstream. This is a well thought out album with many good songs, only a few fillers and a great beat. My only complaint, and I'm not trying to insult Estefan, is that there are other singers out there with a much better dynamic range (Celia Cruz, to name a big one). Still, you have to give her credit for boosting Cuban music sales and for doing a very solid job interpreting many classics and new works.

Reading these poignant stories is like watching 15 or so different versions of American Beauty. Beneath the surface in almost every family lie illness, infidelity, betrayals and anger. This is his first collection of stories and they make for an excellent collection. I had read his later books first like The Lost Language of Cranes which I think are stronger overall, but as a first collection, these stories are revealing.Leavitt has a knack for exposing the underside of family relations. Many of his stories focus on husbands who leave their wives, but just as many focus on the effect these family disputes have on the children. Overall, these stories will leave you with a feeling of sadness -- he touches many nerves from cancer to men coming to terms with their sexuality, to abandoned sisters and brothers. I think Leavitt is a very sensitive writer with an eye for the problems that plague 20th century families.

I liked this book more than the other one I read on the same race (although they are both worth reading). The race itself makes for an incredible story as scores of yachts headed out into one of the worst storms to ever hit the southern hemisphere. The author did a fantastic job of weaving together the stories and personalities of the various boats, the worsening storm and the groundbreaking rescue efforts. After reading both of these books, I can say that the Austrialisn Search and Rescue is the finest in the world.This book reminds me quite a bit of The Perfect Storm -- the format is similar: background information about the sailors, the WEATHER (which takes a central role), the race and the subsequent rescues (this last stage unfortunately never happened in Junger's book). I'm not a sailor, but the author explains enough about the terminology so that anyone can follow. Gripping from start to finish.

Even without the publishing mystery that stands in the background of this books's publication, it would still be an excellent book. It seems too facile to follow the Times lead and write it off as morally abject or high brow pornography. Sure, the book has sex right in the forefront, but it also holds poverty, despair and life in the projects right in your face. The fact that Chimo struggles after each incident to stay up by candlelight and try to capture in his diary what Lila says, shows that there is some salvation. The material can be a bit shocking. You'll never think of riding a bike the same way again! The first thing we hear Lila say to the narrator is, &quot;Do you want to see my pussy.&quot; If you're troubled, read no further. But, if you want to see beneath the outer layer of life in the projects in France, you'll want to keep reading.I don't want to give away the plot, but the scene in which Lila describes the devil to her pious aunt will have you alternating between laughing and crying, and the ending is well-suited to the novel.I don't know if I believe the story behind the book's publication, but whoever Chimo is, he/she has a powerful literary voice and a unique style.

Saramago deserved the noble prize for literature -- this is a master work of the highest order. Following the poetic tradition of blindness (Homer, Milton...), Saramago invents a world in which everyone is struck down by a &quot;white&quot; blindness. After initial government intervention to control the epidemic, things soon detiorate. The situation becomes a Lord of the Flies mixed with Dante's Inferno. In fact, this book has much in common with Dante for its vivid smells and sounds. The reader's overwhelming sensory impression is of the stench of excrement and vomit that piles up in every corner of this fetid environment. The rape scenes are horrifying, as is much of the behavior. Yet, their remains elements of humanity and that's what makes Saramago such a brilliant writer. He sees beyond the horror and finds redeeming moments throughout. Ironically, the person who experiences the most horror is the doctor's wife who is the only person who retains her sight and is forced to witness man's inhumanity against man.Reading this book is not always enjoyable (similar to reading about Holocaust atrocities), but it's so well written and so literary, that ultimately it attains a &quot;classic&quot; level that few books reach. Time will mark this a classic to be held up to Dante and Homer. Don't miss it.

Don't be put off by Eco's erudtion and medieval setting. This is a classic detective novel, summed up perfectly by Renoir (see below). Not only will you be drawn into 14th century Italy, you will learn about the what Eco is really talking about -- the semiotics of detective writing. Throughout all the arcane writing, Eco is talking about his theory of semiotics -- signs, to teach his readers how to cull the most important clues from his works. This is high brow entertainment -- I recommend the most annotated version you can find. Not many readers will be all that familiar with 14th century conventions, but with good footnotes, this book becomes all the more accessible. Eco is worth reading as one of the foremost literary critics/writers of his day.

This book emphasizes the importance of developing learning organizations and then proceeds to outline a 3 step approach to actually doing so in your own organization. The chapters are very specific and lay out the process so just about anyone could analyze where their organization is to start (the first step), where they'd like to go and how to get there.For knowledge officers, this book is a must read: it's easy to follow and clearly laid out with enough charts and examples to lead you through the process.

I was hanging out at my local Borders checking out the new 6 Degrees Travel Disc when I heard the first song by Ekova which blew me away. Instead of buying that CD, I went and found this Ekova album which I'm happy to say is consistently good throughout. She does remind me a bit of the Cocteau twins, but with much more of a mid-eastern twinge. This is upbeat, danceable and hypnotic music. I like the exotic combination of instruments (mostly real instruments, not heavy on snythizier which can get irritating) and voices -- the lead singer's voice is the real selling point here, but I have to compliment her two musicians too -- they are excellent. In fact, this is one of the best world music CD's I've heard in a long time. If you like exotic blends with a beat, you'll really enjoy this music. I'm glad I stumbled across it. As an added bonus, the packaging is very attractive not just on this CD but on all the 6 degrees Traveller's series.

This was one of my favorite books of the year. It's hard to fit into a genre: part suspense novel, part magic realism novel, part character study, it unfolds the story of a group of hostages and how their relationships form under duress. United by the musical leit motif, we watch as the characters are transformed through an almost magical attraction to opera music. My personal favorite of the memorable characters was Gen, the adept translator who finally finds his own voice. His relationship wtih his employer and how he breaks free for me was one of the most interesting parts of the novel. I can't think of a novel I've read recently with such an innovative and unusual plot. And unlike other novels I've read, the magic realism element never gets too heavy handed. In short, a terrific read.

Just because a writer produces many works should not mandate that we ignore new output -- like many of Oates' earlier works, the writing is breathtaking. I have to admit that since I'm in my early 30's, Marilyn Monroe per se holds little interest for me, but Oates' insights into the human condition and her winding prose held me to the very end of this 700 + page book. I would encourage readers who like well-written, literary works to give this a try even if the topic does not interest you. Its gives special pleasure to read the work of a great 20th century voice who is still living. Yes, much of the book is depressing, especially the early chapters about her attachment to her crazy mother and her search for love and affection. Despite the somber tone, the prose itself breathes life into the subject and shows hope. It made me want to find and read more of Oates' earlier works.

I agree with other reviewers who said this is slow going. Don't expect a thriller that takes 2 hours to read. I've been slogging away for days, although overall I enjoyed it. Not since Shuuuuhman McCoy (Bonfire of the Vanities) have I read such a memorable portrait of a flawed main character. My favorite part of the book was Turow's incredible creation of Robbie Feaver. At times you'll hate him, at times you'll sympathize with him. His absolute egoism combined with his sensivity and personal values make him fascinating as a character study.Turow provides such a detailed legal background that it almost overwhelms the reader. I can't help but think this book would have been stronger if it were a tad less overburdened by realistic details. Still, Turow does all his research and gives many readers a feel for the cruelest disease, ALS. The other villains and heroes are all interesting creations and well described. If you like intricate legal books, you won't be able to put this one down. You'll need to carry it around for awhile though to finish it.

For a first novel, Stafford does many things right -- the pacing is good, the Bahamas setting well-described and the plot gripping enough to keep you turning until the end. It's a quick read too. There are some signs of amateurism in the often clunky sounding dialogue and stock drug characters. At times I couldn't get away from the feeling that I was reading a writing workshop project rather than a published novel.I don't mean to dismiss this book though -- as I said, the plot is engrossing and the setting exotic enough to draw the reader through. A valient first attempt -- I suspect we'll see some more polished novels from the author in the near future!

I'm unqualified to judge the translation since I don't speak any French, but the play is very accessible. Although I have read many of the classic Greek plays, I never read anything by Racine. It's helpful to pick up a book on Racine like the Twayne's Masterworks series to find out some background information. Like many French authors, he grew up in poverty and ascended to power and prestige later. Several of his plays were based on Greek stories and plays -- in this one, he even quotes out of the originals. The plot line is easy to follow and very interesting, plus Phaedre strikes me as one of the most developed female characters around. Compare her depth to Dido's in Virgil's Aeneid and you'll see what I mean. This play is excellent and now I'm inspired to read more of Racine's wonderful plays which still have a modernness of theme about them. There are some moving speeches -- I'd like to see it performed. This edition also as the prefaces which are supposed to be included but aren't always.

First of all, if you haven't had the pleasure of reading any of the Norton Critical Editions of any famous works, always opt for them. As usual, this is a superb edition with tons of scholarly material and background information. If you like Greek history, it's hard to find anything that you would not like about Herodotus's histories. Many consider him the father of all history, and after you read him, you'll see why. On top of being a great historian, you'll find plenty of personal anecdotes about the Romans' escapes in Egypt, Cyrus's mistakes and achievments, and Xerxes' victories. This will make you a quick expert in Greek history and will entertain you with anecdotes from the Greek forays into Africa and the Mediterrean. You'll never think of any of the Greek leaders the same way again after you read Herodotus' gossip column account. You can't always trust him, but it's much more entertaining than Thucydides's histories.

This first few tracks will have you leaping out of your seat. Pintame los labios is one of my favorites from this excellent CD which except for one or two less than stellar songs is one of the best of the Buena Vista discs. This is authentic son/son montuno -- I love the selection of songs picked for the album. If you've never heard the tres played before, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD. An important part of any good Cuban collection and good sound quality too.

I'm generally not one for self help books because I think the majority of them are money making endeavors that offer little real help. I've heard about Chopra for years, perhaps the most known doctor in America besides Dr. Spock. I've picked up his books many times to be greeted by the perfect family shot of him, his wife and handsome son. For some reason I never could bring myself to read him. So finally, I bit the bullet and read The Seven Laws for Parents.I feel guilty criticizing a book with such noble intentions. I mean, who can criticize a book that espouses spending thoughtful time with your children and family, encourages being thoughtful and considerate, and asks us all to foster our spiritual being and self? For this message, I certainly do not fault Chopra. No one would. But do I think that he has anything unique to say or that by summarizing our lives into seven laws all our parenting woes are gone? Certainly not. These books have a popular appeal because they are simply written, teach good values, and provide some concrete advice for parents. But somewhere along the line, I feel betrayed by the "industry" of Chopra, his institutes, seminars and programs. This book contains many fairly obvious points - I guess I'd call it "parenting 101 light." Nothing bad about it, but nothing special either. Perhaps the word &quot;oversimplification&quot; sums it up best. It's a 20 minute read at best and could just as easily be found in Cosmo Magazine as in book form. It's the reader's digest version or the classic comics of real literature, but at least its message is worthwhile. Don't get me wrong -- parents can benefit from following the practices in this book. The success of this book and his other 7 habit book shows that many are just looking for a quick 7 step solution to solving their problems. This the book will not do.

This whole series of parenting books are extremely helpful. Sure, every once in a while you say to yourself, &quot;this is just commonsense,&quot; but what makes these books great is that they give so many true to life examples with ideas about how to respond. Even the most patient of us sometimes snaps at our children, but these books teach you how to formulate productive ways to deal with tough situations. If you've ever experienced a supermarket temper tantrum, you'll need to order this overnight mail to find out how to cope. Every day care center in the country should make this required reading.

I have to confess that I read this book years ago, but like many great books, it stays with you over the years. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night thinking of Tom Wingo or Savannah -- some criticize Conroy for not being &quot;literary&quot; -- he may not be Faulkner, but he's a fine writer and a great storyteller. I thought he might be a one-hit wonder, but after loving 5-6 of his other novels as well, I'm convinced that he's the real thing. Don't be a snob about Conroy -- I've rarely met someone who didn't love this book.

I don't mean to complain, but I was very disappointed by this book. first of all, it doens't really "teach" you photoshop -- it provides recipes to do things so you can do them without learning. For example, he doesn't tell you how to make a layer or where the command is, he just gives you the shortcut which is not helpful for a beginner trying to figure out HOW to do basic tasks and where you can find those taks in the menu bar. But then again, I guess this book isn't for beginners. My other grips is that I read through all the tips, but then I realized that for me, a photographer mostly of my own family, I didn't need ANY of these tips -- I'm not creating a magazine, a CD cover, etc.. -- just family pics. So, if you want a quick recipe for doing neat text things and effects, this is the book for you. If you want to LEARN how to use the program or fix your photographs in non-gimmicky ways, you should buy a different book. This book will be great for designers or those who want to see how to produce high tech effects, but for just photographers, it's not the best.

Maybe if I hadn't just read 10 other much stronger adventure books, I would have been more impressed by this one, but in comparison to these, this one is much weaker. The Sydney Hobart Race is certainly interesting and the weather conditions among the worst on earth, but the writer never got beyond the illusion that he was trying too hard to recreate something he didn't know much about. After reading the review below from a sailor who was actually in the race, I started to understand his point of view. There are certainly some fun parts here: the Australian SAR vignettes are riveting and serve to remind us how strong Austrailia is in this regard. The focus of this book is definitely more in the rescues than the sailing. This book was much less well written (not to mention poorly edited with many typos and inaccuracies) and less vivid than the others. For those looking for the creme de la creme, I recommend Lundy's The Godforsaken Sea.

I'm a fan of Millhauser thanks to Martin Dressler, but this was not one of my favorite works. Sure, there are beautiful poetic sections weaved in and out of these night musings. Many of his recurrent themes, (moonlight, a mannequin who gets up and wanders around) make there way through these meditations on night and the stories are interwoven. But overall, I found that these little segments don't cohere enough to make this a truly great work. Full of little gems, to be sure, but more like a literary experiment than a novella to be savored. I'm glad he continues to experiment and push the bounds of fiction, but I found this small volume a bit disappointing overall.

This is my first Hamilton book and I found it absorbing enough to want to reach the end. The writing is very good in places, but I have to admit that the reviewer below hit the nail on the head regarding the book's fatal flaw -- Henry never sounds like the &quot;real&quot; narrator -- I kept feeling that I was reading Hamilton's voice channeled through a 20 something male. I found Kevin, the father, to be the most interesting character of the novel. In his own quiet way (nothing like the flamboyant Elvira or the restless mother), he keeps the family together and waits for his wife to return to him. He was the only character I felt for -- the others are a remarkably unsympathetic lot. I think if Hamilton hadn't been famous before this novel, no one would have been very interested in it. I was impressed in parts, but overall it's pretty mediocre.

The title would lead you to believe that this book is for anyone who wants to get an idea of how Latin works. When you actually read it, you'll see it's really more of a grammar book that quickly explains many major grammar points and lists all declensions, verb conjugations, etc.... For someone who has never studied Latin, the information is not comprehensive enough to really learn it, plus it assumes that you have a pretty good head for grammar in the first place.However, this book is much more useful for someone who has already studied a year or so of Latin and is searching for some non-stuffy explanations and examples of what they have already learned. The authors certainly aim to make these points more fun than authors of traditional textbooks. The problem is that sometimes you need a deeper explanation to really learn a point -- take the subjunctive for example. In my opinion they just gave an overview of the subjuctive which gives the student a rough idea, but to really master the subjunctive, you'd need to see a real list of rules and tenses. My favorite Latin textbook is the Moreland and Fleisher which is the comprehensive version of all Latin syntax and grammar broken up into 18 chapters. This book is a good supplement to a grammar text, but not a replacement for one.

I can't name another movie that had me laughing from the opening moments to the very end without stopping. I saw this a few years ago when it first came out. Now that it's in video, I've rented it again and it's still funny. Guest is hilarious as a small town director with high aspirations. For my money, this is even funnier than Spinal Tap and holds up better as a mock-umentary. Everyone is in the groove here and every performance is noteworthy. For fans of Guest, be sure not to miss this year's Best in Show which he also directs. You'll get to watch him play a macho guy with a southern drawl who is in love with his bloodhound! Don't miss this film either if you're in the mode for a good laugh and some seriously funny film-making.

Ekova's Heaven's Dust was one of my favorite CD's. This one is great in its own way. The music is hypnotic and shares many of the dreamy qualities of the first CD but with a more electronic feel. I'm an acoustic nut, so in some ways I thought the first CD was better, but this one is growing on me. It's a bit less accessible upon first listen, but once you really listen for a while, you'll love it if you like this kind of music. Unlike the first album, it doesn't have one great hit (like Starlight in Daarden), but many interesting and exotic songs. I should add that the cover art and design are beautiful and make me want to open and hold this CD. Ekova is certainly one of the most exciting group for this kind of exotic and wild sounding music!

The reviewer below who said that if you are looking for crime fiction you should skip this book is right. This is more along the lines of a book like the Professor and the Madman or Longitude. The strongest parts of the narrative revolve around the exploration of map collectors and the map world. The portrait of the brash Arader is worth the price of admission. Being somewhat of a geek myself, I loved all the library tales too -- I remember being in the Rare book room at Dartmouth and noting how easy it would be to steal or ruin priceless manuscripts. You'll learn all about the insular world of map collecting, libararies (great portrait of the Peabody) and those who fananatically devote themselves to mapmaking. I also love the idea of the Island of Maps: the FBI's collection of hundreds of maps that Bland had stolen. The author looks with awe as he sees hundreds of famous maps just piled up in an FBI storage area looking lost. At some points, this book recalled some of Eco's works like the Island of the Day Before.I found the authors ruminations towards the end of the book interesting, but agree that overall they might have been saved for another venue. Overall this is a fascinating read, not to mention a beautiful book to look at it. If he wanders a bit, at least he makes the diversions enjoyable.

It's hard to imagine a first time reader of this classic sitting down in a chair, reading it and saying, Oh, now I know why it's great. It's more likely than this reader would throw the book down and ask what the fuss is about. But, if you've seen any production of it or tried to read the dialogue out loud, it can really make a huge difference. Even the expression &quot;waiting for Godot&quot; has taken on a mythic meaning in cultures around the world. You cannot summarize the &quot;point&quot; of the play in one pithy sentence, but the play will make you think about whether what happens between the two protagonists is what is important, or the imminent arrival of Godot. Beckett takes such a simple idea and makes it contain the answers to all the big questions. If nothing else, the play will make you think about how we pass time, how we process information and where the focus is in our own lives -- what is the point and is there a point? That is why the play has achieved worldwide literary status, at least in my humble opinion.

This book proved to be an excellent one to read right after Galileo's Daughter -- after reading of G's struggle to stay within the bounds of the church (he had no problem with a struggle for faith -- he knew he was right about the sun being at the center), it's refreshing to read of a near contemporary who was much more conflicted. Pascal was one of the great geniuses of all time -- if you study math at all, you'll realize the extend of his scope and reach. His talents crossed into other fields as well. Unfortunately, like Galileo (although I think worse), he was very sickly for much of his life. Sometimes, he could barely get down a &quot;pensee&quot; because it hurt so much to write. No surprise then that many are short jottings or musings on many aspects of Christian faith. One doesn't have to be a Christian to understand one man's struggles to reconcile what he saw in the world around him to his scientific and mathematical discoveries. There are infinite nuggets of wisdom in these pages. Sure, he misinterprets the bible a lot, but he was blazing a trail in criticism of translation that he didn't have primary sources for.Like a Bartlett's book of quotations, this book is best read in small doses or it becomes too much. The book takes the form of many small comments and analysis, a notebook written in shorthand if you will. This translation allows us a look inside one of the greatest thinkers of all time.

I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed by this novel and I say this after having read all of Eco's other novels over the years. The sub plot with the Hepatia kept me interested for awhile, but the central device of having Baudolino narrate his entire story while under siege in Istanbul didn't hold up. It's as if Eco needs lots of complicated narrative devices when sometimes they actually interfere with the telling of the story. Not that the novel isn't extremely clever, historically accurate (although I'm hardly a scholar of that period) and captivating in parts with its erudition, but sometimes it felt like knowledge more to show off than for its own sake. Parts of the middle of the novel are actually downright boring and with the whole murder plot, the novel turns into a bit of a shaggy dog story. Devout Eco fans should give it a try and will enjoy many parts, but as a whole, it's slow, a bit tedious in parts and overly pedantic. It's one of those novels you'll be glad you read, but it may not seem so until you've plowed through it.

Although I do have some smaller criticisms, I want to make clear that I did enjoy Morris' 2nd volume very much. His writing makes you feel like you are living through each and every presidential crisis from the Panama Canal to Cuba to the brink of war between other nations. That same benefit has one small drawback -- at times, it was just a few too many details for me. That is to say that the subject grew out of focus as the events took center stage. For many, that will be a plus, not a minus but for me, I wanted more personal info about Roosevelt and not every single interaction he had with foreign ambassadors. The chapters that focused on Edith and Alice were terrific, but we don't get to see much as Teddy the father. I also loved the famous hunt description (that led to a pathetic roping of a bear, hence "Teddy Bear") and many of the personal anecdotes. I know my next book will be the first volume since his early childhood always fascinated me.Morris' research is impeccable -- you will be a fly in the wall for every event that took place in R's administration. I also think Morris did a fair job showing both his faults and his strengths -- he could be a bully at times, a boor, but also an incredibly charming and diplomatic man. You will come out of this book knowing infinitely more about the time period and the man himself. Overall, an exacting and detailed biography that at times gets weighed under by minutiae (although that minutiae will be fodder for true historians).

I'm not very familiar with Indian music, but this CD sounds very authentic to me. The DJ writes sincere liner notes explaining that he is trying to perserve the sanctity of the Indian music while bringing in modern touches. Don't worry -- it's not a pulsing techno-beat kind of CD. It sounds much more traditional. I love the combination of instruments and the blend of voices. I've only listened to it once so far, but it's very captivating music. My ear is getting accustomed to it still. I've been really happy with all the 6 degree traveller CD's I've found so far. This should prove even better upon repeated listening.

Unlike most poetry books, this one focuses on the poet's insights into his/her own work and some very accessible poems by modern poets. Moyers refuses to get bogged down in the technique of poetry (rhyming, meter, scansion, etc...) and instead focuses on each author's comments and explications of his own work. Each chapter picks one poet and starts with his/her reading at the festival and then an informal Q and A that sheds light into how poets become poets. No surprises here -- most who write it can't think how they could NOT have written, even at an early age. In some cases, poetry literally rescued their authors from their borderline lives. For anyone interested in the creative process, this is an easy to follow and enlightening short volume on poetry and poems.

This book is like a one-stop shopping guide to Adult education. It is so comprehensive that I doubt it leaves out one development in the history of adult education. My only warning is that the opening chapters which basically trace many theories of learning (both adult and traditional) are hard to get through -- it reads more like a research paper that summarizes every major educational theory since the beginning of time. But, if you don't want to know that much, you can simply skip these chapters and get right to the meat of the adult learning theories which are more appropos. For those who need a quick primer on learning theories, you'll love the first few chapters for their abundance of quick summary information. A useful guide to adult education.

This slim volume will only occupy an hour or two of your time, but I guarantee that you will be fully engrossed. Others have summarized the plot line well enough -- most of what we read is from Patricia's journal which she keeps while hidden away in a remote part of Ireland. The &quot;drama&quot; is more in the emotion and her recollections of encounters with art than in the art-heist plot. Though we don't get as much information as we want, the ending is satisfying and the novella so well crafted that the worst complaint you may have is that there is not more of it. By the end, you will also have an incredible urge to find a book of Vermeer's paintings and study them up close.

Even more than the many fine poems cited in this wonderful anthology, I enjoyed the eloquent responses by everyday Americans as to why they responded in certain ways to their favorite poems. These stories are almost as moving as the actual poems and there are dozens of terrific poems, both the familiar and the unexpectedly novel. If you only read the comments, you'd be a richer person, but to read the comments along with the poems, now that's an experience. If this book were required in English classes around the country, maybe kids wouldn't resent poetry units so much!

Like The Marriage of Sticks, The Wooden Sea takes place in the fictional town of Crane's View (which sounds suspiciously like a Western Westchester town like Hastings on Hudson or Ossining). This tale is told through the eyes of the chief of police who during his morning routine suddenly finds strange things happening to him in the town: childhood smells pop up from nowhere, a 3 legged pit bull, a beautiful feather and a bone to name a few. As it turns out, our chief was a hell-raiser as a child, a detail that becomes important as we start to meet different version of his character at different ages. I like the almost Platonic philosophical bent of the latter half of the book - as usual in Carroll's books, we rove through time zones, other realities, and a plot that resists summary. I find this one of his "deeper" books - a kind of Unified Particle Theory view of the world. Now that I found the reissue of his first book, the Land of Laughs, I can say that I've finished all of Carroll's books. The Wooden Sea is definitely one of his better books, although fans should read them all. And buy yourself a hardcover copy because they go out of print fast! Carroll remains one of my all time favorite authors and if you haven't had a chance to try him, don't wait any longer.

By far the best part of this excellent novel is the middle section about life in China. The recreation of Chinese peasant life, the fascinating tour into calligraphy and the art of fine ink-making, the discovery of Peking man -- this is the stuff of great novels. It makes me wish Tan would devote a whole book to more traditional Chinese tales without the mother-daughter immigrant adjustment theme that runs through all her books. Don't get me wrong -- it works here and the relationship between Ruth and her mother is not by any means an exact replica of relationships in her other novels. There are many new twists. Despite other criticisms, I found the book fast reading and gripping once you get past some of the preliminary chapters. Since many Americans are interested in Chinese history and Tan recreates eras so well, I'd like to put in a request to see her next book take place entirely in China. Tan should be commended for branching out from her familiar territory and writing such a good story.

I love this book. My daughter (3 ) could not stop howling with laughter as we read this book about five times in a row. By the fifth or so reading, she'd memorized it (not that hard to do since we just count down the number of monkeys jumping on the bed: "five little monkeys, jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped his head, mama called the doctor and the doctor said, No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" How could you not laugh after reading this book? Plus, the illustrations with the little monkeys are adorable. The other ones in the series are not nearly as good as this one, so if you only buy one, make it the original five little monkeys.

Unlike the Cheb CD I just reviewed, this one IS memorable and interesting. I only knew Atlas from Putumayo's Arabic Groove but based on good write ups, I bought his one. Unlike the Cheb CD, this one sounds much more regionally authentic. Her voice is great and memorizing at times. This CD is addictive. I've listened to it lots already and find all the tracks strong. Definitely worth buying if you're into World Music, Arabic in particular. Atlas' voice is flowing and sensual.

After all the fancy All-Clad pots I own, this one is becoming my new favorite. For some things like searing meat, only cast iron does such a fine job. The only thing I'd point out to buyers is that this pan is bigger than it looks. If I'd bothered to measure first, I would have gone with the 10 inch skillet instead of this one, but that's my own fault! This one is big and VERY heavy, but after seasoning it, it's awesome for cooking. Try a fajita or a nice seared steak!

It says a lot that of all the books we read during the year in a rigorous English curriculum, many of my best readers picked the Pinksy Inferno as their favorite book of the year. I'm a Mandelbaum fan too (I still like his Aeneid since it's by far the closest to Virgil's Latin and was even helpful when I worked on translating books 4 and 6), but I prefer Pinsky's rendition of Dante's poem. It makes the text alive for generations of new readers. My class appreciated Nicole Pinsky's notes at the end of the book which add greatly to students' comprehension of historical background and context. Hats off to Pinsky for a great work of art that has made Dante more accessible to a new generation of potential fans.

Years ago I read an article in The New Yorker (or maybe New York Magazine -- it's been awhile) about Harold Bloom's nocturnal pattern of staying up all night and reading. He apparently required only a few hours of sleep and spent the rest of his days and nights devouring books. On a typical night, he'd read 2-3 novels! We should be grateful that perhaps the most prolific reader of all time and an academic is able to magnanimously share his reflections in a jargon-free idiom so unlike most literary criticism. His prose is always clear and free of lit. crit. vocabulary that only a specialist would know. For that reason alone, this book is a terrific read -- it makes the reader want to go out and buy all the novels discussed and read them. What could be a better effect that a book that generates increased reading? I've enjoyed the five or so books I've read by Harold Bloom not to mention his &quot;Bloom's Notes&quot; series on great literary works that puts Cliffs Notes to shame. His literary knowledge is so deep and so wide that everyone, even teachers who spent years teaching these books, can pick up some useful information. I particularly enjoyed his emphasis on memorizing poetry and the effect it can have on one's life. He made me run, not walk, to pick up Stendal's The Charterhouse of Parma which I can't wait to read.

I admire the author for attacking a popular afro-centric theory and totally demolishing it. Seldom have I read such a satisfying account that at once attacks and totally destoys a popular academic account. I was somewhat skeptical of the afro-centric accounts to start, but after I finished this book, I was convinced that Lefkovitz was 100% correct. A well-written and very well argued book that will win over even the most Afro-centrist critics if they can absorb and read her insights.

Granted, it must be impossible to live up to the reputation once you have already produced a series of masterful novels. I think Helprin is one of the very finest 20th century writers in English. A Winter's Tale and A Soldier of the Great War (and Antproof) are some of the finest pieces of fiction ever written. I have to admit that I found The Refiner's Fire much weaker than his other books, but I'm still glad I read it. It's heartening to know that even true geniuses have trouble maintaining this level of achievement 100% of the time. Still worth reading for serious Helprin fans.

The more you play this album, the more you will appreciate its depth, subtlety and beauty. I love the old U2 stuff the best (War -- one of my favorite songs of all time is Seconds) like War, Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, etc... I bought Zootropa, Rattle and Hum and Achtung, but I didn't LOVE them the same way I loved the first few. Finally with this album, my love affair with U2 can resume. Is Bono the only musician who can hit so many flat notes and make them sound so damn good? So many great tunes on this one -- I love Elevation, Kite, New York, and Grace. Grace has that same lyric quality of one of my other favorites, Running to Stand Still. The truth is, almost every song is great, and the ones that aren't are still damn good. The only bad news is that there's no way they'll be able to produce a better album. Even if you haven't listened to U2 in a while, buy this one right away and listen to it several times to warm yourself up for the experience.

This is the perfect little book for anyone who prefers reading to TV watching. Fadiman grew up in a reading family where their favorite pastime was grilling each other about the origins of quotations. "Like the young Van Dorens, the Fadiman children were ritually asked to identify literary quotations. While my mother negotiated a honking traffic jam on an L.A. freeway... my father would mutter, `We are here as on a darkling plain...' and Kim and I would squeal in chorus, `Dover Beach.'"While some might find this egocentric, I was enthralled with their literary banter. My family used to hold similar competitions on words and quotes, and of course we played Jeopardy! against each other for years. There are many excellent essays in this collection - I particularly loved one of her funniest essays on plagiarism in which she swamps the readers with a multitude of superfluous footnotes. Another hilarious essays details her encounter with the legendary William Shawn (New Yorker) who tried not to embarrass her for not knowing the correct pronunciation of the "Ms." in Ms. Magazine. This is a book to be savored while sipping tea, reclined in a favorite reading chair in the family library.

I don't know enough about the mathematics of fractals to agree with the reader below who points out the author's lack of qualifications, but even with small mistakes like those, the book is a terrific introduction that requires no technical background. The author does an excellent job explaining not just how fractals were discovered and how to calculate them, but also how artists, writers, poets, and scientist use this information to explain and interpret the world around them. Most books I've read on fractals have a narrow focus. Also, with so many illustrations (this is a gorgeous book), layman explanations and far reaching applications, even the average reader can appreciate the beauty and power of fractals. I could not put it down and then had to start all over again!

I've long been a fan of Rey's (of Curious George fame) The Stars, a New Way to See them, but that is a bit more complex and geared towards adults and advanced students. This book is ideal for children and parents alike because Rey breaks down the major constellations one by one and draws them so they look like real pictures, not like those horrible drawings in the NY Times and other publications. His lion looks like a lion! The text is very basic, easy to follow and explains the basic astro stuff like stars, planets, magnitudes, but not much more. The major reason to buy this book if you already have his other book is for the handy sky charts. Unlike his more advanced book which has an entire sky map, this book as more handy "sky view" charts which are an easier way to learn the night sky. Another winner from H.A. Rey that anyone can profit from if interested in learning the stars!

We read this classic outloud in my high school class this year and my students could not believe how modern the themes were. Everyone can relate to the detective element (many critics claim this as the first true detective plot), the search for truth, the irony (the very definition of dramatic irony is Oedipus) and the gripping plot. I would also like to add that as always the Norton editions are by the far the best available. They have terrific background information and a great collection of pertinent essays. They make scholars out of just regular readers. If you never read Oedipus, buy it now!

I'm on somewhat of a sailing/adventure kick these days, and this book is full of great adventure. Unlike The Godforsaken Sea which is populated by hugh and high tech yachts, this book features the Sparrow, a tiny 25 foot sailboat built by the father and son who sail it. Therefore, their adventure is even more incredible. Lundy even refers to it in The Godforsaken Sea with some awe. Occassionally, you may get sick of some of the personal reflections of the son, but overall, I enjoyed their personal reflections. More than the family bonding, I enjoyed the day to day details: the huge lists, the small tasks that fill the sailing day, the meticulous descriptions of storms and weather -- this is what made the book vivid. For anyone who enjoys this kind of sailing adventure, this book is a must read. I'm still amazed that they made it with some of the tremendous risks they took. An enduring tale of man against nature.

From the opening song, this is a perfect album. Even my 4 year old loves it and dances around the room when I play it. The guitar is beautiful, as are the melodies and the arrangements. It's very accessible -- everyone I've played it for has really enjoyed it. I listen to lots of African music -- this is pure and intense with no weak filler tracks. Great sound quality too.

I love Junger's book, not just as a fan, but as an English teacher who has used it to turn many non-readers into readers. It combines history, background information and adventure into a real page turner. I'm a vicarious storm freak (you know, the type who lives for the Discovery Channels live footage of tornados) who never wants to be out in one, but loves reading about them. This has to be one of my favorite adventure books of all time. I read it when it first came out, but my memory of &quot;rogue waves&quot; is still going strong. Buy it for someone you know who doesn't like to read.

Usually I find Bloom's books very helpful in understanding difficult works and authors. However, in this collection, all the essays are geared toward more serious scholars of Eliot's works, rather than toward the general reader looking for more information. Yes, the editor includes some standard and well known essays about Eliot by the likes of Hugh Kenner, Northrop Frye, Richard Ellmann (Joyce's biographer) and some modern critics, but there is nothing that holds these essays together. It would have been better to organize the essays around particular works -- instead, we get a brief look at Ash Wednesday, a bit on the Wasteland, some other random poems, you get the idea. Many of these essays are outdated by now. If you are a graduate student writing your thesis on Eliot, these essays may be useful, but for the general high school student or adult who justs wants some help with understanding Eliot, try a more user-friendly series like the Twayne's Masterworks, or Norton Critical Editions.

Maybe it was the Henry V tie ins that hooked me, or the unusually sharp barbs hurled at Wall Street Icons... either way, These fools are anything but. Plus, you don't have to be a brilliant analyst of a mathematician to put their easy to follow rules into practice. Not only is the book entertaining, it's interesting and informative too. In fact, I have this incredible urge to round up some funds and invest right away following their principles. I've always been intimidated by stocks, but after reading their book, at least I feel that I know the right questions to ask. I just bought one of their earlier books which I will read to learn even more. If nothing else, you can understand why mutual funds are such poor investments compared to stocks.

I wasn't quite as enthralled as other reviewers, but perhaps that has more to do with my recent infatuation with Cook's Illustrated Magazine which I think is the most incredible reference around -- they have a book also called The Best Recipe. To me, that book is more of a general reference than Child's. Still, this book has lots of general recipes and techniques that make it a good reference book to have around if you just want to know at what temperature to roast a duck and for how long.Maybe this is an odd gripe, but there were some pretty fancy recipes here for a basic reference. I found the meat and potato stuff very helpful, but the advanced dishes way beyond what I'm capable of. I also would have liked more pictures of some of the things she described (Cook's Illustrated is the BEST) -- from her description of how to shake the omelet pan, I needed a visual. If you like to book, this is a good book to have around, but don't miss The Best Recipe either.

There's no way to say a negative word about this book without offending scores of fans who worship every word Evans has ever written. So, with apologies, my opinion. As a story, the book is fine. Anyone would cry when reading about the death of a beloved child, especially if you have children. The love story is appealing: rich boy finds happiness with secretary. What's not to like? I think the main review above points out the book's flaws: cardboard characters, poor writing (as in the above example about the whiskey breathed evil men) and cliches left and right. Of course our noble narrator is a friend to the negroes (unlike the other stereotypical characters who drink a lot and seem to find the very thought repulsive) and goes out of his way to save Lawrence, the watchmaker. I felt used by the time I finished this book -- walked through a very predictable and emotional plot with little real depth. As a light read, there's nothing wrong with it, but it does show a certain lack of sophistication. Readers looking for a quick hankie read will enjoy this (don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed parts of it too), but those looking for great literature should venture beyond this genre of wish-fulfillment along the lines of the much worse Bridges of Madison County. There, I've probably done it now and offended millions of readers who thought the latter was great literature too. I suppose this book is harmless, but with such generalizations and stock characters and poor writing, I was left with an empty feeling.

Maybe I should a lyrical piece of poetry because Berry is more of a poet than a novelist -- this is one of the most beautifully written novels I've come across. Every page seems to have a passage worthy of underlining and coming back to. Other have summarized well the fictional life of the narrator, Jayber, who takes on a mental and spiritual journey through his childhood, adventures and later life with such gorgeous prose that you won't be able to put it down. In the beginning the author warns that we shouldn't try to deconstruct or interpret the book as that would ruin it. With such lovely prose and elegiac style, I'd hate to give anything else away except to urge anyone who loves a coming of age story and great writing to rush out and buy it. This is the first Berry book I've read, but it was highly recommended to me by a very strong reader friend and as usual, she was right on the mark! The last page had such an aching quality that most readers will find themselves reading it over and over, sad that such a fine book as come to a close.

My closest friend has been urging me for years to read Trollope and finally bought me a copy of The Warden. Maybe it's like The Hobbit in relation to the Lord of the Rings -- I found the Warden slow moving and tedious, but I could see that the next books in the series could be promising. I haven't given up on Trollope, I just find writers like Jane Austen and the Brontes much more exciting in both their writing and their plotlines. Still, there were sections I really enjoyed, but overall I was a bit disappointed.

I must say I'm a bit surprised by the vicious attacks launched at Cunningham, especially by readers who admit they have not read anything by Woolf -- there is the first mistake. Though I haven't read Mrs. Dalloway in quite a while, I have read To the Lighthouse (one of my all time favorite novels) and Cunningham captures her genius perfectly! This book demands a certain amount of concentration on the reader's behalf, but it's worth it. If you have ever read anything by Woolf, you will immediately appreciate the nuance of his language. It's not pompous just because he gets the prosody and rhythm of Woolf right on the nose! Normally I don't like split narratives that jump from chapter to chapter, but Cunningham does it so seamlessly and with such a feel for the 3 main characters that I found myself drawn into all three story lines. I don't want to reveal how they all come together, but let's just say they do, and with a bang. To give an idea of the kind of subtlety Cunningham displays, let me give one example: Lara Brown, the housewife, feels unconnected to her husband and 3 year old child and all she wants to do is finish reading Mrs. Dalloway. But, since it's her husband's birthday, she follows the expected role and tries to make him a fantastic cake. When the cake turns out to be amateurish and imperfect, she becomes almost suicidally depressed and decides to throw it out and start again. The scene continues, but the disappointment with the cake takes on a life of its own. Readers of To the Lighthouse will be reminded of the central dining scene when Mrs. Ramsey prepares a magnificant feast in much the same vein for her family. Cunningham's writing and grasp of Woolf is inspired -- I can see why he got the Pulitzer Prize. For those who criticize, be sure to catch up on your Woolf before nailing Cunningham to the cross. It's really a terrific book.

Having been a fan of McCorkle's writing since July 7th, I found this collection just a bit disappointing overall although there were some excellent stories (Final Vinyl Days, Your Husband is Cheating on Us, It's a Funeral, RSVP). Perhaps the reason lies in the fact that in her novels, the quirky characters have a chance to be fleshed out more and grow on us. In a short story, sometimes these odd characters sound gimmicky and 2 dimensional. Still, there are several scenes that will make you laugh out loud and some characters are very well sketched. Overall, these stories are solid, but if you have not read anything by McCorkle before, it may be better to start with July 7th and then try some of her short stories.

The best feature of Baker's writing is his rapier wit (not to mention his exquisite language). I died laughing during parts of this book. Baker is a terrific writer (and a daring one). This is the best time you'll ever have reading daring sexual material. I sought out all of Baker's books and it didn't surprise me that he has many witty and insightful critical essays as well. After this book and Vox, he's become one of my favorite all time writers.

I'm a total Carroll junkie and have read all of his books. This one struck me as quite different -- less dependence on the usual devices of elevators that take you to different places and more emphasis on dealing with the big questions, life and death. Carroll combines several mystic/religious traditions in defining his own cosmology of Chaos versus the Mosaic of life, all while creating his usual memorable characters and compelling love stories. In some ways this book was more satisfying, or perhaps more optimistic -- love conquers for a change. The idea of the unborn son having the power to save the world is a nice tie in -- in short, Carroll journeys farther from the "normal" path (not that anything is ever normal in a Carroll book!) and takes us on a memorable ride. Carroll remains one of the most innovative writers of our time -- don't miss his other books either!

Okay, do you think you'll ever have to wonder how to get an alligator to release whatever is in its mouth (i.e., your limb)? Then, this book is for you. (Tap it on on the snout so it will automatically open its jaws). My only complaint is that I wish the book were longer. I read it in 30 minutes and wished the authors had included even more interesting information about how to escape from extreme situations. I couldn't help feeling it was somewhat of a gimmicky book because of it short length -- many readers would naturally be intrigued, but the book could have been much more inclusive in its selection of death-defying situations. Definitely entertaining, but left me wanting more.

Unlike other reviewers below, I haven't read the author's other books, so I have to judge this one on its own merit. As far as his knowledge, he provides an excellent overview of various jazz styles and competent quick bios of the major players. My problem is with the pastiche-like feel of the book. It feels like the author slapped together a whole bunch of short encyclopedia articles, added some musical commentary and bang, had a book. At times it feels less than professional -- he mentions the drug and dope band thing about 20 times, plus a bit of namedropping on all his personal meetings with Miles.Despite the fact it reads a bit like a late night college paper, I did learn a lot about jazz history, the lives of the players and the mood of the album. The author knows his stuff in this regard. If you're a big fan of the album, you'll cull some interesting information from this book. Don't let the small writing problems get in your way.

My only minor complaint about this book is the somewhat ponderous middle section devoted to Mattias' wife's letters as she slides deeper and deeper into depression. I think the author probably did that on purpose, but after the very lively first hundred pages that snag the reader into a terrific story about the world of libraries and archives, it was somewhat of a dramatic change to be stuck in the middle. I enjoyed the meta-critical style of this book -- stories about stories woven into other stories: T.S. Eliot's letters, his wife's mental breakdown, Mattias' wife's breakdown and her letters, etc... I'm surprised that people called this book pretentious -- clearly Cooley is a sharp reader of Eliot's. Unless it's really overdone, I hardly ever complain that a book is TOO literary -- I feel lucky enough that she includes some of his finest poems like The Four Quartets. The judith section, though ponderous, is haunting. She can't get beyond the fact that the Holocaust happened and people did not want to acknowledge it. Because of her background and her poetic sensibility, she just can't get over it. The character's are tightly drawn and convincing. The main characters struggle to express his emotions brings back shades of The Remains of the Day. I don't want to spoil the ending, so I hope these brief comments are enough to get you to read this fine book. I read it all in one night.

Though Jaffe's novel is far from perfect (weak writing in parts that sounds contrived, some plot strands that just don't work out), let's dwell on the bright side. He captures quite well the frustrations and joys of parenthood. Even the most patient parent occassionaly feels like smacking his/her child at times. Calvin is a cute 4 year old who becomes enamoured of the Portuguese Man of War that his grandmother sends him in a jar! In one of the funniest scenes in the book, they make a trip to a doctor friend who treats the decaying jellyfish and adds formaldyhide which prolongs the creatures jar life a few more days. The love interest part of the book works, although we never find out much about her, but the scenes when his exwife comes back just don't seem to hang together. There were times that the writing sounded &quot;workshoppy&quot; to me. In short, this novel is worth reading for some poignant moments and sweet scenes, but it has several weaknesses that interfere with the novel as a whole.

I have to admit that I'm becoming addicted to the idiot's guides. Contrary to their title, they help experts and idiots alike. For the novice, most of this material may be new, but even the expert can pick up some great tips. The book is divided into the major office programs: Word, Outlook, Access, Powerpoint and Excel. Though individual books focus in more detail on each of these programs, there is certainly enough information here to do the majority of projects that most people would be inclined to do. The great thing about these guides is that you will suddenly find yourself unable to unlock a much higher potential of these powerful programs, particularly in Excel. The chapter on Excel is very easy to follow and teaches you how to do the most common formulas like autosum. Even regular Word users will perfect the art of making tables, even for such common items as resumes. The format is extremely readable and easy to follow. I find that these guides only take a few hours to read, but the effects last for months. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a quick refresher course on the most common features of these office programs.

I've had to read a slew of leadership books for my doctorate -- as for a collection of thoughtful essays, this is one of the best. It's well organized, well laid out and has almost every major thinker represented. It's got theoretical parts, practical parts and questions for down the road. The essays span all types of learning organizations: schools, hospitals, companies, etc... It's a bit long, but if you take it piece by piece, this is a very enjoyable and informative collection. Highly recommended and well-conceived.

I've liked many Madonna songs over the years and have always marvelled at her ability to reinvent herself over and over. This album is no exception -- once again, she makes other pop stars look like amateurs as she puts together another hip album. I'm not a techno or trance fan, but this music is very accessible even for those of us confessed &quot;old bags&quot; who only listen to a small amount of pop music. She's just good! There are tons of great songs with all sorts of neat effects. Every once in a while I felt like a song was going to turn into Funky Town, but maybe that's just to show how much older I am than the new generation of Madonna fans -- I like La Isla Bonita and Express Yourself the best.If you've ever liked Madonna, then don't hesitate to buy this dancy and fun album.

From the title, I had always assumed this was a non-fiction work but I'm happy to report it is in fact an excellent book of short stories. I was so completely charmed by the 12 year old narrator in the first story that I read the whole book in one sitting. How can you not love the &quot;loser&quot; younger sister who tries to hold her sarcastic thoughts in as she watches her older brother and his bizarre Jordan-esque girlfriend. We are lucky as readers to hear her snide remarks in italics like her thoughts on saying goodnight, &quot;I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to go shoot some heroin now.&quot; The first story is full of witticisms and insights into the young Janie who appears in many of the later stories as well.I particularly like the title story (the final one in the collection) in which we watch the narrator try to live by the &quot;rules&quot; of dating from some ridiculous self-help book. Everytime she is about to let her own funny voice come through (which is how her date first was attracted to her), she stifles it in favor of the &quot;proper&quot; remark, and quickly loses her man. It is really quite hilarious. I enjoyed this collection from start to finish, even the somewhat odd creation of Archie, the older man. A very refreshing collection.

I can't believe more people don't know about this incredible book. It's beautifully written and tremendously informative. I agree with the reviewer below who said that it's the best book on 20th century China. And what a movie it would make if done right. Still, I'm taking away from the book itself -- if you think it's tough reading Holocaust literature, try this -- the Japanese and the Chinese committed the most horrible tortures and crimes on each other you can imagine, yet the author dwells on the hope and the love of her family despite the horrors she recounts. One of the most moving books you'll ever read.

At first I was skeptical that the daughter of Al Gore could really write, but now I feel guilty for even thinking that. Yes, this book might fall into the chick lit genre, but it's chick lit done right. In other words, Ms. Gore is FUNNY. Some of the blackberry exchanges (not so much the BIG mistake, but the other ones) are hilarious, as are some of the zany side plots like the Japanese fighting fish that keep on dying on Sammy. The narrator's adventures are many (I wonder if every good looking woman in DC has this fun a social life), but I do like the way the boyfriends are fleshed out, at least the memorable ones like the WP reporter Lawton (my favorite). Aaron was a bit stereotypical, yet a stereotype that does seem to hold water!Overall, I was impressed by the novel. Sure, it had some minor flaws (some of the characters like Sammy's friend needed more of a real role, too many side plots) but nothing that would take away from the overall effort. It held my attention all the way through with many laugh out loud parts (I chuckled at her "prayers to the god of this and that" every time she wants something to go her way). Very entertaining and proves that Ms. Gore does not need her dad's fame to succeed on her own terms. Bravo!

I don't want to level any devasting criticism at this book since I very much liked it, but I did think that Winchester overdoes things at times with his Victorian mystery stuff. I wish I could remember the name of the first book I read about James Murry and the OED because I liked it more. It wasn't written like a novel, but it provided more of the linguistic background to James Murray and his quest to make the world's greatest dictionary. Still, I enjoyed this book for its subject -- how can anyone who loves language not find the story of the making of the OED interesting? Except for my minor criticism about the oversensationalizing, it's a fine read about a fascinating topic. Now that I have my own OED, I'd recommend acquiring one of these too.

I admit that I'm a 70's 80's rock fan and haven't bought many rock albums in the intervening decades. Someone turned me on to Elephant which has become one of my favorite albums and then based on many suggestions here on amazon, I decided to try this one out. It's totally different than Elephant -- much more raw and primal, but I like it. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but Jack really brings back Robert Plant voice for me -- I would have sworn this was an undiscovered Led Zepplin garage tape had I just heard it out of the blue (well, maybe not the drumming, but the guitar and wailing voices). This album has that same effect that great Zepplin albums have on me -- I just want to crack them up and blast them for a while. Elephant is a bit more subtle with songs that vary much more in style. The songs on this one are all in the same vein, but if you like that vein, you'll enjoy the album. I guess I'll have to try the other two albums as well.

Obviously I must not be as big a Nabokov groupie as other Pale Fire enthusiasts, because when I read Pale Fire in a college seminar, most of us spent weeks admiring Nabokov's academic satire and what we then thought was a purposefully horrible poem. Now I feel somewhat shamed because Boyd seems to think the poem itself is great poetry -- I cringe because our class read out loud particularly funny lines and laughed at what a good &quot;bad&quot; poem Nabokov wrote. Maybe Boyd does miss some of the humor, but that is all he misses. I don't think he leaves one line, joke, pun, or obscure reference unexplained. I enjoyed the first few chapters more because they stuck to many of the more obvious discoveries Nabokov intended his readers to make. By the middle, Boyd had my head spinning with some of the leaps of analysis -- I was too confused to agree or disagree. But by the end, his overall surprises and theories come together and make sense. No matter what you make of Boyd's theory, I applaud the book for its emphasis on close reading and for its obvious love of this great writer. Nabokov is one of this century's best and deserves this kind of in-depth reading. In the final chapter, Boyd answers some of the criticisms about his theory (by Michael Wood, for instance, a Princeton prof) and almost ends up sounding like Kinbote for a moment in his defensiveness. This book is a true discovery for a devout reader because it shows how to read better and more closely, how to link (bobo-link) seemingly unrelated bits together. Hats off to a great work of Nabokov scholarship -- Boyd brought in lots of information from Nabokov's other works that proved to be quite important.

I have to admit my fondness for all military tales -- I loved Dress Gray, and almost every book I've ever read about military discipline. This one though is one of my all time favorites in that genre. It's brutal at times, but a major page turner. Great plane or beach reading -- just make sure no one interrupts you until you're done. As an aside, because of the vivid pacing and compelling plot, this is a great book to give to kids (especially boys) who are reluctant readers. All students I've recommended this book to have loved it.

Baaba Maal is a master musician with all his talents on display on this CD. Every song is excellent in terms of instrumentation, vocals and sensitive lyrics. Thanks to the producers who included translations of all the songs so we can follow along. With his soaring voice he inspires as he tells traditional stories and recounts traditional African themes. This is one of his strongest overall CD's. With its acoustic quality I think almost everyone will appreciate the musicality of this recording. Great photos too.

Someday Ingalls will be brought back into print and hailed as one of the most innovative writers of our day. Her End of Tragedy is amazing and Mrs. Caliban a classic for all times. In some ways she reminds me of Jonathan Carroll -- her books and novellas start out normally, but slowly but surely draw you into an odd and offbeat world. If you can find this one in a public library, grab it! It's a quick read.

I just don't get it: in America, can any writer just dash out the most heartrending story, no matter how poorly written and sell millions of copies? After reading this and Timepiece (featuring of course a very sad &quot;death of child&quot; scene), I guess the answer is yes. Okay, it's a cute story and since the author just meant it to be a little inspirational story for his daughters, who can criticize him? But to hail it as a masterpiece is another matter. I won't bother to quote some of the really bad lines, but there are many. Let's just say that by the time you read yet another adverbial exclamation (she said tearily...), there's nothing left for the imagination. If good writers &quot;show, not tell,&quot; this is 180 degrees in the opposite direction. It's spelled out to the last letter. I was waiting for a stage direction: reader -- this is the scene to cry over.I don't want to take away from the fact that this is a nice story and a very short one at that, but I'm not sure why (unless we are so joyless we look anywhere for an uplifting story) Evans is the multimillion dollar author that he is. I'm not bitter -- just a bit shocked at how basic and non-literary his books are.

Granted I went about things the unusual way to get my two non-fiction books published (was lucky enough to find a great agent), but I wanted to see how things were supposed to work. I'm happy to report that the author knows what he's talking about! My agent taught me much of what he writes, but if you don't have an agent (or don't need one), this is the fastest and most painless way to figure out how to avoid the &quot;slush&quot; pile(where most unsolicited manuscripts go). He provides the format for the 5-6 pages of material you need to send (do NOT send the whole book) and explains the most common mistakes that just about anyone would make if they didn't read this kind of book first. Extremely useful, well laid out and easy to follow.

This book is a tremendous help to those of us setting out to find the Messier objects. The biggest problem with finding objects is figuring out what they should like like in a telescope -- sometimes I've got something in the finder or telescope and I'm not certain what it is. O'Meara solves that problem by providing photographs and his terrific drawings, not to mention is verbal paintings which could make a blind person see the objects. He devoted hours to each single object, waxing poetic at times about the merits and downsides to every single object. The first few chapters give some good history and background of Messier and other famous comet hunters. As a final plus, the book is printed on very high quality glossy paper so it's a pleasure to read. As a field guide, it would have been helpful to have it spiral bound, but that's my only suggestion for improvement. The author even includes a helpful appendix of other interesting sky objects that are not Messier objects, all of which are worthwhile telescope targets. A winner!

I was only familiar with Vaughan Williams from his shorter pieces like my favorite, Fantasia on a theme by Tom Tallis -- this is my first listen to his symphonies. So far, I'm enthralled. These two recordings are tremendous -- great music well played. I suppose you could say that Williams' signature style is beautiful renditions of subtlely blended and harmonized music. What most critics leave out is his sense of drama -- while bucolic in parts, these symphonies have sections that can blow you away! Keep in mind he did many film scores as well so these pieces sometimes have a cinematic quality to them. A great CD.

Though I have criticized other books written by Evans, I have to admit that this one was better -- the writing was better, plot, period details and storyline. He still comes up a bit short on characterization and relies on some overly stereotyped scenes and scenarious, but at least this was more palatable.The public is hungry for these feel good books about hope, faith, despair and love. In this genre, I think Evans is probably at the top. I didn't quite make it to the hankie phase, but there are some touching scenes. It's hard to really criticize Evans since his books are so well-intentioned. I found this book sweet in parts, a bit mawkish in others. Overall, a sweet read.

My experience with Japanese writers has been limited to Ishiguro (who is practially English after living over 25 years in England) and Murakami, so I was a bit taken aback by the sheer darkness and depravity of Mishima. Yet, his writing is compelling and his tale gripping. You are supposed to find the main character repulsive -- it's pretty clear that he finds himself repulsive at times as well. Clearly Mishima is a force in Japanese fiction and a writer to be reckoned with. This book is not a fun read, but in the scope of Japanese works, it's an important read.

I'm hard pressed to think of a book I enjoyed more in the last 20 years. Every time I re-read it, I keep wishing that Stevens will follow his emotions rather than trying to follow his station as butler. Anthony Hopkins does a terrific job in the movie showing the character's extreme restraint and inability to acknowledge his love. Not only is this a great love story, it's a great historical novel, psychology study and beautifully written to boot. Ishiguro writes with such nuance and understatement and with such an eye for detail that I think any reader will be captivated. This is one of the most breathtaking books Ishiguro ever wrote and one of the best contemporary books around.

I met Heaney 10 years ago at Dartmouth College where I was fortunate enough to hear him read his poetry -- I was captivated then and I still am now by his command of English. I almost enjoyed his introduction more than the actual translation for its erudition, rich vocabulary and contextual explanations. It's been a long time since I've seen the words &quot;revenant,&quot; &quot;chthontic&quot; and &quot;oneiric&quot; bandied around with alacrity. I'm not an Old English scholar either, but I still found the facing translation useful. I agree with the reviewer below who said it would be helpful to have glosses and textual notes. Even better in this regard is the Robert Pinsky facing page translation of Dante's Inferno. Anyway, this translation makes Beowolf fun and accessible -- sure, it's worth reading the &quot;classic&quot; translations as well, but Seaney should be congratulated for bringing a book many were forced to read, to a state where the book can be savored. Like Branaugh's revival of Shakespeare, who can lament the return of one of the most pivotal works in English. Read it!

I laughed out loud in many instances as I relived some of the horrible and petty campus politics played out at many universities. Hart does a great job showing how poor administrators can actually take away from the education of students, particularly minority students like the ESL students he writes about so convincingly. Using his own experience, he captures the voice and thoughts of the insecurities of recent Englsih speakers who struggle with intro English courses. I didn't love the epistolary form of the novel nor the lack of depth of the two main characters, but I did enjoy the novel quite a bit overall for its sensitive portrayal of a student teacher relationship and a caring teacher who suffers setbacks thanks to the neanderthal politics of the system. A strong first novel.

After reading the criticisms detailed above in the official review, I have to say that I recognize some of those flaws (especially the repititions), but I don't think they take away from the fun quality of this book. At times, I felt kind of a Dave Barry meets Robert Parker quality of writing. Here's an example regarding correct pairings of reds/whites with food: &quot;If someone else is buying Chateau Petrus or Chateau d'Yquem, by all means drink as much of it as you can, no matter what hell you're eating. Give the food to the dog.&quot;For a good overview of just about every major grape and region, this book may be more helpful to a beginner than a more detailed Parker book which might give more than you need to know. I appreciate McInenery's taste for good wine and his lighthearted columns on his experiences. Every once in a while I'd have a jealousy attack (not all of us can quaff a Petrus or Yquem on a weekly basis), but at least I can afford to read about it. This is a great introduction to wine tasting with none of the technical stuff that should get in the way. I'll conclude with another one of my favorites &quot;rants,&quot; this one on Robert Parker, &quot;The self-proclaimed American Wine Advocate, who at the start of his career couldn't even speak the language, was recently awarded the Legion d'Honneur for telling the Frogs that a lot of their venerable Bordeaux and Burgundy isn't as great as it should be and some of it positively sucks.&quot; Nice to keep a sense of humor while discussing these wine topics.

I'm not going to be quite as harsh as many others who trashed this book. I loved Black Ice, so I started this book with a much more positive attitude. One of its problems is that it does't know if it's a tragedy, a comedy, or a statement of the human condition. The opening chapter aims at humor at the wedding, but then there are wrenching scenes like Nikki's abortion and the affair between Tam and Hiram. The book needed much better editing, a livlier story line and better writing. Though the characters are interesting, the writing is flat and ponderous and it really does drag on. I read for a few hours and was dismayed to see that I was only on page 70. I barely made it to the end, and only because I don't like to leave any book unfinished. I think publishers should be more careful when preparing second books. Just because Black Ice was good doesn't mean this one should have made it without chopping. Terry McMillian does this kind of writing about a hundred times better. This book made me want to reread Waiting to Exhale. Cary could take a lesson from McMillian's sense of humor and stronger writing. That being said, there's still hope for Cary if she tightens up the plot, provides clear clues to the narrator and finds a good editor. I'm not writing her off yet.

Sure, this is a fantastic collection, but after hearing some of my favorite songs (No te conozco, hasta ayer) minus the ENDING, I wanted to do personal harm to whatever editor or producer decided to cut off the final 20-30 seconds of his big hits? Is the record company really try to cram those extra seconds of music onto one disc? I'd much rather have paid for two CD's, or have given up a few of the early songs on this CD which are not as strong as the second half just to have the COMPLETE versions! For those of you who know Marc Anthony's songs, sometimes the final 30 seconds are the most heartfelt -- I think it's Hasta Ayer (I can't tell because this CD doesn't have any part of the ending at all) which cuts of the great lament, &quot;...y yo te queria tanto mujer..&quot; It's not even part of the song! Okay, so I'm peeved about this. It's not like his songs are 15 minutes each and need editing -- come on! I think it was a ploy to get listeners hooked and then force them to buy all his early albums for the very same songs they should have here. And while I'm on a this small gripe session, it's not nearly as well recorded as BVSC which are much more audiophile.Okay, other than that and some of the earlier songs which are a bit bland, the rest of this CD is excellent. I hope no one thinks I'm taking away from Anthony himself -- he is excellent. I just hate when record companies insult devoted fans like this by cutting off his best songs early.

Having studied Latin (and a little bit of Greek, not nearly enough), I totally agree with his major argument that both Latin and Greek are worth studying for their own sake. This elegantly written and well-argued book is a first rate defense of the classics even though it "stands on the shoulders of giants." The intelletual history of humanism and classicism through the ages is worth the price alone, not to mention the terrific quotes he finds from avid classicists like Nock and CS Lewis (whose essay The Parthanon and the Optative was one of the highlights of the cited works). Although he could have been even more damning, I laughed out loud at how silly he makes some of our "modern" educational ideas look (as in "responding" to works we cannot possibly understand) -- more emphasis on the hard work and less on the "feel good" part of academia and our students would be a lot more capable. The central fact of the book is that even those who don't remember a word of Greek and Latin manage to keep and foster a lifelong appreciation for learning and an ability to understand and digest complex texts. This is one of the most cogent arguments for the classics that I've come across and should be mandatory reading for educational reformers who seem bent on dumbing down an already weak curriculum.

I'm far from being an expert in North African music, but 4-5 songs on this CD are truly excellent. I've listened to the CD about 15 times and still haven't tired of it. So far all the Putamayo collections I have are excellent. I even like the cover art and liner notes. It's nice to see that they took the time to write out explanations of all the songs and a bit of background about the artists. These discs are good learning tools to get enough information about these artists to appreciate music from various different cultures.

AFter glancing at the lush cover and exotic plot, I couldn't wait to start this book. Though it had some strong qualities (dreamy writing, exotic scenery ranging from France to Egypt to Istanbul), overall, I found it disappointing. Not to nitpick, but the major plot device (dreaming someone else while at the same time they are dreaming you) is stolen directly from Jorge Luis Borges, the great Argentinian writer. To make matters worse, later in the novella a character looks for a book in the library that contains everything, and that too is directly copied from Borges! So much for originality. There is very little character development, so we never feel that we get to know Casimir or feel for him. The &quot;true love&quot; never seems fully rendered. All in all, most of the charm of this book lies on the surface (setting, plot) but once you dig a little, much of the magic fades away.

Sure some of these lectures could have been red-penciled as one reviewer below suggests, but that misses the point that some randomness and uncertainty are inherent properties of our universe. I love listening to Feynman think outloud and range across other fields besides physics. He points out right in the opening chapters that it's a shame that knowledge becomes so specialized that one feels unqualified to comment without being an &quot;expert.&quot; That's why I enjoy reading F's musings so much -- he clearly is NOT an expert in religion, philosophy, etc..., but he makes so much sense and brings such wonder into the equation that you can't help admire and respect his opinions. These lectures make you think and appreciate the scientist's quest for how things work. Plus, Feynman puts his finger on the real dilemma which isn't how to censor our discoveries (like nuclear reactions) but how to put them to good use without hurting people. If more scientists held this humanitarian view, we'd be much better off. One of these days I'm going to try to tackle his physics lectures -- these are geared towards the general reader.

Ms. Straus is a terrific writer who continues to break new ground in her most recent book on no-talk therapy. Even if you don't have a child who falls into the non-verbal category, I think almost anyone who interacts with children would benefit from reading these case studies and analysis. Teachers for example would learn a great deal about non-verbal cues and quiet children by studying Ms. Straus' observations. Reading this book made me think back to many very quiet students I've taught and realize new dimensions to them. This is the most well-written clinically focused book I've read. Straus engages the reader and presents her information clearly with a lively style. Highly recommended for anyone in the field, and for others outside of it who interact with children.

I think the above reviewer says it best when she points out that judging Evans by the standard of books that make you feel good, this is a good book. Judging him next to Hemingway, well that's another story. Let's start out with the positives: the plot is nice, the story is interesting and the book itself looks gorgeous. I have to admit that what I admire most about Evans isn't his ability to crank out an endless number of similar novels on inspirational themes, it's the fact that Simon and Schuster makes these books so inviting. The font is beautiful, the covers are attractive, the use of two color print draws you in and the jagged pages make the book even more attractive (I'm sure that has a name, but I don't know what they call those uneven-edged pages). I thought the Looking Glass was much better written than this one which was more straightforward.Evans is a solid writer of mass market mush, but you'll be none the worse for reading it. His books are written in such earnest that it makes you feel bad for trying to criticize or hold him up to more literary authors. A solid read.

Although I'm hardly an expert photographer, I feel like one now with this camera. I love just about everything about it. First of all, it looks like a real camera, not one of those pieces of junk that pass for cameras these days. It takes incredible pictures right out of the box. I have the option set for the camera to ask me everytime I take a picture whether I want to keep it or not. That way, I can quickly zap any bad pictures. The LCD monitor is easy to see so you have instant feedback as to whether or not you want to retake the picture. The manual was very well written -- I spent a good deal of time reading it. Even thought the camera does many things, the menu function is very intuitive. After a day or so, I was able to do pretty much anything, even use shutter priorty mode or aperature priority mode. Although many software programs have color options, I love the fact that you can shoot in black and white, color or sepia tones. Also, this camera has both a digital and an optical zoom -- beware of false claims by other cameras. I did a great deal of research before buying this camera and I'm happy to say after a month of using it, I have not been disappointed at all. Some suggestiosn for accessories: buy a card reader! You don't want to drain the battery by using the USB cable right from the camera. They only cost around $35. You'll want at least a 64 MB card! The one it comes with is too small (for the price of this camera, I think Olympus should throw it in). The battery it comes with was dead on arrival and since it is not recharchable, forget it. Buy AA rechargable batteries (one charger, two sets of batteries) and switch them often. The batteries lose charge fast when you use the monitor feature, so beware and carry spare batteries when you travel! A great camera.

Okay, I admit that I'm one of the hardy few who has read EVERY Dave Barry book. Even his weaker books are funny. This happens to be one of the classics. I read it straight through while sitting at a local bookstore. Although almost every page had something that made me laugh; by far the funniest section was his re-writing of our Constitution complete with fake amendments (number 8 was intentionally left blank). This is Barry at his comic best. He also has some funny bits on the Clintons (referring to the boring White House tour he points out tha that you only see the furniture -- oh, what furniture since Hillary and Bill took everything with them). This pseudo history and hilarious send up of Washington is a winner from start to finish. And Dave Barry is not making some of this up. And I'm not his fan just because I happened to have attended the very same middle school Barry did in Armonk, New York.

Having just finished this novel, I'm having trouble pinpointing my thoughts. I still find The Remains of the Day one of the more perfect novels of our generation. Oddly, the &quot;love&quot; story between the narrator and Sarah could come straight out of Remains: Christopher stifles so many urges for her that we cannot help but think of the butler in Remains. As Christopher reads her final letter, we could practically imagine ourselves in the pages of Remains in a similar scene. Add to this side plot the detective element as Christopher turns his detective skills to the mystery of his parents' disappearance and you have several threads to follow in this complex novel. The novel seems to have two distinct parts. The first half or so is the leisurely recounting of the narrator's childhood and his parents' disappearance. The second half turns into a fast paced chase through war torn Shanghai as the quest winds down.As a detective story, we learn from the beginning to question Christopher's trustworthiness as a narrator. For example, he remembers himself as a &quot;normal&quot; student, and is somewhat taken aback when he meets an old friend who describes him as an oddball. There are at least twenty instances when the narrator questions his own ability to remember correctly. Like Remains, we take in the whole book through this narrator's eyes, so we have to learn to see through this filter.There are a few coincidences that are hard to believe towards the novel's end. I think that these take away from the force of the novel as a whole. In short, this novel has beautifully written prose, but as a whole, I found it slightly disappointing even as a big fan of Ishiguro's. Still, I think Ighiguro fans should read it -- perhaps I'm being picky -- Ishiguro is one of my all time favorite writers and this is a terrific book in parts. It just seemed a bit disjointed by the end. Give it a try and then read his other four books.

I guarantee you will be fatigued after reading this gripping account of a 119 day drift in the roaring 40's off the coast of New Zealand. Due to some freaky currents, the four men aboard actually ended up making a circle to the north and then back to the west towards New Zealand. While on board, they projected that they'd be heading toward South America and it is scary to note there just ain't anything between the two places. This is a very well done account of the day to day life and how little by little the four men come together at least enough to learn how to subsist off the sea. They were very lucky in that they had lots of food on board to start because it took them a while to learn how to catch fish. You'll never look at fish guts the same way -- they used EVERY part of the fish. The author does a good job showing the shifting friendships and loyalties -- not surprising considering the small space they shared for 4 months. This is more than the typical survival book in that the author follows up with one of the survivor's fight with cancer almost immediately when he returned. Thus, the end of the book is bittersweet with one of the men dying after he made many key personal realizations about himself and his life. An excellent adventure read with some insights into friendship as well.

I hadn't read the whole series since I was in 8th grade, but just this past summer I started with the Hobbit and read the Lord of the Rings and then the Simillarion -- what a story! I literarlly could not put the books down and gave up the better part of 3-4 days reading, totally immersed in the forests and land of Frodo, Gollum, Bilbo, etc.... Tolkien's genius is that he really created a whole world complete with languages, customs, social divisions, along with memorable characters -- heck, even Led Zepplin sings of &quot;Golum and the evil one.&quot; Anyone who loves these books should also check out another fantasy type writer, Jonathan Carroll. Lest anyone not be impressed by what Tolkein did in these books, his linguistic studies and achievements are even more noteworthy. These books are great to read aloud to your kids and get them hooked on reading. Long live Gandolf!

Yes, it is a parody of the What to expect when you're expecting real book on pregnancy written for the father. Now that you know that, it is amusing in places with some downright funny parts, but overall I wish it had been funnier. Maybe it tries to give real advice every once in a while instead of sticking to just humor which might confuse some readers (judging from the reviews that didn't notice it was funny?). I feel the same way about this book I feel about episodes of Monty Python and the Flying Circus -- some great skits with lots of mediocre bits thrown in. It was a clever idea that I feel could have reached even higher comic levels, but as a quick funny read for fathers, it might just hit the spot.

Just because it's by some guy named Homer and it's &quot;classic&quot; doesn't mean it's unreadable. Quite to the contrary, the Odyssey is one of the most readable ancient works around because so many of the stories (the Cyclops, Scylla and Charbydis, Circe, Penelope) have become part of the very fabric of our Western culture. Even Eric Clapton sings of Homer in &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; in the old song by Cream! There's an allusion for you. Surprisingly, most of my honors 9th grade students adored the Odyssey and found it easy going. The Iliad is harder because it's more of a war book, while the Odyssey is much more of an adventure poem. You won't find the same technical level of poetry in the Odyssey (few of the those great epic similies) as you do in the Iliad, but it is the much more accessible work of the two. Great background reading for both kids and adults is the D'Aulair's Greek Mythology which is written for kids, but helpful for adults as well. I do like Fitzgerald's translation, but I&quot;m still partial to the Lattimore for its proximity to the Greek. Most readers will find Fitzgerald easier, but once you've enjoyed it, give the Lattimore a try -- it's the closest you can come to hearing the poem in Greek.

In turns, this account of his incredibly strenuous year is funny, heartbreaking, introspective and irreverent. I'm surprised how modest the author is about his ability to even perform some of the workouts -- a 3 hour and 55 minute run or ski! I'm an exercise fanatic myself, but I don't see any 4 hour workouts on my horizon. The chapters on the origin and development of cross country skiing are fascinating -- I used to hear about Koch and Caldwell when I taught at the Putney school. Our Olympic program hasn't really done much to produce skiiers since that time. You'll also gain a tremendous respect for the Norwegians, Swedes and Finns whose reverence for this grueling sport makes them the finest in the world. This book went well beyond just sports -- although his father's illness was introduced abruptly, it does serve as an anchor for much of hte second half of the book. His dignity to the end made it inspiring rather than depressing. My only small criticism is that since the book is so personal I would have liked to hear more from his wife and daughter's reactions to his training. He alludes to them, but it sounds like they lived on another planet for that year which I'm sure was not the case! Very rewarding and inspiring read, well written.

This book is for anyone who likes animals and enjoys reading musings on what dogs/cats/birds... are thinking at any given moment. Thanks to her incredible descriptions and anecdotal tales, you may find yourself starting to think like a dog -- after reading about the white dog, Sundog, I wished I could have met him. She has a great eye for detail and has the ability to make anyone appreciate the complex canine world. I thought her dog fascist musings were funny, but I guess not everyone did. She is opinionated, but based on the inordinately high number of pets she has had over the years, I think she's earned that right. And if you were ever thinking of getting a parrot, read the parrot chapter!The first 3/4 of the book was more absorbing in some ways than the final 1/4 which got into ESP and some other funky areas. I think she probably hit on the main point that probably dogs (and even humans) pick up different clues that account for the supposed coincidences. A very enjoyable book that will help you appreciate our canine friends.

Lundy writes one of the most literary and most spellbinding adventure accounts of all the action books out there. I'm a big fan of almost all these books, but this one will rivet you like no other. Lundy takes the time to interview all the sailors to the point that we feel that we know them personally. He also analyzes the kind of personal profile that would lead someone to sled down a 7 story wave at 30 knots in a 60 foot boat. For those who find oceans and currents interesting, Lundy gives quite a lot of descriptions of the roaring 40's, screaming 60's, the types of waves and currents at those latitudes, the various pressure systems, and how weather whips around the globe with no land to stop it. The Southern Ocean is in a category by itself and it seems almost crazy to try to tame it solo with sailboats, no matter how modern. Lundy does use a good deal of technical jargon, but I found it easy enough to follow as a non-sailor since he does explain all the special vocabulary.Rather than follow the gimicky technique of some adventure books that leave you hanging at every minute, he delves into some more philosophical areas, history and background and provides a meatier book than most. Anyone who likes sailing, insane risks, wild action, and stories of courage and adventure will love this book. It was one of my favorites overall, even stacked against Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. I can't get the image out of my mind of the sailor that came back and could not let go of his small son's head -- which made altogether more poignant the case of the sailor who died, leaving behind his 8 year old girl and wife.

This is not an easy read, but it is an important one. It took me almost a week to get through it, but LeBlanc's investigative work and dedication over a 10 year period is inspiring. Yes, it's depressing to see that these kids don't use birth control and don't seem to learn from past poor examples, but the question we need to focus on is WHY? Why have other poor immigrant groups succeeded while these Latina/black inhabitants of the Bronx have not?I disagree with the reviewer who said these characters are not sympathetic -- they make big mistakes, but their humanity shines through and LeBlanc does an incredible job of making us all see how frustrating welfare, waiting in line, lack of doctor's appointments etc... can be to those who live in poverty. A powerful book.

I've been avidly progressing through the entire astronomy library since I acquired a telescope several months ago. After reading all the more technical books, it was nice to get to this lyrical mediation on the heavens. I'm not expert enough to affirm the other reviewer's assertion that there are many mistakes -- I didn't notice any, but I'm hardly a professional astronomer. This book is beautiful to gaze upon-- the cover is gorgeous, the pages thick and the photos and illustrations lush. After spending months looking at the stars and reading "how to" astronomy books, it was a nice change of pace to find this little gem that covers many different aspects of astromony from the planets to the galaxies. I didn't realize when I read Raymo's terrific novel The Dork of Cork that he was an astronomer, although I should have guessed since the main character is a dwarf who spends lots of time stargazing. If you haven't read his novel, I highly recommend that too. Meanwhile, if you're looking for a slighly different astronomy book with a lovely feel and look, pick this one up and enjoy it.

While this book was enjoyable in parts, I just don't see what sets this book apart from other travelogues. I'm glad the author enjoys living and entertaining in Tuscany (who wouldn't) and tending to her garden, but the bottom line is that I just didn't find these vignettes all that interesting. Maybe it's because I'm not a gardener - I tended to identify more with the eating and cooking aspects of the book which were at least lively and interesting. If you're visiting Italy or just like armchair travel you may enjoy perusing this book. It's passable, just not the most exciting book I've ever read. I think most generic travel guides (like the Rough Guide) are more interesting reads.Plus, even though she claims to be the sensitive American living in Italy, she has so many silly mafia stereotypes and &quot;canned&quot; portraits of Italians that I almost didn't recognize Italy from the actual weeks I've spent travelling through the country. Mediocre by any standard.

This book is The Odyssey, a bit of magic realism, an allegory, The Canterbury Tales, and a modern day pilgrammage all in one. This pilgrammage actually traces more or less backwards some of the route of the actual trek to Santiago de Compostela. As you have read from other's summaries, this tale, set against the backdrop of Spain's joining the ECC, starts with a literal split: Spain and Portugal break off from France. This of course leaves several humorous possibilities and ironies which Saramago is quick to exploit. After years of Portugal being more or less Spain's tail, it gains new prominence as the rotation of the peninsula changes. Not only is the peninsula's float halted before the impending collision with the Azores, the whole peninsula rotatates to the right so that the Algarve ends up pointing north. During all this, we follow a group of travelers, all of whom seemed to have a hand in the mischief.Although I liked Blindness better overall, this book does reflect many of the same themes. One important message seems to be that humans get used to whatever horrible conditions they are forced to live with. In Blindness of course, everyone is forced to deal with the abhorent conditions following the sudden attack of blindness on the whole populace. Here, people are forced to deal with world catastrophe, annihilation (the threat of), looting, stealing, and a total breakdown in the system. Saramago loves to show us how close our civilized society is to breakdown with just minor changes to our living conditions.There were parts that I thought dragged a bit in the narrative (although his writing his so great that you may not mind and I feel guilty even pointing it out), but things picked up during the final pilgrammage to the sea. At this point, the journey completed, the peninsula stops its northward drift.Lots of good satire, allegory, and irreverence here. A first time reader may want to start with Blindness before undertaking this book.

I don't mean to insult Siegel -- I liked his academic parady and did find parts of the book to be very funny. It's just that once you've read Nabokov's masterpiece, Pale Fire, you see how much better Nabokov was at that kind of parody. It almost seems that Siegel copies Nabokov a bit too closely. Parts of this book were just poorly done, but it had enough to make it worth reading if you enjoy academic spoofs. If you liked this book at all, you must read Pale Fire.

I knew next to nothing about modern India, so I learned a lot from these breezy essays. Sure they wonder all over the place -- chapters jump from political topics to the draught to Indian yuppies, but for the casual reader, the essays are very entertaining and informatative. The effect is that of reading several short travelogues about India all in a row. Mehta writes well and makes some sharp observations about India's political development. I wanted to see more description of the various parts of India (the desert like areas versus the huge cities and vast fertile plains) because it is a land of such great contrasts. Most of the essays left me wanting to know more. I enjoyed the personal anecdotes from the author's childhood. Not a history book, but a good and easy to read overview for the Indian novice.

I can't say enough about this terrific but little known book. When you read a brief summary of the plot, it almost sounds like a spoof -- come on! An irish dwarf astronomer? But, Raymo is really a great writer and produces an absorbing and magical book that is about everything! It's philosphical, down to earth, magical, all while recounting a fascinating tale. Really it's quite hard to describe Raymo's achievement here, but it is an achievement. Take all the reviewer's word for it and read it yourself. I happen to love astronomy, so I hold it dear to my heart in my list of favorites.

Maybe it's just because I have over 30 CDs of Cuban music, but this is not my favorite. Compay is great and I like his voice, but I prefer son/son montuno and the styles of these songs don't appeal to me as much as those of other CDs like &quot;El son es el mas sublime.&quot; Certainly worth listening to, but not as stunningly brilliant as the others in the collection.

Anyone who loves the magic of the Harry Potter books will be equally wowed by this brilliant and magical book. It made me wish I were a child again. It's much easier to read than Sophie's world and ultimately I find it a more satisfying book. It's one of my all time favorites -- it will carry you off to a magical world of cards and tricks that will make you wish it would never end. I want to meet the author!

I've enjoyed several of Mayle's other books, but this one is an amiable clunker. The mystery plot is buried under the guise of globetrotting and eating good food. The book would have read much better without the dumb chase scenes (the &quot;hit man&quot; following our narrator) and with more meals. After all, it's mood, ambience and food that Mayle specializes in, not characterization and plot, both of which are sorely lacking.This book is so mediocre that it's not even a good beach read. You won't care much what happens in this &quot;art&quot; mystery because the plot is so thrown together. One gets the feeling his editor said, &quot;Okay, we need a book in a week.&quot; I won't hold it against Mayle since his other books are much more charming, but this one is almost totally devoid of this usual charm.

I discovered this book through a rave review from The Common Reader which also signalled that it was back in print finally. As others have recounted, the book tells the incredible tale of the prisoners' escape from Siberia (and the harrowing journey to get there) as they cover 30 miles a day on their way to India. It's amazing the level of detail the author is able to recall and the hospitality of the Mongols and Tibetans he met along the journey. Reduced to starvation and exhaustion (especially after the harrowing crossing of the Gobi Desert), they exist meal to meal looking for food and water. Even in this state, their humanity shines through as they grieve for the ones who died on the journey (the story of Kristina is one of the most touching you'll ever read) and push each other as they climb the Himilayan peaks in shabby clothing and moccasins. An incredible tale of survival and determination, well written and well recalled. Inspiring and life changing.

I want to start out by saying that I agree with all the criticism by my fellow reviewers regarding his selection of leftist intellectuals -- I'm sure you could write about just about any intellectual and unearth some unflattering details about their personal lives. Though I found the writing biased, to be fair to Johnson he also can be very illuminating at times -- even when he disagrees, he does a strong job of summarizing and encapsulating the views of many well known thinkers (everyone from Rousseau to Brecht to Russel). As I was reading some of the more salacious material, I find myself wondering, do I really need to know this? That one had chronic bad breath, another never based, more than one had problems with their penises -- parts of these articles could be printed in Cosmo! Though there's no doubt they were entertaining descriptions, I'm not sure it's fair to condemn them for their all too human foibles and dalliances. Many would fall under such close inspection. One picky criticism -- no need to use the world &quot;adamantine&quot; in so many descriptions -- I started to think he was picking intellectuals based on the ability to fit this adjective in.I guess I've been a bit harsh. I did learn a great deal about the personal lives and the major ideas of these intellectuals. I wish Johnson hadn't been quite so savage in dissecting their personal lives. And the writing is very good.

I loved Waiting to Exhale -- this book is not as &quot;deep&quot; psychologically speaking, but it's a fun romp in Jamaica. No one gets inside the upper middle class black mind like MacMillan. She's not going for Shakespeare here, so give her a break -- this is a fun book to be enjoyed and savored. I think more readers should be happy that for once we have positive and strong black literary characters who are financial successes. I hope both black and white children will learn something from these books alone the lines of there are plenty of successful black women -- not all black people play basketball or deal drugs! The sexual plot is throughly enjoyable -- I think MacMillan must have had a ball writing this one. For an enjoyable read, pick it up!

Sir Richard Burton was a true legend -- he spoke more than 25 languages, travelled to all sorts of remote places, and had a fascinating life. If you enjoy armchair travel books, this one if for you. Rice travelled extensively in the 10 years it took him to research Burton's life. Burton has many &quot;firsts&quot; to his name: the first European to look for the source of the Nile, the first to discover Lake Tanganyika, the first to disguise himself and visit Medina and Mecca, and the list goes on. If not for Burton, we would not have the Kama Sutra nor the tales from Arabian Nights. You can just see Burton in his tent in Africa translating and keeping diary notes. This is one of the most interesting biographies I have ever read. A true adventurer.

I'm on a quest now to acquire all of Carroll's books since they tend to go out of print quickly, at least in the United States (he lives in Vienna and his books are big sellers in Europe). I just got a copy of Black Cocktail which I had never read and was again blown away by his imagination and story-telling ability. He gets this idea from Plato -- that all humans originally were joined to another being and spend the rest of their lives looking for their other half (also Plato's explanation for sexual preference as those that started as two men obviously look for the male half). Only Carroll makes it the perfect 5 (i.e. everyone used to be 5 people connected) and has his usual interesting and quirky characters trying to reunite. This is only a 75 page novella, but it has all the classic Carroll elements. Read it!

It's not often you read an 800 page book and literally can't put it down. From page one, this book was tremendously absorbing with its rapier like dissection of high Atlanta society, its almost cartoonish characters and a slew of fascinating side plots. I loved Bonfire, but this book succeeds in being more ambitious, more encompassing and more satisfying. I have some small gripes with the ending, but overall Wolfe is so good at his broad-brush painting that I can't really critize. Someone mentioned Balzac -- I think the comparison is abt in that Wolfe, like Balzac, fills us in by providing an almost minute-by-minute account of life. Perhaps I neglected to mention how damned funny this book is too -- if Wolfe doesn't make you laugh, you have to be missing a few synapses upstairs. You may find yourself speaking in a southern drawl. The prison scenes were absolutely riveting -- I have to say they might have constituted my favorite scenes in the novel.If you've ever enjoyed Balzac's writings (by coincidence, I happened to have read a few earlier this year), you'll enjoy Wolfe's detailed portrait of politics in our time.

I've read probably 20 survival type books this past year of which this is one of the very best. Alexander skillfully weaves together diaries, interviews and the great Hurley photographs into an incredible narrative of the Shackleton voyage. The descriptions become more and more incredible, increasing exponentially along with the level of suffering and deprivation. The most incredible part of the voyage is the last stretch: 800 miles over open ocean trying to hit the tiny St. Georgia whaling station in hurricane like conditions. The reader can feel the wet, the cold and the hunger with every turn of the page (perhaps even smell the blubber boiling over the fire).Of course we also learn a lot about leadership -- to me the most moving part of the story was Shackleton's agony over the delayed rescue of the group left behind on Elephant Island. His companions noted that he aged more during these few months than during the rest of the grueling expedition. This book, along with its wonderful photographs is a must read for adventure fans.

I guess you could pick apart the writing and say that Belfer is not the most literary genius in the history of literature, but I have to confess that I could not put this book down. The plot was engrossing from start to finish -- I had to stay up till 2am to finish it which says something for her writing level. It's a combination of Jack Finney's Time and Again (in terms of the quality to recreate a city, in this case Buffalo, in the early 20th century) and Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day (a repressed narrator who manages to rationalize any hints of emotion).Ms. Barret, the protagonist, narrator, and headmistress of the Macauley School in Buffalo (based on the Buffalo Seminary School for girls) leads us through the maze of her charges at school, her goddaughter, a murder mystery, the invention and propagation of electricity, etc... all against the backdrop of the falls (Niagra Falls, of course). We see everything through her eyes: the conventions of the day, the politics, the intrigue, the mystery. I didn't solve the central mysteries, but that's not to say other more mystery oriented readers might not. The point is that this novel is well paced, well rendered and extremely readable. Absorbing actually would be a better way to describe it. The characters are based in many cases on real historical characters. Once you read this book, I guarantee you'll never look at Grover Cleveland the same way.It's hard to believe that this is the author's first novel. She weaves a well-researched and authentic tale that will keep you up late into the evening trying to tie together all the loose ends.

I picked up this book because I just started doing a Tae Bo like workout at my gym. Though I have been a compulsive exerciser for years (biking, running, blading and lifting), this workout has reached all kinds of muscles and skills that I hadn't used before. The first time I did a kick boxing workout, I did an 1 1/2 class -- it was the best workout I'd had in years. There's something very satisfying and empowering about the punching and picking. For women especially, I think it's a great workout for the mind and body. This book is very helpful because it outlines how to do every move with the proper form. Even though I had been doing the movements, I didn't have the time to study how to do them better. Now I feel much more confident. Plus, I enjoyed the story of Billy himself -- no self pity here: he was one of fifteen kids, but felt very loved and appreciated in his own family. This man is an inspiration on many fronts. As a fitness book, this is very high quality. He also has a healthy attitude about eating and dieting - refreshing for an exercise book. The sections on warm up and stretching are also very well done.

There's something comforting about reading these rants instead of watching them. I found that by reading them, I was able to hear and absorb all of the razor sharp barbs. The problem is that Miller is so erudite and so damned funny that when you listen to him, you find yourself just getting what he said two lines ago as he goes on and on in his rant. Reading them will give you a better appreciation of his rapier wit. I agree that this selection is a bit &quot;sweeter&quot; than some of his early and more bitter rants. But he still calls a... a ... and skewers many aspects of our society, all of which deserve skewering. You may not always agree with him, but most of us can find the humor and perspective refreshing. As for his amazing use of simile, Virgil and Homer beware -- rarely have I seen simile put to such good use.As others have mentioned, these are &quot;bite-sized&quot; rants, so this is a good book to pick up and put down. It was a bit much reading it all in one sitting as I did -- I'd recommend spreading it out over a week or so. Very sharp!

I confess to only having seen one or two episodes of his show. I didn't see enough to know whether he was a conservative or liberal and just happened to pick up this book while at my local Borders. I have to say, he had me in stitches with his expose of ridiculous goings on in our government, schools and cities. Though I don't always agree with him (although I did lots of the time), I always respected his arguments. Plus, he's really funny. How can you not laugh while he lambasts Leonard DiCaprio and adds, &quot;I found myself rooting for the iceberg.&quot; In one of the closing chapters after he's finished going over all the &quot;bad&quot; people, he lists all the people he actually likes. I immediately sided with him when he proclaimed Dave Barry the funniest writer in America. Now I'm a diehard OReilly fan. Unlike many books in this vein, he doesn't come off as such an egomanical lunatic. He includes lots of good chapters that describe his Catholic school upbringing and his dating escapades.He makes so many great points and is so &quot;un&quot; politically correct, that I'd recommend this book to almost anyone. In the worst case scenario, you'd just agree to disagree, but he'll make you sweat to defend your position. I'm a new fan (and I'm not a conservative).

I think some readers are being a little harsh in their criticisms. Sure, Bryson is pretty aware of the fact that he's not the buff, athletic hiker that many are who attempt the trail -- he's just an average Joe sixpack who wants to have a little adventure. What makes the book memorable though are the descriptions and Bryson's humor. I'm still laughing about the scene at the beginning in the Dartmouth Co-op (notorious for its top prices and fancy equipment)where he is overwhelmed at what he does not know about camping equipment. I can't imagine who wouldn't laugh out loud at many of the hilarious mishaps and bizarre characters found within. I find Bryson very entertaining. For someone who's hiked parts of the trail, I think it's even more interesting, but not a prerequisite.

No doubt that smart kids tend to find this game a whole lot more exciting than slower kids. I only say this because kids these days are becoming more impatient and used to video games -- this game is much more cerebral -- setting up the board is just as important as actually playing the game. For those with the patience, there is a ton of strategy in setting up the pieces (which rank 1-9 with the 8's being mine diffusers, plus a Spy and some bombs) and then lots of strategy as you go to war. Although you might think this is a boy's game, I (as a female) always found it a great game as did all my girl friends. Once you learn the rules, they stay with you forever. I just recently played it after not having seen it for 20 years, and it was just as much fun. This is definitely a game for sharp kids who like plotting strategies. As a bonus, it definitely will help your kid's concentration skills.

I think even young children will enjoy this game. My daughter was under 4 when we started, but she loves the counting aspect of the game. It's great for number recognition skills because you make them say the number on the die outloud as they &quot;roll.&quot; The only rule I don't like is that you need a &quot;6&quot; to start. Often that makes the beginning a bit slow if no one gets a 6. Once things get going, it's a lot of fun and easy to play. The thing in the middle is harder to push than it looks, so for very young children, they may not be strong enough to push it. 3-4 year olds should have no problem though and it makes a satisfying pop. A fun and easy game -- avoid if your child still puts small plastic pieces in his mouth though.

I have said lots about Bloom in reviews of his other books. Suffice it to say that he was a literary genius who took advantage of his odd sleeping patterns and low need for sleep to read scores of books a week for his whole life. Therefore, I appreciate Bloom for his encylopedic knowledge of literature. And don't think he hasn't read contemporary multi-cultural works -- it's just that he never loses his perspective because he can hold the classics in his hands along with new works and compare them in an unbiased way. Like his book on Shakespeare, this book's main virtue is that it will inspire both the inexperienced reader and the long time reader to pick up many of these masterpieces and read them (or reread them). For that alone, Bloom deserves praise. You may not always agree with him, but you cannot help but be in awe of his knowledge base which extends from the biblical to the modern with few gaps. I found the reading list helpful as well. Of course he leaves out many great authors, but he's not trying to be all inclusive and that shouldn't stop you from seeking out other great works of literature. This is a great introduction to many great works that deserve to be read by any thinking person.

I am relatively new to DSLR cameras and I've spent the last few months playing with Adobe Photoshop elements 2 and the Canon converter since it came with my camera. I knew however that I was missing something since it took forever to process, plus, elements 2 can't handle 16 bit/channel which makes it kind of pointless to shoot RAW. So, I figured JPEG was the best bet until I read that the new Adobe photoshop had a new RAW converter which would allow both RAW converting and photoshop editing in the same program. However, the workflow issues were difficult unitl I found Fraser's book. It's VERY well written, very easy to follow (even if you're non-technically inclined) and when he does introduce very hard concepts (like editing text directly in .xml files) he explains them well or tells you why you either would or would not need to use them. In other words, he doesn't make you feel bad for not using some complicated feature meant only for pros.I loved his step by step presentation of ALL the sliders, how to use the alt or control key to check for clipping, how to fix an image and how to set personal camera preferences in the advanced box. I guarantee that even if you've never tried shooting in RAW, you'll be inspired to after reading this book. It's rare that I find a book so helpful and clear, but I have to admit that I loved this book and have already gone back through it several times with pleasure to look for smaller details. He deserves an A+

I've always been a fan of Hitchens through his Vanity Fair articles, but he outdoes himself here. Besides the fact that it's interesting for a left-winger to rake Clinton over the coals, it's really the acerbic prose that makes this short book so sharp. After reading a few duller books, Hitchens prose will leap off the page at you -- keep a dictionary nearby. I kept saying to myself -- wow, what a sentence, every couple of pages. Of course, the subject matter is engaging. Even if you happen to like Clinton, you can still imagine how his machinations and outright lies have eroded our confidence and his place in history as well. Some of the bald faced lies are hard to take, but Hitchens is such a good storyteller that the reader is completely carried away. I think both fans and enemies of Bill should read this book if nothing else to come to terms with a very topsy-turvey presidency. You'll appreciate how brave Hitchens was by the end of this short book.

Owning this collection is a much better idea than owning the other 2 box set collection for one simple reason: every Zeppelin album had a certain atmosphere and mood which is totally lost if you just string together random Zeppelin hits. How can you compare the acoustic sound and feel of Zeppelin III with a raucous and wild album like Presence? The band strived for unity and cohesion in their albums and sometimes refused to release any singles until much later than the album's release. To break up their hits into a best of collection seems like a crime.That's why this collection is so great -- all the original art work is preserved along with liner notes, an extra booklet is included with a complete retrospective/overview, the CD's are all remastered from the originals (and boy does that make a difference) and you have all 10 studio albums plus some bonus tracks like Hey Hey which were only released as B sides. There's really no way you could go wrong with this set unless you own all 10 albums. I owned maybe 4 of them, but I'm still glad I have the whole set now. It's very high quality too with nice cases, artwork, and extras. A first class release all the way and a must for Zeppelin collectors.

I should state outright that I'm not an HR professional -- this book is required reading for a course I'm taking. Rothwell writes a very professional (much more so than some of the other HR texts I've been assigned) and well designed textbook that makes it relatively easy to transition a traditional HR office to more of a Human performance office. Every once in a while you'll think to yourself, &quot;well isn't that obvious,&quot; (hire bright workers and you won't need to train them as much...), but Rothwell does provide charts and checklists that provide a blueprint to enact these ideas which can only help an organization be more productive. Highly recommended in its field.

I agree with all the praise given by my fellow amazon readers -- you learn as much about Nabokov by reading about his wife as you do by reading about him (which you can do in his excellent autobiographical novel Speak, Memory). My only small quibble is that the first half was a tad slow moving -- things definitely picked up once they arrived in the United States, especially the Cornell years. Having just read this book back to back with Nora (the biography of James Joyce's wife), I have to admit that as much as I enjoyed this book, I found Nora more gripping overall. Still, I would encourage anyone who loves Nabokov to read this book, even if you have to skip some of the denser parts. Hats off to Schiff who certainly did her research and presents everything you could ever want to know about Nabokov but were afraid to ask.

Many of the criticisms of this book take issue with the fact that this story is not told in a straightforward way. I think that is what makes it such a fine novel -- from the opening scene when family members gather to remember Billy, the plot dances around a few major plot events to give the perspective of different family members. Along the way, the reader is given an inside view of several generations of this extended Irish family with moving portraits of loss and longing weaving their way through the narrative. The novel is very evocative and recreates an old fashioned New York/Long Island neighborhood of Irish friends and neighbors and their inextricable ties to each other. There are some heartbreaking scenes, particularly when Billy travels to Ireland to visit his old love's grave. The plot is not what makes this an enticing novel; rather it is the meandering plot line and side bars that give it depth and emotion.

I've been on an astronomy roll lately -- this book is not easily categorized. It's not like the excellent intro books like Dickerson's Nightwatch, but it's also not the advanced format of a good star atlas. Its conversational style is very funny in parts with a healthy reverence for the cosmos. It serves as a nice complement to intro-intermediate books because of its wide range of coverage. He picks out his favorite sights (Betelgeuse, Sirius, the Harvest Moon (most people dont' know what it really is!), the Orion Nebula, etc... and provides an in-depth historical and scientific account of each. It's easy enough for a beginner, but even an advanced astronomer will learn something new. I read it all in one sitting and could not put it down.

Though I found the material fascinating (especially the chilling interview with Jeffrey Dahmer), I agree with the reviewers who note the egoism. Of course Ressler should be proud, but perhaps he should let others tout his accomplishments rather than doing it himself. It detracts from the cases he describes. It reminds me of the old Saturday Night Live skit when our hero bursts in with, &quot;Here I come to save the day...&quot; Despite the egomanical strain, there is lots of good information on behavior profiling here. The author could show a bit more empathy for the victims. He'll recount the most horrid crime as if it were the recipe for apple pie. I'm thankful for his dedication to crime and for his insights into profiles of the serial killer. I suspect his first book is more in depth than this one.

This is a terrific book. The rants on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair are enough to have you gasping for breath in the aisle, and that's before his brilliant comic creation, the pretentious, Ecole-educated Delphine Roux. Having spent many years in higher ed., I can attest to the fact that Roth is so on the mark that it's a bit frightening. He nails the entire feminist-marxist-elite on the head. For me, Roux's panic as she desperately looks for a mate in the New York Review of Books personals and by accident sends the email to her department is the highlight of the book. I have MET her before, I'm sure of it. My favorite pages of the book were the Roux monologues as she rationalizes her whole existence and her snobby education.I'm a longtime fan of Roth and have read almost all of his books, even the old ones, but this is one of his very best. He is just so &quot;on.&quot; His portraits of academia, politics, race-relations, plus his electrifying writing make this thrilling from start to finish. Previous to reading this book, I had read two &quot;light&quot; novels. After one page of Roth, I felt the power of words again.Not only is this one of Roth's best books, it's one of the best contemporary books period as it lampoons many areas of our lives. The whole &quot;spook&quot; incident was so lifelike (the black students the professor was supposedly insulting had never actually shown up in class and he had no idea that they were black since he'd never seen them) that I bet colleges everywhere are shaking in their own hypocrotical shoes. Roth emerges as one of the best 20th century chroniclers.

Elie Wiesel is usually the writer that comes to mind when anyone thinks of Holocaust literature, but that's a shame considering that Levi's books are all literary achievements of the highest order. I defy anyone to read any of Levi's books and not be moved by both the events described and the writing - this is one of the most moving descriptions of Levi's and worth buying and remembering. For my money, Levi is the greatest Holocaust writer of this century -- if you haven't savored his books, you should acquire and read them as soon as you can.

I've always liked Garry Shandling as a comedian. Perhaps that's why this book is so disappointing. Though you may laugh out loud once or twice, the impression is that he dashed this off in less than a week. Unlike his show, this book IS insulting to our intelligence. Read this book back to back with a brilliant master like Dave Barry and you will immediately see how not funny it is. The premise that he had sex with every beautiful hollywood star, as funny as it may seem, is a sorry pretext for an entire book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one -- I'm happy I read it in the library.

I'm a big fan of Baker having read all his previous books. I do appreciate some of the day to day instances that make up our lives (I even laughed a lot while I read them -- the piece on peeing standing up at night is quite funny) and love Baker's writing, but overall I found this a rather trite literary exercise in making small details central. Again, Baker manages to be witty and clever in spots, but as a novel, albeit a short one, this one falls short of his other books. Maybe it was the ranchy plots of Fermata and Vox that made those short novels more interesting than this one? In any case, you'll feel that you're reading Baker's real life thoughts as he lights the fire every morning at roughly 4am and that's less interesting that you might think. On the bright side, it won't take anyone more than an hour or so to read this novella, so you can't get too angry at the author for taking up your valuable time.

This is one of the most fantastic books ever written. It represents a kind of &quot;unified theory&quot; of math, art and music. In some ways, Hoffstader reminds me of Joyce's Ulysses in terms of the way he uses text to model a different form. In fact, Joyce writes a chapter which is a textual &quot;fugue&quot; just the way hoffstader does. Yes, this is a very dense book with lots of profound thoughts on art, math and music (and philosophy), but I guarantee that you'll find it interesting. Don't read it on a short airplane ride -- read it when you have some time for a deeper read. I read it years ago and look forward to re-reading it again since I have yet to find a book anything like it. Quite an achievement -- this is one to pick for the proverbial desert island.

We owe it to Sharon Stone that we even have this short fable at all -- she found it thanks to her perseverance tracking down a reference made to the screenplay.I agree with the writer below who notes that Jacob reminds him of Lenny in Steinbeck's work. He's not retarded, but he's immune to the lures of wealth and privilege. Despite the material promises stemming from his incredible ability to heal, he just wants a simple life with Sharon, the fallen character. Jacob has always loved Sharon -- the moment he cures her of her childhood disease, she literally runs off to be a singer. When Jacob finds her years later, they have the chance to go back and live in the &quot;desert&quot; (so many biblical allusions and overtones), but Sharon cannot give up the money left to her by a rich benefactor who was cured by Jacob but killed by his own inability to give up his disease.The writing is vivid and reads very much like the screenplay that it is. There is something very moving about Jacob's simplicity and inability to be corrupted. A powerful little fable, worthy of rediscovery.

These stories are all over the map -- from 17th century love letters between Peruvian saints to a 20th century mappist who devotes his life to his practice. This is my first encounter with Lopez, but his excellent writing is evident throughout. Though I didn't like all the stories (the Lords one was the weakest I thought), I found his subject matter so interesting and the ideas so gripping that I couldn't put it down. Lopez has a knack for creating a sense of place from the land. These stories contain some beautiful slices of Americana and some memorable scenes and characters. I love the story about the 17th century saints. Many gems in this short collection.

I don't want to take away from Ferrer's artistry by critizing this album, but the song selection is so ballad heavy that I find it ponderous. What I like best about all the other Cuban records is the drive and the energy. This disc was just too slow paced for me, song after song. I admit to my personal bias, so if you like ballads, by all means buy it. After hearing Ferrer's incredible version on the Putamayo CD of &quot;El compositor se equivoco,&quot; I was incredibly let down by this CD. Cooder was getting on my nerves as well on this recording.

I've read dozens of astronomy books in the past year, but this one is decidely different. Ferris manages to capture the awe and the appeal of amateur star-gazing in his self-effacing look at his own background and his encounters with other major figures like Stephen O'Meara. Though he hobnobs with many famous people (each chapter is a separate encounter), he never lets his ego get in the way. In fact, the opening chapters about his own poor upbringing in rural Florida set the scene for his later accomlishments. Even with no money and a cheap telescope, Ferris inspires by his self-taught methods of learning drawing and observing techniques. This book is not a how-to or a dictionary of astronomy, but rather a delightful romp through encounters with various telescopes, astronomers and hobbyists. The amateur shines in full glory as Ferris makes clear that the most lowly of us are capable of discovering new aspects of the cosmos. A lovely and inspiring read.

By now, the world is familiar with the Outside Magazine writer-turned novelist after Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. I did enjoy this narrative, but it strives too hard to imitate Krakeneur's style without succeeding very well. Sure, we have the present tense action sequences, the character shots (also not as nuanced as Junger and Krak.), the action, the unconquerable foe, but it's missing the emotional ummmff that the others had. I couldn't get over the feeling that I was reading a formula (now some background of the area, then a look at the characters, the scouting, the set up, the river, etc...)On its own merits, the author does a nice job providing background to previous Himalyas exploration and expeditions and captures quiet nicely the river its incredible force. It's simply not as sharp as the others in its genre -- one too many &quot;oh and did I mention that rescue was impossible&quot; that an editor should have caught. Still, it's a pageturner that should entertain anyone interested in experiencing the thrill of white water kayaking and understanding a bit of the mystique behind the sport. Despite my small complaints, I did enjoy the book.

What Philip Roth does so well is create the kind of character complexity that allows the reader to be attracted and repulsed by our randy protagonist at the same time. Much of this has to do with the fact that Kepesh knows himself so well -- he freely admits when he is using someone for his own erotic desires, his studied seductions of students, etc... Yet, he's also emminently likeable at the same time and not so cynical that he doesn't actually fall in love with Consuela at a deeper level. Consuela is well drawn too and between their interaction, Roth's terrific writing and the smaller scale of this book, I imagine Roth devotees will love this book and even new Roth recruits will understand why he's such a great writer and representer of the male psyche.

Okay, I confess: I plagiarized the adjective beguiling from the back cover, but it was the best one word phrase I could come up with to describe this quirky book. In some senses, it reminds me of a detective narrative, a kind of Egyptian Oedipus who is searching for the &quot;truth.&quot; The story in this case revolves around this monotheistic pharaoh and his peculiar religious leadership and reign. I'm not an expert at the history of the period -- my above reviewer points out several inaccuracies which if true would be disappointing to me. After reading 15 or so different interviews of those close to Akhenaten, some of the mysteries are resolved. It's a short read and quite a unique narrative that will transplant you to ancient Egypt. It's amazing at times how modern the narrative feels. How much really separates sexual escapades of someone like Clinton from those of the ancients? Not much as we see from our study of history. A bit offbeat, but a good read on an intriguing subject.

It took awhile for this book to make an impact, but what an impact it makes! The reader is a bit thrown off by the opening pages which contain a grant proposal to study the life of the most famous artist of the generation. Once the story is begun, it is so captivating that it's easy to forget the opening and get lost. The plot follows a young aspiring artist who can't seem to find his metier. He goes to Paris but just can't seem to fit in and instead returns to L.A. to try to make his mark. Rather than pursue art, he ends up rooming with an odd cast of characters (one of whom never bathes) and making money as a handyman. Though he's not particularly handy in terms of fixing things, he has a therapeutic effect on everyone he comes across. In short, he ends up fixing egos and lost souls rather than doing a bang up job with the laundry machine. See is such a fantastic writer that everything works -- the prose carries us from one oddball family to another. The beauty of the book is that once you reach the end, you could spend an hour re-reading the first two pages and saying &quot;Ah HAH -- now I get it.&quot; The characters are so eccentric and interesting and the main character so compelling that it's hard not to be taken in by this thoroughly charming and well-crafted book.

I loved O'Reilly's book (the O'Reilly factor) which succeeds at every point where this book fails. Does anyone really care about Ted's every waking thought spread over 365 entries? Sound contrived and tedious? It is! If I hadn't been delayed on a runway for 6 hours, I would never have gotten through the book, but I was stuck for reading material. I really started to hate Ted by the end of the book for making me this disinterested in some very interesting world events. The problem is, even his interesting thoughts get buried in the mundane details of his family life which, unless you really want to hear about all the visits with his grandchildren, are not that interesting.I guess the best way to classify the book is self-indulgent, as if we all should jump up and down for joy that a famous newsman took the time to give us his daily thoughts for a whole year. The trouble is, I doubt anyone alive today could produce an interesting book from this premise (a daily diary), and certainly not Mr. Koppel. Not even Madonna or any Hollywood star could hold our interest through a year's worth of daily events. If you care about Ted deeply, you may enjoy this book, but for everyone else, I wouldn't recommend it despite many interesting points of view buried within.

To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. This pretentious and overblown work aspires to be philosophical and grand-scale (a modern day Ulysses perhaps, but I shudder to compare this work to Ulysses which is one of my all time favorites) but is almost totally unreadable. Sure there are great snippets and some great writing, but unless you're planning on taking weeks out of your schedule, you simply will not be able to follow the threads. I'm happy to admit any shortcomings on my part as a reader for those inclined to criticize my lack of apprehension, but this work of genius really eluded me. I'll even say it went over my head. Having just finished Stendhal's The Red and the Black which was an enjoyable experience, I found reading this one a chore that I barely made it through.As I said, I did enjoy specific passages and some of the sub plots, but the pretentions to greatness and the obtuseness of the narrative wore me down. Good luck trying to get through it.

Everyone I've ever recommended this book of stories to has loved it and spent the time searching out all of Ingalls's books. Like Jonathan Carroll, her books and stories start out realistically and then slowly lead the reader to strange and unusual places with ease. Reading Ingalls is an imaginative experience that should not be missed. Her books are all short but profound.

Unlike most Holocaust literature, this collection, though it starts in Hungary, focuses on life after the Holocaust. I enjoyed the early stories more - the ones that showed how Dana's parents met and lived in Hungary both before and after the war. Once they get to Canada, we mostly see the various schools Dana attends and how her parents adjust -- the heartbreaking part is that her strong father, Apu, has the wind taken out of his sails once he leaves Hungary. Her once strong father walks with stooped shoulders. I did enjoy this collection and would recommend it. There's something lacking (perhaps lack of soul or depth) that prevents the reader from becoming 100% engaged, but it's hard to put your finger on it. Nonetheless, an impressive debut.

In case you didn't already know it, Steve Martin is SMART and witty. As a longtime fan, I've appreciated his humor for some time, but casual fans might not realize that he can really write too. Sure, not every piece is brilliant, but there are some real gems and imaginative ruminations. I particularly love the one when Martin, in his quest to join Mensa, stumbles into a Mensa party, &quot;I worried that the 132 cutoff point might be arbitrary until I met someone with an IQ of 131, and honestly, he was a bit slow on the uptake. If you have a dinner party of 132s and there's a 131 attending, you can actually feel the 131er hit the wall of stupidity.&quot; If that isn't good deadpan humor, what is these days? My absolute favorite essay is the closing one, &quot;A Word from the Words&quot; (written by underpants). While this word commiserates with pimple, he adds, &quot;He walked around here with a hangdog look, and even tried to be friends with hangdog look, but around here, a phrase won't mingle with a word; they just won't.&quot; I love that. This essay is sidesplittingly funny and inventive. He actual reminds me of some of Woody Allen's earlier writings -- I suspect Martin had read Allen since some of his essays are very reminiscent: My Apology (Allen's classic on Socrates) for example.My only complaint was that there weren't more of these essays. I love getting inside Martin's mind and swimming around with him. Not every one is perfect, but as a collection, they are very strong.

Whatever profession you work in, you will fall behind if you don't understand the principles that Friedman explains so well. Like From Beirut to Jerusalem, this book is extremely well-written and well-told. It's by no means an easy read, but Friedman helps us out by weaving stories from his travels around the globe and giving enough examples so that even non-technological folk will have no problem following his argument. Suddenly you'll understand why the US must be concerned with crises in other countries. No longer will we be able to say, &quot;Well, that's not OUR problem.&quot; That kind of attitude will lead to recession and economic crisis not just in the US, but abroad as well. The interconnectedness of the world is what spurs on globabization, whether we like it or not. Once you read his stories about visiting remote Chinese villages during elections, you'll understand why we should care what happens in these far off places.Friedman spends a good deal of time distinguishing between cold war politics and economics and post-cold war. From his explanations, even a layman can follow the drastic differences in every aspect of the economy. The reader even learns how to evaluate a country's real progress (sometimes &quot;PC's per household&quot; or connections per household). Although this is a ponderous books at times, Friedman's sense of humor shows through -- by the end, you'll understand why if France was a stock, he'd sell. The French take a beating for their lack of forward looking vision. This book is mandatory reading for any US citizen who wants to understand our past and future role in the rapidly expanding world.

This book will go down in history as one of the finest battle accounts ever written. Though Herodotus and Thucydides are pretty good too, this book takes on modern warfare and gives you 200 pages of the most &quot;you are there&quot; writing you could imagine. I could NOT put it down and read it in several hours nonstop. O'Brien's The Things They Carried (short stories on Vietnam) is the closest I can recall that gives the absolute horror of real injuries, loss of limbs, loss of intestines, etc... The reality of war is that it's not at all romantic -- it's blood guts and suffering.You'll be amazed at how resistant the Somalies were and how the Americans' lack of sensitivity in the months before the battle caused lots of the problems. I like the way the author presents a balanced view of the battle that makes us consider both sides of the coin and decide for ourselves who was at fault. Well written, well-paced and well-researched. Excellent.

Usually I'm against movie versions of my favorite books because I feel violated when they don't meet my expectations. Still, when I read this book originally, I dreamt of a movie because the novel lends itself so well to a brilliant cinematic interpretation of old New York. Having grown up in New York City, I really appreciated Finney's recreation of a lost world. It's a beautiful novel with a bit of mystery, intrigue, romance, magic all rolled up into one memorable title. I didn't even know there was a sequel, but I'm running to buy it now. No New York fan should miss Helprin's A Winter's Tale either!

...I've always been a Martin fan so I thought I'd pick up his first novel. It gives us a short vignette of vacuous LA life lived on anti-depressents, meaningless jobs and brief encounters. Where Martin excels is in his descriptions and some biting commentary on empty L.A. life. If you weren't a big fan of California life to start, this book won't help. Martin's humor does show through in parts: "In L.A. you can live in the tiniest apartment in the tiniest cul de sac with a 1/4 in your address and twenty minutes after placing an order a foreigner will knock on your door bearing yam fries and meatless meatloaf." I love that.It's impossible to identify with any of the characters, but I don't think Martin expects us to. He loosley sketches these characters and they populate the story like ghosts never making too much of an impression. There is some artistry at work here. I enjoyed this novella, but I have the feeling that if the author weren't well known, it would never have been published with such fanfare. Still, recommended as a quick read.

I'm not totally heartless -- I did enjoy this very brief book (for a fast reader, maybe a full hour's worth) by Nicholas Sparks for its sweet and idealistic story of true love as seen through a the young Landon. Sparks certainly does his best to keep up that nice boy image for both himself and his characters. Everyone is disgustingly wholesome and even the &quot;bad&quot; boys at worst have a box of camels rolled up their sleeves. It's not that the book is bad, it's just as many have pointed out: manipulative tear-jerking stuff that appeals the most to 17 year old girls. Still, as I said, I enjoyed the plot, although by about page 10 I pegged most of it. The narrator is very likable though so I found myself enjoying, not &quot;wading through&quot; the relatively straightforward prose. I don't think Sparks portrays himself as a great writer, so I can't begrudge him his fame for this genre. I'd rather read a sweet, sappy book by a well-intentioned writer than a slasher book any day. Sparks will remind many of Richard Paul Evans, another writer who writes agreeable books that seem ready for a Hallmark Hall of Fame special. Worth reading though for a quick and uplifting read.

I read all the reviews before deciding to try these out and I happen to love them. A word of advice: it's all about the fit. I have small ears so the Ipod ones, although not bad, don't fit into my ear all the way so I lose a lot of the sound. To me they sound tinny and lightweight, but when my husband put them in his ears, he thought they sounded fine. Then when I got my new Sony's (which are MUCH cheaper on amazon than in the apple store where they are full retail price) I really noticed a difference -- they fit right into my ears snugly, block out all other sound and have much better bass, much stronger mid range too. Really just a much more 3 dimensional sound. The key part is that they fit. Since they come with 3 sizes of earbud, I suspect anyone would be able to get them to fit. They look cool too -- you can't tell from the photo on amazon, but they have some neat shiny silver highlights. I love the feature that others complained about, namely that the right side is longer -- it's so you can put it AROUND your neck, very convenient when you have to pop them out to talk to someone. With the Ipod headphones, you have to let them hang, but with these, they rest around you neck. I didn't have any problems with them slipping out during exercise either -- if the fit is snug, they stay in there. In short, for the money, they sound great, look great and fit great. I like them a lot better than the stock Ipod headphones, but if those happen to fit your ears just right, you may not need anything else. My only small complaint is the cheap plastic case and the poor directions for how to wind the cord around that cheap plastic piece. I don't bother with the two cases but if they had been more solid and had better illustrated directions, it would have been perfect!

Though I didn't feel that there was any shocking bit of new information, I did enjoy reading the candid comments of many CEO's regarding their perceptions of women. No surprise that many are intimidated by the very smart women that have risen to their level. I did feel that at times the differences between men and women were exaggerated somewhat, but the author does provide helpful pointers at the end of each chapter that are meant to help the reader put theory into practice. Most interesting is the idea that many top CEOs cite graciousness at the top quality they think makes them a strong leader -- I think men have learned something from women here as women are more likely than men to share the credit. Humility and graciousness go a long way, both in the business world and out. A good read with some useful information.

It's true what some of my fellow reviewers have said about the organizational quirks and the unspectacular prose, but I have to say that this book still makes for a riveting read. Delong may seem a bit puffed up about herself at times, but I think that's our jaded view of females in male jobs nowadays. Considering what a pioneer she was as one of the first female agents (not to mention an Irish Catholic divorcee with a young son), I think we could be a bit more generous. The opening few chapters are very engaging -- they describe dozens of big cases that she helped break or observed first hand. Though it's not the author's fault, it was overwhelming to read about the number of sex offenders and crazed killers who prowl around in our country. Her final chapter gives many good tips at coping with daily situations that have the potential to turn into life threatening ones. I wish the editor or the author had taken out some of the repeated stuff (her occupation as a psych nurse and many double and triple mentions of explanatory material from earlier chapters). Some of the chapters are quite funny too -- the Candy chapter on the "prostitute ring" is memorable for its zany staging and final outcome. I really enjoyed reading first hand about FBI culture.This book is not without it faults, but on the whole it was by turns engrossing, inspiring and sobering.

Sula is shorter and easier to understand than Morrison's two masterpiece longer works, Song of Solomon and Beloved, but that does not mean that it's not a work of great literature. Sula is beautifully written and powerfully rendered. The scenes between Nel and Sula, plus the odd cast of characters like Chicken Little will haunt you long after you finish. Her dialogue is fantastic. Curiously, the last three years when I have taught this book to high school students, the women all loved it and most of the guys didn't. Maybe it's hard for white teen age boys to see the angst of young black girls growing up? Or maybe it's just that as a growing up story of the friendship between two childhood friends, boys that age don't find it that interesting. I agree with the reader below who remarks on the &quot;magic realism&quot; style -- I have always been struck by the way Morrison includes fantanstic elements in her novels: kind of a black folklore meets magic realism confluence. A great read and an important one to her overall corpus.

You will never be the same after reading A Winter's Tale. It's sheer lyric beauty and dazzling prose will stay with you long after you close the last page. You can feel the cold, you can imagine the lost world of New York, you can be totally absorbed by Helprin's magic realism of sorts as he transports you to an earlier time. No one who likes New York should miss this book. After rereading it recently, I realized that few books I have ever read hold together as well as this one, surely Helprin's masterpiece. Jack Finney's Time and Again is the only book that comes close to that turn of the century New York, but it's not nearly the work of genius that this is. Savor it and reread it every few years.

If you liked Into Thin Air or The Perfect Storm, search out all of Ella Maillart's books. She was a female adventurer back when women didn't even travel to civilized places, much less uncivilized ones. Her books are inspiring to read. I'm amazed at all the places she sought out around the globe. What a woman!

This is my first experience with Sandra Brown. Judging from other reviewer's comments, this is not her finest book. Perhaps it's because I just finished Madame Bovary and some other more literary books, but this book was very mediocre. Sure, the plot was fast paced and kept me entertained for a couple of hours. My objection is to the feeling that I'm being manipulated as a reader. For example, many chapters end with the, &quot;Just then, a piercing scream rang out,&quot; type of thing that propels you to the next chapter. It's hard for me to believe that this kind of mediocre writing comes from a bestselling author (or should that be considered par for the course from a bestselling author?). The sex scene was SO poorly written that it was painful to read. I felt like I was reading a teenager's English paper under some horrible forced assignment: try to make a sex scene sound sexy. I'm not trying to pick on her, but if you read this outloud to a friend, you'd be laughing so hard you'd never make it through it.So, decent entertainment I suppose, but not very impressive as fine writing.

I'll admit first off that Murakami is one of my all time favorites and I've read every one of his novels available in English. I still think his masterpiece is The Wind Up Bird Chronicle for its sheer mass and scope, but I was impressed by this novel for just the opposite. In this rather short and seemingly simple novel, some of the deepest and most profound thoughts and events take place. Like our narrator in Norwegian wood, we have a young man devoted to a girl, in this case the lovable Sumire. Unfortunately, she feels no desire for him and instead falls in love with a married women. This is where things turn into Vintage Murakami with surrealistic events taking place (old Murakami fans will think of the elevator to another time zone type of thing). Here, Sumire disappears and our narrator sets out in search of her. What he ultimately discovers is what the reader will uncover.The prose is very sparse compared to his other novels, but I think Murakami does well in this kind of minimalist style which has a seething undercurrent lurking just beneath the surface. The emotions are heartfelt and deep -- our narrator suffers for his love and devotion. Not only another excellent Murakami novel, but an accessible one that should earn him some new fans. Hopefully this novel will direct new readers to his earlier masterworks.

I could even forgive the ego if the writing weren't so dreadful. For me, the fact that he adores his wife and beautiful twin daughters makes up somewhat for his arrogance, but nothing makes up for this writing which makes the Let's Go guides look like Flaubert. Plus, the editing was weak in that we jump ALL OVER the place with no logical starts and finishes. I enjoyed all the travelogues (even though I hate that present tense stuff -- I see the lion, it moves towards me) but just as you're getting into the Talibans, boom, you're in Borneo. I feel like I read the first half of 30 short stories. Plus, a book like this with not ONE map seems a shame since Pelton has visited some great places. What was the publisher thinking not to include maps.Though I enjoyed the stories and even the parts about the author's upbringing (I didn't find much egoism here), this book falls short in the adventure genre since so many others write so much better.

Granted there are many good insights within the pages of this book. But if you made it to where you are in life and you never realized that people in organizations have many different learning styles, you must be a bit slow on the uptake. The authors of this book give us one way to understand and quantify how people are different. An &quot;extrovert&quot; might throw out 10 ideas, but only mean one of them to be serious, while an &quot;introvert&quot; might keep an idea to himself rather than risk ridicule. No doubt the seminars they do with companies make workers and leaders more aware of how others respond around them and that is of course a good thing. Though I found the book enjoyable reading, oftentimes it seemed too generalized or overcategorized. In short, it certainly doesn't hurt to acknowledge that that are many different types in the workplace, but you don't need to study the 16 combinations to really make yourself that much more of an expert about it. This being said, the authors do offer lots of helpful advice for how to deal with those who are very opposite to your type.

If you like hi fidelity audio and for some reason have not discovered Mapleshade recordings, you are in for a big treat. &quot;Bookie&quot; has played with EVERYONE is jazz: Cannonball Adderly, Sarah Vaughan (her bassist from 1975-81) John Hicks, Pharoah Sanders, Stan Getz -- you get the idea. This is a swinging CD with incredible bass playing on some jazz classics, all played with terrific musicians. This quintet storms through their repoirtoire with poise and ease. Once you've fallen in love with 'Shades, you'll want to buy more of them for their high quality audio and great musicians. This is one of my favorites.

Wow. Even if you've read everything Murakami ever wrote, you can't pass on this one because it is at once everything in his past books as well a a totally new experience. Though the book may seem intimating, Murakami's genius lies in his accessiblity and universal themes despite the Joycean range of motifs, writing styles and avantguard literary techniques. I think a fair parallel can be made to Joyce's work on many different levels. Much the way Ulysses brought together many earlier details from Portrait of an Artist, Stephen Hero, Exiles and The Dead, so too does Murakami pull all the threads together from earlier works. I read this book in one LONG sitting because I was totally riveted. It's the kind of book that makes you want to go back and reread all his earlier works to shed light on those as well. If I'm not mistaken, the early short story collection The Elephant Vanishes provides the opening for Wind-Up. Don't miss this -- he will become your favorite author!

After you've been cooking for a while, you start to ask yourself questions like, &quot;Do I really need to add oil to my pasta water?&quot; or, &quot;What exactly is cream of tartar?&quot; If you are interested in ingredients and combinations of cooking, this is the book for you. A year ago a friend turned me onto the magazine Cook's Illustrated which is fantastic. This book collects 700+ of their classics from the last several years in one place. More than the recipes themselves, I like the narrative of how they start with all the classic recipes and then do exhaustic scientific experiments (often consulting food scientists) until they have everything just right. Since I often do minor experiments myself and find that I've messed up an entire meal, it's nice to let the test kitchen take on this role. Even more gratifying, sometimes it turns out that the fancy complicated recipe does not produce better tasting results than a more streamlined one. I've cooked lots of these recipes and ever single one has come out perfectly.On top of the recipes, you will find answers to questions you just don't have time to figure out: which supermarket olive oil tastes best? Which tuna fish is the tastiest? What's the difference between rib eye, London Broil and Flank steak? I've never been so interested in a cookbook. I read the whole thing through over a long week of reading and can't wait to experiment by trying more of their recipes. If you like this book, subscribe to the magazine!

Having recently purchased a telescope, I've been reading lots of astronomy books. Even though this one is very basic, overall I've found it the most useful. No math, no equations, but tons of helpful advice that will have you up and finding stars right away. I like the fact that he emphasizes how much you can see with binocs too. The star charts are very helpful and are printed so that they can be read by a red light while you're out observing. Lots of great information on how to buy a telescope too. The bound version is perfect for carrying with you to find objects in the sky. Well written, easy to follow and informative -- if you only buy one book, this should be it (although I'd have to add my all time favorite, The Stars by H.A. Ray, the only book that draws the constellations so that they actually look like pictures).

What makes this book so readable is its pervasive and sly sense of humor. The author doesn't take himself too seriously and writes hilarious scenes with Roger, Francis' stuffy Harvard husband who spends the day locked up in his basement competing with other high IQ crossword puzzle nerds and writing &quot;IQ 181&quot; on his resume. The interior monologues that cover Roger's thoughts as he plots the perfect murder of his adulterous wife are hilarious. The other character who gets a good dose of the humor is the lovable villain, Whitney (Donald!) who is a total nutcase, convicted murderer and very caught up in his own proficiency level. Exactly when he thinks he's humming along doing something brilliant, we see that he's drinking too much and wandering far from his simple mission to kill Francis.Some have criticized the coincidences and gimmicks, but I really didn't find them intrusive at all. I think that kind of critique misses the point that the author is creating a somewhat absurd set of circumstances to highlight some of the plotting and conventions of detective stories. For sure, his style is engaging and his characters very well drawn. This book was enjoyable from start to finish and a pageturner to boot.

I'm still overwhelmed by the scope and depth of this atlas. Every page contains beautiful images and maps that could take your breath away.....it would have been nice to have included some basic information or supplementary information -- basically, you get maps, take it or leave it. Sometimes I have trouble figuring out the projection method since they are taken from different slices for different maps. I'm still a beginner, so in some ways this atlas is daunting, but I know when I'm at a real dark sky site, this atlas will provide years of enjoyment. A worthwhile investment.

Jonathan Carroll is one of my all time favorite writers and I have tracked down (in libraries) over the years all of his books. This is still one of my very favorites. It makes you wish you could spend a day inside Carroll's mind to see how he comes up with his fantasy world. The writing is so fresh and so dreamlike -- I dare anyone not to fall in love with this book. Seek out all of his books and you will not be sorry.

This was one of my favorite books of the year. Although it is very original, it did remind me of Motherless Brooklyn which tells a detective story through a child with Turret's Syndrome. Haddon in this novel captures perfectly a high functioning autistic child who decides to write a novel about the search for the cold blooded murderer of his neighbor's poodle with a garden fork. His quest leads to all sorts of interesting discoveries about those around him. I don't want to give away the plot, but you won't be able to put down this highly original book. The attention to details and the care Haddon takes in drawing his main character shows and makes this a highly accomplished and most memorable novel.

Well, with two dogs and two kids, there is a lot of gross stuff in our carpets. Actually, I didn't realize how bad it was because it seems more or less clean after we vaccuum, but we bought this machine after our baby puked all over the carpet. Not only did it get out all the stains, it's easy to use and smells great too! In fact, we were as pleased with the deodorizing part as we were with the cleaning part (we mixed in the pet oder stuff along with the fiber cleaing stuff). I'm a technical idiot, but this thing is VERY easy to use. It's no harder than pushing a vacuum. I'd recommend using a bit less water than the directions say, but otherwise, the directions were very clear and easy to follow (and even in English!). Once you figure out the controls, it takes no more than 15 minutes to steam clean a large room. Be sure to take time to let it DRY since it takes about 5-10 hours. We turned on the heat and all the ceiling fans and even though it felt very wet, it was dry less than a half day later. haven't tried it yet on upholstery, but we're working our way through the house. Great product and solid investment. Once you see how much hair and dirt this machine picks up even right after you've vaccuumed, you'll be sold too.

Sure, the critics are right for voicing the opinion that only a small handful of recordings are recommended -- I found the recommendations somewhat capricious (and many fine recordings were left out), but that's not the aim of the book. The portraits of each composer are very well written and give even the novice a good overview of the life of each composer and his significant works. The authors admit in the intro that they are not out to write an exhaustive list of every major work -- actually, I liked the fact that they picked out each composers best works rather than reviewing all of them, even the bad. For readers trying to build a collection, this emphasis on the best pieces is helpful. The organization of the book and the layout is excellent providing quick and easy information. The Penguin guide features many more recordings (and less on each composer and his history), but the Rough guide is equally as useful. I plan to pick up the Penguin guide to balance out the small faults of this volume. Highly recommended overall with good text boxes that explain many major movements and types of music.

I was impressed by Rowling's latest entry into the Potter canon! For the first time the kids seem like real kids with emotional outbursts, sulky moments and petty fights. Everyone got along so well (in the group of friends of course -- we'd have to exclude the odious Draco, Crabbe et al) in previous books that I'd sometimes wonder when we'd see any real middle school behavior! The last 100 pages are clearly the most gripping part of the book, but there are many excellent moments leading up to the grand finale. Lots of clever bits as usual (I love the O.W.L.S. and NEWTS and the secret room that knows what you need -- don't we all need one of these!) and fun side plots (the Weasley brother's joke business and Hagrid's misadventures) that keep you glued. If you're already a fan, there's nothing not to like. For the newly initiatiated, you'd have to be completely devoid of imagination not to enjoy the ride. Kudos to Rowling for keeping her standards high.

Don't expect a mindbending Agatha Christie novel when you pick up Fitzgerald's first novel -- it's much more of a British farce making fun of the stuffy art critic world, the English in general (the main character has to deal with his wife Haggie who finds him uninspiring and boring) and anything to do with pretension. The whole premise of the novel is funny: people are queueing for days in the cold for this incredible exhibition of the so called Golden Child, but it turns out to be a fake. At one point, the main character is strangled by the &quot;golden thread&quot; that is supposedly a key part of the exhibit. There is a superb scene when the main character actually is trying to kill time to avoid his wife and decides to stand on line to see the exhibit for himself. He develops a feeling of solidarity with the people in line who share war stories about their wait to see the statue for the brief 20 seconds they are allotted. Fitzgerald captures perfectly this &quot;fan mania&quot; that anyone who has ever lined up for an event will enjoy reading. He chickens out right before actually seeing the exhibit and never makes it. The mystery part of the book is not that great, but the hilarious characters and dry satire make it an enjoyable read.

Even with my less than stellar handwriting, I've had no problems having my PDA recognize my writing. This program will simplify your life if you've always wanted to jot things down in your own handwriting instead of using graffiti. It's a snap to write quick notes and set alarms. IF you use your PDA a lot for jotting down a quick phone number, grocery list or reminder, you'll want to get this right away. For those who never liked graffiti, your time has come!

For anyone who keeps important information on their iPAQ for work, you'll want Handango's Security Guard to make sure it isn't accessible to everyone and his brother! It's like the equivalent of zonealarm software for your IPAQ. This software is very easy to use and provides a high level of security, especially for your most sensitive files. In these days of increasing piracy and access, you'll want to have this secruity protect to protect your information. I'm not a tech genius, but I had no problem figuring out how to use this. Definitely worth the price.

Once you use this, you'll wonder how you ever used your pocket PC without it. Even the most scattered person will improve his efficiency with this affordable software. As far as I've seen, this is simply the best Pocket PC title out there. It allows you to personalize your contacts, tasks, memos, notes any way you want with relative ease. The most useful part is that it recognizes your handwriting and allows you to setalarms and reminders for yourself. You can even link files and contact to dates and modify appointments by dragging and dropping, create appointments, and prioritize your agenda for the day. Considering it's so cheap, I'd call it a must have.

If you use a Blackberry, you'll want this product. Finally you can have Microsoft Word and Excel files right on your BlackBerry. The nice thing is that when you're out of the office you can simply direct the software in this suite to automatically forward attachments to you, even zip files! How nifty is that? No longer does the Blackberry user have to lug around a laptop. Another nice feature is that if you need a specific document from your computer, you can use a few basic commands to have them emailed to your BlackBerry. Whoever designed this software package knew what they were doing! An absolute must for the ultimate in portable convenience.

My problem is that I have too many passwords. For those who were worried about losing passwords or exposing their PDA's to outsiders, this is one security program you'll be glad to add to your arsenal. With this easy to use software, the user can keep numbers, passwords and URLs secure and safe. YOu can carry all your business information with you with the confidence that you are the only one who will be able to use it. Especially since some people have the tendency to misplace their PDA's, I would imagine almost anyone who uses one will want to use this.

After reading through almost all the available guides to England and Scotland, I chose to bring this one with me to Scotland because it was the best overall. Fodors is not bad, but it's just not organized as well as this one is. It lists more places to stay, but what I liked about this book is that he focuses on a few places that are superb. I'm also a fan of the insight guides, but I didn't see one for Scotland on the day I spent looking for books at a bookstore. We stayed at his most highly recommended B and B's and every single recommendation was on the mark. We even showed his descriptions to the proprietors of the B and B's who were impressed. This is the only book I found that really goes in depth in three areas that really matter: where to stay, what to see and what to eat. The introductory sections on history and background were very well done and should provide any traveller with the basic information to enjoy Scotland. In the book, the author devotes his two longest chapters to Edinborough and Glascow, but unlike other guides, he does an excellent job on the highlands (the northern ones) and the Grampian highlands. Since we spent most of our time in those two areas, I can say that he was very on target as far as what is worth seeing, how to get there, and how to plan your time. My cover looks different from the one pictured above: it's blue and has &quot;Open Road Guide&quot; on the top. I hope I'm referring to the same book -- the publication date is the same. If you are planning to go to Scotland and see some truly rugged and inspiring places, this book will help you appreciate the beauty of this rugged country. It avoids the temptation to cover too much information. It's just right in terms of providing detailed descriptions, particularly of the guest houses and the country side.

I have to admit straight out that Murakami is one of my all time favorite authors. I've read all of his available books including the tightly wound &quot;Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.&quot; Just about all his previous books are complex in terms of the almost supernatural events that seem to take place, switches in time periods, and other narrative oddities. In one sense, this is the most &quot;normal&quot; of Murakami's books in terms of narration, but it would be a mistake to think it's less complex. Yes, it's a lyrical and moving love story, but the writing is so exquisite and the characters so endearing (Reiko, Naoko and even Storm Trouper will stay in my mind for a long time) that when it ended, I went back and started reading again from the beginning. It's been a long time since a book compelled me to re-read right away.I don't think the parallel is unfounded with Magic Mountain -- Murakami's narrator just happens to be reading it while Naoko is trying to get through her emotional despair in a sanitorium of sorts. Like Hans C., no one seems to really get better and time seems to slow to a stop during the scenes in the home. Some of the most touching scenes take place during Toru's visits to Reiko and Naoko. Toru is such a gentle and human character -- we experience real sensuality through his interactions with other women. Maybe it's Murakami's perfectly controlled prose that makes this such a work of art. It is so beautiful that it will make you cry. These characters are so real, it can be frightening at times.This book is a good introduction to Murakami because of its surface simplicity, but anyone who enjoyed it should run out and buy his other books which are also terrific. Although I like Mishima too, I think Murakami is the greatest living Japanese writer. Don't miss this one.

I have to admit that I was so engrossed by the plot that I stayed up almost all night to finish the book. Unlike the guilty feeling I had after enjoying the Da Vinci code while realizing that it was not a great book, I really LOVED this book. I absolutely loved his wild and crazy read of Jesus and the founding of Christianity as a CIA type plot carried out by Roman agents. That chapter in particular, the translation of the "Amphora Scroll," was exceeding clever. Sure, there are implausibilities in the old guys whipping the young guys, but that's what gives the book its spirit. I get the feeling the author had a twinkle in his eye while he wrote this. It's like that movie with Clint Eastwood and Tommy lee Jones (I forgot the title) when they decide to go into space even though they are old geezers. I really enjoyed the lessons on falconry too. This is a first rate spy novel -- if his earlier books are that good, I'm quitting my review right now and ordering them!

If this were only a tell all of the restaurant trade, it would have worn thin after a chapter or two of disgusting practices (I'm still cringing from the description of seafood on Mondays, well done anything, certain sauces that smack of &quot;preservation&quot; of foul meat or fish)in the world's kitchens. But, much like his personality,he jumps between biography (both auto and of interesting people he's worked with) expose, how-to, rants, etc.... That's what makes it interesting. I don't know how people could say he's conceited. I've never read any writer which such a good grasp of who he is. Bourdain is brutally honest about his fancy upbringing (and contrasts it sharply with that of the mostly South and Central American men who are the staple of the entire food industry), his desolate years, his drug habits, his puerile forays into better kitchens than his current level -- he will keep you in stitches while at the same time giving a no-holds barred view of what it's like to be a chef. It's definitely not for most normal people, and he explains why truly there are very few fine chefs. He'll make you appreciate the line cook who really does all the prep work and major cooking -- you want that person to be boring and regular, not an innovator at all! You'll learn why. After reading &quot;a day in the life,&quot; you'll realize just what a sinecure your 100 hour a week investment bank job is -- you'd never believe the skills and organizational ability necessary to run a busy kitchen.This turned out to be one of my favorite reads of the year. I stayed up until almost 2am to finish it. It may have been irregular (the writing) in places, but that's fine in the context of this book which jumps around a lot. He's a fine writer and a great storyteller. His chapter on how people like us should cook is eye-opening to say the least. Anytime your friends tell you than they have to have a fancy set of Henkels knives, refer them to this chapter. Definitely worthwhile reading and a good break from heavier fiction.

Although Virgil spent years writing the Aeneid, by his death, he felt that it was imperfect and asked that it be burned. Luckily for all concerned, his request was denied or we'd never have this epic. If you are new to Greek and Roman epics, I'd recommend starting with the Iliad and the Odyssey first. Not only will most novices find them more readable (especially the Odyssey), any reader will pick up important background information that will help immeasurably in following the Aeneid. Although I'm a huge fan of the Aeneid and have read many of the books in the original Latin, I'd suggest to most readers just to read books 1,2,4 and 6 unless you are really drawn in. It's not that the other books are not great (they are), it's just that unless you are a specialist, you won't want to read all about the battles and extra stuff -- book 4 is the love story of Dido and Aeneus and for many is the highlight of the poem. Book 6 is the trip to to the underworld which is so important to later writers and poets like Dante, TS Eliot, etc.... The fall of Troy is contained in books 1 and 2. I enjoy Fitzgerald's translation, but as an amateur Latinist, I prefer Allan Mandelbaum's translation with Moser's illustrations. When I was translating from the Latin, only Mandelbaum was so close to the original that he could help a student. I think Mandelbaum is a genius for rendering the poem so close to the original. It's unfair to call him wooden -- Virgil wrote the whole thing in Dacytlic hexameter which is hardly wooden in Latin, although it can be repetitive at times. Not to worry -- he used a lot of spondaic substititions (altering a long, short short with a long, long) to vary the meter.So, if you just want a taste, read books 1,2,4 and 6 and if you love it, by all means read the whole epic.

I don't mean to insult this CD because it's really catchy and almost every song is good, but I had to give it 4 stars since so many other recent CD's (including Putumayo's Arabic Groove) have been a bit more uniformly strong throughout. It may be my own personal taste -- this CD is a bit more pop sounding and I tend to like the more traditional sounding music. Still, it's great to bounce around to in the car. I love Arabic music and this is a worthy edition to your collection.

After reading pretty much the gamut of Everest books from Into Thin Air to more obscure books by other climbers, I feel qualified to render an opinion on this book written by the doctor who spanned several expeditions in his own attempt to summit (so far he hasn't made it). I was all set to find it pretentious and egocentric, but to my surprise it was thoroughly enjoyable with not a trace of ego. This is no mean feat for someone who specializes in microscopic hand surgery and gives up several months out of the year to pursue his hobby. In addition to being a great help to many teams of climbers, he provides very vivid accounts of his own attempts to reach the summit. I would rate this just behind Into Thin Air -- a high compliment. Plus, I loved the everyday details like the fact that he used sanitary napkins to keep his underwear clean. By the time we reach the famous IMAX/Everest expedition we are able to see this trip in the context of several climbing seasons. The author is blessed with a supportive family that tolerated his long absences each season. All in all, a rousing read with lots of suspense along the way. Also more personal than most of the other Everest accounts with a &quot;you are there&quot; feeling to it.

I wanted to love this CD but so far after a few listens, I only like it. I don't think it's fair to say that this album is worse than previous ones -- rather I think it's more complex and takes time to appreciate. There are some great songs, but even the best don't match up to his classics from earlier albums. So overall as an album this one may be better, but it lacks the incredibly catchy and memorable tracks from earlier ones. I have one small gripe -- can't Marc afford a more audiophile label? The sonics are mediocre to bad on this CD. Way too bright, way to pop in terms of recording -- I'd like to hear Marc's liquid voice with a tubed recording. He deserves it.

Okay, this isn't an astronomy textbook, but in a quick and easy to read volume, Gardner provides some clear explanations of some interesting puzzle like questions. No previous knowledge is assumed, so the book will be a bit easy for the serious astronomer, but I don't believe that's whom the book is intended for. In fact, I'd recommend buying it for an interested middle schooler or high school student to stimulate their interest int he solar system. Very entertaining, quick and easy to read with some complicated problems explained.

I loved this book so much that I want to jot down my thoughts again. You'll find it hard to believe that this novel is the author's first work. She writes with an assured style and invents a highly original plot line involving among other things a whore house to please women (no intercourse is the rule!), a life changing rape that renders the protagonist mute, a repentent soldier and some great side characters.By now you should get the idea -- the author combines great writing with an intiguing plot to create one of the most memorable novels I've read this year. There are elements of Toni Morrison, magic realism, a dash of Faulkner -- she is one to watch out for. In short, I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this terrific first novel by a talented writer. I can't wait for her next one.

I've loved all of Baker's books so far (from the wild and crazy Vox and Fermata to his more staid literary forays), so it says a lot to say that this is his best yet, or at least his most important. You don't have to be a librarian to understand the ridiculous argument about testing the durability of a book by folding and refolding a page until it breaks. For decades librarians and others working in librarys have used the most lame tests possible, all to justify tossing originals (books and newspapers) and replacing them with microfilm. I'm all for electronic material and microfilm which definitely speeds up research, but there are times when only a hard copy will do as anyone who does serious research can tell you. I can't tell you how often as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College (which has a great library) I would try to locate books by using the electronic catalog only to find that 90% of what I ultimately found helpful came from browsing directly in the stacks. It is impossible to find everything electronically due to scanning errors, typos, etc... as Baker makes clear. I can also tell you how frustrating my graduate years at Columbia University were -- yes the library was bigger but many books were missing. After reading Baker's tome, I know where they are!Baker's work is thoroughly researched, passionately argued, a joy to read and an important book for everyone who loves books to read. What has been happening with books is a crime. Baker backs up his words with action by taking major steps to buy collections and store them. As he points out, you can fit decades worth of bound newspapers in a small part of the Toys R Us aisle!

It's been over 20 years since I've had any physics, but I still enjoyed the riddles and questions in this book -- sure, some were over my head, but I still could understand lots of the explanations. Plus, the examples are practical enough to make you the star of your next party: is it better (which will make it COOL faster) to let black coffee cool first and then put in cold milk or to put cold milk in and let it cool? Coffee drinkers will be happy to know that black coffee cools faster than white so wait a few minutes before pouring your cold milk in if you want it to cool quickly. If you like these kinds of brainteasers, you'll love this book. An appropriate gift for students and pondering adults alike. The authors also provide interesting quotes in the margins that make for good reading as well. Some of the explanations are a bit too brief if you really want to understand the physics behind it, but the authors provide the reader with enough information to dig deeper. Fun!

For the budget price and 2 CD's packed with these four great symphonies and two shorter works, you can't go wrong. I think von Karajan is the way to go for Sibelius, and these are certainly excellent recordings. I'm not an expert in Sibelius' music, but after one or two listening sessions, I can tell you that the music is beautiful. Though the recording is ADD, the quality is quite strong. I try to buy DDD when I can, but there is no obvious weakness to the sound on these CD's. I even like the CD design which recreates the album look of the original DG recordings. All in all, a great combination, lots of music and a fair price. Did I mention a great performance by the most legendary Sibelius conductor and the Berlin Philharmonic? Give it a listen.

Thanks to my coursework, I'm reading lots of books on leadership. I just finished this one which I'd rate the most helpful in terms of hands-on leadership of all the ones I've read so far (about 10). The style is easy to read and quick, and the points very direct, well-explained and easy to follow. Not only that, the content is CRUCIAL for any leader. It's only too easy to see from the examples they give how many seemingly easy things (like remembering to thank your co-workers and recognize their accomplishments) are NOT followed by current leaders. In case you every wondered to yourself, &quot;But how would I do that?&quot; enough examples are provided (very specific ones) that any leader could manage it if they WANTED to. What I liked about this book is that it recognized many facets of leadership that have been ignored like leading with your heart and not asking others to do what you yourself would not. It's not about having the nicest office -- it's about getting out on the factory floor and talking to those you lead. A terrific book both in theory and content. If you only read one, read this one.

I was turned on to Ella Maillart after stumbling accidentally onto her obituary in the New York Times. Her life was so interesting that I went to the library and read all of her books -- she is now one of my heroes. This was a woman who was years ahead of her time. She makes the North Pole explorers look like creampuffs. Hers are some of the most incredible travelogues you will ever come across, and are all the more amazing considering that she was the first true female explorer. Some kind publisher should reissue a collection of her best work. A winner and worth seeking out.

Some reviewers may not have liked Gordon personally (a bit self-absorbed, seems to bail on his daughters, runs off with his friend's wife...), but they shouldn't hold that against his tale. The story of his ill-fated trip is more of a memoir than an adventure. I'm not sure how a critic could say the story was not convincing -- it's real and very affecting. I don't want to give away the plot, but this is a wrenching tale. How many times have we thought, &quot;If I'd only done x, y or z...&quot; Gordon rakes himself over the coals over and over again, but nothing can bring back the past. I thought he was brave to write of his own personal suffering, even if you don't happen to side with him. I agree that the writing wasn't as good as the very best, but it was exciting and detailed and very solid. Okay, not literary, but respectable enough for its genre. Overall, if you like a bit of the personal mixed in with adventure, you will appreciate this book although remember it is difficult in parts because of the tragedy. Overall, it was an absorbing read.

I was amazed at first that this book was written by a non-professional, but after reading it, I can see that the author went through much of this stuff personally and learned a great deal. Lawyers only tell you so much, but this book examines the issues from various sides. It is VERY comprehensive. You can read it cover to cover (it's very absorbing) or use the exellent indices to find almost any topic you need to know. Some of hte material (like the detective reports) is fascinating. There is a ton of helpful advice. The only problem with the book is that it's SO big that it can seem overwhelming until you realize that you don't have to read everything, just what's relevant. I like the fact that the author emphasizes that you should do everything NOT to fight in order to protect your kids. Many feel a custody battle is about who wins and who loses, but the biggest losers tend to be the children.

I've had to read many learning organizational books for my graduate studies -- this was one of my favorites out of maybe 10 I've read. One, it's fun to read! The examples are erudite, taken from other disciplines like science and math, not just business. The 10 steps are easy to follow, logical and well represented. The authors rely on concrete examples that everyone can relate to. If I had to train a group of people or point an organization towards achieving its goals as a learning organization, I would rely on this book as my bible. Great writing style, great examples -- overall one of the most enjoyable I've read!

After always reading books from the perspective of male desire, it's nice to find an author who unabashedly shows us the perspective of female desire. As the book opens, the narrator leaves her husband in search of adventure and sexual prey. Soon, she finds herself hanging out at a diving bar getting to know the various cast of characters and sleeping with all of them, including the mysterious Enzo. Each has their distinct drawbacks, including Enzo who is a dangerous character. Still, she seeks the thrill of diving, mindblowing passion and weightlifting (with steroids) while her life ironically starts to fall apart. This book is a quick read, and one that will leave you breathless. At the end, we can only imagine that like the phoenix, Ramona will rise again, maybe even get her act together for a more balanced life.

This is much more than your run of the mill love story because if its intensity and strong writing. We travel seamlessly between Paris and Russia as the narrative switches from the narrator's current train ride to his older love affair with the beautiful Anna. His memory starts when he spies someone on the train making one of Anna's most intimate gestures, but he cannot find her. This sighting starts him on his personal quest both to finish the film he's working on and to come to a sense of closure in this relationship.Though the plot is fairly straightforward, the author brings us to more profound levels of emotion through the characters' interactions and love story. Though it's a quick read, it's not a simple read and there are some breathtaking scenes that will stay with you long after the close of the novel. The ending felt a bit too cinematic, but I overall I really enjoyed this book. His 1991 book Separation won the Prix Renaudot, so I plan on finding that one next.

I was kind of surprised how much others seemed to have HATED this book. I admit, it's not a &quot;serious&quot; or deep novel, but I did find it charming and laughed out loud on at least 10 seprate occasions. Sure, there are some gaps in the plot (but it's not a really plot driven book) like what ever was the conductor's wife doing anyway?) but the scenes were just, well, funny and charming in their own way. Yes there are stereotypes, but they make us laugh at ourselves and our own habits, not at librarians in general. I think it's silly for librarians to be up in arms when the character is so likable. She's the first to admit how silly some of her habits and emotional disabilities are. It comes down to this -- if you want a light book of fiction that will make you laugh and has a happy ending, this is a terrific and downright fun book. If you're looking for the next Ulysses, well this isn't it. I bet none of the librarian critics caught the sly reference to Yeats' poem the Lake Isle of Innisfree -- come to think of it, maybe they didn't get lots of subtle wit and humor.

Although I enjoyed the usual snide tone of this dummies book, my major complaint is that it never gets beyond the dummy level. I read the whole book in one sitting -- now I'm hardly a computer genius and have only had Windows 2000 for a week, but I only learned THREE new tricks from this entire book! I never thought of myself as a computer jock, but this book had such basics that I began to feel like a true nerd. There are other major things I wanted to learn about windows 2000: why does it make my passwords look 3 times their normal size? Is that some kind of encoding thing? I'm sure there are other aspects to learn besides 3 ways to copy a folder or file. Unless you haven't spent any time at all with Windows (any edition), you probably won't learn all that much from this very basic book.

Let me preface this by saying that I'm about as &quot;non-techie&quot; as it gets, and I still found this book extremely readable and interesting. Rippy is an acknowledged expert in the field of tech. start ups and takes both the experienced and the lay business person on a step by step process of the birth (and sometimes death)of these burgeoning companies. Sure, there is always the chance that your IPO will make you a billionaire, but Rippy makes it clear that in more than 90% of all start ups, that is usually far from the case. He does not try to discourage anyone from entering the field, but he does provide realistic tools and methods for evaluating a company's viability at every differrent stage. Like children, these tech. start ups have an organizational birth stage, adolescence, adulthood and death. If you understand the financial implications at every phase, you will be much better equipped to make a decision in this tremendous marketplace. Even for people like me who are just small business oriented, this book provides dozens of insights into the business world, stocks, IPO's, that go beyond the scope of start up companies. In order to keep up with the technological revolution, this book should be required reading for anyone with even an eye towards the business world. The chapters on venture capitalists and the companies they fund make for particularly interesting reading. Mr. Rippy's engaging and knowledgeable style throughout make this book a winner.

This is a business book for an English major! No really, if you like to think metaphorically, you will enjoy this book because it gives several models for understanding organizations. The organization as an organism, as a brain, as a physic prison, etc....At the end of each chapter, the author summarizes and then states the limitations and advantages of each metaphor. The final chapters are devoted to applying these approaches to real examples. As far as business books go, I found this one very interesting and more holistic than most. Maybe that's because I was an English major.

Despite the juicy plot summary and book jacket, this book is not very special. If you want a really good Cuban book, try The Lonely Crossing of Juan Cabrera, a real classic. This book aspires to greatness but does little more than catch a bit of the mood of Cuba of a different era. The relationships are not well developed, the plot is a mish-mash of convoluted events and the writing is uneven. I'm not trying to pick on the author, but for the big hardcover release this book has, one would expect it be have some more literary qualities. The writing is mediocre at best. Even an interesting relationship like the one with the narrator's friend Paula is not well developed. An okay first effort, but she has a ways to go before reaching her groove.

I just bought two high quality lenses for my Digital Rebel and what a difference this makes over the kit lens which I wish I hadn't bought. I bought this one mostly for indoor and outdoor portraits of my kids and dogs. It is just amazing! I was surprised by how much difference a good lens can make. I've been playing around and I took tons of shots of my kids today and the portraits are amazingly clear with GREAT background blur -- I feel like a pro. If you use the aperature priority setting and play around, you'll see that you too can make professional level background blur even if you barely know what you are doing (this would be me). In short, invest in a good lens. Don't forget to multiply the focal length by 1.6 if you have a digital canon camera -- 85 mm is really 135mm or so, really a telephoto type lens. Great for portraits!

I am sick of explaining to novices that baseball is not boring. You'd think it would be obvious that anything that you don't know something about can be boring, but the more you know, the more interesting it becomes. Surely baseball is much the same. As a longtime baseball fan an avid softball/baseball player, I can't think of a sports book I enjoyed more. This is the thinking person's view of two baseball games. Did you ever think that every single count (2-2, 3-2 etc...) implies a whole new field of possiblities for batter, pitcher and fielders? No one will make you appreciate the art and the intellectual side of baseball like Hernandez (no relation -- get a grip!) Rather than trying to explain your love of baseball next time, buy a skeptic this book or better yet, read it yourself. Even a pro would learn a lot from this pitch by pitch account.

Okay, credit to the author for a novel idea and a cute storyline that tries to make believers out of all of us. In the tradition of Richard Evans and other simple-plot writers, this is a neat little love story with a Christmas theme. I read it in about an hour and found the story charming. On the other hand, the writing is mundane, the characters' thoughts spelled out to the nth degree (she wanted to kiss him, he wanted to see her...) to the point that it almost took the magic out of the story. At times it felt like a poor version of writer's workshop. Still, the story has merit and I don't think the author aspired to great literary heights -- I apologize if I'm being too harsh, but the writing just wasn't as good as the idea. If you want a quick read and an inspiring love story, you won't regret it, but if you're looking for literature, you have the wrong book.

I'm surprised how many really did NOT like his stories. It seems that after reading his novel, they wanted greater things from these early short stories. I found lots of promise in these short stories with much of the subtle style that he uses later in Snow Falling. The strongest stories in the collection involve young boys growing up in the Northwest. Although the action is lots of hunting and fishing, there is a major undercurrent of emotional tension and frustration. In some ways, these remind me of some of Hemingway's early stories, not so much in terms of style, but setting. The Hunters, for instance, brought back images of Hemingway's The Battler. If I could have given this collection 3 1/2 stars, I would have, but it's just short of 4. Still, I enjoyed almost every story in the collection. Guterson is a &quot;show&quot; not tell type of writer, so I suspect some readers weren't watching closely enough. There's beauty and depth in some of these stories.

For those who are expecting dance music, this is definitely not your CD. The Billie Holiday comparision is apt in some ways: this is melancholy music, not your high charged son montuno or salsa. If you are looking for that type of music, go for some of the other BVSC discs. Some of these tracks are incredible -- and you don't have to listen to Ry Cooder's grating slide on every track. My personal favorite is &quot;no me llores mas.&quot; This disc brougth back memories of one of my favorite singers of this type of mellow-er music: Esther Borja. Her CD's are out of print (many of them), but Portuondo sings many of the same songs that Borja sang, but with a much huskier voice. If you enjoy the more ballad-like side of Cuban music, you will not be able to get enough of this CD.

My only complaint about this book is that it needed more maps -- the author includes three or four maps at the beginning, but since there are no others, you'll find yourself constantly flipping back to find out exactly where in the artic you are wintering or where in the Sahara you are starving to death. I must be on a masochistic streak because I had just finished the story of the Essex whaling ship which ended in disaster (with the men resorting to cannibalism), and now I pick up another book where there are many horrible deaths. Still, this is absorbing both as history and as adventure writing. Ferguson starts out by giving us historical background about the English empire and why in the early 19th century it was important to find the Northwest passage and to have England map out as many remote parts of the globe as possible. I found this fascinating reading, mostly because unlike most books which focus on successes, this one shows which expeditions succeeded, but also which ones failed miserably. The chapters alternate between frigid artic explorations and boiling desert tales. Just when you think to yourself, &quot;Oh, I'd never want to die of the cold,&quot; then you get to Africa and read about the horrible deaths by yellow fever or be sabre (those nasty Tuaregs) and you think that the cold sounds like a great way to die. It's hard to believe all the screw ups, bad provisioning and downright stupid things that explorers did to find new land. Ultimately, it does seem like bad planning if you are forced to eat your boots, as is one heroic explorer in a disastrous adventure. All in all, you won't be able to put this book down. It's well written and engrossing.

This book is not an easy read, but it's a worthwhile one. Gribbins is a good writer and does an excellent job getting the reader up to speed on modern physics by taking a whirlwind tour of 20th century discoveries. Every once in a while, he'd lose me, but then I'd catch up. If you're in the mood for an excellent scientific lesson, you won't be disappointed. For the record I found Hawking a more lucid science writer, but Gribbin is still quite good.

I agree with the reviewer below who points out that this collection, especially the title essay, is a great companion for reading The Stranger. My AP English students loved The Stranger, but they got a much clearer idea of what Camus' brand of existentialism was after reading this essay. It sounds like a bizarre concept, but Camus regarded Sisyphus as a hero because every single time he toiled to push the rock up the mountain, there is one brief moment when he reaches the top that he is CONSCIOUS of his task, and in this brief glance downwards, Camus feels that Sisyphus experiences a small degree of something close to hope. This realization defeats the gods who sentenced him because he finds consolation in his struggle. For Camus, it is the struggle that must occupy us. The difference between Sisyphus and a factory worker is that Sisyphus experiences the freedom to think and process what he doing. For Camus, this level of consciousness can free any of us from our everyday lives.This collection is a must to get a better understanding of The Stranger and other Camus novels and ideas.

No one would call Cussler's work great literature, but even we literary snobs need our &quot;trash&quot; reading and for that, Cussler has been my favorite author since Raise the Titanic and Night Probe. Sometimes the dialogue is cheesy and the overuse of adjectives makes you laugh out loud, but to leave it at that would miss the point -- these books are action adventures, so mellow out! Although I liked Kurt and Joe, I miss my old friend Dirk Pitt (and good old Al). The two heros in the new series are so similar that I'm surprised he bothered to introduce new characters. Switch a hobby here and there (dueling pistols for antique cars) and change hair and eye color, and voila, Dirk becomes Kurt.As for the plot, the opening chapters are, as usual, riveting as we watch the horrifying crash of the Andrea Doria. It's a formula that has worked in many other Cussler books. This one pulls all the regular punches and will hold most readers' attention although the plot flags here and there (I too think too many switch offs between Cussler and his co-author). I found the end a bit too tidy -- the excitement wears off around the 2nd two thirds of the novel. Still, for NUMA fans, a worthwhile read which will keep you up at night turning pages.

I've loved my Elf 1 for about 3 years now and just bought the Elf 2 for my parents (although they may get my old one -- they don't know that yet!). After having spent some time with it, I like the new one a bit better because of the neat new features: 1 -- you can change film midroll which is neat if you want to shoot different film for different conditions 2 -- If you know you just took a great shot, you can specify how many prints you want made up to 9! I wish mine had that feature. You can also use it for the following shot, but that's it. 3 -- the flash doesn't stick up any more so it can't get stuck 4 -- it has a new zoom device which works better and is more convenient. Plus, it takes the same great pictures in 3 modes that the old Elf did. I agree that Panormanic shoots of far off mountains are better with an SLR, but almost every other kind of shot looks just fine with the Elf. It's amazing how camera quality this good can be had for such a price. For proud parents -- the best part of the Elf is that it's TINY and you can keep it in your purse. I've taken zillions of rolls whereas with my older bigger camera, I never took it with me. You don't have to give up much to get this great quality. Wait no more!

This book is fun for the first few pages, but then it fizzles. The writing is too clever for its own good, you don't care much about any of the characters and the plot is non-existent. There are SO many chick lit books that manage to be charming and entertaining, so this one is a failure by comparison. I'm not trying to compare it to great literature, but even within it's own somewhat trashy genre, it is remarkably undistinguished. I'm not sure what even kept me going except the drive to finish the darn thing and never have to see it again. Even the so-called sex scenes were a snore.

I've read dozens of Holocaust testimonials, but this collection is certainly one of the most gripping. Though they are survivor tales, they do not make for light reading (they do make for important reading). I'm still haunted by one story in particular about a young boy who escapes being buried alive -- I challenge you to read this book and not be plagued by the image of his teacher, Jablonski. The author does a fabulous job of culling together incredible stories of how dumb luck, random chance or connections play a role in saving people from unspeakable evil. An important collection that should not be missed.

I'm on a quest to find all of Carroll's books -- he's the most amazing writer I know. I had never read this one and was lucky enough to find a copy. Like he does in all his books, he does a great job creating funky characters, wild plots and exotic settings (or at least Vienna and Venice). I like the premise of the book: that death can take the form of anyone you know and if he likes you, you die well, but if he doesn't, you suffer. As usual, Carroll makes you really think about your own life and consider deeper issues. There are some bone chilling scenes when one of the characters realizes that the love of her life is just death playing a role to lure her in. It creeped me out for hours. As I'd say with any Carroll book, find it and read it. This book was a bit rougher than some of his novels -- he tries to hold together 3 strands of plot that sometimes seem like they will fall apart, but ultimately, he does manage to tie them all together. A minor complaint though. It's not his very best, but it's still damn good.

I went in search of Vives' disks after realizing that he was the singer of La Gota Fria (which apparently is no longer available). I'm a big fan of Cuban music, and I'm just getting into some Columbian. Though I liked a few of these songs, they are too &quot;pop&quot; for my tastes. Some even bordered on the cheesy. I don't mean anything against Vives since his other disks have been better, but I really am not very fond of this CD.

Sure, you could criticize this book, as many have, for being a light read or shallow. I think they miss the emotional point which Berg nails right on the head: there are so many devastatingly moving scenes involving her son Travis, her feelings of insecurity and her emotional recovery that this turned out to be one of the best reads of the year. She reminds me in some ways of Raymond Carver because she capitalizes on these very personal moments. If you read beyond the &quot;shallow&quot; prose, you'll find deep thoughts and emotions, lots of humor, and lots of very true to life scenes. The minor characters were all quite well drawn too -- King will stay with you for a while. I suspect women will enjoy this book more than men, but after you read it, you may see why.

If this book had Stephen King's name instead of Charles Gaines, it would have sold a million plus copies. I haven't read a thriller this engaging in quite awhile. Since I spent a good deal of time around the New Hampshire area he writes about, I enjoyed it even more. On the surface, this novel is a suspense thriller, but farther down, it has a lot to say about couples, friendships and relationships. Red Sizemore is one sick character, but we understand why he is the way he is from Gaines' characterization. The author spends more time on Bill and Claire than he does on Dray and Portia, but I don't think that detracts in any way from the book. Survival becomes the central point of the book as the two male characters made their fortune by starting a survival games company years before the book opens. When two men kidnap their wives, they have to call upon these wilderness skills to get them back. While a bit gory in parts, the stalking parts of the book are fascinating. I can't believe this was not made into a movie -- it would be easy to capture on film. A thoroughly enjoying read from cover to cover.

I'll lay my cards on the time straight away to say that I really enjoyed O'Reilly's first book and watch his program on a regular basis. He's one of the few (maybe only!) reporters who's not afraid to throw himself under the bus to defend an issue or to expose the truth. Despite harsh criticism he endures, I find that he's neither right nor left wing -- he just wants accountability and answers. If that makes him sound arrogant to some, I say it's a small price to pay for uncovering all the hypocrisy and scandals in our country. Someone has to search for the truth.With that being said, this book was not much of an effort. I read it in under and hour and I doubt it took him more than a short time to write it. It gives every appearance of being hastily written, relying mostly on interviews and less so on enlightening commentary. I did love the Hillary Clinton fantasy, his no-spin life theory and some of the interviews (the Dan Rather story is classic), but I wanted more substance, more depth, and more O'Reilly. The first book was much more detailed and anecdotal, more about his life, his beliefs, the issues -- this one is bathroom reading, albeit entertaining bathroom reading. I give him 3 stars for a less than stellar effort on the book (your fans want more!) but 5 stars for just being O'Reilly, hard nosed reporter. That's how I arrived at 4 overall. Read it for yourself.

First off, I'm one of Murakami's biggest fans and every since Hard Boiled Wonderland have been a devotee. By now it should be obvious that this non-fiction is totally unlike anything he's written so far. It's not a fanciful novel (a la Wind up Bird Chronicle) nor a riveting short story collection (Elephant Vanishes), but rather a penetrating look at the modern Japanese psyche. As fans of Murakami know, he exiled himself from Japan for several years while he lived in Europe and the U.S. This wider perspective makes his insights into Japanese society even more interesting.I admit that I was just starting to get tired of reading the first half of the book which consists of first person retellings of their encounter with the deadly gas Sarin. But, there IS a point to all this -- it has the overall effect of an &quot;everyman&quot; trauma, almost Joycean in scope that can't be captured from a mere report or media take. Then, Murakami turns to his own thoughts and his interviews of Aum followers which is particularly interesting. In the end, I found this fascinating, but I do prefer his novels. Still, I applaud him for taking a risk and venturing outside his usual narrative space. Viva Murakami!

This is my first experience with this series, and what a positive experience it was! The layout is very easy to follow, the diagrams are accurate and attractive, and the text clear. I barely knew how to use Excel at all when I started, but after under 3 hours with the book, I'm confident that I could do any major project just using the information I learned while reading it. Kudos to whoever designed the order of difficulty and chapter headings, because the progression of ideas naturally follows. The chapters on using complex formulas and creating charts were particularly strong. In fact, even if you don't know how to use your mouse, if you read the book chronologically, you'd learn that too, followed by of course more complex things. I knew Excel was a powerful program. After reading this book, I feel that I can put that knowledge to work in practical ways. If you are a visual learner and have trouble following the &quot;Idiot Guides,&quot; this series is a great alternative.

If you've read any of my other reviews of Carroll's books, you'll know I'm a bit of a groupie, so I may have liked these stories more than most. Sure, not every story was perfect, but Carroll is so creative and so bizarre that I could not put this book down. Since I had just finished A Child Across the Sky, I had read two of the stories already as they are contained in that novel. Furthermore, Black Cocktail is published in a separate volume. That still leaves a good 17 stories or so that are &quot;new&quot; and I loved all of them. I think he's better at novels, but I enjoy his stories because he is able to isolate one or two wild ideas into a coherent story rather than jumbling them all together in a novel where they don't always make sense. For some reason, I really liked the &quot;Zoondel&quot; story about a special breed of dog that recognizes werewolves. If you're a Carroll fan, you'll definitely want to see how he translates some of his shorter ideas into short stories.

I don't think it will shock many readers that Americans are at least one or two hours sleep deprived a night -- the author details dozens of horrifying accidents and incidents that resulted from the actions of sleep deprived individuals. The opening few chapters about the various levels of sleep made for great reading. The twenty tips for good sleep were helpful, although most of them I already knew. In short, there is nothing extremely new or cutting edge, but there is lots of usable and easy to read information about all kinds of sleep disorders. I found it very entertaining and well presented although I would have cut out some of the extra stuff.

For anyone who loves the Iliad or aspires to immerse himself in great literature, this new book by classicist James Tatum is inspiring. This is the first of his books to leave classic Greece and Rome (and its corresponding literature) to explore classical themes right up through the present with an emphasis on Vietnam. His writing is crystal clear and his range and knowledge of modern and ancient poetry and literature shines through on every page. Therefore, the alert reader will learn much more than how relevant the Iliad is throughout the ages as a book of force, war and remembrance -- namely how a poem like the Iliad can illuminate all modern conflicts and how we memorialize these conflicts as well. I particularly enjoyed the introductory chapter that discussed the differences in various translations (Fagles, Lattimore and older versions like Alexander Pope's) explaining the subtleties of each. Rather than quoting from only one, he carefully alternates throughout the book to give each translator a chance to stand out in his own particular speciality. It was a pleasant surprise to be reminded of Pope's linguistically intricate translation that still stands as a modern masterpiece.In short, any lover of the classics should savor this book since The Iliad has been Tatum's focus for many years as an Ivy league professor. You can't do any better unless you travel to Dartmouth and sit it on his ever popular and chronically oversubscribed classes.

This short manual of pistol shooting includes many pointers that would serve the novice as well as the expert shooter. For me, the most helpful chapters were the first three that focus on proper stance, grip, breathing and sight picture. Shooting is somewhat of a zen experience in that you need to put together lots of different parts into a coherent whole. It helps to break down the process into each component in order to analyze what you may be doing wrong. If you start with proper technique, it is much easier to correct problems down the road. That is why the opening chapters are so important to study. Once an improper technique is learned, it is very difficult to unlearn it. Many shooters never properly learn how to make an accurate sight picture. Though the pictures in the book are somewhat outdated in terms of style, they are current for technique. If you can ignore the flared pants and 70's outfits, you'll have no problem figuring the proper technique.The second half of the book is devoted to different types of competitions with helpful tips for every one. Obviously you can't use the exact technique for rapid firing shooting as for slow fire shooting. The book is written for a British audience, but the author includes all the major American and NRA competitions as well. Very helpful overall and well done.

I picked this book up at an airport store and then got so absorbed that the plane could have gone down and I'd still be reading to find out what became of Lily and the incredible surrogate family she finds in the bee keepers house. I was worried that the bee keeping theme would become too cliched, but the author manages the metaphor perfectly without overdoing it at all. The portraits of the south are so vivid that the book does evoke such classics at To Kill a Mockingbird -- in fact, Lily is just as scrappy and recourcefull as Scout. Unlike TKAM, there are few male heroes -- this is a book about women and their mothering capability. The writing is lyric throughout and the portrayal of the south spot on. It's hard to believe this is Kidd's first novel as she writes with an aura of experience that is hard to fabricate. An excellent read.

The author does such an excellent job recreating a southern black women balancing her 5 kids, tyranical husband and a host of misfortunes that you'll find it hard to believe that it's a HE. Strong praise then to Mr. Jackson who does a superb job recreating the trials and tribulations of a southern family. No one will accuse of him of taking the man's side. His writing is very mature -- although I wasn't crazy about the gimmick of the narrative coming from the unborn child, it doesn't interfere with the great writing, dialogue and story telling. My ONLY small criticicm is that I didn't think the friendship with Ida was well drawn enough to convince us fully of its strength and duration. That aside, it's one terrific novel -- you'll be standing up and cheering by the end.

I found out about this book the year it came out thanks to the fact that it was nominated by an obscure British group as one of the top 25 works of literature of all time. That might be somewhat of an overstatement, but it's a very profound little book that no book lover should miss. Even my high school students, although at first they think it's weird that a housewife would fall in love with a green monster, saw its poignancy and beautiful prose. Ingalls is one of my favorite writers of all time.

If you have not ever listened to an &quot;MA recording,&quot; you should immediately send for their catalogue and order all the CD's in genres that interest you. The recordings are the most audiophile I have heard. I have all their Spanish medieval recordings and each one is better than the next. My favorite is Calamus: The Music of Al-Andalus, followed by this one. Some of the songs are even repeated, but this time on the psalter, no voices. I have it playing as I write this and encourage any serious music fans to track all these recordings down -- you won't regret it. By the way, they are beautifully packaged as well with great covers, illustrations of the medieval instruments and thorough notes.

It wasn't just the sheer number of Chinese killed by the Japanese, it was the cruel way many were lit on fire, pierced, disembowled, speared, hacked, etc... with total abandon. The first few chapters are enough to sicken even those up on their Holocaust literature. Just when you thought man's inhumanity to man couldn't be worse than it was under Hitler, we back up a few years to 1937 and realize that cruelty has been around forever. The book would be even more depressing if Chang hadn't decided to focus also on some of the heros who saved hundreds sometimes thousands of Chinese from death and disfigurement. Although I knew of the rape of Nanking, I had no idea the depth and scope of the slaughter. Chang could have been more objective, but after reading the book, it is hard to say anything positive about the Japanese behavior. In another great book, 3 Daughters of China, it's clear that the Chinese had their share of poor behavior as well with the Japanese, but as far as scale, the Rape of Nanking takes the cake. A tough read content-wise, but an important study.

Though I enjoyed reading this book because it was light and entertaining, it's not Proust. In fact, it's not even tremendously insightful about parenthood. There are some funny stories (for my money, the funniest pages had to do with Al's description of using the blue rubber bulb snot sucker to clean his baby's nose. He calls her his little mucus machine), but overall, the writing is too chatty and the editing weak. For example, he recounts at length early in the book how is slipped on a softball and managed to do heavy damage to his face. Then, many chapters later, he repeats the incident with no memory of having brought it up before. Just like the example another review cites when he reintroduces characters that have been introduced already. A major release book like this could have been edited much better -- it feels rushed.Still, Roker is genial and sincere, which makes the book impossible to dislike. He shares his family history, his Bahamian background and we learn that he really is a genial guy. But I knew that before I read the book. Where the book succeeds, it's cute, but don't expect it to be profound.

I read this book in one long sitting which speaks to how fluid the writing and how absorbing the material is. Amazing to think that a poor French boy who hated math managed to excel in Latin, Greek, Aramaic and several other ancient languages before his 13th birthday. The opening chapters on the savants in Egypt during Napoleon's occupation there were as fascinating as Champllion's life and his dedication to figuring out hieroglypics. I cannot but be amazed at the political infighting and backstabbing that took place -- I guess the times haven't changed much since then. As another reviewer points out, my only small criticism is that I wanted to know more about the mechanics of Champollion's method in solving the riddle -- the authors allude to it many times without being specific enough to help the novice figure out what exactly his breakthrough was. Nonetheless, an excellent read about the time period, Champollion himself and his brother who helped him every step of the way.

We always say how important education is to us, but often times we fall down on the job as parents and community members by not following up. The author of this book arms parents with enough concrete information (and sources to find even more information) to evaluate schools. Though she focuses on public schools, much of the information would be applicable to private schools too. I thought she was spot on in her descriptions of good and bad principals as well as good/bad teachers. In short, as educators, we need to be accountable -- enough of throwing up our hands. It's time to realize that we are behind other countries, especially in math, and it's time to adopt strong standards, not fuzzy ones. Occassionally, the author overstates or overgeneralizes (or perhaps is just overopinionated), but I see that as a relatively small flaw in a very useful and pragmatic book. She did a good job on the annotated bibliography and web site description.

I've been addicted to the adventure/disaster genre, but this is one of the best I've read. Like the Perfect Storm, the author delves into all the details of starving to death, drowning and thirst that make such thrilling reading. Though I was getting a bit light-headed when they started eating leather, I made it through without even eating a snack. The details are what make this book so gripping -- you'll feel like you know them all and that you're in the boat with them. And when they miss islands that looked like they existed but didn't, your heart will break alongside the men's. It's interesting to note that most of the men really couldn't go on to live normal lives after this mishap, but after you're done reading, it won't be hard to see why!

Once you read Douglass's narrative, you will be surprised that Douglass learned enough to be able to write the first narrative written by an uneducated slave. This is one of the most moving narratives you can read -- I challenge any reader to read this and not understand the irony of the white people supressing black people's accomplishments for hundreds of years. The story of Fredrick Douglas in inspiring on many different levels. Once you read it, any reader will understand why this is mandatory reading in any American literature course. It is impossible to understand life after the Civil War without reading this moving, touching novel about how a slave learned how to read and write. Douglass's autobiography is a great literary achievement which should be savored by all who read it both as a historical and literary document.

I did not read the Mass Market version, but rather the Montcrieff translation in two volumes. The first volume traces Julian's rise from a poor carpenter's son (beaten by his brothers) to a Latin tutor to the town's mayor. Then we follow his love affair with the mayor's wife. Through it all, at least we see the sincerity and real love he feels both for M. Renal and her children (actually, they seem more fond of him than vice-versa).The second volume leaves the provinces and takes place mostly in Paris -- all but the most diehard will probably find the middle of volume two slow going in parts -- Matilde is simply not as interesting as Madame Renal and the political and church intrigues are simply hard for anyone in our time to follow. The last 100 or so pages pick up again and things get interesting. If you can stick out volume two, you'll be glad that you did. The details of day to day life are amazing and painstakingly plotted. The plot seems to take a while to unfold, but that does not take away this novel's place as one of the great 19th century classics. Except for some slow stretches in volume two, it was a great read.

This is NOT an autobiographical essay, although you might suppose so after the opening story of his exile to California and then later back to Mexico where he was treated as a stranger. This episode serves more as a kernel from which grows his political and social education and experience. Paz briefly traces his political growth from childhood to maturity, through Mexico, the Yucatan (which he points out is so very different from the rest of Mexico), Paris, Spain, India, etc... The editor does his best to provide background history, but be warned that Paz assumes you have the same strong knowledge of Mexican history that he does. I though the highlight was his piercing conclusion about the evil in ourselves, &quot;Evil is human, exclusively human. But not all is evil in humans. Evil nests in their awareness, in their freedom. In there also lies the remedy, the answer to evil... to fight evil is to fight ourselves. And that is the meaning of history.&quot;The writing is clear throughout -- Paz writes well in prose form as well as poetry. A bit hard to follow sometimes, but aren't all intellectual journeys?

I'm somewhat of a Cuban music addict -- even after only listening to this CD twice, I can say without a doubt that it's one of the best releases of the last few years. I loved Sublime Ilusion -- this is rustic, campesino music with exquisite tres playing and great vocals by Ochoa. There's not a bad song on this disc. Most of the songs are son with a few boleros and bolero son thrown in. The documentation is excellent with translations of all the songs included. Whether your a veteran collector of classic Cuban music or a newcomer, you'll enjoy this CD. If you like it, try Sublime Ilusion too.

After reading all the other reviews below, I have to say I enjoyed the novella much more than they did. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if the system let me. Okay, it's not as substantial as Bellow's most famous novels, but he's such an observant writer with such a good sense of nuance, that I enjoyed the experience of reading it. His characterization of the aging but powerful billionaire Harry Adletsky makes us feel that we've known him all our lives. With just a few pencil strokes, Bellow brings to life an odd cast of characters who draw us into their odd world. On the surface it's a love story, but beneath, Bellow opens up worlds of social circles and offbeat human interactions that make this such an interesting read. I imagine that what Bellow likes best about the novella form is that it allows him to draw his plot and characters with just a few strokes while challenging him to make them life-like. I think he succeeds admirably.

I appreciate all my fellow reviewer's criticisms about the book: yes it's true that Bloom was opinionated, non-politically correct, and a bit of a wacko at times. Still, he's one of the few 20th century critics who has the self confidence not to fall into lit. crit. jargon to express himself -- he manages to avoid the snobbiness that often accompanies Shakespeare studies. The word I would use to describe this work overall is uneven. Some chapters are so insightful that you may ask yourself how you could have ever read the play without reading the essay and still appreciated it. Others are small ruminations on intersting points which are much less earthshattering. Sure, there are much more &quot;scholarly&quot; essays out there on Shakespeare, but these are all READABLE essays, all well-written. I happen to enjoy Bloom's lack of tight structure. It's like sitting down with Bloom at a coffee house or bar and hearing him ramble on about his thoughts and lifetime reflections on Shakespeare.But remember, Bloom was not just your average guy chewing his cud -- he's probably the most well-read and brilliant reader of our generation. Due to a sleep disorder that he had, he often would stay up all night and would typically consume several volumes of literature in one evening. So, when forced to listen to his musings, there are many kernels of brilliance that make their way to the surface. Many professors have begrudged him his popular success, but by avoiding jargon, Bloom does us all a service by popularizing Shakespeare for everyday readers and making us want to go back and read and reread Shakespeare. At the very least, these chapters will make you run to a bookstore to read more Shakespeare -- how can you criticize anyone who instills a passion for literature? I have read all of Bloom's major works and enjoyed them for many of the same reasons I list above. Buy this one and read a chapter or two at a time along with the plays. It's a book to be savored over a long period of time.

I had an Olympus digital camera for several years but it started to frustrate me. The two HUGE advantages the Canon has is that 1 -- there is NO shutter delay that makes you miss the shot: the shot is taken as soon as you press the button and 2 -- you can buy high quality lenses that make the camera even more amazing. Let me say I'm not a pro photographer or anything, but I figured out how to use all the features of this camera within a day or so. It's very intuitive and fun. Don't be afraid to step up from your non SLR camera. Besides, you can still "point and shoot" in automatic modes, but it's awesome to be able to control just the aperature or just the shutter speed. The pictures this camera takes are incredible!!! I have to admit I've gotten gadget fever. I'll make some recommendations based on my two weeks with the camera.1 -- buy a 1GB or bigger compact flash card with fast download speed. At big megastores they are very much discounted. Also, don't forget to REFORMAT the card every time you put it back -- my old cards always got "corrupted" and the way to avoid that is to reformat every time (just takes 2 seconds -- use the "format card" option on the camera menu).2 -- buy an external flash. You'll notice that the internal flash tends to overexpose yoru subjects -- I bought the Canon 420 (or something like that) and it's amazing. My pics are TWICE as good3 -- I'd recommend NOT buying the kit lens and putting that money towards the exact Canon EF lens you'll need. I bought one zoom and one prime lens and the quality is 10 times better. Plus, a 1000 camera deserves high quality lenses.4 -- don't forget the crop factor when you buy lenses! It's hard to find this out on your own, but because of where the sensor is on Digital SLRS, you have to multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6. So, a 35 mm lens if you put it on this camera is equivalent to a 55mm lens, and so on. Plus, if you have other non-digital cameras, be sure to be EF lenses only, not EF S which only fit on digital cameras.My only complaint (and this is nitpicking) on this camera is that I wish the finish were tougher looking and not quite so plasticky. I like the Nikon cameras and upper level canon camera materials, but I understand that this is how Canon can sell a camera which is optically as good as the 10D for a lot less. On the plus side, it's nice and light.These are my thoughts after the first few weeks -- I LOVE the camera overall and now that I have two great lens, my pics look almost professional, not bad for a mom who doesn't know much about photography.

The first story in Murakami's brilliant short story collection is one of the best in this incredible display of ingenuity. These stories with their Western/Japanese cultural mix still manage to cut to the core of our deepest emotions and experiences. Murakami is definitely different, but it's worth reading his whole oevre starting with these stories because many of his larger symbolic and thematic ideas stem from here. By the time you graduate to the Wind up Bird Chronicle, you'll feel like you have a better grip on how Murakami thinks and explores complex relationships.

I have to confess that my edition (from the library) only had Class Trip: A Novel. There is no listing for that book though, so I have to comment on this book minus the Mustache which was not in my edition. This story reminds me quite a bit of the European film, The Vanishing (Dutch) -- one of the scariest films every made. Like this story, the action is understated, but the horror lurks nearby. Nicholas' dad just happens to be a travelling salesman selling what else but articial limbs and body parts! If that doesn't get the shivers going, what will? On the surface, this is just the story of Nicholas and a 10 day ski trip, but all sorts of mysteries surface. The author includes some references to Poe stories -- clearly he aims for a Poe-like kind of horror, as understated as it may be. This book is not scary to read, but it packs a belated punch, much like the chilling last scene in the Vanishing. If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean and there's even a thematic tie in. It's a quick read (more like a novella), but one that kept me turning pages. Good insights into the anxiety of a young boy's mind.

Unlike the elegiac Winter's Tale (which no one should miss)and the memorable Soldier of the Great War, this book will have you laughing out loud. If you have any coffee addicted friends, you should pass this along to them immediately. Helprin is one of the truly great writers of our time and this book showcases his powers in a more comical light than his other books. Still, he manages to be profound and compelling. Parts of this book are reminscent of scenes from 100 years of Solitude. Not surprising since Helprin uses a kind of magic realism too (but his own brand) in many of his works.

I don't know Jarvis personally, but these essays are tremendously inspirational especially when you consider that they make up some 25 years worth of talks to the Roxbury Latin students. It's refreshing to hear an educator who freely told students that RL was NOT a college prep school but rather a preparation for leading a moral life. His collection of talks combines anecdotes and encounters from many years and ties them together into talks that you just WISH you could read out loud to every student in the country: that you really never get away with anything, that college admissions is not the be all and end all to every academic quest, that we should go out of our way to help others and make an impact on them. This was a fantastic collection -- I ended up dog earing dozens of pages and reading them outloud to anyone who would listen. Do yourself a favor and read it pronto. They don't make them like Jarvis anymore.

I'm not an expert oeneophile (in fact, I can't even spell it), but I am an interested amateur who has read about 5 basic books on wine ranging from Parkers famous one to lesser known tomes (the Windows on the World one is good too). I think this dummies book offers the least pretentious and most concise overall guide to wine. It does cover a lot of ground which is why the same authors have separate books on white and red wines. On the bright side, you'll learn about every major grape variety and region in the wine world and how to find great bargains. I really enjoyed the tone and attitude -- the authors clearly know a lot, but make it clear that you don't have to be a wine snob to really enjoy wine.

Let me start off my saying I agree with the reviewer below who can't help but laugh out loud when reading Barry's writing. I have read every single one of his non-fiction books (most in public places) and I really CANNOT control my laughter. I even grew up in Armonk where Barry did and love all his descriptions of that small town. I'm one of his biggest fans and laugh at almost every sentence he's ever written. So, I don't want to say that this book was bad because that's too strong. It does have many funny lines and some good moments, but it's really just a trifle. I enjoyed the Coconut Grove descriptions and the general descriptions of Miami, I laughed at some of the characters, but overall I lost interest about the middle of the novel and sped read through the last 100 pages or so. For Barry fans I'd recommend it, but for others who haven't yet read Barry's columns or other books, I would definitely recommend skipping this one and going right to any of his other books. I'm glad he got this out of his system so he can go back to non-fiction.

David Drayer has impressed me! For a first novel, this one is a winner. It's a cross between a more innocent, rural Holden Caulfield (the main character, Seth, reminds me of him a bit) in Catcher and Anderson's Winesberg, OH, one of my all time favorites. It's refreshing to see a new writer who does so many things right! The first 5 chapters or so that revolve around Seth are terrific. If anything, I wanted to see more about Seth, although some of the side characters are memorably drawn as well (the shaving chapter was very well done!). The teenage cruelty is done very realistically and touchingly. As usual, the most sensitive one is the one called "jack off" for his whole life but we can tell he's the best catch of them all.The final few chapters take a bit of momentum out of the book -- Seth's early life was much more interesting. But that's only a minor criticism of a terrific first effort.

Along with &quot;el son es el mas sublime,&quot; this is the other disc you must own if you like the whole BVSC thing. Unlike BV, these are the original recordings, but if you don't buy these CD's before they go out of print, you may never be able to hear authentic Cuban music from the 30's and 40's. Every song is a classic. I like para bailar el montuno myself, but every song is great. The notes are helpful and the selection unbeatable. Truly a superlative disc. One of the few Cuban discs that showcases all the various country styles: guajira, changui, son and son montuno.

A note to readers -- the first half of this book is more of a chronicle of WW I than an account of the Lusitania. If you're just a disaster buff, you'll probably like the Titanic stories better than this. The author explains in his final note that he deliberately focused on the historical context and meaning of this event rather than the minutia of the sinking itself (as he does in his Titanic book). I personally enjoyed the WWI refresher. There are still many unanswered questions about the ship's death -- did Churchill deliberately let it be struck to draw the US into battle? We may never know. The author does a nice job of putting this event in context. The sinking chapters are shorter than you'd think (heck, the ship went down in 18 minutes) but there is a lot of juicy background stuff here.

My only small gripe with this book is that it repeats verbatim several chunks of Nightwatch, Dickinson's first book. Overall, this book provides more depth to subjects like buying telescopes, lenses, and more detailed descriptions of what you can see. I didn't find the format as visually pleasing as the spiral bound Nightwatch. Still, the pictures are great, the information written in the same clear style as Nightwatch -- there's something here for everyone. Beginners have a lot to learn, but even the advanced sky enthusiasts will pick up new and useful information. A good overview.

Something about the Booker Prize... I just don't seem to get what makes them select their prizes. Don't get me wrong -- I thoroughly enjoyed this witty, very well written novella about two &quot;old&quot; friends who have a major falling out, but besides the strong writing, I'm not sure what propelled it to the prize. That being said, McEwan does a terrific job of outlining his story starting from Molly's funeral and spiraling outwards from there following all of Molly's former lovers. Perhaps the best scene in the book occurs at the funeral when a staid looking state official pulls one of the main characters by the lapels and says some deliciously wicked things to him. I enjoyed the middle of the novel best, but by the end, I was getting a bit tired and found the ending a bit hyperbolic. Still, the scenes with the famous composer trying to write his masterpiece while hiking in the lake district, so absorbed that he fails to intervene and stop a rapist from attacking, made it an enjoyable read. I recommend it, although i don't think it's a classic that people will know about 50 years from now.

This is a most unusual book in that it goes into excruciating detail about the Navy, the Air Force and carriers. In fact, even though I found it fascinating reading, it's more than most people would want to know unless you're a real fanatic. At times I felt that a foreign power could learn how to duplicate our success by reading this book -- hopefully Clancy left some military secrets a secret!The most enjoyable parts of the book for me were the descriptions of the pilot training (and the amazing prowess of Navy flyers who have to catch a &quot;string&quot; upon landing so they don't fly right off the deck), life aboard a carrier and the interview with the navy official. The chapters devoted to the layout and structure of the carriers were less interesting from my point of view.A very detailed approach to carriers and their role in protecting our role in world affairs.

I've read the other readers criticisms -- it's not that I disagree, I just don't think they interfere with one's enjoyment of the book. Walker may have used too many adverbs or told us more than we needed to know about some families (I imagine he was going after Junger's technique in The Perfect Storm), but he still writes an absolutely riveting account of harrowing helicopter rescues over the most treacherous water in the U.S. The thought of a huge helicopter being blown back a few hundred feet is hard to imagine, yet that is just what happened during 3 rescues the same night with 100 foot rogue waves almost swallowing the helicopter. I enjoyed the descriptions of Alaska's fishing industry and thought Walker did an excellent job of weaving together various interviews. There may be smaller flaws with the book, but you still won't be able to put it down!
