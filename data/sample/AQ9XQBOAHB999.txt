IT HAS A GREAT GOSPEL SONG (WHATEVER YOU NEED) AND DANCE SONGS LIKE: &quot;WHEN THE HEARTACHE IS OVER&quot;-WHICH WAS A #1 HIT IN EUROPE (AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT I SAW TINA IN LAS VEGAS LAST NOVEMBER AND EVERYBODY SANG THIS SONG WITH HER), &quot;TWENTY FOUR SEVEN&quot; AND &quot;WITHOUT YOU&quot; (FEAT.BRYAN ADAMS) AND HAS LOVE SONGS LIKE: &quot;DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY&quot;, &quot;I'LL BE THERE&quot;, &quot;TALK TO MY HEART&quot; AND POP SONGS LIKE: &quot;ALL THE WOMAN&quot; AND &quot;GO AHEAD&quot;.

I HOPE THAT TINA WINS ANOTHER GRAMMY BUT SHE NEEDS MORE AMERICAN SUPPORT.

Great album with good songs and fantastic lyrics.Tina Turner is one of the most important figures in the music industry and every work that she releases has a first class production."24/7" is her second new album in ten years ("What's love got to do with it (1993) and "Simply the best" (1991) weren't new studio albums). This time she chose Cher's producer from her multi-million album "Believe", it also features a never released song from the Bee Gees ("I'll be there"), there's a song with a special appereance of Bryam Adams ("Without you").The first song ("Whatever you need") is a fantastic gospel where features the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the forth song ("Absolutely nothing's changed") was written by Terry Britten, the writer of "What's love got to do wwith it" and other hits.The album goes from soft ballads to rock songs.Tina's voice is wonderful as always and I can say that it's a pleasure listening to this album, you'll never get tired of it.The album was a hit, the critics were very good, the first single was a #1 hit in Europe and the album sold 3 million copies world-wide, reaching #1 in several territories in Europe and #21 in Billboard's Top 200 Albums.

I originally bought the VHS version of this 1990 concert and I really like it. That version released in 1992 was cutted to 13 songs, leaving behind hits such as "JUST LIKE JESSE JAMES" or "HEART OF STONE". Now this re-release on DVD is loaded with special features such as an alternative opening, a big blooper from a concert of this tour that started and Cher's microphone wasn't working, a TV Commercial promoting the the tour, a backstage of home movies with Cher's commentary (Cher makes some comentaries throughout the development of the DVD), a clip from "HEART OF STONE" (song) with a personal camera, photo gallery and a cut from footage of Cher's crew backstage. Next to this extras you can find the tracks "TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS", "HOLD ON", "MANY RIVERS TO CROSS" and "TOUGHER THAN THE REST" with multi-angles of your choice. What I find ridiculous is that on the VHS version this songs were on the concert on its part of the show but now they appear as speacial features. And well I still wonder why they didn't release the WHOLE show without cutting it to just 13 songs. Well I believe that we still have to wait for that version.Other than this, I can say that the show is really good and even tough the production isn't as her "Believe Tour" or as the "Farewell Tour",you can enjoy hits such as "IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME", "I FOUND SOMEONE", "WE ALL SLEEP ALONE" between others and Cher was at her best. If it wasn't for all the cuts, I would've rated it with 5 stars.

I'm glad that the Latin market is growing fast and strong and I was thilled when I heard about this movie.So when it came out I bought it and found it interesting (you wouldn't get board with it) but I felt that it was made to be successful. I mean that because it's &quot;so good and funny&quot; that you feel that &quot;look for success&quot; vibe.About the cast I can say that Sofia Vergara isn't just a pretty face and body, she does it very good. Jaci Velasquez shows that besides having a beautiful voice she can also act good. Roselyn Sanchez is also very good. Finally about Eduardo Versategui I think that he was chosen because of his looks because he doesn't work good at all and I think that maybe because of that he sleeps during almost the whole movie.The story is about a guy (Verastegui) who has 3 women. One in Miami (Vergara), another in New York (Velasquez) and the other in Chicago (Sanchez). Because of his job he spends time in the 3 cities and his home in Los Angeles. Any of the girls know that they are not the only one. But one day they all decide to go to his house in Los Angeles because they heard in a Walter Mercado show (a very famous latin psychic) that women should be alert because their husbands or boyfriends could cheat on them.So at his house the find out the whole story but they can't do something about it at that time because the love of their lifes is sleeping because he took some sleeping pills because of his stress with the three of them.The story has a twist when a police woman starts to chase them because she thinks that they're delinquents.The movie didn't have a lot of success but it's ok, funny and all that but not good.

This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close give life to this stylish, sexy and famous movie that was nominated for 6 Academy Awards.The story is about a man named Dan (Douglas) who is happily married with a 6 year old son. And one day he meets Alex (Close) in a party and few days after when Michael's wife goes to the country with their son. Dan meats again Alex again in a meeting and they have an intense affair during those days.It was all meant to finish there, as an affair but Alex falls helplessly in love with Dan and doesn't want to let him go.Dan's wife returns from the country and he refuses to answer Alex's phone calls and messages but Alex is desperate to see him again and she even cut her veins to make him stay. The whole nightmare starts there and Alex won't stop until Dan belongs to her...You will be watching this movie without closing your eyes beacuse it's full of suspence.

The reason why I went to the cinema to see this movie was because the first one was Ok and when I saw the trailer thought that it was a stupid movie but had some funny scenes.But let me tell you that after 30 minutes I was coming crazy with it because there was nothing good about it and I was hoping Demi would kill the angels so it could be over so I could leave the theatre and the most important thing that there will never be Charlie's angels 3.I may be hard about this movie but I'm being honest, if you haven't seen it you don't know how borring and stupid it is. Besides I don't understand how Jackelyn Smith (singer Pink also appears in the film) agreed to appear in the movie because honestly it's an insult to her good work as an original angel.This is an unrated version but it's just to excite to buy but I've seen this version and there's nothing that could be rated except stupiness.The only good thing that I understood with this movie is that almost always sequels are no good.

Texas is one of the most important singers in Europe she has made several hits and this album is an example of that success.&quot;The hush&quot; was released in 1999 and came out with songs that were ready to be hits like the #1 hit &quot;Summer son&quot;, the #6 hit &quot;In our lifetime&quot; and other singles like &quot;Tell me the answer&quot; and &quot;Move in&quot;.This album is delightful is totally pop but has some twists like &quot;Summer son&quot; but the 90% is soft pop which is very relaxing.Her voice is beautiful and I think that there's no other singer to be compared with her.

It's incredible that she's not with us any longer but her memory and music will always survive."Hits mix" it's an album that contains some of her many, many hits. The remixes are very good, there's a fusion between salsa and dance music. The production starts with one of her biggest hits that happened to be her last, I'm talking about "La negra tiene tumbao", the remix is very good as the spanglish version.My favorite song is the 1995 hit "Que le den candela", but you'll have fun also with songs like: "La sopa", "La vida es un carnaval" and the covers from Santana and Gloria Gaynor ("Oye como va" and "Yo vivire").If your looking for something essencial from Celia. This is one.

Shakira es una cantante con talento pero parece que sus productores y compa&ntilde;ia discografica solo desean ganar dinero a toda costa.Cuando en 1996 Shakira se hizo famosa gracias a su tercer y mejor disco &quot;Pies descalzos&quot;, se expresaba como una chica sencilla y muy inteligente, sus letras eran muy profundas y uno podia escucharla por horas y no aburrirse.Con su disco &quot;Donde estan los ladrones?&quot;, Shakira nuevamente entro en el corazon del publico y a lo grande pero para mi mucha gente desde que hizo el Unplugged, comenzo una caida que desde ahi no para. El Unplugged para mi es un robo a mano armada, no niego que la calidad de voz de Shakira se supero y que las nuevas versiones de &quot;Ciega, sordomuda&quot; y &quot;No creo&quot; fueron muy buenas, pero por amor a Dios como se le ocurrio hacer un disco y es mas un concierto con todas las canciones de &quot;Donde estan los ladrones?&quot; y solamente una de &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; cuando ese disco hizo tanto exitos, por favor y es mas no hubo un cover o algo que llamara la atencion.Despues de ese concierto en Nueva York, la cancion &quot;Ojos asi&quot; se quemo enormemente, todo el dia estaba en las radios y canales de television y bien por Shakira que gusto pero me parecio un exceso incluirla en el disco &quot;Laundry service&quot; que personalmente me parece una buena produccion aunque alejandose enormemente de sus raices. Su ingles es sumamente pobre, no se le entiende ni una sola palabra de lo que canta y las canciones &quot;Rules&quot; y &quot;The one&quot; estan de mas. &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Whenever, wherever&quot;, &quot;Que me quedes tu&quot; y &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; son los unicos temas buenos del disco.Cuando salio la version limitada &quot;Washed and dried&quot; nuevamente se ve el caso de querer ganar dinero desesperadamente que lo unico que hicieron fue agragar un dvd que hubiese sido mejor si lo hubiesen sacado al mercado como un dvd.Y este disco de grandes exitos me parece que es la gota que revalsa el vaso, por favor, digo yo, donde esta la produccion?, no han incluido una cancion nueva y bueno si Shakira esta muy ocupada y no quiere o no puede sacer un tema nuevo, hubiesen extraido uno de sus primero exitos, que me imagino que ha tenido de sus primeros 2 disco que no estan en el mercado, y tambien hay temas de &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; que fueron grandes exitos como: &quot;Pies desclazos&quot; o &quot;Se quiere, se mata&quot; que no han sido incluidos y canciones del bendito disco &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot; como &quot;Moscas en la casa&quot; que no fue single si los han incluido.Hace una semana, el dia 5 fui al concierto que ofrecio Shakira en Lima y fue un fracaso total, la gente estaba aburrida, se vio a una Shakira mucho mas distante del publico (no pouedo negar que la produccion fue buena, pero la gente en un concierto no quiere ver solo focos bonitos o una mujer con un candelabro en la cabeza, la gente se quiere divertir y pasarla bien y esto fue lo ultimo que paso en ese concierto que es mas ni siquiera Shakira tuvo chance de cantar varios temas que seguramente tenia programados para despues que supuestamente se terminaba el concierto y pidiesen mas pero no fue asi porque ni bien Shakira dijo &quot;Gracias Lima&quot;, la gente se para y se fue y cuando comenzo nuevamnete a cantar la gente ni se molesto en volver, se fueron.Lo unico que puedo decir se Shakira es que piense un poco en lo que hace porque asi no va a durar mucho y si alguien cree que exagero que se comunique con un pais sudamericano y vera que no me equivoco.

After the big success of her first album "Toni Brxton" which became 8 times multi-platinum in the US and opened Toni all the markets around the world came "Secrets" which also was a big impact around the world with the #1's hits "you're making me high" and un-break my heart", the album sold 12 million copies worldwide. After this success and taking home 5 Grammy awards, Toni had a very bad time in her life after having a fight with her record company because they weren't paying what she deserved.She came back in 2000 once again with Laface (her record company) with this magnificent album that debuted in the Billboard 200 at #2, the first single "he wasn't man enough" became an instant hit and brought Toni her Grammy #6.When I first bought "The heat" I found Toni's change but in a fresher way with songs like "he wasn't man enough".With "The heat" Toni opened a new style in her music, some of the songs have much more beat than her first ones, actually it's a great combination between rhythm and blues, pop and hip-hop...if you buy it I think you're gonna love as I do.

Diego is having a great time in his career sience he relesed his album TAL CUAL ES which brought thim this Top 10 hit LA ULTIMA NOCHE and then came his Grammy nomination and his hits COLOR ESPERANZA and SUE&Ntilde;OS.Now he is back with an Unplugged that from my point of view it's the best of all the Latin Unplugges. The production it's purely first class with guest stars including Vicentico, Julieta Venegas and La Chilinguita. Duego's voice also sounds good and the song selection it's perfect. Songs like NO LO SO&Ntilde;E and LA ULTIMA NOCHE sound softer but with a catchy rhythm. A very special song in this production is ALBA. One of the biggest hits of one excellent singer/song writer called Antonio Flores, who happened to be Rosario Flores's brother.The new single of this production is CANTAR HASTA MORIR the one is climing almost all Latin charts, I think that the next single should be USTED next to Vicentico.This unplugged shows that Diego Torres can go from another good singer to an icon. He has the talent, voice and charisma to do it, but sometimes that doesn't depend of the singer. Depends of the public and promoton from the record companies.

When Enrique released his first cd back in 1995, I found it terrible, well actually the music and the lyrics were good but his voice back then was horrible. But in 1997 when his second one came out I found it better.So in 1999 after listening to hits like &quot;Esperanza&quot; (Hope) and &quot;Cosas del amor&quot; (Love's things). I bought this tittle and I liked very much. The first song &quot;Nunca te olvidare&quot; (I'll never forget you) is a very good love song such as &quot;Dice por ahi&quot; (They say there around), &quot;Contigo&quot; (With you) or &quot;Alguien como tu&quot; (someone like you).I also like Enrique's happier songs like &quot;Para de jugar&quot; (Stop playing) and one of my favorites, &quot;Ruleta rusa&quot; (I don't know how is the name of this game in English, I'm just gonna tell you how this game is. Is a round board with several colors and each one has an award or you can lose becuase you have to make it spin and when it stops you know if you lose or win something).Returning to the cd, it's very good, I highly recommend it.

The new version with Madonna is very good, the production is better because was made 30 years later. But this original version is so much funny, the actors are amazing.The story is about a woman who is having vacations with her husband and friends in her yacht and one day she and a sailor take a boat to go to a beach so she could swim. When she suggests this to the sailor he says that it was late and dangerous but she didn't care and as result they got lost and ended in a deserted island. So in the island the sailor who wasn't well treated in the yacht because of the master's wife, now decides that it's time to be the master so the rich woman has to do everthing that he wanted if she wanted to eat or be in the cottage that he found. As a result of all this they fall in love.I'd really like to tell more beyond that point but you'll really have to see the movie.This edition is in italian with subtitles in english, but it's better that the movie is in italian because the voices are really funny.Between the original version and the new one there are some changes but not very big because basiclly the story is the same. But if you're choosing between one and the other, I'll strongly recommend this one, the first one. It's much more funnier.

It took Fanny Lu a while to actually get high with this album that was originally released in 2005. During 2006 she found success in Latin America with her first single that became a hit in her country, Colombia where it made it to #1 and was also called "Song of the year". I'm talking about the big hit "NO TE PIDO FLORES" a song that was never out any discotheque list. Then came "TE ARREPENTIRAS" another big hit followed by "ME ACORDARE DE TI". Actually in the US she found her biggest hit so far with her first #1 Latin Track "Y SI TE DIGO".Fanny Lu is special because she has lots of charisma, a great voice and she gives her all when she performances. A big example of that is the song that gives tittle to the album. "LAGRIMAS CALIDAS" is the most tender song of the CD. The CD is mostly influenced with Ballenato but touches POP, something that makes it more special. This is special because has twists because you can feel like singing along with her a happy song and continue with a ballad. "SOLO QUIERO" is another great ballad. On "NO TE PIDO FLORES" I find a great production, just listen to all the instruments on the background. The album really makes you happy it thrills, it gives emotion and on the ballads you can fall in love, well maybe I'm exagerating but that's how it makes me feel.On this US release you can find 2 bonus remixes from "NO TE PIDO FLORES" and "TE ARREPENTIRAS" which are good but nothing special, the original version are better.Give this cd a shot is very, very good, every song is good, you won't be sorry at all if you like tropical music. There is something important that I must say, is that this may be a tropical album with ballads but it doesn't go so far as others from that genere it's between Tropical and POP actually. Just listen to the samples.

Even though the movie was a big hit and won several Oscar awards, I didn't find the soundtrack as good as the movie. The music is nice but actually it's boring to hear. I feel that has a good production and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the rest of the cast (that includes Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifah).I didn't find it intresting.I only like two songs from this album which are: "Cell block tango" sang by Queen Latifah, Lil'kim and Macy Gray and the other song that I like is "Love is a crime" performed by Anastacia.The whole music has the sound of the 20's and 30's.The biggest song of the soundtrack is the #1 dance hit "love is a crime" performed by Anastacia.

I bought this DVD because I like very much Paris Hilton, but I have to honest. I thought it was going to be a stupid show.With this thought don't think that this is a masterpiece, is another show of the lots that you can find nowadays like &quot;The Osbournes&quot; or &quot;Newlyweds&quot; that don't a theme but they are nice to watch when you have nothing to do becuase it's interesting seing the way they live with the luxury and all that but there's nothing more than that. But believe it or not for the first time I laughed with this kind of shows (with &quot;The simple life&quot;), with stupid things actually but I could laugh.The story here is that Paris and Nicole Richie go to a small town without credit cards, money or selfphones. So this means that they have to work and they are out of control and they make the family with who they are living totally crazy.I hope they make a second season somewhere else to see what they do.From all this kind of shows I would recommend this one.

Before buying this cd I knew Rob Thomas from his hit song "SMOOTH" next to Santana and some from MATCHBOX 20 but Rob Thomas never really called my attention. I simply thought that I was going to like it but nothing special. But I was surprised when I played it, I found it very good.This is Rob's first solo album and he does it very good. He follows his music roots but from my point of view also sounds fresher. The first single from this albums was "LONELY NO MORE" a great pop/rock song that made the perfect presentation for the album. It reached #6 on Billboard's Hot 100, then came my favorite song of the album, "EVER THE SAME", this is more a ballad but I don't know why it didn't make it big on the charts, it only peaked at #48 on Billborad's Hot 100. The third single "THIS IS HOW A HEART BREAKS" is also a great song, this is more rock and made it to #52 on the same list.This are some commercial facts of the album. About the album perse, I can tell that has a good mix from ballads to rock tracks, it's really easy to listen, Rob's voice is very good and performs good also, which makes the album difficult for you to get tired. Check the singles and the tracks "ALL THAT I AM", "AM I AN ILUSSION", "PROBLEM GIRL" and "FALLIN' TO PIECES".The DVD part of this production is not very good. It only includes lyrics that you can also find on the booklet, a photo gallery and a short documentary with some behind the scenes from the album but nothing special really.

Enrique Iglesias is one of the best male singers ever. Even though my natural lenguage is spanish, I prefer Enrique's music in english."Escape" is an album that captures you as soon as you play it. The first track "Escape" makes you feel like dancing, the lyrics are good and the rhythm is even better, the same happens with songs like: "I love to see you cry", "Don't turn off the lights" and love songs that are also included on this production, such as the Top 3 "Hero", are very good.Enrique doesn't have a good voice but he knows how to make his music a hit because of the rythms, the production, the lyrics and his style.He must be the most talented cross-over artist, even though he's spanish, he's english is very good and that's something very strange with spanish people. Enrique won a Grammy award ("Best latin pop album")back in 1996 with he's first album.

The tough lady is back with a very good album that shows a more mature Pink who knows exactly what she's doing. Her 2001 cd was a very big success but it seems that this new production until now is just being a moderate hit. The first single &quot;Trouble&quot; went nowhere but that doesn't mean that the album is not good.In this special edition you'll find a DVD that features the &quot;Trouble&quot; video (which is very good), a photo gallery, an interview with Pink, lyrics and a day in her life.The cd has wonderful songs like the second single &quot;God is a DJ&quot; and &quot;Tonight's the night&quot; or one of my favorites &quot;Waiting for love&quot;.This cd has in my own opinion the same direction of &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. If you don't have that cd I can tell you that Pink sings rock songs but she also likes some balads which are very good with her amaizing voice.I really recommend this cd.

I like to check every thursday the Billboard's charting lists and last year I saw in several lists the Norah Jones name but I don't know, she never called my attention and when I heard the song &quot;come away with me&quot; happened the same thing and I didn't buy the album. So this year when I saw the Grammy ceremony I saw as everyone did that she won 5 of them and then I heard the song &quot;I don't know why&quot; and i decided to buy her cd. Played and I found it very good and now I love hearing it while I'm sending mails or even reading a book. It's so relaxing and Norah's voice is extraordinary you can hear this cd all day long and you'lll never get tired.

Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo make a wonderful couple in this movie that it's actually the new version of the Steve Macqueen's version from 1968.This story is about a billionaire (Brosnan) who steals a Monet from the Metropolitan Museum in New York and a woman who works for an inssurance company (Russo) has to recover the painting.In the beginning it all starts as business but the can't hide their attraction.Their performances are very good. This movie is thrilling and funny. A very good one.

Este disco fue lanzado en 1999 cuando Tamara tenia solamente 15 a&ntilde;os, pero claro su voz, que es muy buena, al grado que cualquiera que la escucha piensa que tiene mas 25 a&ntilde;os.&quot;Gracias&quot; es un disco que tiene un 80% de canciones que son clasicos como &quot;Si Dios me quita la vida&quot;, &quot;Un mundo raro&quot; o &quot;Si nos dejan&quot;, entre otros. La cancion mas sonada fue &quot;Celos&quot; que fue escrita por Babu Silvetti, uno o tal vez el productor mas importante de Espa&ntilde;a.Tamara impacto muchisimo con este disco que vendio 1 millon de copies en Espa&ntilde;a y obtuvo grandes criticas positivas. El disco no fue solo un exito en Espa&ntilde;a, llego a paises como Mexico, Puerto Rico, Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina y inclusive los Estados Unidos.Como ultimo me gustaria comentar que es dificil que una ni&ntilde;a de 15 a&ntilde;os grabe este tipo de musica pero su voz es tan biena que creo que seria casi un crimen no explotarla en este tipo de musica.

I think that John Mayer has a very long carreer ahead. His first album brought him two Top 20 hits and a Grammy award. Now with "HAVIER THINGS" he prooves that that wasn't just fluke. The first single of this album, "BIGGER THAN MY BODY", was a great single, it maybe didn't made it very high in the charts (Peaked at #33 on Billboard's Hot 100) but he delivers a great performance.Although this album debuted at #1, it started to fall very fast. One year after, "DAUGHTERS" was released and made the album become Platinum x2 and climb the charts while the song also was also making a good impression until it brought John his second Grammy, this time for song of the year.Anyway, that's just the commercial part of the album . This album has great lyrics, production and John's performances are very good. Both his albums are great, I think that in a way he is the new version of Bruce Springsteen but with own style. Check the songs "CLARITY", "BIGGER THAN MY BODY", "SOMETHING'S MISSING", "SPLIT SCREEN SADNESS" and "WHEEL".

The last cd from The Black Eyed Peas ("Monkey Business") is very, very good and this, the third single of it. Has great and funny lyrics and also the groove to hit the dance floor. The success of "MY HUMPS" is very big, making the song top several charts. In the U.S the single made it to #3 and stayed at that position for several weeks.This enhanced cd includes the single version. You can see on the presentation that puts album version but it isn't because it doesn't include the last 2 instrumental minutes. That cut actually is track 3 on this single called "SO REAL". The Lil'Jon's remix of "MY HUMPS" is good but not as the original version. The group re-recorded the song for this remix. It just isn't one of those remixes where the remixer only changes the background instruments of speed the song.Finally you have the video which I have to be honest, didn't like much in the biginning but know I really enjoy it and find it good.Try the album if you don't have it.

I have to be honest that when Britney Spears came out, I just found her attractive but her music didn't call my attention at all. But then when I heard "ME AGAINST THE MUSIC" next to Madonna and "TOXIC" I bought her cd "IN THE ZONE" and found it very interesting.Now with this cd I notice that Britney's performances are getting better with time and a proof of that are her latest singles "MY PREROGATIVE" and "EVERYTIME". With this latest songs you realize that Britney is not a child any more.The song selection for this production is good including her biggest hits such as "I'M A SLAVE FOR YOU", "STRONGER", "TOXIC" and "SOMETIMES" plus three new songs and remixed versions of "CRAZY", "BOYS" (feat. Pharrell Williams) and "OVERPROTECTED" but I feel sorry that "I LOVE ROCK N' ROLL" isn't here. It should have been added in the bonus cd that contains remixes of "TOXIC", "EVERYTIME", "BREATH ON ME" and "OUTRAGEOUS". Another thing that would've been great was a remix of her latest single "MY PREROGATIVE" but well on every greatest hits album we all find songs missing.Finally I want to say that this is a good album, it may not be your favorite but it has some great songs.

I bought the first Now Dvd when it came out in 2003 and found it ok so I bought this one and honestly, just have few good videos.I think that the best videos are: No Doubt "IT'S MY LIFE", Good Charlote "HOLD ON", Christina Millian "DIP IT LOW", Black Eyed Peas "HEY MAMA", Chingy with Ludacris & Snoop Dogg "HOLIDAE IN", Jessica Simpson "WITH YOU" and Norah Jones "SUNRISE". The rest are just to fill the Dvd. And about calling this the best video collection of the year, that's so funny. Where are great videos as Kelis "Milkshake", Enrique Iglesias "NOT IN LOVE" or Maroon 5 "SHE WILL BE LOVED", just to name a few.I hope that Now can release a good one this year.

This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's thrilling, sad, actually very sad, unfair but teaches us about how not to give up even though the circunstances are terrible.Malika was the daughter of the Prime Minister of Marroco and then the King who was a good friend of her father adopted her to be with the King's daughter Lalla Mina.So when Malika was 18 she went back home with her family and two years after her father was accused of trying to kill the King, so Malika's father was executed and she and her family were sended some time after to a prision and and then to another and they had to suffer lots of things like hunger, humiliation and a kind of life that wasn't human.I strongly recommed this book I've only described a short part of it but i'm sure you'll love it. And once you start reading it you won't stop until you finish it, actually I read it in 2 days because it was so good.

I believe that the third album is the one that consolidates an artist, and after buying her previous two cd's, I found Joss at her very best so far.This album shows a much mature Joss (just by checking the photos on the cd you'll notice it) who has changed her style a little bit. Even though she keeps her roots now she is funkier, she has more rhythm, and this album really cheers you up, and a good thing is that among the great rhythm you can find ballads.The album starts with a Vinnie Jones's intro that it's perfectly followed by from my point of view one of the best songs on the cd. The beated up "GIRL THEY WON'T BELIEVE IT" which really lifts you up. This song really embraces you the the album. Then there is "HEADTURNER" which is follwed by the lead single "TELL ME `BOUT IT" another great track. One of my favorites is "TELL ME WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 'BOUT IT" where features Common. On "MUSIC" you can find Joss next to Lauryn Hill and among the highlights are "BRUISED BUT NOT BROKEN" and "WHAT WERE WE THINKING"."Introducing..." has really made a big impression in the U.S. The album debuted on Billboard's Top 200 Albums at #2 and just after a couple of weeks was certified Gold but I still wonder why the first single didn't find a place at least on the American Top 50 when this girl is really talented and has an amazing voice and performs flawlessly. Well I think that sometimes that's better because when a singer is always on TV or radio you just start to hate him/her.To finish I can only say to give this one a shot is very good so far it's for me the best album released on 2007 so far.

Great album, nice lyrics, Two languages and a beautiful singer, what else can you ask for?.Paulina shows us that she is the queen of crossover (Shakira may have called everybodies attention but Paulina Rubio has a better quality without question, better lyrics, better sound and better voice, but i can't say that Shakira's work was poor).Border girl has everything like: pop, rock, rap, dance and ranchera style.I hope that Paulina makes a good impression in the US and her album becomes one of the top realeses of the year because she deserves it.The album has songs in english from her #1 hit album "Paulina" wich sold over 4 million copies around the world and became multi-platinum in the US and it's still on the charts after two years of its realese, the songs are: "The last goodbye" (el ultimo adios), "Im not that kind of girl" (yo no soy esa mujer), "Sexual lover" (y yo sigo aqui) and "Fire" (sexy dance) wich i think that it wasn't necessary to add but...i'd had added "Lo hare por ti" (if somebody has the album "Paulina" i think that would agree with me).I love the first single "Don't say goodbye" and i think that the socond single should be "Stereo"...she also made a cover with "I was made for loving you" and she does it very good, all the songs are very good, my favorites are: "Don't say goodbye", "Border girl", "I'm not that kind of girl", "Undeniable" and "The last goodbye".I love this album, but the only thing that i don't like about it is that it doesn't have lyrics on the credits book.

When I saw "Million Dollar Baby" after the Oscars, I thought that that was maybe "the best movie of the year". I say this becuase I think that not just because the academy gives that honor, it means that that's the best movie. "The sea inside" should have been at least nominated for best movie and Javier Bardem deserved a nomination because his work is flawless.The story of this film is about the true story of Spaniard Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, who fought for almost 30 years to die with dignity because he didn't want to live because after the accident that he had. He was postrated to a bed without being able to move his body. Along the story you will find another tragedy on someone very close to him. The female lawyer who was helping him also suffers from an illness and here's a point where she also wants to die. She was also the woman who helped him publish his book.The story is amazing from the tragedy to Ramon's relationship with his family and a woman who falls in love with him and also helps him die . The actors work splendidly. Also Almen&aacute;bar's work is fantastic (he's the director of "The others"). With "The sea inside" he won his first Oscar and his carreer is expanding very fast.The DVD's speacial features include deleted scenes, a documentary, director's commentary, photo and set design galleries and theatrical trailer.Don't miss the chance to see this movie. You will love it. It's very strong and intense but it's worth it.

Definitely Norah Jones is a first class singer and a very good proof of her talent is this amazing DVD.This show was captured in New Orleans few months before she won 8 Grammys with her debut album, the Multi-platinum, #1 &quot;Come away with me&quot;.The show starts with &quot;Cold, cold heart&quot; and from there you go through a wonderful experience all the way to &quot;Don't know why&quot;, the song that closeses the show.The atmosphiere in this show is very simple but intense, don't imagine a show like Cher's with lots of lights, change of custumes and all that. This was taken at the House of Blues in New Orleans but it's really amazing. Norah's music if you don't know it very well is soft but delightful, you can listen to her for hours, days, months...all your life and never get tired and if you know her music or have one or both of her cds, this is a must have.You'll find here almost all her &quot;Come away with me&quot; repertory and some unknown songs. You'll also get the change to see her &quot;Come away with me&quot; video as a special feature and the encored &quot;Tennessee waltz&quot;.I recommend the songs &quot;Cold, cold heart&quot;, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Seven years&quot;, &quot;Feelin' the same way&quot;, &quot;Come away with me&quot;, &quot;Lonestar&quot; and &quot;Don't know why&quot;.You won't be sorry with this DVD.

First of all I have to be honest, in the beginning I didn't like Britney at all. But when she released her second album I liked &quot;Stronger&quot; but it was just a good song. When &quot;Britney&quot; came out in 2001 I found &quot;I'm a slave for you&quot; very good and then I started to like her a little more.So finally last year when this album came out. Britney was a new woman, she was looking better than ever and her music was very much better. Don't compare it with her first cd which I think it's horrible. It's clear that singers know better how to do it with the years. The first single &quot;Me against the music&quot; with Madonna is amazing. The song didn't make it big in the charts (it peaked at #34) but it's great. The the second single &quot;Toxic&quot; which is my favorite in the album is simply amazing, the rhythm, the video (really cool video). This second single is passing the first one's success in the charts.In general &quot;In the zone&quot; is very good, this album is also an example that there're singers who don't have a very good voice but they know how to use it. In this production I like very much: &quot;Breath on me&quot;, &quot;Early mornin'&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;.Although I never thought that I could ever like this girl I have to admit that now I like her music. And finally I recommend her up comming DVD that will contain this album's videos and how they made this production possible.

Amy is one of those singers or persons that calls the attention. Her voice and style are unique.This album from my point of view, is a piece of music that everybody should have, it's a gem because it can fit any style. It's classic and trendy, fun and blue at the same time and that's something very difficult to make. You could think that you're listening a very good remastered album from the 50's. She makes me remember Della Reese.This is Amy's second album, her first one is "FRANK" from 2003. It was a hit in the U.K but wasn't released in America until 2007. (That one is also very good).Amy's explosion came with the international massive hit "REHAB". I think that I don't have to comment it because I Think that everybody knows the song. The impact of the hit was enough to make her a winner of 5 Grammy awards and reaching #1 in Europe and #2 in the U.S plus getting her album to the Multi-platinum status.In overall the album is mellow and rough (actually it's not easy to make a review of this album). The most beat-up songs in the album besides "REHAB" are. "YOU KNOW THAT I'M NO GOOD" (there are 2 version of this song on this edition. The original which is track 2 and track 11, that is a remix. I find track 2 better than 11), "BACK TO BLACK", "JUST FRIENDS", that has a reggae touch and "TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN". The other are softer songs specially "LOVE IS A LOSING GAME", which is the softest one.If you haven't heard much of Amy's music, give this one a try. You may not like it very much in the beginning but after a couple of times, you start to really like it. That heppened to me. I would start listening first to me songs that I mentioned before "Love is a Losing game".

I like some of her songs like: "Regresa a mi", "Entre el mar y una estrella" and even "No me ense&ntilde;aste" and I also have some of her albums. So when I went to a music store to check this production (I was planning to buy) I noticed that some hits weren't here like "Gracias a Dios", "Por amor" and "Sudor" which was a big hit back in 1992. The only good thing here is the DVD but come on!, it's like she's releasing an album every month, since 2000 she's been releasing one every 6 or 8 months, what's that?. She should come back with a brand new album, new songs.I think that her crossover album was good, she's talented but I feel like she's burning her songs in the sense of repeting them all the time.Finally I would have added "Closer to you" that sounds very good instead of "Cerca de ti" and "I want you" instead of "Me pones sexy" which sounds ridiculous.

I like some Thalia's songs, she's talented, I have 3 of her albums but let me say that this is not a good Greatest Hits. The only good thing in this edition is that contains a DVD.It seems that Thalia is having preasure with her record company because they are releasing albums like every month ("Con Banda" 8-2001, "Thalia" 5-2002, "Hits remixes" 2-2003, "Thalia" (English) 7-2003) only a singer that releases this frequently is because selling is not very good. One example is her crossover in 2003, the single "I want you" was a hit it reached #24 in the Billboard's Hot 100 but the album only sold 170,000 copies.About this album I can say that there are some good songs missing like: "Por amor", "Gracias a Dios" and "Sudor" which was a big hit back in 1992. Not everything is bad here, you'll find good songs like: "Entre el mar y una estralla", "Regresa a mi", "No me ense&ntilde;aste" and "A quien le importa".And to finish with this album's review. I think that she should've added "I want you" instead of "Me pones sexy" and "Closer to you" instead of "Cerca de ti". They sound very good in English but horrible in spanish. I think that it's not good to translate songs, they don't sound good.I would like to comment something that happend 4 days ago. Thalia went to sing to a discotheque and Paulina Rubio arrived so the next day Thalia said that she was ungry because Paulina went there to get publicity for her new album that was going to be released the next day, but maybe Thalia said that for her own publicity because she was releasing this album the same day as Paulina. Come on is Thalia the owner of the world, doesn't a famous person can go to a place where she is?. I think that that is rediculous, Paulina doesn't need publicity to sell her albums, she hasn't made a big publicty for her new album and Thalia's latest album is being aired on TV all day long to get publicty so she can sell well.Thalia is a Latin Diva but she is not the only Latin Diva, there are others and Paulina is one as well. Sorry Thalia fans but I'm not lying.

Maybe this album didn't reach the status of his 2001 hit album &quot;Escape&quot; but &quot;7&quot; is a very good album full of rhythm and good lyrics.The first single &quot;Addicted&quot; is a ballad that follows the same direction of this hit single &quot;Hero&quot;. &quot;Not in love&quot; is the second single and it's very good. The song has the same rhythm as &quot;Escape&quot;. You may had listened the version with Kelis that it's very good but I don't know why it doesn't appear on this production.One of the best songs in the album is the beated up &quot;The way you touch me&quot;. Other good songs are &quot;California callin'&quot;, &quot;You rock me&quot;, &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Live it up tonight&quot;.&quot;Addicted&quot; comes also in Spanish but even though Enrique's performance is very good. It doesn't equal the English version.You won't be sorry if you buy this album, it's very good although Enrique doesn't have a nice voice but he really knows how to sing and feel the music.

Savage Garden has been a wonderful group that with only 2 albums sold millions of copies.Darren Hayes gave the voice to both albums (actually he has a solo album, but isn't as good as the ones that he made as Savage Garden), this two guys are from Australia and they both wrote all the songs.The first single of this album was "I know I loved you", a very good ballad that became an international hit, they following singles were: "Hold me" (this song for me it's the best of the album, the lyrics are really honest), "The best thing" (this is a dance song, real good).One of the songs (The animal song) was specially written for the 1999 movie, "The other sister"."Affirmation" is a great album, all the songs are good, they have rhythm and the lyrics are fantastic. I just don't get why do groups always split and when they do, they're members don't have the success that they had as a group, for me that's non sence.I hope they get together again and make a new album.Actually I think that I heard that they were couple, maybe that's why they broke the group.

I like very much Rosario's music because even tought is very cheerful also has some good ballads and her voice is very mellow. Her style is a mix of pop, flamenco, rock and rumba.Rosario is very talented and has many hits including "ESTOY AQUI", "QUE BONITO", "COMO QUIRES QUE TE QUIERA", "AGUANTA AHI" among others. Both of her latest cd's won a Latin Grammy Award and her live performances are simply flawless. This must come from her roots. Her mother was Lola Flores one of the biggest artists that Spain ever had.On this production she cames with 11 songs that from my point of view the highlights are: on the rhythm ones are "EL BESO (CONTIGO ME VOY)", "MIENTRAS ME QUEDE CORAZON" and "CAYETANO" (which reminds me a bit to her song "LOS TANGOS DE MI ABUELA") and along the ballads are "MI AMOR POR TI", "EL NI&Ntilde;O DE TUS OJOS" and "PARECE QUE FUE AYER".When I bought this album I knew that I was going to like it but as usual when we buy a cd from a singer that we like, we don't like it very much until we get used to it, but on this case as soon as I played it for the first time I liked it.You won't feel sorry with this one if you like Rosario and if you don't know much about her, listen the samples.Finally I would also recommend her cd's "MUCHAS FLORES" (2001) and "DE MIL COLORES" (2003).

This re-release is very good, some people may say that it is not worth enoght to buy but I think that every re-release is for the fans or people who really likes the original version.The difference between this Deluxe edition with the original are 3 bonus tracks and a bonus DVD with the videos of "SUNRISE" and "WHAT AM I TO YOU", live versions of "IN THE MORNING", "THE LONG WAY HOME", "CREEPING IN" and "SHE" which doesn't appear on this cd or in her first one. This live videos were taken on her show in Barcelona. Finally you get a 20 minute interview of Norah."FEELS LIKE HOME" is a great album as Norah's first, "COME AWAY WITH ME". Her music is very relaxed and her lyrics are very good also. This album contains a duet with Dolly Parton. The song leaves a bit behind Norah's jazz/pop music to a country style. Very good actually. Check the tracks "THOSE SWEET WORDS", "SUNRISE", "WHAT AM I TO YOU", "TOES" and "BE HERE TO LOVE ME".

After the big impact of her CD &quot;Come away with me&quot; that won 8 Grammys and had been certified Platinum x8 and it's still on the Top 50 on the Hot 200 from Billboard after 2 years of its release.Norah Jones comes back with this delightful CD with the same style of the first but well I might add that it contains a smooth touch of Country style but sounds very good. The lyrics are fantastic along with the instruments and Norah's voice that really makes you relax and feel pleased. Personally I listen to her music at home while I'm reading or sending mails and sometimes when I'm driving and it really relaxes me.You can also find a duet with Dolly Parton on this production.If you like this production, I'm more than sure that you'll love &quot;Come away with me&quot; (I prefer that one).

I never heard about Coti until I saw his video next to Paulina Rubio and Julieta Venegas singing "NADA FUE UN ERROR". A song that has become an international smash and gave Coti the opportunity to show his talent.This live album includes all his hits plus 3 new songs. To be honest I don't know which are the hits and which are the new ones, anyway, I think that this is a good production including duets next to Paulina, Julieta, Ismael Serrano and Josemi Carmona and besides this Coti's music is very fresh and relaxed, his lyrics are good and his voice is fine. All this together makes a good combination.The highlights from my point of view are the songs "NADA FUE UN ERROR", "ANTES QUE VER EL SOL", "OTRA VEZ", "TU NOMBRE", "ESTA MA&Ntilde;ANA" and "NUECES".

The only word that I can use for this CD is WOW!, it's beautiful, all the songs are great, I can really say that the waiting time was worth it.As soon as you play the CD, it starts with the the incredible "I'm alive", I think that this is Celine's best (it's really strange that didn't charted in the Hot 100, well I think that sometimes that's better because when a good song tops the charts it means that maybe you're gonna hate it because they play them to much).The second song "Right in front of you" has a mix of great sound and beautiful lyrics, this one is followed by "Have you ever been in love" which is a romantic soft ballad, track #4 was written by Tina Turner's songwritter Terry Writting (What's love got to do with it), the song is "Rain, tax", after this song comes the great hit "A new day has come", what a wonderful song!, then comes "Ten days" actually this song it's a cover from a french singer (I don't remember his name) the song is powerful.If you wanna dance you have track #11 "Sorry for love".Really I can only say buy this album, it's a must have.If you want to know more about this album, I can say that it sold 2 million copies only on its first week, now is certified in the US as Platinum x2, but I think that in no time it's gonna be Platinum x3.It's really strange that Celine didn't get any Grammy nominations this year, but the album deserves at least 1 Grammy.

I bought this book as soon as it came out and I was more than impressed when I saw the quantity of people that was at the door of the library. It was so crowded that I thought that I wasn't going to be able to get one.Well about the book I can tell you that it's very dinamic even though it's way to big and that's why I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5. But believe me it's worth it. You can get the change to know the whole life of one of the most important men on earth. Everybody knows that Bill's life has been through everything and what it's very funny is when he tells his story with Monica and the day he told Hillary. He says that she sended him to sleep to a couch. Imagine the president of the U.S sleeping on a couch. You can also learn several things here. Actually to review this book it's not that easy because you go through lots of important stories and it's very difficult to tell everything in a short way. Another thing that I would like to say, is that he narrates everything in a very relaxed and fresh way that helps you to read it faster and don't make you tired. Well your hands are gonna get tired because of the weight of the book.Get it, you won't be sorry at all.I think that he has been one of the best presidents of the United States. The country was stronger and peaceful and what I don't understand is how some people wanted to make him quit just because he had a lover. I mean ok, but how can you change a good president just for that but well, somethings are difficult to understand.

First of all I have to say that I thought that this album was going to be an album with only 2 or 3 good songs but actually it's very good.Jessica goes from covers like Robbie Williams's hit &quot;Angels&quot; where Jessica gives her whole voice in a very good interpretation and also the hit from the 1986 Top Gun soundtrack &quot;Take way breath away&quot; which is her latest single and it's climbing the Hot 100 very fast to her own songs that are better than in the past. The album's first single was &quot;The sweetest sin&quot; which is a very good song but didn't make it big (I bought the CD because of that song). Then the Top 16 hit &quot;With you&quot; is also very good as &quot;My way home&quot; or &quot;Underneath&quot;.If you're planning to buy this album I'd tell you to get this version that contains a bonus track plus a DVD with footage of Jessica's wedding and also footage from &quot;Newlyweds&quot; for just $1 more.

I like Alejandra very much and I'm glad that finally we have the option of having part of her videography, but I have to say that I would give without hesitation 5 stars, but the DVD set is kinda poor.First of all, some very successful videos such as "HACER EL AMOR CON OTRO" or "LA CIUDAD ARDIO" are missing, there are no special features and they should have remastered with more quality her videos from the early 90's and finally I think that for some big hits that maybe didn't have videos , I think that live performances would have made this DVD production much more impressive. That's my negative opinion but not everything is negative. The videos are very good. As the DVD rolls you'll find more production and a much better performancer in Alejandra. In my opinion the best videos are her latest. The one with the best production is "TU ERES MI LUZ" from her 2004 release "LIPSTICK", the #1 hit "VOLVERTE A AMAR" has a very good video as also from her 2006 album "INDELEBLE", "QUIERO ESTAR CONTIGO".I really recommend this DVD, you won't be sorry at all. Alejandra is a very good singer.

This three time Grammy Award winner finally edits a Greatest hits album. The strange thing is that it happened only a couple of months after the release of his latest studio album "Seal IV".In this cd you can find his biggest hits (there are some modest hits that are missing but that happends in every greatest hits album) but other than that I think that they made a good selection. Besides his biggest hit, the #1 "KISS FROM A ROSE" you can find the Top 10 singles "CRAZY" and "FLY LIKE AN EAGLE". Then comes the Top 50 like "PRAYER FOR THE DYING" and "DON'T CRY".There's also a new song. "WALK ON BY" which is very good. This album debuted at #47 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums and there are also two versions. This one and the one with the golden cover. The difference is that the golden one is a special edition with some other versions of the songs.If you like Seal you will definitely not be sorry with this album, is very good but the only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't contain lyrics in the credits book.

This is the new and enhanced version of Tina's 1984 "PRIVATE DANCER" album. Through the years this album has been changing because of the big demand and great selling history. The original version from 1984 only included 9 tracks and then when cd's came out, "HELP" was added. Now with this ultimate version you can enjoy 4 bonus tracks ("I WROTE A LETTER", "ROCK N' ROLL WINDOW", "DON'T RUSH THE GOOD THINGS" and "WHEN I WAS YOUNG"). This songs are from Tina's comeback effort in the early 80's. The songs are ok but I think that they're kinda weak for such a great album, but well as bonus tracks they pass (I mean this because if you know much about Tina you can see that she still doesn't find herself very much as a rock singer, this is the period where she moves from soul, r&b; and a bit of rock to just rock, where Tina didn't stay 100% because she's more a pop/rock singer). Then within the additional tracks you can find 3 remixes from "WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT", "BETTER BE GOOD TO ME" and "I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN". Now this additionals are great.The booklet has also been enhanced with new great pictures but there's also one thing that I regret. That, the original cover photo from this production, the one where Tina appears seated in some kind of sparkled platinum hillock showing her whole fantastic legs (but well that photo appears inside the booklet. If you see it I'm more than sure that you'll agree with me), has been changed sience the late 80's to the one where she appears with a cat.Well I had commented what I didn't like very much from this new version but I also have to tell what makes this album so great and famous. This was the best-selling album of 1984-85 in the world with sales of 15 million, it brought Tina back in the spotlight, brought her 6 Grammy nominations (she won 4), made Grammy history when she was nominated for 3 Grammys in 3 different music categories for Best Female Vocal Performance in Rock for "BETTER BE GOOD TO ME", Pop for "WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT" and R&B; for "LET'S STAY TOGETHER". Brought Tina her first #1 hit with "WHAT'S LOVE" (which was also chosen by Billboard as the #1 song of 1984), it also brought her 4 Top 10 hits in the U.S ("LET'S STAY TOGETHER", "BETTER BE GOOD TO ME", "WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT" and "PRIVATE DANCER") and it Europe got 5 Top 10 hits (the named and "I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN"). "I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN" wasn't released in America, when the fifth single was to come out at that time, Capitol chose "SHOW SOME RESPECT" for America and "I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN" for Europe.This production is very special because it shows a big difference in Tina's performances if you compare it with her early solo productions and her productions with Ike. The song that opens the album, "I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN" is a great track and I find it very hard to believe that it wasn't a single, then track 8, "STEEL CLAW" is Tina's most rock n' roll track ever.I think that this album is a must have, even if you have Tina's 2005 biggest hits compilation "ALL THE BEST", you can find here amazing songs that you won't find there. I'd also recommend you her 1989 album "FOREIGN AFFAIR" (that's my Tina's favorite).

After being a Destiny's Child and an Afro Queen in the latest Austin Powers movie, Beyonc&eacute; strikes again with this fabulous album.The cd starts with the #1 hit &quot;Crazy in love&quot; where features Jay-Z. The song besides being a hit is very good it has wonderful rhythms and Beyonc&eacute;'s voice is amazing.&quot;Dangerously in love&quot; has great songs such as &quot;Naughty girl&quot;, &quot;Be with you&quot;, &quot;Me, myself and I&quot; and a very good duet with Luther Vandross in &quot;The closer I get to you&quot;. A nice ballad.The production includes several guests such as Jay-Z, Sean Paul, Big Boi, Sleepy brown and Luther Vandross.This cd is ment to be a hit. It debuted at #1 in the U.S and the U.K, the first two singles had reached #1 and there's more on the way.Beyonc&eacute; is not only beautiful and talented, she really knows how to sing and her voice, lyrics, rhythms and producers are amazing.Good work, really.

The reason why I titled this review like this is because this collection could have been much, much better.This Collection was released in 1994 and contains her early years hits with her ex husband Ike Turner, some rare recordings and Tina's solo hits.*DISC 1 (Ike and Tina):This cd contains the collection of Ike and Tina's hits and some of their best recordings. This goes from 1960 to 1975.Their biggest hits were &quot;A fool in love&quot;, &quot;It's gonna work out fine&quot;, &quot;I idolize you&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. &quot;Nutbush city limits&quot; and &quot;River deep-mountain high&quot; were recorded during the Ike and Tina years but were official Tina singles.Together they recorded several albums and singles but they were just big on stage. With this I'm not saying that they were bad, they were very good, they even won a Grammy in 1971 and toured in Europe with the Rolling Stones and alone but it didn't work very well in the charts.On this cd you can also find some covers that were moderate hits like &quot;Come together&quot;, &quot;I've been loving you too long&quot;, and &quot;Honky tonk women&quot;.I also really like &quot;I want to take you higher&quot; and &quot;Crazy 'bout you bay&quot;.*DISC 2 (Tina's rare recordings):On this cd you'll find some songs that were recorded for soundtracks, various albums, live songs, duets and even demos that Tina recorded to get music deals after she broke with Ike Turner.The opening track &quot;Acid queen&quot; was specially recorded for Tina's part in &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Total control&quot; appears in the &quot;We are the world&quot; album, &quot;It's only love&quot; (I don't know why this song is here because it was a very big hit that she recorded with Bryan Adams so it should be in disc 3), &quot;Don't turn around&quot; is a wonderful song that she recorded for her &quot;Break every rule&quot; album but it only appeared as the B side of her &quot;Typical male&quot; single. Finally you'll find &quot;Addicted to love&quot; a song that Tina has been singing sience 1986 on stage. And the duets with Eric Clapton and Rod Stewart &quot;Tearing as apart&quot; and &quot;It takes two&quot;.*DISC 3 (Tina's hits sience 1983):This disc contains Tina's hits but some are missing and others like &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Paradaise is here&quot; which are great songs but were not big singles are here, leaving behind &quot;One of the living&quot;, &quot;Two people&quot;, &quot;I don't wanna lose you&quot;, &quot;Show some respect&quot; and &quot;Way of the world&quot; which were big hits.The great hits that are here are: &quot;Let's stay together&quot;, &quot;What's love got to do with it&quot;, &quot;Private dancer&quot;, &quot;Better be good to me&quot;, &quot;We don't need another hero&quot;, &quot;Typical male&quot;, &quot;The best&quot; and &quot;I don't wanna fight&quot;.In general this collection is good but they should do a real collection with all the hits and more rare songs and even songs that were not released as singles but are great recordings.

This is Luis's fourth album and in my opinon is the second best (my favorite one is 2000's &quot;Eterno&quot;) but I must say that his voice is better and you can feel him more comfortable now.&quot;Abrazar la vida&quot; as all his albums have first class production. Luis's style is still the same. Romantic pop songs and sometimes some with more rhythm as track #6 &quot;Yo&quot;, which is one of the best songs in this production or &quot;Yo te propongo&quot;.The lead single &quot;Quien te dijo eso?&quot; climbed to #3 in the U.S Latin Charts and the album debuted at #3 also in the U.S.This album have songs for all moods for when you feel like dancing, melancholic or even depressed. It's very good. I think that Luis is going to go very far, he is very talented and his voice is very good.This production contains a DVD where you can find an interview with Luis, the making of the video &quot;Quien te dijo eso?&quot;, a day in Luis's life and the making of the album.

This song is the best song Celine ever recorded, it's amazing as soon as you play it you'll really feel alive. The song is perfect to hear it in a place such as Miami with sun and driving a convertible and feel the wind, the nature. The lyrics are very good and the beat is amazing.Get this single, you'll love it, you won't feel sorry. I'm sure that as soon as you play it you'll love it and then you'll buy the album.Good work Celine this is your best song ever.

I never thought that I was going to like another cd from Shakira as "PIES DESCALZOS" because even tough "LAUNDRY SERVICE" had a huge hit around the world, I found that album weak and Shakira didn't developed her beautiful and amazing voice very much.Anyway, "FIJACION ORAL" is a very mixed album. The first single, "LA TORTURA" (The torture) next to Spanish icon Alejandro Sanz is a very good Reggaeton track. Maybe you are not going to like it very much the first time that you hear it but you're going to end up loving it (that's what happened to me). Following that track you will find "OBTENER UN SI" a Bossa Nova type song with catchy chorous. The openning track "EN TUS PUPILAS" is a soft balland which is followed by "LA PARED", another ballad but with a more beated up chorous. Actually 80% of the tendency of the album are soft songs with some beats but it's very good. The strongest song is "ESCONDITE INGLES".This album includes something never included on any Shakira album. For the first time she recorded a song not written by her. That song is "DIA ESPECIAL", one of my favorite songs in the album. The song was written by Gustavo Cerati (Leading singer of Argentina's Soda Stereo). He also sings in the chorous of this song and in "NO". "LAS DE LA INTUICION" is a simple pop song but with nice rhythm, "DIA DE ENERO" is ok, it's actually the song that I like the least but it's ok and the closing track of the album, "LO IMPRESINDIBLE" is great. The lyrics are good and Shakira delivers the song splendidly. Finally the last two tracks are are bonus. You will find an acustic version of "LA PARED" and a remix of "LA TORTURA".I have the dual disc version of this album and I think that the difference on the bonus material is very good. The cd side is the same but the DVD side includes the video of "LA TORTURA", an interview that Alejandro Sanz makes to Shakira at his house in Miami. The interview takes like 12 minutes and you have like 5 minutes of footage of how the album was made in Shakira's house in the Bahamas. What I like of the DVD is that you can also listen the album and you have the chance to be reading the lyrics on your tv's screen while you play it. You can find the lyrics whether in Spanish or English. This option and the music video are the best from the DVD side.

I love "Sex and the city" and I can't belive that this year it's to end this adventure of theese 4 ladies. They can easily go on with the show for 5 more years, it's a pity but there's nothing we can do.I always say "This is the best season" that actually happends with the latest season. In this season you can laugh without stop when Samantha falls in love with a lesbian, when Carrie saw her engagement ring and doesn't like it or when Charlote finds out that Trey is only impotent on her bed. As always in this series you see how this 4 girls love eachother when Miranda's mother dies.Lucy Lu appears in this season when Samantha want's to buy a Hermes handbag and she has to wait 4 months but she said that was for Lucy and she gets it and then Lucy thinks it's for her and when Samantha tells her the truth Lui comes mad (one thing is to expalin it here but other is to see it).They' re all great actresses I you haven't seen the series before I recommend you to see from the first season and if you've seen it I don't need to say anything because I know you'll buy it.I hope that the release next year the fifth and sixth seasons together considering that the fifth has only 8 episodes and I must also say that we, all the fans from this series such do something to make this hit show go on.

After the big success of her 2001/2002, Grammy award winning album &quot;No more drama&quot;, Mary is back with this excellent production.On &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot; you'll find a Mary more concentrated on love songs, songs with more affection if we compare this album with her others, but Mary doesn't leave fun behind either.The first single was &quot;Love at first sight&quot; which became a Top 20 hit, follwed by &quot;Ooh!&quot; a song with an excellent performance from Mary. The song climmed to #34. And finally the lastest single was &quot;Not today&quot; next to Eve.This album has special appearences from Jay Z, P. Diddy (who also produced the album next to Mary), 50 Cent, Eve and Method Man.&quot;Love &amp; Life&quot; debuted at #1 and has been certified Platinum, with this Mary prooves that she's still the Queen. She's really good and her voice is amazing, there are some songs in this album where you can feel her crying while singing the songs and when she wants to make you party she does it also very good.From my point of view the best songs are: &quot;Love &amp; life&quot;, &quot;Not today&quot;, &quot;Ooh!&quot;, &quot;Let me be the 1&quot;, &quot;Feel like makin' love&quot;, &quot;Special part of me&quot; and &quot;Love at first sight&quot;.

The success of this album was and still is incredible. With sells up to 20 million, Grammys and hit singles.It all started with the ballad &quot;You're still the one&quot; which was the first single and thanks to it, Shania started to be known in new territories with her music and not by name.&quot;Come on over&quot; goes from the #1 hit &quot;You're still the one&quot; to the Revlon's TV music spot with Shania's &quot;Man! I feel like a woman&quot;. Then to the theme of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant's &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and other hits like &quot;When&quot;, &quot;From this moment on&quot; and &quot;That don't impress me much&quot;.Shania's music is a mix of country music and pop. Commercially is qualified as country but it has a big pop influence.This album is very good, it's fresh and fun.

I think that this album was one of the best releases of 2002. The second single &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot; had been heard around the world topping almost every charting list.Besides the success, the album is great great, it's a great dance album and Kylie's voice is perfect for this kind of music.There are 3 more hit singles of this album which are: &quot;Come into my world&quot;, &quot;In your eyes&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Love at first sight&quot;.The album debuted in the Billboard 200 at #3 and has been certified Platinum in the U.s.I can't compare this album with another 'cause is unique.

I'm a big fan of Tina Turner and besides having her cd's I also have some of her live videos. And if you haven't seen Tina on stage, I have to tell you that you're missing an electrifying experience.After touring for 4 years with sold out shows. Tina released this production in 1988 after the impact of &quot;Private dancer&quot; and her 1986 hit album &quot;Break every rule&quot;.&quot;Tina live in Europe&quot; cointains her biggest hits live as a solo singer (without Ike) and it also contains duets with: David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Bryan Adams and Robert Gray. There's a section on cd2 where Tina sings old classics such as &quot;A change is gonna come&quot; and &quot;Midnight hour&quot;.Tina delivers her best in songs like: &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Let's stay together&quot;, &quot;Two people&quot;, &quot;A change is gonna come&quot; and other ballads. But she also rocks with songs like: &quot;Show some respect&quot;, &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Typical male&quot;, &quot;Addicted to love&quot; (a classic on Tina's concerts) and &quot;Better be good to me&quot;.Tina's tour was worldwide but besides her incredible success of &quot;Private dancer&quot;. In 1986 and 1987 Tina had an amazing hit in Europe with her &quot;Break every rule&quot; album and because of that an her early solo years. Tina felt that Europe was always there for her and this cd was a gift for her European fans.This album won a Grammy in 1989 and sold millions in Europe and Asia, but in the U.S it only reached #88 in the Hot 200.Part of this tour was her Guiness Records record of 1988 when she sang in Rio in front of 182,000 people at the Maracana stadium.

When Nip/Tuck was released, it didn't really called my attetion but now, 3 years after it was released I gave it a shoot and bought this DVD from the first season and I'm very glad I did.The series are about the life of two of the best plastic surgeons in Miami, who underneath prefection and luxury hide secrets and drama. Sean McNamara played by Dylan Walsh has a partner, Christian troy (Julian McHahom) and even though he seems to have the perfect life. Being a successful surgeon including a wife and two kids, he's depressed and doesn't feel good about himself, his marriage is almost destroyed and his relationship with his partner isn't the best. On the other side there's Christian who happends to be the opposite. He's single, dates the best girls in Miami, lives life freshly and in a way he has the driving wheel of his clinic next to Sean. Everything goes fine for Christian and Sean at work until one day they have the visit of a undergrounded personage who is going to give them lots of problems. This is so serious that they even get one step from going bankruptcy. On the love field, while Sean is trying to safe his marriage, his wife and Christian have some encounters, Christian gets involved in problems with two girls...anyway it's impossible to even blink your eyes because everything goes from interesting to much more interesting while you go through other episodes.The stories are very good, the actors are flawless, the speacial effects are one of the best from the series nowadays but the only defect about this show is that the locations are poor, the producers should've concentrated more on locations beacuse Christian's appartment and Sean's house aren't nice at all and you don't get to see anything from Miami because I even think that they shoot in Miami. It would've been great if they gave footages from Miami as they do on CSI Miami, buy well the episodes are so good that this goes to a second level.This DVD edition includes some interesting speacial features including the making of 3 documentaries showing how cast and creators work, some deleted scenes, a music video from the theme "A perfect lie", subtitles in English, Sapanish and French among other special features.

"Foreign affair" is one of those albums that you just must have.Tina Turner is a legend in music and everybody thinks that her 1984 hit album "Private dancer" it's her best because of the several Top 10 hits, the bunch of Grammy awards that it won and the almost 20 million copies it sold but "Foreing affair is more than that. Tina is at her very best (I'm not saying that she is not good anymore)I mean her look, she was still with her long hair, her voice, her lyrics and singing were stronger."Foreign affair" besides being and album full of strengh and fantastic lyrics and sounds was a very big hit. It sold almost 10 million copies, was nominated for several Grammy awards and has classic hits such as the #1 "The best", and the Top 16 singles "Steamy windows", "Be tender with me baby", "Foreign affair", "I don't wanna lose you" and "Look me in the heart".This album was produced by Tina and hit singer/producer Tony Joe White who actually wrote some of the songs for the album.Whether you're a Tina's fan or not you must have this one, really you won't be sorry at all.

I have Cher's whole discograaphy sience 1987, when she released her first Geffen record. They're all great but definitely &quot;Heart of stone&quot; is the best.This album is from 1989, it includes some of Cher's biggest hits ever such as: &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;, &quot;just like Jesse James&quot; and &quot;After all&quot; next to Peter Cetera.&quot;Heart of stone&quot; became Cher's first multi-million selling album, it sold over 3 million copies in the Us and it's her best selling after her 1999 smash album &quot;Believe&quot;.Some of the song in this album were written by Diane Warren, one of the best song writers of all times, she writes song for singer such as: Michael Bolton, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.Other hits of this album are &quot;Kiss to kiss&quot;, &quot;Love on a rooftop&quot; and the tittle it self.

I like very much Celine and I have to admit that I was very excited and impressed because this production was released even before the end of her Las Vegas engagement, but then when I purchased it, I became disspointed because I found that there were several songs missing.This album contains very few of Celine's hits. You can find "IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW", "BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME" and "MY HEART WILL GO ON" but others like "A NEW DAY HAS COME", "IF YOU ASK ME TO", "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST", "THAT'S THE WAY IT IS" are missing, why?. Besides several of the songs of her two latest albums "A NEW DAY HAS COME" and "ONE HEART" are missing and both albums have wonderful and powerful songs. On the other hand I have to say that Celine's energy on stage is very strong and that she added to this cd covers like "FEVER", "WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD" and "NATURE BOY". Then I'm glad that Celine also sings "I'M ALIVE" a song that for me it's her best even tough it went nowhere in the charts. About charting, this album debuted at #10 on Billborad's Top 200 albums but disappeared very fast.So to make a long review short. I think that Celine is very talented, I like her very much but this album whether came out very fast or wasn't very well produced because it could have been way much better because there was material to make it better and finally about the 2 brand new studio tracks, I think that they're ok but didn't become hits because they didn't have more promotion.

When the whole rumor about this movie started I wanted to see it right away, so when I got the chance to see it I didn't hesitate to see it and I couldn't even finish it. This movie is only about the pain that Jesus felt, there's nothing more than that. You are not going to see other parts of his life. Only blood and punishment. OK we all know the story and know that it was terrible but come on make a film of more than two hours only to show that?!?!?!?!. I really feel that the only reason why this movie was made it's because it's a story that everyone knows and of corse it's very good and interesting.I'm sorry, lots of people must think that this is an excellent movie but I totally find it disgusting, there's no respect to the religion and the producers simply wanted to make money with a "masterpiece".I know that money makes the world spin and with this I'm not saying that I don't like money. I love money but we have to respect somethings in life.And by the way, now I understand how that old woman died in a theater when she saw this bloody movie and the sad part of this is that I'm more than sure that the Academy will award this movie with all the Oscars. And to fishing this review, I think that the Catholic Church must say something against this movie.

Although she only has 2 albums ("Not that kind" and "Freak of nature"), this beautiful and very talented singer has broke all record sellings in Europe, selling 10 million copies with only 2 cd's in the market.Her appearance in the U.S was last year and her only official single "One day in your life" bearly touched the charts. But the funny part is that everyone who listen one of her songs, simply loves it. The whole thing is that she doesn't have a big promotion on TV shows or radio stations.This DVD includes her 10 video collection, with songs like "I'm otta love love" which was her first single. The song is very good, is a dance song such as "Not that kind", "I was made for loving you", "One day in your life" (Directed by Dave Meyers), "Boom" (the official song of the 2002 FIFA organization) and "Why'd you lie to me" that is a very good video.You'll also find the video of the first single from "freak of nature", "Paid my dues" and finally you'll find the ballad videos from her songs "Cowboys and kisses" and "You'll never be alone".With the special features, includes remixed videos, behind-the-scenes and a special about Anastacia, between others.

After the big, big success of her 2001 cd &quot;Desahogo&quot; that contains one of the biggest songs of 2002 &quot;Quitame ese hombre&quot;. Pilar comes back with &quot;Pilar&quot;. An album that follows the same direction but with a more mature Pilar. The first single &quot;Prisionera&quot; (Prisoner) is very good and you can hear it in 3 different versions. Norte&ntilde;a, ballad and pop.Between the songs you can find a song in English (&quot;Love is all you need&quot;) which sounds very good and could easily be released to chart on Billboard's Hot 100, considering that &quot;Quitame ese hombre&quot; was so big in the Latin American charts that it also climbed in the Hot 100.If you don't know very much about Pilar's music, I can tell you that she has a good voice and her musci can go from Pop to Norte&ntilde;a.

After the sad episode that Anastacia lived last year when she discovered that had breast cancer, she took a time off to recover and now is back stronger than ever.Anastacia is not very known in the U.S but in Europe and Asia is one of the hottest singers. Her two previous albums sold more than 10 million copies and brought Anastacia several Top 10 singles including "I'm outta love", "Cowboys and kisses", "Paid my dues" and "One day in your life".Her American debut happened in 2002 with "One day in your life" as lead single. The song and album had a moderate success but I'm more than sure that it wasn't stronger because there was not a big promotion.Now about this album. It debuted at #1 in the European charts and stayed there for several weeks leaving behind strong albums such as Norah Jones's "Feels like home" (which is amazing) and Prince's latest album.The first single "Left outside alone" climbed the charts very fast arriving also to #1.If you know about Anastacia's music. I can tell you that this one is very good as her previous ones but it has more rock influences. And if you don't know about her music, think about a mix between Tina Turner, Taylor Dayne, Billie Myers and Evanescence.Finally I can say that the album is very, very good and if you like one of the singers that I've just mentioned, you'll simply love it (check the songs "Season's change", "Left outside alone", "Sick and tired", "Heavy on my heart", "Pretty little dum dum" and "Maybe today".

I've seen almost all J.Lo movies and I think that the only good ones are: "Selena", "Enough" and this one because "The cell" and "Angel eyes" were simply terrible. Her performance in the movie is very good, she's funny and lovely.Her role is of a divorce woman with a son. She works in a luxury hotel in New York and one day she's cleaning a room and her son arrives with a candidate to the Congress (Ralph Finnes) because he wants to go out with the candidate's dog. Jennifer was wearing an elegant suit from one of the guests (Natasha Richardson-who happends to be the best influence of the movie with her very good and funny character as a millionaire who is desesperate to get married). So Ralph Finnes thinks of Jennifer as an important business woman and he want's to see her again and there starts the chain of problems that makes this movie so funny.Once again I must say that the performances of J.Lo, Ralph Finnes and Natasha Richardson are very good.You' ll love this movie which it's considerate as the new Pretty Woman.

I have her albums "Christina Aguilera" and "Mi reflejo" and I like them very much. So when this tittle came out I bought it (we had to wait for a while)nowadays there are many young singers but Christina has the best voice without question.I tittled this review like this because of corse who has this album and has also Christina's first you can see more influences of hip hip and R&B; on this one but it's worth it because her voice is so good that see can sing salsa and it's gonna sound great.This album has a great production, has 20 tracks, The second track "Can't hold us down" has a special appearance by Lil'Kim and in the first single "Dirty" appears Redman.As I said the first single was "Dirty" it became an instant hit all over the world and the video is very good eventhough it had some negative critics. The second single was "Beautiful" which I think is her best work so far. The song reached #2 on The Hot 100 of Billboard.The album already had been certified Platinum x2 in the U.s and the selling is being good all over the world.

When a cd wins several awards or sells millions of copies doesn't mean that it's the best work of a singer.&quot;My love is your love&quot; is one of Whitney's latest albums and for me it's her best. This production didn't have the impact of &quot;The bodyguard&quot; or her 1987 hit release &quot;Whitney&quot; but it also had a good experience on the charts. It was a Top 15 album, sold 5 million copies worldwide and its singles; &quot;It's not right but it's ok&quot;, &quot;My love is your love&quot;, &quot;I learned from the past&quot; and the biggest one, &quot;Heartbrake hotel&quot; next to Faith Evans and Kelly Price were hits.There's also a duet with Mariah Carey. The song is the theme from &quot;The Prince of Egipt&quot; that was nominated for an Oscar in the Best song for a movie category, back in 2000.This album was considered as Whitney's comeback (it was actually her first new studio album after her 1990 &quot;I'm your baby tonight&quot;) and it had a different direction. Whitney adds more hip-hop sounds.

This is the first book I've read by John Grisham and I found it very good. The story is thrilling.It's about a lawyer who claims his death, he burns his car and after everybody thinks he's dead, the steals 90 million dollars.The F.B.I hires a guy who has people to find him and they do, but that's just the start of this big story that I strongly recommend it, really, read it.

From all the TV shows that search for singers like American Idol. David Bisbal is the only one that has found success internationally. Clay Aiken and Kelly Clarkson are big in the U.S but outside they're not very known.David's first album was a very big success which sold almost 2 million copies and made David win a Latin Grammy."Buleria" is very good, from my point of view I like more his previous album but this is also very good.The first single "Buleria" went straight to #1 in Spain and became a Top 10 hit in the U.S (the album debuted at #5 in the U.S). From the rest of the album you have some ballads and David's classic beated up songs. The lyrics are very good also, the album was produced by Kike Santander one of the most talented producers in the Latin market and you can find a more mature and secure David.If you don't know about David's style, I can say that his similar to Luis Miguel (let's not forget that David once said that Luis Miguel was his role model) and also his voice is similar.

Alejandro has an amazing and versatile carreer singing two types of music. Rancheras and pop. Personally I don't like rancheras but I have to admit that he sings them very good because of how he delivers the songs and because of his voice."A CORAZON ABIERTO" (With open heart) is a purely pop album loaded with very good songs including "ME DEDIQUE A PERDERTE" which was the first single and had a very big success in a America and Spain. You can find that track in pop and salsa versions. Other great songs on this album are the heartfelt "QUE VOY A HACER CON MI AMOR", "QUE LASTIMA" and most chilled up "CANTA CORAZON".The album was produced by Kike Santander who happends to be one of the best producers in the Latin Market and besides being the procer, he also wrote several songs for the album.You should give it a try and listen this cd because is very good.

I love Tina Turner, she's an incredble singer who has everything, style, voice, rhythm and incredible legs."Simply the best" is called one of the best years greatest hits albums. It was realesed in 1991 and includes some of Tina's greatest hits (I say some because actually there are a couple missing), it also includes 4 new songs (by 1991), one of them is a duo with Rod Steward. This album debuted at #1 in the British charts and remainded in the Top 50 for 3 straight years, the album was certified Platinum in the US and Multi-Platinum all over Europe, selling almost 10 million copies.The songs are:1-THE BEST.The song made to #1, was nominated for a Grammy and it's considerated a classic.2-BETTER BE GOOD TO ME.Reached #5 in 1985 and won a Grammy award.3-I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN.Reached #4 in Europe.4-WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.A #1 hit that was the best song of 1984 and won 3 Grammy awards.5-I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU.A hit in 1990 peaking at #6 in the British charts.6-NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS (the 90's version).Written by Tina in 1973, the song made it to #23.7-WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE.From 1986, the song reached #14 in 1987.8-LET'S STAY TOGETHER.This song opened the market walls in 1984 after her divorce, the song was a big hit, getting a Grammy nomination and peaking at #3.9-RIVER DEEP-MOUNTAIN HIGH.From 1966, this song was written by The Beatles songwritter/producer, Phil Spector.

I really enjoy listening to this group because of several things. I really like the idea of the dramatic lyrics such as "no me dejaste otra opcion que arrancarme la piel y aguantar el dolor" (you didn't give me a choice but to tear my flesh and bear the pain) on "PARA NO DECIRTE ADIOS" or "ahora que te vas yo te guardo un sentimiento porque se que no es correcto dejar nuestra vida atras. Ahora que te vas, ahora que te veo marchar, antes debo confesarte que has dejado un plato sucio en tu lugar" (now that you're leaving I still keep a feeling beacuse I know that isn't right leave our lives behind. Now that you're leaving, now that I see you walk away, before that I must confess that you left a dirty dish on your place) on "AHORA QUE TE VAS" I really feel Natalia giving her best on lines like this. Then Natalia's voice is very good, she has a great voice and she performs flawlessly.I really liked "FLORES DE ALQUILER" their previous album that made them known and gave them the international success that they they needed to continue with their career. "EL MUNDO SE EQUIVOCA" follows the same direction and has the same quality. The first single "TU PEOR ERROR" is a great song that had been a big success along Latin America, Spain and the U.S.From my point of view the best songs are "TU PEOR ERROR", "AHORA QUE TE VAS", "PARA NO DECIRTE ADIOS", "NADA" and "COSA DE DOS". Check the album it is really very good.

I have every season of The Simple Life and I have enjoyed the first seasons until season 4, when Paris and Nicole had their feud. But even though they didn't work together the season was fine. So now that they got together again to make season 5, I thought that the show was going to be really funny. But I really found it not so funny. This time they go to camp and there are not really fun scenes. I think that one of reasons can be, that they are in another stage of their lifes. I mean they are in their late 20's so making stupid things (Let's be honest. The show was fun because they were always making stupid things. Funny but stupid) is not so funny any more. And the other I think, was that there was nothing exciting in the stories that they made for this season.I heard that season 5 is the closing season of the series. I think that it wasn't a good idea to end a show that had had success without closing it big.Finally I must say that the DVD production is not good at all. It doesn't have special features. You can only find the usual DVD enhancements such as scene seletions or subtitles (this one includes subtitles in English, Spanish and French).If you are a follower of the show, buy this one but if you want to buy a season for any reason. Try the first three seasons (the best ones for me are season 2 and 3).

Cher is amazing her music has been successful for 40 years and now she wants to concentrate her career in movies. So for that reason she has made her last tour (which is her biggest and more successful)and because of that we have now her very first live cd.This cd was recorded in Miami (is the same show of the DVD concert). The show starts with the U2's &quot;I still haven't found what I'm looking for&quot; (Cher's version is better)and it's followed by the 2002 hit &quot;Song for the lonely&quot; and then comes the 1999 hit &quot;All or nothing&quot; and it keeps rolling with several classic hits.This cd is not only special becuase it's gonna be the last live one. It's also special because it contains each fraction of Cher's music sience her first solo hit &quot;All I really wanna do&quot; and her 70's #1 hits &quot;Gypsies, tramps and thieves&quot;, &quot;Dark lady&quot; and &quot;Half breed&quot;. There's also the 1978 Top 10 hit &quot;Take me home&quot;.From the 80's it has the Top 10 singles &quot;I found someone&quot;, &quot;Just like Jesse James&quot; and &quot;After all&quot; next to Peter Cetera.And of course her 2 biggest hits &quot;Belive&quot; and &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;.This cd is very special, if you like music and like to collect cds, this is a must have.&quot;The farewell tour&quot; cd has debuted in the Billboard's Hot 200 at #40.I'd also recommed the DVD from this cd. It's very good and has an amazing production.

CD 1 (The very best)The collection of songs here is very good, you'll find her biggest songs in just one cd which for me is very good because I hate albums that come in two discs. Because every time that you want to listen to one or other song you have to switch cds. The only two mistakes that I found with this collection is that they didn't add her 1987 Top 15 hit &quot;We all sleep alone&quot; and instead of that song you'll find &quot;A different kind of love song&quot; which is a good song but wasn't a hit and the other mistake is that &quot;Bang, bang&quot; appears in its original version. The new version from 1987 is much better.Some of the songs here are: &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Save up all your tears&quot;, &quot;Strong enough&quot;, &quot;I found someone&quot; and &quot;Take me home&quot;.CD 2 (Live, The farewell tour)Cher's Farewell Tour was very good, the songs were very good chosen and the show was very Cher.In this cd you'll find almost all the songs that she sang. The missing ones are &quot;Save up all your tears&quot;, &quot;A different kind of love&quot; and &quot;All sleep alone&quot;. Cher's voice and music are very good live. On the shows she sang in a medley her early hits &quot;All I really want to do&quot;, &quot;Gypsies, tramps and thieves&quot;, &quot;Dark lady&quot; and &quot;Half-breed&quot;. That's the version that you'll get of those songs in this cd.There's nothing left to say about this cd 'cause we all know Cher (whether you love her or hate her).The only thing that I'd recommend is to buy the Farewell Tour DVD.

We all know that Cher is one of the most important figures in show business. The had won a Grammy award and an Oscar.When it comes to music we can say that she's one of the best and this cd is a reflex of that success.In this cd we find her whole music history of hits from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's.From the 60's we it has hits such as: &quot;I got you babe&quot;. From 70's &quot;Dark lady&quot; and &quot;Take me home&quot;. From the 80's &quot;I found some one&quot; and &quot;If I could turn back time&quot; and her lates hits like &quot;Belive&quot; or &quot;Song for the lonely&quot;.But I also must say that to hits are not included here and those are &quot;WE all sleep alone&quot; (I can't understand why they didn't add it when it was a hit and Cher sang it in all her concerts. It's a pitty) and &quot;Walking in Memphies&quot;. I like all the songs in this album and love them but I'm rating it with 4 stars because they didn't add &quot;We all sleep alone&quot;.

Mariah did have tough times during the last years but that's all behind now with this album that is a proof that she still has control and credibility. "THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI" was produced by Mariah and Antonio "LA" Reid (in my opinon he's one of the best producers nowadays). And follows Mariah's style that goes from blues to pop and hip hop. A great combination that next to her delightful voice make an incredible mixture. The album brought Mariah back on top and I think that this happened this time because she was more relaxed and took time to do it right. "CHAMBRACELET" was a good album but it didn't have the strength that this one has. Just comparing the covers you can sense the different directions. The first cut for this album was "IT'S LIKE THAT" a very catchy song that is followed by "WE BELONG TOGETHER" which is a hip ballad. You go on and on through amazing songs and very good guests which are Snoop Dogg, Twista and Nelly. If you like Mariah you won't be sorry at all with this production. The two first singles which are Top 20's plus the dubut of the album at #1 on Billboard 200 (where it stayed several weeks on the Top 5) aren't fluke. Well actually I do't think that because an album sells millions of copies is better but this time shows an emancipation. Check the songs "STAY IN NIGHT", "CIRCLES", "GET YOUR NUMBER", "TO THE FLOOR" and "JOYRIDE".

Finally we can buy a Greatest hits album from this fantastic singer. Here you'll find almost all her hits, I say this because &quot;Spanish guitar&quot; and &quot;How could an angel break my heart&quot; aren't here.This cd contains the following tracks:1- &quot;Give u my heart&quot; (with Babyface)2- &quot;Love shoulda brought you home&quot;3- &quot;Another sad love song&quot;4- &quot;Breath again&quot;5- &quot;Seven whole days&quot; (live)6- &quot;You mean the world to me&quot;7- &quot;How many ways&quot;8- &quot;You're making me high&quot;9- &quot;Let it flow&quot;10-&quot;Un-break my heart&quot;11-&quot;I love me some him&quot;12-&quot;I don't want to&quot;13-&quot;He wasn't man enough&quot;14-&quot;Just be a man about it&quot;15-&quot;Hit the freeway&quot; (with Loon)16-&quot;Whatchu need&quot; (new song)17-&quot;The little things&quot; (new song)18-&quot;Un-break my heart&quot; (remixed version)Toni has released 5 studio albums in her career. The first one was in 1993 with the tittle &quot;Toni Braxton&quot;. The album won 3 Grammys and was certified Platinum x8 (sold 10 million copies worldwide). The second album was &quot;Secrets&quot; from 1996. The album was also certified Platinum x8 (sold 12 million copies worldwide) and won 2 Grammy awards. Then after some troubles with her label Toni released &quot;The heat&quot; in 2000. An album fresher than her first 2, once again Toni released a hit, the album was certified Platinum x2 in the U.S (sold 4 million worldwide) and won a Grammy for the song &quot;He wasn't man enough&quot;.In 2001 Toni released a holliday album called &quot;Snowflakes&quot;. The album was certified Gold.So finally in 2002 &quot;More than a woman&quot; came out (for me this is a very good cd) but eventhough the album was certified Gold, it went nowhere, the only single &quot;Hit the freeway&quot; only reached #86 in the Billboard's Hot 100. But really that doesn't mean that the album isn't good. Actually it has more hip hop but sounds very good. I think that the problem with that album is that it didn't have a good promootion and Toni was pregnant when it came out.

Kelis's third album "Tasty" is more than good. The first single "Milkshake" became a big hit peaking at #3 in Billboard's Hot 100. Actually the whole album is a hit. Kelis's voice is amazing, very sexy and the lyrics can go from sexual to romantic. The music style includes Hip Hop, Rock, Pop and R&B.; The production of this album is purely first class with producers indluding The Neptunes and Andr&eacute; 3000 (Outkast)."Tasty" also includes some special guests like Nas and Andr&eacute; 3000. If you liked the smash #1 hit "Hey ya!", you'll like track #8 ("Millionaire") that was produced and includes the participation of Andr&eacute;. The song follows "Hey ya's!" same direction.In my opinion the best songs in the album are "Milkshake", "Keep it down", "In public", "Protect my heart" and "Attention". The Intro is also very good.I'd recommend this album's explicit version.

This is one of those movies that you can see several times and never get tired of it. The cast it's amazing featuring Mark Wahlberg (The yards), Charlize Theron (Sweet november), Edward Norton (American story X), Seth Green (Austin Powers) and Donald Sutherland.The story is about a robbery in Venice and one of the members of the group (Edward Norton) decides to go his way with all the gold that they stoled, by taking posetion of the gold worthed 34 million he kills the master of the group (Donald Sutherland) and thinks that the rest of the team is also dead.So one year after one of the members (Mark Walhberg) decides to look for the master's doughther (Charlize Theron)and tell her that he had paged the killer of her father, so the whole team plus her who happends to be an expert in safes (if you see that movie you'll know why I'm saying this) start a plan to recover the gold as revange of the dead of the "master" of the group.This movie has wonderful locations like Venice and the streets of L.A, has a lot of action with some scenes sparked up with comedy.If you didn't know Michael Caine acted on the original version back in 1969.Once again I say that this movie is great, for my opinion it's one of the best releases of this year ... I strongly recommended.

I don't think that there's someone who doesn't know one of Barry's songs. He's voice was incredible, the lyrics fantastic and the rythms amazing.This collection includes his best best songs until 1975. You'll find here classics like the #2 "What I'm gonna do with you", the #1 "I'm gonna love you just a little more", the 1974 #1 hit "Can't get enough from your love" that actually returned to the Top 20 in 1993 performed by Taylor Dayne. Another song that was also covered was "Never, never gonna give up". The song was covered in 1997 by one of the most important singers in the U.K, the great Lisa Stansfield. The song made it to #3 in the U.K (performed by Lisa) and Barry took it to #1 in 1973 in the U.S.My personal favorite song is the #2 "You're the first, the last, my everthing" the song is simply incredible.This Greatest Hits version has been certified Multi-Platinum in the U.S and even though Barry recorded more albums in the 80's and 90's this one conteins the essencial.

I think that fusion is one of the best things that a person can do in almost everything, and personally I think that what Bose did for this biggest hits album, couldn't have been better. Because re-releasing the same old songs in one format is nice but doesn't give anything new. But re-releasing them with a fresher sound and next to some of the most successful singers in the latin field, that's simply flawless."Papito" includes duets with Julieta Venegas, Ricky Martin, Paulina Rubio, Alejandro Sanz, Juanes, Alaska and Shakira between others. Most of the songs sound better now in a duet but I have to admit that others sound better on their original version. Like for example "NADA PARTICULAR" next to Juanes. I like Juanes and have most his albums but his voice sounds simply horrible. He is the kind of singer that sounds good singing music with more background sound. The song was killed actually (hear the original version and I think you're going to agree with me). Talking about Miguel's talent or the talent of the guests is senseless because everybody knows about that. But there are two things that I must recall. One is the "comeback" of Sasha Sokol (from Mu&ntilde;ecos de Papel) and the very impresive performance of Bimba Bose (Miguel Bose's niece). This girl is very good looking, has a great voice and really performs very good. Actually "COMO UN LOBO" where she sings is I think one of the best songs of the album if it isn't the best.This album has found big reception everywhere. In Spain the album debuted directly at #1 and stayed there for several weeks. In the US the album reached #6 on the Top Latin Albums Chart and #160 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums List. The single "NENA" (next to Paulina Rubio) has been so far the biggest hit of the album becoming a Top 10 latin hit and recieving a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year.This is a great album, if you like Bose I think that you're not going to dislike it at all.Yo creo que la fusi&ograve;n es una de las mejores cosas que alguien puede hacer, y creo que para relanzar tus mejores canciones en un disco recopilatorio, puede ser lo mas divertido. Para "Papito" Bos&egrave; se une junto agrandes de la musica latina como Paulina Rubio, Juanes o Alejandro Sanz y la verdad es que las canciones suenan muy bien (algunas la verdad suenan mejor en versi&ograve;n original. Como es el Casa de "NADA PARTICULAR". Me gusta la musica de Juane pero la verdad es que su voz en esta pista simplemente no suena nada pero nada bien). Hay dos cosas que debo remarcar sobre "Papito" y es la vuelta de Sasha Sokol (de Mu&ntilde;ecos de Papel) y la gran impresi&ograve;n que me di&ograve; Bimba Bos&egrave;, sobrina de Miguel. Esta chica es muy guapa y adem&agrave;s canta muy bien y su voz la ayuda mucho. "COMO UN LOBO" donde ella canta es tal vez la mejor canci&ograve;n del disco. Este album ha tenido mucho &egrave;xito en todos lados. En Espa&ntilde;a ha sido #1 por varias semanas y en Estados Unidos debuto en el #6 de los Top Latin Albums y en el #160 de Los 200 M&agrave;s Importantes seg&ugrave;n Billboard. El sencillo con m&agrave;s &egrave;xito ha sido "NENA", junto a Paulina Rubio que hasta recibi&ograve; una nominaci&ograve;n a un Grammy.Solo puedo decir que si te gusta Bos&egrave;, este disco te va a gustar mucho.

I always liked Michael Bolton and bought some of his tapes (at that time cd's were just starting in my country) I kiked them but I never loved them. So in 1996 I saw this cd and bought it and I really love this one. It has great songs, big hits like: "Steel bars", "When I'm back to my feet again", "Said I love you but I lied", "I found someone" and others.Michael Bolton is a good singer but besides this album being a greatest hits it's the best because actually his latest albums were made by covers.I think that Michael should make a good cameback, he has talent and a good voice.

This album is from 1996, before the strong hit of "My heart will go on", maybe we can say that Titanic's song it's Celine's best (me personally I don't think so, the song is good but it was ALL day long in the radio stations) well as I was saying, this album has also big hits as the Top 10 "It's all coming back to me now" an INCREDIBLE song or "because you loved me" which won a Grammy award. Another great song is "You make me feel like a natural woman" I think that I don't need to say that this is a cover from A.Frankling. "Call the man" was a hit in 1997, the impact of the album was incredible, it won Grammy awards, sold nearly 20 million copies, topped The Hot 200 and charted for 150 weeks.My personal favorite songs from this album are: "It's all coming back to me now", "I love you", "Because you loved me", "If that's what it takes" and "Falling into you".Celine Dion is a great singer, maybe the world's best, but as a person who has her whole English discography, I think that "Falling into you" and "A new day has come" are her best albums.

I have to admit that this is one of the best shows that I've ever seen in my life. I really felt in love with the girls of "SEX AND THE CITY" and although lots of people compare "DH" with "SATC". I believe that they're very different. "SATC" was fun, crazy and with some touching moments but this one has mistery mixed with drama and comedy.The story from this show, starts with the suicide of Mary Alice a woman who lives in a nice and quiet place called Wisteria Lane. This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things togetehr about her suicide but nothing matches. While they start getting information you have the change to know them very well...Susan (Teri Hatcher) is divorced, has a teenage daughter and is the kind of woman that everything happends to her and is always between embarrassing moments. She lives kinda depressed until one day she meets a new neighbor who she happends to like very much. Then there's Lynette (Felicity Huffman), who has 3 little boys and a baby girl. She used to be a successful executive but after her marriage she became a housewive. Her kids drive her crazy and her husband is always travelling.Bree (Marcia Cross) is an obsessed woman who likes to have everything perfect in her life and happeneds to be so cold with her husband sometimes that that got her to the edge of a divorce. Her two teenagers also have a bit acid reltionship with her. Finally there's Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) who seems to have the prefect life. She's married and her husband instead of giving her his full attention, he simply buys her whatever she wants. Diamonds, cars, etc. She feels empty and she has an affair with her gardener.The husbands also happend to have desperated lifes also.Many things happend during this first season. The production is very good, the cast is flawless and the episodes get better and better.This package is loaded with lots of bonus features including deleted scenes, secrets of Wisteria Lane, Oprah Winfrey as a neighbor, behind the scenes and much more.Touchstone is really breaking all the records with this successful series and "LOST" another series that I really recommend, it's different but very good also.

Just knowing that actors like Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton work together just makes you feel sure to buy or see the movie.As soon as this movie came out I bought it and found it very good. Their performances in this movie are flawless (Diane Keaton won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar) and I also think that they made the perfect couple for the story.The story is about an ungry and solitary , successful writer (Keaton) that goes to her Hamptons house for the weekend with her sister without knowing that her doughther (Amanda Peet) was also going to be there with her much older boyfriend (Nicholson). They all stay in the house even tough Erica (Keaton) didn't like Harry (Nicholson) at all.The story has a twist when Harry almost suffers a heart attack and has to stay in Erica's house because the doctor (Keanu Reeves) recommended Harry not to go back to New York.And well to make this short and to not tell you the whole story so you can see it. Harry in Erica fall in love and Harry's doctor also falls in love with Erica and there are some other twists in the movie and make it very interesting.I also like this movie because shows how &quot;old&quot; people can also fall in love in a very cool way.

I have bought some Mariah's cd's through the years and this year I bought the original release of "THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI" because I found the first single "IT'S LIKE THAT" very good, but I never played the whole cd. Later I heard "WE BELONG TOGETHER" and found it even better than the first one. That song has been a very, very big hit reaching #1 for 13 or 14 weeks on Billboard's Hot 100. With that success plus the third single "SHAKE IT OFF" that peaked at #2, came this re-release of "THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI" and that's when I started to listen to the whole cd.With this new package you get a DVD with four videos ("IT'S LIKE THAT", "WE BELONG TOGETHER", "SHAKE IT OFF" and "GET YOUR NUMBER", which was released only in EU). The DVD also gives access through internet to the video of the video "DON'T FORGET ABOUT US" and never before seen interview of Mariah (I've only seen the 4 videos). I think that to have access to these features through internet is ridiculous but...The requirements that new need for these are:1. A computer with a DVD drive and internet access.2. Windows 98SE or higher with Internet Explorer 5.5 or higheror Mac OSX with Safari and Internet Explorer for Mac 5.0 orhigher.3. Windows Media Player 7.0 or higher.The cd features the same songs of the original version plus 3 brand new songs, including the heartfelt new single "DON'T FORGET ABOUT US" plus a remix of "WE BELONG TOGETHER" featuring Jadakiss and Styles P. Personally I like more the original version but the remix is not bad.If you don't have the album, I really recommend it if you like Mariah or her style. Try the songs, besides the mentioned singles. "SAY SOMETHIN'" feat. Snoop Dogg, "MINE AGAIN", "CIRCLES", "TO THE FLOOR" feat. Nelly and "FLY LIKE A BIRD" and "ONE AND ONLY" feat. Twista. The whole album is good actually but I think that these are the highlights.

This four girls are simply fantastic and I can't really understand how can this year they're going to film the last season. I heard the reason is because Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have another baby and she wants to spend more time with her children. I'm happy for her but she could do both things as other artists do. HBO should make at least a Sex and the city movie.The fifth season has a different direction because the girls had grown and they live different experiences like Miranda that now has a son, Charlotte is getting divorce from Tray, Samantha felt in love for the second time in the series and she forgives her parter after that she discovers that he had cheated on her and finnaly Carrie, Carrie now is alone and she gets the change to write a book about her column.The fifth season has only 8 episodes but they're are fuuny and intresting as always.

I bought this album back in 1997 and actually I don't know why i bought it I think that was that I saw on cable the &quot;you're making me high&quot; video and I saw in a store and bought it.This album is amazing the lyrics are beautiful, there's no a song that I don't like, the rhythms are very good also and besides that I like this album it was one of the biggest hits of 1997 with song such as: &quot;you're making me high&quot; (my own favorite) the song did it to #1 in the Hot 100, Hot R&amp;B song and Club dance charts another hit and maybe Toni's biggest song &quot;un-break my heart&quot; is also in this album &quot;Un-break&quot; became also a #1, another great song is the soft &quot;how could an angel break my heart&quot; were features Kenny G.Here's also one song from the 1996 hit soundtrack &quot;waiting to exhaale&quot; the song is &quot;let it flow&quot;. Actually I love all the ssongs in this album from the first one &quot;come on over here&quot; until &quot;I the late of night&quot;.This album won 3 or 4 Grammy awards (I'm not sure about the amount)and sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

It's been a decade since this album was released and we can still hear several songs on the radio such as: "another sand love song" which was the first single of the album, was certified Gold in the US, won a Grammy award for "best female pop vocal performance" and became a #1 hit. The second single, "breath again" was also certified Gold, became also a #1 hit and won a Grammy award for "best female pop vocal performance" in 1994, the success of the song was so big that Toni also realesed this song in spanish, the tittle was "respirar", the third single "seven whole days" was also a hit, the song made it to the Top 10 as the fifth single "you mean the world to me", the sixth single which was "how many ways" was a Top 40. Thanks to this hit singles and the song that was part of the "Boomerang" soundtrack. That was Toni's first single ("love shoulda brought you home").This album sold 10 million copies world-wide (was a #1 in The Billboard 200 for 2 weeks) and brought Toni the 1993 Grammy "Best new artist" and showed the world the new treasure that was in the music market.Actually I didn't buy this album when was realesed, I bought it in 1997 when Toni's album "secrets" was on its top and because I liked so much "secrets" I decided to buy this one and I know that "secrets" is the sequel of this album with very good lyrics.I can also say that this production was produced by hit singer/song writer/producer Babyface ("Waiting to exhale", "Boomerang" between other soundtracks) and Antonio L.A Reid (producer of singers like Pink or Avril Lavigne).You won't be soory if you buy this album and besides, it's a classic.Good work Toni!!!.

I like Shakira's music most of the time. Even tough I have her whole cd collection (the ones that you can find in stores because her first and second are impossible find). Not all were for me good. "PIES DESCALZOS" next with "FIJACION ORAL Vol.1" are the best.In 2005 after being tired of hearing her ALL THE TIME on radio or TV I bought "Fijacion ORAL Vol.1" and I must say that I was impressed, the cd was really, really good, so of course when the second volume was released I bought it without hesitation but this time I wasn't very thrilled and I think that also the public had the same feeling for the cd as I did. The cd debuted on Billboard's Top 200 albums at #5 where it peakd and flopped very fast in almost every music chart. The first single "DON'T BOTHER" was good but nothing special and didn't make either an impression (Top 50 on Billboard's Hot 100). From my point of view the best songs on the original version were "HOW DO YOU DO" a very strong song that sounds very good along with "ANIMAL CITY", the English version next to Cerati of "DIA ESPECIAL/DAY AND THE TIME" from the Spanish cd and finally the biggest track for me, "ILLEGAL" featuring Santana on lead guitar. In overall the cd sounds weak and maybe Shakira or her record company noticed that and along with the poor selling they decided to re-release the album with a new song that made the album see brightness for a brief moment with the mega hit "HIPS DON'T LIE" one of the biggest singles of 2006 but that wasn't enough to keep the album from falling again to the darkness. The third single "ILLEGAL" went nowhere and that's a pity beacuse of the great track it is but I think that the reason why it didn't hit was because even tough Shakira has a great voice, that doesn't mean that you don't get tired of listening it and "HIPS DON'T LIE" was good for her but it also made people tired of her voice. Maybe this happends to me beacuse I live in a country that speaks Spanish and I've been listening to her music non-stop ever sience "LA TORTURA" which is a very good song and I believe that it's going to be a classic.Anyway, I think that the album is not that good really, just a couple of songs are good. If you speak Spanish I would recommend "FIJACION ORAL Vol.1" or "PIES DESCALZOS".

The first time that I heard about Mary was when I bought the "Now 9" cd in april 2002 and my favorite song was "Family affair" so I bought this album and let me just say that this album is great, songs such as: "Family affair", "Love", Rainy dayz" or "No more drama" can really make you feel Mary's gift for music.This album hitted the charts twice, the first time was when the first edition was released, it debuted at #2 and the second edition came out 8 months after peaking at #14, both were certified Platinum x2. Mary also won a Grammy in 2002 for this production.If you like to dance I strongly recommend Mary's remixes cd "Dance for me".

When someone who doesn't know her very well, hears her name can only think about the 1989 world hit "All around the world" which was a #1 in Europe and a top 10 in the US.But she has lots of good songs that are not known in the US. This album is the example of that. This title came in the market in 1997 and it's considerate her second best album, the first single was the #1 european hit "The real thing" a real good dance song, this one was fallowed by the Barry White's cover "Never, never gonna give you up". That song was a hit in the US which made it to the Top 40. If you don't know very much about her is because you leave in the US (I say this because if you were in Europe or Asia you'd know her) I can say about the album on the market that was certified Gold in the US and multi-platinum in Asia and Europe.Lisa's voice is very good, she mixes modern music with a touch of disco, and pop. The lyrics are very good, she has songs by Diane Warren (who writes songs for singers as: Cher, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton between others) Lisa is also a producer in this production next to her husband a very famous british producer.If I could compare Lisa to another singer, I would say that could be Taylor Dayne with Christina Aguilera's voice.

It's almost impossible not to remember Taylor Dayne. She released several hits in the 80's and this cd it's a proof of that.Some of her biggest songs are her Top 10 singles; &quot;Tell it to my heart&quot;, &quot;With every beat of my heart&quot;, &quot;Don't rush me&quot;, &quot;Say a prayer&quot; and her #1 &quot;Love will lead you back&quot;.She also had several Grammy nominations and 2 of her albums were Platinum x2.One of my favorite songs in this album is the cover from Barry White &quot;Can't get enough from your love&quot;.I strongly recommend this cd. It's been a long time but I still enjoy Taylor's music.If you like her music you'll also like Anastacia, who has her style and voice.

Shakira is a wonderful singer she has a very strong voice and with this adventage you can do almost everything.The first time that I heard from her was back in 1996 when she was enjoying the first hit of her career, her smash hit &quot;Estoy aqui&quot; and I had the change to go to one concert of her in my country and I also had the change to meet her.During the years she had realesed several albums from all of them I like the most 1996's &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; I've heard this album I don't know how many times and I still enjoy it when I hear it, she didn't make it bad in 1998 when she realesed &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot;, this album from my point of view was been made through the vision of &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; but it had to be better so the producer was Emilio Estefan Jr. one of the most important producers in latin music but the album became too comercial and this happends all the time and also happends with movies that had been blockbusters and the they make the sequel and it's not the same, but in this case the difference was that the album became a hit and sold more than &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; but the reason of this wasn't because just of the album were the influences of the producer, Shakira was more famous and her MTV unplugged was was the last touch to that success, talking about the MTV unplugged, Shakira realesed a cd from that unplugged and let me say that the quality of voice of Shakira was better but the production was a mess, was terrible I mean was the re-realese of her album &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot; because she sang all the songs from the album and &quot;estoy aqui&quot;and she left behind lots of hits such as: &quot;donde estas coraazon&quot;, &quot;antologia&quot;, &quot;un poco de amor&quot;, &quot;pies descalzos&quot; and &quot;Se quiere-se mata&quot; for me that's the worst MTV unplugged in the hole history maybe the producers can say that was good becuase of the sales but I insist the production was a mess.In 2001 as everybody knows she realesed &quot;Laundry service&quot; her first english album I like this album, the singles are the best songs, Shakira's prononciation is not very good but she did it alright.My final thought is that Shakira is very talented but she needs better producers and know that she is famous all over the world and had sold albums as ice- creams in summer it's time fror her to think about her production and not just to sell and sell albums just &quot;making them&quot;.I rate this CD with 3 stars because it has a good quality and has good songs as: &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Whenever, wherever&quot;, &quot;Underneath you clothes&quot;, &quot;Poem to a horse&quot; and &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot;.And i think that the translations from the covers are better good because it's not and easy or sometimes possible work.

It took Paulina a while to release a new cd but I think that it was worth the wait. This versatile singer comes back with "ANANDA" that follows her big success of "PAU-LATINA" in the sense of music fusions and sevaral types of music but this time I feel that Paulina has leaned more on rock music instead of her famous rancheras with a touch of hip-hop. Electric guitars are strongly present on tracks such as "NADA PUEDE CAMBIARME" that has Gun's n' Roses's Slash on lead guitar. This song is one of the highlights of the album. In the case of "MIENTEME UNA VEZ MAS" Paulina follows the direction of Evanescence, this song has the very same style of their music and sounds very good with Paulina's voice.Even though Paulina has concentrated more on rock, I also feel that she wanted to release something for everybody. But this is easy to understand because of group of people that she has chosen for this production. She has the style of Coti with the Ballad "AYUDAME". A mix between Coti and Julieta Venegas on "QUE ME VOY A QUEDAR" which is a catchy song but honestly the lyrics have no sense. She also had Junes as songwriter on "NO TE CAMBIO" this song is really good because it starts the first verse with flamenco and then starts a very nice combination between a very soft reggaeton, a bit of ballenato, pop and hip-hop a real gem for the album. The song that has the biggest ranchera style on the album is "AUNQUE NO SEA CONMIGO" but doesn't have a strong influence as "DAME OTRO TEQUILA" or "EL ULTIMO ADIOS"."ANANDA" also has pop songs like "RETRATO", "N.O" and the first single "NI UNA SOLA PALABRA" written by Xabi San Martin from Spain's La Oreja De Van Gogh. Comparing this album with her previous one "PAU-LATINA"...well I think that "ANANDA" is very good I really enjoy it but "PAU-LATINA" was more solid, maybe I think this because I heard it more and I got more used to it. The one thing I wanted not to find again is the interludes after each song, they're really short but unnecessary. A positive thing about this production, is the booklet because it has several pictures and lyrics.To finish this review I think that even though the critics for this album were not very positive. I think that it's a very good step for Paulina. The first single became a #1 hit in the U.S for several weeks and #2 in the main chart of all Latin America and gave Paulina her third entrance on Billboard's Hot 100 with a song that wasn't in English. The album debuted at #1 in the U.S on Top Latin Albums list and #25 on Billboard's 200 and became #1 also in several territories and sold up to 500,000 copies on its release week. Anyway, this is just commercial information but I think that the album is good maybe not her best but good, you won't be sorry with it if you like her music.

I think that it was a good idea to release an enhanced version of ANANDA. The orginal cd is very good but it doesn't include all the extras of this version. On this deluxe version you can find:1-Music videos ("NI UNA SOLA PALABRA" and "NADA PUEDE CAMBIARME")2-An interview with Paulina (it's not long, it takes around 10 minutes but it's fun).3-Behind the scenes footage. This is divided in two parts. The first part is about behind the scenes of both the music videos on the DVD that aren't special because are really short and Paulina barely comments about them and the director doesn't make any comment either. And the sencond part which is about a rehearsal prior a show in Malaga, Spain.I say that this is a great deal because for an extra bucks you will get the DVD with this features plus on the cd you'll get a bonus track that doesn't appear on the original version of "ANANDA" which is "ME SIENTO MUCHO MAS FUERTE SIN TU AMOR" and two new versions of "NI UNA SOLA PALABRA" and a new extra version of "NADA PUEDE CAMBIARME".If you like Paulina and you have this album on the simple version, you'll like it because of the 2 videos which are the strings to pull this deluxe version. And if you are willing to buy "ANANDA" because you wanted to have it, well I can say that this is a very good album that follows Paulina's style of mixing several types of music including Pop, Rock, Ranchera, Flamenco influences between others. The first single "NI UNA SOLA PALABRA" became an instant huge hit all over Latin America, Spain and even countries such as Italy where it made a big impression. Between the producers you can find Cachorro Lopez one of the most important producers in the latin market and C. "Tricky" Stewart who produces of singers such as Madonna or Britney Spears. Juanes and Julieta Venagas wrote songs for Paulina, on the lead guitar of "NADA PUEDE CAMBIARME" Paulina had Guns n' Roses's lead guitarist Slash.This album also sold up to 500,000 copies on its release week and topped almost every latin album chart. Well these are only commercial facts. The album perse is very good. Check "NADA PUEDE CAMBIARME", "N.O", "AYUDAME", "RETRATO" and "MIENTEME UNA VEZ MAS".

Besides being a sign, "Libra" is also balance and that name is perfect to describe Toni's career at this time. After "More than a woman" which from my point of view was a great album but the critics were negative, Toni comes back with this production which has what I call the two faces of Toni Braxton (her earliest generes Pop, R&B; with a slide touch of Hip-Hop and her newest which was mainly Hip-Hop on her previous release). The result is very impressive and with Toni's voice any kind of music is going to sound flawless. What I have to admit is that her record company is not making any effort about promoting this album. The first single "PLEASE" went nowhere and I also have to say that the production is not the best because the album has only 10 tracks and the booklet doesn't include lyrics. From all this you can notice how big is Toni's background and credibility because the album debuted at #4 on Billboard's 200 and #2 on Billboard's Top R&B; and Hip-Hop albums.Anyway that's just my opinion but to focus on the music. I would recommend the songs "PLEASE", "FINALLY", "TRIPPIN'", "WHAT'S GOOD", "I WANNA BE" and "TAKE THIS RING" which has an incredible rhythm and Toni's perfromance is great. The album was produced by Toni, Keri Lewis (Toni's husband), Vincent Herbert, Jomo Hankerson and Barry Hankerson. I really miss here L.A Reid, Babyface and Diane Warren. They should always be on Toni's productions.You should give a shot to this album, it's not Toni's best but it's pretty good and let's hope that Toni gets back to the big success that she used to have.

It's almost impossible to be Latin and don't know the song "Color esperanza". A song that was aired all over Latin America and Europe.After his 1999 hit album "Tal cual es" which included the Top 10 U.S hit "La ultima noche". Diego took two years to release "Un mundo diferente". An album with the same direction as his previuos with a mix of pop and tropical rhythms but with a more mature and confident Diego Torres.The first single "Sue&ntilde;os" was a hit fallowed by the biggest hit of the album; "Color esperanza". Then came "Que no me pierda" a song that it's impossible to miss in a discotheque, with all this hits the album was nominated for an American Grammy Award in 2002.Now in 2004, three years after its release the album is still strong and now with Diego's MTV Unplugged. Diego is going to be considerated as one of the most important singers in music industry.My favorite songs on this cd are "Color esperanza" (Hope's colour), "Conmigo siempre" (Always with me), "Sue&ntilde;os" (Dreams), "Que no me pierda" (Don't let myself lost), "Alegria" (Joy) and the bonous track "A traves del tiempo" (Through time).

This is an amazing cd. Ray's voice and style were amazing and considering that he sings with other amazing singers such as Norah Jones, Elton John and Natalie Cole. Just make the cd a must have. I really love listening to it while writing or being around the house because it makes a lot of company, just relaxes me.This cd made a big impact with multi-million selling status and a bunch of Grammy awards.It's really difficult to make a review from this album beacuse there's not much new to say because we all know about Ray. The last thing that I can say is that the album is very good and you could give it a try at least listening to the samples so you can make a decision whether you add it to your collection or not.

I must say that I had an enormous expectation for this movie. It was sold out everywhere and I heard that it was fantastic. So I finally got it and went straight home to see it and in the beginnig I was excited and the minutes started to pass and nothing funny was happening. So after one hour I started to skip the scenes to see something good but actually never happened.This movie doesn't have a strong argument, it's supposed to be unrated but I never saw a scene with something &quot;unrated&quot;, it's terrible it has some good ideas but the directores and producers didn't know how to develop them.I strongly DON'T recommend this &quot;movie&quot;.

After reading Tina Turner's "I Tina" book, and watching the movie, I can say that the director did a very good job to adapt 45 years to just two hours. I can also say that some important facts of the book were worth to add to the movie. But well, in overall it's very good how they did it.Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne did a very good job also as Tina and Ike Turner. Not for nothing they were nominated to an Oscar. Angela Bassett won the 1993 award for this work.The main comment that I would like to do about this movie, is that it's almost shameful that the special features are almost none. Even the VHS version offered more than the DVD. It at least included the video of Tina's "I don't wanna fight" a smash hit that was the theme of the movie. There are several cut scenes and work next to Tina that are not on this DVD. I wish they release an anniversary edition or something with more material.For that ones that don't care about anything extra, I can say that the movie is very good and intense. It was one of the biggest movies of 1993 and the critics were really good. It is really worth it to watch this one. Tina's life from the dark Ike days to her emancipation was really hard and I also think that the movie can teach you a lesson that many things are possible in life.

La Ley is one of the most important groups in Latin Music. The've won 2 Grammy awards and their latest singles became hits. That's the reason why they were called to make this unplugged.The production is very good, they had selected their best song and also made some arrangements. They also made new songs like: "Mentira" and "Intenta amar". They also made a duet with a mexican great singer called Ely Guerra.If you don't know very much about La Ley I can say that their music is a soft rock type and if you know them I can only say that this is their best cd.

Pilar started her career in the early 90's with a group called &quot;Garibaldi&quot; that had a big hit for a while, she's also known as an actress but her previous cd's as a solo singer really didn't do it in the international market.But &quot;Desahogo&quot; (Relief) has nothing to do with it. The album is full of success. The first single &quot;Quitame ese hombre&quot; (Take away from me that man) became a #1 hit for several weeks in the US and other countries including Spain. The hit of the song was so big that it also charted on The Hot 100 that it's actually for songs in English. It reached #72.&quot;Desahogo&quot; has been certified Platinum x2 in the US and Mexico and Platinum and Gold in other countries.Pilar's music is pop and she also sings some tropical mexican music that sounds very good on this beautiful woman.

I never heard about Robi Draco Rosa (even though I'm a music lover and know a lot about music) until I saw one of his videos and found it good. So I bought this cd and from the moment it started I heard it all the way until the end (and that sometimes is hard because when we buy a new album we just listen to the more known songs), and the whole album seemed to me excellent.Robi's style is very particular. He makes a very interesting fusion of styles from pop, jazz, rock and soul. He's voice is similar to Ricky Martin's but personally I think that he's way much better than Ricky.Between the best songs you'll find &quot;Dancing in the rain&quot;, Mad love&quot;, &quot;Solitary man&quot;, Heaven can wait&quot;, &quot;Try me&quot; and &quot;California&quot;.If you like this new music that it's coming out with fusions, I'm sure that you'll like this cd very much.

Fantastic soundtrack with incredible singers featuring the Top 20 &quot;Not today&quot; sang by Mary J. Blige Feat. Eve, Mya's hit &quot;Fallen&quot; (the &quot;Fallen&quot; video was chosen by MTV as one of the 20 best videos of 2003). Here you'll also find songs by Outkast, Eve, Sleepy Brown, Keyshia and many more.If you like the style of any of this singers, don't doubt about getting this soundtrack, it's really good.I'd also recommend the following cd's:*Mary J.

Rosario is one of the most important singers in Spain, she was in the biggining famous because of her family (her mother, Lola Flores was one of the famous singers in Spain as well as her father "el pescailla" and her sister Lolita and her brother Antonio) her first album back in the late 80's was a modest hit, but in 1995 she started her good way with her hit "estoy aqui" the song that made her famous out of Spain as a singer, then the following album was also a hit with the hit single "que bonito" a song dedicated to her brother how die only one week after her mother in 1995.2001 and 2002 had been incredible years for Rosario with her multi-platinum hit album "Muchas flores"."Muchas flores" brought her, her first Grammy award thanks to hit like: "al son del tambor", "como quieres que te quiera", "agua y sal" and "muchas flores" all this songs were #1's in Spain, because of the big impact of the album that sold 400,000 copies in Spain (incredible sales for Spain because a Gold album is given for 50,000 copies and Platinum for 100,000) the album was also realesed in countries of different languages such as Italy, Germany or France.Even though the album has been an international hitI like it very much because of the rhytms which are a mix of gypsy music and pop and the lyrics are beautiful.

I bought back in 1992 the vhs edition of this collection I found it very good. So this year when I saw the dvd I bought it thinking that I could find differences but nothing!.This dvd is the same as the vhs, there's absolutely nothing new, they didn't add different versions of some videos or put special features.I can't also understand why when this collection was made the producers didn't put the original videos of &quot;Typical male&quot; and &quot;We dont need another hero&quot; or why doesn't appears the video of &quot;Way of the world&quot; wich was a Top 3 hit single in the U.K and Europe.The videos for &quot;Typical male&quot; and &quot;We don't need another hero&quot; are taken from her 1991 video &quot;Do you want some action-live in Barcelona&quot;. Tina's strengh on this videos is amazing but this is a video collection so they should have added both versions for the dvd. There's also one hit video missing from 1987 the Top 20 hit &quot;Two peolple&quot;, so where's this video? nowhere because you can't even find it any more because the vhs is out of stock.There're some other fantastic moments taken on video as the duet that she made with Bryan Adams or some of her Vegas shows that are not here.How ever Tina is wonderful and I hope that Capitol or Virgin releases a new dvd as Tina and we her fans deserve.One more thing, there're some great videos that are out of stock now and could be re-released. The tittles are: &quot;Wild lady of rock&quot; (1979), &quot;Private dancer tour&quot; (1985), &quot;Break every rule&quot; (1986), &quot;What you see is what you get&quot; (1987) and &quot;Whats' love live&quot; (1993). I strongly recommend the first and the last, if you can find them somewhere get them.

After the release of her first album, &quot;Gracias&quot; (Thank you), when she was only 15 years old. Tamara came back with this, her second album in 2001.With &quot;Gracias&quot;, Tamara reached a high status in International music with her hit &quot;Celos&quot; (Jealousies) and her selling amounts.This time she releases an album with her own music (80% of the songs from &quot;Gracias&quot; were covers). Bebu Silvetti produced and directed the whole album and also wrote some of the songs.The first single was &quot;Siempre&quot; (Always) a song with good lyrics and sound. The song became an International hit.Other songs what are known from this album are: &quot;Herida de amor&quot; (Hurt by love), &quot;Todavia&quot; (Not yet), &quot;Es nuestra despedida&quot; (It's our goodbye) and my personal favorite, &quot;Si faltas tu&quot; (If you're missing).Tamara was only 17 years old when she recorded this album but if you wouldn't have known this, you would have thought that she was 25 years old because her voice is very strong and it's difficult that a 17 year old girl would sing ballads.

I've seen this movie like 50 times and everytime that I watch it makes me laught out of control.You may know Peter Sellers from the classic movies &quot;Pink Panther&quot; from the 60's.&quot;The Party&quot; is about an indian actor (Sellers) that comes to America for a leading role in a movie but he's so clumsy that ruins a whole location. So when the director calls the boss to inform him about the mess that had been made, he writes Hrundi's (Sellers) name in the guest list of a party that he was having at home.When Hrundi arrives to the party finds out the his white shoes are dirty with car oil so he cleans them in a water canal of the house entry making him loose his shoe. Then he gets bored because anybody knows him, so he starts to talk to the people but they're not interested in him so he explores the house while making disasters. Then he doesn't even have a place in the dinning table and well I can tell you that he goes from that to ruin the master's room bathroom.Honestly if you buy this movie you won't be sorry AT ALL, it's not very long and you can listen to it in English, French and Spanish.

I never thought that her previous album &quot;Glitter&quot; was a mess, it was maybe in the commercial way but the songs were good, not her best, but they were ok.I also think that singers when sell extremely good for some many years, arrives the time when the selling is going to be smaller and that happened with singers like Micahel Jackson or Whitney Houston, so Mariah had her time in the 90's, she's a great singer, her voice is unique but I find very difficult that she'll recover her past status.I found &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; with good work and dedication but I can't compare it with albums like &quot;Butterfly&quot; or &quot;Emotions&quot;.The first single &quot;through the rain&quot; which was a modest hit (it peaked at #83) is very good, actually the remix version is better.There are very good songs in this album like &quot;The one&quot;, &quot;Yours&quot; and &quot;Irresistible&quot;.

I'm glad that Lisa has now a greatest hits album. This English fabulous singer who has sold up to 13 million copies worldwide gives us this great gift adding songs like: &quot;All around the world&quot; a 1989 hit that reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold and its album Multi-Platinum thanks to only one song. Other hit singles from Lisa are: &quot;Never gonna give you up&quot; (cover from Barry White which was an instant hit in Europe, the US and Asia), &quot;The real thing&quot; (a 1997 hit which reached #1 on the Club Dance Songs from Billboard), &quot;Someday I'm coming back&quot; (from the multi-million selling soundtrack &quot;The bodyguard&quot;), &quot;People hold on&quot; (another #1 hit all through Europe), &quot;Let's just call it love&quot; (from her latest studio album &quot;Face up&quot;).Lisa is a singer who goes through pop, rock, ballads and disco music. She says that Barry White is a big influence in her career.&quot;Biography&quot; includes a bonus cd which features remixes and extra tracks such as: &quot;The line&quot; (from her 1997 hit album &quot;Lisa Stansfield&quot;), &quot;8-3-1&quot; and &quot;Never gonna fall&quot;.

Anastacia is a woman with an incredible voice, she's a mix between Tina Turner and Taylor Dayne, but she has her own style."Not that kind" it's her first album which was released in 2000.This album wasn't promoted in the US, only the cut "I'm otta love" was able to chart on Billboard's Dance Club House (I don't remember the peek but was high). The song used to be played on pubs and some station but Sony decided just to promote her in Europe.In Europe Anastacia is considerate one of the most important singers, selling millions of copies (this album sold 5 million throughout Europe)her singles top the charts and her concerts are crowded.Anastacia's songs are great, her love songs have great lyrics and her feeling is deep. When she rocks, she rocks an example of some great dance songs are: "I'm otta love", "Not that kind", "You're tripping", "I was made for loving you". Some of her love songs on this album are: "Black roses", "One more change" and "Cawboys and kisses".Anastacia seems to have it all, support from big stars such as: Michael Jackson, Destiny's child, Madonna between others, a great voice, the looks and a unique talent.I'm sure that if you buy this album, you're gonna buy also her second and latest, "Freak of nature" which has the 2002 smashing international hit "One day in your life" and a duet with Faith Evans.2002 was a very good year for her, "Freak of nature" sold also 5 million in europe and its total selling amount it's around the 7 million, she happened to be the singer of the 2002 official song of the Fifa football world competition.But 2003 started not so good because Anastacia discovered that she had breast cancer, but thanks God her doctors detected this on time and now she's recovering to bring us her third album.

I'm writing this review right after I have finished watching it, and I can only say that I have no word to describe the movie but disaster. It's very boring but the speacial effects are good though.The movie is about an attack of some monsters in Manhattan and there is a guy that records with his camera the whole thing. I know that there are several movies like this and they really called my attention at the time I saw them (even when I'm not a fan of science fiction movies) I liked them.The cover really says something completely different of what the movie is. Another thing that I must say about the movie is that it desesperates a little bit because the image is not steady, it is always shaking and you can't see the scenes very good.If you are a disaster movie fan maybe you can like this one but if you're not I doubt you are going to like it.

Whitney may had been one of the most important singers in the 80's and 90's with incredible sellings and hits like &quot;I'll always love&quot;, &quot;I wanna know&quot; or her latest hits from 1999 &quot;My love is your love&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak hotel&quot;. But this latest work is nothing compared with her past works. The album has good songs like &quot;One of those days&quot; or &quot;Whatulookinat&quot; but the rest in not good at all.This is the first time that Bobby Brown takes credits in one of her albums and the answer is not good.As an example I can say that not only in the taste of her public but in the charts the album went nowhere it debuted at #9 but dropped very fast, it only recived Platinum status which is good for any singer but if we compare her charting and selling history we can say that this album hasn't been a hit at all.It seams that wen singers sign a new record deal they get nerviuos or just don't work as hard as they did, because we have 2 examples of that, Mariah and Whitney.

This guys from Mexicali are back with this, their second album. I found it better than their first self-titled that was really good. And I can also feel a more mature group and better production. But the only thing missing for me on this album, is a cacthy song as the Top 20 hit "QUE VIDA LA MIA". The song that can be compared to that one is "NO SE PORQUE TE VAS" a really great song. In overall "SECUENCIA" follows the same roots of "REIK" which is for the ones who don't know much about Reik. A mix between pop and R&B;, but they also sometimes touch rock like is the case of "SIN CONOCERTE" or "DE QUE SIRVE" but it's soft rock don't imagine something like AC/DC or Guns and Roses. The first single "IVIERNO" became a hit all over Latin America and reached #2 on Billboard's Latin Pop Airplay but even though they have success in Mexico and Latin America I wonder why they aren't bigger because they have all it takes. Talent, good lyrics and the vocalist has a very good voice.Check the songs "SABES", "SIN CONOCERTE", "INVIERNO", "NO SE PORQUE TE VAS" and "VIVO EN SUE&Ntilde;OS". Personally my favorite songs are "NO SE PORQUE TE VAS", "INVIERNO" and "ME DUELE AMARTE".

It's undeniable that she's the queen of merengue. After 9 hit albums, Grammy awards, Billboard awards, #1 hits and Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum albums she gets back on the charts.&quot;Sobrevivir&quot; is an excellent album with lots of rythm, mixing all the way through the album dance songs and ballads.The first single, &quot;asi es la vida&quot; toped the US charts and in several territories.Olga's voice is unique she has an incredible strengh when she sings and she really can make you dance.This album has been certified Gold only 3 weeks after its release.Olga goes goes through merengue, flamenco and ballads in this album, she also made a duet (on this album) with hit latin singer Luis Fonsi.I only have 2 albums from her (&quot;Yo por ti&quot; and &quot;Sobrevivir&quot;) they're both great and made me love her and think of her as the best merengue singer.

It's been over ten years sience Ricardo Arjona is in the business and during that time I heard all his singles and they are all very good but when you buy his cd's and listen to all the songs you or in my case won't find them all good.Ricardo is a poet/singer, his music can go from a very good pop or even rock song sometimes to a very depressing one. The lyrics are very good, they are direct, strong and even romantic.The best songs in my opion on "Santo pecado" are "El problema", "Minutos" (the best in my opinion),"Santo pecado" and "Dame".I may rate this cd with only 3 stars an might sound not optimistic but those couple of good songs are enough to buy the cd.This edition contains a VCD with a special of the making of "Santo pecado".

This is an incredible production from some great hits of the 80's converted to Jazz. The song selection is very good and what it's amazing is that some of the songs sound better than the originals, this cd is very good to play any time you want to feel relaxed or it's great to play it as background music in a reunion with friends or at the office. Finally another highlight from this production is that the singers are pretty good, something that is very hard to get when you buy a cd with covered songs from other singers.Check how good sound Madonna's "LIKE A VIRGIN", Prince's "PURPLE RAIN", Culture Club's "DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME", U2's "WITH OR WITHOUT YOU" and Guns n' roses's "PATIENCE".

Tina Turner is the female singer that has sold more tickets in music history with her strong voice and her wild dancing.In 2000 she announced that her "24/7" was her farewell tour so she went out on tour for a whole year.This DVD was taken at Wembley Stadium (England) where Tina simply rocked the place. The show starts with her 70's hit "I wanna take you higher" a song that she didn't sing during her 80's and 90's tours as some other hits like "A fool in love" and "Acid queen". In my opinion she did this show fantastically adding those songs and the covers that she added like Marvin Gaye's "I heard it through the grapevine" where you can see fantastic artworks like the stage opening and burning, and Ottis Redding's covers "Try a little tenderness" and "Sittin' on the dock of the bay". "Addicted to love" is also here as in all her concerts and of course her hits like "River deep-mountain high", "Private dancer", "When the heartache is over", "Whatever you need", Proud Mary", "Nutbush", "Better be good to me", "What's love?" and "We don't need another hero". One of the best performances is "Let's stay together" where she sings delightfully and I can't miss "The best" where you find the show's climax.Even though the selection of songs was very good I feel that some hits were missing like "Typical male", "Two people" or "I don't wanna fight". On this show you won't find "Steamy windows" but one the secong leg of the American Tour she changed "I heard it through the grapevine" for "Steamy windows".About Tina's whole performance I can say that it's fantastic she simply performed as a tiger on stage and about the quality of the DVD I can tell you that it's very good, the images are clear and the takes are very good. Don't forget that Emmy award winner David Mallet directed this show.With the special features you can behind the scenes and you can select the sound.If you like this video you may also like Tina's "Simply the best-The video collection" or "Wildest Dreams Live in Amsterdam". You can also find "Rio 88" which was a good show at the Maracana Stadium in front of 182,000 people but the image is dark.

Jessica Simpson never called my attention until I saw her video &quot;Sweetest sin&quot; on the &quot;Now that's what I call music DVD&quot; and found it good and bought her cd &quot;In this skin&quot;. So around this time &quot;With you&quot; was released and I simply found it very, very good. Jessica's voice and the rhythm are perfect.Well about the edition of this CD Single, I think that it's kinda poor because it doesn't contain any remixed version or the song's video but the song it's so good that I gave it 5 stars.You won't be sorry with this purchase.

After her hard battle with cancer, Soraya comes back full of strengh, great songs and success...the first single from this production &quot;Casi&quot; (almost) has been a hit in the U.S and Latin America. The song delivers an important message about life, faith and reality with lines such as: &quot;Is this a nightmare?, it can't be true, I wake up with a landslide and I start to slip, I've almost lost my faith, I've lost strengh to keep fighting&quot;, that was her feeling when she knew about her illness.The rest of the songs are great, like &quot;Solo por ti&quot; (only for you) which is a beautiful ballad or &quot;Sin explicacion&quot; (without explanation) which is a fusion of pop and flamenco. There's also an acoustic version of &quot;Casi&quot;.This production has several rhythms and wonderful lyrics.If you don't know much about Soraya I'd say that she's one of the most talented singers in the Latin Industry, her style may not be very commercial but she has many hits such as: &quot;Derrepente&quot;, &quot;Avalancha&quot;, &quot;Si te vas&quot; and &quot;En donde estas?&quot;. Her first cd was recorded and realesed in England where she had a big impact with her cd in English.I think that would be fare if she wins a Grammy for her song &quot;Casi&quot;.

With her two first albums Joss has found big success in Europe and modest in the U.S with her exquisite voice and music. A mixture of pop with r&b;, soul with a funky touch (several talented singers are more successful in Europe than in the U.S. Some names are Anastacia, Seal or even Tina Turner. I think that this happends because there's a huge influence of hip-hop in the U.S, with this I'm not saying that I don't like hip-hop). Anyway, on this DVD you will find songs from both her albums SOUL SESSIONS and MIND, BODY & SOUL. The show starts with Joss's first single SUPER DUPER LOVE, a great song followed by JET LAG rolling until you get to YOU HAD ME, a great song that was nominated for a Grammy this year. Other hightlight tracks are RIGHT TO BE WRONG, FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY, SPOILED, THE CHOKING KIND or DON'T CHA WANNA RIDE?. Her live performance is great, her voice is very strong as it sounds on her cd's and she also has charisma.The special features on this DVD are also very good. You can find the videos of FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY, SUPER DUPER LOVE and YOU HAD ME plus never-before-seen mini-documentary filmed while travelling through Europe and the U.S. and some out-takes.If you like Joss, this is definitely a must have.

I love this album, I think I've heard it like 1,000 times or more. I bought it back in 1996 when Shakira wasn't know and I felt the album very acustic and simple but full of love, with lots of interest and feeling.Now after 7 years I have Shakira's whole discography and any of her other albums haven't reach the quality of this one. Ok I know that now she sales millions of cd's and all that but this one is her best and anybody who knows her from back then will share the same opinion.This album features her first hits like: &quot;Estoy aqui&quot;, &quot;Antologia&quot;, &quot;Un poco de amor&quot;, &quot;Quiero&quot;, &quot;Pies descalzos&quot;, &quot;Donde estas corazon&quot; and &quot;Se quiere se mata&quot;. Each one of the singles became a hit.If someone doesn't know her from back then won't feel the change on her as a person. She used to be a lovely person but know she's serious and her feet are not any longer on the ground.I highly recommend this album it's beautiful. It's her best without doubt.

From my point of view the Grammy nominees or winners selection are not always the best but we will never know what's behind the real selection. This cd is very good but some songs don't have the level to be even nominated. You can compare this album and the rest of the ones of this category with the popular "Now" series. They're all very good but thre's has to be a difference in what you put on the Grammys.Almost all the songs here charted on Billboard's Hot 100 and the albums from this songs were certified whether multi-platinum, platinum or gold.What I like about this album is that you can find all kinds of music from R&B; to Rock and even Soft Opera. The songs that I like the most are:1-"HERE WE GO AGAIN" (Ray Charles and Norah Jones)*This song won the record of the year award and it's really good.2-"SUNRISE" (Norah Jones)*Norah is a great performer and now she has 8 Grammys and they're very well deserved.3-"DAUGHTERS" (John Mayer)*Won a Grammy for song of the year. John is a very talented singer.4-"BURN" (Usher)*This singer was the sensation of 2004 with big hits. This song is very good. What I found very good this time from the Grammys is that they're not giving lots of Grammys to "Impact" singers. Let's face it, Usher is good but it's known that when his next album comes out it will go nowhere comparing it with this one. Look what happened to singers like JaRule or Shaggy.5-"YOU HAD ME" (Joss Stone)*Very good song and fantastic singer. I feel sorry that she didn't win a Grammy.6-"SHE WILL BE LOVED" (Maroon 5)*One of my favorite songs of 2004, they took home the best new artist trophy.7-"LOVE'S DIVINE" (Seal)*This song wasn't very popular in the U.S but it was one of the best released in 2004.8-"IF I AIN'T GOYT YOU" (Alicia Keys)*She did it again, what a great song.9-"YOU RAISE ME UP" (Josh Groban)*Very talented singer that sings in English, Italian and Spanish.10-"MY IMMORTAL" (Evanescence)*I like this group and I think that this is their best performance.

It's not unusual that Celine releases an album every year, but I thought that after her 2002 release she was going to wait for a while to go back to the studio, but it didn't happend. 366 days after the release of "A new day has come", "One heart" appeared.This album has a bit of everything from the dance song "I drove all night" to the fantastic lyrics of the soft ballad "Have you ever been in love" which is a song from the "A new day" album that was added exactly one year after. There's another song from "A new day has come", the song is "Sorry for love" which was one of my favorites in the named 2002 album. This time that track has changed from being a dance song to a pop one. Both versions are very good. "One heart" is a very easy album to hear, has twists and the rhythms are delightful aswell as the lyrics.Wonderful pop songs in this album are: "Faith", "Love is all we need", "Naked" and "Stand by your side". If you feel like dancing you have songs like: "I drove all night", "One heart" and "Coulda, woulda, shoulda" and finally some of the love songs are: "Je t'aime encore" (which is in English) and "In his touch".This cd had been certified Platinum x2 only 3 weeks after its release, selling 300,000 copies on the first week and with that amount it debuted at #2.I strongly recommed this album, I have the whole discography of Celine and my favorite cd's are: "Falling into you", "All the way", "A new day has come" (my favorite) and this tittle.

I love this album, it has a different direction but it's still very good and Toni's voice it's incredible as always.I have her complete discography (including her 2001 christmas album "SNOWFLAKES" that was certified Gold-not bad for a holiday album) and as I wrote before this new album is different, it's more hip-hop, it has more beat and of course has ballads very usual in Toni's albums.If you don't know very much about Toni Braxton I might think that you only know songs like: "UN-BREAK MY HEART", "YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH" or "ANOTHER SAD LOVE SONG" but she has much more to offer us...In 1993 she realesed her first album "TONI BRAXTON" which sold 10 million copies between 1993 and 1994, brought Toni 3 Grammy awards including the 1993 "Best new artist" the album also had 2 #1 hits and other hits like "LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME" a song from the 1992 "BOOMERANG" soundtrack.In 1996 with her second album "SECRETS" happened the same thing, she sold 12 million copies and won 2 Grammy awards including also 2 #1 hits ("you're making me high" and Toni's biggest single "un-break my heart")one of the songs of this album was "LET IT FLOW" from the 1996 hit soundtrack "WAITING TO EXHALE" and "HOW COULD AN ANGEL BREAK MY HEART" where features Kenny G.After almost 4 years away from the studio Toni realesed "THE HEAT" in 2000, this album brought Toni one more Grammy for the hit "HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH"."THE HEAT" debuted at #2 in the Billboard 200 and became multi-platinum.Toni has gone from old to young not only in her look but also in her music, her first two albums were more nostalgic and serious but since "The heat" she has changed a bit her direction and with this new album she show us that she is MORE THAN A WOMAN.Toni is a producer in this new album next to (all time Toni's producer) Pink's producer L.A Reid and Toni's husband Keri Lewis.Everyone might ask: Where's Babyface?.But it's a great album.

After her Multi-platinum, Grammy award winner album &quot;Muchas flores&quot;. Rosario returns to the top with this very good album.&quot;De mil colores&quot; (&quot;Of 1000 colors&quot;) follows the same direction of &quot;Muchas flores&quot; with her very known fusion of styles such as flamenco, pop and rock. The songs in this album are very good, the lyrics can be touchy, happy and even funny as track #10 &quot;Los tangos de mi abuela&quot; (My grandma's tangos), which is my favorite song here it has lots of energy that makes you feel like dancing and the lyrics...the lyrics are great with lines such as: &quot;Mi abuelita tenia una olla, la metia debajo la cama y en la olla no se lo que hacia que la convertia en bola infernal&quot; (&quot;My grandmother had a pot, she use to put it under the bed and I don't know what she did with it that became like a ball of fire&quot;) this might sound stupid but when you hear the song, sounds very good.There are also love songs such as: &quot;Viviras&quot; (&quot;You'll live&quot;), &quot;De mil colores&quot; (&quot;Of 1000 colors&quot;), &quot;Como tu&quot; (&quot;Like you&quot;), &quot;Atado a esa mujer&quot; (&quot;Tighted up to that woman&quot;) with Antonio Carmona (main singer of &quot;Ketama&quot;). The funky ones are: &quot;Vueltas&quot; (&quot;Spins&quot;), &quot;En mi casa&quot; (&quot;At my place&quot;), &quot;Aguanta ahi&quot; (&quot;Hold it there&quot;) and &quot;La vida es un sue&ntilde;o&quot; (&quot;Life's a dream&quot;).This album was released in november 2003 in Spain and became an instant hit, debuting at #1 and selling hundred thousands records on it's release week.I strongly recommend this album. You may also like very much her previous work &quot;Muchas flores&quot;.

I think that when a greatest hits album is released, there are always going to be different points of view because you're not going to find everything you were looking for. But I think that this album has a very good direction. It mainly captures Tina solo hits (From the Ike and Tina era it only includes "PROUD MARY", "RIVER DEEP-MOUNTAIN HIGH" and "NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS") from her 1983 comeback hit "LET'S STAY TOGETHER" going through hits such as "PRIVATE DANCER", "BETTER BE GOOD TO ME", "WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER HERO", "TYPICAL MALE", "TWO PEOPLE", "THE BEST", "STEAMY WINDOWS", "I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU" to her latest US Top 10 hit "I DON'T WANNA FIGHT", which happened to be the theme of the movie made of her life in 1993. Then you can find Tina's latest hits that were big in Europe but in the US they didn't make it to the Top 10. Songs from this era that started in 1995 with the theme of James Bond's "Goldeneye", you have the track "GOLDENEYE" and singles from her 1996 smash "WILDEST DREAMS" album that brought her hits such as "MISSING YOU", "SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL REMAINS" or "SILENT WINGS". Finally from her latest studio album to date you have "WHATEVER YOU NEED" and "WHEN THE HEARTACHE IS OVER" and her hit duets "IT'S ONLY LOVE" next to Bryan Adams and "COSE DELLA VITA" with Eros Ramazzotti.There are some hits missing in this recopilatory like her 1985 Grammy winning track "ONE OF THE LIVING" which is a song that you can't find on any Tina recopilatory. If you are looking for it, you have to buy the Mad Mad Beyond the Thunderdome Soundtrack. Then her 1992 hit "WAY OF THE WORLD" or even "WHATEVER YOU WANT" which was the first single from the"WILDEST DREAMS" album. The producers must had added this songs intead of "GREAT SPIRITS" which wasn't a even a single or "IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS" or "WHY MUST WE WAIT UNTIL TONIGHT?", singles that are very good but didn't reach the success of the others. Refering to "IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS", it's a pity that you can't find the version next to Barry White that was much better than the one with Antonio Banderas.For this album Tina recorded 3 new songs which are different but they all show that Tina even being 65 when she recorded them, still has her unike strengh when she sings. The new tracks are "OPEN ARMS", "COMPLICATED DISASTER" and the soft and relaxed ballad "SOMETHING SPECIAL". Other highlights from this album is that you can find the original and extended versions of "THE BEST", "LET'S STAY TOGETHER" and "BETTER BE GOOD TO ME" and that for "PROUD MARY" they chose the re-recorded version from 1993 and for "NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS" you can find the orinal version from 1973 which is better that the 2 new versions from 1991 and 1993.That was just my point of view for this album but I think that it's worth it every penny and is simply a must have because captures a big part of a music legend.

Eros Ramazzotti is the best-selling italian singer. During his career he had made several hits and had worked with singers like Tina Turner, Cher and Andrea Bocelli.This cd conteins his biggest hits by 1997 when it was released.Some of the biggest hits on this album are: &quot;Terra promessa&quot;, &quot;Adesso tu&quot;, &quot;Ma che bello questo amore&quot;, Musica e&quot; and &quot;Piu bella cosa&quot;.For this production Eros re-recorded his hits. &quot;Musica e&quot; was this time recorded next to Andrea Bocelli and &quot;Cose della vita&quot; with Tina Turner. The song is amazing. They rock together.There's also a new song in this album that it's very good. I'm talking about &quot;Quanto amore sei&quot; (How much love you are).The only advice I'm gonna give about this album is not to buy the Spanish version. The Italian is much better, even though Eros sings good in Spanish.

Alejandra really knows how to make music and this cd is a proof of that.The production starts with her 1994 hit &quot;Mala hierba&quot;, the song sounds better than the studio version. Then comes one of the biggest hits of 1990, this song also gave tittle to her best selling cd, I'm talking about &quot;Eternamente bella&quot;.Ale added almost all her hits, except the one of her latest cd of those days; &quot;Cambio de piel&quot;.The best songs are: &quot;Loca&quot;, &quot;Despertar&quot;, &quot;Te esperaba&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Mirala, miralo&quot;.There's an acustic set for her hits: &quot;Llama por favor&quot;, &quot;Rosas rojas&quot; and &quot;Cuidado con el corazon&quot;. There're also new songs like &quot;No hay vacuna para el amor&quot; and she invited for this occasion one of the most important voices of Spain; Miguel Mateos.If you like soft rock or Alejandra, don't wait any longer honestley, get this one.

Alejandra Guzman is known as the "Queen of rock" in the latin market.She started her career in the late 80's and since then she had made hits.In 2001 she released "Soy" (I am) an album with an ambitious production. Featuring Desmond Child (producer of singers like Cher) and Randy Cantor.The first single "De verdad" (Truly) became a hit in Latin America. Followed by the second, also the hit "Diablo" (Devil)."Soy" includes a good selection of songs like "Quiero vivir" (I want to live), written specially by Robbie Williams for Alejandra; the ballads "Volvere a amar" (I will love again), "Abrazame" (Hug me) and "Lluvia" (Rain) sound very good in Alejandra's voice.The most rock n' roller song is "Diablo" the other ones like "Todo" (All), "Labios de fuego" (Fire lips) or "Caramelo" (Candy) are basically pop tracks.I have some cd's of the Alejandra's collection and I feel that she used to be more rock and roller, now her music is softer, with her style of corse but not as in the early 90's."Soy" is a certified Gold and Platinum production and won a Grammy in 2002.I recommend the songs: "De verdad", "Quiero vivir", "Todo" and my personal favorite "Vagabundo corazon" (Vagabond heart).

I think that this production is one of the best released in 2004 and it's still going very strong. After "HARDER TO BREATHE" that made it to #18 on Billboard's Hot 100 plus "THIS LOVE" and "SHE WILL BE LOVED" that both peaked at #5 (also on Billboard's Hot 100). Now they just won the 2004 Best new artist Grammy and their fourth single "SUNDAY MORNING" is also climbing the charts.This guys have a great talent while performing and writing their own songs. I would find it very difficult if I have to compare this group with another because is very unique. If you don't know very much about their music. It's a mixture of rock with pop.

Everybody knows that Cher is one of the best singers ever. After many cd's and years of work she still releases hits.After her 1995 album &quot;A man's world&quot; that was a very soft album. Cher appeared again in the market in 1998 with this album. Her best album (I like this album very much, but it's not my favorite. My favorites are &quot;Cher&quot; (1987), &quot;Heart of stone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Love hurts&quot; (1991)). I mean her best in the commercial way.It was certified Platinum x4 in the US and sold 7 million copies worldwide.The first single &quot;Believe&quot; was an international #1 hit. Followed by other hits such as &quot;Strong enough&quot;, &quot;All or nothing&quot;, &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; and &quot;The power&quot;.Cher added to this work her 1987 hit &quot;We all sleep alone&quot; but this time had more dance influences.The direction that Cher took this time was dance music and she really did it great.Cher also won her first Grammy ever with this cd. So you have to &quot;Believe&quot; that this cd is fantastic.

Once again I'm impressed with Marta Sanchez, it took her 5 years to release a new studio album and she simply made up the years with her talent.After her 2002 release "SOY YO" that was more orientated to ballads, now Marta comes back with a much fresh album without leaving behind her flawless ballads talent (a big example here is "CONTRADICCIONES"). The album starts with "LEVANTATE" a song filled with energy, after this track you find "SI ME CAMBIAN LOS RECUERDOS" a song that personally I think must be considered a classic because Alaska joins Marta on this bitter track. Going through the album's slide there is "SUPERSTAR" the leading single which is simply great. It has Depeche Mode's backing music from the 80's song "JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH" Marta simply dazzles with track, this song became an instant hit in Spain. Track 4, "REINA DE LA RADIO" is a pure pop track. "DESAFINADOS" is not one of favorites but it still doesn't take any score from the album.On this production Marta wanted to dedicate two tracks, the first is "FRIDA Y SUS FLORES" which she dedicates to Mexico's biggest painter, Frida Kahlo and "TIENES QUE VIVIR" a beautiful song for her daughter. A big highlight of the album is "EMBRUJADA" where features Tino Casal (they made a very good job to add his voice to the song). Then "HIGH ENERGY" is another club style song that marks more the freshness of the album. Just by looking the cover you get the message.In overall "MISS SANCHEZ" is really good,it was produced by Carlos Jean and it was even nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. Marta's voice is simply amazing, she really knows how to perform and as I always say, Marta is a real professional and her music is impeccable. I wish that she gets more recognition out of Spain beacuse she has everything it takes to make it big.Just give it a try listening to the saples, you won't be sorry with this Superstar...Una vez m&agrave;s Marta Sanch&egrave;z me impresiona, le tomo 5 a&ntilde;os en lanzar un nuevo disco pero esta tan bueno este disco que no importa haber esperado tanto."MISS SANCHEZ" es un disco cargado de energ&igrave;a y a diferencia de su antecesor "SOY YO" esta mas dirigido a un publico mas joven, pero igualmente tiene las baladas que a Marta le van muy bien (un gran ejemplo aqu&igrave; es "CONTRADICCIONES"). El disco empieza con "LEVANTATE", esta canci&ograve;n esta llena de ritmo, muy buena canci&ograve;n. Luego viene "SI ME CAMBIAN LOS RECURDOS" que es una canci&ograve;n que para m&igrave; es un cl&agrave;sico ya que se unen dos grandes (Marta naturalmente y Alaska). El primer sencillo fue "SUPERSTAR" una canci&ograve;n que se convirti&ograve; en un gran &egrave;xito en Espa&ntilde;a. Esta canci&ograve;n tiene como ritmo de fondo la canci&ograve;n "JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH" de Depeche Mode. "REINA DE LA RADIO" es una canci&ograve;n pop que suena muy bien. Esta vez Marta quiso dedicar dos canciones, "FRIDA Y SUS FLORES" para Frida Kahlo y "TIENES QUE VIVIR" para su hija Paula. Dos grandes canciones que ella compuso. Otro tema quese merece se mencione es "EMBRUJADA" donde aparece junto a la voz de Marta, la de Tino Casal.Finalmente solo puedo decir que el disco est&agrave; mas que bueno y espero que Marta encuentre nuevamente el &egrave;xito internacional que tuvo hace algunos a&ntilde;os porque es una gran cantante, tiene una gran voz y su m&ugrave;sica es impecable.

I always liked Madonna but I never really became a huge fan. I have some of her albums but really the one that really got me was "CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR". I bought it right after I heard "HUNG UP" but I almost hesitated because I really found "AMERICAN LIFE" simple horrible. Anyway, I bought this combo for the DVD of her latest tour and I simply found it flawless.The DVD perse isn't loaded with extra features but you don't care because the show is amazing. Madonna starts the show with a fusion of Donna Summer's "I FEEL LOVE" and "FUTURE LOVERS" appearing inside a huge crystal ball and continues the show with "GET TOGETHER" and goes on and on with a great selection of songs. Besides the poor speacial features on the DVD, some Madonna's classic songs are missing on the show such as "TAKE A BOW", "RAIN", "DON'T TELL ME" or "LIKE A PRAYER" she should've made a medley including her old hits.What really impresses me is the perfection and clean performance of Madonna, she looks hotter than ever on this phase of her life, the choreography on the show is very good as the stage. One of the highlights of the show is when she appears on the famous cross and of course her voice is very good now. It's an incredible show, I don't get tired of repeating the same definition for the show. I really enjoy tracks like "JUMP", "CONFESSIONS", "LIKE A VIRGIN", one of my personal favorites "DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE" and "SORRY"Another impressive thing about this combo, is the big impact on the charts. In the US it debuted on Billboard's Top 200 selling albums on #15 and had similar positions throughout the world.Give it a try this is something that any music lover that doesn't dislike Madonna should have.

Shakira and her producers don't know what to do to make money. That's the only thing I can think after checking this production.Her 2003 tour was good. I saw her in Lima and I found the concert interesting, she sang several songs and had a good production. But This is cd is simply garbage (excuse me Shakira fans but it's true) from the 17 songs that she sang on her concerts she only adds 10 and let's not forget that &quot;Ojos asi&quot;, &quot;Ciega, sordomuda&quot;, &quot;Si te vas&quot; and &quot;Tu&quot; sound the same way that they sound on her Unplugged cd.There's only one new song which is &quot;Back in black&quot; but I wonder where are her other hits like &quot;Estoy aqui&quot; or &quot;Donde estas corazon?&quot;.If you want to buy this cd just do it for the DVD because the cd is simply trash. And besides, the DVD doesn't contain the whole show.I used to be a Shakira fan when she released her cd &quot;Pies descalzos&quot; and found &quot;Donde estan los ladrones?&quot; interesting but after that I can just say that Shakira isn't the same artist.

J.Lo is one of the few people in the world who can be so good in to many things. She acts and she does it very good, when she sings and happends the same thing, she is a business woman and the business grows.Talking about her music I can say that all her albums are very good but this one is my favorite."On the 6" peaked at #8 in the Billboard 200 albums and has the #1 hit single which was Jennifer's first song "If you had my love". There's also one duet with MarcAnthony, the song was sang in spanish, the song also became a #1 hit in the Latin Charts of Billboard, the song is "No me ames".One of my favorite songs is "Let's get loud" and "Waiting for tonight" which were also hits around the world.Her following cd's J.Lo and This is me...then are very good but they don't match with this one.

Anna Oxa may not be known in the US or outside Europe, but she is a woman with strong voice and an incredible strengh when she delivers her songs.Her career started back in 1978 when she release her first album, she was well accepted and since the she has released several albums. From her successful career I can mention her 1986 #1 hit &quot;E tutto un attimo&quot; one of the most important songs in Italy of that year. In 1989 she released &quot;Tutti i brividi del mondo&quot; a multi-platinum album that was presented with a song of the name of the album. The song became #1, not only on a charting list but #1 of the year, Anna also won the San Remo Festval.After many years of #1 hits, gold, platinum and multi-platinum albums, Anna returned to the Italian charts after 4 years without a new album.This time she came back with an excellent production titled &quot;Senza Pieta&quot; an album of 11 songs, one including a feature of one of the most important latin stars, Chayanne, the song is &quot;Camminando, camminando&quot;, the song was released in Italy and because of its impact was also released in Spain.The second single &quot;Come dirsi ciao&quot; made Anna won once again the San Remo Festival, the single was followed by hits such as: &quot;Senza pieta&quot; and &quot;Verrai&quot;.After one year of its release &quot;Senza pieta&quot; was certified a big hit with #1 hits, incredible sold copies and good critics.Anna's style is unique, her music is basically soft pop but she also like to sing hard pop and even flamenco.Anna also released a new album in 2001, the album's tittle is &quot;L'eterno movimento&quot; also as good as this one.This album is the kind of that you can listen to several times and doesn't make you get tired of it, it's really good.Anna Oxa turns out to be one of the biggest stars in Italy.All the song are very good, I mean the rythms and the lyrics. I'm writting the songs in English in case if you don't speak italian.1-&quot;Le stagioni dei disinganni&quot; (The seasons of dissapointment).2-&quot;Verrai&quot; (You'll see).3-&quot;Senza pieta&quot; (Without mercy).4-&quot;Chissa&quot; (Maybe).5-&quot;Camminado, camminado&quot; (walking, walking/going on, going on).6-&quot;Luci e ombre&quot; (Lights and shadows).7-&quot;Come dirsi ciao&quot; (How to say goodbye).8-&quot;Che cosa dire di te&quot; (What to say about you).9-&quot;Il Dio della luna&quot; (Moon's God).10-&quot;Don't cry, sweet love&quot;.11-&quot;Camminando, camminado&quot;-duet with Chayanne (Anna in Italian and Chayanne in spanish).

I've seen several movies that were sequels but they were never better than the first movie. But for the first time with this movie I found the second better than the first one. If you have seen "THE DIARY OF BRIDGET JONES", you must see this one and if you haven't seen it. I would recommend you to start with that one so you can follow better the story.This time the picture starts with a very happy Bridget (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) who is deeply in love with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and that love is mutual. Everything goes perfect until Bridget and Mark have a fight that ends with the relationship because Bridget is jealous of Natasha (Mark's friend who is beautiful and rich) and because Mark is still very arrogant with her. After this appears once again Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is called to work with Bridget. The story goes to several places from this point and you can laugh very much and have a great time with this movie that also has a wonderful soundtrack featuring songs by Joss Stone, Mary J. Blige and Robbie Williams along others.With the speacial features you can find a hilarious interview from "serious journalist" Bridget Jones and actor Colin Firth and alternative beginnings, deleted scenes plus others.

I was thrilled when I knew that a Cher video collection was coming out but I have to be honest that I was a little bit dissapointed because this production could've been much better. Some video hits are missing like her 70's #1 hit &quot;DARK LADY&quot; which had a funny video but instead of that track you can find &quot;HALF-BREED&quot; which has a boring video that just shows Cher seating on a horse, then &quot;ALL OR NOTHING&quot; that was another hit doesn't appear and you can find &quot;MAIN MAN&quot; which wasn't a hit. I also think that it could have at least special features as lyrics, photo gallery or Cher commenting about the videos (that would've been great).But well not everything is bad here because you can enjoy several great videos such as &quot;IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME&quot;, &quot;I FOUND SOMEONE&quot;, &quot;WE ALL SLEEP ALONE&quot;, &quot;BELIEVE&quot;, &quot;SAVE UP ALL YOUR TEARS&quot; and &quot;LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE&quot; (featuring Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry and Eric clapton).

"Love hurts" was released in 1991 and had a big impact in Europe, specially in the U.K where debuted at #1 and had that position for 5 weeks, been certified Platinum x3. The first single was "Love and understanding", which was a Top 10 hit. Whether in the U.S it only reached Gold status and the singles didn't chart and happends to be unknow in that territorie.The production of "Love hurts" features big names as Diane Warren and Desmond Child.I'm a big fan of Cher and I think that her best albums are: "Cher" (1987), "Heart of stone" (1989) and "Love hurts". These 3 albums had the same direction (an example of that are the albums "Believe" and "Living proof").The lyrics in "Love hurts" are fantastic, they're strong and have lots of feelings.Geffen released 2 versions of this album. The American that has 11 tracks and the European with 12. The "extra" track is the 1991 European #1 hit "It's in his kiss" from the movie "Mermaids". The other songs have the same version on both editions. The other difference in this production is the artwork.I highly recommend this album if you're a Cher lover.

This review that I'm making here isn't about this DVD perse, is about the whole set of DVD's from El Chavo del 8 that have been released.I'm a big fan of this TV program and I was thrilled when I saw some years ago that some DVD's were edited. I got 3 or 4 and after watching them I was dissapointed because the episodes were cut and the image was poor.Now some years later I have all the DVD's and some are good but they're far from giving any quality. Another thing that bothers me, is that the backing music is different. It's more modern but far from being good. Nothing compared with the classic music that used to accompany every episode. To continue with the complains, another issue is that sometimes the episodes are repeated and they don't mention on the DVD case the episodes that features.Anyway, I think that they should release a set of every season including an enhanced image and sound which is really, really bad...oh, I also wish they release that episode when they went to Acapulco.With my review I'm only wanting to warn about the changes and the cut episodes but I must also say that if you're a Chavo fan, you're going to have fun eventually.

I've seen "Scary movie 1" and "Scary movie 2" and found them funny. A little bit stupid but funny (I bought both of them anyway). And I had high spectations for this one because I found the trailer very good. So when I got this one and started wacthing it, i was waiting for the good funny stuff to come but let me tell you that I just laughed during one scene and nothing more. Besides the movie only takes 74 minutes.You'll find several known people here like Pamela Anderson, Queen Latifah and Leslie Nielsen. Finally I can say that they tried very hard on this one because there were not several terror movies that came out lately and one proof of that is that you'll find here a parody of Eminem's "8 mile".

Cher has been singing for over 40 years and she did it very good and I think that she'll continue doing it. So in 2002 she decided to start what it was going to be her Farewell Tour.This show is similar as her 2000 Believe Tour but with more production and quality (with this I'm not saying that it was bad, it was very good actually but this is way much better).On this show you can see Cher performing all her hits plus others that were on the program but weren't added to the final cut of the concert that was recorded in the American Airlines Arena in Miami Beach. As every Cher show you'll see lots of costumes changing, specail effects, lots of dancers and all Cher's Extravaganza. She has been very clever doing it now that she can do it very good without showing weakness of any kind.Some of the songs here are her #1's &quot;Gypsies, tramps and thieves&quot;, &quot;Dark lady&quot;, &quot;Half-breed&quot; and &quot;Believe&quot; plus her other hits like &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;, &quot;Just like Jesse James&quot;, &quot;I found someone&quot; and &quot;Song for the lonely&quot;.She covered once again as the opening number U2's &quot;I still haven't found what I'm looking for&quot; (which honestly sounds better on her).And finally among the special features you'll find the new &quot;If I could turn back time&quot; video, 3 extra live songs, Cher's special version of West Side Story (not big deal) and behind the scenes.Very good Cher you did it again.

&quot;One day in your life&quot; is one of the best singles of this multi-million selling singer.The single reached #1 in 13 countries and in the U.S also reached #1 in the Billboard's Dance House Charts.This cd-single has the albums version plus some remixes that happend to be very good.The song is a great dance song, has a mix of pop and rock with great lyrics that talks about a relationship that has ended and one of them wants to comeback but it's too late. It has lines like: &quot;one day in your life, said love will remind you, how could you leave it all behind, one day in your life is gonna find you, with the tears you let me cry and baby I'm stronger than before I gotta lay it on the line&quot;.I'm sure that after you buy the single you'll buy the album.Anastacia is gonna go so far because she is very good.

I like very much Jennifer's music, I also have her 4 cd's and I think that this time J.Lo didn't impressed very much with work.&quot;This is me...then&quot; is inspired in the music of the late 70's and early 80's. The work is good but I found it a little bit boring. There are great songs like &quot;I'm glad&quot; (the video is amazing, actually incredible with the inspiration of Flashdance), &quot;All I have&quot; is also good but I really don't understand how it made it to #1 in the Hot 100. I like very much also &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;You belong to me&quot; and &quot;The one&quot;.The best song is definetely the Top 3 &quot;Jenny from the block&quot;.If you want to buy your first J.Lo cd, I wouldn't recommend you this one. Get another one.This cd reached #2 in the Billbord 200 and has been certified Platinum x2 but there's something that we need to understand about singers like J.Lo. They're great, they have good music and even though we haven't heard the cd we buy it because we like their previous works. But this is not the case as a new artist that sells millions because the cd is being a big hit and with it they're having success for the first time or after some years in the case of an old singer who has again a hit cd.

Rosana is one of the best-sellers singers in Spain, she has the power to decide to record an album every 3 years. Her selling status helps her very much with this kind of decision.She only has 3 albums and this one is the happiest one. Her letters are painful but beautiful. But "Rosana" has a little bit of everything, good lyrics, more flamenco rhythms mixed with that big talent that this woman has.Her music can be compared with Alejandro Sanz but she's much better.This album includes the hit singles: "Pa'ti no estoy" (I'm not here for you), "Gira" (Spin) and "Hoy" (Today).

I'm sure that everybody remembers the Top 10 hit single "Kiss the rain". This song was released in 1997 and became a big hit. "Growing pains" is Billie's first album and it doesn't have only one hit. There's also another hit called "A few words too many".Billie's voice is unique, is very strong (I have to admit that the first time that I heard "Kiss the rain" I thought it was from a male singer). I would compere her with Anastacia or Tina Turner but with her own style.Billie was born in England and after this production released her second and latest album "Vertigo" back in 2000 but the album went nowhere. I think that it was a good album but not as good as "Growing pains". I'm sure that if you hear one of her songs you'll buy this album and maybe you'll by her second too.

I think that Carlos is one of the best latin singers and he's tree albums are very good (this is the second one). If you don't know about he's music, it's pop with some tropical ifluences. If you've heard from him and want to buy one of he's cd's I'd recommed this tittle.The biggest hit of this album was the #3 "Escuchame" (listen to me) and has other hits like "Amiga sombra" (Shadow, my friend) and "Todo lo que soy" (all I am).The career of Carlos in music has been very good. He's first album from 1998 won a Billboard award, topped the Latin Charts and had 2 #1 hits ("Rezo" and "Y recurdo"). In 1999 he released "Todo lo que soy" that was once again a hit reached #4 in the Latin Charts and had the hits that I've named.He's latest album "Ponce" which was released in 2002 had only one official single "Mujer con pantalones" (Woman with pants).Carlos has a good voice and he's rhythms are very good. I really recommed this singer.

The first time that I heard about Mya was in 2001 because of the the #1, grammy winner international hit "Lady Marmelade" next to Christina Aguilera, Lil'kim and "P!nk". Ok let's be honest but out of the U.S Mya, Lil'Kim and Pink were not famous or even heard of. The song gave them the opportunity of their lives. So after the impact of Lady marmelade I bought Mya's "Fear of flying" cd because I found her good. The cd was good but nothing more than "good".So when "Moodring" came out I bought it and let me say that as soon as I heard the first song I found it very good, the whole cd is fantastic. It has great rythms, Mya's voice is also very good and the lyrics are strong and direct.Some other good songs are: "Fallen", "Hurry up", "You" and "Free falling".Mya took a long time to come back but it was worth it.

Even tough I'm a huge music and film lover. Marilyn Monroe never called my attention and the first time that I saw one of her movies was in 2002 when I saw &quot;How to marry a millionaire&quot; and found it very good and funny. So from that point I started to buy some of her movies. From all her movies my favorites are &quot;How to marry a millionaire&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen prefer blondes&quot;.This movie is fresh and funny. You may think that films from the 50's are boring and well sometimes they are but this movie has that classic effect that makes it remain &quot;young&quot;.The story is about two hot dancers (Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell) that are searching love and money and well Marilyn is desperated also for diamonds.So on one trip to France by ship they get involved in some problems with men and a diamond tiara.The movie contains several musical numbers including the classic song &quot;Diamonds are a girl's best friend&quot;.

I love Celine Dion, I bought a cd from her for the first time on 1997, when &quot;Because you loved me&quot; (from &quot;Falling into you&quot;)was very strong and I just felt in love with the cd. Then came the success of Titanic and I bought her next cd, &quot;Let's talk about love&quot; and was also great but I have to admit that I like more &quot;Falling into you&quot;.On december 1999 I saw this cd and I bought it, and I discovered great songs from years before that I when heard them when they were new, I didn't know that they were from Celine, I'm talking about songs like: &quot;The power of love&quot;, &quot;If you ask me to&quot; or &quot;Beauty and the beast&quot;.If you like Celine Dion I strongly recomment this cd. The songs are great, it also includes &quot;Because you loved me&quot; and my own favorite &quot;It's all coming back to me now&quot; (it's a pitty that they didn't add the long version) and of course one of Celine's best songs, &quot;To love you more&quot;.Celine also add to this production some new songs, such as the 1999 hit &quot;That's the way it is&quot; and &quot;If this walls could talk&quot; and the digitally new version of Frank Sinatra next to Celine &quot;All the way&quot;.Other songs that are in this cd is the Grammy nominated duet with R.Kelly &quot;I'm your angel&quot; and the 1993 smash &quot;Love can move mountains&quot;. Another song on this album is one that is very important in Celine's career, the song has beautiful lyrics and is a good song but I can't hear it anymore more because i heard it back in 1998 like one thousand times, the song is &quot;My heart will go on&quot; from Titanic.There is something that I must say, it's not good when a song is always on air, I mean radio stations or tv music stations.So I think that this is all I can say about Celine Dion because the rest is history.By the way if you like this cd, you must but Celine's 2002 cd &quot;A new day has come&quot; for me this is Celine's best with hits such as: &quot;I'm alive&quot;, my favorite song and the 2002 smashing #1 hit &quot;A new day has come&quot;.

This is Natalia's first album. It all happened with the success of the soap opera that she was acting in Argentina.The theme song was &quot;Cambio dolor&quot; (I trade love) and thanks to the soap opera she could open the doors that she needed to be known around the world.The album was a hit in Latin America, Spain and in countries like Russia, Greece and Japon.Natalia's voice is not strong or beautiful but she sings really good and her latin rhythms make this album warm and talented.It has hits like: &quot;Me muero de amor&quot; which is a lovely love song, &quot;Que si, que si&quot; a very good song to dance and other soft and dance songs like: &quot;Sabrosito y dulzon&quot;, &quot;Huracan&quot; and &quot;Vengo del mar&quot;.

Alejandro Fernandez is a very versatile singer who has a very good voice and performs very good aswell. He is a Grammy Award winner and has been singing for several years. He first started singing Rancheras as his father, the great Vincente Fernandez and sience 1997 he has been releasing some pop albums. Personally I just like his pop albums, because I don't like rancheras but I know that hi is very good in that field.Anyway, that was just a little introduction that I wanted to make in case you didn't know much about him.In 2007 "Viento a favor" was released and came with a big production including some big names in latin music business as songwriters including Sin Bandera's Leonel Garcia and Reyli Barba (a great mexican singer who writes for some big names and is also known for being in the past the lead singer of "Elefante"). This album also has a duet with Beyonce on "Corazon Gitano".All 12 songs are very good. They go from ballads to songs with more rhythm, the lyrics are very good and another good thing is that the songs are in a good order that lift you up and then relax you.Among the best ballads for me, there are "No se me hace facil", "Sin consideracion" and the first single "Te voy a perder" which was a very big hit in Latin America, Spain and the U.S. In the case of the songs with more rhythm, my favorites are "A manos llenas", "Eres" and "Sue&ntilde;o contigo". The three songs are really, really good. The lyrics and the sound are great.If you like Alejandro, I know that you'll like this album. If you want another cd from him, try "A corazon abierto" from 2004.

I thought that this movie was going to be hilarious because of the great cast it has, but it really didn't cause any good reaction in me. The movie is about a woman (Diane Keaton) who has a good life and when her husband (Ted Danson)gets fired, they find out that they are almost $300,000 in debt, so Diane Keaton finds a job as a janitor at the American Federal Reserve Bank and next to two other friends from hers who work there (Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes), they steal lots and lots of cash.I felt a little bit dissapointed because Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah always work in very good movies and I have never felt the sensation for the movie to finish because I was bored. Even though I felt that, I saw the whole movie and although the end is good, I didn't feel satisfied with the movie. Maybe lots of people can like this movie but I also think that lots of people are are going to think the way I do.From Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah who are very good actresses I would recommend some movies like:*Diane Keaton:-The first wives club-Something's gotta give-Town and Country*Queen Latifah:-Taxi-The last holiday-Bringing down the house

Thalia is one of the most important singers in the Latin market, she is famous for her soap operas and her lastest 3 music productions."Thalia" is "fine" from the 14 songs only 7 are new becuase several songs were in her previuos cd. The production is good but it's just the typical crossover and the following example that the producers took this time is very clear; "Jennifer Lopez", she sings with the same style, the first video "I want you" is a clear example of J.Lo's videos with JaRule. And this that I'm saying might not be very nice for Thalia's fans but it's true and another proof of the copy is that Thalia's husband Tommy Mottola was the promoter of Jennifer Lopez back in 1999.I also think that the album has some good songs such as "Closer to you" (my own favorite but just the English version because the Spanish one is not very good) and the Top 30 first single "I want you" next to Fat Joe.And finally I also think that Thalia's English is good and understandable because Shakira's English is simply a mess when she sings. Actually the best latest crossovers are Paulina Rubio's "Border girl", Marc Anthony's "Mended" and Thalia's "Thalia".

I like Natalie's music very much (actually I prefer her music as a solo singer) and this production is very good, all the songs have nice lyrics and this woman's voice is delightful.The first single &quot;Just can't last&quot; is her best song ever.10,000 maniacs is a good gruop but Natalie your music is better when you're on your own.

Paulina Rubio is one of those special artists that have a mix of talent and beauty. "Paulina" is an album that took two years to be made, after her last producton "Planeta Paulina", almost 4 years before this one, Paulina decided to change her record company because she wasn't able to do the kind of music that she wanted and becuase of that too her career started to descend, so she felt that she had to have a totally new comeback, that's when she changed her label company and called Estefeno (one of the most important latin producers who works with singers such as: Thalia and Chayanne)so when the album was ready, the first single was "LO HARE POR TI" a pop song with a great rhythm and lyrics, the song became an instant hit in America and Spain, and with this big impact Paulina's company decided to edit the album in Spain (the first in Paulina's carreer until that time), but this is just the bigging, "lo hare por ti" became also a #1 hit in Italy (then she was invited to the 2001 San Remo Festival)something rare for a country where you can only listen to music whether in Italian or English.The second single was the hip-hop ranchera "EL ULTIMO ADIOS" which was also a hit in both continents. The biggest hit of this album was the third single "Y YO SIGO AQUI" a great dance song.The other singles were "YO NO SOY ESA MUJER" another big hit in America, topping almost every chart list. "TAL VEZ, QUIZAS" was the last single, this song was written by Armando Manzanero, there's another great song, and I must say that was a pity that was never realesed as a single, the song is "CANCUN Y YO", this beautiful soft ballad was written by singer/songwritter Juan Gabriel. There was another single that was only realesed in Spain, the song was "VIVE EL VERANO" and became #1.Thanks to this album Paulina got 4 Grammy nominations, won 2 "Lo nuestro" awards in the "Best female album" category in 2000 and 2001, she also won Jennifer Lopez in an award ceremony, the award was a "Premio Amigo" for "Best female artist"."Paulina" was certified Platinum and Multi-Platinum x5 in the US, Multi-Platinum x2 in Spain, Platinum x2 in Italy and Multi-Platinum x5 in mexico and Gold or Platinum in: Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Argentina and Uruguay."Paulina" reached #1 in the US and Mexico, #2 in Spain and the Top 10 in other countries, this are just the peaks but "Paulina" was the best selling album in the US, mexico and Spain in 2001Thanks to this album Paulina was able to realese her latest album to date "Border Girl", her first one in English and she's also considerated the latest Latin Diva and other people say that she's the next Madonna.

Tina Turner is known as the singer that has sold more concert tickets in music history. On january 16th, 1988 she had her biggest night when she performed in front of 182,000 people at the Maracana Stadium.This show was part of her record breaking Break Every Rule World Tour that took from 1987 to 1988 and performed for 3,5 million people. This show includes some of her 80's hits plus her classic PROUD MARY. Tina's performance is very good even though she sweats a lot because of the hit but also looks thrilled all the time because of the energy of the crowd that cheers to songs like TYPICAL MALE, PRIVATE DANCER, I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN, WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE, BETTER BE GOOD TO ME and WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. The video starts with an intro from Tina walking in the beach and some footage from Rio, then the show starts with her classic cover ADDICTED TO LOVE. The one she had performed ever sience this tour. The things that I don't like about this video are that the show doesn't appear complete and that the image it's kinda dark but I also think that it's a must have for any dvd concert collector.If you like Tina, I'd recommend also her &quot;One last time&quot; dvd.

In november of 1999 there were two important things to celebrate in show business. First the 60th birthday of one of the most important figures in music and second her new album after almost 4 years.On this DVD you'll party with Tina's music were she sings the songs of her latest album at that time. The multi-platinum "Twenty four seven" and of course some of her greatest hits such as: the best, steamy windows, what's love got to do with it, let's stay together and river deep-mountain high.You'll also find an interview with Tina, special appearances by Paul McCartney, Bono and The Edge, Annie Lennox, Will Smith, Oprah Winfrey, Mark Knopfler, Sting, Mariah Carey, Al Green, Keith Richards, Bob Geldof, Phil Spector, George Miller, Gloria Reuben and Ricky Martin.The special guest of that celebration was Bryan Adams and Tina and him sang their duets (the 1985 Top 15 hit "it's only love" and the 1999's "without you"). Continuing with the guest stars, you'll also find special performances with Cher, Rod Steward, Mick Jagger and David Bowie.As part of Tina's band there was The Royal Philarmonic Orchestra and as special features in the DVD version you'll find the videos of the hits "when the heartache is over" and "whatever you need", Tina's biography and photo gallery.This DVD is a must have, Tina's performance is amazing, the guests are the best, the songs are very well chosen, here you'll also find rare Tina's footage from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's and finally you'll see Tina blowing her cake's candles.

I don't know if I can say that this is Alejandra's best album but it's definitely a very strong chapter in her career. I found a much more mature singer, more centered because even though I always liked Alejandra's music, I always thought that she sounds much better on songs that aren't so rock n' roll, and most of her biggest hits are the ballads. With this I'm not saying that when she rocks she doesn't do it right, she does but softer songs are simply a pleasure that she gives us."INDELEBLE" is not a sad album, it has has racket, electric guitars and all but it doesn't follow Alejandra's songs such as "DIABLO" or "LIPSTICK", it has more the style of "DE VERDAD" and songs of that type. It opens with "QUIERO ESTAR CONTIGO", one of the best songs of this production and like this track you can find "DEJALO" and "TIRANDO PIEDRAS". Within the touchy ones are "NECESITO AMARME" and the first single "VOLVERTE A AMAR" which gave Alejandra her first #1 hit in the U.S and topped almost every chart in Latin America. The album also became Platinum in Mexico on its release week and debuted in the U.S at #21 (Latin Albums Chart).Alejandra recorded this album in Italy and what surprised me is that Alejandra didn't choose Desmond Child to produce it as he did on "LIPSTICK" and her Grammy Award winner "SOY", Alejandra now took credit next to Mike Mars and Loris Ceroni.I wish this album gives Alejandra more commercial success in the U.S and Spain, it really has everything it takes to give Alejandra the opportunity to be on top beacuse she has lots of charisma, delivers her songs flawlessly and her voice is one of the best in the market.

I have to be honest that when I first heard this album I didn't like it very much but then I started to love it.&quot;Pau-Latina&quot; is a bit different from her previuos productions. It contains more fusions from hip hop to rancheras and it's actually more energetic. It's clear that Paulina wanted to explore more her latin roots and the proof of that are her songs with lots of ranchera influences but she also likes pop, hip hop and even flamenco from from all this mixtures she makes a strange but great kind of music.She didn't leave behind ballads. You can find in this production three good ballads (&quot;Mia&quot;, &quot;Volveras&quot; and &quot;Amor secreto&quot;).Pop is also present here. The pop songs are &quot;Te quise tanto&quot;, &quot;Alma en libertad&quot; and &quot;Adiosito corazon&quot;. The more fusionated songs are &quot;Baila que baila&quot;, &quot;Perros&quot;, &quot;Quiero cambiarme&quot; and &quot;My friend, mi amigo&quot; which is GREAT. The songs with more influence of ranchera style are &quot;Ojala&quot; and &quot;Dame otro tequila&quot;. Finally you have the pop/rock one &quot;Algo tienes&quot; that is available also in an instrumental version.The first single was an instant hit. It became #1 in the U.S in just three weeks which is something very difficult and it also topped charts all over America, Spain and countries like Italy.The album debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top 75 Latin Albums, leaving behind albums by Thalia and David Bisbal that were released the same week and &quot;Pau-Latina&quot; has been already been certified Platinum in the U.S.The album has been produced by Marco Antonio Solis, Emilio Estefan Jr., Paulina Rubio between other top producers.Paulina found her big success with her 2000's album &quot;Paulina&quot; which sold 4 million copies and gave her the opportunity to make the crossover with success and with all this she received 4 Grammy nominations and several Top 10 songs and finally her first #1 hit in the U.S this year with &quot;Te quise tanto&quot;.Finally I'd like to say that if you have her previous albums you may not like very much this one the first time that you hear it, but believe me you'll love it.

This girl seems to have everything. She is very good looking, has a very mellow but strong voice and an infinite talent. Her music is very unique and has a real personality which is something not very easy to find nowadays because singers only look for commercial success. Lena's music is a very elegant pop including piano on every track. This really makes the album unique, old fashioned but at the same time very fresh. She's the one who plays the piano and makes the music for the songs that she composes with very good lyrics.The first single of this albums was "TU CORAZON" next to Alejandro Sanz. This song was a hit in Latin America but it didn't make an impression in the US. I don't know why. That song is the most beated up on the album, the rest are ballads but some of the ballads have background racket what makes them more enjoyable. The second single of this album was track #8 "PUEDO JURARLO" a song with incredible lyrics and sound, that song is amazing such as "QUE SERIA DE MI", in overall the song album is very good, every song is fantastic because Lena has a flawless performance.Beyond commercial success which was something that Lena or this album had, the academy really made a good job by nominating Lena as "Best new artist" and giving this album also a Grammy nomination. I hope that Lena wins at least one and continues singing beacuse it's a real pleasure listening to her music.

I bought this watch back in 2003 and I was very happy with it. Now a couple of years later I use it every now and then but it doesn't trill me as it did time ago. The reason is because watches now are different, they are more fashionable. Well talking about watches may be complicated because in the past you were completed with just one watch but not any more. There are watches for suits, for casual clothes, steel, yellow or white gold, strap, no strap diamonds, no diamonds (even on men). So going back to what I was saying before, today rubber is hot in watches as several materials (ceremic, titannium) and something very important today. Watches are big now. The Rolex Daytona is 40mm and now the minimum suggested size is 44mm (I can't understand why Rolex doesn't refreshes its collection). Any typical male watch from the past looks for women's now. Another negative thing about this model is that it doesn't have date (big mistake). Well anyway, this watch is also a classic, is pretty and basiclly looks good with everything and the price is not very high (I know that's not a small amount but prices nowadays are really high). My advice is to look for several options and never by a watch by photo, go to a jewerly store, see it and try it on, and is also nice when you have a watch that not necessarily everybody has. Rolex and Rolex Daytona is a watch that lots and lots and lots and lots of people own, try something different it's also a another advice that I can give.

I agree with people complaining about this season because it was released in two parts but I also think that has nothing to do with the quality of the series.The sixth season was the longest and the best, actually I've seen all the seasons and found them better one after the other. This first part with 12 episodes contains the comedy of season 3 and the maturity of season 4. It also shows how the caracters are finding their ways in life. Carrie starts dating a writer. The relationship seems serious in the beginning but then it has a twist and then on the last episode Carrie meets someone very special.Charlotte falls in love with her divorce lawyer and becomes jewish while she tries to get married with him. Miranda's nights become strange when she spends every night watching a series where a white woman falls in love with a black guy who lives in her same building and that actually becomes a reality in her own life, but again there's a big twist on the last episode of this part of the season. Finally Samantha gets where she or any viewer would have ever thought. She dates and has sex with just one guy during the 12 episodes. This guy was a waiter in one restaurant and Samantha wanted to have on-night-stand with him which she has but then she meets with him again in a party and then she finds him special and she helps him very much when she makes him become a star. (That doesn't mean that there are not funny scenes, yes there are several funny scenes).If you have seen the seasons before this one, this one is a must have to continue with the story. And if you have seen some episodes, I'd strongly recommend you to watch Sex and the city from the very first episode on season one.

There's no doubt that 2001 was their year. They won a Grammy award and performend this excellent show with Mtv.On this DVD you can see the whole show without cuts. The production it's purely first class, from the song selection and the duet with Ely Guerra on &quot;El duelo&quot;. You can find one song in English and another in French besides their hits in Spanish. The sound is very good, the chours are also great. Everything is very good. As a matter of fact this is one of the best Mtv Unpluggeds ever in the Latin category.Besides the show you can find lyrics in english and other special features.

Fisrt of all, I would like to say that I would have loved to rate this DVD with 5 stars because it's very good, but there are several songs missing.Alejandro is at the top of his carreer, he delivers the songs even better and singing in Spain opened a big door for him (I have to mention that not just from this year his albums are on that market). The production for this concert was very goood, bringing guests including Amaia (Lead singer of Spain's "LA OREJA DE VAN GOGH"), Mal&uacute; (a young singer who was on Operaci&oacute;n Triunfo, what happends to be the Spanish version of American Idol. Actually I don't know if this girl won or not. I would have invited someone else because this girl doesn't have a lot to give, she just sings ok but Spain has great singers such as Marta Sanchez, just to mention one) and finally Diego "El Cigala", a great flamenco singer.Alejandro looks excited throughout the concert and gives his best. The concert is very varied from his classic Rancheras including the famous tracks "EL REY", "MEXICO LINDO Y QUERIDO" and his own hits including "TANTITA PENA" and "COMO QUIEN PIERDE UNA ESTRELLA" next to Diego "El Cigala" where they mix the classic Ranchera with Flamenco. Great performance. He also sings a potpourri from Mexico's great Juan Gabriel. Finally you can find his latest songs and hits including "CANTA CORAZON", "ME DEDIQUE A PERDERTE" next to Amaia and the heartfelt "QUE VOY A HACER CON MI AMOR". Other highlights from the show are the never-heard-before "TODO" and "CONTIGO APRENDI".With the special features which aren't much you can find some footage of the rehersals and comments from the guests.

I think that Melissa is one of the best female rock and roller's, her music it's very good and her lyrics are even better.When I first bought this DVD, I never realised that she was going to be on stage totally alone, I thought that the tittle was "Live and alone" because she had broked with her partner, but just that.She sings in this concert al her hits, such as: "Bring me some water", "I'm the only one", "Come to my window" and "I want to come over" (the only hit missing is the Grammy winner "Ain't it heavy"). You can feel the quality of her voice but the concert was so, so, incredibly boring, I mean, can you imagine being seated for 2 hours listening to a person just singing in sort of "Capella style"?. If I would had been in that concert, I thought I would had stand up and leave the building.As I say, she's great and her latest album "Skin" is wonderful, actually it's my favorite, but don't waste your money buying this extra boring DVD. I hope the her record company releases someday a real concert of her on dvd.

I don't know why I always relate this successful group with fun. It's just that their music, lyrics and image are so natural and relaxed. But I also have to say that besides being successful (something that can be common in singers or groups who simply have a smash but it's just fluke). Their are talented. They can mix several types of music and although the three guys sing separately on almost every track you can hardly notice the difference. On the other hand, Fergie's voice is very, very good.For me "MONKEY BUSINESS" is way much better than their previous album "ELEPHUNK" and the commercial success also indicates that. The album is selling very well and the singles "DON'T PHUNK WITH MY HEART", "DON'T LIE" and "MY HUMPS" were Top 15 hits on Billboard's Hot 100 (they peaked at #4, #14 and #3 in that order).Something not very usual with this album is that the second and third singles were released almost simultaneously.The booklet doesn't include lyrics but it does include lots of info about the group. Including how they like to travel and what they eat while on tour between other things.As special guests for this production, you can find Justin Timberlake, Dante Santiago, Jack Johnson (he co-wrote "GONE GOING" and also sings in the song but I don't know why you don't get this info on the booklet or the cd case), Bobby Brown and Sting.Check out the songs "PUMP IT", "DON'T PHUNK WITH MY HEART", "MY STYLE", "DON'T LIE", "MY HUMPS", "GONE GOING" and "THEY DON'T WANT MUSIC".Great album really.

Let me just say that this is one or maybe the worst that I ever bought, I like Shakira but I think that sometimes she needs sever help from good producers. I think that her albums "pies descalzos" and "donde estan los ladrones?" were good but this is just the copy of "donde estan los ladrones?" it's a waste of money because 10 of the 11 songs were from that album leaving behind several hits from "piees descalzos".Really don't buy this album because it's terrible you can buy better the studio album andc by the way let me just say that the DVD is also not good at all.What happen to you Shakira I think that you had to pay the academy to win a Grammy for this "cd".I rate this cd with 1 star because there's not a -5 rate for this.

Marta Sanchez is one of the most precious jewels in spanish music.She has a unique style and every time that she releases a new album she gets a better kind of voice.She found success in the late 80's with the band Ole-Ole with them she recorded several hits but her career peeked in the early 90's with her multi-platinum album &quot;Mujer&quot; the first single &quot;desesperada&quot; became a huge hit in every country where was played, she also made an english version of the album.Her second album &quot;Mi Mundo&quot; also became multi-platinum the second single &quot;arena y sol&quot; sold over 500,000 maxi singles only in Mexico by 1997 she realesed her third solo album &quot;Azabache&quot;, &quot;azabache&quot; topped the spanish charts like her previous albums and also did its first single &quot;moja mi corazon&quot; wich had Slash as a special guest in the guitar.Marta once again topped the charts with &quot;vivo por ella&quot; a duet with the italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and few months later in 1998 she realesed &quot;Desconocida&quot; in this album Marta changed a bit her directon delivering her voice through slows balads like &quot;los mejores a&ntilde;os de nuestra vida/i megliori anni della nostra vita&quot; but she didn't stop doing dance songs one of them was &quot;mas de ti&quot; this single became as usual in Marta a big hit in Spain and countries like Argentina or Mexico, after this work Marta took a long vacation (in 2001 she realesed a greatest hits album) until this july when Marta released her latest album to date.2002 is beeing a wonderful year for Marta she got married, she released her latest album wich had good comentaries including latin latest diva Paulina Rubio, the album became gold in Spain on its release week and the first single &quot;sigo intentando&quot; written by Marta topped the charts in Spain.About the album i can say that it's a piece of work, it's a gem all the songs are wonderful with this album you can dance, cry or fall in love or even feel get rid of a bad relationship if you buy it you'll understand me.

It's incredible that almost 20 years after its release, this album is still strong that RCA released this new and enhanced edition.I remember being 7 years old or so when I bought the original soundtrack and it was a major hit. I knew all the lyrics and used to play it endless times (it was a cassette at that time). The success of the movie and soundtrack were incredible and the most amazing thing is that the movie took place in the early 60's and you can find songs from the 80's with that particular style that the songs from the 80's have and you won't even mind about that difference of sound and style. Among the new songs for this soundtrack. You can find the #1 hit "I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE" and "HUNGRY EYES" a song performed by Eric Carmen. The song was the second greatest hit of this production, peaking at #4 on Billboard's Hot 100. Actor Patrick Swayze recorded "SHE'S LIKE THE WIND" a song that also became a hit. The album was a big hit with sales exceding the 20 million copies, a Grammy award and an Oscar.This new production is very special because it contains 26 songs (the original only has 12) including the Kellerman's anthem and with this you have all the songs that appear in the movie sequenced in the order that they appear in the film. The only song missing is a song (I don't know the its name) that Lisa, Baby's sister sings during a rehearsal. The other difference that this edition has is that the theme song "I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE", is added in its original edition, not the radio edit version as the original soundtrack.This cd is worth it even tough you have the original.

I think that Christina Aguilera has one of the best voices in music business today. Besides from that she also performs very good on stage. This DVD shows how was Christina's first world tour. The show is very good, has several dancers, the production was flawless and the stage is also good. What I didn't like very much was that Christina cuts some of the songs as the #1 hit "LADY MARMALADE". For "COME ON OVER" Christina made a very good change taking the song to an unplugged interlude with a little gospel style, "FIGHTER" was one of the best songs in he show. For "WHAT A GIRL WANTS" you'll see a great introduction. Christina also added a cover, the classic "AT LAST", and finally the show ends with "BEAUTIFUL". You can find here the best songs of her latest album but the only song missing here was "I TURN TO YOU" from her first album from were she sings only the hits.Besides the show you get as bonus features an interview and some extra footage. What I think that would've been great was to add the music videos of her latest album "STRIPPED".

I think that we had had enough of Shakira this latest years and we need a brake from her. Maybe in the U.S she's a brand new singer but sience 1996 we (latin people) haven't stop hearing her and we're tired. I think that she should take a vacation for at least a year and then comeback with a new album. But in the meantime she shoudn't release any other single.

For some people music charts, don't mean anything, but for some others is something interesting. This Billboard book includes the songs from every singer or group that reached the Top 40 in the U.S. This starts in 1955 and comes all the way to 2003 (I believe that they should be thinking about releasing an updated version). You can find the songs by singer and on each singer there is info and every song indicates the number of weeks the single spent at #1 or #2, plus the date and how many weeks was on the Top 40. Another interesting thing is, that indicates RIAA certification if a song had that recognition.Looking for information on this book is very easy bacause, as I said before you can search by singer but also on the last part of the book, there is a section for the songs that were #1 during each year. Also indicates between other things, the singers with more #1 singles and with more weeks on the Top 40.If you like this kind of music information, this book is very good. Another thing that I must comment is, that if there was a song that you heard a lot in a year and you don't remember the tittle or who sang it, checking here would be a good way to get that tittle.

Carlos Ponce has only 3 albums but and each one of them have a good production. He works with one of the best producers in latin music industry (E. Estefan Jr.).What is curious is that this album went actually nowhere, eventhough had a strong background with the series that Carlos was acting in and the theme was very good.The first official single was a big hit in Latin America (&quot;Mujer con pantalones&quot;/&quot;Woman with pants&quot;). In the U.s reached #15. The song has good lyrics and the rhythm makes you feel like dancing.I know very much about music and I collect cd's and I think that Carlos is one of the best male latin singers, he has a very good voice also. He's first 2 albums were very successful reaching Gold and Platinum status, he also had several #1 hits.

It's incredible that we had to wait almost 20 years to buy this soundtrack on CD and it's also amazing that &quot;One of the living&quot; never appeared in any Tina Turner production.The 2 songs that Tina recorded for this soundtrack were big, big hits in 1985 causing a war in the charts and award ceremonies between them.&quot;We don't need another hero&quot; was written and produced by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle who also wrote Tina's #1 hit &quot;What's love got to do with it&quot;. The single reached #2 on Billboard's Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1986.&quot;One of the living&quot; was produced by Mike Knight and Humberto Gatica. Knight was the producer of Tina's Grammy award winner, Top 5 hit &quot;Better be good to me&quot;. The single won a Grammy award in 1986 for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and peaked at #15 on Billboard's Hot 100.The three other songs were performed by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and were conduced and composed by Maurice Jarre.

It's strange that just after 4 years and only one new studio album. Marta is releasing a new greatest hits album. Actually it would be difficult to choose between one and the other. The first one; "LOS MEJORES A&Ntilde;OS DE NUESTRA VIDA" has more songs and the selection is better but you won't find any new songs. On this one you notice the effort just with the cover (one of the best cd covers that I've ever seen) and the fact that she has recorded 3 new songs including "PROFUNDO VALOR" a song that she wrote for her twin sister who died from cancer. The song has very emotional lyrics and had reached #1 on the spanish charting lists. Finally I have to mention that two of her biggest hits had been re-recorded for this production ("DESESPERADA" and "SOLDADOS DEL AMOR"). "DESESPERADA 2004" sounds much better than the original.All this is if you know about Marta's career. If you don't know much. I can tell that she has an amazing voice and that her music goes from pop to dance and ballads to blues. She also happends to be the Spanish singer who works with some of the best producers in the business, including Paul Barry who usually works with Cher and other top singers and she even affords to record her productions in the U.S even though she lives in Spain and her music audience is almost all from there.The DVD includes most of her videos and has an exclusive interview plus behind the scenes from her 1993 video "DESESPERADA". The DVD is good but it could have better like including all her videos or her latest video from "PROFUNDO VALOR"

Tina Turner is one of the best singers in music history and has been working for over 40 years. This year she released a very successful double cd greatest hits album named "ALL THE BEST" that contains 90% of her hits plus 3 brand new recordings. The album debuted at #2 in the U.S and went Platinum in a month. Very good deal but now this new greatest hits is released some months after and it's simply shameful. It contains some of her biggest hits but come on, where's the Top 15 hit and Grammy Award winner "ONE OF THE LIVING" which isn't on any Tina recopilatory?. The only song from here that doesn't appear on "ALL THE BEST" is "LOOK ME IN THE HEART" which is good but only one song, that can be also find in ther 1991 recopilatory "SIMPLY THE BEST". I should have added the 1996 smash "WHATEVER YOU WANT" or "DON'T TURN AROUND" from the B side of the "TYPICAL MALE" single, just to mention a song.The booklet from "ALL THE BEST" was weak and this one contains the same pictures and info. No further info from Tina's carreer, no charts history, no nothing.That's my comment for any Tina fan or just the people who don't consider themselves as fans but follow her music. If you want to have something from Tina or just a recopilatory, I'd recommend the original "ALL THE BEST" with the two cd's that besides having much more songs, the price is very good.

When Reyli was the lead voice of Elefante, he never really called my attention but a gave a shot to this cd and from the biginning I started to like it. The opening track "CALMA" is very relaxing and it's followed by "HASTA QUE AMANESCA" which cheers up very much your mood with its energetic rhythms. The album goes from ballads such as "DESDE QUE LLEGASTE" (which you can also find in a semi reggae hidden version at the end of the album), "AYUDAME", "SE QUIEN SOY", "TU" and the nominated for a Grammy for song of the year. "AMOR DEL BUENO", which was a very big hit around Latin America. "AL FIN ME ARME DE VALOR" has more beat and the lyrics are fantastic. On "NOS QUISIMOS" Reyli shares the studio with Franco de Vita and the song sounds very, very good and finally, "LA DESCARADA" has a catchy sound, this is one of my favorites not just because of the sound, but the lyrics. What I find very interesting about Reyli, is that he has the ability to change very much his voice. Is like every song was sang by one different singer. That's not something that lots of singers do and I think that it gives Reyli a plus.I really enjoy very much this album because it has something for every mood and you don't get tired of it because Reyli's very versatile.

Funk, funk and funkier is what I can say about this very talented singer.She became famous back in 2000 with her smash hit "I try" and with her multi-platinum and first album "On how life is".This time is "The ID", better songs such as her duet with Erykah Badu "sweet baby" another hit song from this production is "Sexual revolution". One of my favorite songs is "Relating to a phycopath" which is inspired in music of the 70's.If you have her first album I'm sure you're gonna love this one.

This album is very good, I think that every music lover or collector should have it. Donna Summer is a piece of music history and VH1 had this good idea to release her hits in a different way.&quot;Live and more&quot; has big hits from the 70's and 80's, historical songs like &quot;On the radio&quot;, &quot;She works hard for the money&quot;, &quot;Last dance&quot; and &quot;Hot stuff&quot;.The production is very good, her hit with Barbra S. this time was performed by one of the most famous singers from Australia, the great Tina Arena (I think that I don't need to say that that song was &quot;No more tears&quot;). Donna also recorded 3 new songs for this album which are &quot;My life&quot;, &quot;Love is the healer&quot; and the 1999 hit &quot;I will go with you&quot;.Other great songs in this album are &quot;MarcArthur park&quot;, &quot;This time I know it's for real&quot; and &quot;Dim all the lights&quot;.

I like movies about airplanes and because of that I have several of these movies and one of those is this one.The cover and the tittle of the movie make you think it's good but there's nothing good in it.The story is interesting but what makes the movie very bad, is the poor, poor production. The set that it's supposed to be a Boeing 747 with 400 people looks like a very small plane (you'll only see inside the airplane like 25 people during the whole movie). The special effects are terrible, you'll see the airplane fyling but no with a close image and you'll see it like for 2 seconds. The airplane that they use changes from name and colors all the time, then when something good is going to happen they just change the image and put the sound so they wouldn't make a scenery for that scene. Anyway if you like a good movie, just don't get this one, you'll get bored because as I said. The story is interesting but the special effects are so bad that you'll get bored.Finally I'd like to say that I don't understand how Kate Jackson (Charlie's angels) acepted to be in this low budget movie with all the success that she had in her career.

When I heard &quot;I need to know&quot;, I just couldn't believe that was sang by him, because before this album, Marc Anthony used to sing Salsa music and I didn't like his music because I dislike salsa very much. So I didn't buy the album because I thought that it was going to be; 1 good song and the rest, salsa.But then I heard &quot;You sang to to me&quot; and I decided to buy it because a found that song very, very good.This, his first English album was a hit in the U.S and Europe. Reaching Platinum status in the U.S and it also had 2 Top 20 singles (&quot;I need to know&quot; and &quot;You sang to me&quot;).Marc Anthony's voice is good and his rhythms are very good and as I said, I don't like salsa but he gives his music a twist of salsa, but actually in a soft way and that mix happends to be very good. His music can be pop or dance but he does it very good.I would've rated this album with 5 stars but I find difficult to believe that his music company didn't add the spanish version of &quot;You sang to me&quot;.

I like very much Alejandra's music and I was more than excited when I knew that she was releasing a live DVD. But when I saw the DVD I was disappointed because it wasn't very good.First of all. The stage was very big and looked like empty, the sound quality wasn't good, the camera direction it's poor, the crowd wasn't very excited and finally Alejandra's performance wasn't her best.With the special features you can find a short interview with Alejandra, the two videos of her song &quot;Diablo&quot; and the video of her smash hit &quot;De verdad&quot; plus behind the scenes and rehearsals before the show.The sound can be in Dolby Stereo or 5.1 Digital Dolby (what I meant before about the sound was that it wasn't good during the show).On the other hand I can say that the song selection is very good, you can find almost all the songs of her 2001 Grammy award winning album &quot;Soy&quot; and her other hits such as &quot;Eternamente bella&quot;, &quot;Reina de corazones&quot;, &quot;Toda la mitad&quot;, &quot;Mala hierba&quot;, &quot;Angeles caidos&quot;, &quot;Mirala, miralo&quot; and &quot;Cuidado con el corazon&quot;.

&quot;Fallen&quot; is the second single of her latest cd &quot;Moodring&quot;. In this single you'll find the album's version plus 3 remixes and the song's video.The video is very good, it has a remix and Mya appears gorgeous.If you like Mya buy this single it's very good and the price is also very good.I'll also recommend the import single of her first single &quot;My love is like...wo&quot; which reached #13 in the Billboard's Hot 100 and it also includes the video. When I say to buy the import version it's because it has the video. The american version doesn't include the video.

The first season was good but this one is much better. The story now is that Paris and Nicole have to drive from Miami to Beverly Hills (they travel in a trailer). Once again without cash, credit cards or cell phones.This season has 10 episodes, all them very funny but my favorites are the ones where they go to work to a hotel as housekeepings. It's very funny because instead of working they call room service like they were hotels guests and when they're eating they call a housekeeper to make the room they had to clean. And my other favorite one is when they go to work to a sausage factory and they simply make a mess. All the episodes are very good, like one they go to work to a men prison, in another they work in a beauty salon.Paris and Nicole make a great couple, each one in her own style but finally they are outrageous.This DVD contains great special features including a lost episode from season one and never before seen footage.With this show you won't laugh a lot but you definitely won't get bored.Finally I want to say that with the languages and subtitles appears that there are Spanish subtitles but they don't work. I don't know why maybe just happends with my disc because I've tried with 3 machines. Notice that if you don't speak English.

It's increible that had been 8 years since this big star was murdered.There's another thing that I don't understand. How come her record company is not producing this masterpiece?.I want to share my story with Selena. I always heard about her but I never heard her music until 1995 when I heard that she was murdered by her manager. So in 1997 when I was flying from Lima to Miami the in-flight movie was "Selena" and I found the movie very good and I also must say that J.Lo and Selena were similar. While I was in Miami I bought the soundtrak (this album) and felt in love with it. Had been almost 6 years and I still hear it oftenly.This album has some of her Donna Summer's covers (I think that she was Selena's favorite singer) and several of her crossover songs such as "I could fall in love" and "Dreaming of you" from her Multi-Platinum first and only English album. And you can also find here her famous cumbias that made her win a Grammy award one yaer before her death.It's a pitty that she's not with us anymore but we still have her music.And the last thing I'll say is to buy this album if you like selena. I think it's her best one.

Tina is now 65 years old and is back to offer "ALL THE BEST", the ultimate greatest hits collection of her successful career of almost 50 years."OPEN ARMS" is the first single of three new songs that she added to her recopilatory. The song is very good and still shows Tina's strengh while she delivers the lyrics. This song did good in Europe where made it to the Top 10 in countries like England or Germany. In the US is also becoming a hit. Three weeks after its release is on #17 of the Adult Comtemporary Billboard's chart, and it's still climbing.This cd single includes "OPEN ARMS", the short version of Tina's 2003 release for Disney's "BROTHER BEAR" written by Phil Collins. "GREAT SPIRITS", "COSE DELLA LA VITA" next to Eros Ramazzotti and finally a short interview where Tina tells how she met Eros and how they did the song. I just wonder why she didn't make a video for "OPEN ARMS". Anyway, if you're fan of Tina's you should have this one but if you're looking for something from her I'd recommend "ALL THE BEST".

It's a pity that this album being so good didn't have success. In the U.S debuted at #64 in the Hot 200 but dropped very fast. And in Europe called some attetion but it wasn't a hit.This album has a different direction from all Cher albums. It's softer with strong letters but you won't find electric guitars as in many of her cd's or Cher screaming but it doesn't either go to boring.The first single was &quot;One by one&quot; that apperead on the soundtrack of Cher's HBO movie &quot;If walls could talk&quot;. The song climed some charts but it's not considered a hit.That's the commercial information that I can give you about the album.But from my point of view as a custumer I can say that's it's a very good album, Cher's performances are clean and excellent.The best songs are: &quot;One by one&quot;, &quot;Not enought love in the world&quot;, &quot;What about the moonlight&quot; and &quot;The same mistake&quot;.For this production Cher made 2 covers. The first is Tina Turner's 1986 hit &quot;Paradise is here&quot; which is the song with more rhythm in the album. Actually Cher changed the style of the song. Tina's version was soft, a pure ballad. And Marc Cohn's &quot;Walking in Memphis&quot; which sounds very good.You won't be sorry at all with this album.

Paulina Rubio is one of the biggest singers in the latin market. Her album "Paulina" was nominated for 4 Grammy awards and became multi-platinum in the U.S."Border girl" is her latest album and her first in English. The album debuted at #11 in the Hot 200 of Billboard and had good critics. To start this project she released her first English single that became an international hit in English and in Spanish with its version "Si tu te vas". The song is full of energy is a great dance song and Paulina's voice is sexy and that makes a very good mix.The video of the song was a million dollar budget and was also very good and hot.Good work Paulina you're one of the best.

There has been always a battle between Faith and Shania Twain because they're known as the queens of pop/country music.Shania may have more fame, Grammys and Platinum awards but Faith wins in voice and she also has Grammy awards and Platinum awards.By the way, I also like Shania very much."Breath" is Faith's most important album. This production counts with the hit single "Breath" which besides it stayed several weeks at #1 in the Billboard's Hot 100. Was the most important inportant of 2000. This album was certified Platinum x7, won Grammy awards, reached #1 in the Billboard 200 and includes the #7 hit "The way you love me" and a duet with Faith's husband, singer Tim McGraw.My favorite songs in this album are "Breath", "I got my baby", "The way you love me", "Love is a sweet thing" and the rock one, "What's in it for me".This is a great album, it counts also with Faith as a producer and the lyrics are very good.

I feel sorry with the appreciation that the US has for Tina Turner and her record company aswell.Since 1989 when Tina released "Foreign affair" seems that there's not a support for her in this country. The example is that "Foreign affair" turned out to be the best-seller album back in 1989 in Europe, the selling arrive close to the 7 million, whether in the US was only certified Gold (up to 500,000 copies).The singles "The best" and "Steamy windows" were successful but not in the magnitude that they had been in Europe or Asia or even Australia, ("The best" reached #15 and "Steamy windows" #39 in the US).In 1991 Tina released her last album with Capitol Records ("Simply the best" which sold several million copies) and signed with the EMI family. Her first work with them wasn't a new album, it was the soundtrack of her biogical movie "What's love got to do with it". The first single was "I don't wanna fight" which was a hit in the US peaking at #9 and "What's love?" was certified Platinum.But the time that all Tina's fans were waiting came in 1996 when she released her first new album after almost 7 years. The up-coming album was "Wildest dreams" which had a wonderful production, the songs in the album are great aswell are the lyrics. "W.D" has special features by Sting, Barry White and Antonio Banderas.The album came out in Europe in may of 96 and was a hit, the first single "Whatever you want" was going up to #1 all over Europe and then in october of the same year was the release of WD in the US, the first single was the 1984 cover "Missing you" which sounds wonderful from Tina but the song went nowhere it only reched #16 in the Hot Adult Contemporary and WD wasn't even certified Gold in the US, it sold around 450,000 but I think that the fault is actually from her record company because thay don't promote her much.The album it's full of energy with songs like: "Whatever you need", "Do what you do", "Missing you". "W.D" also has great love songs such as: "Something beautiful remains", "Confidential", "Dancing in my dreams" and the wonderful "On silent wings".It's a pitty that Tina lost the chance to return after 7 years with a big success in the US because the album also had the theme from the James Bond's "Goldeneye".Tina made a world tour during 1996 and 1997 were she sold-out all the shows and sang in front of 5 million people.The results of "Wildest dreams" were 3 Top 10 hits in Europe. Multi-Platinum status in the UK, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Iceland, Platinum in Greece, Holland, Germany, Norway and other and Gold in Australia, Japon, Korea and China.

Today is possible to say that Diego Torres is the most outstanding argentinian singer and this MTV Unplugged prooves it. Released in early 2004 this show contains Diego's biggest hits such as: "NO LO SO&Ntilde;E", "LA ULTIMA NOCHE", "SUE&Ntilde;OS" and "COLOR ESPERANZA". A song called by lots of people a hymn of peace and hope and also a very big hit in Latin America and Spain.The production of the show is flawless and in my opinion the best of all the latin unpluggeds so far. Diego added to his repertory new songs including the hits "CANTAR HASTA MORIR" and "USTED" next to another big argentinian artist, Vicentico. Julieta Venegas also performances next to Diego in "SUE&Ntilde;OS" and finally as speacial guests you can find La Chilinguita in "COLOR ESPERANZA" where his sings in Spanish and Portuguese. Another interesting thing about this unplugged is that some songs had been re-arranged in different styles including "NO LO SO&Ntilde;E" which sounds much better on the new version than the original, and "LA ULTIMA NOCHE".Within the speacial features you can find Diego's commentary, making of, subtitles in Spanish, English and Portuguese, behind the scenes, discography and weblink.In general this is a great DVD but there's one thing that I don't understand of this production which is why you can find on the cd the great song "QUE NO ME PIERDA" and it isn't here, anyway give it a shot it's great.

1993, was a very good year for Tina, she came back with a new production that wasn't actually a brand new album, it was the soundtrack of her autobiography sended to the big screen. The movie was "What's love got to do with it", the movie was a blockbuster and both main actors were nominated for the Oscar, they didn't win but Angela Bassett won the Golden Globe for Best atress, back in 1994.This cd was a big hit for Tina all over the world, actually Tina used to appear on the covers of the magazines, while the first single, "I don't wanna fight" made it to #9 in the Hot 100 and #1 in the Hot Adult Contemporary.For the soundtrack Tina re-recorded several of her early hits from the 60's and 70's. Tina's label decided to make two editions of the soundtrack. The European with 14 tracks and the American with 12.The songs that did not appear on the US edition were old hits which are: "shake a tail feather" and "Tina's wish".There's one thing that I don't understand about Tina in the US, how come she has big hits in Europe that never arrived to the US, such as the theme of the 1996's James Bond, Goldeneye, or Tina's latest European hit "Whatever you need", it's maybe because her record company doesn't promote her as they should in The US.That's a mistery actually that we'll never know.

The first time that i heard Anastacia was two years ago when she realesed her first album "not that kind" in Europe and it was the hotest album at that time all over Europe, where she sold 5 million copies and was awarded as best new artist all over that continent.And now I've bought this brand new album which is great, Anastacia has a powerful voice and rocks in every sentence of her dance and funky songs...she's great doing that but let me tell you that she delivers her heart with her love songs...I don't know how to describe her music...I'm a big fan of Tina Turner and I love her music and Anastacia has a similar style as Tina's if you don't know much of Tina Turner, you can also associate Anastacia with Taylor Dayne but of course this "freak of nature" has her very own style.This album has two versions, the european and the american version I have both, the songs are the same, the only difference is that the a.v has 13 songs insted of 12 and the plus song is a duet with Faith Evans and the other difference is that some songs have diferent versions (I like more the american version).The album starts with the sentence: "I'm a freak"...and then comes the song "freak of", then comes the first single that was a huge hit in Europe, "paid my dues" which is a funky great song, then comes a soft ballad called "overdue goodnight"...other good songs are: "one day in your life"(first single in the US and topped the Dance Billboard chart) "how come the world" (I love this ballad the lyrics are beautiful), "secrets", "why'd you lie to me" and "you'll never be along".This album has already sold over 3 million copies in Europe in just 5 months and there's something else, Anastacia is the oficial singer for football championship Korea-Japan 2002.Well let me just tell you that this woman rocks and if you like music buy this album, you won't be sorry.

Anastacia started her career in 2000 with her debut album "Not that kind", which was a huge hit in Europe with sells of 6 million copies. "Not that kind" had hit singles such as: "I'm otta love", "Cowboys and kisses", "Made for loving you" and "Not that kind". Even though the album was huge in Europe it bearly touched the American charts.In 2002 she released this,her second album "Freak of nature", an album full of energy. The first single was "Paid my dues" which became a #1 hit in Europe and Asia. Few months later "Freak of nature" was officially released in the U.S and its second single, "One day in your life" was the first American single that topped the Dance Billboard charts.Before "Freak of nature" appeared in the american market, Anastacia shared the stage with Celine Dion, Cher, Dixie Chicks and Shakira at Divas Las Vegas.The hit of this album had been very big. It topped the international charts for 3 weeks, it has sold 5 million copies in Europe and close to 500,000 copies in the U.S.About Anastacia's music I can mention that she has a mix between Tina Turner and Taylor Dayne but she has her funky own style.When she rocks, she rocks and when she sings love songs, she delivers her strong voice with all her heart. She really feels the lyrics that happend to be very good.The songs are fantastic, on this production you have the strong ones like: "Paid my dues", "Freak of nature" or "Why'd you lie to me". The soft ones like: "Overdue goodbye " or "How come the world won't stop". The ones where Anastacia gives her whole voice and feeling like: "You'll never be alone" and "Secrets". I can't forget the dance ones..."One day in your life" and "Don't stop".You'll also find a duet with Faith Evans in "I thought I told you that".The album is fantastic, has a bit of everything. Anastacia a great singer, she really knows who to make music and how to sing it and I'm sure that if you buy this album you're gonna love it to the point that you'll buy "Not that kind" too.These days Anastacia is on #1 with her latest dance hit "Love is a crime" from the Oscar winner movie "Chicago".

This is a very special DVD because it captures a part of Tina's career. Here you can find most of her biggest hits and greatest performances live.The track list is good but some songs such as TYPICAL MALE or WHATEVER YOU WANT are missing. Most of the videos are from the LIVE IN AMSTERDAM and ONE LAST TIME DVD's. Personally I would have added different locations or scenes, like for example on SHOW SOME RESPECT, they could have added the not-released on video the version from LIVE IN BARCELONA 1990 or added old videos from NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS, PROUD MARY or even ACID QUEEN. Just to have something new to see.For STEAMY WINDOWS you can find a mix of shots from 1990 to 2000 and you can really notice how a great performer and ageless Tina is that for 10 years she dances and performs with the same energy and strengh. One of the highlight videos is LET'S STAY TOGETHER, what a wonderful act from Tina, amazing. I'm also very glad the you can find here WHATEVER YOU NEED (ofor me this is one of Tina's best songs ever). With songs such as I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN or ADDICTED TO LOVE Tina rocks wildly. The BETTER BE GOOD TO ME election is good but the most powerful release for this track was the one from her 1985 PRIVATE DANCER LIVE video.Among the bonus features you can find THE BEST, BE TENDER WITH ME BABY, PARADISE IS HERE (never before seen live video), OPEN ARMS live on Parkinson, the video of COSE DELLA VITA next to Eros Ramazzotti and a 25 minute interview with Tina where she talks about her ALL THE BEST greatest hits album plus the three new songs for it.I really enjoy this video and even though you go from videos from 1985 to 2000 you feel them with the same power, it's like it was a full length video.My final comment is that I wish there's an up coming ALL THE BEST-THE VIDEO COLLECTION.

NOW always releases good cds and I've been buying them for several years. So when I saw this DVD here at Amazon I didn't hesitate and bought it but I found out that it wasn't that good but here you'll find some very good videos as:1- MYA: &quot;My love is like...wo&quot;This video was chosen by MTV as one of the 20 best videos of 2003. The song was also a big hit in the charts.2- SNOPP DOGG: &quot;Beautiful&quot;For this hit song, they made a fresh video in Rio.3- JESSICA SIMPSON: &quot;The sweetest sin&quot;For the first single of her 2003 album, they chose this song which is very good and for the video they chose as model Jessica's husband, Nick Lachey (&quot;America's young sweethearts&quot;)4- LISA MARIE PRESLEY: &quot;Lights out&quot;I have to be honest here, I thought that her music was going be horrible but her voice and style is very good as the video5- 3 DOORS DOWN: &quot;When I'm gone&quot;This is a video that was shoted with the American Marines that were ready for the war.6- COLDPLAY: &quot;Clocks&quot;The video of this song is very good also, in a very Coldplay way.Those are the best videos in my opinion. You'll also find in this DVD Evanescence's video &quot;Going under&quot;. I'would've added better &quot;Bring me to life&quot;.In general is a good DVD that you can easily like but there were other good videos as &quot;Me against the music&quot; (Britney Spears &amp; Madoona), &quot;Ooh!&quot; (Mary J. Blige), &quot;In da club&quot; (50 cent) or &quot;Where is the love&quot; (Black eyed peas).And finally another thing that I don't like of this DVD is that doesn't have special features.

It's a pitty that a concet such as this one didn't have a good video and cd production. The singers were great (Celine Dion, Anastacia, Cher, Dixie Chicks and Shakira).The first song it's the best one, the AC-DC cover "You shook me all night long" were you can see and hear two real divas (Celine and Anastacia). Cher also made a great work dressed as Elvis. In fact the live show was amazing but the edition on dvd and cd was terrible, the label left on a side several songs.I hope that one day they release the complete version because this one is shameful.

I have Jennfer's whole discography from &quot;on the 6&quot; to &quot;this is me...then&quot;, they're all good 8my personal favorites are: &quot;on the 6&quot; and &quot;this is me...then&quot;). Jennifer has a good voice and her production is very good, actually there's something that I didn't understand from this album, is that I don't know why they changed the lyrics and &quot;rhythm&quot; from &quot;I'm real&quot; and &quot;ain't it funny&quot; I think that the new version are good but also the other one swere also very good, in the case of &quot;I'm gonna be alright&quot; I must say that the new rhythm is very, very good.I'd like to rate this album with 5 stars because her hits are very well remixed but it's a petty that they changed the original version of &quot;I'm real&quot; which is one of my favorites songs.If you have the album &quot;J.LO&quot; I think that you all would agree with me.

Her previous album, "SOY" was a huge hit that even brought her a Grammy award. The album was produced by Randy Cantor and Desmond Child. Now "LIPSTICK" has also been produced by Desmond Child but even thought the album is good, doesn't reach the success or performance of "SOY". "LIPSTICK" has more rock influence but personally I think that the best songs from Alejandra are not the roughest ones. The proof of that are her biggest hits "HACER EL AMOR CON OTRO", "CUIDADO CON EL CORAZON", "ANGELES CAIDOS" and her smash "DE VERDAD". On the other hand I know that Alejandra's skills for rock are very good but there has to be a limit like her songs "MALA HIERBA" or "MIRALO, MIRALA" that aren't very hard. What I mean with this is that this album is great but songs like "HOY ME VOY A QUERER" and "SUPEREXITADA" are too valiant ("DIABLO" and "REINA DE CORAZONES" are hard but have a special touch). My personal opinion is that the best songs are "TU CORAZON", "TU ERES MI LUZ", "CREO EN MI", "TENGO DERECHO A ESTAR MAL" and her new smash "LIPSTICK" that can be also found here in English which I think is great. Alejandra's English is very, very good..You won't be sorry with this album but if you're looking for your first Alejandra Guzman album, buy "SOY" or "LAGUZMAN".Other highlights of this album are its three Latin Grammy nominations and that It sold 100,000 copies on its release week.

Melissa Etheridge may have great songs such as "Breakdown", "Come to my window", "Ain't it heavy" or "I'm the only one".But after her broken relationship with her female partner, she wrote the lyrics for this album. The lyrics are powerful and also a little bit depresing and hurtful but with lots of feeling.I'm gonna write a phrase of each song so you know what I'm talking about.1-LOVER PLEASE. (A shot in the dark Iwoke up the find, you had broke all the rules and you changed your mind, didn't I love you right?).2-THE PRISON. (I held you so close I thought my soul would brake, but you were a ghost, the holiest mistake).3-WALKING ON WATER. (What did you want?, how could I guess, you wanted more, I gave you less).4-DOWN TO ONE. (What went wrong?. Doesn't really matter when it's gone).5-GOODNIGHT. (All I want tonight is to touch you and kiss you, but I only kiss you goodnight).6-IT'S ONLY ME. (When the night is done and the morning arrives...it's only me).7-I WANT TO BE IN LOVE. (You stand on the doorstep in the rain, cause you couldn't wait to see me once again).8-PLEASE FORGIVE ME. (It's been so long since I've touched, so long since I wanted, the you made me laugh and my heart opened).9-THE DIFFERENT. ('cause you learn to hold on and time make it heal and time will make it gone).10-HEAL ME feat. Laura Dern and Meg Ryan (Heal me, lift me, take me to the waterside, drop me in, let me swim, let everyone know, I'll be coming home again).Melissa Etheridge is a 2 time Grammy award winner and has sold over 25 million copies.I feel that this is her best work ever even though it didn't have the success of her previous cd's.

Maybe her latest album "More than a woman" didn't reach the status of her Platinum x8 albums "Toni Braxton" and "Secrets" or her Double Platinum "The Heat" but that Gold album (I'm sure that it hasn't been a big album because it didn't have a good promotion but the album is very good)."Hit the freeway" is the first single, this song only reached #86 on the Hot 100 but the song rocks, it's very good.This cd single features the album version and some remixes of the song and it also includes the single's video that maybe it's not Toni's best but it's not bad at all.I heard that Toni doesn't work with Arista anymore and that she has a new record deal with Universal and that her up-coming album is programmed for this next september. I hope that she recives the publicity and treatment that she deserves because she's a big star."Hit the freeway" in my opinion is one of her best songs, it has the style of "You're making me high", it's very good.

Beyonce is very talented and she just had an amazing year with her multi-platinum album that brought her hits such as &quot;Crazy in love&quot; and &quot;Naughty girl&quot;. So now you'll have the chance to see that success on stage.This DVD contains a concert at Wembley stadium, where Beyonce sings almost all her solo songs plus a medley with the best songs of Destiny's Child. The show is very good (not amazing), Beyonce's voice sounds also good, but besides the show I think that the special features are also good with behind the scenes with Beyonce and Beyonce's performance at The Brit Awards 2004.What I think that what's missing in this production are her videos and the rest of the songs that come on &quot;Dangerously in love&quot;. Finally you'll get with this DVD a bonus cd that contains: &quot;Wishing on a star&quot;, &quot;What's it gonna be&quot;, &quot;My first time&quot;, &quot;Krazy in luv&quot; and a remix from &quot;Naughty girl&quot;.

The moment I bought this CD/DVD combo, I thought that I was going to rate it with 5 stars but altought the production of the show is one of the best or maybe the best that I've ever seen by a spanish singer singer. The image is not very good and some hits are missing such as "MOJA MI CORAZON", "DIME LA VERDAD", "AMEN", or "ARENA Y SOL".Then as special features of the DVD you can only find the video of her latest spanish #1 hit "PROFUNDO VALOR" which its song is very good but the video is really simple, and finally you get to see some photos of her 2005 tour which are very good.On the other hand Marta's performance on stage is flawless, her voice sounds amazing and the whole show is very good. Including dancers, lots of costume changes and good chorous. Another thing very good about the show is that takes place in the street (I believe in front of the main building of La Coru?a where Marta was born).The repertory is good but as I wrote before songs are missing but you can find hits as "DESCONOCIDA", "SIGO INTENTANDO", "DESESPERADA (2005 version)", "QUIERO MAS DE TI" and some of her old songs from her Ole, Ole days like "SOLDADOS DEL AMOR" and "CON SOLO UNA MIRADA".Both DVD and CD include the same songs and to finish I can only say that it could have been better this production but it's still worth the money to buy it.En el momento que compr? este combo de CD/DVD, pens? que lo iba a calificar con 5 estrellas pero por m?s que la producci?n del show es uno o tal vez el que mejor que haya visto en un artista espa?ol . La imagen no es muy buena y faltan algunos ?xitos tal como "MOJA MI CORAZON", "DIME LA VERDAD", "AMEN" o "ARENA Y SOL".Como extras en el DVD s?lo se pueden encontrar el video del ?ltimo #1 de Marta en Espa?a "PROFUNDO VALOR" que es bastante simple y finalmente se puede encontrar una galeria de fotos del show que es bastante buena.Por otro lado la performance de Marta en el escenario es perfecta, su voz suena muy bien y todo el show es muy bueno. Incluye bailarines, varios cambios de ropa y un buen coro. Otra cosa buena del show es que fue grabado en la calle (creo que es delante de la municipalidad de La Coru?a, donde Marta naci?).El repertorio es bueno pero como dije antes faltan varias canciones pero igual se encuentran ?xitos como "SIGO INTENTANDO", "DESCONOCIDA", "DESESPERADA (Versi?n del 2005", "QUIERO MAS DE TI" y canciones de sus d?as en Ole, Ole como "SOLDADOS DEL AMOR" y "CON SOLO UNA MIRADA".Tanto el DVD como el CD incluyen las mismas canciones. Para acabar solo puedo decir que esta producci?n ha poder haber sido mejor pero aun asi vale la pena.

Debelah may be not very known in the U.S but shehas a big fan club following her in Europe.Her music is basically with a touch of R&B; which turns out to be very good and her voice helps her very much.She has a big hit that was a Top 10 in Europe, I'm talking about her first single "Take the rain away" if I could compare her with another singer I would say that she has the style and voice of Mariah Carey (when I heard her for the first time I thought it was Mariah).This album is from 2000 and has the hit singles "Dance with me" and "Take the rain away".Good try.

This is a very good deal. Finally you'll get the chance to have the whole collection in just one pack, separated in two DVD's. Also the price is very good considering that you're purchasing 4 movies for less than 20 Dollars.Movie #1: AIRPORT (1970)This movie received 10 Oscar nominations in 1970, including Best Picture. The special effects are very good, but don't imagine special effects like Titanic, there are almost 20 years of difference.This story is about a Boeing 707 flight from Chicago to Rome and in the passenger list there is a man whois broke and gets an insureance for the trip so he gets on board with explosives to blow the plane so his family could claim the insurance.There are other stories in this movie like an old woman stowaway and the unexpected pregnancy of the captain's flight attendant mistress.Movie #2: AIRPORT 1975 (1974)This movie is not as good as the first one but it's good anyway.The story is about a flight of a Boeing 747 that in the middle of the flight crashes with a small private plane leaving no captain and first officer, so the senior flight attendant has to be in charge of the cockpit until an expert pilot gets on board in the middle of the air from another plane (something almost incredible to show back in 1975).Movie #3: AIRPORT '77 (1977)Another story about a Boeing 747 but this time is a private flight from an art collector who's carring several millions in paintings. So some workers in the plane plan to make sleep the VIP passengers with gaz so they can steal the artworks but everything goes wrong when then the automatic pilot crashes one wing with a petrol base in the Atlantic making the plane go under the ocean. So a rescue team have to save the pasengers who are 200 feet underwater before the airplanes cracks with the water pressure.Movie #4: THE CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 (1979)In my opinion this is the best one. The story is a bit crazy but very good making you be glued to the screen. It's about a nuclear weapons expert who plans to destroy the Concorde with missiles because his lover who happened to be a jurnalist has in her power documents that revealed his secret operations, so the pilot and captain have to skip the missiles and then prevent the damaged aircraft from breaking and crashing the French Alps.You'll find First Class actors in all the movies including: Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Jacqueline Bisset, Charlton Heston, Karen Black, Gloria Swanson, Linda Blair, Jack Lemmon, Lee Grant, Alain Delon, Roberto Wagner and George Kennedy who appears in all the movies.I really like this movies, they are very interesting and another thing that I like very much in this movies is that you can notice how we have changed our concept of travelling, now it's something normal and usual but you'll see that everybody in the movies are so excited because they're going to be inside of a plane and everyone is very elegant.

First of all I have to admit that I never thought that I was gonna buy a Britney DVD. I liked some of her songs and found her pretty and all that but nothing more, but when &quot;Me against the music&quot; came out, I simply found it excellent. So I bought the cd and then this DVD.This DVD contains the videos &quot;Me against the music&quot; (feat. Madonna) and &quot;Toxic&quot;, which to me is Britney's best song and video. The rhythm is perfect. Besides the videos you can find: &quot;Toxic, making the video&quot;, Mtv's special performances, making the album &quot;In the zone&quot; and an ABC special. And finally besides the DVD you can get a bonus CD containing few songs and remixes.You won't be sorry with this DVD even though you're not a Britney's fan. I can say this because it happened to me.

This spanish group has found success all over Latin America and the U.S. Actually in the U.S the hits started to flow one year after this album's release. The first single "EL SOL NO REGRESA" climbed the Hot Latin Tracks until it peaked at #37 (very modest hit in the U.S but very big in countries such as Peru, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, etc). The big smash in the U.S was with "ALGO MAS" which went all the way up to #3, giving the album Gold certification and making it peak at #7 on Billboard's Top Latin Albums. What a great ballad that song is. The third single "DARIA" it's making its own success on the charts and radios as well. This is just commercial comment and info from this album but beyond the success, this is an album mix with sytles where pop is the main root. The only singer of the three members of this group is the girl (something like Mecano bgut the style is not the same. Personally I like more this group). Give a shot to this album is very good, specially check the tracks "EL SOL NO REGRESA", "ESPERARE DESPIERTA", "DARIA", "FLORES DE ALQUILER" and the two bonus tracks, specially "SI YO FUERA MUJER".

Anna Oxa is one of the best singers of Italy. She started her career back in 1978 and sience then she had released successful albums and big hits in Italy. She is also a two time winner of San Remo Festival.After the success of her 1999 release &quot;Senza pieta&quot; she returned with this album that has 10 songs. One of the songs is in English (Take a little trip)(she has a perfect English) and another song is an old hit of her's (Un'emmozioni da poco) that Anna re-recorded for this cd.Anna has a beautiful strong voice. Her style is soft pop and her voice and style make a wonderful mix.If you know her and have another album of hers you must have this tittle and of corse her big hit album &quot;Senza pieta&quot;.I'm going to translate the songs in English in case if you don't speak italian.1-L'immenso e il sou contrario. (The immense and its contrary)2-Uomo dove sei. (Man where are you)3-Controvento. (Against the wind)4-Sister.5-L'eterno movimento. (The endless moment)6-Take a little trip.7-Notte d'immagini. (Night of images)8-Io saro con te. (I'll be with you)9-La vita dove va. (Where does life goes)10-Un'emozioni da poco. (An emotion little by little)P.S I wonder why Anna doesn't make the crossover and releases an album internationally because she has the voice, the style, the talent and the record company to do it. I hope that she do this kind of work someday.

Alright, I'm rating this cd-single with 4 stars because, on one hand, I find the track "DON'T LIE" very good (5 stars) but the remix version on this cd is really poor. The original song became an instant hit around the world. Peaking at #14 in the US and #1 in several territories.There's a never-released song called "SHAKE YOUR MONKEY", which is good but nothing really special. It really doesn't surprise me that didn't appear on the "MONKEY BUSINESS" cd. Finally you have the video for the original version of "DON'T LIE". The video is very good.So, if you like this group, I'd say to buy this cd. If you just like the song and you're looking for some good remixes, I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend the "MONKEY BUSINESS" cd instead even if it doesn't include any remixes but the songs are great.

Olga Ta&ntilde;on besides being the Queen of Merengue is known as "La mujer de fuego" (fire woman) because of her voice and strengh in her music and lyrics.In 2001 she released this production which was a big hit in the U.S, Latin America and Spain. The first single "Como olvidar" (how can I forget) was a #1 hit and was released in merengue and ballad. That single was follwed by "Mienteme" (Lie to me), another big hit.This album is basically a Merengue one, the only pop song is the ballad "Como olvidar". There are great songs to dance like "Tu te lo pierdes" (you miss it) that has 100% of rhythm, "Me gusta" (I like it) another great track, "I wanna have fun" which is in Spanish. There's one song that is softer but doesn't lose its Merengue style, the song is the one that gives little to the cd, "Yo por ti" (Me for you).This cd won the 2002 Grammy for best Latin album and debuted at #4 in the American charts.I would also recommend her 2002 cd "Sobrevivir" (Survive) which is amazing but doesn't have the rhythm that this one has. It has more ballads and also includes a duet with hit Latin singer Luis Fonsi and includes also the 2003 #1 hit "Asi es la vida" (That's the way life is) which is a Merengue song.
