Dolly surprised everyone with this album. Just recently Dolly had been let go as a result of Decca's closure, and she wasnt signed to MCA like many of the old Decca artists were, so Dolly decided to go independant. This is the best bluegrass cd ever. Dolly does a lot of old favorites and some new ones. From the album starter Traveling Prayer to the album's accapella closer, I Am Ready, Dolly covers a lot of ground here. Highlights include A Few Old Memories, Silver Dagger, Endless Stream of Tears, Cash on the Barrelhead, my favorite though is Traveling Prayer. You gotta get this one, be amazed like the rest of us. This is pure gold.

Middle-class girl, can act a bit, moves to the big city, climbs up the ladder and over a few men, sets her sights on nothing less than worldwide fame, does anything and everything to make that happen, and makes sure everyone in her life works toward the same goal. EVITA is, of course, the autobiography of Madonna. Or, at the very least, the story of Argentina's controversial populist hero Eva Peron is the role of Madonna's life. Say what you want about how well she acts it, but this lush pop-rock soundtrack is hard digital proof that she was born to sing it. Completely giving herself over to the role--the one thing her critics doubted she could everdo--Madonna turns in a vocal performance that may well surpass that on any of her own records.Madonna also, not surprisingly, dominates this soundtrack. She sings some parts, including the sad ballad &quot;Another Suitcase In Another Hall,&quot; that weren't written for the role of Eva Peron; and Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who won a slew of Tony Awards for the 1979 Broadway version of &quot;Evita,&quot; have given her a new ballad, &quot;You Must Love Me,&quot; that works equally well as an anthem for either Madonna or Peron. Actor Antonio Banderas, following up his small singing role in the movie &quot;Desperado,&quot; proves a more-than-capable Che Guevara.

UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is your standard romantic comedy, but well worth watching. Diane Lane stars, playing Frances, a newly divorced woman who goes on a gay tour of Italy at the suggestion of her gay friend Patti (Sandra Oh). She sees a house and before even thinking about anything, if it's even on sale, she decides she wants to buy it and put everything into it. She meets a bunch of different people and tries to readapt her life in a foreign country where she knows no one, except a handful of people she has just met. The movie is pretty predictable in what will happen, and how it ends, but it was still a fun movie to watch and get swept away in. The visuals were absolutely beautiful and watching it I felt as though I was taken along for the trip. Diane Lane was fabulous in this movie. Overall a pretty good popcorn movie.

Velvet Rope was one of the best albums of the 90s, it was personal and meant many different things. The tour was spectacular, where she sings many of the songs from Velvet Rope, as well as previous hits from janet., Rhythm Nation and Control. She really puts on a show and involves the crowd as much as possible. She puts her all into it. The dancing is remarkable, dancing only Janet can produce. Highlights include Velvet Rope, If, Again, the medleys, Any Time Any Place, Rhythm Nation, hell the whole video is awesome. You must get this, you wont be dissapointed.

Those of you who found yourselves mysteriously drawn to the dark sexuality of Garbage's debut might not get what you expect from their follow-up--at least at first. But a closer listen reveals that VERSION 2.0 is actually much closer to the true Garbage sound. The reason: Where GARBAGE was already more or less completed when Shirley Manson signed up, 2.0 allows her much more freedom to control the group's sound. The distorted guitar hooks, loops and industrialized production thatdefined Garbage's sound on their debut are still present, but tempered by Ms. Manson's strong pop sensibilities. If you listen closely, you can even catch hints of Blondie and the Pretenders. (They quote the Pretenders &quot;The Talk Of The Town&quot; in &quot;Special&quot;.) And while it isn't exactly the Spice Girls or Hanson, 2.0 is a much more upbeat, happy-sounding album. Instead of appealing to the brooding, listen-alone-in-your-room-with-the-lights-out crowd, 2.0 is aimed straight at the dance floor.

How sad is it that this CD was released. A supposed &quot;Hiatus&quot; yes. They just released this to cash in on their fans, and so no one will forget them. How can we when they are shoved in our faces at every possible moment, even when they are supposedly taking a break! So until they decide what they want from their careers, they will still manage to be a cash cow for their fans. Elsewhere, these remixes are far from anything good. Just another sad piece of plastic which isn't worth the time of day...Why don't they just take time off, I mean really take time off, and come back with something that is a good album? After SURVIVOR, I have no hopes for this disapointing group which was once good. This only adds to my disapointment.

R Kelly wows the fans once again with his newest effort titled TP-2.com (remember 1993's 12 Play? Think of this as part two). Once again he proves (although not intentionally) that he is the most talented male R&amp;B artist. He wrote, arranged, and produced all 19 tracks.The CD starts off with the sexy TP-2.com with a jumpin groove that will make you dance. Strip For You is a little of a twist, about a male singing to the woman, offering to strip for her for a change, a nice slinky R&amp;B soul song. R&amp;B Thug is one of the more R&amp;B flavored tracks. The Greatest Sex, I Dont Mean it follow. Just Like That is a sexy ballad, and Like A Real Freak is a fun song. Fiesta is a nice song as well.The tracks continue, after an interlude titled The Real R. Kelly, the ballads continue with One Me, and the well known first single I Wish. Some highlights include A Woman's Threat and I Mean (I Dont Mean It). There is also an I Wish Remix (To All The Homies That We Lost) which is nice. The album closes with the I Believe I Can Fly like The Storm is Over Now, which is a great album closer.I reccomend this album to anyone who appreciates really good music thats fun to listen to.

I remember buying this album the day it came out, April 21st 1998, 2 and a half long years since her second album It Matters to Me. Before buying the album, I had heard the mega hit This Kiss a lot. I was not disapointed with this album at all.Faith's voice has matured since her pregnancy, and this is apparant on these songs on this album. This Kiss became a #1 hit on country and pop radio stations, and that was only the icing on the cake. You Give me Love is a nice mid tempo song, which would of been a single. Let Me Let Go was another big hit on country and pop radio stations around the world, with Vince Gill to accompany vocals on the country version which is found on this cd. Love Ain't Like That is a nice simple song, the final single from this album, which did not fate well as in my opinion was not the best choice for a single.Faith decides to do some covers on this album. The first being the Becca And Billy hit Better Days, which is a very nice song. My Wild Frontier is a beautiful song, although somewhat sad. The Secret of Life became the fourth single of this album, a nice song that will make you sing. Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me is the Diane Warren written song that Faith's husband Tim McGraw sings background vocals on, the second single which fared very well on the charts, its a beautiful song. Me is a fun song as well.I Love You is a cover of the 1996 Celine Dion song, found on her Falling Into You CD, Faith does a nice job with this dreamy song. The Hard Way is a highlight on the album, which deserved to be a single (perhaps more than Love Aint Like That), its just a fun infectuous song. The album closes with the Sheryl Crow penned Somebody Stand By Me.It was a long wait but Faith never disapoints her fans, this is a nice collection of songs that will make you sing, dance and cry. I highly reccomend you give it a listen.

Lee Ann Womack has created another masterpiece, this is one of the best country albums I've heard in a while. Lets start with the title track, which became a mega hit, a career song for Lee Ann. I Hope You Dance is a song that empowers listeners, enstowing faith into them. Its no wonder it became a hit with its positive, empowering message.The album is a very eclectic mixture of songs, all which are excellent. There is some brutal honesty on this album in songs like The Healing Kind, I Hope You Dance, Stronger Than I Am, I Know Why The River Runs, etc. This is true country music, she hasnt abandoned her roots. She also has some fun on songs like Ashes By Now (the second single), Does My Ring Burn Your Finger, and others. This is a well crafted album and well worth the wait. So give it a try, it has the power to make you think about your life in a positive light.

At this stage of her career Mariah Carey does not need to prove herself, but her voice is so powerful that with each new recording she, once again, reminds you: &quot;Listen to what I can do.&quot; Vocal gymnastics and Christmas songs are not often thought of as a compatible combination, but on MERRY CHRISTMAS Mariah jumps, climbs, crawls, twirls and dashes her way through both traditional fare and original Christmas songs.She shifts through styles, offering fans from all musical camps a gift of their own. Her &quot;Silent Night&quot; shows off a studied vocalization where liquid phrasing is key. &quot;Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)&quot; shows off a dynamic voice that is hard to match. She has fun with the Phil Spector goodie &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),&quot; a song straight outof '60s girl-group heaven. There is even a &quot;Joy To The World&quot; medley mixing the old and the new--the traditional Christmas song and the Three Dog Night hit. And, as usual, her gospel-voiced background singers are out in full force.There are two ways to enjoy this album. One is to sit back and revel in Mariah Carey's vocal fireworks, and the other is to pour yourself a glass of egg-nog, get cozy by the tree and have yourself a MERRY CHRISTMAS.

The first time I heard He Wasnt Man Enough, I was blown away. I was glad to hear from Toni again. The song is one of the freshest songs out there today, with unbelievable beats and grooves. Plus the song is totally original, I have never heard a song like this before. I'm glad this song did so well, its not surprising at all. I hope Toni goes far, and I know she will.

Aaliyah's self-titled third album comes some five years after her sophomore effort ONE IN A MILLION. . The singer has obviously put her time out of the spotlight to good use. She's joined here by a few old friends, including Timbaland (a co-producer of her previous album who also shares some production credits here).For the most part this is a downtempo set, typified by the Missy Elliot-penned &quot;I Care 4 U,&quot; a slice of old-school R&amp;B that displays Aaliyah's sultry, fragile vocals to good advantage, and the Latin-inflected &quot;ReadBetween the Lines.&quot; There's more depth to Aaliyah than her stock diva cover photos might suggest, as evidenced by the ambitious opus &quot;I Refuse,&quot; which brings all the contradictions of a contemporary relationship into sharp relief, and the end-of-the affair &quot;Those Were the Days,&quot; the lyrical and musical content of which reveal the singer's darker, more interesting side. Well worth the wait, and the death of this talented singer was truly tragic, she was so young and had so much love and music to offer to the world. You will be remebered.

For years Shelby struggled, trying to make it in Nashville with her original blend of country. With her 2000 release I AM SHELBY LYNNE, she finds a way to blend country with jazz and soul to create an original sound. Her roots shine through on this album. Its good start to finish. The album brought critical acclaim and won Shelby a Grammy for Best &quot;New&quot; Artist (even though she's been around since the late 80's). Some highlights on the album include &quot;Why Can't You Be&quot;, &quot;Where Im From&quot;, &quot;Black Like Blue&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Back&quot;, but this whole cd is filled with excellent songs. Shelby has found her groove, and she's still making great music.

He's as big as big gets, and this album is one of the main reasons why: THE CHASE redefined the term &quot;crossover&quot; for the man in the hat and for the new breed of pop radio-friendly country crooners to follow in his chart-busting footsteps. Filled with hit after hit, THE CHASE reads like a primer for the New Country format. Though it maintains a general adherence to the Country tradition behind it, the album boasts a slickness of production and songcraft that have kept Rolls Royce dealers in Nashville busy ever since.From the opening piano-and-vocal intro of the anthemic &quot;We Shall Be Free,&quot; THE CHASE is borne aloft by Brooks's crystal-clear vocals. Whether dipping into the tender strains of &quot;Somewhere Other Than The Night&quot; or swaggering through the pure country stomp of &quot;Dixie Chicken,&quot; Brooks maintains an inspiring control over his instrument. Instantly engaging, his delivery is inspiring in both its precision and its honesty--truly a rare combination. Rounding out this stylistic tour de force, THE CHASE closes out with the one-two punch of the bittersweet &quot;Night Rider's Lament&quot; and the stirring &quot;Face To Face.&quot;

After several years as a small-time bar singer, Garth Brooks burst upon the American country scene in 1989 with this self-named album, produced by Don Williams' producer, Allen Reynolds. He sang songs with an old-time country feel (&quot;Cowboy Bill&quot;) and revived a Jim Reeves' single (&quot;I Know One&quot;), but he was much too young to feel this damn old and the album had a solid, contemporary feel.One of the greatest love songs of recent years, if not all-time, is his own composition &quot;If Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; This album was first in his on-going series of multi-platinum sales.

The album opens with the bluegrassy &quot;Against The Grain,&quot; with its nothing-ventured-nothing-gained theme. It is followed by the cowboy blues &quot;Rodeo,&quot; which features another topic close to the hearts of country music fans, and &quot;What She's Doing Now,&quot; a powerful ballad immersed in steel guitar. Halfway through ROPIN' THE WIND and there's not even a trace of &quot;pop music.&quot; In fact, Garth could even be mistaken for Randy Travis on &quot;Cold Shoulder.&quot; &quot;In Lonesome Dove&quot; is a beautiful Western narrative, while &quot;Papa Loves Mama&quot; talks of truckers, diesels, wine bottles, the penitentiary, and the graveyard; when's the last time you heard a song like that on a Michael Bolton album?Yes, Garth is all country on ROPIN' THE WIND--even though hefervently covers &quot;Shameless,&quot; a song written by his idol Billy Joel. But really, with that twang, the catch in his voice, the steel guitars and the blue-collar themes, how can anyone doubt Garth's devotion to traditional country?

Garbage? Little bits and pieces that pile up in the corners of the house, over the years...ok, it seems to fit. Except that this is no typical heap. Alterna-producer extraordinaire Butch Vig (Nirvana's NEVERMIND, for one) has put together a band to suit his own tastes and eclectic percussive skills, and the result is Garbage's self-titled debut.There are indeed little pieces of everything on GARBAGE. The guitars travel into areas of My Bloody Valentine distortion, while the swinging, sampled loops of noise pound with the same trip-hop tremor as Bjork's solo work. Vocalist Shirley Manson coos and caws, spiralling down from quizical to menacing as she mulls over the various distractions in her life--like &quot;My Lover's Box,&quot; or being &quot;Only Happy When It Rains.&quot;And just when you think you've identified the natural origin of one of Garbage's many pieces, they slip into another mode, a heavier drum sound, more organic instruments--in fact, a different style altogether. Hey, what's in this stuff, anyway?

Pam Tillis' new album THUNDER AND ROSES continues to move her farther away from country and more towards the pop country sound which is more prevailant in country music these days. While not a bad thing, what this album lacks is consistency overall. While it has its shining moments (Please, If I Didnt Love You, Thunder And Roses, etc), it also falls flat on its face in other areas (Be A Man, Jagged Hearts, Space, Tryin', etc). Pam has one of the most original voices in country music, but overall her albums have been inconsistent (save her first album, Sweethearts Dance) and this only adds to that record. However when its good its good, but overall the album will leave you wondering and wanting more than it is.

Having established himself as a primary torchbearer for the romanticism of vintage 70's soul, Maxwell uses his third album EMBRYA to tread the same path as Al Green, walking the tightrope between spirituality and sensuality. On selections with some rather tongue-twisting titles, Maxwell takes the business of love and relationships seriously. Awash in Barry White-influenced arrangements, &quot;I'm You: You Are Me And We Are You (pt me &amp; you)&quot; looks at all of humanity combining to form a higher consciousness.Elsewhere, the young vocalist uses &quot;Luxury: Cococure&quot; to bid adieu to a dead affair and greet the possibilities of getting to know himself, as a creamy beat pulses throughout the song. Between his delicate falsetto, innumerable quiet interludes and his re-teaming with Sade sideman Stuart Matthewman,the romance oozing from this record makes Maxwell's EMBRYA the soundtrack to a quiet storm of erotic interaction.

R is a 2 cd, 29 song set. It has some nice slow jams, as well as some upbeat numbers. Lots of collabs with ppl like Keith Murray, Jay-Z, Vegas Cats, Noreaga, Cam'ron, Foxy Brown, Crucial Conflict, Nas, and Celine Dion. The album deals with a lot of the pressures in life, mainly money and such. Some of my faves include Spendin Money, If IM Wit You, Half On A Baby, When A Woman's Fed Up, One Man, Suicide, Etcetera, If I COuld Turn Back the Hands of Time, What I Feel/Issues, VIP, Did YOu Ever Think, 2nd Kelly, Looking for Love, Dancing With A Rich Man, Im Your Angel and I Believe I Can Fly. He produced, arranged and wrote all the songs on here, proving he is one of the most talented artists out there. Go out and get this cd!

While the phrase, &quot;greatest album&quot; is a useless distinction for the great Stevie Wonder, the material contained herein finds him at a pinnacle of his more introspective songwriting mode. Released between the chart-topping splendor of INNERVISIONS and the monumental SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE, FULFULLINGNESS' FIRST FINALE has spare instrumentation and a particularly personal tone.From gospel-inflected affirmations to the funky classic, &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman,&quot; this music is spirited.Stevie sings out on a seamless array of love declarations (&quot;Creepin&quot;) and social protestations (&quot;You Haven't Done Nothin&quot;). The melodies are simple and evocative, spiced with jazzy harmonies. Between his gentle clavinet work and his inspired synth romps, the man's got a great keyboard palette, and he surely knows how to use it. Throughout, Stevie provides excellent interplay between foreground andbackground, rounding out his vocal and keyboard flights with haunting overdubs. Perhaps most outstanding is the moving reverie, &quot;Heaven Is,&quot; a hand-clapping groove on the divine. Let's face it -- few soulsters can be quite as mesmerizing as Stevie with a line like, &quot;Love is so a-ma-zing.&quot;

INNERVISIONS is Stevie Wonder squarely in the middle of his early-'70s peak. Continuing his ongoing proof that popular music can have a social conscience, INNERVISIONS features some of Wonder's finest pop singles while dealing rigorously with spiritual and sociological issues. &quot;Living For The City&quot;is a detailed ghetto anthem along the lines of his friend Marvin Gaye's &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),&quot; while the wildly funky &quot;Higher Ground&quot; looks to reincarnation and salvation. Both cracked the Top 10 in 1973.The celestial thread continues through &quot;Jesus Children Of America,&quot; which brings together Christianity and transcendental meditation, and &quot;Visions,&quot; a delicate plea for peace and brotherhood that sounds like an homage to John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; (released two years earlier). Successful in pretty much every way--it earned Wonder his first of two straight album-of-the-year Grammys--about the only question left by INNERVISIONS was, how to top it?

Super-smooth R&amp;B star Brian McKnight made a major name for himself throughout the '90s by purveying a singular, immediately recognizable brand of romantic R&amp;B. While he hasn't jumped stylistic ship per se on SUPERHERO, McKnight has taken the opportunity afforded by fame and autonomy to stretch out a bit in whatever sonic direction happens to suit him. For instance, the opening cut is an all-instrumental orchestral interlude that sounds more like the introduction to a Steven Spielberg movie than to an R&amp;B album. The title cut stands out not only for its quirky lyrics (which goso far as to detail the familial lineage of Superman), but for its hard rock guitar hooks, which betray a hitherto-unheard branch of McKnight's musical interests. Despite these forays beyond the usual fare, however, longtime fans will be heartened to know that there are plenty of slow, romantic sizzlers on SUPERHERO, and that McKnight's soulful falsetto can still light a fire as unfailingly as on his previous recordings.

Patty Griffin is an artist I wasn't very aware of, until one day I heard this album playing in a local record store. I was immediately drawn to it, and I bought it. I was not disapointed at all. She has a beautiful, endearing voice that is hard to explain, other than it is beautiful. Lyrically this album is very deep and it moves me greatly. My two favorite tracks are the opening &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Crying&quot;, which are strong songs that have so much emotion and pain in her vocals. Her cover of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, in my opinion, even is better than the original. Other highlights include &quot;Makin Pies&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; and &quot;Long Way Home&quot;. Overall a true gem everyone should listen to.

Deborah Cox finally returns after a long 4 year wait between albums, but it was worth the wait. She proves she has longevity, and the ability to still create music while spreading her wings. This is her debut for J Records. While the first single &quot;Up &amp; Down&quot; failed to garner much attention, there is much here to be pleased about. The title track (which is the second single) is a nice piece of classic soul, as is the bouncy &quot;Givin It Up&quot;. She handles herself well vocally on torch ballads like &quot;Play Your Part&quot;, &quot;Hurt So Much&quot;, and &quot;Starting With You&quot;. She delves into uptempo R&amp;B on &quot;2 Good 2 Be True&quot;, &quot;Oh My Gosh&quot;, &quot;Just A Dance&quot; and more. As well there are bonus remixes, the Chanel Mix for her 2001 club hit &quot;Absolutely Not&quot; and her newest #1 club hit &quot;Mr Lonely&quot;. If you were lucky enough to purchase this and receive the bonus CD, you are in luck! It features remixes of &quot;Up &amp; Down&quot; and &quot;Mr Lonely&quot;. Deborah is back thank goodness, hopefully with her next album we wont have to wait as long. This is a good CD, not as strong as ONE WISH but still a strong album nonetheless. Give it a try, give this girl some props she is very talented!

Toni Braxton is back with her hot new album The Heat. 12 sizzling tracks. Toni has one of the most amazing voices in the industry, she can sing very very low and sounds sexy. He Wasnt Man Enough flew to the top of the charts at its release, but its not the only winner on the cd. I think Fairy Tale should be a single, it is a beautiful song. Spanish Guitar and Just Be A Man about it are great as well. The title track is another great song that should also be a single. Other mentionable songs: Gimme Some, Im Still Breathing, Maybe, Never Just For A Ring. Go out and get it!

Deana Carter's second album Everythings Gonna Be Alright is a bit of a departure from the sound that fans of country music fell in love with, when she hit the scene in 1996 with her album Did I Shave My Legs For This?, but this album is also very good. The album has a more folk sound, and it is more creative than her first album. Country radio and fans werent as willing to accept this, but nevertheless it is good.As on her debut album, the songs on here are very real and you can relate to them. Throughout listening to the album, I felt I understood what Deana was saying and how she was feeling. One of the highlights on this album is the beautiful ballad Color Everywhere, and I believe if released to country radio success would of followed on the charts.Other mentionable songs include People Miss Planes, Never Comin Down, Make Up Your Mind, Angels Working Overtime and the album's first single Absence of the Heart. This is a beautiful album, it may take getting used to but its worth the effort, there is some great material here.

Lee Ann Womack proved with this album that she was more than a one hit wonder, this being her sophmore effort. She is one of the few country artists that truly are &quot;country&quot;, listen and you will see this is true talent.Some Things I Know was released in Sept. 1998, the first single was A Little Past Little Rock, which did very well on the charts, and featued Jason Sellers on background vocals. This album contains various guest artists to lend their talents to the songs, adding glorious and beautiful harmonies to the mix. These guest artists include Vince Gill (Some Things I Know, I Keep Forgetting), Joe Diffie (Id Rather Have What We Had), Buddy Miller and Judy Miller (Dont Tell Me), and Ricky Skaggs and Sharon White (When The Wheels Are Coming Off).Other singles from this album included Now You See Me Now You Dont, and I'll Think Of A Reason Later, which both did very well with country radio and on the charts. Other mentionable songs include the title track (should of been a single), The Man Who Made My Mama Cry, Dont Tell Me and I Keep Forgetting.Lee Ann Womack is truly talented, buy this album and you will see. Her music is very honest and straightforward, and she is true to her country roots. Give it a try!

Machina is a really great cd, a nice return to a more edgier, harder sound that was missing from Adore. From the lead single Everlasting Gaze, to the mellowed, but spirited Try Try Try, there is a story behind this album, and each of the songs paints a picture, putting together a puzzle of a very complex story. Some highlights include Try Try Try, which was released as a single but didnt prosper, but it has an excellent video which is well worth checking out; The Imploding Voice, a little edgier but its really nice; With Every Light, a nice &quot;quiet&quot; song so to speak, very cool; the epic Glass and the Ghost Children clocking at nearly 10 minutes long, and more. The only songs I didn't care for were Raindrops + Sunshowers, and Wound. It would of been nice if Speed Kills was included, like it was on the Japanese Import. I reccomend this album to anyone who appreciates fine music by a band that writes, produces, does all the instrumentaion, overall puts a hell of a lot of effort into their material, to make GOOD music. A nice farewell to the fans, SP you will be missed.

By the time Michael Jackson's album titled Bad was released, there was enough scrutiny from the press against him, and it was just the beginning as we know what all the scrutiny lead to in 1993. With all this new speculation of him being a weird person around 1987, more attention was paid to him, than to his music. So much of this album was overlooked, a mistake on those who did so.Bad became the second best selling album of all time, clocking at 37 million (close behind the #1 selling album of all time, 1982's Thriller at close to 50 million). The album spawned many many hit singles such as the title track, The Way You Make Me Feel, Liberian Girl, Man In The Mirror, I Just Cant Stop Loving You, Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal. The CD version of Bad contains an extra track titled Leave Me Alone, a message for the press. Quincy Jones and Michael worked their magic again with this album, it is so easy to listen to and dance along with the music.Forget what the press said, because truly in his music is the message, and the music is all that matters.

When Aretha Franklin overcame her fear of flying long enough to swing through Europe for a two-week tour, ARETHA IN PARIS was the brilliant by-product. This exquisite slice of Lady Soul's spectacular presence in a live setting came at a time when she was making her mark as the Queen Of Soul. Backed by a full orchestra and a trio of vocalists that included sister Carolyn, Franklin played a set consisting of material that was barely a year old.On Willie Nelson's &quot;Night Life,&quot; the legendary singer can be heard preaching her sorrow to the crowd (she had temporarily separated with husband Ted White that night). Regardless of any pain she may have been going through that night, Franklin's energy never flags as she rips into energetic versions of Ray Charles' &quot;Come Back Baby&quot; and Otis Redding's &quot;Respect.&quot; Most impressive are renditions of her own soul classics such as &quot;Dr. Feelgood (Love Is A Serious Business)&quot; and &quot;I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You),&quot; both which benefit from slow build-ups and spine-tingling finales.

For fans it was a long wait between albums for Shania Twain. Her last album was in 1997, the blockbuster hit COME ON OVER. Now in 2002, Shania is back with a new outlook and a new album. UP! is quite a bit of music to listen to, so it takes a few listens to let it really sink in. 19 tracks in total. However there's two discs, one is the pop disc (red) and the other country (green). The pop disc features more synth and electric guitars, and the country one has more fiddle, banjo and steel guitar. The first single is the infectuous &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good!&quot; which has become a massive hit. &quot;Up!&quot; is the second single, a nice upbeat song. Shania gets serious and emotional on &quot;It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing&quot;, she actually sounds like she's trying to emote some feeling into the song. It's a nice ballad. Another ballad that's a winner is the album closer, &quot;When You Kiss Me&quot;, very reminiscent of her hit &quot;You've Got A Way&quot;. &quot;Nah!&quot; is a fun upbeat song about moving on after a relationship has failed. &quot;(Wanna Get To Know You) That Good!&quot; is another upbeat song about wanting to get to know someone for who they really are. Other highlights among the set include &quot;Forever and For Always&quot;, &quot;I'm Jealous&quot;, &quot;Waiter! Bring Me Water!&quot; and &quot;She's Not Just Another Pretty Face&quot;. The album though is laughable at times, when she tries to be serious making commentary on our society today, such as &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot; which criticizes the money mogul, and &quot;I Ain't Goin Down&quot; which is about a teen pregnancy, another attempt at being serious. Overall though its a fun set, not as strong as THE WOMAN IN ME but its still a fun album to listen to.

Sheryl Crow's newest offering CMON CMON is definately an exceptional album. The album contrasts from night and day, the sunny opening &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, to the closing sorrowful &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, Sheryl covers a lot of ground here. The album is more upbeat than her past excellent album THE GLOBE SESSIONS, but even her carefree songs have their lowpoints, like if you really listen, there's a contradiction between the carefree sound and the lyrics. When I say lowpoint, I mean introspection, not as in the songs being bad quality in lyrics or whatmay. The first single &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is the perfect summer companion, a great song but honestly the weakest song offered here, not to say its a bad song though. &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is one of the best here, very emotional ballad like song. Emmylou Harris offers her background harmony vocals on the acoustic &quot;Weather Channel&quot; which is a song I can deeply relate to, felt like she wrote it just for me. Natalie Maines from Dixie Chicks joines Sheryl on the americana type song &quot;Abilene&quot;. Other guest artists include Gweneth Paltrow, Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley and many more. Other highlights on this seamless set include &quot;Over You&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Diamond Road&quot;. Excellent album, almost my favorite Sheryl album, but her album GLOBE SESSIONS takes that title! Give this one a try! Perfect companion for the summer!

A long wait for new material from George Michael. It's a solid album, he has a great voice and a good ear for what works. However, it sounds a lot like his other albums. He doesn't really grow or expand with each new release. It is a safe bet, but it would be nice for him to experiment a bit more. His last official album (so he says). Highlights include Flawless, Precious Box, Freeek 04, Patience, Cars and Trains, and My Mother Had A Brother.

Kellie Coffey can sing, no doubt there. She's been slated the Celine Dion of country. In fact, she once sang background vocals for Barbra Streisand. On her debut she proves she can sing, and handle a variety of music. Kellie co wrote much of the material on her debut WHEN YOU LIE NEXT TO ME. The title track is a hit already, a song about taking time to appreciate the beuaty of basking in the glow with the one you love. Other highlights include her cover of Wynonna's &quot;Love's Funny That Way&quot; (cowritten by Tina Arena), &quot;Outside Looking In&quot; and &quot;Fingerprints&quot;. A well rounded album overall, and worth checking out.

This album is a bit better than ALL FOR YOU, but it's not saying much. Gone are the thought provoking lyrics and catchy hooks, replaced is a woman who uses blantant sexuality to sell her records. It's not working though. Don't get me wrong, I was once a huge Janet fan, and in some ways I still am. DAMITA JO was very disapointing however. They finally released a good single, the third single "All Nite", which is a great club song and fun to dance to. "I Want You", honey leave emoting to the pros! You can't sing that well so just forget it. "Just A Little While" is ok but not as a single. Good songs: "Slolove", "Island Life", "Damita Jo", "Sexhibition", "Spending Time With You". Bad songs: "Truly", "Moist", "Warmth". 3 stars seems very generous for this bad cd.

No Doubt's members cite a strange variety of musical influences: Kiss, Prince and Madness, to name a few. And it's easy to imagine that their hometown itself, Anaheim, California (home to Disneyland), may have played a part in forming the band's schizophrenic,high-energy sound, which took TRAGIC KINGDOM, the band's second album, on a slow, steady ride up the pop charts. It finally hit No. 1 in December 1996, 14 months after it was released.This is ska-punk-new wave-dance music, with instrumentation ranging from hardcore guitar to mellow, reggae-style horns. Singer Gwen Stefani's voice is by turns peppy, almost adolescent (&quot;Spiderwebs&quot;) and emotionally wailing; she can sound a lot like Concrete Blonde's Johnette Napolitano (&quot;Just A Girl&quot;). When Stefani sings, &quot;I'm just a girl, little ol' me/Don't let me out of your sight,&quot; she does so without a hint of girlishness; her voice is all attitude, with a warbling edge of melodrama. For the most part, these are happy songs, though No Doubt do get philosophical on &quot;Different People&quot;: &quot;Once in a while I sit back/And think about the planet/Most of the time I trip on it/To kick back and think of how massive it all is.&quot;

Cher made a huge comeback in 1998 with her dance hit Believe, which soon became a club anthem with these remixes. This is the cd single, with 10 tracks, 9 of which are remixes. The remixes are done by Club 69, Peter Rauhofer, Phat N Phunky, Brian Higgins and Matt Gray, Marytn Norris, Jon Dixon, Wayne G and Andy Alder and more. The remixes are nice but really some sound quite alike, although I really did like the dub. Nice single to have if you like this song and want to hear its remixes, and by the way 3 stars is considered good.

Little Sparrow is the newest offering from Dolly Parton. She describes it as a cross between her Grass is Blue album, and her Coat of Many Colors album. The sound is very pure, real, very bluegrass and mountain sounding. Her voice has never been so beautiful, still in its delicate and angelic nature. The album starts off with a very acoustic like track, the title track, the harmonies are tight and angelic. Shine is a cover of the Collective Soul hit, which is one of my favorites on the album. The beauty of the album is in the instruments, and how Dolly's voice lends itself towards the music.I Don't Believe Youve Met My Baby is a beautiful song thats another one of my favorites. The next track will always remain one of my favorite Dolly songs, My Blue Tears. Simply one of the most beautiful songs Dolly has ever sang in her whole career in my opinion. Next follows a cover of Seven Bridges Road which is very beautiful. Bluer Pastures and A Tender Lie are other favorites of mine, very simply in arrangement and Dolly sounds simply beautiful. I Get A Kick Out Of You is a great song, a little upbeat and fun.The next song is a very sad song. Mountain Angel, the longest running track on the album clocking at nearly 7 minutes is a very song, very well the masterpiece of this album. Marry Me is a great upbeat song, very bluegrassy like. Down From Dover is a remake of her own classic, still as timeless as ever. The Beautiful Lie is a nice song as well, very beautiful. In The Sweet By And By is a very slow beautiful song. The Little Sparrow Reprise closes the album.Little Sparrow is by far one of the best albums I have heard in a while. This is proof that it pays to wait for good material, as Dolly always delivers. This album continues to show her growth, from personal freedom of a major record label. She still maintains to make music the way she wants to, even though radio refuses to play her music, well its their loss because this is pure gold. Dolly says she will continue to do music like this, and I can't complain, Little Sparrow is a breath of fresh air.

Those kings of cinematic quirkiness, the Coen brothers, fashioned their film O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? as a contemporary adaption of Homer's Odyssey, centering around a group of American chain-gang prisoners. The film's earthy Southern setting makes it a natural for a bluegrass-oriented soundtrack, for which producer T-Bone Burnett picked thecream of the country crop. &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby,&quot; for example, is a summit meeting of some of the finest contemporary female country vocalists (Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, and Alison Krauss). The old school isn't forgotten either, as evidenced by a chilling a cappella rendering of &quot;O Death,&quot; courtesy of Ralph Stanley, and by the closing cut, where the Stanley Brothers issue an elegant plea to heaven with &quot;Angel Band.&quot;

Im Alright is the long awaited sophmore release from Jo Dee Messina, who flew onto the country scene in 1996 with Heads Carolina Tails California, Your Not In Kansas Anymore, Do You Wanna Make Something Of It, etc. She made a big comeback and had a lot of success with this album. The first single Bye Bye flew to #1, then the second single Im Alright followed suit and hit #1 as well, as did the third single Stand Beside Me. The fourth single, a cover of the Dottie West song Lesson In Leavin, peaked at #2, just barely missing #1. So she had three consecutive #1 songs with this album. The fifth single Because You Love Me didnt fare as well, but is just as memorable as the others. Other mentionable tracks include the tearful Even God Must Get The Blues, the fun No Time For Tears and Silver Thunderbird, and I Know A Heartache and Cover Me, all songs on this album are excellent, there is not one bad song. This is a must have if you love country, because there is talent here. Also check out her newest album Burn, which is good too.

En Vogue's latest effort is their best in years, even better than their previous album EV3. Still without Dawn Robinson, these ladies still know how to make music, good music. The album samples many classical pieces and intertwines them into wonderful melodies with beats and rhythms. En Vogue has never sounded this good, their harmonies shine on songs like Riddle, No No No, Falling In Love, Love U Crazay, Love Wont Take Me Out, Sad But True and more. This one is definately worth a listen, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Bedtime Stories is one of Madonna's best works (alongside Erotica, Ray Of Light, Like A Prayer, etc). This time Madonna goes R&amp;B, and she does it very well. Survival is a fun song, kind of autobiographical for Madonna about surviving despite what everyone puts against her. Secret is the first single, with a sing along hook that you will always remember. I'd Rather Be Your Lover is a heavy R&amp;B type song that will make you wanna dance, like Don't Stop (which in fact was a single on some radio stations that didnt want to play Human Nature). Inside of Me is a lush ballad which is very dreamy. Human Nature is the controversial song where Madonna faces her critics who are judgemental about everything she does. Forbidden Love is a jazzy type song. Love Tried To Welcome Me is another lush ballad and she sounds wonderful. Santuary is another beautiful song where she sings very well, which leads into the title track Bedtime Story which is a preview in a way of things to come (Ray Of Light), Bjork wrote this song and its the highlight of the album in my opinion. The album closes with Take A Bow, a ballad in which Babyface wrote and lends his voice to.Let Down Your Guard was the bside to Secret, and everyone says its a bad song but i like it. Its a very R&amp;B influenced song and its fun. This album is basically a light headed fun album, with the occasional sad songs. Its a great album and I highly reccomend it.

This is the import copy of Songbook A Collection of Hits, a much more complete version that the domestic. It contains the exact same 12 tracks as the US version, but it also contains 6 extra tracks that were not available on the US version. The US version missed a lot of her hits, like Believe Me Baby (I Lied), You Can Sleep While I Drive, On A Bus To St. Cloud, etc, and although this collection is still missing some of her hits (ex: Everybody Knows) it is more complete.The three new songs did very well, How Do I Live, In Anothers Eyes and Perfect Love all hit #1. When this CD was released Trisha was one of the hottest things going in country, in my opinion she still is, but the industry tends to focus on newer acts and more popular ones, but I think Trisha is the best. The CD also contains her hits like The Song Remembers When, Wrong Side Of Memphis, The Woman Before Me, Thinkin About You, Down On My Knees, Shes In Love With The Boy, Walkaway Joe, XXX's and OOO's, Like we Never Had A Broken Heart, and the extra tracks are A Lover Is Forever, Believe Me Baby I Lied, On A Bus To St Cloud, You Can Sleep While I Drive, The Flame, and Save The Land. Its a pretty penny but its worth it if you want a more complete Trisha Yearwood collection.

I Get Lonely, the third release from her album The Velvet Rope is a very soulful song, with such emotion in it. The remixes are great, and an added treat is the added remix of Together Again. I love the remix with Blackstreet, they really made it come alive, though it was alive well before they were added. The club mix is great too. A must have for fans.

This is Whitney Houston and these are her greatest hits. A 2 cd set, divided by uptempo and ballads. Disc One is the ballads, a cd titled Cool Down and Disc Two is Throw Down, the uptempo songs (more like remixes). We all know Whitney for her voice, that powerful voice with so much emotion. The ballads are all here, from the beggining of her career in 1985, to her Bodyguard days, to her current hits, its all here. The second disc consists mostly of remixes which I admit is a downer, because it ruins some of them. Some songs sound so much better as remixes (example Its Not Right But Its Okay in my opinion was much better with this remix than the original) but what is lacking is the original versions. There are 4 new songs: Same Script Different Cast (with Deborah Cox) which is one of my favorites, Could I Have This Kiss Forever (with Enrique Iglesias), Fine (really good upbeat song), and If I Told You That (with George Michael) which is a more spiced up version than the one on the My Love Is Your Love album. This is a must for fans, even if the remixes are somewhat dissapointing.

This is a good follow up to Carolyn Dawn Johnson's successful debut album ROOM TO A VIEW. The first single, &quot;Simple Life&quot; (the only track she did not pen on the album), was a top 15 hit and it should have been #1 in my opinion. Hopefully her next single, the ballad, &quot;Die of a Broken Heart&quot; fares a bit better. If you liked her first album, you'll enjoy this one too. &quot;Head Over High Heels&quot; has hit written all over it, so does &quot;Squeezin the Love Out of You&quot;. &quot;He's Mine&quot; and the title track are great too. Other highlights include &quot;I'll Let You Go&quot;, &quot;My Little Secret&quot; and &quot;We Talked&quot;. Overall a strong album!

At first when I got this maxi when it came out, I didnt like the remixes. I thought, how could you remix such a great song as Ray of Light, one of her best. After listening to the single more and more I grew to like the remixes, they are very dance/techno and each stand on their own. I learned to like them after I realized that nothing will ever touch Ray of Light, but these are nice attributes to the original, the classic.

This is one of Dolly's less successful albums from the 90's, only spawning one real hit, the duet Romeo which includes a array of country singers as guest stars. The album is stunning though, with some of her best music. The album has a lot of guest artists, who have nothing but good things to say about Dolly in the liner notes of the album booklet. These guests include Billy Dean, Trisha Yearwood, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Tanya Tucker, Pam Tillis, Billy Ray Cyrus, Collin Raye, Kathy Mattea and much more! However the guest artists do not take away from the music, as there is plenty of Dolly here! The album lasts for 12 tracks, which are some of her best songs. Favorites include You Got Me Over (A Heartache Tonight) (with Billy Dean), Full Circle, Slow Dancing With THe Moon, and the remake of Put A Little Love In Your Heart. All of the songs are classic though. I highly reccomend it!

I bought this album back in November (the import version) and I was really surprised at Kylie's new sound. The album had to grow on me, but it definately did, and this is one of my favorite Kylie albums now. The album has an urban feel to it, lots of R&amp;B influences and less of that electro pop/dance sound her previous albums like FEVER have sported. The first single was &quot;Slow&quot; and it may not have catched on, but it's a great song. The new single is &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; and it's really catchy and hopefully will be a smash hit. I think the next single should be &quot;Obsession&quot; because it has a great hook and melody and has hit written all over it. &quot;Loving Days&quot; is an excellent song, one of my favorites on the disc, and probably the best ballad she's ever done. &quot;Chocolate&quot; is another amazing song, one of my all time favorite songs. &quot;Still Standing&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Sweet Music&quot; are other great songs. I also really like the closing &quot;After Dark&quot;. The bonus tracks &quot;Cruise Control&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel&quot; are super as well. This album has a more mature sound from Kylie, and in my opinion, some really great lyrics. A great album!!

It's amazing that Britney Spears continues to make so called &quot;music&quot;. She has no talent, she can't sing. Yes she can dance, but that's not enough to save her. She is an empire, and there are very smart people that keep her in the public eye, which helps her get attention and the constant talk around the water cooler each day. But when it comes down to the music, what is there? Nothing. There is absolutely no substance on this album. This isn't real music, can you honestly hear any real instruments on the album? No because its all synthesized and overproduced. Anyone could have made this album, and a lot of people could have made this a better album than she did. She wants to show she's all provocative and edgy, but she's not. Every album she has this new image, and she completely contradicts herself. Honey, concentrate on making real music that means something, cause this is nothing but a mess.

Joe is one of the hottest R&amp;B stars around today. His smooth voice will make you melt, and his music is beautiful and meaningful. His first single from the album is I Wanna Know, a song pleading to please his woman the best way he can. His newest single is Stutter, which is already a huge hit. The album also features the remix of his duet with Mariah Carey, called Thank God I Found You, the remix found on this CD has Nas and is called Make it Last. There is also a song with NSync called I Believe In You. Other standouts include the sensual Table For Two, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand and So Beautiful. Worth the money, check it out! You wont be disapointed!

Miss Congeniality is a very entertaining movie about an FBI agent who goes undercover to protect the most beautiful women in the world, at the Miss America Pagent. The story follows this woman, who is less than elegant, and watch her transform into this beautiful woman. I wont give away the whole story because its a very funny and entertaining movie, both Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt shine in this one. Its a must have if you enjoy non stop laughter and entertainment, this is your movie.

It might seem odd to some that this compilation was released, especially since her first compilation of hits, #1's, was released in late 1998, only three years prior to the release of this one. GREATEST HITS includes all of those #1 hits from the album #1's, but as well songs that did not peak as high. It's a pretty comprehensive collection of hits of her career with Columbia Records, from her 1990 debut MARIAH CAREY up to her 1999 album RAINBOW. It's nice to have songs like &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot;, &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; and others included, since they are just as good as gold as her #1 hits as well. New fans will enjoy this collection, it's a good place to start, and avid Carey fans will want to invest in this one as well!

Bad Girl is a great song, it expresses a lot of feelings that many artists would have trouble expressing in their whole career. This single is nice to have, with the extended mix of Bad Girl and some Fever remixes. The Fever remixes are a little repetitive so its kinda a waste for those. They should of just released Bad Girl with the album version, an edit, the extended, maybe a few mixes and a bside, and just left Fever to be released as its own single. However its still nice to have this one.

There are 6 remixes of Deeper and Deeper, an extended version of Bad girl, and 5 Erotica remixes. Some are dubs, bonus beats, remixes. Its a wonderful single with great remixes. I highly reccomend you get this single, even if it costs a little extra, its worth the money.

Everywhere We Go is perhaps Kenny Chesney's most complete work to date, in my opinion its his best cd yet. Each of the 11 songs are hits in their own right. What I Need To Do is a great ballad which didnt do too well on the charts, but its a great song you will love. How Forever Feels is that fun summer time song that you know and love. You Had Me From Hello was the big hit of this album, one of his best ballads to date. Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is a lovers plea, a very beautiful song once again showcasing his romantic side (like on You Had Me From Hello and many of his songs). Life is Good is a good song to listen to when you are feeling down. Everywhere We Go is another romantic song you will love. She Thinks My Tracktor's Sexy is a fun song to sing along with and dance, definately a standout on the album. Other mentionable tracks include the duet with Randy Travis titled Baptism, and the honest A Woman Knows. This is a must have you wont regret it!

Take A Bow was one of those ballads fans of Madonna, and fans of music learned to love. Take A Bow being on Bedtime Stories, her 1994 R&amp;B album, it is fitting that she released R&amp;B remixes of this song. They are good. Nothing could touch the original but these are nice to have. However the instrumentals of the original and the InDaSoul Mix weren't very nessesary. A nice thing for Madonna fans to have.

The Judds ended their reign as one of the top vocal groups in country music in their final concert in December 1991, when Naomi was very ill, a fatal disease. She spended time writing books and doing motivational speaking, while Wynonna went on to become a very successful solo artist. For the New Years Eve concert, the last of the millenium, and entering a new one, The Judds reunited one last time for a final tour. Here it is for all the fans to enjoy!Singing their signature hits like &quot;Mama He's Crazy&quot;, &quot;Girls Night Out&quot;, &quot;Grandpa (Tell Me About The Old Days&quot;, &quot;Why Not Me&quot;, &quot;Love Can Build A Bridge&quot;, &quot;Love Is Alive&quot; and many many more, as well as some of Wy's solo hits like &quot;I Saw The Light&quot;, &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot;, &quot;My Strongest Weakness&quot;, &quot;The Wyld Unknown&quot;, as well as some new songs from her album NEW DAY DAWNING like &quot;Can't Nobody Love You Like I Do&quot;, &quot;Tuff Enough&quot; and her hit &quot;Come Some Rainy Day&quot;This is the perfect collection of songs old and new for fans of the Judds. It is excellent and there is so much talent. Ashley Judd introduces them. This is a must have for any fan who loves the Judds and wants to recapture that magic that lived on throughout the 80's and early 90's. Its wonderful to hear from these talented singers again!

Jamiroquai is back with a new album, called A FUNK ODYSSEY. There are 10 tracks, with a bonus hidden track. The album is a nice collection of songs, that fans will be sure to love. It may not be as good as say TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING, but why compare to a masterpiece album? A FUNK ODYSSEY adds new elements to their music, without trying to be like any of their other albums. The album in many songs has a disco feel to them, slightly, with the same vibe we get from Jamiroquai's songs. Highlights from the album include Picture of my Life, Little L, Black Crow and Feel so Good. I highly reccomend you try this album, its a nice surprise!

Brandy's 1998 album NEVER SAY NEVER is truly an album to own if you are a fan of the R&amp;B genre. This is when Darkchild was at his best, a flavor he lost in the years to follow. The first single, and title track with Monica, is the perfect song to introduce people to the album with. Monica and Brandy really compliment each other on this tale of betrayal and mistrust. &quot;Angel In Disguise&quot; is a funky set, with some catchy lyrics and a memorable hook. &quot;Learn The Hard Way&quot; is also very cutting edge too. &quot;Almost Doesn't Count&quot; is a nice midtempo song, with a tint of regret painted in it, and telling the man how it is in the relationship. Brandy treats us to some top notch ballads, namely &quot;Truthfully&quot;, &quot;Put That On Everything&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, which she shines on. &quot;Happy&quot; is a really funky R&amp;B jam which would have been great as a single. &quot;One Voice&quot; is very gospel like, and Brandy has never sounded better. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is also a really nice ballad. She ends with a cover of Bryan Adams' &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You)&quot;, which she handles gracefully. NEVER SAY NEVER is where its at, give it a listen!

Although Hole would eventually score major hits with more pop-accessible material (1994's LIVE THROUGH THIS and 1998's CELEBRITY SKIN), the band's early work, such as its 1991 debut, PRETTY ON THE INSIDE, was more raw and punk- and hardcore-based. Along with L7, Babes in Toyland, and Bikini Kill, Hole was part of the early-'90s &quot;riot grrrl&quot; movement, which merged abrasive music with feminist lyrics and served as a much-needed antidote to the party-hearty late-'80s glam metal scene. Co-produced by Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon and alternative knob twirler Don Fleming, PRETTY ON THE INSIDE was a venomous and cacophonous debut.Although Courtney Love would eventually pen some of alternative rock's best-known songs of the '90s (&quot;Doll Parts,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Skin,&quot; etc.), she was still honing her craft on PRETTY ON THE INSIDE. Songs such as &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;were snarling confrontational rants, while such other frenzy-filled compositions as &quot;Garbage Man,&quot; &quot;Good Sister/Bad Sister,&quot; and the title track easily kept the rage at a boiling point. PRETTY ON THE INSIDE would be the one and only album to feature Hole's original lineup, which consisted of Love on vocals/guitar, Eric Erlandson on guitar, Jill Emery on bass, and Caroline Rue on drums.

Eagle When She Flies, Dolly's first album in the 90s, is a collection of songs that are hit and miss. The album does have its strong tracks (The soaring Eagle When She Flies, simple Silver and Gold, accepting type song Family, Dreams Do Come True, etc) but it falls short on some songs (What A Heartache, Best Woman Wins). This is still a nice album, as Dolly always releases quality music, she has the best voice in country music (even to date).

White Limozeen, released in 1989, was a return back to country music. During the late 1970's and most of the 1980's, Dolly was crossing over to pop, both successfully and unsuccessfully (still making great music though). This is her return to country, where she belongs. A wise move, as this album carried many hits for Dolly. From the fun Whyd You Come In Here Lookin Like That, the sweet Yellow Roses, to the powerful He's Alive (one of her BEST!) and the title cut. It doesnt end there, the album has some of her best songs, showcasing some of her best singing. Time For Me To Fly and Take Me Back To The Country are fun songs which in essence represent her coming back to country music, The Moon The Stars And Me is a beautiful country ballad, sure to please. Overall this album is a must have for fans, it contains some of Parton's best music from that era in her career!

Unless you count Ringo Starr's SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY, 1983's WHAT'S NEW, the first of three albums Linda Ronstadt recorded with arranger Nelson Riddle, is perhaps the first major attempt by a bona fide rock artist to come to terms with the Great American Songbook of the Gershwins, Rodgers &amp; Hart, Cole Porter and the other great songwriters who set the musical tone for American life and love before the advent of rock &amp; roll. Possessed of considerable yet unpretentious vocal chops, Ronstadt is a good candidate for this formidable task. She clearly reveres this music and acquits herself winningly by turning in a well-chosen, well-performed set of familiar Sinatra and Billie Holiday-associated songs. Riddle's arrangements lightly support the singer and never upstage her. This late in the game, the master arranger's famous taste is fully in evidence.

Garbage's third album finds the bi-national quartet dispelling accusations that have dogged them since the release of their self-titled 1995 debut of merely being a loose collective of producers and a hand-picked singer. Feeding off Shirley Manson's continually underrated lyrical contributions, this alt-rock-electronic hybrid have come up with a collection of songs that combine introspective observations with an eclectic sound that draws from a broad swath of influences. Opening with &quot;Shut Your Mouth,&quot; a clattering, rap-flavored track that reflects the band's Outkast influence, Garbage goes on a wild ride that finds them also touching on lush, '60s girl group arrangements (&quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot;) and shimmering dream-pop (&quot;Drive You Home&quot;).Unsurprisingly, BEAUTIFUL GARBAGE gets its edge from Manson's trademark independent streak. On &quot;Silence Is Golden,&quot; the fiery Scot rails like PJ Harvey against attempts to silence her in the face of an unspeakable violation while the jittery electro-pop of &quot;Untouchable&quot; finds Manson tearing an adulterous paramour a new one. Elsewhere, Garbage dabbles with gender-bending issues with a Missy Elliott-flavored twist (&quot;Androgyny&quot;) only to go further on the new-wave-fueled tale of a &quot;sissy boy&quot; and his fair-weather friends (&quot;Cherry Lips [Go Baby Go]&quot;). Garbage once again reinvents the parameters of pop.

At first I wasn't too pleased with this cd. It was a long wait between Long Stretch of Lonesome (which is excellent) and this album. I found this album wasn't up to par. However after listening to it again, it has that classic Patty us fans just love. There is some great stuff on here, namely MY Heart Will Never Break This Way Again, That's The Kind of Mood I'm In, Strong Heart and Pieces on the Ground. It is a bit different sounding, but its trademark Patty Loveless. You will enjoy this album, if you dont at first, give it a try, you will be surprised.

Ill admit first off, I love Patty Loveless she is a great singer. This album was her first real studio album since 1997's Long Stretch of Lonesome. So it was almost 3 years since her last. Thats a long wait, and after such a great album, one of her best yet, theres Strong Heart. Theres the fun Thats The Kind of Mood Im In which is the standout, but otherwise the collection seems to drift into nowhere and the songs dont seem to flow well together. I found it personally a little disapointing after such a long wait, and after such a great album as Long Stretch of Lonesome.

...as people made it out to be. Sure Mariah isn't the best actress, but this movie was well done. The setting in the 80's was perfect, it wasn't fake looking or cheap, Mariah and the producers of this movie really captured the essence of the 80's with this movie. The music used (the songs that were used as background music, not the ones on her album GLITTER) were very significant of the 80's for sure. The songs she recorded for the soundtrack GLITTER speak mountains after seeing the movie, it makes far more sense now after seeing it. When you hear her sing &quot;Reflections (Care Enough)&quot;, a song about wondering why her mother gave her up, and if she really cares, is heartwrenching and I think was an important part of the movie. &quot;Never Too Far&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs Mariah has written (and sang) since 1997's BUTTERFLY album. The movie was good, I think its important to see it for yourself and forget about the critics, because its not as bad as everyone made it out to be. Give it a chance.

This 2002 compilation is a must have CD for Streisand fans. It includes all of her big duet hits, along with two new tracks! One of the newly recorded track is a duet with Josh Groban called &quot;All I Know Is Love&quot;, magnificent. The other new track is a duet with Barry Manilow entitled &quot;I Won't Be The One To Let Go&quot;, another great track. The duets on this album show her diversity as an artist, from classic ballads to uptempo disco, she covers it all. My favorite duets here include Guilty with Barry Gibb, What Kind of Fool with Barry Gibb, I Finally Found Someone with Bryan Adams, Tell Him with Celine Dion, No More Tears with Donna Summer, and Make No Mistake (He's Mine) with Kim Carnes. Other duet partners include Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Don Johnson, Vince Gill, Michael Crawford, July Garland, and more. This is the perfect gift or CD for any fan of Barbra's.

If you are an older Prince fan, I'm sure you have this album. If you are a new fan, this is one you must get. Sign 'O' The Times is arguably Prince's more complete, and essential best work he has ever recorded in his entire career. This is one of my favorite albums. As usual his music is innovative and groundbreaking, trendsetting. Prince was always ahead of the game, this album is just another reason. Lyrically this album is his best in my opinion, he's always been a great lyricist but its often been misled in some way, this album we find songs that are so poignantely written, so significant of the times and the world. The mix of funk, R&amp;B and rock make it an eclectic mix of music. The 2 CDs are great, 16 tracks. Some of the tracks are lengthy (It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night clocking at 9 minutes) but I wouldn't change a thing about this album, it contains some of his best songs and it comes from the best part of his career, where he was making the best music. My favorite track is If I Were Your Girlfriend, it just elaborates on the relationship talk and says things you normally wouldn't hear a man say, very intimate and personal. Anyway this is a must have for your Prince collection (if you don't have it), there is no filler, just great songs all throughout.

Celine Dion took a hiatus in 1999, leaving fans with her collection ALL THE WAY A DECADE OF SONG. Now she's back with her first studio album since 1997's LETS TALK ABOUT LOVE. With a new child, and a new outlook on life, she's better than ever. A NEW DAY HAS COME is a collection of songs which both inspire and make you think about how precious life really is. This time she experiments more with other types of music, from straight up pop (When The Wrong One Loves You Right, Rain Tax) to Cher-like electronica (Sorry For Love), and more. The first single A New Day Has Come appears in both radio remix form and album version form on here. Its both inspiring and beautiful. The song Goodbye's (The Saddest Word) is a touching ballad about mother-daughter relationships. Celine also covers the Etta James classic At Last, and Nat King Cole's Nature Boy. While she does a good job, I would have preferred if they weren't on the cd, they just don't suit this album. Ten Days is another song which still needs to grow on me. The Greatest Reward is a beautiful song as well. With NEW DAY Celine has learned to control her voice so she's not over exerting it in every song, she uses lots of restraint which is refreshing to hear, then on some songs she tears it up! Overall A NEW DAY HAS COME is almost a new Celine, its a good album and fun to listen to. Other highlights include the inspiring I'm Alive, the catchy Right In Front Of You, and the beautiful ballad Have You Ever Been In Love.

I don't care if it's unpopular to like Jessica Simpson, but I actually quite enjoy this album from her. I think she has a nice voice, but she could benefit from better material. Not that this is bad, it's definately a step up from IRRESISTIBLE which was overproduced and some of the songs didn't really suit her. I also think her ditzy image works against her, and will overshadow her career and her true talent. I don't think it was necessary to remake "Angels" and "Take My Breath Away", but she does a decent enough job of them in my opinion. "With You" was a good choice for a single, it's infectuous and poppy and just very nice. There are some really touching ballads. "You Don't Have To Let Go" is very sweet, it makes me think of my father who recently passed away. "Underneath", "Loving You", "Everyday See You" and "I Have Loved You" are other nice ballads. The title track is a good pop song, and so is the dancy "Forbidden Fruit". Overall I like this album.

Jessica Simpson has a great voice, but she just can't seem to cut a break. While other artits from the teen pop diva era of 1999 have moved on to even more success, Simpson seems to be languishing in the background. The only way she seems to attract attention is through her reality based TV show &quot;The Newlyweds&quot; where she acts like a ditz. It's a shame, because I think the show is ruining her credibility as an artist. IN THIS SKIN is the typical MOR you would come to except, not to say it's bad, but it's nothing different. Simpson wrote 9 of the 11 tracks here. The first single was the bland Diane Warren ballad &quot;Sweetest Sin&quot;. She shows her strength on ballads like &quot;I Have Loved You&quot;, &quot;Underneath&quot;, &quot;You Don't Have To Let Go&quot;, and &quot;Everyday See You&quot;. The title track comes off as a little trite, as she sings about being normal and wanting to feel comfortable in her skin. The album isn't bad per se, but it could be better. She needs to focus on her music and come out with something that will set her apart, and let people take notice to her great voice.

Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme) is a great single! It includes 3 remixes of the song, the original song, and the bside Crybaby. The song is about being proud of who you are, and not letting people get you down. This is a very positive song, much like her 1993 hit Hero. Too bad this song isn't doing well on the charts, because it's a breath of fresh air. Crybaby is a great song too. Definately check this single out, and her Rainbow album while you're at it!

This is the second half of the LOVE IS HELL album, which was intended to be the official follow up to his 2001 GOLD album, but the label wanted a more contemporary album so that was how ROCK N ROLL came to be. This is excellent music. Working with John Porter who produced, the album has a great sound. It's hard to say if I like Part 1 or Part 2 of this EP better, they are both great. This one in particular, has some really great songs, namely &quot;City Rain, City Streets&quot;, &quot;Hotel Chelsea Nights&quot;, &quot;English Girls Approximately&quot;, and &quot;I See Monsters&quot;. The only song that I'm iffy about is &quot;Thank You Louise&quot;, but it's not that bad. The songwriting is great, and you can tell Ryan is really in this music, his heart, his soul, everything.

This is basically a holiday single with remixes of All I Want For Christmas Is You, originally from her 1994 album MERRY CHRISTMAS. There is a remix of the song featuring Lil Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri, a club mix of Joy To The World, and others. However, the must have song in buying this CD is &quot;O Holy Night 2000&quot; her freshly made rendition of this holiday classic. It was on her 1994 album MERRY CHRISTMAS, but this version is more vocally impressive and it shows her strength in vocals. I think she invented a note, she seems to fly off the piano at the end. Its a beautiful song. This is a pricey CD, but if you're a huge fan you won't want to miss this one!

This is a beautiful song by Mary J Blige, I love it so much. Diane Warren out did herself in writing this one, and once again Mary shined. The remixes are nice, especially the R&amp;B Garden mix, but the real winner is the original mix. Radio mix isnt bad either. I reccomend this single.

Can't Nobody Love You (Like I Do) was the lead single from her 2000 album NEW DAY DAWNING. It is a lush ballad with nice arrangements and beautiful vocals. I was reading in Naomi Judd's book LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE that she was amazed Wynonna could sing ballads about heartbreak even though she's never experienced it. Its true she has rich vocals that just have emotion pouring out of them. She has experienced heartbreak and joy by this time and this ballad is truly one of her best. The second song Help Me is a nice song too, a cover of the Joni Mitchell song, she does it very tastefully and well, I really like it. I reccomend this single to anyone who doesn't have the album yet or likes the song, its a great song and its a shame country radio didn't play it more.

We all know Britney Spears. As soon as Baby One More Time, her first single hit the airwaves, soon everyone knew who she was. Then other singles followed, soon she was the newest sensation around.The problem with Britney, is her lack of originality. There is promising material on this album (Baby One More Time, Sometimes, Born To Make You Happy, etc) but it falls short many many times and isn't always listenable.Britney often credits Janet Jackson as her role model, which I think is lovely. I am a huge Janet fan, she is the bomb. There is no one like Janet out there, so why does Britney try to be like her so much? There is such a thing as flattery, but then there is such a thing as copying someone else's style. I've seen Brit on television, at awards shows. At one awards show she completely copied Janet's &quot;Miss You Much&quot; chair dance, to a tee. She cannot compare to Miss Jackson, she never will. Luckily Janet is the type of artist who creates her own style, she is original. Perhaps Britney should try to be original with her dancing, with her material. And please try to be more mature in your quality of songs, which she is not.Overall, Britney Spears first album deserves a listen, but will not guarantee total enjoyment with its repetitive lyrics and music.

Trisha surprised everyone with this album. With the recent changes in country music, many speculated she would follow the same route as Shania Twain and Faith Hill, and do a pop country album. This is the total opposite. Trisha has created a masterpiece in this album, maintaining her country roots, still providing some of the most satisfying music in her entire career.The album's title track, also the first single, is an honest song about women, so brutal in its honesty its definately a stand out on the album. There is so much more as well though! The second single, Where Are You Now featured Mary Chapin Carpenter and Kim Richey on background vocals, it was explosive when they performed this song on the CMA's last year.Country radio didn't exactly grab at this album, but honestly this music is better than some of the music played on radio today, country radio is afraid to play Trisha because she decided to stay country, which doesnt fit the mold of country music today. That doesn't matter this album is excellent.Other notable tracks include upbeat numbers like One Love and Too Bad Youre No Good, tender ballads like Sad Eyes, I Did, Im Still Alive and When A Love Song Sings The Blues. She also finally has done a cover of a Linda Ronstadt song, which she was always afraid to do. No need to be afraid she does the song justice, its a wonderful cover of Linda Ronstadt's Try Me Again.If you want an album filled with great songs, no filler, this is the one. Who cares what country radio thinks, Trisha is a great artist, listen to this album and you will agree.

Real Live Woman is Trisha's first album since 1998's Where Your Road Leads (another spectacular album). Everyone suspected she would go pop like a lot of country artists have, but on this collection, she decided to stay country. The songs are very eclectic and have a gritty feel to them. Some favorites include Where Are You Now, I Did, One Love, When A Sad Song Sings the Blues, Real Live Woman, Try Me Again, and many others. This is true country! Go out and get it!

Goldie's Timeless CD is a CD I was given for my birthday this year. As a fan of Drum &amp; Bass, Jungle, and other forms of Electronica, I wasn't displeased. This is quite the album. It defines the genre of music, literally. Goldie proves there are no boundaries and no rules to follow. It all flows nicely. The 21 minute mini masterpiece &quot;Timeless&quot; which features 3 tracks i. Inner City Life ii. Pressure and iii. Jah is just the beginning of the icing on this cake. The other seven tracks are part of this journey and compliment each other quite well. Each track is distinct, yet not too different. &quot;Saint Angel&quot; &quot;Sensual&quot; &quot;Kemistry&quot; and &quot;Sea of Tears&quot; are other highlights, although I assure you there are no bad tracks on this cd! This is a nice buy, especially for fans of Drum &amp; Bass and Jungle, which he pretty much began with this cd. You'll see why its such a must have once you listen to it!

Greatest Hits is the long awaited collection from Paula Abdul, over 5 years since her last album, 1995's Head Over Heels. This collection highlights some of Paula's biggest hits in her career. Starting from her Forever Your Girl days, we are offered the hits Straight Up, Cold Hearted, Forever Your Girl, The Way That You Love Me, Knocked Out and Opposites Attract, all in remix edit form, like in the videos you would see on MTV. Track 7 is a song previously unavailable called Bend Time Back Around. Then we continue with the hits, from her 1991 Spellbound album: Rush Rush, Promise of a New Day, Blowing Kisses In The Wind, and Vibeology, all in their edit forms as well. One track that is much missed is the overlooked hit Will You Marry Me, which failed to make it on the collection. The album continues with a few hits from her Head Over Heels album, an album full of promise that didn't take flight. These hits include the R&amp;B remix of My Love Is For Real, Crazy Cool, and an oddity (since it was never a single), If I Were Your Girl. Following suit is a Megamix Medley, a 9 and a half minute song where her hits are thrown together in a remix medley. Its ok but I would of rather seen songs that didn't make the collection (Will You Marry Me?, etc) instead of a megamix. The album closes with a song called Crazy Love, which was on the Japanese import of Head Over Heels. Overall this 16 track collection is a nice reminder of Paula, who has yet to release a new album (we are waiting Paula!), with some of her best hits all in one collection. A must have.

George Michael has made a classic with this album. Older has a very definitive sound, very original that could not be made by anyone else. The music is powerful, it has the ability to open your mind and through his thoughts that are expressed you get a sense of his perception of life. The music is honest and straightforward, and this album is a tad depressing but its such beautiful music. Through listening to it you can hear the pain he went through when his friend died years ago, this is what he was dealing with. Highlights from this cd include Jesus To A Child, Older, You Were Loved and Fastlove, although all songs are spectacular. This is the importe version with a bonus cd, called Upper. Worth the extra money. I hope everyone gets a chance to hear this album, by a very talented man. This music will make you reexamine your life and help you through difficult times, as well as sooth you as you listen to it. Give it a try.

Loaded with the populist and humanist touches that differentiate his brand of modern country from that of the Nashville boy-crooners riding his coat-tails, FRESH HORSEScontinues Garth Brooks' streak of exciting, fresh-faced albums. It's not just that the Oklahoma-born singer has created a platform that offers something for every country music connoisseur--the instrumentation and song structures nod toward the traditional, the booming sound hints at southern fried and arena-rock, the lyrical stance is as progressive as Music City gets--but the fact that Brooks clearly reaches out to each of these constituencies, and is quite natural doing it.Among Garth's contributions to country has been the infusion of that old-time rock and roll spirit to Nashville's age-old conventions. On FRESH HORSES, Brooks once again drinks from that fruitful well with memorable results. &quot;The Old Stuff&quot; is a reminiscence about life on the road &quot;back when the old stuff was new,&quot; and gives guitarists Chris Leuzinger and Gordon Kennedy some space to do a Silver Bullet Band-styled battle with Bobby Wood's keyboard; &quot;The Fever&quot; updates an old Aerosmith thrasher for the rodeo set; and &quot;Rollin',&quot; aportrait of a female trucker's life on the road, is a hard-driving piece of honky-tonk with a vocal that's pure Elvis.That woman behind the wheel brings up another point that separates Brooks and FRESH HORSES from country's other hunk-alikes: the strength of his female characters. The fate-bitten, single mother nurturingly caring for her offspring (&quot;That Ol' Wind&quot;), the wife drifting into the sunset after the sudden demise of her one true love (&quot;The Beaches Of Cheyenne&quot;) and the trucker choosing her ownpath rather than letting her man do it for her (&quot;Rollin'&quot;) leap above easy cliches, and embody the respect Brooks approaches the so-called fairer sex with. This makes him not only a talented country star, but one who's easy to admire.

All That I Can Say is a breath of fresh air in R&amp;B, where lately talent doesn't seem to matter as long as the beat is hot, but Mary proves to everyone that she is the undisputed Queen of R&amp;B/Soul with this song. A collaboration with Lauryn Hill (it was written by her and she sings background vocals), this song is simply beautiful, about the many splendor things you feel when you love someone. Mary HAS talent, unlike many of the current R&amp;B trendsetters, Mary can sing and this song is no exception. She shines on this 70's groove song, it will make you smile. Mary sings about real life, about real things she's experienced, and especially on this song I can feel what shes saying, I feel through her music I can truly understand what shes putting in her music. This single includes the radio edit and album version of All That I Can Say, as well as the radio edit for her hit Beautiful from How Stella Got Her Groove Back. A must have.

It was wise for Madonna to record this song. It was ahead of its time. It's different than her usual material (at that time), and Bjork could not have given Madonna a greater present. While it was not widely accepted by radio, this is Madonna's most creative work. The remixes are great and will keep you dancing (thanks to Junior Vasquez). This single is a must for all Madonna fans, you wont be disapointed.

Maxwell's latest album is called NOW, and it's one of his best. He sure doesn't disapoint folks. NOW has everything you would want, some real funky beats and rhythms that will make you want to head for the dancefloor, the tender beautiful ballads that show true raw emotion from Maxwell, everything you would expect and more. My favorite tracks are &quot;Get To Know Ya&quot; a hot upbeat song with nice fanfare on it, &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; which should be a huge hit, a beautiful tender ballad that will make you melt when you hear it, and other favorites include &quot;Lifetime&quot;, &quot;Temporary Nite&quot;, &quot;Was My Girl&quot; to name a few, but the whole album is excellent. It was well worth the wait!

Set This Circus down is Tim McGraw's sixth studio album, and arguably his best yet. On this new collection of songs, Tim has created one of the best sounding country albums to come out in a while. His ability to choose hit songs is amazing, every song on this album could be released to country radio, and be a success. When he records the albums though he isnt even thinking of what country will play and what they wont, he makes the music he wants to make, which just proves what a great career he has. Tim has proven with this new album that he has longevity in his career. Highlights include the honest The Cowboy In Me, You Get Used To Somebody, the soul bearing Take Me Away From Here, the ballad of a broken marriage Angry All The Time (with Faith Hill on background vocals), and much more. Go out and get a copy, you wont regret it!

TLC always had the attention on them, but this song was one of their biggest hits. Lisa Left Eye Lopez wrote this song after leaving the mental institution where she was working on her problems after she unintentionally burnt down Andre Rison's home. She was a rainbow and came up with the rap. This is a remarkable song, the remixes are nice but nothing touches the original. Go TLC!

On STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS, Tori covers songs, and sings them from a woman's perspective. In each song she plays the role of a different woman, which is why there are all the pictures of the women in the booklet of the CD. Honestly this is one of her best albums yet, as she keeps getting better with each one, it surpassed any expectations I had for the album.The songs that struck me the most were I Don't Like Mondays, 97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde (very haunting), Real Men, Time and I'm Not In Love. Every song is excellent. I worry with cover albums and cover songs that the new versions will try to surpass the originals by changing elements of the song, therefore changing it entirely. After hearing these songs, I wasn't worried. Tori did these songs in her own way, making hers different from the originals, without taking away from the uniqueness of her own song or the original versions.The good thing is with each song she plays a different role. She really gets into those roles. Because each role is different, each song is different too, but they all lead into each other very well. Overall STRANGE LITTLE GIRLS is a winner in my opinion, and a must have for all fans of Tori's music, as well as anyone who might be curious, wanting to join the quirky wacky world of Tori Amos' music.

Veruca Salt has successfully weathered its personnel crises and returns as strong and defiant as ever. Sole remaining founding member Louise Post has started afresh with a new label and a new band to orchestrate her musical vision; the result is RESOLVER.&quot;The Same Person&quot; opens gently with a mantra segueing into &quot;Born Entertainer,&quot; featuring Post's trademark double-octave vocals and a clever Cheap Trick pun. Upbeat vocal harmonies contrast severely with the abrasive lyrics of &quot;Best You Can Get,&quot; while the melancholy power-ballad &quot;All Dressed Up&quot; tells the tale of a woman trying to reinvent herself to please her lover, and finding the cause an empty and unrewarding one. &quot;Used To Know Her&quot; could pass for a lament over the departure of co-founder Nina Gordon. &quot;Yeah Man&quot; contrasts quiet verses with big, vocal harmony-heavy choruses, and &quot;Disconnected&quot; features Louise sounding desperately emotional, with lines such as &quot;it's kind of scary when you're lover leaves you for a lucky star.&quot; While RESOLVER focuses on varying degrees of romantic discontent, Louise Post appears quite comfortable at the helm of a revitalized Veruca Salt. However, the music just doesn't have the same energy as when Nina Gordon headed the group, however its a decent attempt.

Songs From The Last Century is a breath of heaven. George sings these standards so well. His voice is so beautiful, it expresses a lot of emotion. Some highlights include Brother Can You Spare A Dime, Roxanne, Secret Love (the fanfare!) Wild Is the Wind, Miss Sarajevo, but the standout is the classic The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. Breathtaking. This is a must for fans of music, its a collection you will never forget.

Fan Mail was released in February 1999, a long 4 and a half years since 1994's Crazysexycool. This time, they decided to go for a more futuristic sound in R&amp;B, and decided to dedicate this album to their fans, after receiving so much fan mail from them in their long absence. Before this album came out, there were rumors of TLC breaking up, but fear not it wasnt true. They faced a lot in the media, with their bankrupcy and other problems they were facing.The album starts with the title track, Fan Mail, and we are introduced with a new voice, that is Vic E a computer generated voice. The harmonies are still tight as ever, TLC is back. The song even features Left Eye in an interview clippet at the end, where she talks about the fans. There is a Vic E interlude, then the fun song Silly Ho, which shocked a few people because TLC was now using profanity in some forms. Another interlude at the club, and then the very big hit No Scrubs, which is awesome only I complain because this is the version without that Left Eye rap.The album continues with one of the most controversial songs by TLC called Im Good At Being Bad, which is perhaps one of their songs that uses the most profanity. If They Knew is a nice song, with a great rap by Left Eye. With the next track we are introduced to the first ballad, a stunning song called I Miss You So Much, with Chilli on main vocals.Unpretty, the second single follows, which was a huge hit and showed people they should believe in theirselves and not get caught up in how they look or what people say. My Life is a really great song, with an excellent rap by Left Eye. Shout was the fourth single, only in the UK I believe, but its a great song. Come On Down is a Diane Warren penned song, which drips just like honey from your speakers with those beautiful vocals by Chilli.Next is a beautiful song, another ballad, which was the third single, and my favorite song, called Dear Lie. A very personal song, very beautiful. T-Boz shines on this one. Didn't do well on the charts but forever will be one of my favorite TLC songs. Another interlude, then an intersting song called Lovesick which uses a phone as a background to the song. Automatic is a really good song too, with nice harmonies. Don't Pull Out On Me Yet is a nice album closer, some consider it to be the sequel to Red Light Special.Overall this album is something that cant be missed. I for one think the long wait was well worth it, Dallas Austin and LA Reid produced one hell of an album, and it was so nice of TLC to make this album and dedicate it to the fans. A must have!

Kylie's 2000 album LIGHT YEARS was a departure from her badly received but creatively successful 1997 album IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS. This is a genuine throwback to the 70's and the disco era. It opens with the hits &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;On A Night Like This&quot;. The songs on this album will make you want to move and dance and sing along. &quot;So Now Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Disco Down&quot; are adorable songs that should be considered Kylie classics. &quot;Butterfly&quot; was a promo single in the US. The other singles from the album were &quot;Your Disco Needs You&quot;, a campy fun song, and the cash in on the Latin craze at the time titled &quot;Please Stay&quot;, which I cannot stand. It's any wonder why it was a single when there were clearly better choices. Another song that doesn't do it for me is the Robbie Williams duet &quot;Kids&quot;, and &quot;Bittersweet Goodbye&quot;, the albums only ballad, seems out of place. Another great track is the title track. Overall a fun campy album Kylie fans will love, definately a favorite of mine.

A lot of people don't like this album because it's very contemporary, and a departure from his previous albums. I think it's a really interesting album lyrically, and the hooks are nice. &quot;So Alive&quot; is one of the best songs on the album, it has a great hook and the vocals are great too. &quot;Anybody Wanna Take Me Home&quot; is very nice too, should be a single definately. &quot;Do Miss America&quot; is a fun rocker. The album closes with the great song &quot;The Drugs Not Working&quot;. &quot;Shallow&quot; and &quot;This Is It&quot; are pretty good songs that would be good singles as well. &quot;Burning Photographs&quot; is another favorite too. Overall a good collection of music.

Jamie O Neal blew me away with this album. Usually newcomers arent as good and take a few years to find their signature songs, but Jamie has one, the #1 hit There Is No Arizona. What a great song, but not the only one. Her debut album Shiver is filled with great songs. All the songs are worthy to be singles, from the upbeat (When I Think About Angels, No More Portecting My Heart), the ballads (Where We Belong, She Hasn't Heard It Yet, You Rescued Me, Shiver, Im Still Waiting). This is the album to get if you want good music, all the songs are excellent. This woman is going to go far, here's to a bright future for this talented woman!

Jamie O Neal's debut album SHIVER is one of the best country albums I bought last year, and I still listen to it all the time. She has a beautiful voice and there is not one filler track to be found on here. I really like She Hasn't Heard It Yet, You Rescued Me, I'm Still Waiting, Sanctuary and To Be With You the most, but they are all great songs. If you liked There Is No Arizona or When I Think About Angels, you will love this cd! It's excellent and I will enjoy watching this talented singer's star rise into country superstardom.

Who I Am is a refreshing album to hear, in a world of country music where so much sounds alike, its refreshing to hear an album like this that stands on its own distinctively and warms your heart. Jessica Andrews blew everyone away in 1998 when she sang I Will Be There For You for The Prince of Egypt soundtrack, and her amazing debut album Heart Shaped World became a popular album. Who I Am is a great album as well, maybe even better than Heart Shaped World. She shows strength in her voice, as well as her ability to choose songs that really suit her. The songs are sung with such emotion and heartfelt tenderness, Jessica makes you feel like you are a close friend or something to that respect. Highlights include the title track hit Who I Am, Karma, Now I Know, Every Time and I Dont Like Anyone, although many would agree with me, all tracks are spectacular and its hard to choose the worst song (because there probably is none) while its also hard to choose the best one. Great job Jessica!

Come On Over was a good album, but its pale in comparison to this fantastic album, The Woman In Me. This created a tidal wave of change in country. Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under and Any Man Of Mine changed country, because it was a female who was dressing a little more skimpier and was a little more sassy that what country was used to. Those were the two first hits, but then came another gem, my personal favorite, The Woman In Me (Needs the Man In You). Beautiful song. If Youre Not In It For Love is fun. You Win My Love is the best upbeat in my opinion. I could go on and on. Another good one is Home Aint Where His Heart Is Anymore. Other memorable songs are God Bless The Child (video is much better), Leavin is The Only Way Out, If It Dont Take Two and more. You need this album if you like country, it was revolutionary.

This album is wonderful in my opinion, it contains some of my favorite Melissa Etheridge songs. Its a very hard edged album, not to say there are not some nice &quot;ballads&quot;, but its a really high energy album. My two favorite songs Your Little Secret and I Want To Come Over, both excellent rock songs. Nowhere To Go is a great song as well. There are some other great rock songs such as I Really Like You and An Unusual Kiss, I Could've Been You. There are also some beautiful songs such as All The Way To Heaven, Shriner's Park, Change and This War Is Over. Melissa is a very talented artist, this album being one of many reasons why. Give it a shot!

On Mary's newest album LOVE AND LIFE, she teamed up with Sean Combs who helped make her first two albums a success. Obviously, the public is not responding well to this reconciliation, because the album is not doing too well. The album has already had three singles and has not even been out yet for 6 months. The latest single, &quot;Not Today&quot;, featuring Eve, is so far the most successful. &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; and &quot;Oooh&quot; flopped big time. The music on the album is not bad, but overproduced. Some of the sampling works in favor of the songs, but other times it just works against it. I hope Mary finds herself on her next album, because this and NO MORE DRAMA were very weak compared to albums like MARY, MY LIFE or SHARE MY WORLD. Highlights from this include &quot;When We&quot;, &quot;Oooh&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Willing and Waiting&quot;, and a few others, but there's too many songs here that sound the same, and ultimately it's a pretty forgettable album.

Next is an amazing album by an amazing artist, Vanessa Williams has to be one of the most underrated artists. She has created some of the most memorable music, and she continues to with her latest album Next. This is a more adult contemporary, jazzy type album, and its so beautiful. Vanessa has a beautiful, smooth voice that just soars on songs like these. Key tracks include: And My Heart Goes, Crazy Bout You, Lose WIthout You, The Easiest Thing and And If I Ever. Give this a try its a cd filled with some really great music that you will love.

I just bought he International Version of Come On Over. Many of the singles we've heard on pop radio with these remixes. They are well done and lend well to pop. In some cases the mixes are even better then the original country ones.Some highlights include You're Still The One, You've Got A Way, Love Gets Me Every Time, If You Wanna Touch Her Ask, etc etc.Oh by the way to the reviewer who defended Shania by comparing her to Dolly. Dont even bother. The reason Dolly was successful in pop crossover is because in whatever she crossed over to, it still had its country roots, and they didnt remix the song for pop, it just stayed the same version on all formats. Shania is great, but she releases different versions to different formats.

Brian McKnight's smooth vocals, melodickeyboard-based tunes and honest lyrics help define a style of R&amp;B that has been scarce in the '90s. On his third set, McKnight continues to touch the heart with his soulful grooves and heartfelt ballads. Although a guest appearance from Mase on &quot;You Should Be Mine (Don't Waste Your Time)&quot; makes for a great pop hit, McKnight's true musical talent and vocal ability replace R&amp;B's usual connection with hip-hop on ANYTIME. Songs like &quot;Could&quot; and &quot;Anytime&quot; use the slow love song formula while &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;You Got The Bomb&quot; remind listeners what smooth up-tempo R&amp;B should sound like.

Join the fever! Kylie's newest album FEVER is one of the catchiest albums I've heard in a long while! It's a combination of 80s pop mixed with techno and other genres, which creates and irresistible mix of pop and dance, and will make you want to head out on the dancefloor. FEVER is the album which brought Kylie back to the US, after 14 years, with the worldwide smash Cant Get You Out Of My Head. However, that is just the beginning of the best. More More More, Love At First Sight, Give It To me, Burning Up and Fever are all great songs. Overall its a great fun album to listen to, so go out and get it, and get ready to party!

J.Lo is a departure of sorts from her debut album On the 6. On this album, the songs are more upbeat, showcasing a more confident Jennifer. Its a very latin flavored album, the tracks will keep you dancing and burning up that dancefloor. Its safe to say most of the 15 tracks on this cd are upbeat dance numbers, and there are the sensual ballads as well. I predict the singles from this album will include Im Real, Play, Dance With Me, We Gotta Talk or That's Not Me (not all of them but some of those are likely to become singles). I suggest this album to anyone who wants to smile, because the album is happy and will keep you dancing through the day.

The Concert was one of the greatest concerts in musical history. This collection was released, a 2 CD set, of her concert at Madison Square Garden in 1994. Her first concert in almost 20 years or so, Barbra put on a show that will forever be remembered. There is also a video, which is also worth checking out.Barbra sings old favorites people have grown to love in the course of her magnificent 30 year + career. Somewhere, As If We Never Said Goodbye, Not While Im Around, For All We Know, The Way We Were, Evergreen, On A Clear Day (You Can See Forever), a Yentl Medly, Disney Medley and so much more. Barbra also takes the time to talk to the crowd, making this collection very accessable and inviting to the listener.This is in a way a career retrospective of Barbra's and a reminder that she may not tour or do concerts often, but when she does, she never disapoints. Do yourself a favor and get this collection, you will not regret this purchase.

This is an outstanding album. Released in November 1997, it was a project Barbra had been working on for many many years. It is a touching collection of inspirational songs. Barbra has never sounded so beautiful. These songs were meant for Barbra to sing, or so she proves by singing them. Her angelic voice powerfully sings the songs, that all have beautiful messages.1. I Believe/You'll Never Walk AloneA great song to kick off the cd. A touching song, very inspiring and uplifting for the soul.2. Higher GroundThis is the title track, a very powerful song that you will love. Its very uplifiting and honest, in a belief about a higher power.3. At The Same TimeThis is a beautiful song that demonstrates how as people we are interconnected and are responsible for one another, and how we are all living together in the world, our hearts beating as one, at the same time.4. Tell Him (With Celine Dion)This is a great duet, it was about time the two collaborated. A song about a younger, less experienced woman, asking for help with her relationship, then the wiser more experienced woman giving her advice. Beautiful song.5. On Holy GroundA beautiful song that explains how we should celebrate and be thankful we are walking on Holy Ground.6. If I CouldThis song was done for her son Jason, it is a very touching song.7. CircleThis song is simply how life is a circle, and the power of love and faith.8. The Water Is Wide/Deep RiverAnother inspiring song about faith, and the connection between deep water and crossing over.9. Leading With Your HeartThis is a beautiful song that Marvin Hamlisch and ALan &amp; Marilyn Bergman wrote for Barbra, knowing how much she loved Virginia Kelley, titled after her autobiography by the same name. Very touching song.10. Lessons To Be LearnedThis is a beautiful, touching, uplifting song that explains how in life there are no mistakes, but lessons to be learned. It explores questioning our faith, when things happen that we do not understand.11. Everything Must ChangeThis is a beautiful song about accepting change, as we grow older as people, and learning to embrace it and celebrate life.12. Avinu MalkeinuA song in request to ask God to treat us equally and fairly, even if we haven't lived up to his teachings.This collection of music will soothe your soul, it will uplift your spirit, it will make you think about life, and why we are here, things like that. I am not a part of organized religion, but I do believe in higher powers and faith from within, and this collection of music will inspire you to believe in a beautiful life that is out there waiting for you. A must have collection.

Welcome to Maxwell's, where the groove always flows and love fuels all. Eschewing the slicker tendencies of contemporary R&amp;B, Maxwell joins young turks D'Angelo and Tony Rich in looking back to the aesthetics of '70s soul for inspiration. Opening and closing with instrumentals (&quot;The Urban Theme&quot; and &quot;The Suite Theme&quot;), URBAN HANG SUITE is knee-deep in wah-wah guitar, funky Rhodes piano and lush, atmospheric sounds that evoke silk sheets and champagne.Although Al Green and Marvin Gaye are obvious touchstones, Maxwell avoids vocal theft, instead appropriating the way those singers inextricably meld their music and their sensuality. The breathy quiet-storm sax that closes out &quot;Welcome&quot; is as much a part of the sexual vibe as the sinewy funk and propulsive rhythm of &quot;Ascension(Don't Ever Wonder).&quot; Oozing with sensuality, URBAN SUITE is a soundtrack for an evening of romance.

Daydream was a breakthrough in many ways. It changed music. It spun off three #1 hits and sold millions worldwide, proving to be one of Mariah's most successful albums to date. Fantasy is just one of those songs you just have to sing along with whenever you hear it, same thing with Always Be My Baby. These are classic R&amp;B songs that only Mariah can deliver. Other mentionable songs on here include the dreamy ballads Underneath The Stars, When I Saw You, Forever, the anthems I Am Free, One Sweet Day (with Boyz II Men) and Looking In, the midtempo Melt Away and more. This is a must have for any music lover.

Control was Janet's breakthrough, after two promising albums with disapointing sales, Control was released. The songs were different from what was out there, they were brutal in their honesty. It was different, and the public embraced it. Control is a declaration of independance, this is felt throughout the album. Every song on here is the best, and the videos just make the songs come alive with her awesome dancing and storylines. Everyone must get this revolutionary album, you wont regret it.

Rhythm Nation 1814 was one of Janet's greatest works ever. With every album she takes on new issues, but it was this album that created awareness and helped her acheive greater success. 7 of the 8 singles (yes State of the World was a single for a breif period and in the top 10) went into the top 5, many of which hit #1. The album tackles world problems, such as racism (Rhythm Nation, State of the World), hate issues spread to children (Livin in a World, and many many other issues. Its not just a serious album, it is done in a great way with songs that make you want to dance all night. This album changed the way the music was at that time. There's fun songs about love (Miss You Much, Love Will Never Do, Alright) and lush ballads about being lonely and missing someone (Come Back To Me, Lonely). The standout is the hard rockin song Black Cat. This is a must for fans of music, this album changed the views on society as well as the world of music. Congrats to Janet, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis for creating one of the best albums ever.

The new album by Alison Krauss and Union Station is a treat, it is simply wonderful to listen to. The album lends its influences from the OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU soundtrack, in songs like &quot;The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn&quot;, &quot;Choctaw Hayride&quot;, &quot;Momma Cried&quot;, &quot;Bright Sunny South&quot;, &quot;It All Comes Down To You&quot;, and &quot;Take Me For Longing&quot; to name a few. Not only Alison on lead vocals, but fellow band mate Dan takes his turns on many tracks, adding his beautiful bluegrass style to the mix. Plus there are the classic songs fans have grown to love, reminiscent of her FORGET ABOUT IT album such as &quot;New Favorite&quot;, &quot;Let Me Touch You For Awhile&quot;, &quot;The Lucky One&quot;, to name a few. This is the perfect album for fans of Krauss and Union Station, as well as fans of bluegrass. If you haven't listened to it, see what the fuss is about, this is some great music.

This is Wy's first studio album since 1997's THE OTHER SIDE. On this album, the production is a little smoother and the vocals are even stronger. It's a little more laid back, but there are still the signature rockin songs, the tender ballads, the dreamy upbeat songs, everything you would expect from a Wynonna Judd album. The album starts off on with &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;, in my opinion one of the best tracks, a shame that country radio didn't play it more. Hell its a shame country radio practically ignores Wynonna in favor of the pop-country singers. &quot;Can't Nobody Love You (Like I Do) is classic Wynonna ballad sytle. She does a wonderful cover of the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Help Me&quot;, very dreamy and floaty in a sense. Wynonna rocks it blues style on songs like &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, &quot;He Rocks&quot; and &quot;Tuff Enuff&quot;. She shows the sensitive side on other ballads like &quot;Who Am I Trying To Fool&quot; and &quot;Learning To Live With Love Again&quot;. The second disc is a reunion EP for the Judds, where Wynonna is reunited with her mother Naomi, and there are four tracks. The standout is &quot;The 90's Was The 60's Turned Upside Down&quot; which critisized the 90's for being too torpescent about important issues in that era. Its great to hear Naomi and Wy singing together again! But overall, Wynonna doesn't disapoint with this album. It pleases the masses, with something to offer for every fan. It's great to hear her singing again, because she's never sounded better.

Sheryl Crow's GLOBE SESSIONS is her artistic triumph in my opinion. While many fans abandoned her after this album, because it is significantly more depressing and dark than her previous albums, it is perhaps her greatest artistic acheivement. The songs all have this unifying sentiment among them, this is a deeply personal album. From the triumph in &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot;, which is a cool type of regret, to the firey burn out anger in &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;, Sheryl covers all bases and lets her fans into her own world. &quot;Anything But Down&quot; is an anthem of sorts, where she realizes the person only brings her down and makes her feel worthless, a nice song but most likely the weakest song here. &quot;Members Only&quot; is an excellent song, perfect social commentary on the world today. The ballad &quot;The Difficult Kind&quot; is so emotionally raw and painful, its like as a listener you are listening to her problems as she pours out her soul with no holds barred. The song &quot;Riverwide&quot; is beautifully poignant, in fact the album was slated to be titled &quot;Riverwide&quot;. Other highlights include &quot;Am I Getting Through&quot;, &quot;Maybe That's Something&quot;, and the Bob Dylan penned &quot;Mississippi&quot;. This is her triumph, I highly reccomend this album!

This is a wonderful CD to have if you are a fan of the Dixie Chicks. They have a wonderful energy on stage, which translates well onto this live CD. A lot of people say the arrangements are the same and it sounds just the same as their studio albums, but I disagree. There's a passion and emotion here not found on their albums, something different. They sing all their hits. Highlights include &quot;A Home&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;There's Your Trouble&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, and many more. It would have been nice to hear hits like &quot;I Can Love You Better&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;You Were Mine&quot;, but this is still a great collection to own.

Whitney's first album in 8 years. Wow, first one since Im Your Baby Tonight (1990). After a slew of successful movies she returns to the recording studio for a full album, this one called My Love Is Your Love. With a slew of guest artists and producers, this is one of her best albums yet. The album spinned off many hits such as Its Not Right But Its Okay (the remix is better), Heartbreak Hotel with Kelly Price &amp; Faith Evans (a very soulful R&amp;B song, youll love it), My Love Is Your Love (with Wyclef, a very touching song I love it), When You Believe (with Mariah Carey, its a really good song and they both sing so well, should of done way better than it got credit for), I Learned From The Best (one of three tracks penned by Diane Warren, produced by David Foster). However there is so much more on this album. Missy Elliot lends her talent to the hip hop song In My Business, If I Told You That is a funky R&amp;B tune which was later rerecorded for her Greatest Hits album this time with George Michael lending vocals, but this is just as good. Oh Yes tends to be a little over polished but still nice. Get It Back is a really funky R&amp;B tune youll love dancing to, Until You Come Back is the power ballad of the cd youll love, I Bow Out is another fun song as well. The album closes with two last tracks, the wonderful Youll Never Stand Alone which is almost the predeccor of You Were Loved, and the album closes with a R&amp;B song with Lauryn Hill called I Was Made To Love Him. This is a really good album with some good music, youll like it just give it a listen.

GIVE ME SOME WHEELS is Suzy's overall most consistent album to date, which was overlooked yet again by country radio. WHEELS features some of Suzy's best uptempo songs ever, as well as some compelling ballads which she is just so good at. Suzy's voice is so fresh and clear and beautiful, its a shame country wont listen to her unique storytelling and voice. &quot;Fall&quot; is a declaration of taking the plunge to fall in love. &quot;Traveling Light&quot; is one of the catchiest songs here, a song about leaving, with an upbeat message about leaving the past behind and finding happiness. &quot;No Way Out&quot; is a quirky little ditty with hints of R&amp;B in it. The ballad &quot;Saying Goodbye To A Friend&quot; is so tragically beautiful, sung with so much emotion and pain, it just resonates with you. The title track is another winner, very catchy. Overall WHEELS is a must have cd, and a reminder of what country used to be like in 1996, dont miss out on this.

A quick glance at the songwriting credits on SEVENS might give you the idea that Brooks, the quintessential proletariat hero, the Springsteen of Nashville, has gone hip on his blue-collared, regular-Joe listeners. &quot;You Move Me&quot; was co-authored by thinking mans's singer-songwriter Pierce Pettis and &quot;Bellau Wood&quot; is a collaboration between Brooks and underground country-rock hero Joe Henry. Fear not, though, because while he's looking outside the usual circle of Nashville writers for material, SEVENS is classic Garth Brooks.There are downtempo heart-breakers like &quot;I Don't Have To Wonder&quot; and boisterous sing-along numbers such as the Jimmy Buffett-esque &quot;Two Pina Coladas.&quot; Garth ups the hormone quotient on the lusty &quot;Take The Keys To My Heart&quot; and adds a touch of bluegrass to &quot;Do What You Gotta Do.&quot; A career like his is based on a lot more than good fortune, but SEVENS is sure to be a lucky number, both for Brooks and his legions of fans.

Sara Evans sophomore disc is a treat. Her first album didn't fare well, it was a little to traditional for country radio and they ultimately discarded it. This album gave her a little success, with a bit of traditional country but leaning a little more to the contemporary side, pushing her vocals. Everybody knows the title track, it was the hit single of the album, and I believe an award winning duet with Vince Gill. It's defintely a memorable song. The album opens with &quot;The Great Unknown&quot;, a song about picking up and leaving to go anywhere with someone. &quot;Cryin Game&quot; was a single, it's a fun uptempo song. &quot;Fool I'm A Woman&quot; was another single. I really like the ballad &quot;I Never Thought I'd See Your Face Again&quot;, which would have worked as a single. Alison Krauss joins her on &quot;These Days&quot;. It's a great CD overall.

Danni Leigh's debut album 29 Nights is a true treat for the true country fan. She is described as the female Dwight Yoakam. Her debut album, 29 Nights, gives a glimpse of Leigh's vocal talent, while re-emphasizing her ability to pen a song about real feelings and intimate struggles. This album is just one example of Leigh's ability as a vocalist to inject just enough feeling and heart without overpowering the beautifully simplistic message of her song. As a sample of what Danni Leigh has to offer, here is a cd that won't disappoint, no matter what your mood. My favorite songs on here include the ballad 29 Nights, and the closing track Weren't You The One, although all the tracks are excellent. This is worth a listen, and its truly sad that country radio will not play this very talented young lady.

On his sixth album, IN PIECES, THE superstar of country music is poised once again to break all sales records. Culling from the style of his idol Billy Joel as much as any country influence, Brooks delves further into the mix of high drama and low places of country pop. Country pedigree aside, Brooks is the quintessential pop star.IN PIECES refers to the random way Brooks collected the songs for the album, but the album is in no way a misguided effort. It is a seamless collection. Most artists are lucky if there is one blockbuster on an album; IN PIECES has several: &quot;The Night I Called The Old Man Out,&quot; &quot;Standing Outside The Fire,&quot; and the 4 1/2 minute epic &quot;Ain't Goin' Down ('Til The Sun Comes Up).&quot; The bluesy &quot;Kickin' And Screamin'&quot; is a left-of-center departure, a la Lyle Lovett. &quot;The Red Strokes&quot; effectively utilizes art as metaphor for romance and serves as one of Brooks' best recordings in a discography including numerous gems. He displays his talent for singing, not posturing or grandstanding.Garth switches to Cajun spice for &quot;Callin' Baton Rouge&quot; and returns to his roots and spurs for &quot;The Cowboy Song.&quot; A murder witnessed by illicit lovers sparks the percussion-heavy &quot;Night Will Only Know.&quot; On several songs, Brooks is joined by Trisha Yearwood's harmonies.With all the pieces added together Garth has, once again, created an album of substance.

I remember the very day I got this album, it was the day it was released, November 11th 1997, I begged my parents to buy it for me. I wasn't dissapointed. This still remains one of my favorite country albums. Ten Thousand Angels was a good cd, but this outshined it by far.The album however, was not well received because of some poor marketing strategies, and not enough support behind it. This could be why there were problems between Mindy and BNA to begin with. What If I Do was the lead single on the album, a song which reflects the confusion and aftermath of what happens if you give in to a man, or if you dont. The song didn't do too well, if I recall it only made it to #27 or so on the country charts. This Is Me is a great song that should of been a single. If I Don't Stay The Night would of been a nice single, with a classic looking video. Cross Against The Moon is a very nice ballad. For A Good Time Call is a nice song which is lots of fun, and Oh Romeo is a good song, although sometimes it lacks somewhat. The Other Side Of This Kiss was the third and final single from this album, a nice fun country song that will keep you singing along and dancing. You'll Never Know was the second single and proved to be the most successful single of the album, hitting the top 10, which was accompanied by a lovely video taped in Aspen Colorado. Fine Art of Holding A Woman is a beautiful ballad. Only A Whisper is probably my least favorite on here, but it can be a nice song sometimes. The album ends with a lovely rendition of Long Long Time, by Linda Ronstandt originally. This is one album worth checking out. The cd is also one of the first country cds to become and Enhanced CD, which means you can pop it into your computer and it will load a nice interactive section with stuff about mindy and her music. This is one album you must get!

Runaway was (and still is) a refreshing song. The lead single from her greatest hits album Design of a Decade 1986/1996 which has two new songs and 14 hits. The remixes on this single are fab. My favorite is the unplugged mix of Runaway, but the When I Think Of You remixes are great as well. A must have for fans!

This CD got lukewarm reception from critics and fans alike, but its great for many reasons. SECRET LOVE is a collection of standards, it is by no means a country album. Now you may wonder if Lorrie can pull of standards, and the answer is a resounding yes. She handles the classics very well without overpowering them or diminishing their value, her voice is both strong enough and restrained when it needs to be in the songs. The CD gives me a nostalgic feeling, thinking about broadway musicals. Lorrie transcendes through each song with ease and flow, giving us a seamless set of songs for the times. It includes some classics such as An Affair To Remember, Here's That Rainy Day, Once Upon A Time, Secret Love, Summer of '42, Fly Me To The Moon, They Cant Take That Away From Me and many more. Overall its a great album, if you enjoy the genre of music then its definately for you. Lorrie fans beware this is not her typical country album, so caution to you if you dont enjoy her other expenditures. Overall a treat!

Tank's Force of Nature is a great cd. He has a very distinct and beautiful voice, that expresses many emotions and reaches out to the listeners and grabs their attention. There is a lot of male R&amp;B singers out there, but Tank stands on his own as an individual. Maybe I Deserve is one of the most compelling songs I've heard this year in R&amp;B, really great song. This album is perfect for any mood, whether you want to party, relax, or just have some quiet time, this is the cd you want. You wont regret this purchase!

Linda Davis has one of the most beautiful voices in country music. She started making it big by performing on tour with Reba, as her background singer. Some Things Are Meant To Be is a great album filled with some great material. The title track is a beautiful love song that a lot of romantics will love. Love Story In The Making is a great love song as well. Always Will is a bluesy type song that could of been a hit if released. The surprise is the duet with Reba McEntire, titled If I Could Live Your Life. This is an underrated singer who deserves a listen, give her a try you will fall in love with Linda Davis' music. I also suggest you try her Im Yours album.

Dannii Minogue is often left in the shadows behind her sister, Kylie. But this collection offers fans some delicious remixes, for songs such as Success, This Is The Way, Baby Love, I Don't Wanna Take This Pain, Love And Kisses, Jump To The Beat, This Is It, Get Into You, All I wanna Do, Show You The Way, Everything I wanted, Disrememberance, and Hallucination. Overall nice remixes, but only for the hardcore fan.

Turn off the lights, have a glass of wine, and listen to this album. This is brilliant stuff. This was meant to be the official follow up to his 2001 album GOLD, but Lost Highway shelved the album and asked him to record something more mainstream, which he did with ROCK N ROLL (which is good in its own right, but it can't compare to this or his other work). So ROCK N ROLL was released as the official follow up, and the LOVE IS HELL sessions were released as two EPs (although now I've heard that Lost Highway is going to release it as one disc, why they didn't do this initially remains to be seen). Part One of LOVE IS HELL is really good, even better than Part Two if you ask me. It opens with the piano ballad &quot;Political Scientist&quot;, moving into the dark ballad &quot;Afraid Not Scared&quot;. The tempo is kicked up a little on &quot;This House Is Not For Sale&quot; and the title track, which are both great songs. He does a really great cover of Oasis' &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, with haunting vocals and arrangements. The last three songs, &quot;The Shadowlands&quot;, &quot;World War 24&quot; and &quot;Avalanche&quot; are brilliant songs, that should not be missed. This is essential Ryan Adams to own, and should not be missed. Among some of the best work he's ever done in his career.

It's about time that Sheryl Crow is honored with a Greatest Hits album. Each of her four albums are impressive, and on their own brilliant, but it's nice to have some sort of collection. It's not essential if you own the other albums though, all you get are two new songs. Not to say they are bad songs. Not at all. Her cover of Cat Stevens &quot;First Cut Is The Deepest&quot; is excellent and she does it well. Sheryl Crow understands real rock n roll and how it works. She doesn't try to change the wheel. She sticks with what works, which is why she is successful in my opinion. She's just awesome all around. This is a worthwhile collection, for the new songs, but it's not a perfect collection. A lot of songs are missing such as &quot;Anything But Down&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child of Mine&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, etc. They would have worked better than songs here like &quot;There Goes The Neighborhood&quot;, which was not a huge hit or aynthing. Either way, solid collection from an extremely talented artist.

The Immaculate Collection is a collection of many of Madonna's hits from the 80's. The collection is a great retrospective to the 80s because she was such a vital part to the 80s and to the direction music took as a result of her music. In 1982 she debuted with Burning Up (which is not on this collection). Her straightforwardness shocked people, and her image made her different and made people think. This album is a chronology of this time period.It contains 17 tracks, 15 hits, and 2 new songs. The songs include Holiday, Lucky Star, Borderline (all from the first album), Like A Virgin, Material Girl (From Like A Virgin album), Crazy For You (from the Vision Quest soundtrack), Into the Groove. As well True Blue hits such as Live To Tell, Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart, La Isla Bonita. Like A Prayer hits such as the title track, Express Yourself, Cherish. And from Im Breathless the song Vogue.The two new tracks are simply wonderful. Justify My Love was a song written by Lenny Kravitz. The video was banned from music stations for its content, but this is one of her best songs. The other new track Rescue Me is another winner too.Madonna has made a huge impact on music, and remains to this day to continue to do that. She may be shocking, but she makes us think, she teaches us, opens our minds. THis album is a must for lovers of her music, or anyone who appreciates good music

The Trouble With The Truth is an excellent album by one of country music's finest female vocalists, Patty Loveless. This is a fine acheivement in her career. The songs are real, sung with such emotion and conviction that any listener could find comfort in its nest of songs, with Patty's beautiful one of a kind voice singing these wonderful songs. The album shows such brutal honesty on songs like The Trouble With The Truth, To Feel That Way At All and Someday I Will Lead The Parade. There are also songs that listeners can find strength in, after leaving a relationship, such as Tear Stained Letter, You Can Feel Bad and She Drew A Broken Heart. There are the beautiful ballads like Lonely Too Long, A Thousand Times A Day and I Miss Who I was (With You). Overall this album satisfies any mood for the listener, making it very accesable and enjoyable. Go out and get it!

Vanessa Williams' sophomore effort THE COMFORT ZONE is classic 90s R&amp;B, at its best. Of course everyone knows the breakout ballad single &quot;Save The Best For Last&quot;, a signature ballad which Vanessa sings beautifully. One would think the album would sound a lot like this, and yes, there's other great ballads, but a majority of the songs will make you want to get on your feet and dance along with the music. Other notable ballads include &quot;Just For Tonight&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; which she shines on vocally yet again. Her rendition of &quot;What Will I Tell My Heart&quot; is showstopping, great vocals, very strong. She has the voice for broadway. Now onto the uptempos. The album opens with the title track which sets a good pace for the album. &quot;Running Back To You&quot; and &quot;Work To Do&quot; are the albums best uptempos. The album has that funky R&amp;B vibe of the early 90s and this is definately an album to get if you're a fan of that era of music. Too bad Vanessa isn't doing any music now, it's a shame, she has so much talent, and she overcame so much. But she found more success in movies and broadway, which is part of what she is doing today. A great album.

Brandy is back with a new album, called FULL MOON. I have to say, as much as I want to like this album, I can't. The album is overproduced with garbled and mixed up songs in terms of production, thanks to Rodney Jerkins, who hasn't produced a good song since 1999. This leads many of the songs to sound the exact same. Take &quot;I Thought&quot;, &quot;What About Us&quot;, &quot;All In Me&quot; and many others and you have the exact same songs with different lyrics. There are too many songs, 17 songs and you feel bored at the end, especially since this album has no consistency whatsoever. It puts all the ballads with a few exceptions at the end of the disc, and during the middle you will feel lost with songs that sound like they are the exact same. Overall its very disapointing and if I had to pick one jewel in this crown, I would say the ballad &quot;Come A Little Closer&quot;, which is a wonderful song. Overall be careful when purchasing this one.

D'Angelo has a winner on his hands, with one of the best albums from 2000, his sophmore album Voodoo. The album is very eclectic and very textured in its sounds, and his calm soothing voice is strong and beautiful. The album is very urban sounding, but one would classify this under Urban, Soul, R&amp;B and hip hop as it lends itself to many music genres. Key tracks include: Playa Playa, Send It On, Chiken Grease, Untitled and Africa. You must get this album it is amazing and there is nothing like it out there.

Butterfly is Mariah Carey's best album in my opinion. She tells enchanting stories in songs (Fourth of July, The Roof). She has lived through the things that are in the songs; letting go (Butterfly); revisiting old memories (Fourth of July, The Roof); losing someone's love (Breakdown); reliving childhood fears (Close My Eyes); acceptance (Outside); and more.Butterfly is a R&amp;B type album that consists mostly of ballads, but has come great upbeat songs, such as the lead off #1 hit Honey, also Breakdown (with Bone Thugs N Harmony) and Babydoll. This is not a bad thing, that it consists mostly of ballads. They are sung from the heart, and with so much emotion you can hear the pain in her voice. The best song on the album is the title track, Butterfly. This is probably one of the best songs she's ever written, and ever recorded. The video is beautiful too. This whole album is well written, and I think many people could relate to it. I think everyone should give this album a listen.

I know what a lot of the critics must be thinking: &quot;Yeah, it's another Mariah CD. Let's go ahead and give it a three. You KNOW what it's gonna sound like.&quot; Well, I TOTALLY disagree with them. This album penetrates the body, strengthens the mind, and accentuates the human spirit. Never have I or will I hear such emotion and coloratura all within a 60-minute timeframe. From the the get up and dance &quot;Honey&quot;, to the highly reminiscient &quot;Fourth of July&quot;, all the way to the cover of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones,&quot; and the powerful identity ballad. The lyrics alone on this album make you just wanna get up and create one of your own CDs (which is what I'm working on). Maybe I'm partial to it because I have not only been a fan for over ten years, but because I can relate to about 90% of what Mariah wrote. Don't get me wrong, I like RAINBOW, too, but if you're looking to find Mariah's most personal, intimate, and simply put-&quot;classic&quot; album, then THIS IS THE ONE

I recently bought Blood on the Dancefloor. I had borrowed it a few months ago from a friend, to tell the truth I didn't like it that much. But I listened to it again a few more times after that, it grew on me. Now I think it is a listenable album.The first five songs are new songs on the collection, the other 8 are remixes of songs from his 1995 album HIStory, the second cd.The first 5 songs include Blood On The Dancefloor, a nice pop song with nice beats and grooves. Morphine is a great song, very dark but the beats are nothing we've heard since his Dangerous album. Superfly Sister is a great song too, sounds like its from the 80s. Ghosts is another great song. Is It Scary is a nice song too.The remixes, some are good, some arent. This is why I only gave the album 4 stars. Some of the better remixes include Stranger In Moscow (Tee's In House Club Mix), Earth Song (Hani's Club Experience), HIStory (TOny Moran's HIStory Lesson), Money (Fire Island Radio Edit), Scream (Flyte Tyme Remix) and a few others, though some I cant listen to because they just dont grab me.If your considering this album, you might want to take a listen before you buy, because its a little of a departure of what hes done before. But if your a hardcore MJ fan you will most likely like it.

Patty Loveless' Long Stretch of Lonesome is one of the best albums to come out of Nashville in a while. So many different emotions and feelings are represented in this fine collection of country music. It is a classic Patty Loveless album, and will forever stand the test of time.The Party Ain't Over Yet is somewhat of a woman's anthem, where she proclaims how she can handle anything that is dished out to her. To Have You Back Again is a song about longing to be with that one that got away. I Don't Want To Feel Like That is an emotional ballad about never wanting to feel sad, or hurt. High On Love is a fun song about the many joys and emotions felt when falling in love. Like Water Into Wine is a very poignant, beautiful love song. That's Exactly What I Mean is a song where both involved in a relationship try to work things out. You Don't Seem To Miss Me is a song in reflection on feeling unloved by someone, George Jones lends vocals to this wonderful song. Too Many Memories is perhaps my favorite, a beautiful, yet sad song about growing old and all those memories you take with you. Long Stretch Of Lonesome is a very beautiful, poignant song that portrays the reality of loneliness, finding that sweet end of the tunnel. Where Im Bound is a song about sweet release, finding one's place in the world.I believe this album is essential to have. Its perfect mood music, no matter which mood. Patty invites you into her heart and lets you hear tales of happinees, sadness and more. Perfect album to listen to when you feel down, she will lighten your spirits.

Some might question why Deana might have a Greatest Hits out since she only had two albums of original material (not counting her Christmas album). This is Capitol's idea though, to cash in on her success. But it's not a total loss, you get all her hits plus 3 rare songs that appeared on the UK pressings of her debut album. Those songs include &quot;Angel Without A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Rita Valentine&quot; and &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot;. You also get her big hits like &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot;, &quot;We Danced Anyway&quot;, &quot;How Do I Get There&quot; and more. Overall a good collection for the new fans, or even the old ones.

When Alison Krauss releases a CD, its an event in itself. This is not just a CD, its a listening experience and journey in itself. Alison has one the most beautiful voice, so clear and full of emotion. Forget About It is the name of the album, and it has some truly compelling tracks that everyone will love. She is one of the reigning queens in bluegrass. 'It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference' is such a beautiful song, very sorrowful but beautiful at the same time. 'Ghost In This House', 'Empty Hearts' and 'Dreaming My Dreams WIth You' are truly poignant songs that speak to the heart, like many of the songs on this album. If you want an excellent album which takes you on a journey through one of the most gratifying listening experiences you'll ever have, this is the cd you want. You will see what the buzz is about, and why Alison Krauss is one of the best in bluegrass.

To Get To You: Greatest Hits Collection is another Greatest Hits Collection for Lorrie Morgan, with 12 hits and 5 new songs. The 5 new songs are fantastic, and will leave you begging for a new album from Lorrie. &quot;To Get To You&quot; is a beautiful power ballad, where you can feel the emotion and passion that Lorrie puts into every note. Definately my favorite of the new songs.Lorrie does a remake of &quot;Another Lonely Song&quot; which shows off Lorrie's traditional country voice, a tribute to Tammy Wynette, as only Lorrie could cover a song by the late country diva. &quot;If I Cry&quot; is another emotional ballad that will leave you breathless, she sings with so much passion and emotion. &quot;Whoop-De-Do&quot; is an upbeat song, a bit of a departure from her usual music, but its fun and you can tell she enjoyed doing it. &quot;Angel&quot; is Lorrie's cover of the Sarah McLaughlin hit, she does it just as well, this one is a live track that will make you want to cry.The hits on this album are We Both Walk, Half Enough, By My Side (with Jon Randall), Good As I Was To You, Go Away, One Of Those Nights Tonight, Maybe Not Tonight (with Sammy Kershaw), I Guess I Had to Be There, Trainwreck of Emotion, Standing Tall, He Talks to Me and the classic Something in Red. It doesnt cover all of her hits, but maybe there will be a Volume II where she can add all those missing ones. Great job Lorrie, country radio may not play your music, but your fans do love you so much and we appreciate your hard work!

CrazySexyCool was one of the best R&amp;B albums of the 90's. The CD showcases Tionne, Lisa and Rozonda's ability to grow together as a group, and their superb harmonies. Every song is a hit. Creep, Waterfalls, Red Light Special and Diggin on You are the big hits on the album but there are plenty others. There's some original R&amp;B grooves here and nearly every song showcases the group's ability's to sing together, as well as it showcases their own individial strengths. If you want creative, good music with a positive message, then I suggest you buy this cd.

Gary Allan skipped the sophomore slump with his second album, something that usually plagues new artists, but he seems comfortable on his 1998 album IT WOULD BE YOU. The album has the right balance between uptempo honky tonks and touching ballads. The album opens with the title track, one of his stronger singles. &quot;No Man In His Right Heart&quot; recounts a night where a man turns down a woman's offer, an offer no other man would refuse. &quot;Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long&quot; was co-written by Marty Stuart, its a fun honky tonk sure to please. &quot;I'll Take Today&quot; was another single from the album, a nice ballad about cherishing the time we spend in the present instead of relenting on the past. Other nice sentimental ballads include &quot;I Ain't Runnin' Yet&quot; and &quot;Baby I Will&quot;, and he does honky tonk on &quot;I've Got A Quarter In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Red Lips, Blue Eyes, Little White Lies&quot;. The album closes with &quot;Forgotten But Not Gone&quot;, a beautiful ballad, one of the best on the CD. There's also a hidden track called &quot;Judgement Day&quot; which is worth listening to. Overall this is a nice album, I think better than his first, so give it a listen!

Destiny's Child third album is out, titled Survivor, a very autobiographical title for their disc, after all of the drama in the group from last year. Beyonce Knowles writes most of the tracks on here, and its a strong effort. Independant Woman makes an appearance on the album, both Part I and Part II. The vocal quality has once again improved, with Beyonce and Kelly and Michelle, who also sing lead on certain songs. The big surprise though is the tender ballads near the end of the disc, Emotion and the sure to be a single Brown Eyes. As well there is a nice Gospel Medley which showcases their beautiful voices in harmony (like many tracks do). There are some nice upbeat songs, but there's no real Say My Name or Bills Bills Bills type songs here, but theres some nice ones which are even better. Its nice to see Beyonce sharing the spotlight with Kelly and Michelle, hopefully there will be less drama this time around. Overall Survivor stands as a strong album most way through the listen.

Kylie's recently found success again in the US, so what a better way to introduce new fans to what she did between Locomotion and Cant Get You Out of My Head, than to give some hits, as well as some rare fans. With HITS+, the compilation both satisfies established fans with its rare bsides and unreleased tracks, and craves the appetite of new fans who want more Kylie, to see where she came from. Hits like Confide In Me, Put Yourself In My Place, Where Is The Feeling?, from her self titled album, then Some Kind Of Bliss, Did It Again, Breathe, from her underrated 1997 album IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS, then some rare songs like If You Don't Love Me, and Tears. Then we have some unreleased tracks, Gotta Move On, Difficult By Design, Stay This Way, Automatic Love, Where Has The Love Gone?, Take Me With you, etc. Overall a must have, new fan or old.

Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features &quot;You Take It All&quot;, which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has &quot;When You Walk Away&quot;, which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like &quot;Alive Again&quot;, &quot;Song For The Lonely&quot;, &quot;Love One Another&quot;, which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding &quot;Love Is A Lonely Place Without You&quot;. The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced &quot;Body To Body, Heart To Heart&quot;, and &quot;Rain, Rain&quot;. The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than &quot;When The Money's Gone&quot;. I love her version of &quot;The Music's No Good Without You&quot;, which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. &quot;Real Love&quot; stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it. Overall LIVING PROOF is living proof, that Cher still has the goods!

After the artistic strength of 1999's MARY, to have NO MORE DRAMA is very much a disapointment. The album caters to the current R&amp;B/hip hop crowd, with some lifeless tracks. The album was even re-released and repackaged with new tracks and a new album cover (which is also awful I might add). There's a few tight joints here, PMS, Family Affair, No More Drama, 2U, etc but there is also some on the very weak side like Rainy Dayz (with that ever so awful and always in your face Ja Rule), Destiny, Where I've Been (feat. Eve), LOVE, Dance With Me, etc. There is almost no soul on this album, and it seems like a rushed project. Please bring the DRAMA back Mary, or come back with a better album than this. You could do much better...

Mary's latest effort NO MORE DRAMA finds Mary in an upbeat, positive mood. The aura flows from your speakers into your mind, leaving you with a positive vibe. Just as the title says, no more drama, so save it for yo momma! It's all about feeling good, having a good time. Mary relates with fans on a personal level on songs like PMS (feat. Lenny Kravitz on guitar), No More Drama and Testimony. You can get crunk with songs like Crazy Games, Family Affair, Dance With Me, and others. There's the love songs like the Missy produced Never Been, and the beautiful 2U. The album features tracks produced by Dr. Dre, Missy, Neptunes, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis and more. Go and pick up a copy, its well worth it, and stands as yet another strong album in the Mary J Blige library.

Share My World is one of Mary's best. It showcases her ability to choose songs that suit her voice, and to continue to make great music. There were many hit singles from the album, but all of the songs were off the hook.I Can Love You is a nice upbeat song with an awesome rap by Lil Kim. Love Is All We Need is a nice positive song, with a heavy back beat. Share My World is one of those funky tracks which makes you wanna groove all night. Seven Days is Mary's fave from the album, I have to agree its one of the best on the album. It's On is a nice duet with R. Kelly. My personal favorite on the album is the ballad Missing You, it expresses so many sentiments about the feelings one feels when they are missing someone. Everything was a hit and its no wonder why, its just one of those songs that makes you feel good. Near the end of the cd are some other great songs like Searching, the soulful Our Love, the hit Not Gon Cry and her cover of Natural Woman (at least on the Canadian version).This is a must for any fan of music. It makes you feel good and makes you want to dance. Go out and get it!

This is the import version of Janet's latest album, All For You. The only difference is it contains a bonus track, the upbeat song titled Who. Its a shame this did not make the US version, or the other versions of this album. Its truly a great song. On this album range with different styles of music: Come On Get Up (house/dance), You Aint Right (funk), Trust A Try (opera/rock), Someone To Call My Lover (pop, samples Ventura Highway), and it also contains a lot of ballads. These ballads are what Janet calls &quot;baby making songs&quot;. The best ballads are the sensual Feels So Right, Love Scene, When We Oooh, Would You Mind, and the positive Better Days. There is also a track featuring Carly Simon, Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You) which samples her hit You're So Vain, and features new lines written and spoken by Carly. As well there is the huge hit All For You, which is at its 7th week at #1 right now.All For You is essential for all of Janet's fans, new and old. It's something for everyone. There is a lot of genres on here, and I think by working with Rockwilder they have brought something new and interesting to the table. The album is somewhat explicit but its a sign of a woman growing into her own person, and once again becoming comfortable with many aspects of life. A must have.

Janet is finally back with a new song, and a new album on the way, both titled All For You. Last summer we were treated with Doesnt Really Matter from NPII, but this is the first song we've heard from one of her albums since 1998's Every Time, from 1997's The Velvet Rope. The album wont be out until April 24th, but its not too long until its released. All For You samples Glow of Love from Luther Vandross, which works very well with the arrangement of this song. This is the CD single of All For You, and it contains 2 tracks: All For You (Radio Edit), and All For You (Video Version). The US will not see a maxi single, but it will be released overseas, so you can import it. This is just a fun song, that will stay in your head, and it will bring a smile to your face. Go out and buy it, because Miss Jackson is back!

This is the import single, with 5 remixes:1. All For You (Radio Edit) (4:24) 2. All For You (DJ Quik Remix) (4:29) 3. All For You (Thunderpuss Club Mix) (10:28) 4. All For You (Rock Mix) (7:20) 5. All For You (Top Heavy Remix) (4:06)This is a great single for your collection, its worth the extra money. The DJ Quik Remix and Rock Mix are my favorites, they are slightly more edgier sounding with heavier beats, great to dance with. The Thunderpuss Club Mix is nice, I'm not a huge fan of long remixes but this one is good. The Top Heavy Remix is great as well. If you like All For You, this is for you because the remixes are great, this is one of her best maxi singles to date.

Finally fans are treated to Janet's first new album since 1997's introspective The Velvet Rope. All For You is an album filled with a variety of songs from various genres. There are the R&amp;B grooves, the tender ballads, the pop fluff songs and more. This time around Janet continues to work with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and a new voice Dana Stinson (Rockwilder). The result is remarkable.With All For You, it seems Janet has come into her own person once again, one who is comfortable with the place she is in currently. She is single and dating for the first time, she is experiencing many things for the first time in her life, and this is apparent in the music.First is an Intro where Janet is talking with a friend about a song's arrangement, and they are just having some fun. You Ain't Right is a song about losing trust in a close friend, feeling so sick about it. Next is the lead off single All For You, which has already hit #1 on the charts, this version is the album version which is slightly longer than the one played on radio and MTV. The 2wayforyou interlude is an interlude that is somewhat complicated listening to. Come On Get Up is just a fun party song about having fun and dancing, being with that loved one.The album starts off strong with upbeat, at this point it slows it down slightly with some nice ballads. When We Oooh is the perfect &quot;baby making song&quot; as she puts it, for any lovers to listen and relax with. China Love is a very beautiful, poignant love ballad. Things get even more sensual on the smooth Love Scene (Ooh Baby) that will get any lovers in the mood for lovin, where she describes making love with someone rather explicitly. Which is nothing compared to Would You Mind, a song where she asks her lover to perform various sexual acts, as well as describing how she will please him. At the end Janet gets close to orgasm, then cutting in with a quite comical line.In the next interlude titled Lame, she puts men in their place by letting them know they can be lame at times. The next track is standout for sure, single worthy. It is called Trust A Try, starting off very operetic, leading into a heavy rock guitar riff and a melody that will just stay in your head all day. It is like the If/What About/Black Cat of the album. Next might come as a surprise to many, it is a duet with Carly Simon. Janet wrote a song sampling Carly Simon's Your So Vain, and when she asked Carly for permission to use the sample Carly said she would help rewrite the song with Janet, no obligation. The result is a song where Janet puts those who have hurt her in their place, and no its not about Rene, her ex husband. Truth however, takes a look at Janet's life after marriage, and how truth will set you free.Next is an interlude where Janet gives her &quot;theory&quot; on whether they could work on the album later, or finish it now. The song leads into Someone To Call My Lover, which is set to be the second single from this album. It samples Ventura Highway, and is destined to become a summer hit. Feels So Right sets us back into the ballad mode, a beautiful ballad destined to become a single. Also featured is a slightly different version of her #1 hit from 2000, The Nutty Proffessor II, yes im talking about Doesn't Really Matter. The album closes with a personal song many could relate to, called Better Days, where she tries to set a frame of mind into optimism, knowing even though she is dealing with things, better days are to come. There is also a short Outro after this.All For You was well worth the wait. It is very pleasant to listen to, as Janet invites you into her world, her heart to express how she has been feeling as of late. Go out and get a copy, its a must have!

It's almost been five years since Mary Chapin Carpenter's last studio album, 1996's A Place In The World. This album is Time* Sex* Love*, perhaps some of her best work from her entire career. From the opening track Whenever You're Ready, which is an excellent song and opener for the album, to the final bonus hidden track, every song is excellent and an enjoyable listen. The album has a very reflective mood, about love, life and more. Her beautiful voice will calm and soothe you while listening, with its beautiful simplicity. Some highlights include Alone But Not Lonely, What Was It Like, King of Love, Simple Life, Swept Away and Whenever You're Ready. If you were somewhat disapointed with her last album, rest assured you will enjoy this one, its some of her best work lyrically and vocally.

This is an amazing album, by an amazing artist, home to the same record label as Whitney Houston. She has a voice for sure! The ballads on this cd are remarkable, such as The Sound Of my Tears, My First Night With You, Where Do We Go From Here and more. Then she goes upbeat on great songs like Sentimental, Who Do U Love, Im Your Natural Woman, It Could Of Been You and more. This is a must listen cd, you must hear it she is a hidden treasure in Canada, and she has recently broke through to the US but if you havent heard her you will not be disapointed to check this out, you wont regret it!

Whitney Houston went back to her roots with this soundtrack, where she started her career, which was singing gospel music. That remarkable voice has never been so strong and focused on its material. The music is featured in the 1996 motion picture The Preachers Wife, in which Whitney starred in alongside Denzel Washington.Most of the songs made an appearance in the movie, from stirring gospel music like Joy, Hold On Help Is On The Way, I Go To The Rock, I Love The Lord, Who Would Imagine A King, Joy To The World and more. There is also some new music from Whitney, which is more radio friendly. I Believe In You And Me appears on the soundtrack in both original version and single version, the original being more traditional in ballad form and the single version a little more radio friendly. Step By Step is also included twice, the original and a remix version. My Heart is Calling is another nice addition, but my favorite has to be You Were Loved, in my opinion one of the best Whitney Houston songs ever, its definately my favorite. This is something to check out for sure.This is a really nice soundtrack if you really liked the movie, or like this type of music. What prompted me to buy this was the fact that it was Whitney, but after seeing the movie, the music put me in such a good frame of mind that I knew I had to have it, this music is special and makes you happy. I highly reccomend it to everyone.

Love Will Always Win is a repackaged version of her 1998 album Faith. It contains many of the songs featured on that album, but with some bonuses. It contains pop versions of songs like This Kiss, Let Me Let Go and The Secret Of Life. As well it contains the live version of Piece of My Heart, It Matters To Me and my personal favorite, the title track Love Will Always Win. This is in my opinion her best song shes ever recorded, and I dont understand why it wasnt available on the domestic version. Its a very inspirational song, that will touch your soul and make you believe that a perfect love is possible to acheive. Thank you Faith Hill, for singing about truths, and affecting your fans lives like mine positively with your words and music. This is a must have and worth the extra money for this import.

My Heart was the long awaited album from Lorrie Morgan, her first since 1997's Shakin Things Up. The album is a bit of a departure from her past music. My Heart though is filled with some great material, and some not so great stuff. Songs like The Things We Do, I Did, Strong Enough To Cry, Maybe Not Tonight, Between Midnight and Tommorow, Never Been Good At Letting Go and My Heart are great songs. The other ones though are less than perfect, not to say they are so horrible, but they didnt really seem to suit her voice. This is by far not her best album, but its not that bad either.

Tuesday's Child is the long awaited return of Amanda Marshall. As a long time fan, I had been waiting since her 1995 debut for this album to come out, and I was pleasantly surprised because I got this cd the day it came out, May 25th 1999 on my birthday (that was the release date in Canada). The album is just as good as the first, with heartfelt songs, that will touch you and make you think about life. Highlights include I Believe In You, Love Lift Me, Shades of Gray, Too Little Too Late, Giving Up Giving In and Out Of Bounds. Check this out if you want a great cd that you will listen to all the time, this is the one.

Deana Carter is back with a new album, IM JUST A GIRL, and its great that she is back. I missed her unique music and spirit in country music, and it's good to see there is some good airplay for the album's first single, &quot;There's No Limit&quot;. The album is her first in 4 and a half years, since her second album was released in 1998, which didn't fare too well for her sadly. She went through a divorce, and a label change, which is why this album took so long she once explained in an interview. The album has a reminiscent feel to her first album, as well as new elements, there is more of a rock element to the music.The album opens with the title track, a fun piece of country-pop heaven, would make an excellent summer single. Then there is the current single, &quot;There's No Limit&quot;, which is a fun uptempo song about devotion and love, I love the guitar solo in the break as well as Deana's warm vocals. &quot;You &amp; Tequila&quot; is one of the better ballads of the album, about the negative effects of alcohol. &quot;Me And The Radio&quot; is a must single, excellent ballad.&quot;Cover of a Magazine&quot; is a fun uptempo song, but its very true, about how fickle society can be and just wanting a taste of what other people live like. I enjoy &quot;Wildflower&quot;, its a nice ballad/midtempo that suits her vocals well. &quot;Twice As Worth it&quot; has some unique instrumentation I quite enjoy. &quot;Eddie&quot; is another fun uptempo summer love song.&quot;Waiting&quot; is a surprise, her first duet, and its with Dwight Yoakam. You have to hear it to believe it. &quot;Liar&quot; is a rock edged uptempo song. &quot;Goodbye Train&quot; is one of my favorites on the album, another potential single, this one was written with Matraca Berg. The album closes with the rocker &quot;Girl's Night&quot; which is interesting and unique, a nice closer.Overall, I am enjoying Deana's new music quite a bit. It's good to see she still has a place in country music, and that people haven't forgotten about her, because she is a true talent in the industry.

I dont care what anyone says, Toni Braxton has a beautiful voice. She can use her voice in many ways which makes her exciting, and she is very good at singing ballads. This is the CD single for her Spanish Guitar song, written by Diane Warren. The remixes are tight, my favorite are the Royal Garden's Flamenco Mix, HQ2 Radio Edit, but the others are nice. This is a little pricey but its worth it, this is one of her best songs and I wish it was played more in the US because we are missing out here!

Riding the wave of young turks delving into old-school soul that includes D'Angelo, Eryka Badu and Adriana Evans, Maxwell's URBAN HANG SUITE heralded the arrival of a balladeer who combined Al Green's seductiveness with Prince's sensuality. MTV UNPLUGGED shows off the live side of this young free spirit whose musical roots reach through the Quiet Storm into some pretty unlikely places. Throughout this EP, the arrangements are lush, the horns caress every groove and Maxwell's creamy falsetto ducks and feints through his own &quot;Whenever Wherever Whatever&quot; and &quot;The Lady Suite.&quot; He also takes time to give props to Kate Bush with a crystalline reading of &quot;This Woman's Work.&quot; Showing off a knack for the unorthodox, Maxwell closes out the festivities with a completely transformed cover of Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Closer&quot; that moves from a jazz/funk workout to a gospel feel.

Lets Talk About Love, hot off the heels of her 1996 album Falling Into You, continues to prove that Celine is one of the greatest singers in the 90's. Filled with guest artists such as Carol King, Bee Gees, Luchiano Pavorotti, Barbra Streisand and more. This album, mostly ballad driven, is one of her best recordings.My favorite track is the mega ballad duet with Barbra Streisand called Tell Him. This is to me the strongest of the tracks. It was genius to have them sing together, as they are spectacular artists and they work well together. Another favorite is the ballad titled Us, a very powerful song in which Dion delivers the goods. Other strong tracks include Lets Talk About Love, Where Is The Love, The Reason (with Carol King), Immortality (with Bee Gees), Miles To Go (Before I Sleep), and many others. The only tracks I dont really care for are I Hate You Then I Love You and Amar Haciendo El Amor (I have the Canadian copy which replaces Amar Haciendo El Amor with To Love You More).Overall this is an excellent album and I highly reccomend it.

Deborah Cox is one of Canada's best talents out there. She is the Canadian Whitney Houston. Her soulful voice will move you. This album is no exception, on songs like September, We Cant Be Friends (With RJ From Next), Nobody's Supposed To Be Here, Couldn't We, I Never Knew etc she shines as she takes you through stories about relationships and love. Theres also some upbeat songs like One Wish and One Day You Will which are very nice as well. Also there are remixes at the end of the cd for Nobody's Supposed To Be Here, Things Just Aint The Same and September (hidden track). You must check out this woman, she has soulful music with meaning.

Mariah's 2nd album builds on her debut, and is somewhat better than her debut. &quot;Emotions&quot; is a fun uptempo early 90s dance jam that suits her vocals well, she even shows off a little in a good way. Same goes for &quot;Make It Happen&quot;, reminds me a bit of &quot;Someday&quot; from her debut, another strong track. The ballads are what are memorable for me here. &quot;So Blessed&quot; is one of her best ballads, and equally impressive is &quot;And You Don't Remember&quot;, and &quot;Till The End of Time&quot;. Some tracks are filler, like &quot;You're So Cold&quot;, but overall Mariah's second album is pretty good.

This in my opinion is Mariah Carey's signature song, her career song. Never have I heard such an uplifting beautiful song that expresses so many fears and emotions, and believing in yourself to see the true hero, as she sings in this song. It is touching, it gets you right in the heart every time you hear it. It gives you faith and makes you believe that you are a worthwhile person who can change the world in your own little way. This is a must have for all people, to hear great music and just to hear when you are in doubt of yourself, it will heal you.

Under The Pink is yet another chapter in Tori Amos' career. With every cd she brings new sounds, new meanings, new insights on life. She is real. Everything she sings, everything she plays is real and something she is feeling inside her heart. This album is beautiful with the wonderful arrangements she does with the piano. She sings about life and in a way teaches us. They are mature lyrics. Highlights on the album include Pretty Good Year, Bells For Her, Baker Baker, Cornflake Girl, Icicle, Cloud On My Tongue (my fave). The whole album is wonderful and a must have for music lovers!

Bette Midler outdid herself with the movie Beaches, and with this soundtrack. It is the perfect soundtrack, with an array of different songs. The movie was spectacular, the soundtrack is too. It brings a tear to my eye every time, with songs like Wind Beneath My Wings, even the instrumental Friendship Theme. The songs are original, such as Otto Titsling, Oh Industry, Baby Mine, and more. She does justice to her covers of Under The Boardwalk, and I Know You By Heart. If you want an album of songs that make you laugh, cry, and feel good, you need this album.

SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES is my favorite album by Bette Milder, along with the BEACHES soundtrack. The album has everything you would come to expect from a Bette Midler album, and more. Miss Otis Regrets is the campy type song we all love to hear from Bette, she does them so well. The big hit on the album is From A Distance, very inspirational and beautiful. Night and Day is a beautiful song as well, I just love that song. There is a loneliness and sadness that resonates in songs like Some People's Lives, or Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most. There are upbeat songs like One More Round, All of a Sudden. I truly love Moonlight Dancing, a beautifully written and arranged song. Overall this is a very good album, filled with talent and great songs!

Martina McBride's 5th studio effort proves to be her best yet. Yes it is more pop country than country, but good music does not have to be limited to just one genre. She sings with the voice you know and love, she sings songs about love and about letting go, she tells stories. She takes on different roles in each song, but they are all great songs.I Love You is the lead off single, also featured on the Runaway Bride soundtrack, its a fun bubblegum country song. The second single is the positive song Love's The Only House. Her current single is There You Are, from the movie Where The Heart Is.Other mentionable songs include the upbeat Do What You Do, the catchy Make Me Believe, It's My Time, I Ain't Going Nowhere, the power ballad Goodbye, and more.Martina McBride is one of country's best, if you don't know that you most likely will after listening to this album.

Me And You is Kenny Chesney's third album, and a great album at that. Kenny shows us once again his romantic side on ballads like When I Close My Eyes, Me And You and more. There's also the get up and dance and sing songs like Back In My Arms Again, Back Where I Come From and more. His voice is beautiful and it harmonizes beautifully. This is a great album, I highly reccomend it.

Wynonna is back in full force! It's been 3 and a half years since 2000's NEW DAY DAWNING. That album experimented in rock, R&amp;B, and soul. Wynonna returns with a bit of a country tinge, Wynonna style, it's not your typical country but for her it works. The song selection is great! The title track was a mild hit at country radio, cracking the top 15. The next single is the big ballad of the album, &quot;Heaven Help Me&quot;, which should be a hit for her if there's any justice. She is reunited with mother Naomi as the Judds on their cover of &quot;Flies On The Butter (You Can't Go Home Again)&quot;, which is well worth the price of admission.There's a few inspirational songs, like her cover of &quot;I Will Be&quot;, but the true standout is &quot;Your Day Will Come&quot;, with a memorable chorus that lifts your soul and makes you believe. her version of &quot;Burning Love&quot; which was featured in LILO AND STITCH last summer in 2002, is another keeper. She also does a favorable cover of Foreigner's &quot;I Want To Know What Love Is&quot;. The closing &quot;Rescue Me&quot; is sad but hopeful. Also included is her song &quot;You Are&quot; which was featured in Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU movie back in 2000.I think the true standout of the album is the ballad &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Elvis&quot;, its a great song that is very relatable. Other mentionable songs on the album include &quot;It All Comes Down To Love&quot; (which was the first title for the cd), &quot;Who Am I Supposed To Love&quot; and &quot;No One's Gonna Break Me Down&quot;. Welcome back Wy!

This collection is a good reminder of what kind of artist Madonna is. Look at the song selection. Erotica, Bedtime Story, Human Nature, songs like these would be considered risks, and Madonna does take risks which is why she released them. Sure they didn't chart but it shows the makings of a true artist. She doesn't care what goes to #1, she just releases quality songs. GHV2 is a collection of some of her best songs from the 90s, ranging from all her albums from Erotica to Music, and everything in between. Not many artists could do the things Madonna does, and if they could they probably wouldn't, she's in a class of her own. Songs like Rain, This Used To Be My Playground, You'll See, were probably not included because they ended up on her 1995 ballad compilation SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Yes there are songs missing, but lets celebrate the great songs that are on this cd, this is just another reminder of what a true gifted artist Madonna is, and I predict it wont be long until we see the next chapter of her hits, in another cd.

Chely Wright's new album NEVER LOVE YOU ENOUGH is a treat for the ears. It was definately worth the wait. NYLE is filled with great songs, many of which she wrote with Brad Paisley such as One Night in Las Vegas, Horoscope, and Not As In Love. In fact Chely helped write 5 of the 12 songs. Each song shows a different personality from Chely. Never Love You Enough is a beautiful, inspiring, soaring ballad. What If We Fly is a very inspirational, uplifting song. Wouldn't It Be Cool features Trisha Yearwood on backing vocals, it's a cute little song, definately radio material. Love Didn't Listen is a nice upbeat song with a nice chorus and message. The final track Deep Down Low was written by Chely, its a nice song as well. Other great songs include Jezebel, One Night In Las Vegas, Not As In Love, While I was waiting and Horoscope. This is one of her most accessible albums yet, its filled to the brim with quality and a sweet voice to go with it.

Celine's All The Way A Decade of Song and Video is a collection of 17 of Celine's videos/live performances. Although not all of Celine's videos are here, it covers a wide range. From the empowering The Power of Love, to It's All Coming Back To Me Now, Im Your Angel (with R Kelly), If You Asked Me To, etc as well as her new songs in video form, like Thats The Way It Is, If Walls Could Talk, Then You Look At Me, Live, I Want You To Need Me, etc. There are various live performances, such as Beauty and the Beast (sung with one of her background singers), which I would have liked to see in original form, Because You Love Me (which I would of preferred to see as the original video), those were both taken from her 1997 Memphis concert. There is also some live performances from her 1999 All The Way Special, the songs being The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and All The Way.An added bonus is the inclusion of Misled, which didnt make it onto the CD and cassette of All The Way. My only complaint about this video collection: unnessesary live performances, replacing the original videos, and the missing videos not included on here, the songs not even on the cd/cassette such as Tell Him (with Barbra Streisand), Immortality (with the Bee Gees), Water From The Moon, etc. I didnt find All The Way to be a really complete Greatest Hits package, but maybe with The Collectors Series we will continue to see her hits appear in collections on cd.This is a nice career video retrospective of Celine Dion's career. A must for fans!

A little more than two years after she released her sophomore album, Foxy Brown returns with a world of experiences to talk about on BROKEN SILENCE. This album is a testament to the life the hip-hop femme fatale has lived, and it's her most truthful work to date. From the vagaries of love to life's struggles to the business of music, Brown completely opens up, detailing every last secret that has haunted her career.On &quot;A Letter,&quot; she dedicates a verse to her mother and each of her brothers, apologizing for her mistakes. Then on &quot;730,&quot; a bouncy track produced by Loafey, Foxy speaks directly to another woman who's trying to rain on her parade. But that doesn't mean that the entire album is about heartache, as reggae-influenced songs like &quot;Tables Will Turn,&quot; featuring Baby Cham, and &quot;Oh Yeah,&quot; featuring Spragga Benz, introduce a new wrinkle to Brown's rapping style. She also honors her roots by paying homage to her hometown Brooklyn on &quot;BK Anthem.&quot;

The new Missy Elliot album is off the hook...its not really a rap album, or R&amp;B, it is an eclectic collection of music that lends to rap, R&amp;B and mostly dance. The impressive thing about the album is its ability to get you up dancing, it's impossible not to. The beats are texturized and mesmerizing, addictive. There was a lot of effort in the production, which was worth it. The album is one of the best to come out so far this year. I bought it because I loved Get UR Freak On, and I love it. So if you love that song, chances are you will love this album.

Lenny Kravitz started his career in the mid to late 80s, and his first album was Let Love Rule. The message was of importance, it was love and acceptance. Mama Said was released in 1991 and did very well, as did his 1993 album Are You Gonna Go My Way. His 1995 album Circus was his reaction to the media, who made him feel as though his life was a circus that everyone was watching. 5 was his next album in 1998, later rereleased in 1999 with 2 extra tracks. This album is an anthology of his hits from those albums, with an added bonus of the new song called Again. This is a must for fans of Kravitz.

HOPE FLOATS was a touching movie starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Conick Jr and Gena Rowlands. The music really accompanied the movie well. By far the standout on the soundtrack is Sheryl Crow's &quot;In Need&quot; which stands with even her best songs. It's sort of mellowed out rock with great lyrics. I also qnjoy &quot;Wither I'm A Flower&quot; by Whiskeytown, another great song. The duet &quot;Chances Are&quot; with Bob Segar and Martina McBride might sound like an unlikely duo but it's not, it actually is a great song and they work well together vocally. Bryan Adams' &quot;When You Love Someone&quot; comes at the end of the movie and is very poignant and beautiful. Another favorite is Deana Carter's touching ballad &quot;What Makes You Stay&quot;. There's two version of Bob Dylan's &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot;, one by Garth Brooks the other by Trisha Yearwood. Other highlights include &quot;To Get Me To You&quot; by Lila McCann, &quot;Paper Wings&quot; by Gillian Welch and &quot;Stop In The Name of Love&quot; by Jonell Mosser. This is an exceptional soundtrack that trandescends genres.

A one-off deal with Arista, and a return to form, of sorts: it's brimming over with instrumental, vocal and compositional brilliance, but he has nothing much to say. As usual, the styles are all over the map, shifting from tuneless experiments with synthesized noise (&quot;Undisputed&quot; with a Chuck D. rap, the 80's holdover title track, &quot;Strange But True&quot;) to gorgeous layered love songs (&quot;The Sun, The Moon And Stars,&quot; &quot;Man'O'War&quot;) without stopping for breath. When the approach works (the 90 second acoustic guitar-plus-percussion &quot;Tangerine&quot;) he sounds like a genius; when it doesn't (the dull electrofunk &quot;Hot Wit U&quot;) he comes across as a genre-assimilating showoff. He doesn't play much guitar this time out, though there's a stinging solo on the rocker &quot;So Far, So Pleased,&quot; which features No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani. Continuing the cavalcade of stars, there's a double dose of Sheryl Crow: she adds faint vocals to the lame-brained party rocker &quot;Baby Knows,&quot; and he funks up her hit &quot;Everyday Is A Winding Road&quot; more than it ever deserved. Other guests include Ani DiFranco, Eve, and Maceo Parker (on the Morris Day-style parody &quot;Prettyman&quot;). I doubt this'll be the disc to send him back to the top of the charts, but it's certainly his most radio-ready effort since his last major-label release, Emancipation

The Velvet Rope is one of Janet's best albums to date. The album deals with personal issues such as acceptance, specialness, as well as world issues such as homophobia and the hate it causes, AIDS, domestic abuse and more. This is a painful dark album, you can tell Janet lived through this. But all through all there is a message, to feel special because we are all special. This album version from Japan also includes a bonus track not available on the US version of The Velvet Rope, a song called God's Stepchild which is worth the price. Very beautiful music here.

This is my favorite Jewel album. The lyrics aren't too meandering (or at all) and the music is just nice and reflective. The ballads are what work best here. The title track is one of my favorites, even though in the liner notes she said she hated singing it. &quot;I Wont Walk Away&quot; is a nice jazzy kind of ballad. A lot of people don't like &quot;Cleveland&quot; because it's &quot;too country&quot;, but I love it. I'd actually like to see her do a true country album. &quot;Till We Run Out Of Road&quot; and &quot;Do You Want To Play&quot; are other great ballads. A lot of people love &quot;Serve The Ego&quot;, but I could take it or leave it. &quot;Love Me, Just Leave Me Alone&quot; is EXCELLENT. &quot;Break Me&quot; and &quot;Standing Still&quot; were great singles too. Overall a solid collection of music.

Amanda Marshall's latest CD EVERYBODY'S GOT A STORY, which is already in stores in Canada, but will be available in the US and the rest of the world Spring 2002, is a breath of fresh air. Her first album AMANDA MARSHALL was a gem in disguise, filled with great songs, as was her sophomore effort TUESDAYS CHILD. This is a more grown up effort from Amanda, with songs that tell us abit about who she is. The songs are cleverly written, many with a sense of humor, others with a sense of honesty and a feeling of no fear. "Double Agent" is pershaps the most honest song she has ever delivered about who she is, an obvious standout on the album. "Everybody Has A Story" the first single, is a universal song of acceptance which is both catchy and stimulating to the mind at the same time. The second single "Sunday Morning After" is a fun song, about waking up without any recolection of where you were the night before. Perhaps one of the most beautiful songs on the album is "Marry Me", a beautiful song about commitment and love. Coming in close though is the power ballad "Love Is My Witness". "Brand New Beau" marks the stunning realization that her boyfriend is really gay, and has been cheating on her, a great song with lots of jazz influence. For this album, Amanda enlisted New York DJ Molecules, who helped with most of the album. Overall this is a new direction for Amanda, and fans will either reject or accept this new image of hers. The music is still great, and this fan isn't complaning. Give this CD a try!

Jewel is back with a new album and a new look and sound. That is the only differences between this Jewel and Jewel of the past. The introspective songwriting is still here, it's just backed with dance beats and a more polished sound that her folk/country stuff from previous albums. Yes Jewel has gone pop, but her music still has substance. Many accuse her of selling out, but she hasn't, this style of music isn't what is all over the place right now. The first single &quot;Intution&quot; is a piece of pop heaven, that has proven to be a big hit for her, and people seem to enjoy her new style. There's so many good songs that could be singles like &quot;Stand&quot;, &quot;Run 2 U&quot;, &quot;2 Find U&quot;, &quot;Fragile Heart&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, etc. This is a great album, give it a try and keep an open mind.

Jolene is where Dolly's roots are, it was that era where some of her most memorable music came from, this cd being no exception whatsoever. This is pure gold. There are classics on this cd such as Jolene, the original version of I Will ALways Love You, Lonely Comin Down, and other memorable songs lik River of Happiness, Early Morning Breeze, and It Must Be You. All the songs are winners. This is a must have, and a great place for new fans of Dolly to start their collection. Go out and get it if you already havent!

At times AMERICAN LIFE is brilliant, songs like "Nobody Knows Me", "Nothing Fails", "Intervention", where Madonna reaches her pivotal peak on the record in terms of lyric and sentiment. Whereas other songs, she falls flat. Like the bland "Hollywood" which I think is too glossy, or the mixed up "I'm So Stupid". Even the title track is trite and I hardly expect Madonna expects anyone to take it seriously but the song is a joke in itself. Same goes for "X-Static Process". Why all the religious references? I thought we covered this on another album. It's very overbearing. "Mother and Father" is an interesting song that somehow works. Definately not her best. Actually comes as a disapointment mainly.

Everywhere is Tim McGraw's 1997 album, and if there was any doubt about the future of his career, this album helped determine which road he would head towards, a road towards stardom as one of country music's favorites.The album is both fun and sentimental. On songs like Where The Green Grass Grows, Aint That The Way It Always Ends, Hard On The Ticker and You Turn Me On all show this fun side of Tim, one that makes you want to sing and dance along with the cd. Then another side is the sentimental side, on songs like Its Your Love, I Do But I Dont, One Of These Days, Everywhere and Just To See You Smile.The album was very successful. The first single Its Your Love featured Faith Hill on background vocals, and it became an instant wedding song and an instant hit, holding at #1 for six weeks straight on country charts, a record which would soon be Tied by Tim with his third single, Just To See You Smile which also spent six weeks at the top of the country charts. The second single was the title song, Everywhere a beautiful song about a memory of a loved one that will always be around him, because everywhere he goes it reminds him. One of These Days was the fourth single, a very beautiful ballad that will wrench your heart and bring tears, about being teased as a child and beliving one day you would grow above it stronger and loved. Where The Green Grass Grows was the fifth single, a nice fun song, and the sixth single was For A Little While. All of the songs did very well with country radio, making Tim one of the best singers out there and soon one of the most popular. It was odd to have 6 singles out of an 11 song collection, but it was well worth it.This album is a must have. It has so many moods. Happy songs, sad songs, songs about remembering, about growing, being stronger. When you listen you can feel the joy, the pain, as Tim's voice can only express in a song. This is simply a must have you wont regret it.

This is the Dolly collection you want, if you are a fan of her music from early in her career when she was more country. If you are looking for her more pop-country sound, try Volume One of the Essential Series. This collection highlights some of the best songs in Dolly's career. From the simplistic songs that weve grown to love like Touch Your Woman, The Bargain Store, Coat of Many Colors, My Tennessee Mountain Home, to songs like Heartbreaker, I Really Got The Feeling, I Will ALways Love You, Light Of A Clear Blue Morning and more, there is a wide collection here. This will have to satisfy you until RCA realizes no matter how many Dolly Greatest Hits released, there is no proper collection until we get a boxed set covering her whole career and all her hits, but this is a nice place to start.

Shakin Things Up is a truly good collection of music from a very talented artist, Lorrie Morgan. Its a shame this album didn't get as much recognition as it deserved, it contains some of her best material. Go Away was one of the best country songs from 1997, with a great video to go along with it. However country radio was lukewarm with the material from this album. Every song is a winner. One Of Those Nights Tonight was another fun song, about a woman who craves a little more out of life. I'm Not That Easy To Forget is a nice song for those who have recently left a relationship, this is your song. Finshing Touch is a fun song that was single worthy, really fun, the kinda stuff I like to hear Lorrie sing. The final three tracks, You Think Hed Know Me Better, Will You Love Me Tommorow and In A Perfect World are classic Lorrie songs. This is one of her best albums, you simply must hear it, some great material on here.

The hits on this collection include Five Minutes, Dear Me, Except For Monday, A Picture Of Me (Without You), Watch Me, Something In Red, Dont Worry Baby, What Part of No, and some new tracks. Of those included are Back In Your Arms Again, I Didnt Know My Own Strength, and a remake of the Keith Whitley song as a duet Til A Tear Becomes A Rose. You must get this cd if you are looking for one of country greatest singers, this is her and these are just a few of her hits.

Kenny Chesney is a very talented artist, who is sometimes overlooked and underrated in country music. Many people in fact think of him still in 2001 as a &quot;new&quot; artist, but his debut was out in 1993, and this is his second album, titled All I Need To Know. The album is a nice country album with his beautiful smooth country voice. These are some of his best songs. Key tracks include Fall In Love, Grandpa Told Me So, All I Need To Know and The Tin Man. If you arent familiar with his older music like this album, I suggest you give it a try. Hes a great singer.

Ten Thousand Angels was Mindy's first breakthrough album in country music, also her debut album. She travelled to Nashville, told her parents if she didnt have a record deal within a year she would return home and go to college, and about 50 weeks after being in Nashville, she was signed with BNA Nashville. The debut single Ten Thousand Angels was a popular hit and made it well on the charts, but the real breakthrough on the album was the woman's anthem Guys Do It All The Time, which will always be remembered for its sassyness and honesty, a fun song which hit #1. The 10 tracks on the album each reflect a different side of Mindy, both playful and fun, as well as serious and strong. Other singles include the duet with Richie McDonald from Lonestar called Maybe He'll Notice Her Now, the anthem A Girl's Gotta Do (What A Girl's Gotta Do). Other mentionable songs include All That I Am, Breakin It, and It Ain't A Party. Go out and get this spectacular debut by one of country's best singers.

Greater Need is probably my favorite Lorrie Morgan album. There are some great songs here. Soldier of Love is a great album starter, would of made a great single for country radio. I Just Might Be is a little tough, but its a nice song. Greater Need is a beautiful ballad, one you will love as it comes from Lorrie's heart. Steppin Stones is a really upbeat country tune with Travis Tritt and Vince Gill singing on it as well, they really kick it up. By My Side is a nice duet with her then husband Jon Randall. Good as I Was to You was the big hit from this album, along with By My Side, she sings it like no one else could. She Walked Beside The Wagon just touches your heart like no other song could, Lorrie brings that magic touch to the songs with her golden voice. A must have.

MY BODY THE HAND GRENADE is a grab-bag collection of rarities, outtakes, and live cuts, mostly from the earlier phase of the group's career (i.e., before theycared much about pop hooks). It's uneven, as you would imagine; in fact, there are times when lead singer Courtney Love's incessant yammering over a backdrop of sludge guitars verges on genre parody. But &quot;Burn Black&quot; and &quot;Dicknail&quot; in particular are powerful helpings of vintage riot grrrl, and the live cuts (from an appearance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;) are terrific, in particular the conceptual coup of covering the sickest girl-group song of the '60s, Carole King's masochistic &quot;He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss).&quot; Rock criticism doesn't come any neater.

George Michael's career retrospective Ladies And Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael, is a must have. The first disc titled &quot;for the heart&quot; is a collection of George's greatest ballads, 14 tracks, everything from Jesus to a Child, You Have Been Loved, Careless Whisper, Cowboys and Angels, and more. The second disc is titled &quot;for the feet&quot;, a collection of his upbeat dance numbers such as Fastlove, Freedom, Spinning The Wheel, Hard Day, Monkey, I Want Your Sex, I Knew You Were Waiting and more, a total of 14 more tracks. This is 28 song collection and Epic does a wonderful job of getting the hits here. George Michael has made some of the most memorable music and this a collection of his best, so you can remember all those great songs that you once loved, perhaps you still do. Essential.

Kelly Price returns with Mirror Mirror, her sophmore effort. It leads up to its expectations, and even more! She is a wonderful singer and has a beautiful voice. You feel like she is singing just for you, like she was your friend or something. My favorites include the title track (AWESOME). I Know Who Holds Tommorow and As We Lay, you can just feel the power and emotion in her voice. Another touching song is The Lullaby, which is dedicated to her children, who sing with her. I think Kelly should duet with Mary J Blige. They would sound great together. If you like R&amp;B/soul type music, this is a great cd for you!

Kelly Price has returned, and just when you think she couldnt get any better than on her Soul of A Woman album, she has proven those who didn't think so or believe she could surpass the raw emotion and talent with even more on this new album, Mirror Mirror. The songs on this album will touch your heart and maybe even change your views on life. She covers a variety of issues on this album. The funky Good Love sets the pace for this album, its a nice groove that will keep you singing along. At Least (The Little Things) is a midtempo song about a woman who is leaving a relationship where the man does not show in any way he cares or loves her. She Wants You is a classic ballad about a woman realizing that she is not the only one who has eyes for her man. Mirror Mirror simply is one of the best tracks on the cd, this is such raw emotion and honesty, it really rings true. The Lullaby is a touching song Kelly dedicates to her children, who also sing on the track. As We Lay is simply amazing, a remake of the 1984 Shirley Murdock hit, she does the remake so originally and it is simply beautiful, her voice is strong and breathtaking. Her remake of I Know Who Holds Tommorow is also simply amazing. On Mirror Mirror, Kelly brings back what was missing in the current R&amp;B/Soul situation, true soul that stirrs your inner soul and heart, and touches you unlike anything other. Great job Kelly, we love you.

Linda Davis, best-known for her Grammy-winning duet with Reba McEntire, &quot;Does He Love You,&quot; signed to DreamWorks in 1998 and was given almost no timeto complete her album. That's why I'M YOURS features seven previously released songs, as well as seven new ones. In effect, IM YOURS serves as a kind of &quot;audio scrapbook&quot; of Davis' career, revealing her to be an immensely talented singer whose past work has been cruelly overlooked. In fact, two of the tracks here, &quot;In Pictures&quot; and &quot;What Do I Know,&quot; went on to become hits for Alabama and Ricochet respectively, proving that Davis knows how to pick a song.Her first top 10 single, &quot;Some Things Are Meantto Be,&quot; still sounds great, while &quot;Company Time&quot; and &quot;Three Way Tie&quot; are shoulda-been-hits. The new material ranges from the uptempo title track, to the sassy &quot;I Took the Torch Out of His Old Flame,&quot; to &quot;From the Inside Out,&quot; a mediation on the meaning of true love. There's also a duet with Randy Travis, &quot;Make It Through,&quot; originally recorded for the PRINCE OF EGYPT soundtrack. Travis' deeper-than-deep voice provides an interesting contrast with Davis' soprano on this unique song inspired by the story ofMoses.

The Tour is a compilation of songs from Mary's Share My World Tour. It includes hits from What's the 411 (Reminisce, Real Love, Sweet Thing), My Life (Im The Only Woman, Marys Joint, Mary Jane, etc), Share My World (Everything, I Can Love You, Missing You, etc) and some bonus (Misty Blue, Daydreaming, Not Gon Cry). Many of the songs in the beggining are just shortened versions, which is a bit disapointing, but not too much. The biggest dissapointment for me was that guy who was yelling in each song, it became very annoying hearing 'say what!' and 'where the ladies at!' every two seconds while mary sings, unnessesary. I only wish they release a tour cd or video for The Mary Show because that was off the hook. To make up for the shortened songs, many of the songs are extended versions (Everything, Missing YOu, Not Gon Cry). Mary even does Lil Kim's rap on I Can Love You! I reccomend this cd to anyone who wants to hear a really good live show, by one of music finest performers.

As a fan of the original Ecco The Dolphin, I was eagerly anticipating the release of Ecco on the Dreamcast. I was not disapointed. This game has simply the best graphics the Dreamcast has to offer, in my opinion. Beautiful underwater graphics and realistic looking. The gameplay is wonderful. The controls are hard to learn, but its one of those challenging parts of a games youll love. The storyline is really good, I wont give away any of the goodies. Youll have to play yourself. I really reccomend this game, its a lot of fun!

P!nk's newest album MISSUNDAZSTOOD is probably her smartest offering yet, which I know is hard to say since its only her sophomore album. Ditching the R&B act, she goes in favor of a more rock oriented sound, thanks to the help of Linda Perry who was involved in most of this album. The result is a smart album, filled with deeply personal songs about demanding respect from guys, disfunctional family values and dealing with the problems, personal issues, and other issues many people in this life can relate to. Perhaps the most poignant and beautiful song on this album is the closing track, "My Vietnam". However, there are other strong points here, including "Family Portrait", "Gone To California", "Eventually", etc. Linda Perry joins P!nk on the track "Lonely Girl", and Steven Tyler joins her on "Misery". The only mis-step on this album is "Get This Party Started" and the title track, which just don't seem to fit the overall vibe of the album. Another mis-step in the same vein, the songs "Just Like A Pill" and "Don't Let Me Get Me" are almost identical, in their messages and meanings underneath. Otherwise this is a song set. P!nk shows us that she has the makings of a great pop star, who is worthy of that title, she provides music with in depth meaning underneath it all, unlike Miss Nobody Spears. Give this one a try!

I Finally Found Someone, the much anticipated album from Sammy Kershaw and Lorrie Morgan, featuring 6 duets, and 3 solo songs from each artist. The album is pleasant to listen to, quite romantic. The title track is a cover of the 1996 mega hit for Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams, while Kershaw and Morgan have done a decent job at this song, in no way it matches the emotional passion and deliverance you can feel from the original song (which is no complaint, in most cases the original is much better than the cover version). The album is great to listen to, to hear these two talented individuals sing together, obviously so much in love, which they can now profess to each other openly. Its too bad Morgan is without a contract, she has by far one of the most individual, most distinctive voices in country music today. The album overall is very nice and a good collection of material. A must for the true romantic.

I remember when this cd was released, late in the summer of 1997. I was waiting anxiously for its release. How Do I Live was in constant rotation on radio and on CMT all summer long and it was so hard waiting for this cd, which might sound strange since this is a Greatest Hits CD, but I was really looking forward to its release, and I wasn't disapointed.First lets start with the beautiful cover photo, she look sso elegant and classy, the perm look is great on Trisha, she looks beautiful. The album starts with the one of the three new songs featured on this cd, How Do I Live, from the movie ConAir, a song that became very popular for Trisha, almost a career song one would say. Next are two big hits for Trisha, the beautiful poignant The Song Remembers When, then the upbeat on your feet song Wrong Side of Memphis. Next song is a duet with Garth Brooks, another new song on this collection, called In Anothers Eyes, which also became a very big hit. The Woman Before Me is the next hit on the cd, a nice tender ballad.Perfect Love is the third new song, coincidently it hit #1 on country charts, the only new upbeat song on the album. The rest of the album contains hits such as Thinkin About You, DOwn On My Knees, Shes In Love With The Boy, Walkaway Joe, XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl) and Like We Never Had A Broken Heart. 12 songs total, 9 hits and 3 new songs which also became hits. It would of been nice to see some other hits on here, like Believe Me Baby (I Lied), Everybody Knows, On A Bus To St. Cloud, etc, but many of these are on the import version of this album, and perhaps with the next greatest hits colleciton these and more will be included.Trisha Yearwood is the most talented female country singer, she may not always get recognition for her talent, but just listen to this and any of her albums and you will release what a true gem she is.

I laughed when I first heard Mariah Carey's newest album would be called CHARMBRACELET. Still as a fan I wanted to hear it, so of course I bought it immediately. CHARMBRACELET is a step in the right direction, but it still falters in a few areas. The hip hop just isn't working for her. Once again we have meaningless collaborations. &quot;Boy (I Need You)&quot; samples Cam'ron's song, and he is also included on the track. It's a weak sample and lazy track. &quot;You Got Me&quot; is another meaningless collaboration with Jay Z, this time with Freeway in the mix. Jermaine Dupri produces a number of tracks, and also ruins &quot;The One&quot;, which would be a nice song without his voice all over it. While &quot;Irresistible&quot; is funky, the rappers ruin it for me. On a lighter more positive note, Mariah has returned to signature ballads. The first single &quot;Through The Rain&quot; is an inspiring song of courage and perseverance, very fitting considering what she has been going through as of late. &quot;My Saving Grace&quot; shows Mariah in a gospel mood, a nice inpspiring cut that she shines on. &quot;I Only Wanted&quot; is very relatable, and a nice ballad altogether. Other highlights include &quot;Yours&quot;, &quot;Clown&quot;, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Flowers For Alfred Roy&quot; and more. Overall not her best but a step in the right direction, she just needs to drop the collaborations, they are tired.

Stranger In Moscow is one of the best songs from Michael Jackson's 30 year career as a solo artist. It is a beautifully done song that has so much depth and meaning, it truly reaches out and touches the listener, like much of his music. This song is classic, its hauntingly beautiful and this single is worth the price alone just to have the remixes, get it this is a milestone in his career.

Always Be My Baby will always be one of my favorite Mariah Carey songs. It's such a positive song about breaking up, and not giving up on the fact that the person will be back if they truly were meant to be. The remixes are pretty good too, although I didn't care for the Reggae mix. If you want one of the best remixes of this song, try and find the import of this single with the Morales Mix, it is the bomb!

Christina Aguilera's debut is a great, respectable debut. She has a very powerful voice. The best songs on here include Genie in a Bottle, Reflection, What A Girl Wants, and the best album track I Turn To You, those songs showcase her vocal ability at its best. The problem with this album is, after about the 6th track the album loses its dazzle. Its not Christina, but they were not giving her songs that suited her voice the best. Another good track is Blessed. I suggest you try this out, way better than Britney Spears, she has a voice, they just need to give her better songs that will bring out her vocal talent, like in I Turn To You.

Mindy McCready was plagued with problems with her record label, after they couldn't mutually agree on decisions regarding her third album IM NOT SO TOUGH. She signed with Capitol after leaving BNA, and this was the result of that partnership. This album took a while to make, and was pushed back after many times. The first single &quot;Scream&quot; failed to make an impact on radio, which is a shame, its a torch ballad about all the pain and pent up anger being released. The second single &quot;Maybe, Maybe Not&quot; is a playful song where Mindy considers rekindling an old flame. &quot;Maybe, Maybe not&quot; and &quot;Be With Me&quot; were songs that were recorded after the album was already done. &quot;Maybe, Maybe Not&quot; is a nice song but it doesn't fit the flow of this album, the same can be said for &quot;I Just Want Love&quot; (although an excellent song), and her cover of Chely Wright's &quot;The Fire&quot;. Two songs were left out, the two ballads &quot;Why We Love&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, its a shame those are great ballads. Other highlights include the power ballad &quot;Tremble&quot;, where she shows her vocal training payed off, its a surefire hit. &quot;If I Feel Your Hand&quot; is a beautiful song about wanting to rekindle an old love, but being afraid at the same time. &quot;Lovin Your Man&quot; tells the relationship of cheating from the side of the cheater, and how she regrets what she is doing to her friend, but how she can't help it. Very powerful stuff. Overall MINDY MCCREADY is a great album to listen to, and worth the wait, so give it a try!

Paula's sophmore effort Spellbound has some really catchy songs on here that will stay in your head all day long and keep you dancing. Those songs Im talking about, are like The Promise Of A New Day, Spellbound, Vibeology, etc. Spellbound showed some growth with Paula as an artist, and showed some really good music, however not all songs are stellar. The best songs on the album include Promise of A New Day, Rush Rush, Spellbound, Vibeology, and Will You Marry Me. The other songs are nice but pale in comparsion to these ones. This is a nice album to have, I reccomend it.

Most people find Marilyn Manson appauling. The way he looks, the words he sings in his music, everything about him. Behind everything there is the music, and most people seem to judge him just for how he looks or what he is saying. But if you really to what he is saying, behind all the controversy, he is making valid points and opening our minds to various issues. That is what the shock effect is. An example of his best work is this album, Mechanical Animals.This time around, he went for a more futurstic, dare I say, techno sound with some bleeps and rhythms, not to say the music isnt hard anymore, because he sure can rock the house down with this music. Each of the songs on this album are very good, his approach to lyrics makes us think, and its not just a bunch of jitter, its serious material.I reccomend this cd to anyone who appreciates true music with deals with mature subject matter. Behind everything is this message which needs to be heard. Let Manson open your mind.

Im Not So Tough is a wonderful album. Even though the image wasn't what Mindy wanted, all BNA's doing, which lead to their breakup, the song selection here is very good for Mindy and her voice. The album was very poorly promoted, with only one single released (not even a video), so fans felt like Mindy was not getting the attention she deserved. Each song on here is a gem, like the title track Im Not So Tough (single worthy), Thunder And Roses, the first single (and only single) All I Want Is Everything. Two Different Things is a nice song, could of been a single. Tumble and Roll is another great song which has a nice hook. However I believe the stand out on the album is one of Mindy's best songs ever, a beautiful ballad titled Over And Over. Lucky Me and Take Me Apart are fun sassy songs you could come to expect from Mindy. Overall this whole album is just fun to listen and sing along with, its a shame Mindy gets such a bad rap and her music doesn't get promoted, because she has so much talent. Maybe now that she is with Capitol Nashville, her next album Scream to be released in March 2001, will do much much better and she will get the attention she deserves.

Rascal Flatts is the latest addition to Disney's country music label, Lyric Street, and they are spectacular. They have had some success with their first two singles, Prayin' For Daylight and This Everyday Love, and its no surprise. The three guys that make up Rascal Flatts are Gary Levox, Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney. They are a welcome addition to country music, they have some very good harmonies, some of the best I've heard in a while. Give this album a try, these guys are talented and you will agree after you hear this album.

..heard such a good album by a pop singer. Jessica leads the pack of teen pop singers with her current album, Irresistable. The tracks are more uptempo and contemporary R&amp;B sounding. There are the signature ballads we come to expect from Jessica. It's everything you would want in a Jessica Simpson album and more. It's even better than her past album Sweet Kisses. This is a more mature Jessica, and she's switched it up a bit. The upbeat tracks are great, especially the title track (which is far better than that awful remix on the radio with Lil Bow Wow), Hot Like Fire, I Never and What's It Gonna Be. The ballads are beautiful, especially To Fall In Love Again, For Your Love and There You Were (with Marc Anthony). The final track is the gospel tinged His Eye Is On The Sparrow. Overall this is a great album by a very talented girl, Jessica Simpson. It's addictive to listen to and a fun album overall.

This is Whitney's follow up to the multi platinum album MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE from 1998, which I believe to be her strongest effort. Sadly JUST WHITNEY does not live up to its hype and is nowhere near as good as MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE. However it's not all that bad. Whitney has learned to restrain her vocals, which is nice. There are some great tracks here, such as the bouncy soulful first single &quot;One Of Those Days&quot;, which rightfully should be a hit single. &quot;Love That Man&quot; has a nice vibe and sound to it, and &quot;Things You Say&quot; is a very soulful track, definately an album highlight. &quot;Dear John Letter&quot; is uptempo R&amp;B at its best, and she manages a well cover of the classic &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;. &quot;Try It On My Own&quot; is also a nice Babyface ballad. The songs though come across as a little contrived and forced, alluding to her recent situations in her personal and public life. &quot;Unashamed&quot; claims she is not ashamed of who she is or the choices she makes, whereas on &quot;Tell Me No&quot; and &quot;Whatchulookinat&quot; she dogs out the media for their scrutiny. And while &quot;Try It On My Own&quot; is a nice arrangement and ballad, it comes across a little needy with its half hearted forgiveness, alluding to the mistakes in her life and how she needs to make a positive change on her own. Nice sentiments but its a little heavy, especially on tracks like &quot;Tell Me No&quot;. And then there is the most useless duet with hubby Bobby Brown on &quot;My Love&quot;. Overall its a mixed effort with mixed results, yet it works on some levels, others it doesn't.

Jo Dee Messina's self titled debut album sets the stage for an enigmatic performer, and the promise of good things to come in the future. The big hit single was &quot;Heads Carolina, Tails California&quot;, arguably her best single to date. It also turned out hits like the uptempo &quot;You're Not In Kansas Anymore&quot;, &quot;Do You Wanna Make Something Of It&quot; and the tender beautiful ballad &quot;He'd Never Seen Julie Cry&quot;. There is other great moments on the album, such as two ballads which highlight the set, titled &quot;Let It Go&quot; and &quot;I Didn't Have To Leave You&quot;. She has attitude and spunk to spare, and personality, which comes out in her music. Her next album I'M ALRIGHT even bettered this one, but this one is a good jumping point for a newcomer, and well worth checking out.

Mary was in my opinion the best release of 99, even better than TLC's FanMail which was one of my favorites of the year. Mary shines on this project, vocally, and in her song selection. She wanted to create an album which gave you a good feeling, like when you listened to Stevie Wonder's Songs From The Key Of Life. She did just that, and created a sound like 70's R&amp;B/early 80's R&amp;B.Standouts on the album include the lead off single written by Lauryn Hill, All That I Can Say. Deep Inside is a song about the media and people who want to be a part of her life, just because they want to take advantage of her fame. Beautiful Ones is Mary's favorite track, where the beautiful one is you. Her cover of the 1979 Gap Band hit I'm In Love is a very beautiful song. Time samples Stevie Wonder's Pastime Paradise, and the result is wonderful. Memories is a nice track with an addictive beat. Dont Waste Your Time showcases the vocal gymnastics performed by Mary and Aretha Franklin. Your Child, a standout on the album, deals with the father of a child from another relationship who denies his right as the father, and the pain it causes. The Love I Never Had is one of my definite favorites, it showcases even more pain than her hit Not Gon Cry, and she sings just wonderfully. Give Me You was the third single from this album and it is a really beautiful ballad. The album closes with a disco ditty which mary shines on called Let No Man Put Asunder.Overall this is an awesome album. Anyone who appreciates good music would love this album, it is such a nice retrospective of the 70's soul. A must get.

Mary is Mary J Blige's 6th album, one of her best indeed. The album has a 70's R&amp;B flavor throughout all the songs, and more and more she is proving why she is soulful. She sings with passion, emotion, you can hear her joy or pain in the songs. Here's my track by track review.The album starts off with All That I Can Say, the first single, also written by Lauryn Hill. It continues with songs like Sexy, and Deep Inside which samples an Elton John song and explains the difficulty of being famous and finding someone to trust. Beautiful Ones is Mary's favorite track on the album, deserving of being a single. The next songs include I'm In Love, Time and Memories, which I wouldn't be surprised if it became a single, its one of the best songs on the album. Don't Waste Your Time is a wonderful song with another lady of soul, Aretha Franklin. The vocal gymnastics they perform will leave you breahtless. Your Child, will be the next single (check out the junior vasquez mix!), a song that deals with the pain of realizing the man she's with had a child with another woman, but is neglecting it, and she's trying to deal with it. The tracks continue, suddenly its Give Me You the current single, a wonderful lush ballad. The album closes with a wonderful cover, Let No Man Put Asunder.You should check out this album, if you love mary, or R&amp;B.

Read My Mind is the best Reba album, EVER! Every song on here is the cut, there is not one song on here that is out of place or not as good, they are all awesome.It starts off with the jazzy Everything You Need, then to the title track Read My Mind which happens to be one of her best songs ever. The album tackles many issues, as McEntire's albums usually do. She Thinks His Name Was John is one of the most powerful songs sung by her, a song adressing AIDS and its impact on those who lose their loved ones to the disease. Other powerful songs include I Wish That I Could Tell You, And Still and others. The album closes with another great song by Reba, Til You Love Me. Beautiful arrangements and vocals make this album, her best!

This is not your average country album, in fact there is little to be seen. I don't see why that's a bad thing though, Faith has chosen some really exciting material that suits her voice and is worth talking about. A lot of people judge the album by its cover, with its sexy pictures of Faith wet, even going as far to compare her to Britney Spears. Faith as Britney Spears? At least she has her clothes on and CAN SING. That being said, this is a bold move from Faith, she could lose fans for sure but she could also gain some fans. CRY has a strong rock presence, along with R&B, pop and more. It's rooted in gospel music, which Faith grew up listening to. This was a gradual formation I believe, and now she has found her voice. There's no fluffy songs like This Kiss or The Way You Love Me, just powerful songs that are evokful and full of meaning, and emotion. Highlights include the bouncy Free, the sorrowful ballad Cry, the upbeat and inspiring I Think I Will, Baby You Belong, Unsaveable, When The Lights Go Down, You're Still Here, Stronger and more. Give this a listen, open your mind!

Lets face it, there are not many female country duos in country music. There was The Judds, there are other ones such as the Kinleys, but really there are not many country female duos out there. This is where Regina Regina comes in, a group composed of Regina Leigh and Regina Cook, two former background singers for Reba McEntire.Their debut album showcases the ability of these two talented vocalists to use their voices and work together to create a remarkable sound country music was missing. However, this was in early 1997 and country radio didn't pick up on this hidden talent, which is a shame. I would love to hear more from these ladies.Some highlights on the album include their debut single More Than I Wanted To Know, a fun song about falling in love. Asking For The Moon is a beautiful ballad. A Far Cry From Him is a really nice ballad as well. Right Plan Wrong Man is a fun country song about a plan gone bad. The album closes with a beautiful ballad called She'll Let That Telephone Ring.If you have not heard of this talented duo I suggest you give this cd a try, you will be surprised. The harmonies are beautiful, as their voices intertwine together to create beautiful music for the ears. Too bad they weren't around that long, they are talented, but maybe sometime soon they will come back. When they do I'll be sure to get that cd!

After the release of this album in July 1997, there was no denying after its release that Kenny would go far. This album contains some of his biggest hits. She's Got It All, the first single, shot to #1 which is no surprise, its a great fun summer time song. On You Win, I Win, We Lose its a nice ballad about a couple agreeing to compromise and not to fight over whos right. She Gets That Way is a nice track as well. I Will Stand is a beautiful ballad, which deserved to be a single. That's Why Im Here is the emotional ballad that was released and succeeded on country radio, about a man with a drinking problem. Steamy Windows is a cover of the Tina Turner classic. From Hillbilly Heaven to Honky Tonk Hell is a duet with Tracy Lawrence and George Jones. Other mentionable tracks include the ballad A Chance which was a mild country radio hit, and the acoustic version of his popular ballad When I Close My Eyes. This is a must have for any country fan, you wont know what your missing out on til you hear it!

What is really sad about this album is it failed to garner any attention really, and it is Kylie at her best. As a songwriter she is in top form on this album, and the music is very unique. Kylie hooked up with Manic Street Preachers, to give this album a dance kind of underground feel to it. This album was mostly forgotten, even Kylie never mentions it, which is a shame because artistically she has never been this good. The album opens with the eerie &quot;Too Far&quot;, perfect setting for the album. The album did spawn some hits, like &quot;Did It Again&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;. My favorite tracks are &quot;I Don't Need Anyone&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot;. Other highlights include &quot;Drunk&quot;, &quot;Say Hey&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;, and &quot;Jump&quot;. The whole album is stellar and don't miss this one, its truly her best work yet, so underrated.

Remember Veruca Salt? She was the brat in CHARLIE &amp; THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY who was sent down the bad egg chute, screaming, &quot;I want the whole world, and I want it NOW!!!&quot; This time, Veruca is back in the form of a band (in the shape of a cuddly media package) and armed with one of the most hyped records of 1994. As a result, the single &quot;Seether,&quot;from their debut album, AMERICAN THIGHS, charted on Billboard and received national airplay before anyone could buy it.With hooks as gleaming as the stars shooting off of Wonder Woman's teeth, Veruca Salt powers past Breeders comparisons which are on track, but only halfway there. Instead of the Breeders' surf rock noodling, Veruca Salt dish up straight ahead riffs and meatier, more thought-out solos. Their songs seem a tad more focused, even mean. With lyrics about killing people, and bubbling withrage befitting of Roald Dahl's covetous brat, AMERICAN THIGHS sounds more like the bully compared to the Breeders' pothead road trip, chock full of tongue-in-cheek wordplay. &quot;Number One Blind&quot; praises the virtues of Levelor blinds, &quot;Levelor, which of us is blind?/Levelor left me in the dark.&quot; And when they sing about &quot;Spiderman,&quot; we relive their comic book childhood right along with them.AMERICAN THIGHS shows a band with obvious potential, one with an impressive grasp of a rock guitar dynamic which does not cloud their freshness or their indie rock charm.

Honey I Do is a great upbeat country song by the underrated Danni Leigh, who was on the Monument album with this single but was let go, and as a result they released her A SHOT OF WHISKEY AND A PRAYER album. Honey I Do is a song about loving devotion, and the pain suffered when apart from that loved one. The other song on here is also from the album, called "Longnecks Cigarettes", another great song. You will want to buy this single if you are interested to hear what the album is like, but you can't lose with the album so thats worth looking into also. Give this a try, she's fresh new talent and has a beautiful voice, and I think she will be around for a while regardless of how she does with radio.

Metallica's aptly-named producer Bob Rock is behind the board for Veruca Salt's highly-anticipated follow-up to the gold debut AMERICAN THIGHS, and the difference shows. The twin-guitar attack is thicker and heavier, the drum sound harder and more in-your-face. Overall, the band's approach on EIGHT ARMS is more focused and aggressive. Despite poppy diversions like the effervescent &quot;The Morning Sad&quot; and the almost-ballad &quot;Loneliness Is Worse,&quot; there's a grunge-derived mudslide of sound that powers this album.Whether the lack of dynamic/sonic range from tune to tune is consistency or flaw probably depends on which side of the Veruca Salt fence you stand on to begin with. Singer-guitarists Nina Gordon and Louise Post show themselves to be several steps above their post-grunge peers in the songwriting department. The songs here are well-structured, highly melodic and not without humor (see &quot;With David Bowie&quot;), a commodity far too precious in the alt-rock world. &quot;Volcano Girls&quot; is an obvious standout, full of attitude and a killer baseline. This is a great cd!

Whoever said this should be off the shelf, was right on the money. This crud should not even be on the shelf at all! TWISTED ANGEL is a blatant attempt at selling out and selling more records. When will LeAnn learn? The album is a hybrid of pop, rock, R&B, and a bit more. She can't seem to decide if she's country or not, even though she swears up and down she is not country anymore, yet they release a country version of "Life Goes On" to country radio. She's done with country radio, they won't play her stuff, and that song flopped majorly. On a positive note she sounds good vocally, but the material is not matching of her skills. There's the commerical R&B attempt with "Trouble With Goodbye", the worst song on the album a blatant attempt at a sex song which is laughable, "Tic Toc", and a few other duds. The only saving grace is two ballads, "Safest Place" and "You Made Me Find Myself". It's hard to see what she is trying to accomplish here, but it's definately not working. Be wary of this purchase.

Barbra Streisand's newest Christmas album CHRISTMAS MEMORIES is a must have. Never has she sounded this good. The production is top notch. Her voice is pristine and focused on the material. She has chosen some truly memorable music that fans of Streisand are sure to love. She sings many classics such as &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot;, &quot;It Must Have Been The Mistletoe&quot;, &quot;What Are You Doing New Years Eve&quot; and more. As well we have new songs that are bound to become classics, like &quot;Closer&quot;, a beautiful song about missing someone who is not with you at Christmas. Her rendition of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is nothing short of amazing&quot;, and the closing &quot;One God&quot; is another beautiful track. Barbra truly shines on this album, so get this album, sit by the fire with some popcorn and wine, and just enjoy the beauty of this music as it fills your heart with Christmas joy.

Pay it Forward is a very touching, heartfelt movie you will love. Trevor a young man, is given a social studies project from teacher Eugene, who is rather socially awkward, about changing the world. Trevor gets an idea to do three people a favor, then those three people have to do three other people a favor, and so on. He tries to hook up his mom and his teacher, but finds he has failed himself. However he is surprised to learn his idea is becoming a universal idea that is sweeping the nation. Without giving away the ending, this movie has a lot of surprise plot twists, but it is excellent. The movie inspires the viewer to make a difference, and to not take life for granted. The movie tackles various issues, and does it very well. Rent this movie, buy it, you wont regret it. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osmont have handed in a Emmy worthy performance here with a movie that will be a favorite of yours forever, with its touching tale of family, friends and making the world a better place.

Shelby Lynne once again moves into new territory with her newest album LOVE SHELBY. Her last album I AM SHELBY LYNNE garnered a lot of attention, which it rightfully deserves. People are quick to compare, which is fair, but this album stands on its own as it is a complete different musical direction for Shelby. This time working with Glen Ballard (Alanis Morrissette). Shelby co-wrote most of the album, as well wrote some songs by herself. The music is very americana like, in songs like &quot;Jesus on a Greyhound&quot;. &quot;Trust Me&quot;, and &quot;Bend&quot; are surefire hits if released to radio. &quot;Wall In Your Heart&quot; is a beautiful midtempo song. &quot;I Can't Wait&quot; tells the story of someone longing for love. &quot;Mother&quot; is a cover of the John Lennon song. Its overall a great album and everyone should give it a listen, youll be pleasantly surprised!

Celine Dion returns with a new album after the lackluster response to 2002's A NEW DAY HAS COME. The result is ONE HEART, an upbeat and positive album, and a welcome addition to her fans. It opens with the current hit single &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, her rendition is upbeat and fun, she sounds great vocally. On ONE HEART she enlists the help of Rami and Max Martin, who primarily have worked with Britney Spears, and they contribute three tracks: &quot;Love Is All We Need&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;In His Touch&quot;. &quot;Love Is All We Need&quot; really does sound like a Britney song, and make take time for Celine fans to get into this new vocal style Celine takes on this track. &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;In His Touch&quot; are nice midtempo ballads. The title track is a piece of pop heaven. My favorite track is the light rock sounding &quot;Naked&quot;, which is very catchy and should be a single. One song I didn't particularily care for was &quot;Reveal&quot;, I could have done without this one on the album. &quot;Have You Never Been In Love&quot; and &quot;Sorry For Love&quot; make a return appearance on this album, originally from A NEW DAY HAS COME, however it should be said the latter is a different version. Another recycled song is &quot;Coulda Woulda Shoulda&quot;, which was on the special edition of A NEW DAY HAS COME, but I think it belongs on this album, its very upbeat and probably my second favorite song on the album. The other two recycled songs though, I could have done without. Nevertheless, there's three ballads which end the CD, my favorite being &quot;I Know What Love Is&quot;, which has hit written all over it. Overall ONE HEART is a pleasant surprise, nice to see Celine trying new things with her music. The album carries a theme of hope, faith, happiness, and overall just positive.

Toni's fourth album MORE THAN A WOMAN is much different than her past albums. Giving up on the Diane Warren ballads, she opts on this record to present a more upbeat sound and succeeds well. The album opens with the uptempo "Let Me Show You The Way (Out)" which is a good track to open the album with. Onto "Give Me Back", which features The Big Tymers, would be an excellent single choice. However, they are promoting this album all wrong and releasing the weaker tracks. Such as "A Better Man" which is slated to be the second single, and the album's first single "Hit The Freeway" (featuring Loon), are among the albums weaker tracks. There was much more potential than these two singles, so hopefully we will get some good singles released from this album. "Lies Lies Lies" is tinged with rock and soul, and "Rock Me, Roll Me" is a sexy song only Toni could sing. "Selfish" is a nice jazzy type song, works well with Toni's voice. Other highlights here include the ballad "Always", the uptempo "Do You Remember When" and "Tell Me". Overall this was a step in the right direction, Toni sounds good and has handed in another great performance and good CD.

Heartbreaker was yet another venture into pop music, as well as disco, adult contemporary and country, for Dolly Parton. This album offers many sounds for the listener, and includes some of her nicest songs. The hits include Baby Im Burnin and Heartbreaker, both timeless, but the other songs are just as timeless (even today), with some classic ballads like Were Through Forever Til Tommorow, Its Too Late To Love Me Now and Ive Really Got The Feeling, while singing fun songs like With You Gone, Sure Thing, I Wanna Fall In Love. I reccomend this to fans of Dolly, although the country fans of Dolly might find this one disapointing.

If you havent seen this movie, you are missing out. Beaches is perhaps the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It follows the friendship between two women, ever since they met on a beach when they were young girls, and into their womanhood. It focuses on the triumps and the challenges that people face in their friendships. The movie is touching, I dont want to give the plot away to those who havent seen it, but it is a very touching story about a friendship. This movie will make you laugh, cry and so much more. I reccomend this movie to everyone, it will make you realize how precious time is and why it is a gift, and the value of true friendship.

Legendary is the best Dolly compilation of her hits, offering fans 50 of her best known hits. After dozens of greatest hits compilations, there is finally one that we can call complete, or close to. Its a must have, in its 3 discs you get a variety of hits, such as the original version of Two Doors Down, which is a find, and other well known hits that made this career. This is the best collection you will find for Dolly Parton out there, and for this low price you will not want to pass up.

On this 1987 recording, Emmylou Harris focuses on country ballads with a Christian bent. Many traditional songs arranged by Harrisare heard here, including &quot;If I Be Lifted Up,&quot; &quot;Bright Morning Stars,&quot; &quot;We Shall Rise,&quot; &quot;Drifting Too Far,&quot; and the title track, &quot;Angel Band.&quot; Songs by Paul Kennerly and Ralph and Carter Stanley are also featured.Lyrically, the songs on ANGEL BAND revolve around the pursuit of redemption, forgiveness, and joy in a world of heartbreak and loss. Musically, the group, consisting of country greats Vince Gill, Jerry Douglas, and Mark O'Connor among others, is sensitive, subtle and melodically compelling. Thehighlight of the album is the uplifting &quot;When They Ring Those Golden Bells,&quot; which features fine instrumental work in addition to Harris's beautiful vocal performance.

Lovesexy is perhaps Prince's greatest cd ever. In this album, he takes the listener on a spiritual journey with God and sex, without sounding condescending or preaching. The listening experience is smooth and funky. There are nine tracks on the album, but Prince put them all into one track (that lasts 45 minutes with all 9 songs) because he didn't want people to skip tracks while he was listening, but rather hear the album as a whole. I don't mind that at all, its great to listen to the album the whole way through.Highlights on the album include Alphabet St., a funky little number that will keep you singing and dancing. Dance On, which will have you doing just what the title implies. Lovesexy which is perhaps my fave track, beautiful song. When 2 R In Love which is a classic Prince ballad. And more.This is a must have for any fan of music. Lovesexy takes you on a musical journey through God and sex, and does it very well. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard, it is often overlooked by critics but it is one of his best, most solid albums ever.

I remember this album well. When I was growing up, my parents would drive me up to our cottage and we would play this cassette in the car. I remember that I fell in love with Kenny's voice and these songs were so powerful to me, even at the young age of six or seven I felt inspired by this music. It is truly my favorite Kenny Rogers album, even though it is not his usual country style music. 12 years later I have come back to this album, and I smile when I remember those days of listening to the cassette of this very album. The title track &quot;Something Inside So Strong&quot; is a very empowering inspirational theme, it puts a lump in your throat. The duet with Anne Murray, &quot;If I Ever Fall In Love Again&quot;, is a beautiful ballad which deserved more recognition that it got. &quot;When You Put Your Heart In It&quot; is a beautiful inspirational song. Other mentionable songs include If I Knew Then What I Know Now, the duet with Gladys Knight, There Lies The Difference, and Planet Texas. Although the whole album is completely enjoyable. I highly reccomend this album, its the perfect album for any mood you are in.

Another Greatest Hits Collection, the first in this volume, contains many of Celine's hits like Tell Him, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, Seduces Me, Falling Into You, The Reason, That's The Way It is and many more. The highlight is the song The Power of the Dream, a song Celine sang at the 1996 Olympic games. Overall a nice collection but it could have been better.

janet. REMIXED is a great album that contains remixes from her hits from the janet. album, as well as bsides which didnt make the album cut. Among the best remixes include You Want This, If, That's The Way Love Goes, Anytime Anyplace, Where Are You Now, pretty much every remix. The only one I didn't enjoy was the Because of Love remix, but its still nice. The bsides are great too, And On And On is a great summer song, 70's Love Groove is a great song about making love. I wish the CD included the great bside One More Chance, its on the If Single if you can find that. Overall this album is a must for fans of Janet!

This is an awesome cd. Every single song of the 12 songs is great. She shines on both ballads and uptempo songs. Now That I Found You is a wonderful ballad, Everytime I Cry is a touchy song about domestic abuse. I'm Alright is a kinda good feeling song. Till I Get There is a wonderful song. This Ole Heart is a nice upbeat song with a good chorus line. Unsung Hero is a great cover of the Tina Arena song. This cd is worth getting, trust me.

The Bside Let Down Your Guard is marvelous. Its the most R&amp;B flavored Madonna song. I wish it made the album, but clearly they didn't think it should be on the album. Lots of people hated it but Ive grown to like it quite a bit. A nice single for fans to have.

GREATEST HITS takes a retrospect of Martina's almost 10 year career. Starting with her first hit My Baby Loves Me, all the way to last year's hit There You Are, from her EMOTION album. Also included is the non hit Strangers, which is a hit in its own right. What's spectacular are the new songs included in this collection. Blessed is a nice positive, start your day with a smile song. When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues is a hit already, its a fun song for the ladies with a lot of attitude and sassiness. Where Would You Be is one of my favorite songs (along with Concrete Angel), its a powerful ballad about being in a relationship and not knowing how the other person feels, if he doubting or what not. Very powerful song with vocals that will blow you away. Concrete Angel is another &quot;issue&quot; song like Independance Day or Love's The Only House (both on this CD by the way), this time dealing with child abuse. Very heartbreaking, but it offers a glimmer of hope in reference to the line &quot;but her dreams give her wings, and she flies to a place where she's loved&quot;. This is the standout in my opinion, very sad and heartbreaking, it'll make you cry. The CD also features liner notes from Martina and co producer Paul Worley, who offer insight on all the songs. Overall a good buy and a must have!

As A Mary J Blige fan, I bought this expecting to get some of her music videos, as they are not readily available and hard to find. So I bought this, very disapointed. Besides that there are only clips of her videos, they also advertise a lot of videos on the box which are not included, plus during the videos there is that annoying MAKE IT OR BREAK IT text covering the video, which is annoying. Dont waste your money, luckily i got mine back.

Music is Madonna latest album, and she is still pushing the boundaries of music and making way for artists to follow. The album has a very french techno sound, thanks to her fellow collaborator Mirwais, a french DJ. The album is more happier than 1998's Ray of Light, a little more upbeat. The title track lead off single is a fun song with addictive lyrics and a song that will keep you dancing. There are other great dance tracks on here, like the song Impressive Instant which has a killer baseline and dance beat. Runaway Lover is bound to be a single, its one of the more upbeat songs on the album, a very fun airy dance track. I Deserve It, is the first in reflective tracks. She reflects on her career, stating everything was worth it. Amazing is an ok song, probably my least favorite. Not very original, it sounds almost exactly like 99's Beautiful Stranger. Nobody's Perfect is another song where Madonna reacts to the media critiquing her for everything, she is not perfect. Her voice has been transformed a bit on this one, but its nice. Dont Tell Me is a wonderful addictive acoustic type track which has an R&amp;B type flavor. What It Feels Like For A Girl is a song which would be an anthem for young females everywhere, coping with the way girls are treated. Paradise (Not For Me) is also on Mirwais album, a little strange but a nice song overall. Gone closes the album, a very acoustic track which is a nice closer for the album, a highlight. Mirwais contributed mostly to this album, but Orbit still did a few songs. Its a good album, not as spectacular in my opinion as Ray Of Light. Its fun to listen to, but wears off a little after a while. Up there with her best works such as Ray of Light, Erotica and Bedtime Stories. Go and get it!

Final Fantasy XI is my favorite game in the FF collection on Playstation. It's easy to play, addictive and fun, interesting, and so much more! The characters you really get to know well, using all of them at different points in the game for different tasks. The Equip mode is much easier to understand and use than the one in FF8. The story is fun, dramatic, comedic, and more. The game has replay value, so you will want to play it more than once. The Chocobo Mini Game is a lot of fun to do, you'll actually want to do this one. The graphics and CG's are spectacular. I do not have one complaint about this game. It is one of the best RPG's I've played in a long time. Square once again proved with this game that they make the best RPG's. This is a must have for RPG fans.

Monica's 1998 sophomore album THE BOY IS MINE does not disapoint. Starting with the fresh sound on &quot;Street Symphony&quot;, definatley my favorite track here, it sets the mood and pace for the album. Next is the hit single, &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, with Brandy, a tale of two lovers torn by the cheating man. &quot;The First Night&quot; is another funky song, sure to impress. She handles a cover of &quot;Misty Blue&quot; gracefully! &quot;Angel of Mine&quot; is the best ballad here, Monica sounds comfortable with this song as she slides through it gracefully. &quot;Inside&quot; is a nice touch too. The duet with 112 is another welcome addition on &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;. Overall there is a nice mixture of R&amp;B, with hints of hip hop, and some compelling ballads here, making for a great album. Check it out!

Gary Allan returned in October 2001 with ALRIGHT GUY, the follow up to his hugely successful SMOKE RINGS IN THE DARK album. ALRIGHT GUY is country at its finest, its loud its twangy, its real man country in terms of the material. It's not trying to be anything it's just what it is, not trying to tone the content down at all. The album opens with "Man To Man" where a man confronts his lover's ex boyfriend. "The Devil's Candy" is pretty darn catchy and would serve well as a single. "Man of Me" was the album's first single, straight country pure and simple. "Adobe Walls" is classic country with a ballroom type feel to it. "The One" is a beautiful song which has been a huge hit for Gary. Other highlights include "I Don't Look Back", "I'm Doin My Best", "Alright Guy" and "What's On My mind", oh and check out "What Would Willie Do". Overall another great album from a talented guy.

A lot are quick to judge this cd, but I bought this on a whim (plus being a fan of No Doubt helped out) and I can honestly say I am not at all disapointed. ROCK STEADY is a breath of fresh air. The band is evolving and trying new things, and this CD is a result of the good mood they were in during the RETURN OF SATURN tour. They wanted us to dance, well I'm dancing so they succeeded. My favorite song would either be the Prince produced &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, which to put it mildly, is hot. I also like &quot;Running&quot; quite a bit, which in my opinion is Gwen's most vocally endearing song to date. &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Making It Out&quot; and &quot;Underneath it All&quot; are also great songs. The CD is a mixture of punk and ska, with electonic beats with the help of producers by the likes of William Orbit, Prince, Nellee Hooper, and more. Overall its a worthwhile buy. Give this one a listen!

Cher has made her huge comeback, this was back in 1998 when Believe hit the airwaves, and soon everyone knew what song that was. Following suit to Madonna, Gloria Estefan and others who all had dance albums out that year before Cher, she has created one which is alike yet very original and unique. Believe is a club experience. There is some strong material here, key tracks including Runaway, We All Sleep Alone and All Or Nothing, which is the standout of the album. Other songs are good, but some are more bside like such as The Power or Taxi Taxi, which sounded like they were better suited as bsides to the singles of the album. Nevertheless this is a nice album, but by far not her best album.

Poetic Justice is a movie about a girl named Justice who has trouble finding herself and her place in the world after the death of a close one. She works at a salon and encounters a young man (played to Tupac Shakur) and sparks fly between them at first, but after a road trip they find love. Its a long movie and often can lose attention, but Janet is truly showing her ability to act. Its not the best but she shows a lot of potential, its a much better movie than her current movie role (which was also good) in the Nutty Proffessor II: Klumps. Give this movie a try, youll be surprised.

The GLITTER soundtrack features eleven all-new recordings from Mariah Carey, undeniably the most successful female singer of the 1990s. With this collection, Mariah pushes the creative envelope further than she ever has before, highlighting her incredible versatility and depth, not to mention her amazing vocal range. Fans of Carey's earlier work (remember Vision of Love, Love Takes Time, anyone?) will be pleased to hear some signature ballads from Mariah that bring us back to those early days in career, on the sweeping ballads &quot;Lead The Way&quot; and &quot;Never Too Far&quot; which showcase her amazing voice in a nice arrangement. The soundtrack sets the mood for the movie, this being in the 80's, so it's only fitting to have &quot;80s sounding songs&quot;, take for example &quot;Didn't Mean To Turn You On&quot;, &quot;Want You&quot; (with Eric Benet), or &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&quot;, are all excellent songs that represent the 80's spirit well. In BUTTERFLY we slowly saw her moving into R&amp;B, then on RAINBOW she was going hip hop, and she continues the trend on GLITTER. Lots of guest artists here such as Mystikal on &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, Ludacris, Da Brat, Cameo, Twenty II, Shawnna on &quot;Loverboy&quot; (Remix), Ja Rule and Nate Dogg on &quot;If We&quot;, Busta Rhymes and Fabulous on &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, DJ Clue on &quot;Don't Stop&quot; and &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&quot; and many others. Overall this is one of her best albums yet, with lots of ballads, uptempo, something for all the fans to enjoy.

Alanis has a winner on her hands with SO CALLED CHAOS. The music sounds fresh and different from her other albums, but it still maintains the same honesty that her lyrics have always had. The first single is &quot;Everything&quot;, a different sounding song for Alanis, not a favorite but it's ok. &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; is a great rocking song with a killer chorus. &quot;Excuses&quot; is my favorite on the album, it sounds a bit like &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;. Other highlights on the disc include the title track, &quot;Spineless&quot;, and &quot;Out Is Through&quot;.

Keith Urban is back with a strong set of songs with GOLDEN ROAD. The album opens with the infectuous first single &quot;Somebody Like You&quot;, I dare you to not try and sing along to this truly wonderful song, definately a good song to introduce the album with. &quot;You Look Good In My Shirt&quot; is a surefire hit, with an excellent guitar riff, it's an incredibly catchy song. &quot;Raining on Sunday&quot; is the second single, a wonderful torch song. &quot;What About Me&quot; laments what all of us are thinking, just what the title suggests. &quot;Whenever I Run&quot; is an excellent ballad, about running to the one you love. There is quite a bit of guitar, banjo and fiddle on this album, filled with his wonderful vocals. Other highlights include &quot;Song For Dad&quot;, &quot;You'll Think of Me&quot; and &quot;Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me&quot;. Definately pick up GOLDEN ROAD right away, its an excellent CD!

Coat of Many Colors was a good choice of an album from Dolly's catalogue to rerelease as remastered (lets hope they do some more for other favorites such as New Harvest First Gathering, Great Pretender, Burlap and Satin, etc). This album features some very heartful songs that everyone will love. Songs like Coat Of Many Colors, My Blue Tears, The Mystery of The Mystery, Early Morning Breeze and A Better Place to Live are among the best tracks on this cd. This is a great cd for fans of Dolly and fans of great music.

Come is one of Prince's most underrated albums. I believe it was an album he was obligated to make, to meet his contract with Warner Bros. The album is a very dark, depressing and morbid in a sense. The Prince on the cover is very creepy and disturbing. The music is some of his most compelling work in a long while. The album tackles various issues. Papa is a song about all those father's that abuse their children, Race is about racism, and there's much more. The album is quite explicit. This is not an album you would put on at a party, or even play really loud. Its just a complex album of songs that require the listener to sit with the songs and take them in. Highlights include the funky Loose!, Letitgo, Solo and Pheromone. This album is not for everyone, if you are a casual listener of Prince you may want to borrow this one before you buy it.

In most cases, I dont enjoy sequels to other movies, but in this case, I truly enjoyed this movie, The Evening Star, which is the sequel to 1983's Terms of Endearment. Shirley MacLaine lights up the screen again, playing the role of Aurora Greenway. The movie takes place years after Aurora's daugher has died, and all of the deceased mother's kids have grown up. Growing up hasn't been easy, and the movie focuses on the relationships between family and friends, the good times and the bad times. The movie focuses on rediscovery of life, and finding new purpose for each character. The movie both entertains and tugs at your heart strings with its dramatic plot that will bring tears to your eyes, but also will make you laugh in more comedic scenes. I highly reccomend this movie if you are looking for a movie that touches your soul, and makes you think about life in general, or if you just enjoy good movies, period.

On The 6 by Jennifer Lopez is a respectable debut album. You may have known her previously from movies or even when she was a dancer for Janet Jackson during the janet. era (1993-95). Janet was one of her greatest teachers. This album is good, the songs you hear on the radio are only the beggining. We all know Waiting For Tonight, If You Had My Love, Feelin So Good, etc, but the other songs are WOW. She should of released some of the ballads (like Talk About Us or Should've Never). One complaint: where do you find the video remix version of Waiting For Tonight, it would of been nice to have been included here. I reccomend this cd.

After 3 years, Faith Evans returns with a collection of R&amp;B that will keep every fan satisfied. FAITHFULLY keeps the tempo between midtempo and uptempo. Songs like &quot;Back To Love&quot;, &quot;Burnin Up (feat Loon)&quot;, &quot;Faithfully&quot;, &quot;You Gets No Love&quot; and others will keep you on the dancefloor, and keep you begging for more. Then there are the excellent songs like &quot;Can't Believe (with Carl Thomas&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;, &quot;Where We Stand&quot; etc. This time with the album Faith keeps an upbeat mood, it seems she wants you to dance. The tracks have good production and beats, very original and unlike anything out there right now. This album is another reminder why Faith is one of R&amp;B's leading ladies, she keeps it real and knows how to mix things up each album, without sounding like anyone else. It's a shame she doesn't get any more airplay, because she is awesome.

After long legal battles and speculation, the Dixie Chicks are back with one of their best efforts yet, HOME. The album has a more earthy feel to it, lending its sounds to bluegrass and folk. By now everyone should know the first single "Long Time Gone", an uptempo number that sets a pace for the album. The album continues with their second single, their cover of Stevie Nicks "Landslide", a beautiful song with goregeous vocals and instrumentation, like the rest of the album. HOME features less percussion and more emphasis on instruments and harmony vocals, a wonderful sound. Their rendition of "Travelin Soldier" is nothing short of amazing. They recorded two Patty Griffin songs for this project, "Truth No 2" and "Top of the World", good renditions. Perhaps my favorite track is the title track "A Home" about broken home life and wondering what life would have been like if it was a home, beautiful song. We see more tenderness from the Chicks on "More Love", a midtempo number that relents more love is needed for a relationship to strive, and "I Believe In Love", a beautiful ballad reminiscent of Dolly Parton. Emmylou Harris offers her wonderful harmony vocals on their rendition of Radney Foster's "Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)". For the fans of uptempo fare there's the bluegrass tinged "White Trash Wedding", the instrumental "Lil' Jack Slade" and "Tortured Tangled Hearts". If you're expecting anything like their past music, you won't find it here. There is no "Goodbye Earl", "There's Your Trouble", or "Ready To Run", but the music is wonderful and its good to have the Dixie Chicks back!

I was anticipating this album for a long time, especially after SKIN, which was an amazing outpouring of emotion from Melissa Etheridge. LUCKY follows that emotional outpouring, only this time it's love. &quot;Breathe&quot; is a great song, even though it's a cover, she did a great job and really makes it her own without ruining the original. &quot;This Moment&quot; is going to be a hit I can just feel it, it has hit written all over it. &quot;If You Want To&quot;, &quot;Mercy&quot;, &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, are all great rockin kind of songs. &quot;When You Find The One&quot;, &quot;Meet Me In The Dark&quot;, &quot;Will You Still Love Me&quot;, and many others, are loving ballads. Overall a great album!

Chely Wright's Single White Female's is probably her best album, gearing her towards the more contemporary country crowd with the likes of Faith Hill and Martina McBride. The first single, the title track, is a perfect album opener and first single with a nice hook and just the right amount of attitude and twang in it to make it a success. It Was is a great ballad with some powerful lyrics and words, and She Went Out For Cigarettes is a tragic, yet poignant tale about leaving a bad relationship. Chely revists one of her past songs and redoes it here, titled The Love That We Lost which is one of the strongest songs here. Picket Fences is a nice song about the joys, trials and tribulations of being a mother. Overall there is not a filler track to be found on this marvelous album, I suggest you pick it up and see what talent you've been missing out, the talented Chely Wright

Stepping Stone is Lari White's fourth studio album, her most promising one yet. The songs are fun, and it is pop country but the voice is amazing. Its also amazing, with a voice like that why she isn't big in country. You ask someone about Lari White most would just say who? because she is an underrated singer. If you want good music, you should get this album because the songs tell stories. Go out and get it!

This is a great album. All of the 10 songs are excellent, definately worth the wait for this album. Thinkin About You and XXX's And OOO's (An American Girl) became instant hits for Trisha. The album also contains other great songs like the cover of Melissa Etheridge's You Can Sleep While I Drive, Gretchen Peters On A Bus To St Cloud, and songs like Fairytale, The Restless Kind, and so much more. Definately check this one out!

13 #1's on this collection, 4 new tracks, make a wonderful album. It includes all her #1's Vision of Love, Love Takes Time, Someday, I Dont Wanna Cry, Emotions, Ill Be There, Dreamlover, Hero, Fantasy, One Sweet Day, Always Be My Baby, Honey, My All, and 4 brand new tracks. When You Believe is a wonderful. Whenever You Call is a remake of her 1997 Butterfly album cut, this time a duet with Brian McKnight. I Still Believe is the last new track, a remake of the Brenda K Starr song. Now Mariah has #15 #1's, so within time there will most likely be a #1's volume II, and hopefully that other album she talks about in the liner notes will be released soon. A nice collection for new fans, or old, of Mariah Carey.

Danni Leigh debuted in 1998 with her album 29 NIGHTS, and this was the lead off single. &quot;If The Jukebox Took Teardrops&quot; is a great song, there's no other song on country radio like it at the time (or now even). Very edgy and very traditional in country, but a great song. Its a good song about what would make her world perfect. The song was not accepted by radio but its still a great investment, and check out her album 29 NIGHTS as well, which is nothing less than excellent. Danni will go far, even if country doesn't embrace her differences and her own creativity. Excellent!

Design of a Decade 1986/1996 covers a decade of Janet's hits, from Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. Mostly from Control and Rhythm Nation 1814, since those albums were on A&amp;M as this one is. One song did make the cut from Janet's 1993 album janet. which was on Virgin Records. Many of the songs appear in their original form, some are edited, and some are remixed versions. This is a must have for fans of Janet.

At first I didnt really like this song, but it grew on me (the original) after hearing the wonderful remix done by LA Reid (the one thats in the video). This is a really good remix and it adds flava to the song. I highly reccomend this CD single.

Dream Street is a nice album, very overrated. She was still young but these songs are infectuous. The songs are very poppy and fun oriented, that will make you want to dance. While the album may not show Janet's stronger vocals, it doesnt matter as these songs are what they are, FUN! Songs like Dream Street, Two To The Power Of Love, If It Takes All Night, Pretty Boy, Fast Girls, etc will make you sing, dance and make you want to relive those memories all over again!

This is where it began, the career of Janet Jackson, she was 16 at the time of its release, and who knew that she would acheive so much in her career. While this certainly isnt her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours. Her voice isnt that strong here but its still nice, I mean this is her debut album and she didnt hit it big until Control in 1986, but this is still worth checking out.

Human Nature is a great song. Its one of the more R&amp;B flavored tracks on her Bedtime Stories album. However these remixes are pitiful. It isn't wise to turn a R&amp;B song into a dance remix first of all, she could of made R&amp;B or hip hop type remixes. That would of been good, but these are pitiful. Don't even waste your money on this, just be satisfied with the album version on Bedtime Stories, because thats the best you will hear of this song.

Jo Dee Messina's third effort, Burn, is a nice album full of positive messages and catchy lyrics. At a first listen, I knew it was different. It was tricky getting into it at first, the first single That's The Way did not grab me the way the first single from her last album, Bye Bye, grabbed me. Despite everything, I knew Jo Dee always puts out good albums so I bought it. No disapointments here. The best songs include Downtime, Burn, If Not You, Closer, Angelene, Thats The Way and Bring On The Rain.

At first when I bought this album last August, I was really disapointed. It was nothing like Im Alright and I just didn't like this new image. That was my problem. To enjoy this album, dont compare it to her past albums. Once I really listened to it, it soon became a favorite of mine. The album is just filled with great songs, it was well worth the wait between albums! &quot;Downtime&quot; is such a great song for those of us who have left a relationship, its the perfect theme to give you confidence and to make you feel good about yourself. &quot;That's The Way&quot; is another really positive song, about taking things in stride because everything is just a part of life. &quot;Burn&quot; is a great cover done by Jo Dee, originally by Tina Arena, this really shows Jo Dee's vocal ability, which is amazing. &quot;If Not You&quot; is a surefire hit, really catchy and fun. &quot;These Are The Days&quot; is a great song about not taking for granted our precious time on earth. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is an ode to the gals, a surefire hit, must be a single! &quot;Bring On The Rain&quot; is a great surprise, a very good song with Tim McGraw singing background vocals. Overall, while Burn may not add up to Im Alright, it stands on its own as a solid record filled with some great material that people can relate to, and a whole lot of talent.

This was the fourth in a series of hit albums Linda Ronstadt made in the mid-seventies, starting with HEART LIKE A WHEEL. Like its predecessors, SIMPLE DREAMS is a rich collection of pensive folk ballads, pop with country leanings, and good old rock &amp; roll. Her skill in navigating this rootsy terrain is exemplary, taking her from the swagger of her cover of The Rolling Stones' &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; to the sweet whisperings of the acoustic &quot;MaybeI'm Right.&quot; This record also features some of her most enduringly popular hits, such as &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; and &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me.&quot;The rousing opening track, Buddy Holly's &quot;It's So Easy&quot; featuring her trademark growl, along with &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and the playful &quot;Poor Poor Pititul Me,&quot; give the record moments of electrifying energy. It's the ballads, however, that comprise the majority of the tunes. Included are two traditional songs, &quot;I Never Will Marry&quot; (featuring Dolly Parton) and &quot;Old Paint,&quot; both given simple but lovely arrangements by Ronstadt herself. The melodramatic &quot;Sorrow Lives Here&quot; is almost a hint of what is to come in the form of her collaborations with Nelson Riddle. Her artistry is perhaps best demonstrated in &quot;Blue Bayou;&quot; the shift from the quiet and husky verse to the yearning wail that is the chorus is nothing short of breathtaking.

As the '70s were drawing to a close, Linda Ronstadt began to make some slight alterations to her image and the kind of songs she sang. The cover for 1978's LIVING IN THE U.S.A. showed Ronstadt--who usually wore flowing dresses on roller skates, sporting short shorts and a satin jacket. And while she once again drew upon the work of songwriters whose work she had covered previously (J.D. Souther, Smokey Robinson), she also included songs by such bright stars of the moment as Elvis Costello (a nice reworking of &quot;Allison&quot;) and Warren Zevon (&quot;Mohammed's Radio.&quot;)The biggest hit on the record was the lead track, an energetic version of Chuck Berry's &quot;Back in the U.S.A&quot;, in which Ronstadt continued her tradition of '50s covers (she had already scored big with Buddy Holly, Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison songs). She also enjoyed considerable chart success with Robinson's &quot;Ooh Baby Baby&quot; and her perky version of &quot;Just One Look,&quot; which was, unfortunately, later used as a jingle in a camera commercial.

Since the 1960s, Linda Ronstadt has gone down many different musical paths in her career, but with MAD LOVE it's quite clear she was in a rockin' state of mind. Kicking off with the title track (written by new wave band the Cretones, who back here on this album), Linda shows that rock can also mean pop, as this is as catchy as they come. &quot;Party Girl&quot; is the first of three Elvis Costello covers, and this version should have made Elvis proud. The Blondie-ish hit &quot;How Do I make You&quot; features Nicolette Larson on background vocals.&quot;I Can't Let Go&quot;, shows that a beautiful voice can also be a rock &amp; roll one. &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot; is the sole ballad on the album and is a soulful cover of Little Anthony &amp; The Imperial's hit. The covers continue with an excellent version of Neil Young's &quot;Look Out For My Love.&quot; The album concludes with Elvis Costello's &quot;Girls Talk&quot; and &quot;Talking In The Dark.&quot; Linda had covered Elvis' &quot;Alison&quot; on her LIVING IN THE USA album and continues the tradition here. MAD LOVE is a high energy, rousing record with catchy riffs, fantastic vocals and solid production.

HASTEN DOWN THE WIND was a number three smash and Ronstadt's first million- selling disc. It also garnered her a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It's a very real, raw album with Ronstadt's sweet vocals pierced by a touch of grit. &quot;Lose Again&quot; is a country rock ballad written by Karla Bonoff. Linda decides it's time to rock out with a kickin' version of Buddy Holly's &quot;That'll Be The Day.&quot;Ronstadt delves into Spanish territory with &quot;Lo Siento Mi Vida,&quot; a beautiful acoustic number. The title track is a ballad written by Warren Zevon and features fellow Californian Don Henley on harmony vocals. Ronstadt goes the Jamaican route with &quot;Give One Heart,&quot; a reggae love song. Linda does a powerful and searing rendition of Patsy Cline's &quot;Crazy,&quot; as her soprano sheds new light on an old classic. Ronstadt has explored many musical styles in her career, and HASTEN is no exception, as country, rock, pop, Spanish music and reggae come together to form a winner.

After the chart-topping success of HEART LIKE A WHEEL, Linda Ronstadt released PRISONER IN DISGUISE in 1975, an extremely successful follow-up effort which bolstered her standing as one of America's most popular singers. Opting not to fiddle with a formula that was working, Ronstadt delivered another collection of well-crafted, carefully arranged rock, pop and country songs that showed off her talent for covering good tunes and rendering them in a way that allowed the melodies to soar on the strength of her graceful voice.The album yielded two strong singles: an exuberant version of the Motown classic &quot;Heat Wave&quot; and a silky-smooth rendition of Smokey Robinson's &quot;Ooh Baby Baby,&quot; featuring lyrical alto saxophone touches by veteran session man David Sanborn. Ms. Ronstadt makes great use of the poignant ache in her voice on elegaic ballads like James Taylor's &quot;Hey Mister, That's Me Up on the Jukebox&quot; and Dolly Parton's &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; which she sings with considerably less vocal histrionics than Whitney Houston would in her remake of the tune some 20 years later, which is a good thing.

This major 1973 release finds Ronstadt still solidifying her position as rock's premier interpretive singer. The country rock of the Eagles and producer/writer John David Souther remains the idiom, but Ronstadt has the voice, style and background to deliver this commercialized roots music with little loss of authenticity. Unlike Bonnie Raitt or Janis, she is relatively free of blues or R&amp;B influence. In another singer this might seem a liability, but it allows Rondstadt unusually direct access to the emotional wellsprings of the country and folk which defined post-sixties rock music. Whether on the Eagles' own &quot;Desperado,&quot; the country warhorse &quot;Silver Threads And Golden Needles&quot; or Neil Young's &quot;I Believe In You,&quot; Rondstadt's powerful contralto emerges as a representative voice of a musical generation just coming of age.

Perhaps inspired by the triumphs of TRIO and TRIO II, which they recorded with Dolly Parton, Linda Rondstadt and Emmylou Harris went into a makeshift studio to record an album as a duo. The results are superb. Rondstadt leaves her slick Hollywood pop sound behind and delivers some of her most unadorned and heartfelt singing since the early '70s. Harris is Harris: her voice is as delicate as a butterfly and as strong as steel.The songs on WESTERN WALL are varied, each vividly telling a story. &quot;1917&quot; is a chilling chronicle of an affair cast amid the brutality of WW I. &quot;Sweet Spot&quot; is an eerie declaration of devotion, with a spare, Laurie Anderson-like use of electronics, written by Harris and Luscious Jackson's Jill Cunniff. Rondstadt shines on a straightforward, proud version of Jackson Browne's &quot;For a Dancer.&quot; Other song choices include Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Across the Border&quot; and Leonard Cohen's &quot;Sisters of Mercy.&quot; Excellent.

Sunshine Anderson was quite a surprise for me! Never have I heard such soulful singing in such a long time. There is only one other artist these days who still manages to make great soulful R&amp;B music, and that is Mary J Blige, so it was welcome for another singer to follow suit and create some really memorable music. Your Woman is a collection of soul songs that will keep you singing, and its a great cd to relax with while listening. Never Heard it Before is addictive, you will probably listen to it continuously until you hear the rest of this album. Other highlights include He Said, She Said; Where Have You Been; Letting Down My Guard; Your Woman; Crazy Love and more. Give Sunshine Anderson a try, shes a very talented young lady and you will agree when you hear that voice!

Dolly Parton has had a slew of creative success behind her past few albums, so its no surprise once again she's turned in a commanding performance on HALOS AND HORNS her newest offering. The album opens with the title track, which has excellent harmony vocals. The album has interesting concepts, for one she covers two well known songs: Bread's &quot;If&quot; and Led Zepplin's &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. As well two of her own past hits get retreatment, &quot;What a Heartache&quot; and &quot;Shattered Image&quot;. The remaining 10 songs are all brand new, and some of her most inspired. &quot;Hello God&quot; recalls 9/11 and offers peace, &quot;These Old Bones&quot; has Dolly role playing, &quot;I'm Gone&quot; is a fun quirky leave-your-man kind of song. The album's first single and video is &quot;Dagger Through the Heart&quot;, and Dolly does heartbreak well. Overall HALOS AND HORNS is another winner, so be sure to add it to your collection.

The third single from Music, What It Feels Like For A Girl, is the best track on the album, and terribly underrated. Here is a song Madonna has sung, that encompasses the trials of being a woman, and the fears and all the emotions expressed of what life is like for a girl, and the public has written it off as 'another madonna song'. Never has anyone recorded a song with this emotional intensity regarding such an issue. The fact that the video is &quot;controversial&quot; is rather stupid. The video is marvelous, it should not have been banned. I have seen more violence on television, and its actually quite a comedic video, that makes a staggering point at the same time. This single is essential, it has some of the best remixes fans have been treated to, it is the best maxi single from Music (so far), and the spanish remix is a added bonus. So don't listen to the media hype about this song, just listen to it and you will realize what a masterpiece it is. Bravo Madonna!

Reba's first album in 4 years, since the wonderful SO GOOD TOGETHER album. Time will tell, but this album doesn't sit entirely well with me. She says it's a combination of all her styles of music that she's done in her career. True, but it sounds jumbled. Some of the songs just don't flow, or just sound like they don't belong. Point and case on &quot;Sky Full of Angels&quot; and &quot;Love Revival&quot;, just don't flow with the rest of the album, and are pretty forgettable. The first single was the country/bluegrass tinged &quot;I'm Gonna Take That Mountain&quot;, a mild hit at country video. The second single is the fabulous &quot;Somebody&quot;, which deserves to be a big hit. The duet with Vince Gill, &quot;It Just Has To Be This Way&quot;, is pretty bland and forgettable. The title track is the true gem on the album, a really nice emotional ballad. Other highlights include &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;If I Had Any Sense Left At All&quot;, and a few others. The rest, I could do without. Sorry Reba.

The music is catchy, soulful, groovin. Highlights include Live, I Belong To You, If You Cant Say No, Thinking Of You, Fly Away, Its Your Life, Little Girls Eyes (tribute to daughter Zoe), and more. Go out and get it!

It Matters To Me was released in August 1995. It is a country album that a country fan cannot do without. There are some very memorable songs on this album, and some of Faith's big hits.Someone Else's Dream is a great song that opens the album, also one of the album's singles. Lets Go To Vegas is another fun song about taking a chance on love in Vegas, and getting married, another single as well. The title track It Matters To Me is a beautiful ballad that will always be remembered, which spent a few weeks at #1 on the country charts.The album continues with another fun song called Bed of Roses. The album takes a serious tone on the fifth track called A Mans Home Is His Castle, a song about domestic abuse. The album starts to regain its uptempo mood with the song You Cant Lose Me, which was the fourth single from the album. I Cant Do That Anymore is another power ballad about a woman who compromised everything for her marriage, but becoming fed up with her husbands attitude claiming she cant take anymore. This was the final single from the album, written by Alan Jackson.The album closes with three more tracks, Room in My Heart, a nice ballad, You Will Be Mine, an uptempo song, and Keep Walkin On, a gospel duet with Shelby Lynne.Faith's first album Take Me As I Am got Faith attention, but there was no denying after this album that Faith is a country diva. This is a must have!

Jennifer Lopez's third major album is one of her best. Her first two albums were nice, but the second one had too much filler, not saying this one has none but she seems more focused on this album. The sound is very sampled and retro, but it works. There's some really great songs here, namely &quot;Loving You&quot; and &quot;Still&quot;, and some embarassing ones like &quot;Dear Ben&quot;, but it's a nice set of music. &quot;All I Have&quot; with LL Cool J, though overplayed, is a great song. &quot;I'm Glad&quot; has a great sound and the video was really cool. &quot;Jenny From The Block&quot; was overblown, but it's not a bad song, but laughable with its lyrics. Other highlights include &quot;Again&quot;, and &quot;Baby I Love You&quot;. Overall, not that bad of an album.

Jessica Andrews is back with another great album to follow up the popular 2001 album WHO I AM. It starts with the first single, the tongue in cheek survival type song called &quot;There's More To Me Than You&quot;. This song also comes in a ballad version, but the uptempo far outshines the ballad version. There is a lot of music that inspires the soul on this album. &quot;I Wish For You&quot; is a positive song that I'm sure anyone in the world could relate to, it's a universal sentiment. The songs seem to have a feeling of relating to life and its simple forms, and that you can get through anything. &quot;They Are The Roses&quot; is a nice midtempo, and &quot;I Bring It To You&quot; is a nice almost power ballad for lovers. Vocally she is in good form, and the music is endearing and enjoyable. &quot;Never Be Forgotten&quot; explores the sentiment that someone might be gone, but that they never leave you, and are always with you in memories. There's some fun uptempo's too, like &quot;Second Sunday&quot; which is about wanting to spend more time with a special someone, or &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;, about enjoying the simpler things in life. She helped pen &quot;There's More To Me Than You&quot; with her boyfriend Marcel, and she also cowrote &quot;Good Time&quot;. Other highlights include the Rebecca Lynn Howard penned &quot;Cowboy Guarantee&quot;, the touching title track, and &quot;You're The Man&quot;. Overall a nice surprise and worth many many repeated listens.

When Barbra tours, its a rare thing, but she NEVER dissapoints. This live album is a reminder of that, that Streisand puts on a hell of a show. Starting off with a young Barbra (played by Lauren Frost) and then Streisand joining her on Something's Coming. This cd goes through many stages of Streisand's 40 year plus career. It is a fine retrospective, showcasing songs from Broadway, Movies and more. There is also a duets section, which features Streisands best duets (many duets such as No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) with Donna Summer, among many were not included). She sings lots of new songs, and old favorites. This is a must for Barbra fans, I highly reccomend it you will not regret it. Anyone who apprecates good music would like it. Cant wait until the VHS/DVD is released early next year!

LUSH LIFE is a collection of 12 classic &quot;pop&quot; songs performed by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra.LUSH LIFE is one out of the three Ronstadt forays into the world of jazz standards and WWII-era pop numbers. Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as &quot;When I Fall In Love,&quot; &quot;Skylark,&quot; &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; &quot;Falling In Love Again,&quot; &quot;Lush Life&quot; and &quot;You Took Advantage Of Me&quot; with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements.

Once again with Threads of Fate, Squaresoft proves that they still make the best RPG, the best games, period. Threads of Fate is a fun RPG where you take the role of either Mint or Rue (you end up playing as both eventually) as they both follow their hearts to find what they are looking for. Theres lots of challenges. The graphics are simply beautiful and the gameplay is wonderful. There's always something going on in this game. This is a must have for RPG lovers, and if you a new to video games this is a good introduction into the world of RPG's, and why Square makes the best games.

Wet is one of Barbra's many great albums, this one was released in 1979, hot off the heels of her Star is Born soundtrack. She was having hit after hit and its no surprise this album did as good as it did. The songs are remarkable. The album has an aquatic theme throughout, as each song encorporates water themes into each song. The title track is a really tender ballad, quite beautiful. On Rainy Afternoons and After The Rain are also beautiful songs you will love. The highlight though is the album closer, Kiss Me In The Rain, one of her best songs. No More Tears (Enough is Enough) is also on here, the duet with Donna Summer which was a huge hit. This is a must for Barbra fans.

Released in 1982, GET CLOSER is in many respects a classic Linda Ronstadt album. It contains the style of songs most associated with her, from pop ballads to country. The album took over a year to record, and features musicians who had played with herfor years. In Kenny Edwards' case, he has played bass with Linda since the Stone Poneys. The title track was nominated for a best Rock Performance-Female Grammy, and the album was nominated for Best Popular Performance-Female. &quot;It's Gonna Work Out Fine&quot; is a duet with James Taylor and a cover of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner hit. Linda also does a smooth cover of Billy Joe Royal's hit &quot;I Knew You When&quot;. Another standout track is her version of Jimmy Webb's ballad &quot;Easy For You To Say&quot;, which probably tops theoriginal. Also is an excellent cover of the Dolly Parton song &quot;My Blue Tears&quot;, both excellent versions. Working with a surefire winning formula, GET CLOSER is prime Linda.

Wyclef and Mary shine on this song titled 911, a song about loving someone so much it hurts. This is classic use of R&amp;B. The vocal talent on this song is hard to replace, as Mary uses her vocal ability to its best, and Wyclef offers quite a bit too. The video is jammin, I highly reccomend this single if you like good R&amp;B and good music.

This is a touching, beautiful album, with Ronstadt's voice the center of a wonderful production. &quot;Still Within The Sound Of My Voice&quot; is a lush ballad featuring the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra (who appear on most of the album). &quot;Cry Like A Rainstorm&quot; adds the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir to create a big, powerful ballad. &quot;All My Life&quot; is a blissful ballad and the first of four duets with Aaron Neville. &quot;Don't Know Much&quot; shows what happens when Ronstadt and Neville harmonize together to create soprano wonderment (and a smash Top 10 hit).&quot;Adios&quot; features Brian Wison's background vocals, and is a classic California ballad. &quot;Trouble Again&quot; is a rocker featuring Andrew Gold on 12-string guitar. &quot;So Right, So Wrong&quot; is a gospel rocker penned by Paul Carrack and Nick Lowe. &quot;When Something Is Wrong With My Baby&quot; is the final duet with Neville and the most soulful. &quot;Rainstorm&quot;was produced by Peter Asher and is a moving record full of rich harmonies and effective arrangements.

Making the transition back to pop, Linda Ronstadt followed a series of forays into her Mexican musical heritage with a collection of well-crafted songs, mostly from the '60s and '70s. It's a similar approach to her early solo records, but here the result is less rock 'n' roll and more adult contemporary. Ms. Ronstadt has always hadexcellent taste in songs to cover, and this tradition continues in WINTER LIGHT, a meticulously crafted and performed record featuring a solid group of session musicians, including her frequent rhythm section of Russ Kunkel and Leland Sklar.Many of these songs are by the finest writers and songwriting teams of the past 30 years, including Brian Wilson, Bacharach/David, Jimmy Webb, and Goffin/King. Her version of &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)&quot; from the Beach Boys immortal PET SOUNDS perfectly captures the song's intimacy and poignancy. She offers an appropriately torchy version of Bacharach/David's &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself&quot; and also covers &quot;It's Too Soon to Know&quot; by Deborah Chessler, a doo-wop-era songwriter and one of early rock 'n' roll's most unknown legends.

I Still Believe is a classic Mariah song. Its a beautiful ballad, that was originally recorded by Brenda K Starr. The wonderful thing about this single, is with many of singles, is Mariah has rerecorded the song and made it into a remix with different lyrics, making it completely a different song than the original. This shows Mariah's creativity and originality as an artist. The best remixes here are the Stevie J Clean Remix (feat Mocha &amp; Amil), I Still Believe/Pure Imagination Damizza Reemix (Feat. Krayzie Bone &amp; Da Brat) and The Kings Mix. A must have for the fans, or anyone, this is one of her best singles.

In her own way, Linda Ronstadt has always defied the rules ofthe music business. A popular vocalist with an impeccable ear for songs and arrangements, Ronstadt has long leaped from genre to genre, bucking popular trends and creating new ones. Imagine, a rock star who personified the mellow Southern California sound of the '70s turning to pop standards, traditional Mexican recordings and opera!FEELS LIKE HOME marks the glorious comeback of the Linda Ronstadt that became a superstar in the first place. Returning to her country/bluegrass roots and joined on fivecuts by long-time collaborator Emmylou Harris, Ronstadt has made one of the strongest country-rock recordings of her entire career. The album's spirit is perfectly captured on &quot;Blue Train,&quot; a mid-tempo country rocker that is a forlorn affair, immediately enveloping the listener.That Ronstadt has not abandoned her rock roots or her sharp interpretive skills is evident throughout FEELS LIKE HOME, particularly on the gorgeous cover of Neil Young's &quot;After The Goldrush,&quot; as well as the wonderfully understated mandolin and acoustic guitar intro to Tom Petty's &quot;The Waiting&quot;--a song seemingly tailor-made for her. That Ronstadt retains her gift for assembling solid gold musical outfits and arranging them to perfection, can be discerned from the list of virtuoso players who appear on FEELS LIKE HOME.

Wynonna's fourth studio album THE OTHER SIDE is not a bad album, but its not her best, but its still a good album. Confused? Well the album has those Southern Rock/Blues type songs like the lead single &quot;When Love Starts Talkin'&quot; and &quot;Don't You Throw That Mojo On Me&quot; (with Naomi Judd and Kenny Wayne Shepard), &quot;The Wyld Unknown&quot; and more. She covers the Linda Davis song &quot;Always Will&quot; and as usual, does an excellent job, with her powerful vocals with just improve with time. &quot;The Other Side&quot; is a spiritual type song, it just had a deeper meaning you have to listen for. &quot;Come Some Rainy Day&quot; in my opinion is one of the best songs she's recorded, a tender beautiful ballad that just reaches out and touches your soul. Very powerful song &quot;We Can't Unmake Love&quot; is a wonderful duet with John Berry. Overall though, this album is strong, but it lacks something. Maybe it depends what type of music you like to hear from Wy, because it appeals to everyone, but something was missing, but its still a pretty good album!

When this album was recorded, Lila McCann was only 15 years old and showed a sense of fearlessness and courage. In song, at least, she is much older than her years would suggest. You can hear it in her voice on LILA as she explores themes of lost love and the timeless needs of a woman's heart. Just listen to her debut single &quot;Down Came A Blackbird&quot;, its far more superior than anything LeAnn Rimes or any other young singer could handle. Lila doesn't sing about things she doesn't know about, unlike other singers, everything on this album is an experience she's had, something from her heart. Whether it's in the rousing &quot;I Wanna Fall In Love&quot; or the ache of loss in &quot;I'm Almost Over You&quot;, LILA is the sound of an exciting new talent making herself known to country music.

From the time she was five years old, Lila McCann was singing in her father's country and western band in Washington state. Still a teenager, McCann climbed high atop the country world, singing about bad marriages and a longing heart with the brio of a woman twice her age.From the mid-tempo country-rock opening track &quot;With You&quot; to the slow, powerful country ballad &quot;Kiss Me Now&quot; and the album's closer &quot;When You Walked Into My Life,&quot; SOMETHING IN THE AIR features top-shelf Nashville songs and McCann's exceptional voice, which often draws comparisons to her friend LeAnn Rimes. In addition to McCann's superb vocal skills, she also shows a flair for songwriting, as she co-wrote two of the sassier songs on SOMETHING IN THE AIR, &quot;I Reckon I Will&quot; and &quot;Can You Hear Me,&quot; with Mark Spiro.

All The Way..A Decade of Song is a 16 song collection with 9 of Celine's hits, and 7 new ones. This is her 'farewell' to the fans as well as a thank you. It proves to be a nice collection with hits like The Power Of Love, Love Can Move Mountains, If You Asked Me To, To Love You More, Because You Loved Me, the overplayed My Heart Will Go On, and more.The new songs are pretty good, like the catchy lead single That's The Way, the ballad If Walls Could Talk, and other good ones include I Want You To Need Me and Live. However, some of the songs lack a little and leave me to be a little disapointed.The disapointment in this collection is her hits that are missing from the collection, such as The Colour Of My Love, Misled, Think Twice, Falling Into You, All By Myself, Tell Him (with Barbra Streisand) and many more. What happened? There are so many hits, but so few made the final cut. Celine should of released a 2 cd set, the 1st cd being her hits, and the second being her new songs. Hopefully another greatest hits album will surface sometime, a more complete collection of her hits.

Trio II is a long awaited chapter in the Trio series. Dolly, Emmylou and Linda are back, with a new collection of songs they have recorded. It will be compared to their successfully 1987 Trio album, but I believe this one stands on its own, as they are both excellent albums.1. Lover's Return - I love the harmonies on this song, they are beautiful and its just a perfect way to start the CD, to showcase the beautiful harmonies we will hear on this album.2. High Sierra - Beautiful voices, beautiful lyrics, beautiful song.3. Do I Ever Cross Your Mind - Emmylou takes lead on the cover of Dolly's own hit. Very nice!4. After The Goldrush - A cover of the Neil Young song, they do it wonderfully, its my favorite on the album. The lyrics are so poignant and meaningful and they truly bring new light to this classic.5. The Blue Train - Linda sings lead on this one, its beautiful and another highlight of the album.6. I Feel The Blues Movin In - A nice fun country song to sing along with and dance with, real nice.7. You'll Never Be The Sun - Remake of the classic, they do it wonderfully with sunny vocals and harmonies.8. He Rode All The Way To Texas - Another highlight of the collection, shows off their harmonies in a tragic tale about a travelling man who moves on effortlessly without a tear.9. Feels Like Home - From Linda's 1995 album, a nice song, basically the same but with Dolly and Emmylou as an added bonus.10. When Were Gone, Long Gone - Nice song to end this collection, beautiful music with great vocals and lyrics.A nice collection, with some great harmonies all throughout. A lot will compare it to Trio, but if you just listen to it objectively, you will see it stands on its own as a great collection of standards, as well as some of their own hits remade.

Barbra's 1974 album ButterFly, produced by Jon Peters, is a mixed collection of songs, ranging from gospel, adult contemporary and more. A lot of people disliked this album, I actually quite like it. The songs are very fun to listen to, like Guava Jelly and Life On Mars. An immediate standout is the gospel flavored Grandma's Hands, sung with all of the passion and emotion Barbra can deliver. Other mentionable tracks include I Wont Last A Day Without You, Simple Man and Love In The Afternoon. Give this one a try, youll be surprised.

Chantal Kreviazuk's second album COLOUR MOVING AND STILL is a remarkable album that should not be overlooked. I am surprised she is not big in the US yet, because she's huge here in Canada. The album was released in Canada in the fall of 1999 and in the spring of 2000 in the US. While her debut was a lot of guitar, this album is more laid back, mostly just Chantal's voice and the piano. The songs are beautiful in their arrangements, and the album is just as moving as her debut. It opens with "Blue", a song Chantal said she wrote after having a conversation with a homeless man. Raine Maida (her husband, from Our Lady Peace) contributes on two songs, "Dear Life" and "Little Things". "Dear Life" is a great tongue in cheek type song, and the video was very visually appealing too. "Souls" starts out slow with a beautiful piano arrangement, then turns into a bit of an uptempo song, beautiful lyrics. "Before You" was the first single, with a memorable chorus that will make you smile and sing along. "M" is a very sad ballad about having a newborn child die. "Soul Searching" is another catchy song but to me my favorite is the poignant "Far Away", which was also a single. "Eve" is a close runner up, a tragically sad song about Eve, the youngest child to die from AIDS. This song is so heartbreaking and real. This is truly a great album, the lyrics are so personal and endearing. Don't miss this one.

Streisand Superman in my opinion is one of her better albums from the 70's. Filled with ballads, and hard edged songs, pop, its a great album to listen to. Superman may seem like a fluffy song with its simple and somewhat silly lyrics, but that voice makes the song take flight and turns it into a beautiful ballad. Another great ballad is the tender My Heart Belongs To Me, and New York State of Mind. These are classic songs. Other highlights include Dont Believe What You Read, Love Comes From Unexpected Places and Lullaby For Myself. This is just a great collection from Barbra, filled with songs that will touch your heart. They are timeless.

Lace is a new trio in Canada just breaking through, they have very nice voices and have talent. From the fun I Want A Man to the reminiscent True Love (Never Goes Out Of Style) there is a variety of country music here, every song is distinct and unique in its own way. Give them a try, youll be surprised.

Yentl is a wonderful soundtrack. This is a movie Barbra wanted to do for so long, and she finally did in 1983. Not to sound clicheish, but the music featured on this soundtrack IS timeless. So many great songs here, sung with all the passion and emotion Barbra can deliver. Whenever I hear A Piece of Sky or Papa Can You Hear Me, there is a lump in my throat. It is so beautiful to hear. Another favorite on this album is The Way He Makes Me Feel, such a beautiful song that demonstrates the emotional tapestry of a relationship, complete with butterflies and shivers. Overall, Yentl is a must have for any Barbra fan, you must have this in your collection. It is some of the most compelling work she has ever done.

Whoever came up with the idea for George Michael and Mary J Blige, two of the most talented artists, to come to sing together was pure genius. These two have voices that carry well together. But the idea to cover the classic Stevie Wonder song? Usually I am critical of cover songs, but they do such a good job on this song. The singing is so soulful and refreshing, it gives the song a whole other feel. Stevie Wonder must be proud. I highly reccomend this cd.

Making a live Garth Brooks album is like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. His concerts--part revival meeting, part love-in, part circus--are spectacles best experienced on a first hand basis. But this comes as close as a mere CD can to presenting the full Garth experience. Wisely, Brooks has chosen to make the audience the star on many tracks. Hearing thousands of fans singing along to &quot;Unanswered Prayers&quot; and &quot;The Dance&quot; is a goosebump-inducing experience. Songs like &quot;Shameless,&quot; &quot;The Beaches of Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;That Summer,&quot; all fine in their studio versions, take on a new vibrancy live.But it's the upbeat songs that really shine. As Brooks and his crack band tear through rave-ups like &quot;Ain't Goin' Down&quot; and &quot;The Fever,&quot; his voice takes on an edge of maniacal glee that drives the audience--and him--into a frenzy. And if the prospect of a live Garth souvenir isn't enough, Brooks has thrown in three new songs, including a duet with Trisha Yearwood (&quot;Wild As the Wind&quot;). The CD is also available in at least seven collectable versions, each with a different cover. Garth devotees can't go wrong with DOUBLE LIVE, and casual fans will welcome having all his hits in one handy package.

I bought this album basically for the versions of Barbra's disco hit The Main Event/Fight. Thats all thats really good on here anyways. The versions include an extended eleven minute version, the short version and the ballad version. The original appears on her 1989 A Collection And More, I reccomend that one highly.

Dangerous is almost a perfect album, it has some of his best music ever, since Thriller. Some of those songs include the first song on the album, Jam. This is such a fresh sounding song, with intense beats and hardcore grooves. In The Closet is another great song with nice beats and melodies, but the intro we could have done without. Remember The Time is one of his best songs in years. Black Or White is a good song, but would be better without the cheap rap in the middle. Who is it is one of his best songs that hes ever done, and Give In To Me is another great song as well with a guest appearance by Slash. The title track is another song with great beats, another great song too.The only songs I dont enjoy on Dangerous are Heal The World, good message but it just overdoes the 'making things better' message, he should take it down a notch or two, his sister Janet masters those issues best on her Rhythm Nation 1814 album. Will You Be There and Keep The Faith, they are nice songs but way too long and overproduced. Gone Too Soon is a nice tribute but it doesnt appeal to me really.I suggest to get this album if you want to hear some of his best songs.

While Reba is busy with her WB Sitcom, they must have decided it was time for another Greatest Hits collection, Reba's third in this series. GREATEST HITS III: I'M A SURVIVOR spans most of her 90's hits, where GREATEST HITS VOLUME II left off. The album has 15 tracks, a generous helping of hits, 12 in all, and 3 new songs. The new songs actually work quite well. First is &quot;I'm A Survivor&quot;, a Diane Warren penned song that is inspiring and also serves as the theme to her WB sitcom REBA. Then we have the ballad &quot;Myself Without You&quot;, which is classic Reba. Then Reba pays homage to Waylon Jennings on the Kenny Rogers cover &quot;Sweet Music Man&quot;, which was produced by Alison Krauss, maybe a hint towards what her next album will sound like, I sure wouldn't complain.It would be impossible to include all the hits, so I understand, but I felt some of her more important hits could have been included, which is why I docked a star. 31 of her hits have not made it to a hits collection since she started doing them, so here's to hoping they all make it on future compilations. However you get some of the best here, such as early 90's hits like Fallin Out of Love&quot;, &quot;The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia&quot;, her duet with Vince Gill titled &quot;The Heart Won't Lie&quot; and the sassy &quot;Take It Back. From her READ MY MIND album we have classics like &quot;Why Haven't I Heard From You&quot;, &quot;And Still&quot;, &quot;She Thinks His Name Was John&quot; and &quot;The Heart is A Lonely Hunter&quot;. From WHAT IF IT'S YOU we have &quot;The Fear of Being Alone&quot;. From her IF YOU SEE HIM album there is the duet with Brooks &amp; Dunn &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot;, &quot;One Honest Heart&quot; and &quot;Forever Love&quot;. Hits from SO GOOD TOGETHER didn't make it because its a general rule with Reba's collections that the album that came out prior to the release of the compilations, generally aren't included but saved for future ones.There was room for more tracks, it would have been nice to see &quot;Til You Love Me&quot; (my favorite Reba song), &quot;It's Your Call&quot;, &quot;How Was I To Know&quot;, or maybe some songs from STARTING OVER (even though Reba has distanced herself from that project and the critics didn't like it, I think it was one of her finest moments). But perhaps later in her career we will receive more of these hits on future compilations. This is a worthy compilation to own for the avid Reba fan, or even the casual one, you can't lose.

After getting more press than O.J. Simpson, Courtney Love and Hole went underground to put together this quality, guitar-driven rock/pop release. CELEBRITY SKIN is packed from beginning to end with up-tempo, hard rock gems that show Love's strength and direction as a songwriter. Co-writing several tracks on CELEBRITY SKIN is Smashing Pumpkins front man BillyCorgan (&quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Petals&quot;).The title track is co-penned by Corgan with Love scripting the lyrics. Kicking into overdrive from the first chord, the song talks about the often-comical pursuit of fortune and fame. The lyrics on &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; make you wonder whether Love is talking about domestic abuse or the drop-dead feeling that results from spotting the most beautiful boy in the world across the room? The lyrics are smart enough to support both theories. Other tracks to check out are &quot;Awful,&quot; &quot;Reasons To Be Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Boys On The Radio.&quot;

This album shocases Tori's talent, while re-emphasizing her ability to pen a song about real feelings and intimate struggles. This album is just one example of Amos' ability as a vocalist to inject just enough feeling and heart without overpowering the beautifully simplistic message of her songs. Little Earthquakes is a must have, this is a very touching collection of songs that will change how you look at your own life. Let Tori into your world, and you will discover the quirky wonderful world of her music.

This is the import version of Doesnt Really Matter, Janet's hot latest single. This is a 3 track cd with the video as an added bonus, something the US release doesnt have. The remixes are good, although the Jonathan Peters one is a little boring, I dont think he did good justice to the song. The Rockwilder remix rules. So you should get this because it has remixes and it also has the video, and added bonus!

Chantal Kreviazuk finally released her new album WHAT IF IT ALL MEANS SOMETHING in Canada in November 2002 and later in the US just recently in April 2003. It's been a long three year wait since COLOUR MOVING AND STILL was released. Chantal fans will love this one. She opens with the inspiring song &quot;In This Life&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; is my favorite song on the album, the arrangement and lyrics work well, very touching and beautiful song. &quot;Flying Home&quot; is a very sad, but beautiful song. &quot;Ready For Your Love&quot; and &quot;Weight of the World&quot; are a bit different for Chantal, trying new things, but very good. &quot;Miss April&quot; is a fun tongue in cheek song. If you are looking for the introspection found on her first album, try &quot;Turn The Page&quot;. The title track is addictive with its chorus and &quot;Julia&quot; is a nice song about Julia Roberts. &quot;Waiting&quot; is a GREAT song featuring Michelle Branch on background vocals. I hope she breaks through to the US, she has so much talent. Give this one a try!

Tyrese's new album 2000 Watts is one of the best albums I've heard so far thats been released in 2001. It's the long awaited album since his 1998 debut album. The first single I Like Them Girls is the perfect R&amp;B summer song, you guys will love it if you haven't heard it already, really great song. I Ain't The One is my favorite track on the album, a Rodney Jerkins produced tracks about the desire for a love thats not based on material things. Just A Baby Boy is another great song with Snoop Dogg. Other mentionable tracks include Off The Heazy, Get Up On It, For Always and Bring You Back My Way. If you want to hear a really good R&amp;B cd this is the one for you, Tyrese has a beautiful voice that is smooth and sexy.

This concert was taped from her concert at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas on December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000. This is her farewell to the concert stage, and what a show it is. From the beginning scene of a younger Barbra (played by Lauren Frost) singing in a recording studio, listenening to her heart and singing the notes how she hears them, then the older Barbra (showing a transition from her early days to now) giving advice to young Barbra about never being afraid to do what your heart says and how you feel inside. This is very true to the career of Barbra, she never compromised anything, she always did things as she wanted to.The first Act consists mainly of a timeline between her early days to her movie songs, all sung with the same passion and emotion as on the recordings. Highlights include Alfie, Papa Can You Hear Me, A Piece Of Sky and more.Act Two contains a duet section, which showcases many of the duets she has sang over her lenghly career. Even is featured is a duet with her and her son Jason Gould, at a young age (video clip). The Technology Dialogue is very humorous and we get to see a personal side of Barbra when she talks with the audience, especially in the Dialogues where she talks about the letter she found that her father had written a long time ago. When she sings At The Same Time, she enstows much faith into everyone, with the children's choir, it is truly beautiful. She even counts down into the new millenium, singing People just before, very fitting. Ending with a rendition of I Believe and Somewhere, truly a spectacular event this was.Its rare that Barbra goes on tour, but with this final concert, fans are once again treated to this show from a performer that never disapoints. Barbra has persevered throughout her career, she has lasted. Her music is timeless, the emotion and passion that goes into the production. Everything about this video is memorable, and I highly reccomend you get it, it is a wonderful show that cant be missed.

This is Mariah's debut, her vocals in top form. Everyone knows &quot;Vision of Love&quot;, her groundbreaking #1 debut single. The album definately has that early 90s feel to it, which is good or bad. She shines on ballads such as &quot;I Don't Wanna Cry&quot;, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; (which were both #1's), &quot;Sent From Up Above&quot;, &quot;Vanishing&quot;, etc. The uptempos are hit and miss. &quot;Someday&quot; (another #1) is definately a hit, while &quot;You Need Me&quot; falls flat. Her vocals are good, the songs are pretty memorable. It's worth owning, not her best, but still good nonetheless.

Terri Clark's album Fearless was long awaited. It had only been a little over 2 years since How I Feel, but it was worth the wait. The lead single A Little Gasoline is a nice upbeat song, a nice indication of how the album is. Fearless is a little more laid back, but an eclectic collection. The title track No Fear is one of the album's best about overcoming anything, finding there is no fear. Sometimes Goodbye is a nice positive song about breaking up. One of the highlights of the album is the power ballad Empty, which should be a single, there is so much emotion its Terri at her best. She hasn't gone pop, which is good because we need more country music people who actually sing country out there. Getting There is a nice sing along song with a catchy hook chorus. Other highlights on the album include Midnight's Gone, To Tell You Everything, and the wonderful cover of Jann Arden's 1995 hit Good Mother. Fearless showcases just what the title says, that Terri is not afraid to make real country music, and not afraid not to follow the pop trends. This is a wonderful collection of material, I highly reccomend it. How I feel is another awesome album. Terri you are awesome!

Trisha Yearwood celebrates her 10th anniversary in the music business with the release of her latest album, Inside Out. This album represents a decade of growth, both musically and personally for Yearwood, who has earned the right to be recognized as one of Nashville's leading ladies.As an artist, Yearwood repeatedly speaks about strong women and their approach to life. This album is no exception with tracks like the no-regrets, 'I Would Have Loved You Anyway'; the no-nonsense 'Love Me or Leave Me Alone'; and the reflective 'I Don't Paint Myself Into Corners&quot;. This particular track includes a special appearance by Vince Gill on background vocals.The title track from this album &quot;Inside Out&quot;, once again pairs Yearwood with Don Henley. Fans of the Henley/Yearwood coupling on 'Walkaway Joe' will be pleased with the reunion of these artists. Co-written by Bryan Adams and Gretchen Peters, this is a song about the depth of love and wanting to know all you can about someone. Together, Yearwood and Henley deliver strong and appealing harmonies.Additional notable highlights include the remake of 'Seven Year Ache' with Rosanne Cash and 'When We Were Still in Love' which was recorded live in the studio with only a piano and string quintet accompaniment. Not many artists could include this type of live performance on their albums, but Yearwood pulls it off beautifully.As an album, Inside Out, is a winning combination of heartache, tenderness and just a certain amount of attitude ('For A While') that is pure Trisha. Always one to put her heart and soul into her music, Yearwood once again offers a glimpse of herself that personalizes the songs and attracts her listeners. Trisha Yearwood fans feel as though her songs reflect their own feelings and once again, she has created an album that people can relate to and will enjoy.

Trisha Yearwood's eighth studio album of original material titled Inside Out is some of her best work out of her entire career. Starting with the first single, I Would've Loved You Anyway, a sweeping love ballad, we know Trisha is back. Her beautiful voice soars over this power ballad, sure to be a big hit for Trisha. The album contains 12 tracks, 2 of which feature guest artists (Seven Year Ache with Roseanne Cash, and Inside Out with Don Henley). This is some of her best work, and it continues to demonstrate Trisha's ability to choose songs that truly suit her voice well. There is something for everyone on here, for the ballad lovers (I Don't Paint Myself Into Corner, Harmless Heart, Second Chance, I Would've Loved You Anyway, etc), the more uptempo (Love Alone, Love Me Or Leave Me Alone, etc). As well this album reunites Trisha and Don Henley, who first sang on her 1992 hit Walkway Joe. This time he lends his voice to the title track. Trisha also covers the Roseanne Cash hit (who sings backup) on Seven Year Ache. The album once again shows more maturity in her voice, it is very strong and clear, as it always has been, but its even better. The album is filled with hit singles that country should pay attention to (since they ignored all the material from her excellent 2000 release Real Live Woman). This is a must for any music lover, fan or not, you will be after you hear this marvelous album by one of the most talented ladies in country music.

Rhonda Vincent's latest album is a breath of fresh air. It's very refresing to hear bluegrass make an impact on music, and become what it is today. With soundtracks like OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, and Dolly Parton's latest bluegrass/mountain music ventures on THE GRASS IS BLUE and LITTLE SPARROW, bluegrass is finally making a comeback.Rhonda adds fuel to the fire with her unique blend of bluegrass, powered by her wonderful band and her strong beautiful voice. THE STORM STILL RAGES is a wonderful collection of bluegrass filled with everything you would expect from an album. Rhonda really shines on Don't Lie, Just Someone I Used To Know, Each Season Changes You and more. There is a beautiful message behind the music too. Take for example You Don't Love God If You Don't Love Your Neighbor, its very true in what its saying to the listener. Bluegrass Express is the highlight for me however. But there is not one wasted moment here, from Cry of The Whippoorwill to the closing Martha White theme, this is quality bluegrass at its best. So climb on board to the Bluegrass Express!

This is the big album we've been waiting for. It's been a long six years since his last album, but the new one is finally out after many pre-emptions and delays. INVINCIBLE is a collection of material that will keep you dancing on the dancefloor, and ballads. Immediate standouts are the dancefloor friendly Unbreakable, Heartbreaker, You Rock My World, 2000 Watts, Invincible, etc. With these new songs he has created a new sound, and his vocals are nice and clear, very smooth. In fact INVINCIBLE would be a great album if it weren't for a few details. The Rodney Jerkins tracks, sound exactly like songs the producer has done with other artists, maybe it varies a bit but essentially they are the same. The other problem lies in the fact that the CD has way too many ballads. Lets see there's Break of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait, Speechless, Butterflies, You Are My Life, Don't Walk Away, Cry, and The Lost Children. That's a lot of ballads, and many are the very same. Cry and The Lost Children have a similar theme, You Are My Life and Speechless also share a similar theme. The ballads weigh down this CD, they aren't layed out good enough, too many fall next to each other. Overall though its a nice collection, but you think after 6 years you'd get a more complete album. Still worth having though.

It was the mid 80's. Barbra's career was in a tiny rut, after her Emotion album of 1984 was not well received, an obvious attempt at jumping onto the pop bandwagon. However I enjoyed it, but many feared a demise in her career. Well she proved them all wrong with this collection, putting her on top of the Billboard Album Charts. Back To Broadway was Barbra's first broadway album, and arguably her best album yet. We get to hear a fun side of Barbra on Putting In Together. Other highlights include one of her biggest hits, Somewhere, a beautiful song, Send In The Clowns, otherwise a boring song but Barbra breathes life into this song, Something's Coming, a hit from West Side Story, If I Loved You and much more. This is a shining moment in Barbra's career, and absolutely essential for any fan.

The Broadway Album is one of Barbra's best albums to date, perhaps her best ever. In order for a broadway song to be sung, they have to be sung from the heart. Barbra does just that. You need to be able to capture the mood of the scene in which the song does, and Barbra also does that. She excels very well and vocally it is amazing. My favorite is her version of Somewhere, simply wonderful. This album is essential.

After a very successful album (Guilty) and a equally successful movie (Yentl), Barbra returned with her 1984 album Emotion. This is probably her most obvious attempt to break into contemporary/pop music. The songs are dripping with pop music. Not to say this is a bad album, I think a lot of people just misunderstood this one. Honestly, some of the songs on here are favorites of mine. Heart Dont Change My Mind is a really beautiful ballad, I really like that one. Left In The Dark is a beautiful ballad, she puts so much &quot;emotion&quot; into it. Other favorites include Clear Sailing and Here We Are At Last. The most obvious pop songs on here are the title track, and Time Machine. It seems maybe Barbra was trying hard to get back into music, and the effort is noticed. There is some nice stuff on here if you just listen closely, but it by far is not her best album, yet it is not her worst either.

This doesn't match up to her superb concerts &quot;The Concert&quot; (1994) and Timeless (2000), but it is still a wonderful collection of Barbra's greatest songs sung live. On this collection, fans are treated to favorites such as Somewhere, People, Evergreen, Guilty, What Kind Of Fool, The Way We Were, as well as other great songs that will be remembered in music history as great music by one of the most distinct, and beautiful voices.

Barbra Streisand's second broadway album, titled Back To Broadway, is a shining moment in her lenghtly career. Once again, like on her 1985 Broadway Album, she has chosen songs that suit her very well. She sings with a passion like no other artist, no one can even come close to replicating the beauty and strength of Barbra's vocals. Some shining moments on this collection include Some Enchanted Evening, Everybody Says Don't, Music of the Night, As If We Never Said Goodbye, I've Never Been In Love Before, With One Look and The Man I Love, although all songs are spectacular. Her renditions of these Broadway songs bring new life to them, giving them new texture and meaning. This is a must have for admirers and fans.

Barbra Streisand's 1989 Collection titled A Collection Greatest Hits And More, contains some of her best songs:Were Not Making Love Anymore - This is my favorite song on the album, it is the first of two new songs. It disapoints me that she doesn't include this one in her tours, because it is truly a classic.Woman In Love - Remember when this song came out, it was a hit. Still as good as when it first came out in 1980.All I Ask Of You - One would argue, but I think she does the broadway songs great. This is an example, she sings with such passion and emotion.Comin in and Out of Your Life - Great song, catchy.What Kind Of Fool - One of two duets with Barry Gibb on here, this would be the slower ballad type one. Their voices work so well together, definately one of my favorites from the Guilty album.The Main Event/Fight - This is another favorite, great disco song. I wish she would include this one in a tour.Someone That I Used To Love - The other new song on the collection, just as good as Were Not Making Love Anymore. She should sing this one on tour.By The Way - The only song from her Lazy Afternoon album that made it on here, still as timeless as when it was first released.Guilty - The other duet with Barry Gibb, this is a more fun uptempo song, really great song.Memory - She does this one fantastically! Theres so much emotion, brings me to tears this song does.The Way He Makes Me Feel - From the Broadway Album, very nice song.Somewhere - Good choice to end the album, very powerful words and overall a great song.

Janet is the best. Her videos showcase her ability to bring her songs into life, with the best dancing anyone has ever done. My favorite on this video is If, both versions (althoug all dance version is better). This was one of her most creative in my opinion and the dance is awesome. I love all the others, they show us different sides of Janet.

This is a wonderful cd to have in your collection. It is a collection of songs Dolly performed live at her Tennessee Mountain Home in front of a live audience, and it was recorded for this cd, titled Heartsongs: Live From Home. Every song is sang marvelously. She puts so much emotion into every note. The album consists pretty much mostly of her early material, with songs like My Blue Tears, Applejack, To Daddy, My Tennessee Mountain Home, as well as many cover songs and standards. A highlight is the closing song, PMS Blues. Great song! This is a must have for Dolly fans, you wont regret this purchase.

Nothing Really Matters is one of the best songs from her 1998 album Ray of Light, and though this single's release was pushed back month after month, it was definately worth the wait. This is in my opinion the best maxi single released from the ROL album (they were all spectacular, yes even POG). Many of the remixes on this are done by Club 69 who do a wonderful job. There are other remixes like the Vikram remix and many more. These are very good remixes, its a shame this single didn't perform well because it has potential. If you get one ROL single this would be the best one, with 9 tracks and great remixes.

Reba's latest effort, So Good Together, is a great collection of songs about love and heartbreak, and what both can bring to one's life. She sings with such passion and emotion that you can feel it in her voice. This is a respectable album, which you could almost call her best album, but you cant, that title first goes to Read My Mind, then Starting Over. However this album is very very very good.The best tracks include What Do You Say, the positive sad song about losing a loved one. I'll Be is another positive song on here. Back Before The War, in my opinion the best track, is a very sad song about getting a divorce, and remembering all the good times in the marriage. Im Not Your Girl is one of Reba's best songs that she's done, very good. Other mentionable songs include Til I Said It To You, Roses, Where You End And I Begin, and more. The only song I dont care for is Nobody Dies From A Broken Heart. Go out and get this one!

Celebrating 20 Years is an excellent video, worth the price. Its the story behind the album, Starting Over, which was a collection of standards Reba chose that she and her family loved to sing when she was growing up. The video has many interviews with Reba, and her family. She explains why she chose each song, what it meant to her. Starting Over was my favorite Reba album, in my opinion her most underrated because the singing talent on the album is her best. Such raw vocal talent, you can hear the passion, the emotion in her voice. Seeing these songs performed live brings a whole new meaning to the album. This is a MUST have.

Bette Midler's 1995 album BETTE OF ROSES is a gem in my opinion. it was her first CD of new material since 1990's SOME PEOPLES LIVES. The album consists mostly of ballads, which fans either love or hate. This fan loves it. No you won't find the campy songs you've come to expect, just some beautiful, reflective songs about love and loss. The album only had one hit really, the song &quot;To Deserve You&quot;, was a big hit with its remixes. I love the original version, it's a cover of a Maria McKee song, the desperation and emotion in her voice is very convincing and beautiful. The album opens with the bouncy &quot;I Know This Town&quot;, a song about going back to your hometown and finding that everything has changed. &quot;In This Life&quot; is a beautiful ballad, that stands as one of the best on the CD. She sings so heartbreakingly on &quot;It's Too Late&quot;. &quot;The Last Time&quot; is a rock type song where Midler stretches her vocals. Another song impressive with vocals is the beautiful &quot;As Dreams Go By&quot;, which should have been a single. &quot;Bottomless&quot; is another winner as far as ballads go. The album closes with &quot;I Believe In You&quot;, a whimsical, reflective song that closes the album well. The album does not have one dud on it, definately a highlight of her career if you are a fan of Midler's ballads.

Ok this is my second Tori Amos CD, and one of my favorites. I was in a record store when it came out and a clerk was saying 'Oh that album isnt good, theres no soul in it', he was refering to this CD, Boys For Pele. Then he said 'Choirgirl is her best, very soulful', I agree Choirgirl was very good, but Boys For Pele was the one I enjoyed more. Same day I bought this the cashier that served me asked me if I was getting this cd, then saying it was simply amazing.The album is very interesting, perhaps her weirdest work ever. The pictures are very odd and the music has hidden meanings, like most of her work does. But its beautiful, its amazing. The highlight for me on the album is the first single, Caught A Lite Sneeze, she sounds simply wonderful, and the music video is great too.Other mentionable songs, the beautiful Horses, Blood Roses, Muhammed My Friend, Talua, Twinkle, Put The Damage On, and a fun one like Mr. Zebra.This is essential this album, you must get it you will not regret it.

Hey Jupiter is one of the most beautiful songs that Tori ever recorded. It was a good idea for her to make it into an LP, and the remix of Hey Jupiter is equally as good as the album version. The Bsides are a wonderful bonus, with Honey, Sugar, Proffessional Widow Remix (very very good) and Somewhere Over The Rainbow, all live. Its a wonderful LP and in my opinion better than 1992's Crucify EP. A must have for fans.

Mila Mason is a very talented woman, but country radio doesnt seem to give her the light of day when it comes to her music. This album is one of the best Ive heard in a long time. Mila is known for her hits Thats Enough of That and Dark Horse, but this album contains the gold, in songs like The Strong One, Dont Maybe Me, This Heart, Let Me Cry and 10 Lb Heart. She has a great voice and her music is completely listenable. Just give her a chance, you will see this is a great singer and that this is a great cd!

Professional Widow is one of my favorites from her 1996 album Boys For Pele, but these remixes dont do justice to the original. Repetitive meaningless remixes that seem to go nowhere. In my opinion, this is just a song that isnt meant to be remixed. The one good track though is the LP Edit. I guess the CD is worth it if you are a Tori fan, maybe you will like it, if you dont its worth having just to collect perhaps.

Madonna's 1998 album Ray of Light was one of her best albums, not her best (that honor goes to Erotica, her most complete album to date). The album has an electronic feel to it, easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics.The album spawned 4 singles (plus one in the UK). Those included Frozen, the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music. The A-side for Frozen was the indian inflenced Shanti/Ashtangi, another wonderful song. The second single was the title track, one of the best songs on the album (they are all gems) its an upbeat song about how in life we move so quickly, yet live life to its fullest. Its B-side was the non album track Has To Be. The third US release was The Power of Goodbye, another fine ballad, and the A-Side was the haunting Mer Girl, where Madonna relives her mother's death. This is probably my favorite song on the album, because it tells such a story and makes you think. I think it should of been a single personally but its not very commercial at all. Nothing Really Matters was the final single, check out the remixes they are the best. To Have and Not to Hold was the A-side. Drowned World/Substitute for Love was a single only in the UK, it was released with remixes of Sky Fits Heaven.This album is another fine addition to Madonna's collection of wonderful music.

A Place in The Sun was well worth the wait. Released in May 1999, country fans around the world fell in with the first single Please Remember Me, one of Tim's best songs ever with such a powerful message delivered. That is what Tim's music does, it touches your heart and makes you laugh, cry, sing and dance.Each of his albums has a personality, and this album is just too good to be true. Each song is a winner on this album. From fun songs like Seventeen, which will make you want to be young all over again, to more serious songs like Somebody Must Be Praying For Me, which gives you hope and love, Tim delivers to his fans.All of the songs released as singles from this album made it big, from the power ballad Please Remember Me which hit #1 almost instantly, to the summertime fun song Something Like That, and My Best Friend and My Next Thirty Years were all big hits for Tim. Even Some Things Never Change was a mild hit.The songs on this album are powerful, whether its a fun song that makes you want to dance and sing, or a powerful ballad which makes you cry, theres something for everyone here. Tim really delivered with A Place In The Sun, and I highly reccomend it for your cd collection.

When Music was released last September I rushed out, and I bought the original version and this limited edition. There is not much difference: same amount of tracks as original version, a few more pages in the booklet, a book type case and a metal belt buckle with MUSIC embedded into it, which is embedded into the cover. After a wonderful limited edition version of Ray Of Light, which was spectacular, one would expect more when spending this much on a Limited Edition version of an album.

All of the songs on Terri Clark's 2003 album PAIN TO KILL are very empowering for women in today's modern world. All the songs deal with either standing up for respect, leaving a bad relationship, or just plain honesty. There is a truth in the lyrics. However Terri only contributed to 5 of the 12 tracks, but it's nice to hear her sing other's songs. The album opens with the hit single "I Just Wanna Be Mad" about a marriage and just wanting to be mad for a while. "Pain To Kill" is a nice uptempo rocker about burning off some steam, "I Just Called To Say Goodbye" takes a look at a woman leaving a relationship and taking all that she needs. "I Wanna Do it All" is a sure fire hit, full of attitude, definately one of the catchiest songs here. "Almost Gone" is a catchy uptempo song about moving on after a relationship has ended, and "Working Girl" laments how hard it is for a woman in today's world being so busy. Vince Gill joins Terri on "Better Than You". The album closes with two wonderful songs, "The First To Fall", the best ballad on the CD, and the closing "God and Me", about a woman only having to answer to God and everything is just between the two. Overall this is a return to Terri's country roots and definately a step in the right direction.

Around The World is a somewhat messy collection of live appearances made by Mariah. Not to say the video isnt good, but it would have been nice to see a full concert, instead of performances from around the world. It would be nice to have the Rainbow Tour on VHS/DVD. Anyway, she sings a lot of her hits here, and there is also some bonus videos on the VHS, Butterfly and Breakdown, which are worth the price of this video alone. However once again DVD gets more extras, with extra videos for the two I listed, and as well My All and The Roof. Anyway this is a nice collection of live performances, but Mariah we are waiting for one of your tours to be released on video!

Bliss is one of those songs that will grow on you and you will most likely love, I did and I still do. This single is a preview of sorts for her album To Venus And Back. Bliss is the lead off single from the 1st CD Orbiting (new studio album), and the two songs Hey Jupiter and Upside Down (both live) are in a way previews from the second disc on Venus called Still Orbiting (live album), even though they are not included. This is a must, they are all beautiful songs by Tori we have come to expect from her.

Mary J Blige started out in the late 80's on an album, which would be released as 1992's What's the 411. It wouldnt be too long that people fell in love with her music. From her first breakthrough Real Love, to Sweet Thing, to the duet I Dont WAnt To Do Anything, this whole album reminds us even in 2001 of how R&amp;B was back then, it was good. Over the years she has proven she is the queen in hip hop/soul/R&amp;B. This is one album you cannot do without, you will regret not getting this album because it is the bomb!

When Aretha Franklin recorded 1971's LIVE AT FILLMORE WEST, she was backed by a group of veteran session musicians on a mix that included interpretations of popular songs and some of her trademark numbers. Franklin makes Stephen Stills' &quot;Love The One You're With&quot; her own with the help of Billy Preston's joyous organ work, while Bread's saccharine &quot;Make It With You&quot; is injected with a healthy shot of sexy sassiness.Franklin's underrated piano playing and a healthy display of her gospel roots make FILLMORE a special recording in Lady Soul's vast canon. Franklin's skill on the eighty-eights particularly shines on her swinging treatment of the Beatles' &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and the jubilant &quot;Don't Play That Song.&quot; Franklin also plays electric piano on &quot;Dr. Feelgood,&quot; and from this point on she turns Bill Graham's hall into a Baptist church. The call-and-response of her background singers and King Curtis' skillful band-leading/saxophone playing lead up to the high point where she brings Ray Charles out for the reprise of the testimonial &quot;Spirit In The Dark&quot; followed by the uplifting &quot;Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand).&quot;

With UNDER RUG SWEPT, Alanis returns with her newest studio album since 1998's SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. The 11 tracks here are excellent songs. Start with the lead off single, &quot;Hands Clean&quot;, a song about an affair with an older man and keeping it a secret, its just a great song that stays in your head. The opening track &quot;21 Things I Want In A Lover&quot; is an edgy rock song where Alanis lists the things she looks for in a lover, not neccesarily needs but qualities that she prefers. &quot;Surrendering&quot; is just so honest and beautiful at the same time. &quot;Precious Illusions&quot; is another winner, its a must single its very good. The album ends with &quot;Utopia&quot;, a song about the ideal world she is seeking to find. Other highlights include &quot;Flinch&quot;, &quot;So Unsexy&quot; and &quot;That Particular Moment&quot;. Overall its a winner and well worth checking out!

I think it's pretty offensive when Gary Allan is nominated for HORIZON awards, when he's been releasing albums since 1996. If anything he should be up for Entertainer of the Year or Male Vocalist of the Year at the country awards. But that's part of Allan's appeal, is that he isn't overplayed like other male acts, yet he still brings in the solid hits time after time. SEE IF I CARE is Allan's follow up to 2001's ALRIGHT GUY.The album opens with &quot;Drinkin Dark Whiskey&quot;, a strong contender for a single, a nice honky tonk to open the album with. The first single is the sentimental ballad &quot;Tough Little Boys&quot;, which was a big hit for him. The title track is a great ballad that would also make a nice single. &quot;Can't Do It Today&quot; is an excellent country song, that pushes his vocals. Other highlights on the set include &quot;Songs About Rain&quot;, &quot;Nothing On But The Radio&quot;, &quot;I Can Love You&quot;, and &quot;Don't Look Away&quot;. Overall another solid set, with any justice he will find a lot of success with this album and get the acclaim he deserves.

Over the course of her almost 20 year career, Madonna has had many many good moments, this being one of them. Vogue is just simply one of the greatest dance anthems there is, Ive never heard a song put together quite like this one. Its amazing, the melody and lyrics will stay in your head and have you singing along. The video for this song was also amazing as well. The remixes are great for this single, it is a must have for any fans.

I was excited when I heard Madonna was releasing another video collection. Originally it was to be titled The Video Collection 1992:1999, but they decided not to include Erotica because that would require the video to have &quot;parental advisory&quot;, so they decided against including Erotica, which is a terrible shame. There is quite a few of her videos, and this proves that Madonna has created some of the most creative and captivating videos in music history. When I see videos like Bedtime Story which is my favorite, it really amazes me, to see such an amazing video. Other great videos on here include Ray of Light, Frozen, Bad Girl, Rain, Human Nature and much more. What a shame that so many of her great videos were not included, such as This Used To Be My Playground, Ill Remember (I understand that they require movie rights perhaps to include those two), Erotica, Deeper and Deeper, You'll See, I Want You etc etc. So it is rather incomplete for a video collection, but there are some great videos on here. It just would of been nice to see those videos, but instead we get Love Dont Live Here Anymore, perhaps her worst video where she is just in a room and its the same shot throughout the whole video. Perhaps our favorite videos that weren't on here, will make it to a future video collection.

Bette Midler's 2000 album BETTE was her first disc in almost 2 years, and she doesn't disapoint. Vocally, I was blown away by Bette on this album, she is in top form, sounding as beautiful as ever. The song selection is top notch, the only exception I could find was &quot;Bless Your Child&quot;, which is a dance number that didn't quite fit here. Otherwise its a seamless set. An album highlight is the latin flavored camp style &quot;In These Shoes&quot;. There's some great cover choices here as well. Her cover of the Temptations &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; is stellar, and shows her emotive skills as a song interpreter. I enjoy the abstract song &quot;Moses&quot;, originally by Patty Griffin, it suits Bette quite well. &quot;Love TKO&quot;, she makes it sound like this song was written just for her, she sings this beautifully. The big ballads of the CD include her cover of Elvis Costello's &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot; and &quot;Color of Roses&quot;. She also hands in a excellent rendition of &quot;That's How Heartaches Are Made&quot;. The song &quot;Nobody Else But You&quot; served as the theme to her short lived CBS TV series, it has a nice jazzy sound to it that'll stick in your head. The album closes with &quot;Shining Star&quot;, and Bette sounds beautiful. Overall this is a really fine piece of work and definately deserves a place in all of Midler's fans collections, even the new fans.

The Way You Love Me by Faith Hill is one of the more fun songs on country radio today, pop radio as well. This single has a remix for the pop radio, which updates the song a little and its nice. The other song on here is another B side to the Breathe album, a soulful jazzy song called Never Gonna Be Your Lady, another example of why Faith is not afraid to record music that is a little different, her Breathe album is a combination of country, pop, R&amp;B and gospel. You must get it.

The Breathe Remix EP, while it may be very expensive, I think its worth the price because the big time Faith Hill fans will buy it, and you wont be disapointed. It includes 4 remixes of her smash hit Breathe, The Hext Hector Remix radio edits #1 and #2, the Main Club mix, and the pop version. It also includes the pop remix of This Kiss, and the pop remix of The Way You Love Me. There is also a bside to the Breathe album, a jazzy little soul song called Never Gonna Be Your Lady. You gotta get this one you wont be disapointed!

Emmylou Harris' latest album STUMBLE INTO GRACE finds her on familiar ground, that is tread by few. She took a more art directed take on her music starting in 1995 with WRECKING BALL and continuing with 2000's RED DIRT GIRL. This is the follow up, and it does not disapoint. This is the future of folk music. Although it's hard to put this in a box musically, because it ranges from a bit of everything. It's pointless to choose favorites, because honestly the entire set is magical and well done. Not a dud here, not even one. &quot;Can You Hear Me Now&quot; is absolutely beautiful, probably my favorite song on here. Her way with words, as she wrote the songs on here all except one, is remarkable. Incredibly poetic. You won't be disapointed with this CD!

Celine's second english album is truly a great album, start to finish. It opens with an introduction of her singing french, then onto the big hit, the inspirational &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;. It's one of 5 songs Diane Warren contributed to the project. &quot;Show Some Emotion&quot; is classic Celine. Then there is Celine's rendition of the Patti Labelle original &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot;, I enjoy both versions, another Diane Warren song. Celine really shines on the ballads, like &quot;I Love You, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Water From The Moon&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (with Peabo Bryson), &quot;With This Tear&quot; (written by Prince) and to me the best ballad, &quot;Nothing Broken But My Heart&quot;. There's also a few uptempos like &quot;Little Bit Of Love&quot; or &quot;Did You Give Enough Love&quot;. The album features a variety of producers, such as John Doelp, Vito Luprano, Ric Wake, Walter Afansieff, Humberto Gatica, Guy Roche, and Richard Zuckerman. You can't miss with this album. A must have.

Music Box is one of Mariah's best albums in my opinion, along with Butterfly and Daydream. The album is heavily ballad driven, but that does not faze the album one bit. The album goes uptempo a few times, Dreamlover the lead single which hit #1 almost right after release, Now That I Know and I've Been Thinking About You. The ballads are breathtaking, from the anthem second single Hero which also hit #1, to the friendship anthem Anytime You Need A Friend. Never Forget You and Without You are wonderful classics as well, and the album closer All I've Ever Wanted is a dreamy lovely ballad. However the standout to me on the album is the title track, which was so deserving to be a single but never was, one of her best songs ever. I highly reccomend this album to anyone who likes really good music.

Don't Cry For Me Argentina by Madonna is a beautiful song from the wonderful movie Evita, and this single includes remixes which spice up this ballad to turn it into a hot dance track that will always be remembered in clubs. Six remixes here, they are all great, they are in English and alternate Spanish versions. A must have for fans!

I dont know why this wasnt released domestically, its a great song, and an awesome single. It has the original version of Against All Odds which is on the Rainbow album, Crybaby (also on Rainbow) which is one of my favorites because of the medley and the words. Also added bonuses are the Stargate Radio Edit of Thank God I Found You, which is an awesome remix (way better than any of the TGIFY remixes on the maxi single). And finally Cant Take That Away (Morales Club Mix Edit). I agree some songs shouldnt have lyrics, but its has a nice beat. Liked the original better though. Must for Mariah fans this single is.

Purple Rain is the soundtrack to Prince's first movie by the same name. It is essential for every Prince fans collection. This is by far his loudest, most upbeat album in his whole collection. The songs are great to listen to, to party to. Classics like When Doves Cry and Purple Rain are on here, some of his biggest hits in his career. As well we have Daling Nikki, Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With U and my personal favorite, The Beautiful Ones. This is one of his most enjoyable albums to date, perfect for any music. The music is significant and retrospective. This album is a must have.

How can an artist be this talented? Mary puts so much into her work, and you know shes lived through this, its not like those songs you hear by those wannabe teen pop artists that sing about heartbreak, they dont know what they are singing about, Mary puts her heart into it, shes lived it. Ballads is a collection of Mary's best ballads, released only in Japan. The songs on here are from Whats The 411, My Life, Share My World and Mary. There is also a bonus track, for those hardcore fans that are looking for Overjoyed, the track produced by Stevie Wonder featured in the Nike ad, well its here. This may seem expensive but its worth it, for this talent who wouldnt want to pay to hear that beautiful voice, a voice too beautiful for words.

This overall is a very good collection. Much of her videos are here, a lot of them but not all of them. Everything from You Give Good Love to I Learned From The Best, with the exception of the inexcused absences of Run To You, I Believe In You And Me, Exhale, I Have Nothing, Im Every Woman, etc, which I find puzzling because they are on the cd but not here, I wonder why? I really think its stupid that Arista advertises this as 'every single Whitney Houston video is included' when they arent. Despite that its a good collection to have, as long as you dont mind missing those other songs. And whats with the DVD having extra stuff, some of us cant afford DVD players. Unfair I say.

Madonna's latest single, Music, is one of the freshest songs out there at the moment. It stands out in a crowd of music from all sorts of artists, that seem to rely on their looks more than talent, unlike Madonna who looks good but makes some of the best music out there. It's a fun track, produced by Mirwais, a french producer. The bside to the album Cyberraga is a Japanese track, with addictive beats and background music. This is an interesting insight of what's to come on September 19th, when her album Music is released.

Sandra Bernhard's Im Still Here Damn It! is a great album. Its taken from her tour. This is the best thing next to seeing her live, or watching the VHS/DVD (Check that out too!!) She is one hilarious lady, and she keeps the crowd entertained with her comedy. She has lots of opinions, and she addresses many current events in her show in a comical way. Some of the best moments on this cd are the skits about John Denver/Princess Diana, Too Many Magazines, Telephones, Courtney Love, hell the whole cd is a roar!! She also sings and has a lovely voice. If you appreciate good comedy you will love this cd, I highly reccomend it. It will brighten your day with laughter and help you appreciate life more.

The Colour of My Love is one of Celine's best english language albums. Powered by beautiful ballads such as the anthem The Power of Love, Think Twice, Only One Road, Next Plane Out, Love Doesn't Ask Why, When I Fall In Love, I Remember LA etc. Celine has found some great songs here. Celine adds that personal touch which makes you feel like shes telling a story to a close friend. Theres also some fun upbeat songs here, like Misled, Everybody's Talkin My Baby Down, Real Emotion and more. Highlights on the album include The Power of Love, Think Twice, Love Doesn't Ask Why, The Colour of my Love and a bonus track for Canadian fans, Just Walk Away. Overall this is a must for any Celine Dion fans collection, any music fan in general.

This is what us fans have been waiting for, a collection of Michael's Greatest Hits, and after almost 4 long years between albums, a new album with new material.First the 1st Disc called HIStory Begins. All of his big hits are here with a few exceptions (Dirty Diana, Leave Me Alone, Human Nature, In The Closet, Jam, etc). Hits from all of his albums. From Off The Wall (Shes Out Of My Life, Rock With You, Dont Stop Til You Get Enough), Thriller (Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat It, The Girl Is Mine, Wanna Be Startin Something), Bad (Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel) Man In The Mirror, I Just Cant Stop Loving You), and Dangerous (Heal The World, Black And White, Remember The Time). This is so addictive to listen to all of his big hits on one cd!The second CD is called HIStory Continues, a 15 track collection of brand new songs (at that time). The lead single combined two of the most popular artists to record one of the greatest songs of our time, called Scream (with Janet Jackson, also very talented!), a song about the press and scrutiny. This portion of the album deals with a lot of anger as Michael was often in the eye of the media with all the controversy surrouding him. They Dont Care About Us is a anti-racism song, very military sounding but its a great song. Stranger In Moscow is one of the best songs on the album, a really great ballad. This Time Around is an ok song, not a favorite for me. Earth Song is probably my favorite on this album, a very sad song about the Earth and how we need to preserve it and treat it better. D.S. and Money are angry songs, and Michael even covers the Beatles classic Come Together. You Are Not Alone is a beautiful song that will forever be remembered for its tenderness and honesty, written by R Kelly. Childhood is a sad tale about a lost childhood, in this song hes speaking of his own. Tabloid Junkie is a funky song about the press and tabloids and scrutiny. 2Bad is a really funky song, and HIStory is a great song that has a very simple message, but its a complex song. Little Susie is a very tragic song that will make you cry, and Smile is Michael's tribute to Charlie Chaplan.This collection is a must for fans of Michael and his music. It reminds us why he makes the best music with the greatest hits, and continues to amaze us with the new songs that continue to break boundaries and set new standards for music, like Michael always has. A must have!

Singer/songwriter Brian McKnight brought his brand of smooth R&amp;B to the top of the pop charts with BACK AT ONE. McKnight not only contributed his writing skills to each song, but wound up producing the entire record as well. Guest producers Rodney Jerkins, Harvey Mason Jr., Lashawn Daniels, and Fred Jerkins III add their signature finishing touches to such tracks as &quot;Stay or Let It Go&quot; and &quot;Played Yourself.&quot; Standout cuts on this all-around excellent album include the &quot;6,8,12,&quot; &quot;You Could Be the One,&quot; the Latin-flavored &quot;Can You Read My Mind,&quot; and the title track, which was McKnight's biggest hit to this point.

Pop-ska rockers No Doubt make their long-awaited return with the follow-up to the hugely successful TRAGIC KINGDOM. The band's fiery dynamic remains intact as vocalist Gwen Stefani's penchant for emotionally charged tales of heartbreak drive the single &quot;Ex-Girlfriend,&quot; &quot;Simple Kind Of Life&quot; and &quot;Bath Water.&quot; In &quot;The Magic's In The Makeup,&quot; Stefani's lyricsspeak of yearning to be appreciated beyond surface beauty for who she really is while the band reaches for a thicker sound and more complex arrangements.Illusions and metaphors exploring the darker side of love set the tone of &quot;Artificial Sweetener.&quot; &quot;Marry Me&quot; uses a melodic, staccato bass line to drive the reggae-tinged tale of the insecurities and doubts surrounding commitment. In &quot;New&quot; Stefani metaphorically compares fresh batteries to the optimism and excitement of a new relationship. &quot;Too Late&quot; isan atmospheric, bittersweet power ballad while &quot;Staring Problem&quot; throttles with the quirky punk energy that long-time fans will embrace. With two years in the making, RETURN OF SATURN finds No Doubt a tighter, more mature unit, focused more on pop songs and production and leaning slightly away from the ska/horn dominated sound of their past.

They've done it again. With each album, Wild Strawberries push the boundaries of their music even further, making it new and interesting for the listener. TWIST is no exception. TWIST is filled with great songs that continue to show the bands growth as musicians and artists. Roberta's voice is as beautiful as ever. What a surprise to find one of the bonus songs is a cover of the 80's hit Tainted Love! Songs like I Know You're Going To Break My Heart and Wrong To Let You Go (the other bonus track) are very sorrowful and sad at times, but they are so beautiful. Somersault, Thousand Kisses, Lucky Day, Wish, and pretty much any song on the album show an artistic growth in the band, and a wonderful sound. This is an excellent album, give it a try if you haven't heard of them, you'll be pleasantly surprised!

It's been a long time coming for LeAnn Rimes to release a GREATEST HITS. After all she had her first hit in 1996 at the age of 13 with &quot;Blue&quot;. Now she's 21 and I guess it's a good time to look back on your career, and look ahead to where you want to go. Let's talk about the new tracks. &quot;Last Thing On My Mind&quot;, a duet with Ronan Keating, is not really a good song and shouldn't be on here. &quot;This Love&quot;, if there's any justice, will get her back on country radio as its a beautiful ballad that shows her great vocals, and is one of the best songs she's done in a while. Also included is &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, to tide fans over until next year when her Christmas album is released. That one could have been left out too. Another complaint is that instead of the original version of &quot;Can't Fight The Moonlight&quot;, one of her biggest hits, they include the Graham Stack Radio edit, which is already available on the 2002 version of the I NEED YOU album. Why not let fans have the original on an actual LeAnn album, instead of having to dig out the COYOTE UGLY SOUNDTRACK every time we want to hear the original? Otherwise, the collection is pretty good. I've never liked her cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, but it makes an appearance nonetheless as it was a hit on the country charts. Each of her albums is covered pretty well, except 2002's TWISTED ANGEL which only &quot;Life Goes On&quot; makes the cut from. Other hits include the mega hit &quot;How Do I Live&quot;, &quot;Commitment&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;On The Side of Angels&quot;, &quot;We Can&quot;, &quot;Written In The Stars&quot;, and many more.

Forget everything you've heard about Erotica, because most of what you heard probably isnt true. This is one of Madonna's most complete albums to date, even more than Ray of Light or her current album Music. Erotica explores the many sides of sex and sexuality. Most would think since its Madonna, its done without taste. Some songs are a little racy in content but if you truly listen you will understand what a great album is. The album well represented music at the time. Its a very dancy album, but at the same time a little dark.The title song is mainly about sex and bondage, which she starts out by introducing the album's main character with the line &quot;My name is Dita...I'll be your mistress tonight&quot;. Fever is a remake of the Peggy Lee hit which has a very nice dance beat. Bye Bye Baby is a fun little song about breaking up. Deeper and Deeper reflects the 70's in many ways, and also has an addictive beat with captivating lyrics. Where Life Begins is a jazzy little number about 'dining in' and exploring sexual fantasies. Bad Girl is a nice ballad as with a sing along chorus and melody. Waiting is a song which implies what the title says, the frustration of waiting. Theif of Hearts is a comical type song (or comes across as) about a woman stealing her man. Words is a nice little song about the confusion of words. Rain is a lush ballad which we will always remember. Why's It So Hard and In This Life both deal with society having trouble accepting individuals for who they are, and the pain it causes. Did You Do It is a song that was only available on the Explicit version of this album, it was not released on the Edited Erotica cd. The album closes with Secret Garden, a beautiful jazzy type song. The album ends at about 75 minutes, this is her most complete work, not because of the length of the album, but because it explores life and is done very well.Many think of Madonna has a bad woman for her work like this, but its very very good. She is teaching us, and if she has to be a little nasty then good for her for expressing herself, they are only words, which have different interpretations from person to person. This is an absolute must have.

Prince's The Hits/The Bsides is a must for fans. If you are a casual fan, I might reccomend buying the separate discs of disc one and two from this collection, but hey you may even enjoy the bsides too. Prince must be one of the only artists to have some of his best work on non LP Bsides (which is what the third disc consists of). The bsides include some very hard to find tracks like Erotic City, How Come U Dont Call Me Anymore, etc. As well there are two new tracks, Peach and Pink Cashmere. It is a very complete collection of his hits, the only one missing I can think of would be the huge hit Batdance from 1990. This is a must have for Prince fanatics for the bsides, and if the new fans are willing to shell out this cash, its worth it for the bsides.

In 1993 Prince released a 3 CD set, called The Hits/The Bsides. Fans who wanted the bsides bought that collection, because that was the only way to get a hold of that cd. As well he also released the first two discs, The Hits 1 and 2 as separate discs. This one I am reviewing is The Hits 1. This disc is a great collection of his early hits, mixed up with the most recent ones. Prince was a revolutionary artist because his music was like nothing out there, he really changed music with his own style. The grooves here are irresistable. The hits here include When Doves Cry, WHen You Were Mine, Lets Go Crazy, 1999, Alphabet St., Sigh O The Times, Diamonds and Pearls, 7 and much more. This is essential for fans of R&amp;B/soul/funk/urban, this is a great cd for new fans of Prince to start on, to get a feel of his music.

No one can do a song like this, he was revolutionary because this music was new and exciting, no one else had ever created music like this. My favorites on here include Controversy, Diry Mind, I Wanna Be Your Lover, I Would Die 4 U, Raspberry Beret, If I Was Your Girlfriend, Kiss, and Purple Rain. This is a must have for fans of R&amp;B/soul/funk/urban music. This is a great cd to start your Prince collection with if you are a new fan. Essential recording.

Breakdown was Melissa Etheridge's first album since 1995's Your Little Secret, she was missed but it was worth the wait for this gem of an album. Breakdown is a return to great music, this is very honest and mature confessions coming from a very talented woman.This happens to be the Limited Edition version of the album, containing three bonus tracks not available anywhere else. So this 14 song collection is a rather eclectic mix of songs, and shes mellowed a bit, but it does not take away from great music as represented here.The first single Angels Would Fall was an excellent choice for first single, its a very beautiful song and one of my favorite singles from 1999. There are some brutal confessions on this album, from the modest Stronger Than Me, to the inspiring Into The Dark, to songs like Breakdown, Truth of The Heart, How Would I Know, Sleep and My Lover.A highlight on the album is the tragic Scarecrow, a song Melissa recorded in reaction to the death of Matthew Shepard, a young gay male who was persecuted for his beliefs and his sexuality.The bonus tracks include Touch and Go, Cherry Avenue and Beloved, all excellent songs which were worthy to be on the original album.This is a great album, for any mood, its very empowering and reflective and honest. You wont be disapointed, I cant wait until her next album &quot;Skin&quot; due May 1st, 2001

Older is one of my favorite albums. Its so calm and easy to listen to, very jazzy and adult contemporary like. his voice is beautiful, it makes you melt. The content in the songs on this album is amazing, such a depressing mood. I would listen to this album in the dark, and just lay there and listen. The songs are mainly slow, but its such beautiful work that I dont mind. The two songs where its upbeat a little are on Fastlove and Star People. Listen to these words in all the songs, they make you realize how short life is, and how we should make the most of our lives before its too late. There are messages throughout this album, you can find them if you really listen. It was worth the 6 year wait for this album, to me this is his masterpiece and his best work.

Brad Paisley is a breath of fresh air in country music these days. He has a unique style of music and songwriting which is compelling and enjoyable. He offers a brand of country which is rare these days in country music, in terms of what is popular. His quirky lyrics come out in songs like &quot;Wrapped Around&quot;, &quot;I'm Gonna Miss Her&quot; etc, which he pays great attention to detail in the classics &quot;Old Rugged Cross&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive&quot;. He isn't afraid to be a traditionalist in country music, and to attempt to move the boundaries to fit his own style of music. Overall PART II is just as good as WHO NEEDS PICTURES, if not an improvement (which I thought wasn't possible). Give it a listen!

When you hear Reba sing on an album, you can hear the emotion in her voice. There is nothing like her, the way she brings a song to life. On tour though, her songs come to life. Visually you receieve another perspective on the song. This is a showcase of Reba's excellent talent as a singer/entertainer. A must have.

What happens when you have a successful GREATEST HITS album? Obviously, if you're smart, you make a new album that is much like her past ones, not to deter much from her success. As a result, you either love it or you don't. I don't love this CD, because it's the same music she's been doing for years now. Yes she tries a new style, dabbling in bluegrass on a few songs, but it doesn't seem to work. She works with the popular Nashville songwriters, which leaves for a bland album. Her last album EMOTION was much more adventurous in terms of working with interesting songwriters like Patty Griffin and Gretchen Peters, who are less mainstream. The typical sentimental songs she's famous for come in new versions like &quot;God's Will&quot; and &quot;In My Daughter's Eyes&quot;, which are much like past songs she's done. &quot;This One's For The Girls&quot;, the first single, is bland and boring. There's a few good songs, namely &quot;When You Love Me&quot;, &quot;How Far&quot;, &quot;City of Love&quot;, &quot;She's A Butterfly&quot;, etc. Some weak points include &quot;Wearing White&quot;, &quot;Reluctant Daughter&quot;, &quot;In My Daughters Eyes&quot; and more. Overall, it's an incredibly safe album and if you like Martina, you'll like this cd. I just expected more and maybe something different.

Gary Allan returned in late 1999 following up his second album IT WOULD BE YOU which in my opinion with SMOKE RINGS IN THE DARK, which is in my opinion, his strongest album yet. The album is true country, plain and simple. He borrows from his California roots and creates a timeless album like this one. &quot;Smoke Rings In The Dark&quot; is a strong start to the album, and how could you lose with &quot;Right Where I Need To Be&quot;. &quot;Lovin You Against My Will&quot; is a beautiful ballad, whereas he does old country on &quot;Sorry&quot;. &quot;Cryin' For Nothin'&quot; is a nice ballad where Gary sings about heartbreak, which he conveys well. A nice cover of &quot;Runaway&quot;, and the honest &quot;Learning to Live With Me&quot;. The album closes with the haunting &quot;Greenfields&quot;. Overall this is his best album yet, and you should definately check it out!

Pop isn't usually my type of music, but Jessica Simpson, she's a different story. She has an enticing voice, a powerhouse of emotion. Irresistible is one of the best songs to come out of pop in quite a while, lingering on the R&amp;B side as well. The song is addictive, you'll find yourself listening to it over and over (trust me I did, and still do). The remixes are ok but the original is the one to celebrate about. She has finally gained the acclaim she deserves, and hopefully will blow those other teen divas out of the water with her beautiful, strong, passionate voice.

Madonna's 1995 album Something To Remember was almost an 'apology' to the public for her ways (in my opinion there was no need for apology, but the album serves well as a collection of her greatest works). Something To Remember implies what the title says, songs that are something to remember. Its a collection of her lush ballads from her hits from Live To Tell to Take A Bow. There are 3 new tracks. I Want You is a remake of the Marvin Gaye song, it was a single for a short while but was pulled when she recorded You'll See, and decided that should be a single. Two versions of I Want You on here, regular and orchestral version, Massive Attack helps on this song. You'll See is one of her best ballads ever, though they are all great. One More Chance is the last new song, another power ballad. Other favorite hits include Rain, I'll Remember, Oh Father, Something To Remember, Forbidden Love and many many more. This is a must for fans of music!

After much public feuding with Warner Bros, he agreed to deliver them one more new studio album, and promptly knocked this out over a long weekend. While the production doesn't sound rushed, the tunes seem like he made them up on the spot: routine funk like &quot;Dig U Better Dead&quot; and &quot;I Rock, Therefore I Am&quot; is prolonged by boring guest rappers; &quot;Dinner With Delores&quot; recycles &quot;Money Don't Matter 2Night&quot;'s pop sound; &quot;Zannalee,&quot; the most enjoyable track on the CD, is just an uptempo blues. Lyrically too, it's all reruns. The silver lining is that, under pressure to create excitement quickly, he falls back on the exquisite lead guitar playing that he often displays in concert but has rarely recorded; the otherwise generic rocker &quot;I Like It There&quot; and ballad &quot;I Will&quot; benefit from this treatment. Michael Bland's drumming is also spotlighted more than on earlier releases. He's capable of so much better that you'd have to be a completist to want this.

It's sad that Lila McCann is having trouble getting her music to connect with listeners. This young lady is clearly talented, she has a wonderful voice and a good ear for good music. COMPLETE is her 2001 album, her third album, and there is definite growth. None of the singles really performed well though. The 10 song set is a collection of ballads and uptempo songs, and the songs have similar meanings to each other. The songs deal mostly with the positive aspects of love and life, and there's always faith and hope. The first single was &quot;Come A Little Closer&quot;, a nice song, but poor choice for a single in my opinion. The second single was the inspirational ballad &quot;Because of You&quot;. The album opens with an uptempo song called &quot;Where It Used To Break&quot;, a positive song about getting over heartbreak. The title track is a beautiful ballad that she shines on about that special someone making your life complete. &quot;Mighty Mighty Love&quot;, &quot;Like A Rocket&quot;, and &quot;Lost In Your Love&quot; have similar meanings but are all great songs, make you want to tap your feet and sing along. The ballad &quot;Whisper The Words&quot; is beautiful and should have been a single. &quot;Is It Just Me&quot; is a fun uptempo song where Lila ponders if there is more to her friendship with a certain someone. The ballad &quot;She Remembers Love&quot; is beautiful and sad, all at the same time. Overall this is a COMPLETE album pardon the pun but its evident and true.

Concertina is a great single to own. There's a great remix which in my opinion is better than the album track. Famous Blue Raincoat is one of those songs where Tori just shines. And I agree with the person who said she breathed new life into the song Twinkle, something that was missing from Pele's version. This is a must have for fans.

Dwight Yoakam's 1997 album of cover songs, cleverly titled UNDER THE COVERS, is often harped on, but if you give it a few listens it will truly grow on you. Dwight takes each song and makes it his own, distinct, yet not taking away the original beauty or intent of the originals. COVERS features his take on songs by the likes of Roy Orbison, the Beatles, Ray Davies, Rolling Stones, The Clash, Johnny Horton and more. Quite the diverse list there. One definate highlight is the duet with Sheryl Crow on "Baby Don't Go". Other highlights include "Train in Vain", "Claudette", "Playboy", "Witchita Lineman", "Things We Said Today" and "North To Alaska". Overall an interesting collection, definately a grower, takes a few listens to sink in. Fans and admirers alike should be pleased.

Where Your Road Leads, is yet another satisfying album from Yearwood. Her voice still is strong, and the songs suit well to her voice. The album has a very mellow feel, but its great, very laid back and unpolished. Some highlights include the ballads There Goes My Baby, Love Wouldnt Lie To Me, Never Let You Go Again, Heart Like A sad song and the title track. The upbeat songs are good as well. This definately belongs in everyones country collection, go get it!.

This cd is a collection of some of Cher's Greatest Hits. While its near impossible to put all of her hits on one cd, this one does a great job of picking and choosing the best ones and putting them on this cd. From her Believe days (Believe, All Or Nothing, Strong Enough, Dov'e L'Amore (Remix)), Its A Man's World (One By One, Walking In Memphis), and other hits such as If I Could Turn Back Time, The Shoop Shoop Song (Its In His Kiss), Gypsies Tramps and Thieves, I Got You Babe, The Beat Goes On, Just Like Jesse James, Heart of Stone, Love Hurts, Love And Understanding, I Found Someone, Love Can Build A Bridge, All I Really Wanna Do, and Bang Bang. This is a great cd for fans of Cher who want to relive those great career songs that Cher has made, or a good starting point for new fans of Cher.

Breathe is one of the most refreshing albums I have heard in a long time. Faith Hill once again crosses over to pop, but also experiments with elements of R&amp;B, soul and gospel, which all work in her favor. Her voice sounds very clear and strong and she sings with so much emotion.The singles from this album include the mega ballad Breathe, the fun sing along type song The Way You Love Me, the romantic ballad Lets Make Love (with Tim McGraw), and If My Heart Had Wings. They have all done very well.Other highlights include the rockin Whats In it For Me, the sweet memorable Love Is A Sweet Thing, the ballads If Im Not In Love, If I Should Fall Behind, and That's How Love Moves. As well the gospel type song There Will Come A Day is very good as well. This is the import version including 4 extra songs with remixes of This Kiss, Let Me Let Go, Breathe and The Way You Love Me.This is the cd you want if you are looking for sentimental songs, for romance or whatever, as well there are some fun songs that will make you dance and sing along. Faith Hill has a winner on her hands here, cant wait for her next album!

Faith Hill has crossed over to pop, and she does it marvelously. She has the voice, the passion and emotion in her voice. Yes its a drastic change, and a lot of people are doing it but Faith is different, because she was suited for pop. She brings out the best of her voice in songs like Breathe, The Way You Love Me, If My Heart Had Wings, There Will Come A Day, That's How Love Moves, If Im Not In Love and more. My favorites on the album are Breathe, If My Heart Had Wings, and That's How Love Moves. She has a beautiful voice, but even though shes pop she still lends a lot to country. This is a marvelous cd, her best work yet.

This is a worthwhile DVD/CD for fans of Miss Lopez. I think the best part of it is the DVD, because Jennifer has some really great videos. They are all pretty good. She's a great dancer too. My favorite videos though are definately Waiting For Tonight, If You Had My Love, Play, Feelin So Good, All I Have and Jenny From The Block. I think she's a good video artist. The CD is of remixes, they are ok but get this for the DVD. It's a cash in by Sony, but it's worthwhile to buy if you're a fan.

The remixes are great, so you should check this out. If you like the song you will love the single, the remixes are off the hook! Go out and get it!

The Woman In Me was a revolution in country, with songs like Any Man of Mine and Who's Bed Have Your Boots Been Under, Shania changed country music. This is a repackaged version, same 12 tracks as the original, with 3 extra songs. You Win My Love (Remix) is a nice remix, the Home Aint Where His Heart Is Anymore/The Woman In Me/Youve Got A Way medley is great and so is the If Youre Not In It For Love (Im Outta Here) remix is nice too. This was repackaged to appeal to the Europe market, since she has made the pop country transition succesfully. Be warned though, the cd says there are 16 tracks, track 16 being God BLess The Child (remix) and its not included, there are only 15 tracks. If you want a really good album that changed country music forever, with great songs that will keep you singing and dancing, this is your cd.

Her debut single, Georgia, gives a glimpse of Johnson's vocal talent, while re-emphasizing her ability to pen a song about real feelings and intimate struggles. This song is just one example of Johnson's ability as a vocalist to inject just enough feeling and heart without overpowering the beautifully simplistic message of her song. As a sample of what Carolyn Dawn Johnson has to offer, here is a cd that won't disappoint, no matter what your mood. There is no doubt that we'll be hearing more from this talented Canadian artist as her star keeps rising.

Head Over Heels marked the decline of a great artist. The problem however, wasnt the music, but by this time many had forgotten about Paula after a 4 year break between albums. The music on here proves to be her best, while it may not have been very successful, this was her funkiest album.There are definite standouts on the album. My Love Is For Real is a breath of fresh air. Paula uses R&amp;B and incorporates it with ethnic music, to create a classic song. The grooves on this cd are remarkable. On songs like Aint Never Gonna Give You Up and Love Dont Come That Easy, she uses R&amp;B and throws in a little latin for some great sounding music, and theres also the great song Crazy Cool. If I Were Your Girl is a very nice ballad. Ho Down is a really funky song, along with Get Your Groove On. Its a non stop party cd, it stops 2 times out of the 14 songs as ballads, the remaining are uptempo and upbeat.While the cd may not be the best, it shows Paula's creativity and willingness to go a different route than expected. Not all songs may be the best but theres some great material here. Worth a listen for sure.

Janet finally returned in October 1997, which could be considered her most creative, and most satisfying work to date. The Velvet Rope is a concept album in many ways, dealing with issues of depression, acceptance and much more. This is represented through the music, as well as the album cover (the pose of her looking down, almost in shame, the concealed letters JANET that only appear if you move the booklet under light, as if she was hiding). There are many issues tackled on The Velvet Rope, depression, acceptance, abuse, homophobia, sex and more.The title track starts off the album after an interlude (only 7 on this album). Velvet Rope is a song about acceptance and the desire to find it, it was slated to be a single but didnt quite make it. You follows, its a song about being honest with yourself and with others, and following through with your intentions and what you say. Got Til Its Gone was the first single from this album, a very R&amp;B flavored song featuring Q Tip, and a sample of a Joni Mitchell song.The album continues with My Need, a song about the desire to be with someone. Next is a nice upbeat number, Go Deep, about going out and having fun partying with friends, this was the fourth single from TVR. Free Xone is a song that deals with the pain of homophobia, and the damage it causes, how unnessesary it is in general.Together Again became an anthem, it is a song that celebrates the lives of those lost to AIDS. This was the second single from the album and it became an instant hit. Empty is a song that deals with pains of online relationships. What About is a very powerful song, about domestic abuse, this was slated to be a single but pulled at the last moment. Every Time is a beautiful ballad that is honest, her final single from the album.Janet continues, getting sensual on songs like Tonights The Night (a cover of the Rod Stewart song), I Get Lonely (third single from album), Rope Burn (dealing with S&amp;M and bondage) and Anything (a sensual song). She hasn't lost her touch. The album closes with Special, an empowering song about feeling special inside, of who you are. There is a hidden bonus track called Can't Be Stopped, another song of acceptance which rings true.The Velvet Rope is an excellent album, its very essential to own. Janet has once again tackled many issues, brining awareness to them, and empowering people with information and faith that will stay with them. The message is simple, we are all special and worthy of acceptance, we need to love ourselves and each other. You wont be disapointed in this album, you must get it.

janet. is Miss Janet's best album to date. It reveals a more sensual Janet, whereas her previous album dealt more with world issues, this album deals with sex and love, the ups and downs. The music is memorable. The actual 14 tracks are great: If, the standout track about fantasies, You Want This, a song about asking for love, Where Are You Now, a beautiful ballad about thinking about where a loved one has gone, Any Time Any Place, a beautiful song about sharing sex with someone not worrying about whos watching, Again, another fine ballad, This Time a song about domestic abuse, New Agenda, a song against racism, and much much more. This album is great, I highly highly reccomend it.

Gloria Estefan's &quot;Gloria!&quot; album is a fun dance filled album that will keep you on your feet. It was risky of Gloria to do this CD, as a lot of artists at the time were heading the dance route, but Gloria proved she wasnt afraid to do something different, that is completely different sounding than the other divas dance albums.Gloria! kicks off with the lead single, Heaven's What I Feel, which is an obvious standout on the album. It was originally recorded by Celine Dion but Celine chose not to include it on her album, so Gloria chose it for this collection. Don't Stop starts out in a very dreamy sound, then kicks into high dance gear. Oye is a nice very upbeat dance song, very latin, and very sexual. Real Woman is nice and has a nice beat. Overall the album has a very disco sound, which is very very nice. Feelin is another standout, a very high energy dance tune. Dont Release Me features Wyclef Jean. Dont Let This Moment End is another favorite, with a killer baseline and chorus. Other songs follow such as Touched By An Angel, Lucky Girl, I Just Wanna Be Happy and Cuba Libre.Think its over? Nope. There are 5 other tracks, remixes of Feelin, Dont Release Me, Heaven's What I Feel, Oye and Dont Let This Moment End. A total of 16 tracks in total, and a cd you must have in your collection. If you like infectuous dance music that will keep you moving, this is a must have. Highly recommended, highly addictive.

Linda Ronstadt's 1998 release is a snugly wrapped package of well-chosen rootsy material--Dylan, Alan Toussaint, Doc Pomus, two by John Hiatt--well-sung by Linda, who shows no diminution of powers after all her musical peregrinations of the last 2 decades. This is simply the kind of music she sings best and producer Glyn Johns has expertly captured her in a no-frills setting. One might say with some justification that this is just another L.A. session, but at the same time this is Ronstadt's domain, and what impresses is the sympathetic, punchy support she receives from ace guitarists Bernie Leadon and especially Waddy Watchel, who even contributes two originals, &quot;Damage&quot; and the lovely &quot;I Go To Pieces.&quot; This last is the album's highlight--a delicate, hushed performance of great musicality. WE RAN ends sweetly with the large Rondstadt clan singing and swaying together to the gentle Mexican strains of &quot;Dreams Of The San Joaquin&quot;.

Lorrie Morgan has one of the most distinct voices in country music. She can sing anything, a heartfelt ballad, a kick up your shoes and dance song, or whatever. The Essential series runs among many artists, who belong to the RCA recording group. The problem that runs in many cases is the artist has too many hits, and there is not enough space so only certain songs make the collection. This is the case with The Essential Lorrie Morgan, it is a great collection of some of her songs, but where are the others? There certainly is plenty of room for more material. However, not to say this album is useless, it has some of her hits. I suggest this to fans of Morgan, or people who are interested in trying new music.

On this album, Wynonna stepped out of the spotlight of The Judds, and out from the shadows of her mother, and made an album on her own, a solo album. With this album Wynonna proves she can sustain a career and survive on her own. The independance is felt throughout the album, because she is singing songs that are her style and ones that she likes. The debut single &quot;No One Else On Earth&quot; is just a reminder of that, in the video she is playing pool, dressed up in leather motorcycle gear, and singing a live concert. The song is so irresistible its no wonder it was a #1 hit for her, which proved just what type of longevity she was able to project to the public. The following singles also fared well, &quot;I Saw The Light&quot;, &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot; and &quot;My Strongest Weakness&quot; were all big hits for her too, which shot Wynonna Judd into country stardom. So this is a very strong album and a must have, one of the best debut album's I've heard.

#1's was a collection of songs on a cd by the same name Mariah released in November of 1998 for her fans, to thank them for making them such big hits. This was released in 1999, and it contains all of those hits in video form. Watching the videos truly shows you how Mariah has evolved into many different forms throughout her career, and the creativity behind her music. She has longevity, and she will be around for a long time to come. It's great to have this video, but when will we see a video collection with the videos that didn't hit #1 like Anytime You Need A Friend, Butterfly, etc. As well there is her newest #1 at that time here, Heartbreaker, which was not on the #1's CD. This is a must have for fans.

The album is such a variety of music, it's hard to classify it under one genre because it appeals to different masses. The bubbly sing along title track is a wonderful song, which was a bit hit for her. "Only Love" is one of her best ballads, beautiful strings and lyrics and vocals, makes for an excellent song. Same goes for "Is It Over Yet", "That Was Yesterday" and "I Just Drove By". She does the Southern Rock and blues we've come to expect on songs like "Rock Bottom, "Lets Make A Baby King" and "Girls With Guitars". Overall this is a strong album with no real filler to be found, just great music throughout.

What's the 411 proved to be one of the best albums in 1992, so its no surprise they released Whats The 411 remix, a heavily hip hop influeced album, released in late 1993. Its a nice album, although some of the remixes just dont do justice to the original. This is a nice collection for fans of Mary and hip hop. It includes 11 of the 12 songs as remixes on here, and one new track. I reccomend this album.

Sara Evans is back with her first new album in 2 and a half years since 2000's BORN TO FLY. The first single is &quot;Backseat of a Greyhound Bus&quot;, a song about a young woman who gives birth to a baby girl out of wedlock on a greyhound bus, and finds everything she was looking for. The album fared alright at country radio, cracking the top 20. &quot;Rockin Horse&quot; opens the album, a rocking country song about a tree that is hit with lightening and the rocking horse is made from that frightening experience. The title track is a bluesy, celtic sounding song that Sara has said, is her favorite song on the album. &quot;Niagara&quot; is the big ballad of the album, it should defiantely be a single it has hit written all over it. &quot;Perfect&quot; is slated to be the next single, or &quot;Niagara&quot;, either one would be nice, &quot;Perfect&quot; is about not needing to have a perfect relationship with someone. &quot;Need To Be Next To You&quot; is another excellent ballad, a Diane Warren penned song that Leigh Nash from Sixpence None The Richer recorded for the BOUNCE soundtrack a few years ago. Sara does it justice. &quot;To Be Happy&quot; is a fun uptempo song that's positive. &quot;Tonight&quot; is a nice ballad that Sara said she wants to be a single. &quot;Otis Redding&quot; is a different song for her but it's definately a standout on the album. &quot;I Give In&quot; is a nice ballad that I predict will be a big hit at country radio if released. &quot;Big Cry&quot; is an interesting song, with its R&amp;B sound. The album closes with the country/bluegrass sounding &quot;Suds In The Bucket&quot; which is pretty funny, and definately a highlight. Overall RESTLESS is a great CD, may even be her best CD yet.

Wynonna's third studio album Revelations is a 10 song collection of some of her best material. I'll even go out on a limb and say this is one of her best albums. She recorded the song &quot;Change The World&quot; before Eric Clapton, but she does cover Tina Arena's &quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot; and the Lynyrd Skynyrd song &quot;Free Bird&quot;. She does them quite well! Wynonna is a country singer, her style is just so different from everyone else. But overall Revelations shows different sides of Wy, and her voice has never sounded better to these ears!

This is one of Mary's best albums, and I love it, although it is not my favorite of hers, that belongs to the spectacular Mary album (1999). This album though was a sign of the times then in 1994. She expresses a lot of pain in this album, and I find it to be one of the essential albums of the early 90's. She grows with every release, and this is a must. Highlights: Mary Jane, You Bring Me Joy, Be Happy, Im The Only Woman, Mary's Joint, etc.

Starting Over is a career acheivement for Reba. Its a shame it did not get more recognition. Critics hated it, fans &amp; Reba abandoned it, but why? This is probably some of her best work. It is a song of cover songs, and Reba does them in her own style so they are different than the originals. This was not a collection of new songs, this was to celebrate her 20th anniversary since she started out. You cannot disagree with the fact that Reba has never sounded this great on these songs. Talking In Your Sleep is a tale about the unfaithful lover who is talking to his lover in his sleep. Please Come To Boston is a restless lover's plea to run away and start over somewhere new. On My Own features Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride and Linda Davis (just listen to those vocal acrobatics they perform on this one!) I Wont Mention it Again is one of the saddest songs Reba has ever recorded, sung with all of the emotion she can deliver. You're No Good is a cover of the Linda Ronstadt hit, sassy and self assured. Ring On Her Finger (Time On Her Hands) is a song about a wife who is unfaithful to her vows as a result of her spare time. Five Hundred Miles Away From Home is a sad song about moving out on your own, away from your home and family. Starting Over Again was recorded originally by Dolly Parton, Reba does it just as well, in a song about family ties being broken. You Keep Me Hanging On is the obvious pop choice here, which was a big hit for her on club play and dance charts. The closer, By The Time I Get To Pheonix, is about a woman leaving a bad relationship. This album is great, the songs she chose were wonderful, and she sings them all with such passion and emotion, the kind only Reba can deliver. So for all of you who never gave this one a chance, or if you did, give it another, its a great album and I think you will agree it is among her better albums!

Starting Over is one of Reba's best, next to her 1994 masterpiece Read My Mind. However, Starting Over didn't fare as well in the reviews. Many viewed it as too pop, and boring. I beg to differ.Starting Over showcases some of the best singing Reba has ever done. She pours her emotion into the ballads, kicks it up on the uptempo songs. Reba sings like she has felt this pain, and expresses it to the listeners as if she's their best friend. It is pop-country, but Reba has that wonderful southern accent. No matter what she crosses into she will always be country, always.All the songs are the cut on here. It is the perfect collection for a country fan, and a must for fans of Reba.

Emmylou Harris has returned with her first original recording since 1995's Wrecking Ball, with a collection titled Red Dirt Girl. Its been a long wait, but well worth it.Ill start by saying this album has a very eclectic feel for it, and a sound that is new for Emmylou, but as timeless as her other music. The listener is offered 12 songs on this collection. The lyrics are beautiful, as well as the melody's and Emmylou's voice. The album has a lot of drum in the background, that &quot;messy&quot; kind of sound but its nice. I think fans will be pleasantly surprised, as well as new listeners of Emmylou (although I reccomend if you are a new listener to try Spyboy or Wrecking Ball first). Favorite tracks on this cd of mine include The Pearl, I Dont Wanna Talk About It Now, Red Dirt Girl and Hour of Gold, although all tracks are wonderful. Worth a listen give it a try.

This is a cd of live performances by artists that appeared on the soundtrack for O Brother Where Art Thou?, which was widely successful. This is a must have, with live performances by Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Union Station, Gillian Welch, The Cox Family and more. This is another fine addition to your bluegrass collection, and I have to say its nice to see it coming to the forefront, it is truly beautiful music for the ears. If you liked O Brother Where Art Thou? then you will most likely want this if you don't already have it in your collection.

Cyndi Thomson hails from Georgia, and brings a certain element to country music which is both intriguing and interesting. She has a really beautiful voice, and she wrote most of the material on her debut album, MY WORLD. The album has a simplistic approach to it, with some honest delivered lyrics that anyone can relate to. The first single &quot;What I Really Meant To Say&quot; is the harsh reality that someone you once loved has moved on, and you just wanted to tell them you still love them instead you pretend your ok. &quot;If You Could Only See&quot; is such an inspirational ballad which Cyndi just shines on. &quot;I Always Liked That Best&quot; is a bittersweet song about remembering the love once shared. The new single &quot;I'm Gone&quot; (written by Kim Richey) is a tongue in cheek anthem which just shines. Other highlights include &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot;, &quot;There Goes The Boy&quot;, &quot;But I want To&quot;, and more. Give Cyndi's debut a try!

Sara Evans found a great deal of success with this album. It spawned off many hits: Born To Fly (#1), I Could Not Ask For More (#2) and I Keep Looking (#5). This album put her on the map as a country favorite. The album is much more pop and comtemporary than her last album NO PLACE THAT FAR, some have compared her to Shania. All I can say to that is at least she is still somewhat country, and her music has substance. The title track is a fun song about being restless and not being confined to keep your feet on the ground. I love the touching &quot;Saints and Angels&quot; with its simple beautiful message about how we are human and make mistakes, but when we come together and love, we possess powers of saints and angels. &quot;I Could Not Ask For More&quot; was a monster hit, the Diane Warren penned hit, was actually done by Edwin McCain before, but I love Sara's version, it suits her well. &quot;I Keep Looking&quot; is a rockin song with lyrics about never being satisfied. Sara penned most of the songs on the album. &quot;Lets Dance&quot; is a fun song with a cool chorus. &quot;I Learned That From You&quot; is the most country this CD ever gets, a nice ballad. &quot;Why Should I Care&quot; is a nice ballad that would have been a nice single. &quot;Four-Thirty&quot; is an interesting song. &quot;Show Me The Way To Your Heart&quot; is an excellent ballad, it should have been a single, it has hit written all over it. &quot;You Don't&quot; challenges Sara's vocals, an angry song about being the one who loves the other more than they do. The album closes with &quot;Every Little Kiss&quot;, Sara's cover of the Bruce Hornsby song. Overall Sara found her footing with this album, and it's a great album start to finish.

Ultra Obscene is one of the best dance type albums I have, Roni Size is a genius and he knows what he is doing. The lyrics and the vocals are very good and addictive, like the beats and they work well together. Each song is different and there is so much variety here. A must have for fans of great music!

Lee Ann Womack took her time with this project. After the huge success of her past album I HOPE YOU DANCE, there were high expectations, the bar was raised high. In turn we have SOMETHING WORTH LEAVING BEHIND, a collection of mature songs that make you think about life. Fans of her country material may be disappointed with this release, as there is not much country to be found here. We have some rock, pop, R&B, and more, but its still her wonderful voice. The album opens with its first single, the title track, a song about wanting to be remembered after we pass away. In a way it tries to emulate "I Hope You Dance" the song, but its special for its own reason. The second single is the ballad "Forever Everyday", another country song that should do well on radio. "He'll Be Back" hails back to Patsy Cline days, a traditional country number that Lee Ann handles and performs extremely well. The subject matter of the lyrics on this album is very mature, and thought provoking. She handles the matters of heart on most of the songs. "Surrender" is a highlight, an uptempo number about giving in. "You Should've Lied" could do well at country radio as well, a tender ballad that is so heartbreakingly real and vivid, she sounds excellent. Her vocals are top notch on this album. "When You Gonna Run To Me" sounds like classic 60's soul, while "I Need You" is an uptempo rocker. "I Saw Your Light" and "Talk To Me" are two other ballad highlights. "Blame It On Me" is another good country ballad, about accepting blame for a failed relationship. "Closing This Memory Down" is a beautiful ballad as well. However there was really no need for a pop version of the title track, the original is just fine. Overall if you can open your mind and enjoy other kinds of music, I think you will be pleasantly surprised with what Lee Ann has LEFT BEHIND.

Tim McGraw is really on a roll, he is about one of the hottest country stars out there right now. His career started out slowly, each album he gained more momentum, until in 1997 he really reached it big with his multi platinum album EVERYWHERE. Each album after that, A PLACE IN THE SUN and SET THIS CIRCUS DOWN, didn't stray too far from the formula, but it worked, they were great albums. With TIM MCGRAW &amp; THE DANCEHALL DOCTORS, the album has a more energetic sound to it, more passion and emotion in the vocals, and its clearly his most personal album yet.On this album he enlisted the help of his touring band, most Nashville musicians are brought on for albums, but not this one. You can tell they feel comfortable with each other, and that Tim trusts them to go wild and crazy when it comes to playing. There is a real unit there, almost a sense of family. It rings true and heightens the songs on the CD, makes you feel like you are listening to a concert.Yes Tim does an excellent cover of Elton John's &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, definately an album highlight. The album's first single was &quot;Red Ragtop&quot;, one of those songs that touches the heart. It was controversial though, with its pro-choice message underneath the surface. The current single is the beautiful ballad &quot;She's My Kind of Rain&quot;, a surefire hit that is already flying up the charts.The music is very organic and real, the instrumentation is absolutely crazy and it harks back to the days when albums were made like this. These days albums sound so polished and perfect, this one is just natural and it flows well. The tracks flow into each other perfectly. I could name off some of the best tracks on the album, the highlights, but the whole set is excellent, not one weak moment. However I will name some of my favorites, such as &quot;Illegal&quot;, &quot;Comfort Me&quot;, &quot;Sing Me Home&quot;, &quot;All We Ever Find&quot;, and &quot;Home&quot;. Overall if you have enjoyed McGraw's past album, this one is a no brainer, you'll love it. Tim's strongest effort yet.

Danni's new label Audium released this new album from Danni, DIVIDE AND CONQUER, in November 2001. Its a must have for all fans. This one is equally as good as her debut 29 NIGHTS, and hopefully with this third album, third will prove to be a charm with radio. "Sometimes", the first single, is a catchy, honest delivery from Leigh, and sure to be a hit if country radio embraces it. Third is a charm on this album, because with each album Danni continues to shine and grow as an artist. There are some beautiful moments on songs on this album, like the touching "Far Cry From Here", or the sorrowful "My Last Chance Is Gone". There's still the uptempo songs fans have come to love, such as "Somebody Oughta Do Something", "He Used To Say That To Me", "Divide and Conquer", etc. This is a well rounded album and hopefully this will prove to be a success for Danni. If you enjoyed 29 NIGHTS or A SHOT OF WHISKEY AND A PRAYER, you will love this album. I know I do!

Carolyn Dawn Johnson's debut album is one of the more exciting albums to come from a newcomer in recent years. She is no stranger to Nashville though, writing hit songs for Mindy McCready, Martina McBride, Chely Wright, to name a few. ROOM WITH A VIEW is an excellent CD filled with great music from start to finish.The first single Georgia is one of those songs that sweeps over you like a cool rain. Johnson conveys enough emotion without taking away from the songs simplistic nature. The impressive thing is Johnson wrote all 13 songs here (note: I have the Canadian version with two extra tracks). The two extra tracks are Tumble and Roll and Not Enough To Stay.Complicated weighs the pros and cons of taking a friendship to another level by becoming lovers, and the frustration it can bring along. I Don't Want You To Go (which along with Tumble and Roll, appears on the UK import of Mindy McCready's I'm Not So Tough, TAR is on the US version too though) is a really fun upbeat song about enjoying being in someone else's arms and spending time with them. Songs like One Day Closer To You and Love Is Always Worth The Ache weigh in on the positive side of being single, while remaining hopeful at the very same time for finding true love in time. Masterpiece is a beautiful song with beautiful lyrics about love as a masterpiece. And Room With A View is remembering someone's death, and their spirit.Overall this is an excellent country debut album, one of many reasons why Carolyn is one of the hottest stars in country these days, her music is very personal and appeals to people, through songs we can all relate to. Very accessible album and I would highly reccomend it.

I was blown away by the raw honesty and pain and ultimate hopefulness of this album... There isn't one line of one song that doesn't just resonate in my soul. Melissa has exposed some wounds that she's been hiding, about the relationship with Julie, and its surfacing here. She's shedding old skin and growing new skin and settling in. The album is a concept album, dealing with the fallout of the album. The saddest songs are Lover Please and Down To One especially in the line &quot;Sooner or later, we all end up waking alone&quot;, very true. Also in &quot;Down To One&quot; the line &quot;What did I ever know about this love anyway&quot; is a stunning revelation, a confession that maybe Melissa realized she didn't really know anything about it after it ended in retrospect, related to her 1993 hit &quot;Come To My Window&quot; where she says &quot;What do they know about this love anyway&quot;. On &quot;Goodnight&quot; the song relates to how Julie never kissed Melissa at the end or never even said Goodnight. The album ends on a high note, the happy upbeat &quot;Heal Me&quot;, which makes reference to past songs (Come To My Window and This War Is Over) with its final line &quot;Let everyone know I'll be coming home again&quot;. The albums sound is a laid back one, lots of texture and drums and loops, but its still got its edge and beauty. This is a very personal album I think a lot of people can relate to. It is a nice compliment to her book, which is a good read I might add. Overall this is a must have album, so go out and get yours, its worth every penny.

Everybody Knows is Yearwood's best album to date. It showcases her ability to choose the songs that suit her voice. Every song on here shines, from the catchy Believe Me Baby (I Lied) to the vocal powerhouse used in Under The Rainbow. Other standouts include I Need You, Little Hercules, Hello I'm Gone, the title track, I want To Live Again and every other song. This is Yearwood at her best.

Trisha Yearwood's fifth studio album Everybody Knows is one of her albums that is often overlooked, but it stands as one of her strongest albums in her entire catalogue. This album makes a strong case that her ability to choose the perfect song is an even more valuable talent than most artists. There is such honesty that goes with the lyrics, there is comfort when Yearwood sings, people listen. The album was a moderate hit, with two #1 songs, "Believe Me Baby (I Lied)" and "Everybody Knows". The vocal quality Yearwood is expressing on this album is remarkable, a very strong and clear voice. Songs like "Little Hercules" or "Under The Rainbow" are beautiful songs that leave you breathless. "Maybe It's Love" is a beautiful song explaining the joys and fears and all emotions felt when discovering love. "Hello I'm Gone" and "A Lover is Forever" show a strong woman in a bad relationship. There is so much expressed when she sings, its truly beautiful. .... The extra tracks are "Even A Cowboy Can Dream", "Find A River", and "Chance I Take". This is essential for any music lover, you will enjoy this album in all its beauty and honesty.

What If Its You, continues in Reba's continuous efforts. The album has a refreshing sound, Reba tells stories, and she puts her all into it. The singles from this album were great, but its the other songs that make this a great album. Im talking about It Dont Matter, State of Grace, She's Just Looking For Him (listen to the vocals in this one). Go out and get it!

This album was released in 1997, after the very successful REVELATIONS album. Her debut, only released in 1992, but she's had so many hits in that short time frame. Her debut single &quot;No One Else On Earth&quot; makes a return appearance, in Club Mix form which adds nicely. &quot;I Saw The Light&quot;, &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot;, &quot;My Strongest Weakness&quot; all make an appearance from her debut album. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Only Love&quot;. &quot;Is It Over Yet&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and &quot;Girls With Guitars&quot; all make an appearance from her 1993 album TELL ME WHY. &quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot; and &quot;To Be Loved By You&quot; come from her 1996 REVELATIONS album. It's a complete collection of all of her hits from 1992-1997, so if you're a fan you should have it already, but if your not a fan buy this and I guarantee you'll see why she is more talented than the other pop-country divas in country music.

Bjork's first non-soundtrack album since HOMOGENIC is positively pastoral compared with that release's experimental electronic textures. Swathed in strings and laced with beautiful choral arrangements, VESPERTINE has more in common with SELMASONGS, echoing that DANCER IN THE DARK soundtrack album's meandering melody lines, while smoothing out and adding an ethereal sheen to the more angular approaches of the singer's previous work.Here the idiosyncratic Icelander lets loose with her full range of vocal stylings, though even her most innocent, little-girl-lost persona can't hide her steely intelligence. The album-opening &quot;Hidden Place&quot; startswith foreboding electronic rhythms--it's about unspoken or unfulfilled desires, and it's simultaneously exotic-sounding and dripping with melancholy, a mood that persists until the gently cathartic &quot;Undo,&quot; with its mantra-like line &quot;It's not meant to be a strife/It's not meant to be a struggle uphill.&quot; Though VESPERTINE's textures might ostensibly seem smooth and seamless, beneath the surface Bjork's emotions run raw and exposed, as evidenced by the final naked outburst of &quot;I love him&quot; in the coda to &quot;PaganPoetry.&quot; VESPERTINE is Bjork's most mature, fully realized integration of her pastoral Icelandic roots and her contemporary electronica (electronic scamps Matmos are collaborators here) inclinations to date.

This is a good single. I love the song Music, and many of the remixes are very good, but some I simply do not care for and some sound quite the same as each other. Nevertheless this is a great single and a must have, because it contains some great remixes, while some not so great.

This is an excellent CD for all Alanis fans. She brings the songs into a different light, and brings a different value of quality to them. Many of them are more laid back songs with a more natural feeling to them, without all the different production, instead there is the guitar, violins, flutes, and just unplugged instruments. She really does well on &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; which I always thought to be a jewel in the crown, a wonderful emotionally driven song. The version of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is in my opinion better than the original because you can feel the emotion in her voice. Same for &quot;Uninvited&quot;, which appeared originally on the CITY OF ANGELS OST. There is also some new songs here, such as the excellent &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot;, &quot;King of Pain&quot; (originally by the Police) and &quot;These R The Thoughts&quot;. And some of her big hits like &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, and some other tracks such as &quot;I Was Hoping&quot;. Overall its a great buy and this one will be in your CD player constantly!

Yes Mariah is here, on this album, but these songs simply do not suit her. Rainbow is one of her most disapointing releases since her Emotions album from 1991. However there is good material, but not much.Rainbow continues her venture into the R&amp;B/Hip Hop territory. She started with Butterfly, which was her best album (still is to date). The problem with Rainbow is it relyies too much on rap artists, over half the songs have a rap artist. Many of the songs on here are ripoff of other artists songs (How Much sounds like Destiny Child's Bills Bills Bills, X-Girlfriend sounds like No Scrubs by TLC). There is not much originality. Even the lead off single Heartbreaker is a rip off, of her own music. Heartbreaker sounds like a regurgitated, recycled song from her previous hits Fantasy and Dreamlover, and Heartbreaker is felt way too much on this album, with the original song, the remix and the Vulnerability Interlude which just has her whining the same lyrics. The song isnt that great anyways. Thank God I Found You, a great song I might add, sounds just like her 1995 hit with Boyz II Men.There is good songs on here. Cant Take That Away is one of her best themes about positive reinforcement since 1993's Hero, truly one of the album's best. After Tonight is like part II of My All, a wonderful ballad which deserves a listen. Against All Odds is a great cover the Phil Collins song. Crybaby has an addictive chorus line. Petals is a beautiful song. The album is good for certain songs, but this is not the typical Mariah album. Ever since she stopped working with Walter Afansieff, her music has gone down, way down. If you want one of Mariah's best, try Butterfly or Music Box.

Ever the chameleon, Linda Ronstadt has continued to progress, evolve, and experiment throughout her multi-decade career. From folk-rock frontwoman to California-rock solo smash, to new wave belter to standards songstress, Ronstadt has never rested on her laurels.Ronstadt began her career as a Stone Poney, and the band's Top 20 hit &quot;A Different Drum&quot; is included here. Linda's Eagles-inspired hit &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; is one of many fine cover tunes in the set. Linda gets tender on &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; and soulful on &quot;Hurt So Bad.&quot; After closing out her rock era with the energetic &quot;Get Closer,&quot; Linda starred in PIRATES OF PENZANCE, which inspired her to record three albums with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. Ronstadt superbly interprets &quot;What's New&quot; and &quot;My Funny Valentine.&quot; An entire disc is devoted to Ronstadt's duets, such as &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; (with James Ingram) and &quot;Don't Know Much&quot; (with Aaron Neville). The final disc contains rarities such as a cover of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; (from the FM soundtrack) and &quot;All I HaveTo Do Is Dream&quot; (with Kermit the Frog). The range of previously unreleased material on BOX SET makes it an ideal companion to her GREATEST HITS.

QUIVER is Wild Strawberries, a Canadian band, their first album since 1996's HEROINE which propelled the hits Heroine and I Don't Want To Think About It. They get better with each album, and I have to say QUIVER is definately my favorite. There's definately a mood on the album, and it is perfectly conveyed through Roberta Carter's unique voice. Once again there are a variety of musicians added to the mix, but its done well, its done right. Some highlights from the album include 32, Trampoline, Gotta Go, Minions, I Guess I'm Amused and You Could Be So Cold, although they are all excellent songs. Give Wild Strawberries a try, they are in a way like Bjork in some ways, also very Portishead like, but they are original in their own sense, there is no one else like them. Give QUIVER a try!!

Dear Lie is my favorite TLC song. It has such meaning, and even though Unpretty had a great message too, this one also has a powerful message. Its up to ones interpretation of what a lie is, to me it helped me realize how my lies will always hurt me and how the lie is other people who betray me and need not be in my life. This is a beautiful song, thank you TLC.

THE SONG REMEMBERS WHEN is not only the artistic highlight of Trisha's career, it is one of the best albums to come out of Nashville in years. Yearwood's soaring voice adds much to the success of the album, but the quality of the songs on this collection are so superior that Trisha is well ahead of the game before she even opens her mouth.The award-winning title track, written by New Yorker Hugh Prestwood, is an emotionally explosive narrative ballad about the power of music. Other songs range from rock (&quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;) to folk (&quot;Hard Promises To Keep&quot;), but most don't stray away from the straight-ahead country-pop style of one of contemporary music's clearest voices. &quot;The Nightingale,&quot; one of the most exquisite tracks on the album, shows the artistry of what an accomplished interpreter can create with a strong melody.

Since her Rounder debut in 1987, Alison Krauss has been praised by critics and country music fans alike. Revitalizing traditional styles of country music including bluegrass, the singer and fiddler is the focus of much public attention. Her unique, yet firmly-rooted approach to country music has won her several Grammys. Her 1995 release, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU, showcases her ability to shine in a variety of settings. The title track and &quot;Broadway&quot; find Krauss in a more pop country environment; however even her pop music is unique in its smart harmonic structure, and her ability to avoid pat or stock poetic devices. On &quot;Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too,&quot; Krauss and Union Station (her almost constant musical companions) switch to a decidedly bluegrass feel, and on &quot;When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart,&quot; she plunges into a Southern gospel style with help from the Cox Family. Alison Krauss has the remarkable ability to make these diverse musical directions seem logical and congruent.

This is a collection of various Dolly Parton hits from her career in the late 70's/early to mid 80's. Some are very well known hits while others may not have done well, but fans have found a place in their hearts for it. The collection begins with the disco/pop hit Baby Im Burnin, from her Heartbreaker album. The original version of Starting Over Again, which Reba McEntire recorded in 1995 as a cover, the song is timeless, from her Dolly Dolly Dolly album. Working Girl and Single Women further venture into pop territory, from her album Working Girl from her 9 To 5 And Odd Jobs album, Single Women from her Heartbreak Express album. But You Know I Love You, another classic song only Dolly could sing is here as well, originally on her 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs album. God Wont Get You is a lesser known hit, it was from her 1983 movie Rhinestone. Old Flames (Cant Hold A Candle To You) makes an appearance, a hit from the Dolly Dolly Dolly album.Other hits include Its All Wrong, But Its All Right, from her Here You Come Again album, House of the Rising Sun, from her 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs album, and Potential New Boyfriend, from the much underrated Burlap and Satin, which still proves to be her most satisfying album from the 80's.This collection is nice for fans, but overall these songs can be found on other Parton Greatest Hits collections. Until fans are treated to a Dolly box set, these will have to do, or until they release a nice collection, we will have to come back to these various greatest hits packages.

Madonna seriously give it up. AMERICAN LIFE was a flop, just move on. Don't keep releasing new singles, that you know are going to flop anyways. WE DID NOT LIKE THE ALBUM and very few people did. It was a failure, just move on. But no, she continues to release new singles and then this EP with remixes, which is just a reminder of what a joke her career has become. A duet with Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears? What's next? The remixes aren't even good, they show a more rock Madonna side, but since they weren't initially made to be rock songs, they certainly don't work as rock songs. Maybe next time Madonna, but you should just go away for a while.

With every album as of late from Reba, with the help of Tony Brown she is moving towards a more glossy pop/adult contemporary/country kind of sound. But it works so its no complaint. IF YOU SEE HIM follows in a string of successfully complete albums along with WHAT IF ITS YOU and READ MY MIND. The first single, the duet with Brooks &amp; Dunn &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot; is the perfect song told from both perspectives about how the breakup is tearing them apart, the sentiment just resonates with the listener. &quot;One Honest Heart&quot; is a declaration of finding a good man who is honest and true, one of the catchiest here. &quot;I Wouldn't Know&quot; is one of those beautiful ballads she does so well, this time expressing her upset over people meddling in her life after an ex. &quot;Invisible&quot; is one of the best here, a surefire hit if it was released. The duet with Linda Davis on &quot;Face To Face&quot; is if not as good as &quot;Does He Love You?&quot;, but better than it, with great harmonies and a great storyline in the song. My personal fave on the album is the ballad &quot;Heart Hush&quot;, which is almost a sequel to her 1994 hit &quot;And Still&quot; from the READ MY MIND album. Overall IF YOU SEE HIM is another consistently good album from Reba, it wont disapoint you.

To Venus and Back is a great cd. The album was originally entended to be a B-sides collection with the live cd, but she was channeling lots of energy from Venus and she created all these new wonderful songs.The first disc, Orbiting, is the new songs. 11 tracks total. Starting off with the haunting, Bliss, which is the lead off single that you will love. Other great tracks on here include Lust (very good), Glory of the 80's, 1000 Oceans, Concertina and more.The second disc, Still orbiting, is the live disc. 13 tracks, where Tori sings her hits from the Choirgirl tour of 1998. Contains many hits like Cornflake Girl, Spark, Mr. Zebra, and more.This is a must for Tori fans, or anyone who loves music with true feeling and emotion.

First off, if you want her a good place to start with Gloria Estefan's music, try the original Greatest Hits. Not saying this is a bad collection, but the first one was just awesome. Greatest Hits Volume II is quite an accomplishment, Gloria has had quite a career and this is another milestone. The album features 10 hits and 3 new songs. Hits include her mega hit from the 1996 Olympics in Altanta called Reach, a very empowering song that enstows faith in you as you listen to it, Heaven's What I Feel, the anthem from her 1998 Gloria! album, the hit duet with N Sync titled Music Of The Heart from the movie of the same name, Oye the high energy flavored Latin salsa song, Turn The Beat Back Around, Everlasting Love, If We Were Lovers, You'll Be Mine, Im Not Giving You Up and Y-Tu-Conga. The new songs are wonderful, starting with You Can't Walk Away From Love (from Original Sin), I Got No Love, a nice latin flavored song, and my favorite, called Out of Nowhere. This is a nice collection, and a must for fans.

After Decca Nashville collapsed in 1998, Danni Leigh was left labeless. Not too far after she signed with Monument, but that was short lived. Two singles from this album were released and country didn't embrace them, so they released Danni from her contract. However, in an odd move, they decided to release the album she recorded for them, A SHOT OF WHISKEY AND A PRAYER, after she was off contract. Its nice for the fans to have. This album features some songs very much like what you'd find on 29 NIGHTS, but Danni also grows as an artist. Some highlights include the upbeat "Honey I Do", "Shiver of Lonesome", "Cruel Heart", and many more. If you liked 29 NIGHTS give this one a try, its just as good and well worth having!

What a year MJ is having. First fans are treated with re-releases of OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD and DANGEROUS, as well as his first new album in over 6 years, INVINCIBLE, but also this repackaged greatest hits album. Before this was only available on his 1995 Double CD HISTORY. No new tracks, just the same CD only its available as a single CD. Hits include Billie Jean, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man In The Mirror, Got To Be Startin Something, Black Or White, and many others. This is now Volume 1, so I'm assuming that Vol 2. (whenever that comes out) will include hits from the new CD on HISTORY, as well as other hits from INVINCIBLE, and who knows what else. To me these songs represent his glory days as an artist, his unmatched success. I don't think he will ever find this success again after all the media exposure he's had in past years, but its a nice reminder and retrospective of a great career by a great artist.

Ultimate Collection is yet another greatest hits album in the Dolly Parton catalogue. 30 tracks of Dolly's hits over her career of 30+ years in country music. The first disc lends itself to many of her country hits, and some duets with Porter Wagoner, while the second disc finds more of Dolly's pop hits. There are a few gems in this collection: Dolly's cover of Great Balls of Fire, and the Holy Roller mix of Peace Train. This is a nice collection that will tide fans over until we are treated to a Dolly box set.

I'll start by saying I am a huge Prince fan and supporter. This is a &quot;collection&quot; of his hits. Um well Prince has a lot of hits, so how can they just have it on one cd? One answer: they cant. This is to me, a waste of time. You can get all these songs (except Money Don't Matter 2Night) on either THE HITS/THE BSIDES or on THE HITS 1 and THE HITS 2 (on HITS 1 and HITS 2 not all these hits are on each, but on both cds). This is so disapointing, especially for long time fans. If you are a long time fan the only reason I could see to want this is collectors or something, because fans have most of his albums and it's just a better deal to get THE HITS 1 and THE HITS 2 or THE HITS/THE BSIDES. Don't waste your money on this (unless you want to) just get the cds listed above, for a more complete Prince greatest hits collection.
