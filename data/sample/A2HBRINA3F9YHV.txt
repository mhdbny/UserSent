No, Kenneth Branagh was not arguing his British heritage, he's trying to convince amnesia victim Emma Thompson that he is not the reincarnation of her former life husband who is trying to kill her. The supernatural meets Hitchcock meets American classic film noir, and Kenneth Branagh managed to complete this gear shifting, classy film for it's day. It got great reviews in 1991, it's still considered to be top notch 15 years later (judging by all these reviews.) With a super cast: Andy Garcia, Thompson and Branagh, Wayne Knight, Campbell Scott, Robin Williams (in a scene stealing performance) and veteran foreign actress, Hanna Schygulla, who plays a small but key role. Branagh, actually doesn't play a Brit either, he plays two roles: the quirky American private eye, Mike Church, and the overbearing, German composer/conductor husband, Roman Strauss.It was a real change of pace from the Die Hard type thrillers that were being hammered out at that time, but it was a welcome change. When I originally saw it back then, I could tell that although different, I was definitely watching something special.Branagh, hot off the success of his first film, Henry V, where he was director and star, he managed to pull off this gem of a thriller, again taking both director and lead actor roles. It proves that he is one talented fellow, and his former wife does an even better job perfecting her American accent. Emma Thompson is radiant in both roles, one set in the past and her supposedly reincarnated self in the future.Not a fast paced thriller, but it has it's moments, and the twist ending is really juicy. I also liked the visuals and cinematography, especially in the black and white sequences. It had a simple, but stylish look, which I think makes it hold up very well today. One of the best films of the early 90's.

After wearing out my old video every Christmas in the 90's, this one took a while to show up on DVD. It was first out in Europe in 2002, so being able to play multi region DVD's, I quickly snatched it up. It was rather low budget, but finally, in 2004, a slightly better quality US version came out!The incredible music, the vibrant colors, the excellent voice-overs, and of course, the story. A young girl is told by her Grandfather the tale about the wooden nutcracker he gave her as a gift. A boy soldier was turned into wood by the evil Mousequeen, and to become a real boy again, he must defeat the Mouseking.With the voices of Phyllis Diller, Kiefer Sutherland, Peter O'Toole, and Megan Follows, you just can't go wrong with this cast. An excellent treat, meant to be watched every year!

UCOS - The Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad is a rag tag, elder bunch of ex-cops who are assembled by the recently demoted DS Pullman, played by Amanda Redman. She had a bust go bad where she accidentally shot a dog, and suddenly she finds herself leading this team of cops whose best years are far behind them. All of her 3 re-hires left the police for various reasons and each has their own share of personal and emotional issues they are dealing with. For Pullman, she is constantly trying to balance her career and finding the time to continually hit the dating scene in her 40's. Handling the stubborn and erratic personalities of her new team is another challenge.Jack Halford (played by James Bolam) is the only member who left the police force on amicable terms, having retired as a D.C. Superintendent. He is forever haunted by the hit and run accident that claimed his wife. He seems to be the oldest, but also the clearest thinker of the squad.Brian Lane (played by Alun Armstrong) is an ex Detective Inspector who was sacked for having someone die while in his custody, which he strongly felt was not his fault. He's sort of a pill popping, memory machine with OCD who memorized everyone's resume who has ever worked at Scotland Yard. Also, if you ask him what he was doing on July 19th, 1978, he'll remember.My favorite of the bunch, and what drew me to find this show in the first place is the star of numerous popular UK shows over the years, including the highly popular Sweeney and Minder series, Dennis Waterman. It seems he always plays a ladies' man in every series, and this one is no exception. You will usually find him hitting on his boss, being pursued by ex-flames, or eyeing the multitude of women he encounters during his cases.Waterman's character Gerry Standing, although no longer performing his legendary fisticuffs as he did in Minder and Sweeney, still manages to pull some punches with his sharp tongue and wit. He was fired for breaking his superior's jaw, a Commisioner Bevan, who just so happens to be UCOS's supervisor, so you can imagine the interaction just waiting to happen there. A classic Waterman highlight is when the crew is reviewing film of a late 60's protest for a case and he jumps up, all serious-like and says, "ey, wait". Then pauses the video only to point at a girl in the crowd and say, "I had her".After a rather long 90 minute pilot, once you get into normal episodes, they are strong from start to finish. Unlike US TV shows, where going back and viewing the first 5 or 6 shows can sometimes look awkward; and actors don't really find their niche in their character, sometimes up until the 2nd season; this superb gang of British vets really nail their characters right out of the gate. I felt the pilot was merely a preview of what was to come, and it certainly doesn't play like the rest of the episodes do in the series (they are much better). I was almost ready to write the series off after the pilot, but I'm glad I didn't.One other fine character is PC Clark, played by Chike Okonkwo. In this first series, he is the low on the totem pole, young police constable, who really offsets all the older characters. He was always eager to help out and offer his young viewpoint and detective skills to the team. I feel this will be a slight negative not seeing him reappear in later shows, as his character does not return for series 2. A minor setback to an otherwise strong and entertaining British show.While following that TV crime solving mold, it still manages to have that certain appeal that US shows simply do not have. It's also great to see one of my favorite actors, Dennis Waterman, still holding his own after 4 decades. He also sings the show's theme song (a staple for shows he's starred in over the years) and a cover of the Traveling Wilbury's End Of The Line in one of the episodes.It's surprising to see this as a US DVD release, because as far as I know, this only appeared on some PBS channels in certain parts of the country, and I haven't seen it on any cable channels (maybe BBC America at one time?). I think it's high ratings in it's later seasons in the UK have warranted a US "trial". I say trial as in they release a first season, and only subsequent sets come out if sales are good. However, even The Sweeney hasn't had a series 2 release in the US yet, so I presume there's a slim chance of all 5 later series of New Tricks getting released here, but you never know. I'll just have to continue ordering the Region 2 series sets. Series 6 aired in July in the UK with a DVD release scheduled for Sept. '09.

A collection of 50 photographers taking snaps of the theme of 'Tati', a Paris department store which first opened in 1948. Some of the photos are very "store" related, but others you would never guess they went hand in hand with the retail chain Tati. This book was only $...when new, and for it's size and photographs, it's a bargain. I'd say only about half of the 100+ photos are interesting, but well worth the $5-$6 price you can find this book for used nowadays. This book also contains two Martin Parr photographs of mannequins, and a bunch of employee candids taken by Catherine Deneuve.

First off, you may want to read this, then skip over to the season 1 boxed set, as that contains this episode, and the entire first season. It pretty much makes this one defunct. Aside from that, this is a very thrilling start to the SG-1 spinoff, and they've assembled a very interesting team for the show. It's too bad Robert Patrick didn't stay on as a regular, as I liked his tough as nails military leader attitude, and the clashing between him, Sheppard and Weir.The story revolves around SG-1's discovery of a new Stargate on Antartica, at the end of Season 7, and then Daniel Jackson uncovers a link to the Stargate at the real Atlantis. This new team, headed by civilian Elizabeth Weir, and militarily by Colonel Sumner (Robert Patrick) are sent in to investigate the new find, knowing that they may never safely return. What they find is the ancient city of Atlantis, buried beneath an ocean on a planet in the Pegasus Galaxy. There, they find there isn't enough power to keep the city's shields from imploding with water, so they send a team led by Sumner to a random Stargate dialed from an Ancient code. It is here they encounter the two main races of beings which they will deal for most of the first season, the Athosians and the Wraith.The Athosians are a nomadic tribe like people, who are friendly, and the Wraith are their feared enemies, but were not seen for a very long time. The SG team's presence there causes the Wraith to awaken, and the Athosians are forced to relocate to Atlantis, which has now risen from the water to become a spectacular city again.There is plenty of action and tension throughout the entire pilot, and it gives high expectations for the new series. I was a little skeptical whether or not they could keep the interest up through an entire season, and was rather disappointed with the second episode (not bad, but a simple plot that was rather dull), but overwhelmed again with the 3rd episode, which was one of the best of the first season. I won't get into the rest of the season, as this is only a page for the pilot, but you can check season 1 and I will write a review there soon.

There isn't a clue on the outer packaging or inside on who actually mixes these two discs. While there is nothing spectacular about the mixing effort, the job gets done and what really stands out are the plethora of tracks that make up The Grand DJ Mix. While this ZYX label out of Germany usually does unmixed compilations, they have had a few mixed ones, and this is certainly at the upper tier of what they have released. Now, maybe they are 1 step away from actually hiring a name DJ.It's house and electro on side 1, and tech house and minimal on side 2, and whoever chose these tracks really has a keen eye (and ear) when it comes to all 4 of these house genres. Tom Novy heavily populates disc 1, with of couple of his popular house singles, and one of his remixes. Freemasons, DJ Sneak, and Roger Sanchez also make an appearance.Disc 2 has some real strong tracks including Pig & Dan's Blobz and the incredible Gotham City by Marc Vision. There seem to be a lot of 2006 tracks in both mixes, with less from early 2007, but the choices are solid and aplenty. The price is a little steep, but look around and you may find a deal. I think it was well worth it for the 28 continuous tracks found here.

I want to point out right away that I thought Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is excellent in this film. After just watching her rather low key performance as a police inspector in Claude Chabrol's The Color of Lies, she shows a dynamic emotional range that I wouldn't have thought her capable. It may be her acting skills have really been finely tuned in the 6 years between films, or it could have just been the way her unemotional character was written for Chabrol's film. Either way, she makes this very dark film, enlightening.The film portrays a 5 point timeline in the lives of one married couple just completing a divorce. The events are shown in reverse order: 1) the divorce, 2) nearing the end of their marriage, 3) the birth of their son, 4) their wedding night, and 5) when they first became attracted to each other. Breaking the film up into 5 segments actually seems to speed the film along, and breaks the monotony of what could otherwise have been just another talky, morality driven French film.I think the reverse order is a creative way to tell the tale, however, you ought to make sure the two last chapters (or first chapters) are strong enough to carry the weight of the end of the film. Unfortunately, the first 3 events are what makes this film, and it sadly tails off with the last 2. They are suppose to be the more upbeat time of the relationship, and should be the most satisfying of the film, but we are left with one that is very contrived, and the other rather dull.The opening divorce sequence is very moving, and opens the very dramatic first hour of the film. We quickly see how much of an a-hole Gilles (the husband) really is, and how seemingly sweet Marion is (that is, until the wedding night sequence). The next event is a time after their son looks to be about 6-years-old, and you can see the marriage isn't going very well. It features a scene with Gille's gay brother and his aloof younger boyfriend. You can see Marion beginning to break down at this point, and we do not seem very far away from what is to become in the opening sequence.The birth of their son features Gilles being a butthole again, and deliberately not being present for the delivery. While it is not clear how strained the marriage is at this point, it features some poignant scenes with Marion alone in the hospital. At one point, she is in tears on her cell phone speaking to Gilles, who still hasn't come to see her, and asks him to bring some things from home. I think it's the most effective moment in the film.That brings us to the last 2 moments, or the first 2 in their relationship. Up to this segment and right through to the end of the wedding ceremony, I felt this was playing out to be one superb film. Even in the darker tones of the first hour, I thought we were now getting into some juicy territory with the happier times in this couple's lives, and that this may play out to be one of the best French films I've seen in a long time. However, that all came crashing down with a preposterous turn of events on their wedding night. I won't give it away, but it features an offensively stereotypical, Marlboro smoking, American male character. Despite this rather cheap shot at portraying an American in a French film, it's not this character that disturbs me as much as how Tedeschi's character reacts in these scenes. There is nothing before or after this that would remotely lead anyone to believe that she would act this way. It is a very unfathomable scene, and literally crumbles the movie at this point.On to the last scene, where the couple first begin an attraction. What we have is a boring sequence where Gilles is on vacation with his girlfriend and meets Marion, a brief work related aquaintance, and seems to fall for her. There are NO sparks in these scenes and we are left with what should have been the best part of the film, being the dullest.There was a deleted scene called prologue, which featured a time just after they were married, and moving into a new home. I thought this was a great scene, and had it been included in the film, it would have been the brightest point, in this otherwise dreary relationship. Maybe Ozon didn't want to name it 6x2! I would have taken that sequence over the wedding night one or their first meeting.A brilliant film for the first hour, but a let down in the last 25 minutes. This could have been a strong film, with a failed relationship told in reverse order. Even with the gloomy tone of this troubled marriage, some stronger writing in the last key segments could have made this one impressive piece of cinema.

A whopping 35 tracks on 2 discs, and aside from the occasional electro track, it's all dark techno and minimal. If the quirky, grinding sounds of minimal techno aren't your favorite genre, do not look here, 'cause you'll be getting a heavy pounding of it. With all the crazy pings and beats in this type of music, I must admit that while driving, I sometimes can't tell if my car's falling apart or it's just the track! The aptly named Nightdrive signifies an incredible experience while playing this in the car, and I have been abusing both these discs over and over again since I got them. It's definitely not dance floor friendly music, and the tones are dark enough to scare the wits out of most elderly people, especially at night! There aren't really any true, full vocal tracks on here, with just the choppy acapellas and digitally distorted voices usually found in techno.Out of the 35 tracks, I'd say there were only 4 that I was displeased with, and actually, they are both the starting two tracks on either disc. I just start each CD with track 3! Disc 1 is really downtempo until you get to tracks 7 & 8, and by track 9, things really heat up. The rest of the disc features some really funky but dark tech stuff, with Trentemoller's remix of Coincidance, and ends with an epic James Holden re-rub of an oddly titled Black Strobe track. Oddly, this last track is over 10 minutes, when you were lucky to find a 5 minute track in all the rest.Disc 2 is higher energy stuff from the get go, and other than the 2 opening tracks, the entire disc is solid techno and tech house tracks. What stops this set from getting 5 stars from me is lack of monster tracks; tracks that blow up the mix and take it to the next level. While there are a few on here, nowhere near the quota I would expect from a 35 track mix. Don't get me wrong, other than the 4 tracks I mentioned, ALL songs are average to well above average. It's just that the well above average ones are fewer, and when you get to those, they only usually last 3 1/2 minutes (the average of most tracks on here), so you find yourself hitting the back skip button a lot. This mix definitely could have used longer cuts of some key tracks, even if it meant less tracks (there are certainly plenty of them anyway), and a better helping of top notch melodies.Overall, a must buy for the tech house fan. I just wish the tracks were a bit more selective, fewer, and longer.

There isn't a flaw in this film, from top to bottom, from the incredible interpretation of the Shakespeare lines, recited in top form by an incredible cast of talented British actors, to the most intense battle scene in any period movie, bar none. This came out several years ahead of all the popular later period piece movies such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Rob Roy, etc., yet there hasn't been a film to match it yet.Kenneth Branagh should have won the Oscar that year, but he was an unknown, young director/actor, so Hollywood and the Academy would have never cast such a risky vote at that time (1989).From Kenneth Branagh's incredible debut acting work, to the already seasoned actors such as Judi Dench and Brian Blessed, the cast is one of the best in British film history. Watch for a young Christian Bale and one of Emma Thomspon's early film roles (not sure if this was officially released before The Tall Guy or not, but if it was, it would make it her first film role).Movies like this are rare, and I can't believe it is out of print in it's current form. It screams for a complete special edition release!

This track is a slower paced male vocal trance, but not in terms of the beat or melody, rather the way it's sung. It's not your typical sounding male trance track (which there have been many as of late) and it takes a few listens to become accostomed to it.I didn't like the radio edit, as it's a very short cut of the original mix and it starts with what I feel is the weakest part of the track, the guitar chords. The original mix is superb, with a faster, storming sound, not heard from as of late from PVD. It's especially not like anything on Reflections. The Deep Dish mix is a scrumptuously long journey (11:00+) into some seering house beats, meshing very nicely with Wayne Jackson's vocals. There are 3 breakbeat mixes on here, but with the great original track, the blazing progressive house mix by Deep Dish, and what I will refer to next as the best track on this single, quite frankly, who needs them!Martin Roth had two great remixes for Blank & Jones on their Perfect Silence CD single. He also has a bootleg remix of British pop band Keane's single This is the Last Time, called Martin Roth Hands on Keane Remix that is all the rage by DJ's and trance fans this summer, and he follows that up with another incredible remix of a male vocal track. The Martin Roth remix of The Other Side is THE BEST cut of the track, by a long shot. I didn't think it could get better after hearing the original and Deep Dish, but it did! A frenzied beat at a dance floor stomping pace, adding flair and an incredible vibe to the vocals, making it all come together pefectly in this mix. When he flutters out the vocals at the end of the lyric "... tongue is tied", you know you are in for a wild ride!I can't recommend this single enough, as you simply have to have the Martin Roth mix. With the hot Deep Dish remix as well as a great original mix, this CD is worth it's weight in gold.

Those of you looking for an experience similar to Politics of Dancing 1 will be scratching your heads after popping in Disc 1 of this 2 disc set. It's slower, melodic trance, and nothing like POD1. Track 1 is a very bland track, and to tell you the truth, so are 2, 3, & 4. Things don't pick up until track 5, and things really get going with the stunning vocal track Burn on track 6, however it runs a bit too short for my liking (actually only 4 songs on here go longer than 5 minutes). Things get real boring again with the not so hot track Alone. Luckily, 2 scorchers are up next with Lolo's Why and Purple Haze's Adrenalin. The rest of the disc features some decent tracks, but there were 2 vocal tracks I did not care for at all: Filo & Peri's Closer Now, and White Room's Someday. They really don't sound good.Even though it doesn't say so in the liner notes, I am pretty sure that PVD had a hand in re-editing just about every track on here, just like Politics 1, because nothing is listed as a remix version, yet most tracks vary from their original form. Most of the tracks are fine, including his twist on Adrenalin, which is great in any form, however there are a few duds, and on disc 1, he destroys an otherwise classic bit of melodic vocal trance: The Unknown by White Water featuring Melinda Gareh. The original is pure bliss with a incredible melody that glides through and carries the vocals, but by changing that, he made it into a very dull track.Disc 2 brings us back into familiar dance floor friendly territory and heralds back memories of Politics 1. It's a high energy trance pace that never lets us, and the beats are non-stop. It saves this 2 disc set, as you can tell so far that I am not very high on disc 1.I do have 2 gripes about disc 2. The first is that I got the Other Side CD single a prior to this coming out, and I was blown away by both the original version, and the even better Martin Roth remix. What I didn't care for was the guitar riff in the track, and luckily, it is only in the track for a quick few seconds. This is one reason why I didn't care for the radio edit, because it starts with the guitars. Well, PVD has re-edited the original and made is start with the guitars, ughhh! The trancey start of the original version would have started this disc off much better.My other gripe about this disc is 2 tracks he really did not re-edit well. Mark Norman's T34 is not so bad, but he still lost some of the impact of the super fast original by slowing it down a tad. The real horror was when I heard Marco V's More Than a Life Away -- OMG he butchered it bad!!!!!!!!!! The original is THE hottest trance vocal track of the summer, and it's a crazy, blazing fast techo speed trip, with even trippier vocals. Well, he slowed down the speed of the vocals, and the entire track, and made it sound like crap!!! I couldn't believe it! Unfortunately, most of you may be hearing this track for the first time, and think this is how it shoud sound, as it's appeared on a bunch of other mixes already released in Europe but not here yet (like Ferry Corsten's Creamfields and Cosmic Gate's Back 2 Back Volume 2). I urge you to wait to hear it elsewhere, because this is not how this truly incredible tracks should be heard.With that aside, Disc 2 is still a screaming ride of relentless high energy trance, and is a full of the neverending dance floor beats that made the first Politics so special. Have no fear if you thought disc 1 was different, because it's Paul back in true form here (except for his unforgivable butchering of More Than a Life Away).Overall, I give the first disc 3 stars and the second disc 4 stars, averaging up to 4 stars. It's a good thing he re-edited everything here to freshen things up, because when I first checked out the tracklisting, I saw no less than 12 tracks I already had from other mixes released this year. It's all good except for the bad reworking of the 3 tracks I mentioned, and a little let down on disc 1 with some boring tracks. Disc 2 is really the stand out. Still definitely worth picking up.If you want some even better trance mixes released this year:Cosmic Gate - Back 2 Back Vol. 2Art of Trance - Tales of the Unexpected (note: disc 1 is prog. house)Ferry Corsten - Creamfields (note disc 1 is electro house)Kyau vs. Albert/Talla 2XLC - Technoclub Next 2George Acosta - The Lost WorldMarkus Schulz - Miami '05

Let's just say that the programming of the wireless unit this toy comes with is just about the most frustrating thing I have ever encountered in all my years experience with electronic items. It is similar to programming a universal remote, but even more complicated. Method 1 has you point your remote at the unit, and go through a series of annoying commands, in a very annoying voice (my son kept screaming for me to stop this method due to the awful voice). The muffled voice you hear when you test it in the store, is similar to the muffled programming female voice, but luckily, when you get this device going, the sound no longer comes out of the unit, but rather it's all done through the TV (one high point).After 1 of 3 methods to program this device, you have to test it with the test DVD. Method 1 failed for the two times that I tried it. I skipped Method 2 because my DVD player was not listed in the back of the booklet, so I would have had to try at least 17 codes for the brand name of my player. I went to Method 3 and tried that for countless minutes, just standing there like and idiot, pointing the thing at the dvd player and pressing the code search button dozens upon dozens of times, only to give up, as none of them worked.I then went back to method 2 and picked a code from a model simliar to my DVD player, and lo and behold, it worked! Sadly, after my son played the game once, the unit somehow reset itself and I had to reprogram it all over again. After a few times now, it seems to be staying programmed.As far as the DVD stories you play, all are excellently illlustrated and narrated, however the words that go along with the story appear at the bottom, and as the narrator speaks, each word is highlighted in red. With a white background, and black lettering, and a very colorful story being shown, the red highlights of these thin letters do nothing to prompt my 4-year-old (who has some reading skills) to look at them. I feel the letters should have been bolder, with a stronger emphasis on each word, instead of a slight italic and turning to red. There is no time between lines, as the next sentence is started immediately (unless there is a question to be answered in game play mode) so there is no time to reflect and re-read the sentence, unless you opt for the boring read to yourself mode.I think these discs are more apt to perk the reading skills of 6 & 7 year olds, as younger kids will just be interested in the games and questions, and colorful pictures, rather than reading the sentences. Let's face it, immature children under 6 are use to watching movies on screen, not reading sentences, so it's harder for them to free their mind of the visual aspect, and concentrate on words and what this is suppose to teach. I feel a simple book would teach the younger ones reading better than this can.The glitches I mention are that sometimes, when you press the asterisk for a question about the page you just read, it replays the same exact question you just answered. Also, in the Where the Wild Things are DVD, there is one question where it asks the viewer how many monsters are on screen. Well, technically there are 6, as they enlarge 5 of them from the background screen, however they don't fully cut off one monster in the background, so there are 6 on screen, yet the answer choices are 2, 5, & 7, which really agitated my son, because he knew there were clearly 6 monsters on the TV.The discs do have some fun games, like the Dress Corderoy game on the Corderoy DVD, so there are lots of other educational aspects other than just reading. I think as a reading tool, this would be better suited for 5-7 year olds, and the 3-5 year olds have a better time answering the questions and playing the games than reading the sentences to the narrated story.

Best Bond leading girl (Diana Rigg); Best Bond Villain (Telly Savalas as Blofeld); Best Bond cars; Most flirtatious Bond women (at the ski resort, including a pre-Space 1999 Maya); Best Bond locales (Portugal and Switzerland); Best Bond chase sequences (through the snow); The longest Bond movie (2hrs.22mins.); and the Best Bond action and entertainment in any one flick.So what if George Lazenby wasn't the best Bond, the above mentioned reasons speak for themselves. His performance was decent, and once settled into a few scenes in, you forget about him being cast and simply enjoy the most exciting Bond action. Had Connery done this film, this would unanimously be considered the best Bond in history, but even without him, we true fans still know which film is tops.

25 tracks formulated into 16; that is what Kiki has managed to do. Some tracks have elements of up to 2 others meshed in, and he does it with the greatest of ease, not leading on one bit as to what he has done. It also helps that the tones and glitches of minimal and tech house allow this to go on, as certain tracks alone can sound like there are several layers going on in the one tune.What sets this mix apart from several other house DJ's who have done things like this in the past (Jonathan Lisle and Sasha are two that come to mind) is a phenomenal track listing, knowing just the right time to add an element of another into it, and some scrumptuous house melodies with just the right amount of vocals. There are a few tracks that I think would be a little on the dull side, had they not had the extra elements, but they are instantly enhanced by there extra additives. This mix as a whole is one solid listen, without any need for track skipping.I love it when in track 6, Michael Forzza's Kahana, Kiki picks one little moment to sneak in one line of vocals from his own track, So Easy to Forget, and the effect is brilliant. Kiki also literally uses sounds of a herd of elephants when he mixes in Donal Tierney's track Safari with a few of the early tracks in the mix. Overall, it's a work of art as a whole and one of the best mixes I've heard all year.This CD comes out of Ellen Allien's techno label, BPitch Control and I can't wait for Sascha Funke's Volume 2 of this series! I am not sure if he's going to incorporate 2-3 tracks into 1 like Kiki did, but I am expecting it to be good as the track selection, the samples I've heard, and Funke's previous work suggests that it will. Oh, and about that cover: it's a photo taken while Kiki is moving his head from side to side, hence the funny face and messy hair! Sascha Funke repeats the look on the just as kooky cover to Boogy Bytes 2.

This mini album contains 5 different songs (or technically 4 because The Drums is basically a reworking of The Drive), and a total of 8 tracks. You get the two versions of the incredible tribal dance floor anthem Resonate (original and DJ Vibe), 3 versions of what I feel is a terrible house track, Shakedown, by Stacy Burket feat. Audio Angel (cheesy repetitive lyrics that drove me nuts), The Drive, The Drums, and Deep Dark Jungle.The Drive and Drums are both very hard, tribal beats that suck you right in with just the rights doses of drum mixtures to keep it very intersting and very sexy. I love both of these. Deep Dark Jungle just goes nowhere and the repetitive dull beats are not worth repeating.I would still purchase this CD to get 4 slammin tracks out of the 8 on this disc, the 2 Resonates and the The Drive and The Drums. These 4 are not to be missed.One other note that these mixes are all very long except The Drums which is 6:28; the rest are all 9:47-11:35 in length, so despite being containing only 8 tracks, they quickly fill up the entire CD.

From the opening, distorted, cult like vocals you know you are in for a dark trip through techno and minimal. With the exception of a few lighter tech house sounds, like when Dear slips in a very short (2:30) segment of the catchy melody of Ame's Raj, this remains a full mix of gritty and somewhat spooky techno. I wouldn't call this spacey, just futuristic, as it is brings to mind the gritty, industrial look of the very appropriate CD cover.The mix is just about as perfect as it can get, with virtually no hint of track transitions. With mostly percussion and barely any melodies, these stripped down, primal tracks just bleed into each other with surgical precision. Believe me when I say, there isn't a bad track on here, and you can let it play from start to finish whether it's the first time hearing it, or the 10th. One of my favorite mixes of the year, any genre.

After Believe, it was going to be hard for this trance team to recreate another stunner, and they have missed the mark. One thing that struck me as odd right away is that Vanessa, the lead singer, isn't mentioned anywhere in the liner notes. I mean, yes she's on the cover, but her name gets no credit.What is also a huge difference from Believe is while Vanessa led all vocals tracks on that album, she only does half the tracks on here. One track is sung by Nikola from Sphere, 3 tracks by Jan Loechel, a male member of 4 Strings and writer of their lyrics, and on a few other tracks, we have no idea who sings them because it doesn't tell you in the liner notes, and it is not Vanessa.Out of the 5 best tracks on the CD, Vanessa sings none of them. I do not like their first single, turn it around, as it's too slow and the vocals are rather awkward sounding (although the Club Mix peps it up a bit). The two dance songs sung with male vocals are suprisingly excellent offerings, and I feel at least one of them should get an official release: Love is Blind and Euphoric Eyes. The 3rd song with male vocals is a ballad which I don't care for.Let's get to the best track on the CD, track 9, Until You Love Me. It's catchy, great background melodies, and instantly strikes you upon first hearing it. One question I have is who the heck sings it, because it's not Vanessa and they don't tell you on the CD???Anyway, the 5th standout track is Back to Basics, which is really an instrumental with sporadic vocals (not sure who again??) thrown in, and it's a damn good one.If you take out the Intro and Outro, you have 14 tracks, and only 5 are exceptional. The rest are mediocre at best, with good background trance music, but less than appealing vocals and lyrics. A few tracks are real duds. I mean would you crank this CD up in your car and be caught dead singing along to &quot;I Hear Dolphins Cry&quot;. This has to be one of the cheesiest vocal trance tracks I've ever heard.As for the Ian Van Dahl Lost & Found vs. 4 Strings Turn it Around debate (they are both released on the same day), it's a no brainer, hands down win for Ian Van Dahl. That CD is much more solid with only a few sub par tracks. A complete 5 Star album. See my review on that one.This one gets 3 stars from me, due to 5 exceptional tracks. The best track, Until You Love Me, is outstanding and as good as any on the Ian Van Dahl Lost and Found CD. You may want to buy this CD for these few excellent tracks.

Dave's mix on Disc 1 is much, much better than the last two therapy sessions, with a better track selection, barring the awful track Ill Ssa by Kosmas Epsilon. There are 3 Kosmas tracks in a row, and the first and third are phenomenal, but the one in the middle is a real stinker. It was the worst track on the Across Borders Greece CD and the V-Sag remix featured here simply cannot revive an already dead track. It's too bad, because this mix would be near perfect otherwise. Normally, an average or slightly below average track doesn't really spoil the mix, but unfortunately, this one rally puts a damper on the flow of things. Apart from that, this is one hot progressive mix featuring lots of great breaks and the juicy, dark stuff Dave and his label mates have been known for lately.Track 1 is also from the Across Borders CD, but Dave spiced it up by adding a cool accapella by Infusion. Track 2 is a stunning new track by Habersham, and then after the 3 Kosmas tracks, we get into another great instrumental, Cloudbrake, which sounds incredible for the first half, covered with My Own Worst Enemy, but the second half of the track has the vocals competing too much with the melody and drums. I think you will agree that hearing Cloudbrake on it's own on disc 2, is fine without having to add anything. It does sound very cool with the acappella added, but only to a point. An excellent remix of My Own Worst Enemy also appears on disc 2.The 2nd half of Dave's mix is solid, and my standout track is Maracash. A couple of male vocal tracks are in there, and he finishes with Phatjak, who had another hot track, Supermarket, on Across Borders. There are only 11 tracks on here, as Amazon incorrectly added the accapellas as tracks.Disc 2 starts off with Cloudbrake and then My Own Worst Enemy, as I mentioned, and then an unmixed version of Kosmas's buzzing Monster Puppy. Stel and Tone Depth serve up a pounding version of Ashland's Clear, but the even better female vocal track on here is the last track: a hot acid remix of Highland's No Way Out. One track I didn't care for is the updated Steve Porter mix of Mojo, as I don't think it did anything for this classic track.One of the best prog. house mixes of the year on Disc 1, and the added unmixed Disc 2 makes this purchase a no brainer. All tracks on here are from Dave's Audio Therpay label, which indicates that it is featuring some of the hottest stuff in the progressive world right now.

Above & Beyond put out their first artist album, and it's a donwtempo, chill type atmosphere, with a few upbeat tracks, like their smash hit, Air For Life, and the instrumental World on Fire. You get about 4 female vocal tracks, 3 male vocal tracks, and the rest instrumentals. ALL the instrumentals are very good tracks, with a wide range of melodic sounds, and for the most part, are the best part of this album. The standouts include Indonesia and World On Fire.Air For Life, not really a vocal track with verses and a chorus, just some ethereal vocals, is a great track, but I am not to pleased with Zoe Johnston's track or the final female vocal track, Home. They're a little too slow with less than exciting lyrics. However, the absolute best track on this entire CD, and one of the top trance tracks I've EVER heard, is Can't Sleep, sung beautifully by Ashley Tomberlin of Luminary. All the Luminary tracks, including their most recent Amsterdam, are all exceptional vocal tracks, and Above & Beyond certainly picked one of the classiest vocalists in trance right now for this one. The only other question mark is why isn't Justine Suissa back for at least one track? They've had so much success with her in the past (as Oceanlab), not to mention she is arguably the best trance vocalist of all time, you wonder why she wasn't asked to do something on here. Anyway, Ashley more than makes up for Justine's absence and appears on what I consider to currently be the best vocal trance track of the year thus far.As for the male vocal tracks, I believe they are all by the same guy who sings on Alone Tonight. I don't care for his voice at all, which makes me not like any of these tracks.For the most part, a very good artist album, which seems to be hard to come by lately in trance. Just don't expect an upbeat dance floor type mix, because you'd have to go to their previous mix CD's for that. This is something very different, but very good.

I saw all the negative comments regarding the voice of Bob changing, and I can definitely see how it will make a child scratch their head if they are use to Bob acting and speaking differently. In the "new" Bob's defense, it does say it is a brand new series so you can't expect it to be exactly the same. I am sure a lot of the kids who use to watch this have gotten older and moved on to other cartoons and characters so they won't care, and the old fans still have all the other videos and DVD's to see.I like what I am seeing in this show, and my son is crazy about Bob building a new town from the ground up. He now has to have every toy associated with the show and is a newly devoted fan. The new actor who plays Bob is none other than the awesome Greg Proops from Whose Line is it Anyway fame!!! He is a riot in person and I couldn't think of a better voice to start the new Bob series off with. Neither my son nor I had ever seen the old Bob or heard the old Bob, so I guess we are starting at the perfect time, as it seems Greg Proops is here to stay in the new series. I can tell you my son loves this DVD, both the intro episode to the new Build It show, and the two new episodes of the series. You get a lot for the money on this DVD.While fans of the old show can cringe at the "new" Bob, he's just won over some new viewers and I am sure he will continue to do so, especially since he is now voiced by such a talented actor. One thing I question is where does Spud the potato guy fit into all this? He is a very odd character and his British accent (which I hear is new) seems to fit his quirky self. I just am not sure who thought up a potato person to be a friend of a construction worker??I noticed this new DVD lists Greg Proops as the voice of Bob on the back cover, and all the others did not, so hopefully it will continue to do this on future DVD releases, this way the fans of the new show can stick with it, and fans of the older series can still decipher which ones they want.

While it may fall into some other psychological film categories, it's definitely a unique film in it's ownright. From it's quirky characters, to it's unusual settings (including a lot in Bale's blue collar worker's place of employment: a machine shop), to it's visual look and direction, this is very close to being called a true, one of a kind film. It is a dark film, with some dark scenery, but I was actually surprised to find that the overall look was nowhere near as bleak as one would be led to believe from the film's promotion and reviews. It's kind of like Anderson's film Session 9, which set in an abandoned mental institution, you would think it would be a dark looking film, but it really isn't.Christian Bale, Michael Ironside, and Jennifer Jason Leigh all give top notch performances and make you forget about it being a slow moving film, shot in hotel rooms, dingy apartments, and a grungy machine shop. The actor who plays Bale's psychological nemesis is also excellent. He is the one Bale keeps seeing show up at work, while no one else does.The film is strong enough to keep your interest thorughout, with interesting dialog, character development, and the mystery element. While not the most thrilling or complex of psychological puzzles, the end is rather simple, yet very satisfying, and it thankfully does not go the artistic route and come up with some preposterous twist ending.This is not a movie for everyone, but it's a fine piece of cinema and deserves to be seen.

Potpurri sounds like too light and fluffy a name to give to this flambouyant and diverse selection of tech house tracks by two of the best rerubbers in all of electronic music. Gabor Schablitski and Soren Bodner are the Wignomy Brothers, and Gabor also works alone under the alias Robag Wruhme. Most of the tracks are remixed courtesy of Robag, who seems to be the more active member of the Wighnomy Brothers. He's been busy long after this album remixing current tracks like Matthias Tanzmann's Bulldozer and Ellen Allien and Apparat's new track Way Out (you gotta hear this one).Here we have a dozen tracks and I only disliked two of them, one was track 2, with it's dreadful, cheesy techno vocals, and track 10, Alter Ego's Daktari, simply because Robag added in a constant loop of someone clearing their throat! It continues throughout nearly every part of the track and it's very, very annoying. I don't think coughing is meant to be a pleasurable sound in any form of music. Look for the Matt John or the Ricardo Villalobos remixes, both which are excellent takes on this track. That's about the only track you can say that someone other than Robag remixed it and made it sound better.As for the rest of the CD, it's an incredible array of minimal, techno, tech house, soulful vocals, reggae style vocals, and your never sounding the same remixes of some great tracks. Robag ends the CD with an exclusive track of his own, which is a hard hitting breaks track.Also on here is what I consider to be one of the top 5 best remixes of all time in the electronic world: the Wighnomy Bros. and Robag Wruhme Bukkelflipps Remix of This World by Slam featuring Tyrone Palmer. If you listen to the original, it's worlds away, and they certainly made this one otherworldly, and it's going down as a classic slice of tech house history. From the ee-choo-uhn vocal snippet, to the rubbery horns building in and out, to the scorching hot breaks, this is has been one of the hottest tracks in house/breakbeat/tech house, crossing multiple genre barriers and rising to the top of 'em all. The remix on here has the vocals by Tyrone Palmer, which were chopped down and far less than the original single. There is also their dub, not found on here, which leaves out all the vocals, and I usually prefer that one, even though the vocals are good. It just sounds slick getting to enjoy all the perks of the track vocal free.Aside from the Slam track, my hot pick on here is the buzzing remix of Pascal FEOS's Tanzbombe. It's a brooding track full of dark energy. You really can't go wrong with this cd, apart from a cough and an oddball male vocal track (#2). It's a must buy if you are a tech house fan. It's a very hard to find CD, and any CD releases with just remixes on them are few and far between already. Get it while you can!

However, if you are a fan of this entire film series by Truffaut, then you should spring for the Adventures of Antoine Doinel boxed set. It comes with all the extras found on this disc, plus a bonus disc which features excerpts from a 1961 documentary on Truffaut, which touches on this film, and a promotional art gallery for this film. Neither of these bonus features are found on this disc, nor is the bonus short film, Antoine and Colette, which is on the 400 Blows' disc in the boxed set. Great if you only want this movie, but I'd pay the extra dough as it's well worth it to have the entire Criterion boxed set, which is loaded with extras covering all the other films.

There's a reason GU must have picked Tony for the first of their now 9 year running series: he was a mixmaster at the top of his game back in 1996. I am not sure there was a better DJ in the late 90's than De Vit. He spun hard house, with only a smidgen of trance and progressive stuff, so all the reviewers who constantly smear Tony's 2 CD's as the worst of the GU series are just ignorant to his sound or don't prefer it over prog. house/trance.Let's also note that his mix WAS recorded live in a club in Tel Aviv, unlike the rest of the GU mixes to follow, which were all studio mixed and edited through computers. You hear no crowd noise because it was recorded straight from the turntables to a DAT recorder. There was also no editing done afterward. Basing the mix on that alone, there isn't a DJ in sight who could mix tracks like these (150+ BPMs) as perfect as Tony did. He had been DJ'ing for 15 years prior to this, so it's no wonder he had perfected the craft.As far as the other GU's, only Dave Seaman's incredible Cape Town trance mix compares to this one in terms of sheer perfection in a 2 disc set. I do have to say that Tony's Tokyo mix was unfortunately not as sound as this one, as the track selection was nowhere near as good as Tel Aviv. It's still a good mix, but not up to the heights this one gets to.It all started here GU fans, and while some of you may prefer GU's 2-27 better than this one (barring Tokyo) one must admit that in terms of mixing, track selection (for this genre), and an ecstatic energy level never to be met again in the new millenium, this one is most certainly the best.

The background music is sweet, but the lyrics are dreadful. There's nothing wrong with her voice, the song just doesn't flow well. This has to be the worst single released by 4 Strings to date. I was eagerly awaiting their new CD, and still am, however their first choice for a single was not a good one. Let's hope the new album is not more of this. Don't pass up their CD Believe if you don't already have it. It has to be in the top 25 dance/trance albums of all time.

Typical Rohmer character study of an engaged man reassuring himself that while he is at the moment "still free", he is not in the least bit interested in any other women. During a vacation, a friend introduces him to a woman with 2 teenage daughters (17-19 years-old). Our main character spends the first half of the film convincing himself and others that he is quite comfortable with his fiancee and needs no one else, however finds himself drawn to the younger daughter. The 2nd half of the film finds him suddenly attracted to the other daughter, and developing an obsession with touching her knee, which he sees her boyfriend doing. By the end of the film, he achieves this goal and that's it, our little Rohmer moral tale is over.Not very unlike his other films, however the characters and dialogue were not as interesting and compelling to watch as those in films such as My Night at Maud's, A Tale of Springtime, Boyfriends and Girlfriends, Chloe in the Afternoon, and Summer. All of these films I noted, I wouldn't mind repeated viewings, however once was enough with Claire's Knee. I feel this is one of his films that does not stand the test of time too well, as much as the others do. The morals in his other films were more intense and attention grabbing, but this one borders on almost not caring about this guy's situation at all.As for the DVD quality, yes, we know what to expect from Fox/Lorber, however it is not as bad as other reviewers state. The opening scenes start out with tons of artifacting, but that quickly gets better moments into the film. The audio is clear and I found the picture was sharper than Chloe in the Afternoon. This is still slightly above VHS quality, where Chloe was really not.

When this creepy anthology series first debuted on Region 2 DVD back in 2005, I knew I wanted to eventually purchase it, and it was a great deal in getting all 4 seasons in one boxed set. I never got around to buying it, figuring I would see if it would ever surface on Region 1. Well, it has, and for more money than I can buy all 4 seasons, we only get the first season? ARGH! You'd spend a small fortune collecting these! Since cheap DVD players can easily be changed to multi region these days, for the price you will have to pay to get the entire series on Region 1 discs, you could spend far less buying a new DVD player, the Region 2 boxed set, and still have money left over for a few seasons of some other television show. Ridiculous how we get rooked in the US, and it's a UK show.

Those not familiar with the Trance Nation series out of Germany can now purchase them on Amazon starting with number 20. For some reason, the others were never available.It is a 3 disc set, with the first disc mixed by Alex M.O.R.P.H. and the 2nd by Heller & Enkie. Disc 3 is an unmixed collection of full length tracks!!While 20 does not have as many superb tracks as 19 did (which was incredible) there are some standouts here. Changes by Inner State (with Tiff Lacey of ATB's Ecstasy fame) is here in two forms, one on the uncut disc 3 (with the superb John O'Callaghan mix) and the original mix on the 2nd mix CD. Endre's instrumental new stunner I Kill for You is on the mix cd in the form of the unbelievable Probspot remix, and on the full length disc in Original Mix. These are the two best tracks in this set.You get Racheal Starr's Til there was You in trance form (Gabriel & Dresden) and in House form (John Creamer vs. Stephanie K. mix). Kyau vs. Albert is featured on here a lot, with their remixes of Find and Jump the Next Train, and their own superb instrumental, Falling Anywhere, as well as their Hard Dub of Made of Sun.The track that finishes off Heller & Enkie's mix CD is Harry Lemon's exclusive Trance Nation remix of I Found You by Interstate. It turns the groovy original tune into a dark, fast driving track. Well worth a listen to it and the entire set. One stinky bomb of a track is Heller & Enkie's own female vocal track, So Many Times. It's quite cheesy and features very bad, awkward sounding vocals. Skip this one quick!!

I say light, as the tension of the murder mystery toward the end, is in this reviewers opinion, handled almost lightheartedly, or without the normal tension and mist surrounding characters normally associated in your typical Hollywood crime thriller. This merely lies out the underpinnings of what will consequently be revealed.Charlotte Rampling gives a blazing peformance and you feel cheated when she is not on screen. However, Ludivine Sagnier strolling about in striking bikinis (and occasionally nude) may take your mind off Rampling for a few moments. Ludivine's girlish, choppy, French accent discourages from what could have been a prime performance. I don't think any Hollywood actress would have been better suited in this role, however an exotic French actress who was more articulate in English may have.The cinematography and slow moving plot pace reminds one of an Eric Rohmer film, however the comparisons stop there. In a Rohmer film, personal relationships and virtues are more deeply explored.A fun journey around a swimming pool in France, I recommend this one due to it's lush visuals and a stunning perfomance from Charlotte Rampling.NOTE: Hit the 'Menu' button on the DVD remote when the "WARNING" notice first comes up on screen as soon as you put the disc in. This will take you right to the Main Menu. If you miss doing this on the warning screen, then the menu button is deactivated and you must fast forward through 7 minutes of previews.

I'm kind of at a loss, because there are some exceptional tracks on here: the stunning new Oceanlab track, Sirens of the Sea, which offers up a great Balearic remix by Kyau vs. Albert; the new A&B;/Andy Moor track Air for Life, which gives you a decent Airwave mix (but I would seek out the even better Mirco De Govia remix); and a new version of Made of Sun by KvA made especially for this CD, that adds the original track's lost verses of vocals they dropped from their Hard Dub. And just about all the rest of the CD is decent, melodic stuff, but none of it really stands out too much or flows all that well. It's not too fast, not too slow, and it's not bad, but it's not exceptional.The CD tends to just play and then it's over. It's hard to explain it further, but when I compare it to other trance mix CD's I currently have, this one has to be put at the bottom of my playlist, because it's just not moving enough. One track I really don't care for is the Carrie Skipper vocal track, Time Goes By.If you don't believe me, just go and buy these other CD's and tell me they don't all blow this one away in terms of pace, theme, and energy:Miami '05-Markus SchulzTechoclub Next2-Talla 2XLC & Kyau Vs. AlbertBack to Back Vol. 2-Cosmic GateFor You-Johan GielenI guess I expected much more from these guys, after all, their 2004 Essential Mix was a bar to which other sets must be judged. They don't even come close to it with this mix.I really like Above & Beyond, but this CD is not up to snuff. I would still consider purchasing it though, as it is not a bad listen at all, and just getting the new Oceanlab track is practially worth the price alone.

This is the question Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Leaud) keeps asking all the male characters in the film, trying to find the meaning of women, as he hopes to figure out his own relationship with the script-girl, who has just been found kissing the movie's stills guy. Ahhh, but then he finds the luscious Jacqueline Bisset, who is at odds and struggling with her own relationship with a wealthy older American. While this movie is about making movies, it still revisists Truffaut's main theme in most of his films: the relationships between men and women.A brilliant movie by a brilliant director (the best, actually). The opening one minute tracking shot of the "movie within the movie" emptiomizes Truffaut's own unique style: a bus zooms by as we seemingly focus on the main character? A woman dressed in red walking a busy street? No.... an elderly couple walking their dog? No... Jean-Pierre Leaud coming up the steps of a subway stop? No... a red convertible pulling up and parking? Still no... but alas, after nearly one full minute of the camera looping around this busy Parisian street, we finally land on the intended main character of the scene, Jean-Pierre Aumont, as he gets slapped by an approaching Jean-Pierre Leaud. This opening sequence sets the tone for a truly original film about film.I love the camera style of Truffaut, where either at the beginning of a scene, or in most cases after it, he will pan off of the main characters or action, and sneakingly dwell on some other non-significant character or scenery.Even though we don't make movies like they used to in 1972, this is still a fascinating look into the movie making world of the time, with all it's facets, responsiblities, and relationships. Very humorous at times, it is a true pleasure to sit back and enjoy this Oscar winning film, from a director who is unequaled in the history of films.

Is it Solarstone, or Solar Stone? I've seen it more as two words, but here it's one word so maybe that is the right way. Anyway, if you are familiar with the Baeleric trance duo known as Solarstone, you know they are an expert at selecting, re-editing, and putting out some of the best trance of their own. Some of you may recall their Chill Out Euphoria CD, which brought chill/ambient trance to a whole new level, splicing and meshing their own sounds with re-edits of nearly every track. They also mixed disc 2 of the 1st Lost Language Exhibition CD mix, which is well worth finding if you don't have it already.Again, they turn to their editing and mixing skills and come up with a very fresh sounding 2 disc set. Even if you see a track you've heard for months on here, it will sound refreshed, as they've had a hand in tweaking probably every track on here. I had heard Ronski Speed's 2Day a little too much lately, but managed to WANT to hear it all the way through again in this mix, just because it's amazing how Solarstone can spruce it up with just some slight re-editing. You'll also hear slight elements of some tracks, up to two tracks prior, before getting to that track full force.You get a solid mix of some vocal trance, Balaeric trance, melodic trance, and some high energy stuff. I found disc 2 to be more solid all the way through, but you really can't go wrong or find a bad spot on either of these discs. I'm going with 4 stars because disc 1, although expertly mixed, just didn't have a good flow from top to bottom.

How can anyone in their right mind want to remake this classic? How about remaking Star Wars, Gone with the Wind, or ET. You just don't touch the classic stuff, it's taboo. This is classic British humour at it's finest. An unbelievable cast, with Sellers, Herbert Lom, Katie Johnson, and the truly remarkable Alec Guiness. These motley group of theives and thugs up against one little kind tea-making British lady is hilarious just in premise. Watching it is like stepping back into time, with all those classic British cars, but you are also stepping into a timeless comedic experience.

I will say right off that if you are looking for a mob/action/revenge/shoot 'em up thriller, this surely isn't the picture you're looking for. Despite it's slick trailer, which makes it seem like it may be a violent revenge flick, it really has no action, gunfights, or fisticuffs. What made this film work for me was the tense pace of the film. It really drove me to it's final few minutes in just as quick a time as if there were action scenes galore.For the first 90 minutes, we get a very different Clive Owen than the one on the DVD cover. We get the unkempt, unshaven, drifter he has been for 3 years, until he tries to contact his younger brother, and finds he has committed suicide due to a heinous crime inflicted against him. You only get the clean cut Clive for the final 10 minutes, but it's an effective transformation, and I didn't mind it coming so late.Each player involved in this setting is shown contemplating the events about to unfold. Will (Clive Owen) strolls back into London, meets back up with his old girl (Charlotte Rampling), ensues fear in the rival crime boss, and gets a visit from his old gang mates. While a lot of the aspects never fully conclude, it's quite alright as the film succeeds in merely showing their developments, which are just as intriguing as if all loose ends were tied. The film's score and cinematography play a big part in this, as well as credible performances by all involved.

27 years for US fans, as it was released a year ago in a UK/Region 2 set, and now finally gets a Region 1 release. As a Dr. Who fan, I would always read and hear about this very obscure Scottish show dealing with the paranormal and starring Louise Jameson (Leela in Doctor Who) and involving several others behind the scenes who also worked on Who over it's long run (George Gallaccio, Anthony Read, Peter Grimwade, Anthony Read, Paddy Russell, Norman Stewart, Kenny McBain).Unlike the 26 straight years that Doctor Who ran, The Omega Factor only ran one season. Due to budget constraints of this sci-fi show, the normal run of 13 episodes had to be chopped down to only 10, futher adding to the cult status of this very short lived program. The other factor that adds to the mystique of the show was that it had never been re-run, and never released on video until now. I attempted to track down bootleg copies of the show, but the mystery was still upheld when I would try to play the dreadful quality, multi generation copy in my VCR and found that it was virtually unwatchable. The only way bootleg tapes were floating around was that someone in 1979 must have had a VCR and taped it, and so started the poor generation copies that floated around through the years.Even this DVD release shows signs of poor quality orginals, especially evidence in episode 1, with lots of artifacts, grain, and all sorts of weird interference showing up on screen. After episode 1, the clarity is better and remains a decent quality throughout the other episodes. You get an informative booklet accompanying the set, and the extras include commentary by the writer, director, and producer on the show's most controversial episode, Powers of Darkness, and a 24 minute documentary with the same 3 as the commentary and one cast member. That cast member is the series' writers' daughter, Natasha Gerson, who played the minor, but effective character, Morag. Sadly, lead actor James Hazeldine passed away in 2002, and it appears they could not get Louise Jameson for any extras on here. Both the commentary and the bonus documentary are interesting and worth a listen/look.The show starts off with journalist Tom Crane (Hazeldine), who apparently has paranormal tendencies including psychokineses and psychic ability. He meets the mysterious Dr. Drexel and soon has a terrible accident involving his wife. After this tragedy, he is recruited by Andrew Scott-Erskine, head of Department 7, a government agency involved in utilizing and researching the paranormal. He reluctantly joins, after finding a friend of his, Anne Reynolds (Jameson) is also a member, and is now working under the head of the Glasgow branch, Dr. Roy Martindale (John Carlisle).Department 7 is very intersted in the enhanced mental powers of the mysterious Dr. Drexel. Over the first 4 episodes and against orders, Tom also attempts to seek out Drexel and his odd, young, female comanion Morag, believing they are responsible for his wife's accident. That plot ends, in a way, after the 4th episode, but Tom does not find out what he is looking for, and continues his belief through the rest of the series, that there is a secret organization working around Department 7.Tom's brother also has psychic abilities and is quickly gobbled up by Dr. Martindale for experimenting. We learn later on that his part in all this is bigger than we first believed. Many secrets are unveiled in the show's final 2 episodes, but there is still a slight hint of what we are seeing not being entirely the finale. A 2nd season could definitley have proved intersting.The special effects are very low budget (e.g. people glowing blue and white) but effective enough as we are dealing with mind experiments and powers that need not be expressed in elaborate explosions and 3-D holograms. The fact that it was shot on videotape (standard in the UK for tv shows in the 70's), and the outdoor scenes filmed in Edinburgh, add to the eerie look and feel of the show. I highly recommend watching this at night, to get a complete creepy, audio and visual effect. It isn't very scary, it's just rather unearthly and bizarre. I am not a firm believer in the paranormal, and usually prefer my sci-fi to be spaceship based shows, but I found this very enjoyable. I think the strong performance of James Hazeldine and Louise Jameson helped out a lot. The show is slow moving, and generally dialogue based, and these two make the time roll by with ease.This was Louise Jameson's next role after playing Tom Baker's leather clad, savage companion Leela from 1977-78. While I am a big Who fan, and loved her character in that show, I must say I found her much more entertaining as a modern (well, then modern) women in normal street attire and persona. Even though she did not have skimpy costumes on, I felt she looked classy and even more attractive than she did in Who. James Hazeldine gives a very wam, and likable performance as Tom Crane, and he would go on to to star in the Chocky series of movies on UK TV. Despite his 70's buhsy hair and Jameson's large, Elton John like sunglasses, the 70's look does not detract from their on screen chemistry and the watchability of this show.Out of the 10 episodes, I felt two were rather weak, the first being Child's Play, which seem very contrived in that Anne asks Tom to spend a weekend with her at her friend's house, and they find that her friend's son has been having strange dreams and visions. The other was episode Out of Body, Out of Mind, dealing with a Tom's brother recovering from Department 7's experiments. This one was just boring and a very slow moving lead in to the show's final episodes and plot revelations.Overall, this is well worth watching to the sci-fi fan, 70's British TV fan, Doctor Who fan, and paranormal fan. It features strong performances, very intersting plots and phenomenon, and very ghostly and formidable Scottish location as it's setting. It's a shame that UK broadcast campaigner, Mary Whitehouse, leading a charge against the witchcraft and mind controlling going on in the show, especially after watching the Powers of Darkness episode involving summoning a burned at the stake witch on a ouija board, played a part in the show not getting a 2nd season.The show has come back, in a way, in the guise of Sea of Souls, a recent BBC Scotland effort, invloving a University research team conducting experiments and research into the paranormal. It is nearly the same premise, it just leaves out the government playing a role, and it comes from the viewpoint of them as solely researchers. It's aired for 3 seasons, and I am not sure if it's going on for a 4th, but it's worth a look if you like The Omega Factor and can play multi region discs.On a final note, as the crew recollects strange occurrences on the set during filming, I seemed to have some odd things happen while watching this. It's probably all in my mind, but I seemed to have difficutly locating the discs and or box case, after watching an episode, as I would swear I set it down in one location, then it would be somewhere totally different when I searched for it. Also, when watching a few episodes, it may just be my DVD player, but I swear I would see some sort of glitch or millisecond of a scene that was different from what I was watching, then I would hit reverse and play it again, and the glitch would be gone! A very strange and mysterious side effect I have here from watching this show!

Disc 1 is what Armin is known for, and what he is an expert at mixing, current trance trends mixed with supreme female vocal trance. Tracks 1-4 are some of the best female vocal trance the genre has to offer. The rest of the CD has some very jazzy trance, which is where the trance scene has been lingering in lately. Groovy, jazzed up beats, but never sounding too housey. This disc is just as good as the many superb live sets I've heard Armin play lately. While the mixing is top notch, my one gripe is when track 3's melody lingers over the beginning main vocals of track 4, which I am not a fan of this type of transition.Disc 2 is simply in a whole other realm, delving into some sort of bad techno blitz that I can't even begin to tell you how bad and how NOT trancey this is. Tracks 1-6 were a pure nightmare to listen to, and the CD does save a little face getting to Gabriel & Dresden on track 7. Looking toward the end of the CD, I figured it would perk up a bit with Blank & Jones and Kyay vs. Albert ending things off, however the E-Craig mix of Perfect Silence is nowhere near the best mix of this track, and Armin's own special re-edit of Kyau vs. Albert's own Hard Dub of Made of Sun does nothing for it, in fact I feel it cheapens it.I was not a fan of State of Trance 2004, as it only had a few exceptional tracks, and the rest was, shall we call in Star Wars terminology, Bantha fodder. The same is with this set, although the one great thing about it is you only need to use Disc 1, as all the good stuff is on there.I have to end up with 3 stars, because disc 1 is 5 stars, and I couldn't even call Disc 2 a 1 star, so the average is a 3 star rating. If you want some much better 2 disc trance sets, go for Markus Schulz-Miami '05, or ATB's DJ In the Mix Vol. 2 (German only import) as they have many more tracks grazing across 2 discs than this one. Armin should have stuck to a 1 disc mix and he would have had near perfection.Other 1 disc mixes out now to consider: Positive Ways 4 by Kyau vs. Albert, and For You by Johan Gielen.

Armin must have had either a field day, carving up all these great tunes from the past year, or a nightmare having to get through them all. Tough to say how his time went mixing it, but what he produced is a great 2 disc set, with a year's worth of trance on it. Apparently, these 82 tracks were selected by the listeners of his State of Trance weekly radio show. Apparently, the fans missed out on a lot of great tracks, which I will get to in a moment.I think everyone who enjoys this music should have this disc, as it's a fun ride that you can just let play anywhere, anytime, and you're bound to hear tons of great snippets of tracks you loved from the past year. If there's something you didn't care for too much, don't worry, as it will be over in probably 45 seconds! The tracks range from about 40 seconds to no more than 3 minutes (and even that long is a rarity). Tracks often play through 1 or two others, but it never sounds messy, and he seems to use all the juicy spots of the tracks, which makes both discs have a very uplifting energy to them. Lots of melodies and lots of vocals, so there's something for everyone.Now for the two reasons I don't give this 5 stars: first, each disc is only 1 hour long. 20 minutes more worth of tracks could have been added to each disc, which at the track length times of the tracks, could have come out to 10-15 more tracks per disc. If you are going to go all out like this, why not fill both discs? Especially since we get to my next gripe: there were some HUGE tracks from 2005 inexplicably missing from this mix. Here they are, going from bottom to the top of the list of "why the heck weren't they on here"?!?!?!10. Solace - Lustral (just about every mix of this track was hot)9. Sansibar - Nic Chagall presents Encee8. Gran Rey - Markus & Brian7. Celestial - Brisky6. I Found You - Interstate (The Harry Lemon remix, and the incredible Harry Lemon Trance Nation exclusive mix both came out in 2005, even though the original track was out in 2004).5. The Unknown - Whitewater feat. Melinda Gareh (one of the top female vocal tracks of the year)4. Flash - Johan Gielen3. Asarja - Ronski Speed and Mirco De Govia2. Call it a Day - E- Craig (the most explosive track of the year; how on Earth did this one slip through??)1. Made of Sun - Kyau vs. Albert (if all the above 9 were missing, but this one was there, I still would have given it 5 stars, but forgetting this one nearly loses 2 stars alone -- WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED HERE????)What I think may have happened is that fans forgot about early 2005, as a lot of the above list is early 2005 releases. Oh well, what we have is still an awesome trance experience. He should do this every year; I'll buy it!!

Disc 1 comprises of Tony's own produced tracks from the 90's and it's a great collection of some classic, never dull, never dated sounding, fast thumping, high energy dance music. Most of these tracks could still move a dance floor today and sound very fresh and lively. Tony's last finished track, the Dawn, is one of his few trancier sounding production efforts, and it would have been very interesting to see where his musical talents would have taken him, had he not passed away so prematurely. Burning Up, To the Limit, and Are You All Ready are classic tracks of his reigning king of hard house era.Disc 2 is a collection of remixes he made for various house artists of that era. Kicking off this disc are tunes that are not very fresh sounding by today's standards, and more mainstream house than the usualy De Vit hard house sound. Tracks 1-5 are quite uneventful, but then things pick up with the classic "Hooked" by 99th Floor Elevators, and keep going with a few more flavorful house tunes. Track 9 finally gets us back into some slammin' hard house again which continues through the rest of this disc.One track of note is Tony's superb Remix of Age Of Love by Age of Love. He puts a masterful hard house spin on this classic trance tune, and according to the CD liner notes, the record label didn't like his remix and never used it. It's only available on this CD and was never before released. A few other DJ's such as Marco V are coming out with new mixes of this classic 14-year-old dance track, but Tony's is bar far the best I've heard.We end off with probably Tony's best remix, of Louise's Naked, which is also the most mainstream sounding dance track he's put his spin on. It's one hell of a spin, with a fast, fast BPM thrill ride that has to be one of the best sounding remixes I've ever heard. The original song was a decent dance hit, and Tony's high adrenaline remix is simply incredible!One odd note about this 2 disc set is that it's a continuous mix with rather abrupt transitions between tracks, and not much of a mixing effort, expecially on disc 1. I think this best of compilation should definitely have been layed out as separate tracks. Age of Love mixing well into Naked certainly should have been left apart. These tracks needed to be left perfectly in full mix form, on their own.Overall, a highly recommended piece of techno/electronica/dance/hard house history. And it's one slice of history that just keeps on slammin'...R.I.P. Tony

If you thought they couldn't repeat again with another trance stunner like Ace, think again, as Ian Van Dahl is back with a superb freakin' vengeance! Believe, Where Are You Now, and I Can't Let You Go have all been officially released as singles, but the offerings do not stop here, as there are even more awesome tracks to behold on this album!!!There isn't a bad track on here, with all the background trance melodies being incredibly danceable and catchy. If there is one flaw I have is that some of the choruses of the vocals are a bit repetitive, like in Crying and My Own.This is hands down the best mainstream danceable trance album of 2004. It completely kicks butt over 4 Strings album Turn It Around which was released the same day.And as for the best track on here, it is definitely track 8-Do You Feel the Same. This is slightly different type of dance style track that you can't hear and immediately say Ian Van Dahl, like you can with their other tracks. It's a knockout track and if they don't release it as a single they are nuts!!!Run, don't walk to the nearest store, or press the buy it now button on amazon immediately and get overnight shipping because nobody should be without this slammin trance album right now!!

Apart from the 2 opening tracks, which I didn't care for, the rest of this CD is solid. The first track is ok, but features some odd sounding vocals that are a little off. The 2nd is from the usually always reliable Ronski Speed, but I feel this track sounds a little too much like some early 80's electro. The Ronski Speed remix is the better version, but even that isn't much to speak of. The cd follows with 3 good house sounding vocal tracks, until getting back into trance with an excellent Ronski Speed track, 2Day. More Ronski Speed in his collaboration with Mirco De Govia on the track Asarja, which has been spun by every major trance DJ this year.2 solid instrumentals are next, with the Kyau vs. Albert remix of Jump the Next Train following. It's a hot remix, and there were several versions of this song played all year, and all of them were nothing short of spectacular. The now overplayed Find by Ridgewalkers checks in with the less often played but solid KvA remix. One of the best trance tracks of the year follows, Kyau vs. Albert's own Made of Sun (in the form of an exclusive Positive Ways re-dit), and the CD closes with 3 good trance instrumentals.As a bonus, you get a 2nd CD featuring remixes of KvA's 2 smash hits this year, with the following tracklisting:1 Made of Sun (Album Edit)2 Falling Anywhere (Rework Edit)3 Made of Sun (KvA Hard Dub Edit)4 Falling Anywhere (Rework)5 Made of Sun (KvA Hard Dub)Some vocal trance, house, instrumental trance, and a bonus CD featuring their hot vocal track, Made of Sun, and their instrumental track, Falling Anywhere, which were 2 of the best tracks of the year. This one is highly recommended. if you want an even better Kyau vs. Albert mix, the CD is called TechnoClub Next2, and it features Talla 2XLC on disc 1, and Kyau vs. Albert on disc 2. It's my pick for 2nd best trance mix of the year. It has only been available in Germany, unless US Amazon decides to stock it. One last note is that Positive Ways 4 seemed to take ages to reach US Amazon, as I had bought this one early in '05 from Germany.

Tilt's been on the progressive scene now for several years, and here they've come up with an artist album of varying styles. Trance, breakbeat, techno, downtempo, house, it's all here, and they've done a decent job. Artist albums in any musical style can never be solid all the way through, as it's not like a mix album where you can take the best of the best tracks and splice them all together. I think electronic fans are spoiled and use to mixes chock-filled with anthems from top to bottom, so they are very hard on artist albums.I only dislike 3 tracks on here, Venus in Transit, Antivalentine and Crescendo. Tracks like 12, Goodbye, and The World Doesn't Know are all current trance anthems, and Control Me is a fantastic vocal track. A New Day is rather pop-like, but it's a very catchy pop like song and I like it a lot. There's much to like on here, and while I said I disliked only 3, there are a few average ones like Explorer and Electronic Poledancer, but listenable nonetheless.Overall, a very above average artist album and one every Tilt fan should definitley own, and every other trance fan should consider owning. Also check out fellow label mate Probspot's new artist album.

Starting out with the Intro track, Blue Tubes, the pace of this CD takes right off and never comes back down again, through all 24 tracks. I must start by saying this is a much better mix and track selection than his last effort, Coldharbour Sessions. I skipped many tracks on that set, and the pace and theme wasn't steady enough to keep my attention. On Miami, out of the 24 tracks, I am lucky if I choose to skip 2 tracks; that's it!While Coldharbour Sessions was very melodic, slower, and somewhat spacey electro dreariness in some parts, this mix serves up some of the hottest sounding, fast, pulsating progressive trance currently on offer. Yes, there are a few tracks duplicated from Armin's far inferior, State of Trance 2005, but Schulz's mix is much better. The track I Know You're Gone on Miami does not have the melody from the previous track hovering in the background when the vocals kick in, as it does on Armin's CD.Electro Hairspray, the only track of his own, is a very cool jazzed up trance track (the current trend) with a swooshing effect that definitely sounds like one is pressing an old aerosol can of hair spray (now defunct due to the ozone)! Markus has an excellent new female vocal track out now, First Time, which is questionably missing from these discs. It appears on Armin's State of Trance 2005 though. Weird.An absolute must have trance mix for '05. VERY FEW 2 disc sets in recent years can keep your attention through them both, but this one has certainly passed the test.

Let me start by saying that if you don't like French films where there is no action and it's mostly just dialogue amongst the leads in a few different indoor/outdoor settings, then don't look here. However, if you find Eric Rohmer films, and French films that are very "talky" engaging, then this is one of the better ones.The leads in this films all give wonderful performances and while I don't like every Rohmer film, I liked this one a lot. Even though it is all talking throughout, the conversations and script kept me intrigued and I found the movie flew buy in a good way (normally talky pictures seem to drag on and on).The plot is basically a beautiful 18-year-old French girl (the redhead on the DVD cover) meets a late 20's/early 30's girl at a party where they are both bored and become friends. The 18-year-old despises her late 30's/early 40's father's girlfriend and believes that if she puts her new friend togther with her dad, he will fall for her and forget his fiancee. That's basically it, but the characters keep you focused and quite interested in their simple interactions.The settings are plain, but rather nice-looking French decor. Even though it's a late 80's film, I didn't see much in it to make you think you were in that time frame. A film that looks very fresh today. Also, the MGM-World Films line does a much better job of the transfer than the rest of Rohmer's films, which are done by the folks at Fox/Lorber. The picture quality is far superior and you can change and remove the subtitles (unlike the Lorber films which are burned in).

The Trancemaster series has been around all decade, and the designation they are using now, 4007, is the latest one as of this writing. They seem to be pumping these out one every 2-3 months, and it's an awesome series featuring all the hottest and latest trance tracks, unmixed and full length! If you like plucking tracks to upload to your portable digital media players, this is one of the best CD series I know to get all full tracks, without having to find them all to download from several different trance label websites.Each release seems to be very consistent: you will get at at least 7-10 major anthems that will be played by every DJ in the present and coming months; about 5-8 decent to above average tracks that won't get much DJ play; and about 4 or 5 tracks that are passable to not very good. Nearly all of the tracks are instrumentals, with each one only featuring only about 2 vocal tracks.The question is, is it worth the price to you as it is pretty steep to buy here on Amazon, or to buy directly from Germany. You certainly can't buy every one, so it's best to look over the tracks and determine what appeals to you. I picked up 4004 and 4007, but skipped over 4005 & 4006, because a lot of the tracks I had on other comps and mixes, and the rest of the tracks didn't stadout as much. Both 4004 and 4007 I am very pleased with. I will list a full tracklist, but let me get to some of the tracks on these CD's: I Need You by Jose Amnesia vs. Fedo is a great melodic start to the CD. Track 2 isn't so hot, as it's not a very good mix of Dark Side of the Moon. The vocals are poorly arranged, and the main chorus, which makes the track very likeable, is taken out. Look for the original or the dance floor stomping Dogzilla remix. DJ Tatana is on here twice (one on each disc), and both her tracks are awesome, genre defining instrumentals, with Highway being the better one. The other three standouts on disc 1 are Celestial by Brisky (my favorite on this entire CD); the track Melodica (which is soooo aptly named); and Adrenaline, by Purple Haze, which is FULL of trance adrenaline and being spun by EVERY big DJ right now.CD 2 starts off with a bang too, with Widescreen by First and Andre. The always reliable Ron Van Den Beuken comes out with another hit, Sunset, which features more of his now trademarked, thunderous beats. Stoneface & Terminal's Sidewinder is also great, and it's the Arc in the Sky remix is featured on here, but every mix of this track I've heard is sweet. I've noticed that this series seems to put lesser known artists and below average tracks in the last 3 slots, but two out of the last 3 tracks on disc 2 feature Lange & Marcos, so there's no slouching at the end of this one.Well, it's your choice, but in my opinion, there are certain Trancemasters I needed to have, and this is one of them.Tracklist:CD11) I Need You (Dub Mix) Jose Amnesia vs. Fedo2) Dark Side of the Moon (Viframa Remix) - Ernesto vs. Bastian3) Electro Classic - DJ Tatana4) Celestial (JOC pres.

A quote from Huppert's character may lead some insight as to what dangerous emotions are brewing inside the minds of two eccentric women, who become the deadliest of friends. It's like two ticking time bombs not going off on their own, until they are brought together. What happens when these two become acquainted, does not bode well for the upper class French family who took Bonnaire's character in as a maid.I say ticking time bombs, as there was certainly something in each of these women's past. Something evil fell upon both of them alone, and the question is, which one of them were responsible for deaths occuring in their past, and which one was accident, or were they both no accident?A lot of these questions do not get answered in this tension building shocker. The entire film is a set-up for the last few minutes, where Jacqueline Bisset and family are subject to first hand violence that can occur when these two ladies get together.Although Chabrol had another film called The Color of Lies, the hidden secrets in this film seem to outnumber the ones in that one. It's a slow building but entertaining film, full of mystery, great performances, and a shocking ending. If you enjoy this, I would also view Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat) which I found it to be an even better film, with Huppert bringing tension to the lives of another upper class French family, this time, from the inside!

This is not a collection of Martin's photographs, but a collection of photographs he collects. They are all taken from brochures and paraphernalia, depicting tacky scenes and settings of a romantic nature. If you liked his book on Christmas cards, this is a similar offering of reprints of these photos, appearing to be mostly taken in the 60's and 70's. Not as exciting as the nostalgic look into Butlin's Holiday camps, in Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight, but still a quirky read nonetheless.

Suzanne's new single is even better than her last house anthem, Luv 2 Luv. The Beat Hustlerz remix (track 1-radio edit; track 2-club mix) is getting played everywhere and is a bona fide smash, however, I suggest moving right to track 4, which is the Offer Nissim Mix part 2. It gives the track a slight vocal rearrangement in one spot, and slips in a dark, super fast, driving bassline. A dance floor simply appears in front of you when you hear this one! While the Beat Hustlerz mix is pure mainstream, club bliss, the killer Offer Nissim Mix #2 makes that version sound like slow moving kiddie fare! Offer Nissim Mix 1 (track 3) is ok, and nearly the same as Mix 2, but the rhythm and bassline are slighly off. It's just not that smooth sounding. Avoid the last two tracks, the Luv 2 Luv remixes, as they offer nothing to that classic.

Nick Warren's 6th Global Underground release is the best one yet, and should go down as one of the best of all the GU series. He started with some funky trance (Prague), moved into some harder, progressive trance (Budapest, Amsterdam, Brazil), then most recently into some quirky progressive house (Reykjavik). Reykjavik was not my style at all, but the superb Way Out West artist album released last year brought Nick back to my attention very quickly, and the bonus mix CD from Don't Look Now was just the tip of the iceberg of what is to come with GU#28, Shanghai.It starts off slow, just like that last mix, and slowly brings you uptempo until the beats begin to tear as we get into one of the best tracks on CD1-Over It by Tini Tun. Nick has assembled tracks from artists all over the world for this mix, but you wouldn't know it as the steady beats, and generous melodies all seem to come together perfectly on the 2 discs. Attention to theme definitely played a big part here, as the entire CD 1 is an incredible journey from start to finish, and it's STILL only a taste of what is to come with the even better CD2.CD2 wastes no time pumping the BPM's and we get some nice vocal tracks early on, then a steady mix of dance floor stomping progressive house tracks and some breakbeat follow. The pace never lets up until the last track, where you finally get a breather.Much more danceable and consistently faster than either Reykjavik or the Don't Look Now mix CD, this one get Nick back to true form, a dance floor filling madman on the decks!Nick Warren's best in the series and one of the best GU's you will find. I got the limited long box, which has a very nice, and very big book inside. It's worth the extra few bucks, as this one is something special. The best progressive house mix of the year!

Nick Warren's 6th Global Underground release is the best one yet, and should go down as one of the best of all the GU series.

After a disappointing Passport 2 disc trance mix, Ferry comes back with an excellent trance and house blend. Disc 1 is electro house with a smidgen of trance near the end, preparing you for the intoxicating trance of Disc 2. The track selection, mixing, and themes through both discs far surpass Passport in every aspect. If you are familiar with Benny Benassi's Satisfaction, and the several "buzz" sounding remixes he's done, it will give you an idea of the sounds and theme of disc 1. In fact, the Benassi Bros. make appearances here too.Disc 1 starts out with some very good house tracks, including the excellent male vocal opener, but when we hit tracks 5 through 9, I feel the rhythms and melodies get a bit too repetitious, but they are by no means bad. Tracks 10-14 well make up for this, as they are the best part of the mix, from the buzzing Benny Benassi house remix of Fischerspooner's Never Win, and moving into Probspot's incredible trance mix of Signalrunners' 3000 Miles Away. The trance near the end of this disc is sort of a set-up to disc 2. The only downfall is the last track, Who's Knocking. The exact same track was also on Ferry's Passport CD, so I am not sure why he included it again (he includes one other track from Passport, but a different remix). I said it when I heard it then and I am saying it now, it's a horrible track. When the female vocalist starts to belt out "Are you there, are you there" it makes me want to vomit. Luckily, you can just stop this disc one track short and not miss anything.Disc 2 starts off with a great female vocal track, Show You My World by Elles De Graaf, and kicks off what Ferry has been best known for spinning: the best pure trance out there. The track selections on Passport ranged from only about 2 superb tracks, to a bunch of mediocre stuff, to several subpar tracks. Fortunately, there isn't a dud on here, as the entire disc is a soothing journey through one of the best melodic trance mixes burned onto disc this year.A bunch of these tracks have appeared in other mixes and comps released in the past few months, but most of them are top notch, so I don't mind seeing them appear again and again (much better than putting unknown duds like he did with Passport), and he uses a few different remixes that haven't been used yet. I was blown away by track 11, Red Vision by Genix, and it's my top pick of either disc. I loved the Genix remix of Woody Van Eyden's SI-N+R-JE and had never heard of them/him prior to that, but they are now someone to watch out for, as Red Vision is pure bliss.Both Armin Van Buuren and Tiesto have tried to incorporate progressive house into their last two releases (Tiesto mixing both together on both discs, and Armin leaving most of the trance on 1 disc), and both missed the mark. Ferry along with Art of Trance have both released incredible trance and house blends this year. Check out Tales of the Unexpected by Art of Trance, as it also has house on disc 1 and trance on disc 2, but the house tracks in their mix are more progressive and darker than Ferry's electro club mix.Overall, a clear winner from Corsten, and much better than his Passport CD, which oddly only came out a short time earlier. If you like house, electro, or trance sounds, you will have something to enjoy here, and if you are a fan of Ferry's true past, spinning the best of melodic trance, you will find an incredible reward with CD 2.Oh, and my title refers to the vocal snippets from track 2 on disc 1!

If you enjoy both progressive house and trance, this will be one of your best purchases of the year. If you only like one or the other, you still should not hesitate to purchase this, as disc 1 is my 2nd best progressive house mix of this year, and disc 2 is my pick for 5th best trance mix '05 (see my listmanias).All of a sudden, the theme this year seems to be trance DJ's attempting to mix in some progressive house and new sounds into their CD releases. I am curious to know why this is suddenly occuring. Could it be that the labels do not feel they sell well enough when they stick to one genre? I find it hard to believe that so many trance DJ's suddenly stood up in the last few months and wanted to incorporate new progressive house into their mixes.Tiesto's mix was my least favorite at these new attempts with In Search of Sunrise 4, as he attempted to throw different trance styles along with progressive house onto the same CD, in the same mix. He did this on both discs, and both discs suffered. He also did not use a very good selection of tracks from either genre. Last year, Tall Paul's Live in Bulgaria was a hard house and trance blend, all on the same disc, which actually worked. Armin Van Buuren's State of Trance 2005 was all trance on disc 1, and techno and trance on disc 2, with disc 2 coming up short, but you still had a superb trance mix on disc 1.Ferry Corsten's Creamfield's incorporates electro house and trance on disc 1 (trance only on the last few tracks) and then all melodic trance on disc 2. That mix and Tales of the Unexpected are the two best examples of mixes incorporating both dance styles this year. Tales of the Unexpected features some dark, progressive house on disc 1, and progressive and melodic trance on disc 2. This mix is a clear winner in both genres. For those who prefer deeper progressive stuff over electro house, you will most likely prefer this to Ferry's.On this very unexpected Art of Trance release (which was actually out a few months ago in Europe) Disc 1 starts off with 3 nice progressive tracks, before getting into some female vocal tracks with tracks 4 & 5. Track 5 is an incredible Chab remix of the new Rokysopp tune, Only This Moment. I love this track, which is actually features male and female vocals. I haven't heard the original version, which is on Rokysopp's new album, but this dark progressive remix is stunning.The entire disc is very strong, with some killer, and I mean KILLER tracks here, including Extraweit's stunning, dark instrumental Soopertrack, Max Graham's melodic Does She Know Yet, the hot vocal track I'll Kill You by Terry Grant, and the heavy percussion track This World by Slam featuring Tyrone Power. The only 2 tracks I don't like on this disc are the 2 by Chab! Funny, because one of the best on this disc is his Rokysopp remix!Disc 2 starts off on your typical trance journey, with an incredible new track by Re:Locate. I don't think they have ever had a bad track yet. A solid blend of trance continues, and we hit a very popular track at nuimber 3, Piiska by AR52, it's a haunting new sound that's been getting tons of spins by DJ's lately. Orana Project's Blue Storm and F Concept's Open Your Mind are the standouts, with the latter being a storming vocal trancer with none other than Tiff Lacey on the mic. She has been a very busy girl lately, with new tracks for ATB and Lost Witness.Things go techno at the end of disc 2, with the last 3 tracks, and the one I really don't like is Left Right Switch, which doesn't fit the theme of this CD mix at all, even though the last two tracks are very electro sounding (but good).Overall, an excellent progressive blend with only 2 or 3 bad tracks throughout the 26 featured here. A very sound investment for trance and progressive house lovers, especially if you enjoy both.

This film is long, poignant, interesting, haunting, dazzling to the eye, and actually quite scary. While watching it late one night, I found myself alone on the first floor of my house, and I must admit, I kept searching the room in fright after every little noise I heard. It's not a horror movie, but it rolls along at a slow, atmospheric, creepy-crawly pace.One bonus of the film being so long with big spaces between dialogue, it gives you the opportunity to switch to the informative commentary track, to hear some interesting insight into the film. While most other movies you MUST watch it with the commentary off to be able to take it all in correctly, you can actually get away with switching back and forth without missing too much of the actual film. One part of the commentary I disagreed with was when the male narrator noted that in the scene where Satorius takes the gauze off Hari's finger and tosses it, that he is doing this because of contamination. One can clearly see by his expression and manner in doing this, that he is being sarcastic as he knows that Hari does not need a bandage, because the wound will simply regenerate and heal in a matter of minutes. There is also a sense of his envy toward her because Kelvin gets to have a doppleganger of his wife to somewhat enjoy, while Satorius only has dwarfs to deal with.I think the scenes on Earth are gorgeous and completely necessary. Hoever, had they not been there like in the book, the movie would have been 2 hours instead of 2 hours and 40 minutes (a much easier time for mainstream audiences to grasp). I wouldn't trade it for a shorter run time at all. Tarkovsky is not a mainstream movie maker and thus the reason for him having these extra scenes on Earth, and he is still able to make a two hour film version of the book after that.With the exception of Star Wars, many sci-fi films of the 60's and 70's (including Kubrick's 2001) went all out with Sci-Fi special effects, but then seeing them today, they still seem very outdated. Where this film had no special effects budget and minimal sets, I think it still holds up today without looking dated. The scenes on Earth could have all taken place right now, or 30 years from now without anyone doubting it. And the look of the space station's interior, albeit vague and minimal, still looks fresh and definitely wouldn't appear out of place in any current sci fi setting.The only annoyance to me in the film was the switching between black and white and color. While a few scenes called for it due to a switch in tonality, or time within the film, there were other places where it made no logical sense to do so. Some say it was the lack of a budget that did not offer Tarkovsky a vast stash of color film, so he tried to artistically spare it. It's a shame if that's the case, because there are a few scenes in black and white, which would have worked much better in color.Overall, a masterpiece of a film that is certainly not for everyone. The majority of blockbuster oriented moviegoers will hate this film, but true film lovers should treasure it. Stunning visuals, superb acting, and a one of a kind director.

It's also the best 2 disc trance mix ever released! I kid you not! Purchase this cd and don't even think twice, as I guarantee if you love your trance loud, fast, with incredible melodies, and a sprinkle of some superb vocal trance, there isn't one aspect of this 2 disc set that you won't like. I haven't really been a Cosmic Gate fan before this (so my review is totally unibiased), but I must admit, after this, it instantly propells them onto my top 5 DJ list. They were primarily hard trance and techno DJ's who came out with quirky releases in the past, but have now firmly planted themselves into the upper echelon of trance DJ's.I've had this CD since late July, and since then you will find either disc 1 or 2 in my car, home player, or computer. I also have owned just about every other trance release this year, and it blows them all away, with the exception of TechnoClub Next2, which was my number one mix of the year until this was released. That CD is a masterpiece 2 disc set with 1 being mixed by Talla 2XLC and Kyau vs. Albert mixing disc 2, but it's one-upped by Cosmic Gate.The tracks are one non-stop, slammin', high energy tune after another. They start out disc 1 with their superb vocal track featuring Jan Johnston, I Feel Wonderful. The rest of the disc is filled mostly with top-notch instrumentals, but there are two other vocal tracks on here: the incredible new Lost Witness vocal track featuring Tiff Lacey, Home, and Cosmic Gate's own male vocal track Race Car Driver (which is another quirky effort with strange lyrics and theme, but it works well). These instrumentals on Disc 1 are the best of the best trance out there now, and many of these tracks have since appeared on other big name DJ mixes, mostly all after this release (keep in mind this came out 3 months ago in Germany).T4L's Perfect Blend is a perfect track, and along with Nic Chagall (one half of Cosmic Gate) featuring Sansibar's track Encee, make Disc 1 an incredible mix from top to bottom. And it doesn't stop ...Disc 2 starts off with a bang, with E-Craig's Call it Day, my pick for the hottest high energy trance hit of the year. Through these first 5 tracks, the BPM's are way, way up through an incredible line-up of the hardest trance you have ever heard assembled together, including Mark Norman's T-34 and Cor Fijneman's Banger, and also moving into one of the best male vocal tracks this summer, Marco V's More than A Life Away. Cosmic Gate checks in again near the end of this disc, with an updated mix of their techno classic The Drums.The beats just never stop, and the adrenaline level is higher throughout both discs than any CD set you own! There hasn't been anything like it ever released, even as far back as that late 90's trance explosion. It is simply the best high energy compilation of tracks ever mixed. DO NOT miss picking this up!

This is a very fun French film, not to be taken too seriously, as evidenced by the slick editing and pacing of the film. It's very funny in certain scenes, and what clinched it for me was the performance of Eduardo Noriega as the likable Graham/Pablo, who can't seem to remember what happened 15 minutes prior, let alone the previous night's encounter. We don't learn why he has this condition until much later in the film.His love interest in the film is the delightful Anna Mouglalis, who really clicks with Noriega's character. I last saw her in Claude Chabrol's Nightcap (Merci Le Pour Chocolat) and loved her in that film. The two bring great chemistry to the screen, despite Graham's lack of remembering their last liaison. She helps him try to overcome his forgetfulness in a number of different ways, including writing things on his body, and buying a two-way global tracking system, so they always know how to find each other.There are some very odd aspects to the film, including a some weird events that take place with the female boss at his office, and his supposedly best friend, Fred. As the other reviewer stated, these scenes lend some confusion, to an already choppy pace of the film. The film's other drawback is the somewhat weak ending. While very pleased with the ultimate conclusion, I thought the scenes leading up to the end, where he finds a tooth, and what he does with that tooth when he meets a car full of drifters (two women and one man), was rather contrived.An enjoyable comedy made memorable by the comedic proportions shaped by one's memory loss, and the sparkling chemistry between two people trying to overcome it.

There are 12 tracks (13 if you count a reprise of track 4), and only 4 are instrumentals. Clear Blue, which we have all heard a while back is a great track, and it opens the CD in a very shortened version. The next track is a rather slow, uneventful instrumental track. We get into Markus's splendid vocal track of this year, First Time, and it's an album edit, about 2 minutes shorter than the original version. The original gets into the vocals almost immediately, with a lot of vocal-less music in the end, while this album edit starts the vocals about 45 seconds in.Right now, there seems to be a ton of great male vocal tracks in both trance and progressive house. Sadly, Markus's collaboration with Gabriel and Dresden and Departure isn't one of them. The Coldharbour sound is nice, but the vocals spoil it. Next, we get two Carrie Skipper tracks and Markus update of You Won't See Me Cry. I have always liked You Won't See Me Cry, and this update is refreshing. Out of the two Carrie Skipper tracks, the 2nd one is a stunning ambient/chill track, but the 1st one, Once Again, falls short on the lyrics and vocals. The background music is sweet, but the vocals really distract and don't take the song anywhere special.Tracks 8 & 9 are instrumentals, one by Markus and Ballymena with Airwave. Neither are anything better than average, with the Airwave collaboration being a little more exciting. Track 10, another male vocal track, really isn't even mediocre. Travelling Light starts off like it's going to be one of the hottest trance tracks of the year, however that is just the music. When the vocals kick in, sadly, the track settles back down to mediocrity. Anita Kelsey, from First Time, sings on Sorrow Has No Home, but it can no way capture anything close to what was special about First Time.The main theme here is that the vocals really come up short in all tracks except First Time, You Won't See Me Cry, and the excellent ambient track, Never Be the Same. Actually, all the vocal tracks that didn't work, would have worked much better as instrumentals, especially Without You Near and Travelling Light. There music is better than the 3 true instrumentals on here.I really love ya Markus, and I really wanted this to be something good, but please come out with Miami '06 as soon as we pass the new year!!!! Overall, I can't recommend this, as Clear Blue and First Time, we've all heard and probably have already, and the ambient track and update of You Won't See Me Cry are just not enough to pull anyone in. The instrumentals could have been better and the vocals should have been instrumentals. There really isn't an ounce of the energy here that was so prevalent in Miami '05.

When this was being released, I saw the tracklisting and was hesitant to buy it, because nothing really stood out to me. I should have went with my first instinct because I went and bought it, and was quite disappointed.18 tracks on here, but it's 2 discs. That's only 3 more than a 15 track one disc mix. The problem here is, only about 8 or 9 tracks out of the 18 are average to above average trance. If Ferry would have just started with tracks 1,2,4, & 8 on each disc (weird how those are the best tracks on both discs), he would have had 8 great tracks to start with, than add a few more and you are off to a one disc trance heaven.Oakie (Creamfield's), Armin (State of Trance 2005), and Tiesto (ISOS4) all came out with subpar two disc mixes and should have stuck to 1. I can't stand playing a disc and having to skip half of the tracks, especially when you want to keep the flow going of a DJ mix.Most of the instrumental trance Ferry plays here is decent, but not great. It's too slow and never builds energy or a flow long enough to keep your interest, especially when EVERY track runs 6-9 minutes. It's like he just let each track play from start to finish and simply spliced the next one together at the end. If he is going to go that far, I'd rather have all unmixed tracks (like Germany's excellent Trancemaster series).After hearing incredible 2 disc trance mixes this year such as Cosmic Gate's Back to Back Vol. 2 (hands down the best trance mix of the year), Markus Schulz's excellent Miami '05, and Techoclub Next2 (disc 1 mixed by Talla 2XLC & disc 2 by Kyau vs. Albert) this set pales in comparison. With the exception of the Purple Haze track, and the awesome Blue Monkey by Misja Helsloot, there aren't any other superb, WOW tracks on here to blow your socks off. So even with my advice of trimming this to 1 disc, he would still have a mix far below some other superb 1 disc trance mixes of recent: George Acosta's Lost World, Johan Gielen's For You, and Kyau vs. Albert's Positive Ways 4.There are a few bombs on here too, like the horrible Who's Knockin on CD2 ... oh, my where did he find this stinker. The Dogzilla track is bad too. They made a bangin' remix of Ernesto & Bastian's Dark Side of the Moon, but there own release is a let down. And what is going on with the 1 hour time on each CD?? He could have easily fit 2 to 3 more tracks, even at their full length, onto each CD, which could have perked this whole thing up a bit.Simply put, there are much better 1 and 2 disc trance mixes out there this year, so throw your money in their direction rather than here.

I have had just about every Tiesto CD at one time or another, and while I like his stuff a lot, I like to keep my CD collection from getting out of control, therefore ISOS3 is the only one of his I keep and will not part with.You will be hard pressed to find any trance mixed CD that is as moving, smooth, and driven as this one. An awesome selection of tracks and a CD that you just want to hear from start to finish, over and over again. One could never grow tired of this mix. My only minor complaint is, the start of tracks are way off from where Tiesto begins to chage selections in the mix. It is very annoying if you love to upload ceratain songs to your ipod. I think all DJ mixed CD's should be more accurate in their track starts/stops. Maybe they do it purposely to stop copying?Anyway, the only other DJ trance mixed album that is coming close to this one for me is Ronski Speed's Positive Ways 3, released may of '04 by Euphonic (Germany). Every time I hear that one, it's slowly creeping up on ISOS3, in fact, it may even surpass it for me. It's another that is so sweet from start to finish. Go look for Positive Ways 3, you won't be disappointed!!

That quote was Arthur Daley reassuring Terry McCann that the minding business is still for him. Minder, one of the best British shows in their tv history, finally gets a region 1, USA release. Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, and George Cole as Arthur Daley were teamed up for 7 seasons from 1979-1987. It ran from 1979-1985 for series 1-6, and then had 3 years off before resuming one final year with McCann, on season 7. Seasons 8-10 resumed with Arthur's nephew, played by Gary Webster, taking over for Terry McCann, but the chemistry of Waterman and Cole were what made this show such a phenomenon.Seasons 1 & 2 didn't receive high ratings on TV, and it wasn't until series 3 that the show finally became a hit. They even went back and replayed seasons 1 & 2 after series 3 went over so well. Aside from a few dull early episodes in Season 1, the rest of the episodes through season 6 were solid entertainment. Most episodes revolved around Arthur finding some nearly crooked job for him and Terry to make a nice little earner, only for him to take most of the prize money in the end, citing expenses, overhead, and other preposterous reasons to con Terry out of his share. Terry did get back at Arthur in several episodes, and more than once our lovable rogue con man ended up on the losing side of a profit.Terry McCann was an ex-boxer and ex-con, two reasons to make him the best minder, or bodyguard, in London. He often squared off against the right hand men and much-bigger-than-he hired hands of London underworld's most crooked citizens. Of course, he would always find the time to romance the leading ladies who were tied up in his latest job. Arthur's earners had Terry doing everything from minding Arab millionares to minding women's dresses.The comedic antics of George Cole really made him a legend of British TV. Everyone during those years, and even now, knows who Arthur Daley is. Arthur and Terry usually hung out at the Winchester Club, run by Arthur's old mate, Dave. He hated it when Arthur would bring his business inside and rough up his club. Dave was the only other regular character in Minder, besides Terry and Arthur. There were also the minor characters of Des, Terry's car thief friend, the on-the-take Inspector Rycott, and the righteous Inspector Chisolm, who all made numerous appearances in the show.If you haven't already gotten a hold of region 2 or 4 releases of this show, now is your chance to see some of the best and most unique television you'll ever see.

One of the worst movies I can ever recall watching. Choppy editing; long, drawn out scenes that lead nowhere; poorly written characters and dialogue; ugly cinematography. Combine that with an awkward looking DVD cover; poor audio quality on the DVD (you have to turn the TV volume way up, only to have the next thing you put on blow your speakers off the TV); and no choice of English subtitles; and content and presentation wise, this one is truly at the bottom of the barrel.

If you love 'The Sweeney' British TV show, then you won't be disappointed with these two movies. They play as elongated television episodes with a bit more violence and bad language thrown in, no doubt catering to the big screen crowd.If you have never seen the TV show, I suggest you do not start here, as it's like jumping into any TV show in the middle of it's run without ever seeing it before. You may find it odd, but on the other hand, it may be 'your bag'. I am surprised that this was released for the USA market as I don't believe any tv episodes were ever shown here, or available on video or dvd.The cockney slang that was used quite frequently in the tv series is somewhat missing here, probably because the producers were planning on the movies being distributed in other countries. In that respect, it's a little more easier to follow for the average US citizen than the tv shows.John Thaw as Regan is gritty as ever, and I like him much better in this series than as Inspector Morse. Dennis Waterman and the usual Flying Squad team are all here too. While Waterman does an excellent job as Carter, his best TV was yet to come, as the now legendary Terry Mcann in the long running British series Minder.

Andain's smash hit Beautiful Things has firmly established itself as one of THE trance anthems of the past 6 years. Tiesto and many other DJ's picked this track up very quickly, especially after her previous song, Summer Calling, was so good. There was a recent new track on Gabriel & Dresden's Bloom CD called Here is the House, but it couldn't possibly come close to this one. Her only other track I know of is the pop/chill tune called You Once Told Me, found on Chillout '05, which is actually very good as well. Aside from her awful lip-syncing performance on Tiesto's In Concert DVD, Andain's voice has been perfect for trance.Unfortunately, one of the best versions of this song is not on here: Markus Schulz's Shadows of Coldharbour remix. It's on his Coldharbour Sessions CD. On this CD single, the best version is clearly the Photon Project Remix, with it's long, driving, and ever changing pace and beats. The 1st track, radio edit, is the slower, original version of the song, which is divine in it's own right. Some of the other remixes on here are not up to snuff, but with the normal version, and the Photon Project Remix, you can't ever go wrong.

If you don't know your Mockney slang (Cockney rhyming slang), you might have some difficulty following one of the grittiest cop shows on either side of the Atlantic. Long before NYPD Blue was catching the attention of our FCC censors, The Sweeney (Scotland Yard's Flying Squad of plain clothes detectives) was thrust upon UK viewers in the mid 70's, with some harsh language, occasional topless girls, and the over the top, violent antics of the fiercest cops in England.John Thaw, as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, perfectly fills what is possibly his best known role, apart from Inspector Morse. Dennis Waterman, as Regan's partner, Sergeant George Carter, is equally talented in fisticuffs, which would come in handy in Waterman's next series, Minder, where he played bodyguard for hire, Terry McCann.Regan often twisted the rules of the law to apprehend his criminals, usually convincing the apprehensive Carter to help. Regan was often in trouble with his superiors, and was under constant scrutiny from internal affairs. The show lasted 4 seasons, and ended with Regan actually getting ... well, I won't give it away!Apart from the double disc set of the 2 late 70's Sweeney big screen films, which has been available on Amazon for years now, the 4 seasons of this hugely popular British show have not been available in the US until now! It's about time!

If you don't know your Mockney slang (Cockney rhyming slang), you might have some difficulty following one of the grittiest cop shows on either side of the Atlantic. Long before NYPD Blue was catching the attention of the FCC censors, the Sweeney (Scotland Yard's Flying Squad of plain clothes detectives) was thrust upon UK viewers in the early to mid 70's, with some harsh language, occasional topless girls, and the over the top violent antics of the fiercest cops in England.John Thaw, as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, perfectly fills what is possibly his best known role, apart from Inspector Morse. He's nothing like that character, in fact, you'd be in for a shock if you haven't seen him in action in the Sweeney before. Dennis Waterman, as Regan's partner, Sergeant George Carter, is equally talented in fisticuffs, which would come in handy in Waterman's next series Minder, playing bodyguard for hire Terry McCann, which would be his best known role.Regan often twisted the rules of the law to apprehend his criminals, usually convincing the apprehensive Carter to help. Regan was often in trouble with his superiors, and was constantly under scrutiny from internal affairs. The show lasted 4 seasons, and ended with Regan actually getting ... well, I won't give it away!Apart from the double disc set of the 2 late 70's Sweeney big screen films, which is avaiable on Amazon, the 4 seasons of the show have not been available in the US. All 4 sets are available in the UK, with some great extras. If you have the capability to play region 2 PAL discs, don't hesitate to pick up a season of one of the best cop shows in TV history (any country).

Let's start with the original album disc. It has an incredible mix of soothing house vocals (the new super hit Anything But You and Melt) and flaring instrumentals (Apollo and the even better Killa). The disc is an even blend of both, with just the right dose of vocals at just the right times. Ulrich Schnauss collaborates on the quirky instrumental track Northern Lights, and gets his face on the cover for it! A sample of Tangerine Dream is even used on one track.Now I got my CD in Sept, from the UK, which puts the CD out on the Distinctive label, so I am not sure if the tracks are going to be different on the US release bonus mix CD or not. If they are the same, both Amazon UK and US got the tracks wrong, as my CD is much different from Amazon UK's tracklistings (which still differs from the US's). Anyway, this mix CD starts off with some melodic progressive house, until piledriving into some incredible dance floor stomping house tracks, like WOW's own Pulse of Life, which is awesome. Another standout is Carrier by David West, which drives the BPM's way up when you reach track 12. You also get Palava's Surrender, a nice male vocal dance floor track. Also, there are no tracks with expletives in the title, as Amazon US seems to list.Overall, you get two incredible CD's for the money, one sweet Prog. house mix, and one great new album.

I have to say, I am not the biggest Sasha fan, having only his Xpander EP in my collection. I've had his Ibiza, Airdrawndagger, and San Francisco CD's in the past, but decided not to keep them, because they just didn't motivate me.This one is a keeper and I love the track selection and flow of this CD. I also liked the limited's notes for each song, where Sasha tells you what he did with each track. It's a little annoying opening that plastic pillow case up every time you want to play this, so I actually pulled the CD out and put it into a blank CDR case for easy access (because Lord knows I am dropping this one in the player a ton).The remix of Watching Cars Go By by Felix Da Housecat is incredible. It essentially makes the CD and lifts it to an enormously groovy feel toward the end. It's so much better than the original version, and truly shows how Sasha's touch greatly enhances each and every track in this mix.This is one of the best and most innovative mixes of the decade, so go out and buy it!!

There is a warning sticker for explicit content, not language, as there is some nudity and steamy love scenes in the video. This is an excellent CD single for one of the best vocal trance tracks of late 2004/early 2005. All the remixes are good, but the mainstay is the blazing hot club mix, followed by the two Martin Roth remixes (he is a hot remixer lately). Two versions of this track you don't get are the excellent album version, found on Monument, and the E-Craig's 212 vocal mix, which came out in middle 2005, but in my opinion, is a weak remix. You need to have this track in some form or another, or you are missing out on one of the best vocal trancers of the past few years.

A few house tracks lead the way early on, and then it's mostly all minimal and tech house the rest of the way through. What Cassy has designed is the ultimate bar atmosphere, hence the aptly named title of her mix. It's like lounging in this Panorama Bar, and grooving along to superb mixing, and quality tech and minimal tracks. The tempo remains consistent throughout, and it never quite reaches a dance floor pace, but stays upbeat enough to keep your spirits high throughout this excellent mix. One of my favs this year, and perfect if your want to soothe yourself through downtempo, but straightforward tech.

Susan Surandon's cynical remark to Donald Sutherland, indicating that although he's lived all his life in South Africa, he was oblivoius to the brutality surrounding his normal family life. Schoolteacher Meneer Du Toit literally loses everything in his struggle to bring justice to those responsible for the deaths of his gardener and his gardener's son. Feeling guilty after taking his gardener's son's death a little too lightly, he is immediately swept up in the chaotic world of corruption and bloody cover-ups, after seeing the body of his badly beaten and tortured friend of 15 years.The movie is full of gripping scenes and holds nothing back, with brutal slayings of children, torture scenes, and a disturbing view into a hospital mortuary. The film is primarily rated R for these violent images.Marlon Brando, although appearing for maybe 15-20 minutes of the film, really takes over in his scenes, as slick barrister, Ian MacKenzie. Even though his courtroom battle is futile, he certainly gets in his licks. He played his character to a tee, and definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, despite the controversy that year, over his limited screen time.I was much younger when I first rented the film around 1990, and it hits me harder today than it did back then. It's a well acted film, and a powerful one, Donald Sutherland gives and incredible perfomance and a particularly moving scene in the film is when he is in tears on the phone, speaking to his daughter, after finally realizing she has betrayed him. Except for his son, most of his family, friends, and colleagues do not wish to associate with him after the path his as chosen in fighting a losing battle against corruption. A top notch film about a man willing to give up everything, in pursuit of truth and justice over the wrongful death of a friend. This should be on everyone's must see list of important 80's films.

This made for German television epic story of several people attempting to help their friends, families, and loved ones escape from East Berlin to free West Berlin. It is based on a true story, and in the DVD extras, you actually get to meet the real man responsible for the story in this film, whose name was slightly changed for the movie.Popular German actor Heino Ferch gives a superb performance as the leader of a group of tunnel diggers, determined to get their loved ones out of the Communist side of Berlin, just after the Berlin Wall was built. For Ferch's character, Harry, it's his beloved sister, for Harry's friend Matthis, it's his spouse, and for the young girl Fritzi, who the group are quite suspisious of, it's her fiance' who is currently building the wall, but desperately wants out. There are many others helping, who don't necessarily have loved ones to help escape, including the American, Vic, who despite his leg injury, is just as determined as the rest, and even takes some of the biggest risks in the film.The performances throughout the entire cast are top notch, and while there isn't a ton of action until the end, the tense atmosphere of the film really keeps you glued to the set. The emotions in the film are high, and the bonds between Harry and his sister, Lotte, and Matthis and his wife Carola, are so realistically portrayed, that it's easy to see why they are going through months and months of digging to get these people out.The 167 minutes seem like they flew on by, and I could have gone on watching more of these intriguing characters. It's better than any other spy or war thrillers released in any country over the last several years. Hard to believe it was made for German TV, as it blows away several big screen productions. The direction, cinematography, script, and choice of actors cannot be faulted, and the only fault would be if you miss this gripping film.

It's hard to warrant buying unmixed electronic comps these days, as you have to take into consideration the overall price of the CD, as opposed to how many good tracks are really on it, that you can simply download to cut costs and just get the prime cuts you want. This label sampler proves that having the entire CD is not only worth it, but an absolute must. Not only do you get a somewhat similar techno themed unit of tracks, but you get just about every hot techno artist in Europe, and it's mind blowing to realize they are all part of BPitch Control (with the exception of Jahcoozi and Fairmont). This truly spells what may be the best label for European techno at the moment.There isn't a dull track on here, from the exciting rap sounds in two grime tracks, to the quirky vocals in Tomas Andersson's Go To Disco, to the stunning final track by Fairmont. A nice variety of various forms of techno, and solid ones at that. We even get one new track by Ellen & Apparat, which sounds a lot like a track that would have fit nicely in with their Orchestra of Bubbles album, and really identifies their distinctive sounding collaboration.Don't even stop to sample a few of these, because you are bound to like them all. Just buy the entire thing! The best unmixed comp I have heard this year. My only complaint would be they didn't get to fit a Kiki or Smash TV track on here! Oh, well.

PLUSES: Tim Robbins throroughly deserved his Oscar as this was the best character and on screen performance of his career. The movie was 130 minutes and for 120 minutes it was riveting, emotional, AND had you on the edge of your seat. I was fully enthralled with all the characters and the plot development. All the performances were excellent (with the exception of Laura Linney -- see minuses) and it was a great cast. I liked Laurence Fishburne's portrayal, as he was the extreme opposite of Kevin Bacon, being the unbiased, hard nosed cop, while Bacon had emotional ties to the case and his old friends to deal with. Sean Penn was superb, but I'm not sure about him being Oscar worthy.MINUSES: Laura Linney's Boston accident was horrible!! Also, in my opinion, her character turned out to be the coldest of the entire movie. Her speech and scene with Penn at the end was utterly unwatchable, disgusting, and revolting! The 120 great minutes of this movie was rolling along and going to be in my top 50 movies of all time. Then I got to this scene and the movie went to not even making my top 500 list. This scene, her character, and her performance were all UTTERLY UNFATHOMABLE!!! Highly unbelievable and contrived! The rest of the movie kind of fell apart in a bad way after that scene, and never recovered. The amount of cold people and cover-ups (7 people involved??) that happened in the last few minutes was completely implausible.Boom, then it's over. Recommended, but not one to cherish, re-watch, or keep in your collection.

While this is definitely a decent dance CD, with plenty of pumping tracks straight through to keep a dance floor sweaty all night, there just aren't any standouts on here. There are no catchy anthems to really excite me. Most of the tracks are good, none are great. The other sad part is that 5 out of the 12 tracks are Sfaction remixes, which put that buzz into the track from the Benassi. Bros. original house anthem, Satisfaction. It uses the same buzzing melody, just in slightly different arragements, and it's beginning to get very monotonous. Darude began making all his Sandstorm remixes of everything to drive us nuts, and now the Benassi Bros. are playing out their Satisfaction sound. It needs to stop right now. They have had some great tracks in the past with the digital classic Satisfaction, and the Dhany voiced Hit My Heart of last year, and under the alias KMC, they had Dhany's spectacular track I Feel So Fine. Now they have delved into standard dance floor tracks, with no real identity, and have turned all their other tracks into the repititous sounding rework of their best known track.None of the vocals or lyrics ever rope you in, and while Sandy sounds better than she has on any other track, I still am not a fan. She sounds like she has marbles in her mouth at the start of the track Castaway. It's still a decent sounding track though, and it is probably the best on here along with Ride To Be My Girl, which ironically, is another digitally altered voiceover and makes for one of their best tracks again.After hearing this CD several times, there isn't any one particular track that really screams play me again and again. It's decent stuff, and certainly better than a lot of crap albums where barely 3 songs are good and the rest are horrible. There really aren't any awful tracks on here. If you just want to dance, but to nothing special, buy this. If you want more, trust me, there's lots more out there.The other thing is, there must be 3 versions of this CD, with the 3rd, normal version, not being offered on Amazon. My version was normally priced like most CD's, but does not have a video on it. The video enhanced version on Amazon is higher priced, and there is an even higher priced import listed. My version, and the standard one, does not seem to be for sale here???

Unlike some past years NBA champion team sets, this one is pretty bare bones, but the price is reflective of this. Instead of paying seventy to eighty bucks and getting every single game, highlight, interview, and behind the scenes features, you're getting the new, possibly catered to the bad economy, stripped down edition. That's not a bad thing, as it keeps the price low for fans just wanting to revisit all their wins. That's all this set is, 5 games: their 4 wins in the NBA finals, and the entire Game 7 of the Cavs series. No special features of any kind, like incorrectly noted in the description, so beware of that.We already got the final quarters or that Cavs game, and the final quarter of the Pistons series last game in2007-2008 NBA Champions - Boston Celtics. You also got a recap of the season and a story about their championship run, so you have to get that one if you're looking for bonus features.For the more diehard fans, there's also the documentaryReturn to the Rafters, and a DVD all about KGNBA: Kevin Garnett - KGto check out.

In my opinion, the original track is just barely above average, as it's a little too slow, fluffy, and cheesy for my dance liking. However, add Victor Calderone's tribal funk energy collaboration with Suryanto and this becomes one of the best dance tracks of '04. You must get this single, as I believe the imports might not have the Calderone version, and this is the one to have.

Even the annoying live crowd, which I've said time and time again should never be included in DJ mix CD's, does not take away from the fact that this is one of the most dynamic mixes of the year, with high adrenalin electro and tech vibes throughout. The mix takes one small lull in the middle, just to let you recover a bit, then continues on it's zippy pace, right up to the last track. A few times early on, the crowd noise actually did add a nice effect, but quickly got tiresome after several oohs and whoas. You can hear their excitement when Oliver drops the first track, which is an incredible remix by Extrawelt, one of the hottest electro artists right now. A great pick to start off the mix, as he goes straight for the jugular, without wasting time for any warm up or downtempo tracks to start things off.You can't pass this one up if you are into electro and tech house. It hits an extremely high energy level, and you don't have to take it from me, just listen in with one very enthusiastic Brazilian crowd that night.

A new, but sort of retro looking yellow Jack Hammer is released in the Tool Tech line. After Lava Jack Hammer, Robotz Jack Hammer, and Powermax Jack Hammer (which all used the same molded Jack) and now they've gone back to making him look like the classic Jack Hammer figures of old. He comes with a sturdy looking, pull string operated drill, which is lots of fun for little ones. Out of the 3 new pull string tool tech figures (Billy Blazes, this one, and Jake Justice), this one looks the most durable.

This new Jake Justice actually looks like a repaint of an older Jake Justice. No new sculpt, I guess to cut costs, and they've also taken away the battery operated PowerMax tools and made some cool new pull string action tools. This one features a battering ram, similar to Jake's PowerMax figure, but it's much lighter and uses much thinner plastic (which puts long term durability in question). The figure we got also has a very loose waist, so just moving the figure about spins his body around without you wanting it to. I wonder if the end of the prolific Rescue Heroes toy line is near, as they are just using old molds, cheaper tools and packaging, with no new added characters.

There are 3 new tool tech figures that have pull string motorized action: Billly, Jake Justice, and Jack Hammer. These new tools have replaced the heavy, chunky, battery operated PowerMax tools, but perform the same actions, and have cut down a few dollars on cost. The only downside is that the plastic on the axe chopping tool is very thin, and durability becomes a question. However, we've had it for a while and it keeps on working and hasn't broke yet. I just don't think it can hold up to as much abuse as the old PowerMax tools.

How many times can they release Buster the crime fighting, missile launching dog in the Rescue Heroes line??? They just had him come with Bill Barker in the Police Patrol line, with a slightly different color scheme, and he's been released several times before that. If you are new to the line, than the police officer Captain Cuffs and his dog isn't a bad option, but if you have Buster already, you are better off going for Captain Cuffs deluxe figure which comes with a black painted uniform (this figure is in the grey uniform) and a police motorcycle. For a few bucks more, I think the police bike would be more fun than Buster.

Virtually the same as the Force of Nature Billy and Smokey and someone correct me if I'm wrong because I haven't actually purchased this one, but the axe that comes with the Force of Nature set, that attaches to the side of Smokey, is absent from the Nature Crew version. Unless it's taped to the bottom inside of the cardboard packaging, it seems like they left it out.You still get a newer face sculpt of Billy (there have been so many in this toy line) and Smokey the cool fire fighting dog with the massive water shooting gun on his back.

The outdoor Hero Dewey C.M. is a popular character in the Heroes line (one of my son's favorites), even though he's really not featured in any of the animated shows that I have seen. He may have been created just for the toy line. He is the same molded figure as Marshall Artz/Law, and this Nature Crew version in the open packaging is the 3rd one. It features a lighter green camo scheme than the last two releases, and Glades, the Alligator is a very light green. Dewey also comes with a backpack that has a non-functioning claw attached.The first Dewey was part of the Force of Nature series (enclosed packaging), has light brown hair like this one, and is a slightly darker green camo color, and his chest is metallic green. The 2nd Dewey was in the plastic limited edition case, had no alligator but came with a large functioning claw, and he had a dark green camo scheme, camouflage face paint, and black hair (making him look more like Marshall Law).You can't go wrong with this figure for any Rescue Heroes fan.

These guys are two of the hardest working producers in the DJ biz and with some sort of help from Kristy Gabriel (I'm assuming this is Josh's wife) and Pete Tong (as the liner notes suggest), they have finally come out with an awesome 2 DISC trance mix. The duo behind Motorcycle and Andain have released their first album, which is a thrilling continuous mix, combining their own progressive style tracks and projects with current trance music. While 2 of the biggest trance anthems in years, Beautiful Things and As The Rush Comes, are technically not on the tracklistings, they do make an appearance (read on)!The reviewer from Australia who gives no write up about the actual musical content, obviously does not even have this CD, because if he did, he would realize it is a 2 disc set, and certainly not 1 as he so incorrectly complained about. This is a 2 disc set with 22 tracks, 11 on each disc.Disc 1 starts off with 3 new G&D; tracks, which are all a very fresh and new sounding trance style, which G&D; and their close sounding progressive trance remix/producer cousins Above & Beyond seem to be thrusting the trance world into. I guess I would describe it as futuristic, funky, and a few BPM's above chill. Track 2, Serendipity, starts off with beats sounding similar to their remix of No One On Earth. Track 4 is a new one from Andain, Here is the House, which starts off with a sort of dark, driving intro, reminding me of As the Rush Comes, and quickly gets into Andain's silky smooth vocals, which start off light, then pick up with the track. Make no mistake about it, this track will be exploding in late 2004! The lyrics are only so-so and border on cheese, but the beat is incredible. A new dancefloor anthem for sure. This track blends well into Michael Burns' dance floor shaking track, Forwards, and then it's on to the excellent new Sarah McLachlan song World On Fire, which I first heard in Above and Beyond's Essential Mix back in June. Aside from the 12" vinyl release, this is currently not available on CD anywhere but here.Next is the Audioholics' External Key, a very slick, upbeat track, which slows down beautifully for some acapella of Beautiful Things to be snuck in, then picks right back up again. Then comes Voyager's Someone Else, which sort of pulsates to a different (but oh so familiar beat early on), before gliding into it's own, but not finishing until we faintly hear the sounds of an angelic sounding JES (As the Rush Comes) materializing in the background. A thumping and 4th original G&D; track, Dub Horizon, is up next, and the CD finishes off with 2 more bouncy, progressive dance floor rhythms.We slip into a few ambient tracks to set the stage for CD 2, then things really get pumped up with track 3: Lili Haydn's Anything (Gabriel and Dresden Code 313 Dub) which is an incredible trance instrumental that touches on all sorts of current trance vibes, and just when you thought you've heard all the melody levels in this track, it seems to unfold again. I haven't heard the original of this track, but I am assuming G&D; played a big role in putting the "rush" into this one. I actually had to replay this track 3 times in a row before continuing with the rest of the disc, as it's simply amazing.Dido's Don't Leave Home gets a 10 minute Gabriel and Dresden overhaul on disc 2 and it sounds great. Her vocals flow well with the trance melodies. An interesting funky track called Sub by Bigtop takes us into one of the best Trance tracks of '04, No One On Earth. This is the G&D; mix, and the track sounds so great with their spin on it, I can't choose between this or the just as superb original Above & Beyond mix. The vocals are so great, both tracks take on their own vibe and no one on earth should be without either of them!We also get two new tracks by Josh Gabriel solo, with the first, Alive, offering some creative sounding, electronically enhanced male vocals. Good male vocals are extremely rare in trance, and this track combined with some heavy progressive trance, works well. His other track Switch has a pulsating, funky sound, and you could almost call this track Alive too, as it's so flavorful and pumping.The CD ends off with Imagination, the hugely anticipated Mototcyle follow-up to As the Rush Comes, which is an acoustic version with just JES and a guitar. Her voice is sweet and it's very slow but moving. It will be interesting to hear an original version with what background sounds they decide to couple with her lyrics. It would be extremely difficult to come back with a 2nd slammin track after As the Rush Comes, but I don't think it's trying to follow the same path. It's well worth a listen.Overall, this futuristic, funky, progressive style trance from G&D; is here to stay, and reflects all the right paths that trance should be taking right now. Oakenfold and Armin should take some notes, as this easily surpasses their two trance 2 disc sets released this year. This is in my top 3 trance mix CD's of '04, with ATB's DJ in the Mix (oh BTW vol.2 is due out by the end of '04), and Ronski Speed's Positive Ways 3. Now all we need is an Above & Beyond 2 disc set or at least an Oceanlab album!!!

The first Minimize to Maximize started it off with an unmixed collection of techno and minimal from Richie Hawtin's label M_nus or Minus. Number 2 continues with another great lineup of quality tech artists. This time there's no track by Richie himself, but it's no bother as the likes of Magda, Troy Pierce, Wink, and Marc Houle, are star power enough to hold one's interest in this compilation. Standouts include the opening track by Heartthrob, which also opens Sven Vath's new mix cd Sound of the Seventh Season, the bubbly, water like sounds of Tractile's Unquenchable, and the melodic closing track by king of German minimal, Loco Dice.Like the first, it's another great set of tracks and you can't do wrong as there are really no uniteresting ones or duds to be found.

What makes this film truly a gem, is the fact that there isn't a single film in movie history that you can compare it to. Probably the closest would be his last appearance as Monsieur Hulot, in Traffic. In Playtime, Hulot's 3rd appearance, it's just Tati wandering around a mechanized Paris, running into hinderances along the way. This a a charming comedy, and not a laugh out loud one. It does have it's funny moments, and you really need a second or even third viewing to appreciate all that is appearing on screen. I love just popping this one in, and letting it play while I am doing things around the house. With it not having a plot, you can jump in at any time, and catch glimpses of it here and there without missing much. It's probably the only movie of it's kind you can do that with.This film literally emptied Tati's pocket's getting it made with the costly sets and hundreds of extras. However, he pressed on and got it completed, much to the film going world's benefit. It's a pleasant trip down a the lane of a film maker's mind we will probably never come close to gazing into again. There just aren't any films around like this anymore, as the days of sight gags, and silent comedians are long over. Hopefully it will get re-issued soon, either by Criterion or another company. It deserves to be in print, and the UK apparently doesn't have any licensing issues, as it's in current release over there.As far as the debate over the aspect ratio is concerned, I do know this: I had a Toshiba DVD player at one time, which had a unique feature of zooming out, as well as zooming in. When I zoomed out, it made the film look even wider screen, but the important factor was, that it showed me a few millimeters more on either side, which I couldn't see on my other TV and DVD player. In a film like this, which is full of long shots, and lots of people and things happening in every corner, it was a benefit to have that feature. That was of course, until that DVD player of mine broke. So there is actually more on the transfer, it's just that with every TV and DVD player cutting off a tiny bit on the sides, you lose a little something. I wanted to see this film when it ran on the big screen for a limited time about 2 years ago, but it only hit select cities and didn't come near me. Seeing it in the theater must be a huge treat!One tip if you are searching out the Criterion out of print version is to make sure you ask who you are buying it from, whether it says first printing or second printing in small print on the lower back of the case. You want the second printing. The DVD is rare to find either way, but the second printing is much, much rarer, as you either had to trade your first printing into Criterion to get the corrected version, or find it in the stores, if they even stocked the second one prior to it going out of print. The difference is the first version had an incorrect aspect ration on the Terry Gilliam interview and the Tati short film. They both appeared squished into widescreen format, when they should have been full screen.

Adventurers, Explorers, Kung-Fu fighters, Super Heroes, these are what little boys dream of being from ages 6 to 12. Star Wars, 1977, a mystique was born, that after a brief resurrection, has now died. The Star Wars magic is no more. It was a unique magic, a Force to be reckoned with, that seemed to somehow surpass all others. Every boy could withouth hesitation, dream of being Luke Sykwalker, or Han Solo, fighting evil across the galaxy, and winning a heroes welcome.Whiffle ball bats became light sabers in our friend's backyards. "I want to be Luke", "no I do". Not many of us wanted to be Darth Vader though, or the dark side, or evil. We all saw the good in Luke, in Star Wars, and just who wouldn't want to win out in the end, or be the good guy who squashes all the baddies.Star Wars was fun, it was about good triumphing over evil, and an adventurous drive that never burned out. In all 3 of the original films, with the exception of Obi Wan (whose death was by no means brutal and it turned out to be a blessing to the force) no hero dies, no fun is killed off, no losers in the end. We all have fun watching the heros have fun; we are all entertained; we are all swept away in this galaxy, which for most of us, could never be that far away.We learned from the original trilogy how Luke's father became a Dark Lord with the help of the Emperor, and many other things about in the SW timeline before the 1st movie. Most of these things were bad: the Jedi dying out, Luke and Leia's mother not surviving, Anakin turning evil. All bad things. Well, who wants to see bad things? Wouldn't we have rather seen 3 films in the "further Adventures of Luke, Han, Chewie, and Leia fighting evil in the galaxy and being heroes" saga than a prequel that we all know is about evil winning? ABSOLUTELY!Instead, Lucas attempts to go back to the dark times, and create some sort of good out of it, some sort of entertaining movies that he thinks the majority of the SW viewing public would rather see. I believe he made a grave error. Now, I loved Phantom Menace, as that Star Wars magical adventure seemed to set sail again. A thilling, FUN ride through the universe with the majority of the heros winning out, aside from that one exception almost paralleling Obi Wan in the 1st film (Qui Gon). The magic had again arrived.On to Attack of the Clones, which straight from the opening get-go, was flat out un-Star Wars like, and very unspectacular. I mean, how can you compare Amidala's decoy getting blown up to all the other 3 film openings (a massive space battle and the arrival of Vader on Leia's ship; the battle on Hoth; the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba; and most recently, two jedi walking into a spacebound trap, only to muscle their way out with the help of their illustrious light sabers... sabers we had not seen for 16 long years). ATOC just didn't hold up, and there was no winning in it, it only seemed to leave our heros lingering and meddling through a dreadful script. It also introduced the worst actor in the SW universe, Hayden Christensen.Christensen is one reason which pulls Revenge of the Sith back into mediocricy, back from it's otherwise glorious display of action and light saber duels. With the way too sudden and very unbelievable transformation Anakin takes to transform to the Dark Side, it would have been extremely difficult for any actor to pull it off, let alone a horrible one such as Christensen. One second there still seems to be some good, and some conflict in Anakin's thinking, and literally within moments, he is bowing and on one knee, calling Palpatine his Master. Very, very contrived and hard to swallow.While the light saber duels were spectacular enough to keep your mind off the drenload of CGI going on behind everyone, there was still not enough of the magical SW locations to drool over: Hoth, Tatooine, the palaces of Naboo, were all long forgotten and replaced with studios and green screens.Every good that is good in SW (with ironically, one of the few exceptions being Obi Wan) get killed off. All the heros are gone. No one to root for, no magical carpet ride to keep us flying into the sunset. Even poor Yoda and Obi Wan are forced to hang their heads in exile. For Obi Wan, the exile on Tatooine didn't do him very good justice, as he leaves ROTS looking about 35, and in 20 years time to A New Hope, he seems to be 65 years old. Very strange. Anakin also appears to have aged 30+ years in the time it took Luke to grow up to be a 19 year old boy (judging by his holo image in ROTJ).Who wants to read a comic book, have a spectacular dream, or fantasize about heros dying, villains prevailing, and all that is good in life being demolished. Not very many of us. Let's ask ourselves why any of these prequels needed to be shown. Hadn't the horror stories told to us by the original trilogy characters been enough? Plenty, to me.All in all, taken on it's own, out of the Star Wars universe, it is an action packed movie that any kick-butt action flick afficianado can love. However, for those who still have that little boy inside, who is still yearning to go back to a long time ago, and fight, save, and be the hero of a galaxy far, far away, our time in the Star Wars universe has past, and it's a time we may never see again.

Big electronic music festivals are unfortunately nonexistent here in the US, but quite strong in places like Europe and Australia. This 2 disc mix set was produced to capture the sounds of this Australian dance music festival, and put out by none other than Australia's hottest electronic label, EQ Recordings. They are also quickly becoming one of the hottest worldwide electronic labels, with stellar CD mix series' like Balance and Electric.This time, it's Chris Lake and Derek K sharing the dj duties and both deliver great track selections and smooth mixing. It's really a true 5 star 2 disc mix, as both would rate 5 stars on their own. I slightly prefer Lake's as he uses more tech house. Disc 1 by Lake, starts off with a bang and the high bmp's never stop, starting with tech house and followed by fast paced electro. Disc 2 keeps up the energy with house and electro throughout. Both discs feature some big tracks, such as the opening track on disc 1, the Vane Musgrave Peaked Mix of Headland's Nitefall, D. Ramirez's electro track Pleasure Me, and Dubfire's Casaplez Mix of Robbie Rivera's Float Away, which features Justine Suissa on vocals and is an absolute scorcher.If you're looking for a high energy mix, this is it on both discs. It's enough tech and electro energy to keep frenzied festival dancers moving for hours, and you'll probably be out of breath yourself by the end of disc 2! For a similar electro house adrenalin rush, check outM.O.S. Sessions: D. Ramirez.

The Summadayze festival is held annually in Australia during their summer (January) and most of these tracks are actually from 2006, as I believe this was first released on the excellent EQ Recordings label back in late '06. Disc 1 should be subtitled the best minimal and tech house of 2006, because it's pretty much a tracklisting full of all the best known minimal tracks of the past year. Even the lesser known tracks in between are just as stellar as some of the big ones, and there isn't an ounce of filler here. The only flaw would be the lack of any real mixing effort, as they are very loose track transitions. The mixing gets a little tighter on disc 2, where we get peppered with what may very well be the best set of electro house tracks ever. The energy and melodies are extremely fast paced, and while there aren't the well known tracks like on disc 1, a few you may have heard, and the rest will simply blow you away if you haven't.A lot of the tracks on disc 1 you may have already, if you have several '06 releases, but it's great to hear them play together in this one mix. If you haven't picked up much minimal in the past year, or you want to get rid of some lesser mixes, but like a lot of this big tunes, you can't do any better than having this one CD set in your collection. I'm sure you won't have a lot of what's on disc 2, as most of the tracks aren't on other comps that I've seen.This mix is very much like EQ's Electric 02, which had minimal and tech for disc 1, and electro on disc 2. If you are a minimal, electro, or EQ fan, this one is a do not miss. One last note, the track by Oxia is actually the superb Domino, and not the listed Change Works. It's an error on the CD, not just here on Amazon.

The Vision extended is the version that's going to make you move! Worth the price if it was the only track! The radio edit is decent, but way too short, and has lots of vocals cut out that are in the extended mix. The Uhrmacher mix is ok, but a little too slow for my liking. Thumbs way down for KMC (Benassi Bros.) for obtaining Sandy for their newest singles, and losing Dhany. What were they thinking???? Sandy's voice is horrible, yet Dhany's is ohhh soo smooth.

Finger Lickin' Records serves up a mix by their own A. Skillz, full of mostly all tracks from the past couple of years, with the exception of two new remixes: one by A. Skillz of his track Peaches (w/ Krafty Kuts featuring Droop Capone) and a Fort Knox Five remix of Ain't It Funky (A. Skillz & Krafty Kuts featuring Ashley Slater. Both of these new mixes are very good.You get disco funk, hip hop breaks, and a quirky collection of the label's groovier style breakbeat. It's a good mix for what it is, but fans of this label's true sound, would be better off with the Plump DJ's Saturday Night Lotion mix cd or the newest mix from this label in '06: Finger Lickin' presents Export 01, mixed by the Drumattic Twins. It's inexplicably not available on Amazon US, but should be as along with DJ Icey's Y4K, it's one of the best breaks mixes this year.Some of their label hits on here include Mind the Gap by the Drumattic Twins, Something Goin On by the Plump DJ's, Gimme the Breaks by Krafty Kuts featuring Kurtis Blow, and A. Skillz's Tricka Technology.If you are up for some fun, party style breakbeat, this quirky little CD is it!

Funky German nu jazz superstars Jazzanova bring together a whopping collection of current Sonar Kollektiv tracks. There's something for everyone on here, from hip hop, to nu jazz, to soulful jazz, to tech house. It's a great representation of what this very diverse and superb label is cranking out these days. They have always been at the top of the nu jazz scene, as well as sneaking in all other types of genres into their repertoire. From their top vocal diva Clara Hill, to tech house monsters me, to their main staple artists over the years, Wahoo, Slope, Capital A, and Fat Freddy's Drop, Jazzanova manages to uniquely mold everything to the point that even the near misses work.If you enjoy this, don't hesitate to seek out their 2004 mix called Mixing, as it's another superb mix of diverse and jazzy sounds.

Probably the best chill CD I've heard, and I don't usually like chillout much. Not many artists can produce very good trance sounds AND chillout to go along with it. The album is more chillout than trance, but there are a few really upbeat melodies like Tantrix, Highlander, and Transformation. The vocals on the album are very ethereal and easy on the brain.Alamanana is a rearrangement of their classic track Summersault. Summersault appears on the UK version of this album instead of Alamanana. I think the original is a tad better. Paul Oakenfold used it in his DJ sets.If you like some trancey sounds with your chill, take one of these and call me in the morning.

Ils, a name now synonymous with pure progressive breakbeat, delivers a stunning artist album featuring vocal tracks, instrumentals, and a few ambient/lounge breaks. From the guitar sounds of a great intro track, through track 5, we get a quick dose of two great instrumentals, including the hyper edged track, Feed the Addiction (at a Prodigy-like pace), and two of his vocal singles. The first, Angels, is actually his latest release (after Cherish) and features sinister dark breaks, being lightened up only by the smooth house vocals. I like it, but would have loved to hear it as an instrumental only. Check out some good remixes of it out there now by Teddy Tinkleman and Santos. Santos' Another Planet mix keeps it dark and moody, while Tinkleman lightens and funks it up.Tracks 6 & 7 are very multi-layered, and just when you thought the album is getting repititous, it takes you for an in the nick of time spin. More solid breaks follow, and the vocal track Precious is decent, but not on par with the previous two. We also get a few lounge tracks, but I am not big on this slower paced style.The last track is really the cream of the crop of the entire album. It's a stunning melodic track, which I wish was about 10 minutes longer than it is. Actually, if you want more of it, check out James Zabiela's 5 hour Australia mix he did this past fall, where he did a near 11 minute mash-up of Over My Head and Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence. It is a must hear masterpiece.Overall, a near perfect artist album by a leader in the breaks genre of house music. We need more from this master!

If you're a fan of the Plumpsters, you will not be disappointed by this artist/mix album (75% of the tracks are by the Plump DJ's, yet it's mixed). They fill in gaps between their own songs, with matching high energy vibes, and punishing breaks.The entire album is filled with electro and acid house, never getting too progressive or dark. It's funky house, injected with the tings and energy these guys are known for. There really are only two weak tracks out of 17, and no bad ones at all. My two least favorite were Dr. Dub (rather simple and really doesn't go anywhere) and Smartbomb (borders on cheese). The companion to the recently released single Dr. Dub is called Blackjack, which is sadly not on here, but I found to be more enjoyable than it's EP headliner.As for killer tracks, my favorite is the echoing beats of Redshift, followed by Hell Up in Harlem, and Acid Hustle. The best non-Plump track is easily their remix of the Freestylers Push Up, which is right near the culmination of the meat and potatoes of the mix, tracks 7-15.Bullet Train is already a smash, and as far as Get Kinky, I love the beat and fast pace, but I'm not completely sold on the recycled Missy Elliot lyrics.Overall, one to listen to straight through without any trouble at all. A clear winner for these Dj's of electro breaks.

You get 5 brand new tracks, 1 remake or an old track, and 14 singles which ATB has released over the past 7 years. Amazon is selling a few imports and this one, which appears to be the single disc US version. I have the original German release on Kontor, which comes with a Bonus DVD that has all his videos right up to the two new singles from this album, Believe in Me and Humanity. You also get photos, interviews, and the making of the Believe in Me video, and an alternate Belive in Me video.Most of the videos were on his DVD he released in 2004, except Long Way Home, which you could only get on that CD single; Marrakech, which was on the import No Silence limited edition set; and Ecstasy, which was on the US No Silence. If you buy the import, you won't get the DVD to play on your normal player, but maybe in your computer. If you are looking for a complete set of videos, and can play this PAL formatted DVD, this makes the import more attractive. If you already have most of his videos and don't have to have Marrackech or Believe in Me videos, you can just stick with this US copy, which is basically a best of, with some new tracks and edits.The first of the new singles is Believe in Me, sung by 4 Strings member Jan Loechel. It's a nice club/dance track, but I prefer the peppier versions on the CD single over the album version. The new Tiff Lacey voiced track, Humanity, is excellent, and while I haven't heard the remixes yet, the album version works just fine. It's a breakbeat/trance blend that Tiff sings her heart out on. Jan Leochel also sings an updated version of Let U Go, which I liked. It's a slower paced version that refreshes the song nicely.The 14 "best of" tracks are all his single releases, and they are all either radio edits or album versions. The radio edit of the new vocal remix of In Love With the DJ hasn't been on any other album, and the Here With Me radio edit was an internet exclusive, so even in the collection of past hits, there are some new perks.Over the past 7 years, no trance DJ/producer has been more prolific in releasing high quality vocal trance, instrumental trance, artist albums, and mix CD's than ATB. If you are a new fan, I would highly recommend this, just don't pass up some of is albums, thinking you are getting everything here, because you will miss out on a lot of great music (like one of my favorite instrumental trance tunes of all time -- Mysterious Skies off No Silence). Only his radio play releases are here. If you are a regular ATB fan, I am sure you are going to purchase this anyway!

Keep in mind you must firmly be interested in minimal to truly enjoy this solid mix, as it's a mellow, moody trip through a lot of similar sounding beats. It may be too repititious for the casual listener, and I admit it took me a second listen to really appreciate it better.The first 4 tracks are a great start with some groovy minimal, then it's into some spacey sounding techno with track 5. The middle of the mix features some excellent glitchy minimal, like track 9, Rio Besenresier, and then there's the hot melody of Matt John's the Rising Scope, which fades nicely into Butane's industrial techno track Next. Tracks 13-15 are the peak of the mix, in terms of BPM's as the pace really picks up here, until slowly dropping back down again. The end of the mix is full of some downtempo groovy house sounds, and Luciano fills nearly the entire CD using over 1 hour and 19 minutes for this mix.It's an interesting stroll through minimal and very good listen.

This is one of those top heavy mixes, where it seems most of the good flow of tracks are in the first half. The second half, while having some decent tracks scattered through, are cluttered with too many mediocre or weak ones. The first part of the mix is a stunning line-up of high energy techno, only to be brought down by the last half. It's a shame the flow couldn't continue, as I really like a majority of what's on here.

There seems to be a pattern here in the world of Doctor Who. Those stories that fall right before the final episode of a certain doctor's reign seem to always take on dark, serious tones, and usually stray from the lighter material found in earlier episodes of the season: The Keeper of Traken, Planet of Fire, Terror of the Vervoids (although this whole season was dark), The Curse of Fenric, and Boom Town. This one is no exception.Right off the bat, we get a Titanic like feel going in, knowing the fate of the occupants of this Mars outpost. This gloomy episode features a strong supporting cast, which certainly helps the viewer on this ride toward impending doom. Unlike another reviewer, I did feel it still had tension and suspense. Even though we were given the premise and apparent ending right up front, you just never know what the doctor was going to do, and how he may have affected the outcome. An enjoyable watch, right up to the surprise ending, but a little darker than I would have liked. I enjoyed the previous two specials a lot more.

I saw this CD at the local music store several times before finally deciding to buy it. The track listing didn't jump out and grab me and I was afraid it was going to be "Live" with tons of fans screaming through tracks. Boy, was I wrong!The tracks are nothing short of spectacular, with the best blend of house and trance I've ever encountered on one CD. The first half of the track features some great hands in the air, high NRG house, and the second half dips into some superb melodic trance territory. The last track, an Agnelli and Nelson remix of the 8 year old trance classic Global Phases by Jon the Dentist, is worth the price alone. Best of all, Live mixed means merely that Tall Paul mixed the CD "live" with no mixing or editing done aftwerward. There is no crowd noise to be had anywhere in the mix!Don't miss this cd, it's one of the best CD's released this year, and of the last several years. A superb one disc DJ mix collection. Whether you like trance, hard house, or both, it's all here in supreme, rare form.

This is a quality mix on the Kompakt label, by German DJ Tobias Thomas. He takes us on a deep, and initially dark journey starting with some ambient techno, then minimal techno, and eventually into some groovy tech house. The melodies really begin to pick up halfway through, and perk up the initially slower and atmospheric pace he started out with.The opening ambient tracks is superb, as is the underwater, bubbly, minimal sounds of Johannes Heil's Aquarius. The only lowpoint is the final two tracks, which are two weak vocal tracks that don't add anything to the mix, especially the cover of Fleetwood Mac's Dreams. Stevie Nicks sang an updated version with Deep Dish in 2005 (which was actually after this version was initially released) and anyone but her on vocals just doesn't cut it. The background music and this remix version sound really good, but the vocals make it sound awkward. This would have worked VERY well as an instrumental. I like to stop the mix after track 12, which is a fine Tech House remix by Ada.Barring the last two tracks, it's well worth buying for a classy and intelligent progression through techno.

First of all, I am not sure why I even purchased this, as after buying the 40 track Volume 3 of this series, I was quite disappointed to find only 6 superb tracks on there. If that wasn't reason enough, I saw that every track on this 2 disc set was very short (that's why they can fit 40). Then, I notice this song called F U Right Back on here, but figured it was a clean version because there was no warning sticker, and it is listed as a Radio Edit. Well, I'm lucky I was playing this while the kids were in bed, because this track is actually a follow up to Eamon's atrocious house song F...You I Don't Want You Back. It is very explicit, very housey, and very silly. It in no way should ever be on any trance compilation (and doesn't deserve to be on any CD period).And true to form there are only about 5 or 6 exceptional trance anthems on here, including Benassi Bros. featuring Dhany (thankfully they used her instead of the dreadful sounding Sandy) on Hit My Heart, Narcotic Thrust's I Like It, and the best track on here (however not the best version of this song), DJ Tatana featuring Jael - Always on My Mind. It is a very hard to find track from trance's best Female DJ. However, it is a very shortened version and one should seek out the 7-minute+ Ronski Speed Remix.The remainder of the tracks contain some very, very cheesy songs, that I wouldn't wish on anyone to even have to listen to once.There really isn't one reason to ever purchase this trashy CD (and yes it is trashy and has stooped to an all time low by including that horrible explicit house track with no explicit warning sticker), while there are a few nice tracks, you can find them elsewhere and much better, longer versions.After this, I will NEVER purchase another Cream of Female Vocal Trance CD again. You think I would have got it after Vol. 3!

That quote was Arthur Daley reassuring Terry McCann that the minding business is still for him. Minder, one of the best British shows in their tv history, has not had a region 1 release to date, so I am not sure why it is even listed here numerous times on Amazon, even though they all say "unavailable". Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, and George Cole as Arthur Daley were teamed up for 7 seasons from 1979-1987. It ran from 1979-1985 for series 1-6, and then had 3 years off before resuming one final year with McCann, on season 7. Seasons 8-10 resumed with Arthur's nephew, played by Gary Webster, taking over for Terry McCann, but the chemistry of Waterman and Cole were what made this show such a phenomenon. The later years, while receiving good reviews, could never be the same without Terry on the job.Seasons 1 & 2 didn't receive high ratings on TV, and it wasn't until series 3 that the show finally became a hit. They even went back and replayed seasons 1 & 2 after series 3 went over so well. Aside from a few dull early episodes in Season 1, the rest of the episodes through season 6 were solid entertainment. Most episodes revolved around Arthur finding some nearly crooked job for him and Terry to make a nice little earner, only for him to take most of the prize money in the end, citing expenses, overhead, and other preposterous reasons to con Terry out of his share. Terry did get back at Arthur in several episodes, and more than once our lovable rogue con man ended up on the losing side of a profit.Terry McCann was an ex-boxer and ex-con, two reasons to make him the best minder, or bodyguard, in London. He often squared off against the right hand men and much-bigger-than-he hired hands of London underworld's most crooked citizens. Of course, he would always find the time to romance the leading ladies who were tied up in his latest job. Arthur's earners had Terry doing everything from minding Arab millionares to minding women's dresses.The comedic antics of George Cole really made him a legend of British TV. Everyone during those years, and even now, knows who Arthur Daley is. Arthur and Terry usually hung out at the Winchester Club, run by Arthur's old mate, Dave. He hated it when Arthur would bring his business inside and rough up his club. Dave was the only other regular character in Minder, besides Terry and Arthur. There were also the minor characters of Des, Terry's car thief friend, the on-the-take Inspector Rycott, and the righteous Inspector Chisolm, who all made numerous appearances in the show.There were two Region 2 Specials released on DVD, along with the movie, Minder on the Orient Express. Seasons 1-10 are out on Region 2 DVD, and if you can find the now out of print Region 4 DVD's from Australia, they made seasons 1-3, but featured uncut episodes with their original ad break captions, and on seasons 1 & 3, you got none other than George Cole featured on some audio commentary. The British Region 2 dvd's are very short on extras. I am not sure it will ever get a region 1 release, so you may have to seek out the foreign discs, if you have the capability to play them. If you do, you will reap the rewards of getting to see arguably one of the best British tv shows of all time.

This has to be the scariest and best low budget, B-movie horror flick of all time. It starts out a bit slow, with some silly paintball action and sophomoric banter, but gets off and running quickly enough when they start their ride through the woods and one of them thinks they see a girl running amongst the trees. Later, the boys come across an empty house. They witness an unknown female getting murdered on the TV in the barn, knowing that it was filmed in the very spot they stood, just minutes before they got there. It's one of the most original and scary sequences in any horror film I've ever seen. Lots of other truly frightening scenes in this one.Having watched countless horror films in my day, there are very few that actually creep me out, but this is one of them. I remember renting it back in the late 80's and being completely surprised at what I saw. A true cult classic, The Zero Boys is well worth adding to your horror collection.

Unfortunately for US fans, to this day, the stunning, continuously mixed artist album by Thomas Schumacher titled Home is not available here on Amazon. It was released over a year ago in June of 2006 Schumacher's own Spiel-Zeug Schallplatten label out of Germany. It's a sin that it's not out over here, as it's one of the all time best techno artist albums. Fortunately his new mix CD has made it to these shores, in the 5th installment of this series. You do get two tracks from Home, but I highly suggest seeking out the entire album. Now, onto this mix review:I felt sort of like a contestant on Name That Tune, because after only 5 notes of the first track, I new instantly that this was going to be one hot mix. Nothing really prepared me for the shock of track 3, however, when I was dumbfounded by what I heard on Thomas's new track Rising. A mindbending bassline came out of nowhere, and at such a slow pace, it seemed like forever for the next wave to hit, which left me thinking what the hell was that I just heard come through the speaker? The drawn out bassline in this track is nothing short of genius, and just another high quality track to add to his repertoire.It's all high energy techno through the first part of the mix, and only slows down slightly in the middle, before swooshing through the latter half with Schumacher's electro-fied techno courtesy of his own stuff, along with tracks from his group Elektrochemie, and fellow collaborator Stephan Bodzin.This is a deliciously innovative mix from Schumacher, proving that there's still lots of surprises and new twists to be had in the techno genre. A very high energy pace, not unlike his artist album I mentioned earlier. Easily, one of the best techno mixes of the year and not to be missed.

1. A great lead actor: Michael J. Fox in the prime of his career, really drives this film, and makes it as enjoyable as it could possibly get. I doubt any other actor of the time could have pulled this one off. He plays someone trying to be the yuppie that Alex P. Keaton strived to be in the hit TV show Family Ties.2. Excellent supporting cast: Robert Jordan and Margaret Whitton as Fox's uncle and aunt by marriage; and a good sidekick: John Pankow (Ira in TV's Mad About You) as Fox's mailroom, lowest on the office totem pole counterpart, who played off Fox very well. I did find Helen Slater to be a little cold.3. Euro chic cinematography: With Carlo Di Palma (Blow-Up, The Appointment, Hannah & Her Sisters) on board, the look of this film was several notches above other similar films of the timeframe. Just look at some of the interesting shots in the film, including a scene where you see Robert Jordan in the mirror of a restaurant, while he's talking to Helen Slater with his back to the camera. Little stylish elements like this really make it an enjoyable rewatch in the present day.This one never went overboard with the sexual antics, and remained very innocent compared to the huge lot of other 80's R-rated romps. It was also a few years ahead of just about every other teen film of the day, and I mean it in the sense that everyone else was in High School, while here we have a young man's journey on a career path after college. This would also make it appealing to young adults who were otherwise too old for the John Hughes type movies.The DVD is definitely worth adding to your 80's film collection, especially considering it's low price. The extras are the trailer, cast bios, and some production notes. Presentation is widscreen and the picture quality is high.Some say it was very contrived, and I can't dispute that, but surely you can't overlook the entertainment value of this rather unique, yuppie, 80's gem. A film truly tailored for the 80's MJF.

Hell (L'Enfer) features Francois Cluzet as the husband who literally flies into a jealous rage at the suspicion that his wife is cheating on him with the town mechanic. With Emmanuelle Beart as his wife, it's not very hard at all to imagine someone insanely jealous over their wife's looks. This movie is full of iconic images of one of the most beautiful acresses in cinema history, including one where Cluzet secretly tails her and sees her putting on lipstick in a window reflection.There isn't the normal suspense associated with some other Chabrol films, particularly because no upfront crimes are committed, and the only person in turmoil is the husband with himself. It doesn't bring too much tension to the film, until we near the end.Cluzet's jealousy hits rock bottom when he assembles with family and friends to watch one of their amateur films. First, this film within a film shows innocent interaction with Beart and the mechanic (he helps her remove her shoes), and then it turns to scenes from Cluzet's mind (the mechanic kissing Beart's feet), until he goes ballistic in front of everyone. Some people criticized this character's descent into jealousy, but I found it to be quite believable.lt's worth one viewing, but it's nowhere near Chabrol's best. It's just not a juicy enough thriller or steady enough drama, to keep us pinned for the duration or wanting a second viewing. This new Kimstim Collection is the 2nd DVD release of the film, and this one features select scenes with audio commentary by Chabrol.

After watching this above average crime drama from Chabrol, I was pretty mystified, and not by the film's mystery, but rather where was all the emotion in the characters of this film? We have a heinous crime committed at the beginning of the film, uncovered infidelity, and a second suspicious death, yet all the while, the people in this film are acting like they are strolling through one of Rohmer's non-violent, talky, morality films. From the very low key female police inspector, to her face full of food sidekick, to the man accused of this young girl's death (who also believes his wife is cheating), to the cheating wife whose husband may be a brutal killer, no one is acting like they are really caught up in the tension filled, life scarring, emotional situations that have occurred in this film.Getting back to the very soft spoken police inspector: she is played by Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, who I just watched in Francois Ozon's 5x2, and judging by her dynamic emotional range portrayed in that performance, it further supports my gripe with the character's lack of emotion in this film. She appears like an amateur actress in this one, even though having been acting for several years prior, and an Oscar worthy one in 5x2. Sandrine Bonnaire was also underused, as judging by her extaordinary performance in Chabrol's own La Ceremonie.Whether the script called for the characters to be this nonchalant, or it was Chabrol's direction, I found it hard to accept any suspense or tension that may have been present. I probably would have had these characters seemed to care more about what is taking place.Comparing it to Chabrol's other suspense films of this period, L'Enfer, La Ceremonie, and Merci Pour Le Chocolat, I found it more watchable and more enjoyable than L'Enfer, but not up to par with the performances in La Ceremonie and my favorite of all of these, Merci Pour Le Chocolat.Don't get me wrong, it's an interesting story, with a typical Chabrol ending, I just wish the actors acted like they were REALLY in the middle of all this.

Take the concept of the Sodor Engine Wash (two pressure yielding, rubber washing posts that you guide the train through with a knob) and add lights, faux water, a spinning wheel, and much more color, and you have the Sodor Scrub and Shine. It's a very solid piece, considering it has lots of plastic. When you guide the train through with the knob, it begins to make one sound, then as the train passes through, another sound, and then a drying sound when the train hits the end of the line. You then press the button to pop the train up back onto the track.On one connector piece end, you have to lift the Scrub and Shine up and place it onto this small piece of track, which contrasts with the normal ease of connecting Thomas track. Little ones may get frustrated having to pick this big thing up all the time to connect it.One other note is that if you leave the tester/store display strip sticking out of the bottom, it remains in store test mode. This means that when you press the button that normally releases the train when it is at the end of it's wash, you hear the entire wash sounds go through their sequence. When you pull it out, you have to make the train go through to hear every sound, and the button only releases the train now. I am almost sorry I pulled it out, as it seemed more fun to my son when he just pressed the button once to hear everything without having to make the train go through!It's a fun piece, but I can't give it 5 stars due to it's heavy use of plastic, and the fact you have to place it on top of one of it's connecting tracks. It's still solid with the plastic, but it just doesn't have that classic Thomas wooden look.

I would much rather have had the actors improvise, as the written lines of dialogue in this film were what I found to be the most unoriginal, unexciting cheese one could ever imagine. I can't believe the actors appearing in the film didn't drop the script and run when they did a read through. Maybe they did, and this is the 2nd or 3rd set of actors they had to use! Who knows, but I can't believe the senseless drivel I had to sit through watching this.Right from the opening scene, which was way overdone, with all the debris from the morning after of the 80's reunion party. I think someone could party for one month straight and still be hard pressed to leave as much of a disaster area as the filmmaker's portrayed this house and yard. In fact, the rest of the scenario involving these people is as believable as the rubbish shown on the property.All the way around, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.

Another book by Parr for a British television program on style and decorating. It features interiors of rooms, people in them, and close-ups of room objects and details, all captured in typical Parr fashion. I wouldn't hesitate grabbing this one if you are a Parr fan, especially since it is now getting harder to find.

So far, I've seen maybe 7 Chabrol films (older and recent ones) and this is easily the most enjoyable one yet. Actually, I wasn't expecting much, after some mixed reviews here, but found the DVD for a decent price used at a local store, and gave it a shot. While I think Chabrol films are all well above average, and in terms of Amazon ratings, you can always bank on a 4 star rating, but this one had a little more. I really enjoyed watching these characters, and this little plot they've become nestled into is very intriguing. I think it helps that all the actors, especially Huppert, play their parts to a tee.Stunningly beautiful, but unknown to the US actress, Anna Mouglalis, serves as the centerpiece of the film, which revolves around the question of whether or not she was switched at birth with the Polonski's baby boy, who was born on the same day. Pianist Andre Polonski is initially told by nurses that he has a girl, only to find out they made a mistake and he has a son. Mouglalis's character, Jeanne, who also becomes a pianist, goes to meet the father that may have been hers, and sets off a jealousy issue with Andre's new wife, Mika, played by Huppert. This triggers emotions from the past, and poses a question about the death of Andre's first wife. It also sets up one of the best scenes in the film: a moving recollection by Andre's son, Guillame, about the night his mother died.Upon Jeanne's first encounter with Mika, some suspense immediately builds, in a very stylish scene where Jeanne is looking at a picture of Andre's first wife, a near reflection of herself as she resembles her, and sees Mika purposely spill a thermos of chocolate on the floor. This gets Jeanne to purposely dip her sleeve into it and later have her forensic lab boyfriend analyze it and find that it contains a tranquilizer.The direction of the film, building suspense, dry wit, and superb acting performances, all make for an extremely satisfying French film. It is much more lighter than other Chabrol films, and more dialogue driven, without much culmination in the suspense. The violence found in his other films is nowhere to be found. It's more on the black comedy side, then a true suspense thriller, and nothing points to this more than the subtle humor found in the ending. From the low key remarks by Andre (remember that he's just had some sleeping medicine as well), to what happens to Jeanne and Andre's son, to the revealing scene where Huppert gets up from the couch, only to find she was just resting her head in the center of a black afghan, knitted in the form of spider web.I don't think the film is to be taken as seriously as other Chabrol thrillers, and thus, the somewhat abrupt ending shouldn't be frowned upon for coming up short. I thought it was satisfying enough, and ends the film quite nicely. Let's face it, French films don't EVER end like Amercian films do. I think it's a unique and tidy end to one delicious film! My only gripe was not how it ended, rather when it ended. I would have loved to see more interaction between the characters before it reached it's conclusion. I'll just have to watch it again!

If you don't know your Mockney slang (Cockney rhyming slang), you might have some difficulty following one of the grittiest cop shows on either side of the Atlantic. Long before NYPD Blue was catching the attention of the FCC censors, the Sweeney (Scotland Yard's Flying Squad of plain clothes detectives) was thrust upon UK viewers in the early to mid 70's, with some harsh language, occasional topless girls, and the over the top violent antics of the fiercest cops in England.John Thaw, as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, perfectly fills what is possibly his best known role, apart from Inspector Morse. Dennis Waterman, as Regan's partner, Sergeant George Carter, is equally talented in fisticuffs, which would come in handy in Waterman's next series Minder, playing bodyguard for hire Terry McCann, which would be his best known role.Regan often twisted the rules of the law to apprehend his criminals, usually convincing the apprehensive Carter to help. Regan was often in trouble with his superiors, and was constantly under scrutiny from internal affairs. The show lasted 4 seasons, and ended with Regan actually getting ... well, I won't give it away!Apart from the double disc set of the 2 late 70's Sweeney big screen films, which is avaiable on Amazon, the 4 seasons of the show have not been available in the US. All 4 sets are available in the UK, with some great extras. If you have the capability to play region 2 PAL discs, don't hesitate to pick up a season of one of the best cop shows in TV history (any country).

I'm a little skeptical about this new Robotz line, as most of the extra little robots you get with the figures are pretty boring and sadly jack the price up on the figure. However, this extra robot you get with Gil is a lot of fun, as it's on all 4's and when you press the button (which is very awkwardly underneath the tail end) it "walks" along and makes a mechanized sound, as all 4 paddle feet flip over and over. It's the only Robotz robot that my son gave a second look to, as all the other ones in the line he cares little about and only wants the rescue hero.Would be 5 stars if not for the button you press to start the robot being on the underside, and the fact that despite the photo showing Gil holding his helmet, it is permanently attached to his body via a cord, so it barely comes off his head and hangs to the side.

This is the second walking robot figure that I've had break. We've had dozens upon dozens of RH figures, vehicles, and accessories, and I've only ever had 3 things break, and two of them were the Walking Robotz line.The other reviewer is incorrect about this walking robot, CMent, hooking up and talking with Jack Hammer. There are two lines in the Robotz series: Walking and Talking. The talking figures are robots that have 2 buttons, do not move, and they have a wire which hooks up to the back of the RH figure. The walking line do not talk or hook up to the hero figure with a wire. They have on off switches and a button to begin the walking feature. This robot is suppose to move forward while opening and closing it's front scoop section. After only a week, the forward motor broke, and it now just stays in one place while the front opens and closes.As for the figure, it's the exact same one as the PowerMax Jack Hammer, with a bad color scheme repaint. I would recommend getting the talking Robotz Jack Hammer over this one, as we've never had a problem with the talking ones breaking. Even the Lava Squad Jack Hammer (also a repaint of the PowerMax Jack) is more exciting than this one.

At first listen, tracks 1-4 on disc 1 start out as a decent afterclub house sound. Not too fast, not too chill, and groovy enough to keep your interest. However, the same sounds continue on and on and every track seems to be a repetitive take on the last one. By track 5 and 6, I was really bored, as no tempo changed, the melodies sounded the same, and the disc really never goes anywhere. Unfortunately, it's like this throughout the entire first disc, and continues to the really flat disco house track 2 on disc 2.Track 3 on Disc 2 is Nic Fanciulli's alias Buick Project with At the Rave. The original is a stunner, found on Zabiela's Utilities, however, I found the Electric Press remix too electro to keep my interest. Track 4 is just plain bad, but finally, we get to some exciting music with track 5: Wanna Get Wet by Soul Mekanik. The mix finally gets into some good uptempo electro and progressive house, and things really get rockin' with track 10, Nic's own Squirreled, which is a hot tech house track. Following that, is a super Trentemoller remix of the quirky vocal track Coincidance, and then another odd, but good tech track, Mandarine Girl. It's too bad he didn't get more into the tech side of house, because I think you will agree that tracks 10-12 are the hottest part of either disc of this mix.Overall, way too much downtempo, boring house throughout the entire first disc and into the 2nd. There are some hot electro and tech house tracks on disc 2, but they come way too late to save this mix.

This CD will literally rip your speakers apart if you're not careful! If you are looking for the hardest hitting breaks around, look no further. It's a trippy ride through Tayo's dub/reggae style breaks. For the most part, it sounded good, and the reggae sounds appear in some way in about half of the tracks, with the rest being standard breakbeat. There's a very cool rap track on here too. A few of the latest breaks artists found here include The Breakfastaz, Aquaksy, and Deekline & Wizard.The CD cover is totally different than pictured. It's orange and features a silhouette of Tayo with large lettering.If you are into breaks, and can stand a decent helping of reggae, you won't be disappointed with this extremely hard hitting mix. If you want your breaks without reggae, I would get a hold of Finger Lickin' Export 01, mixed by the Drumattic Twins. It's my favorite breaks mix thus far in '06.

I stumbled across this first season set, having never seen it, and thought it was similar to Coupling. I took a chance and what I found that while very unlike Coupling, it had it's own style that keeps you watching. This is primarily a drama, but it does have it's share of laugh out loud scenes.Every one of the 8 episodes on Season 1 has all sorts of scenarios and crazy new things developing. The one thing I just noticed after watching it all, that except for maybe Donna and Ian's son that they originally gave up, there are really no innocent, completely likable characters. I mean someone is usually ending up cheating, lying, or deceiving someone else! No one, and I mean no one is anywhere near sainthood in this one!This close knit team and their families is a very interesting watch, with spot on performance by every actor in their roles. The German Team Manager use to play Alistair in As Time Goes By and was very funny in that. While he takes on a more serious role in this, he is again completely fun to watch. The actress who played Judi Dench's daughter in As Time Goes By also makes an appearance as a physician.All the characters get into so many heated confrontations, deceptions, and flirtations, you have to just keep watching and watching to see what will develop. Another exciting program from the British. Keep 'em coming!

The video on here is very cool, with Karin, the vocalist, floating through mid air in surreal scenes, with milk dripping off her feet. All the remixes are pretty good, and the original song alone is getting a lot of mainstream radio play. What is really the standout here is the Trentemoller remix. He is the hottest house artist and producer of the moment and his tech house take of this track is on fire. It's a churning, dark, tech remix, and when Karin sings "sudden explosions", Trentemoller follows suit in adding his own explosive sounds at just the right moments. When he flutters out the vocals for nearly 2 minutes deep into the track, it really hits it's peak. A lot of dance and mix compilations are picking this track up, but you will want to get it here, in it's full, 7:00+ entirety. This remix is a Do Not Miss track of the year!

After Parr's two major Black and White books, A Fair Day, and Bad Weather, came two of his best color works, The Last Resort, and what I consider to be his best work, The Cost of Living. While the Last Resort captured Britains vacationing in their own country, The Cost of Living seemed to capture everything else in their lives. From political parties and tea parties, to shopping and tourism, all are shot documentary style, with everyone seemingly unaware that Parr is there.A colorful look at British social life, capturing true expressions and events in the lives of the middle class. Another out of print Parr book, so grab when you see it!

This one's clearly targeted at a male audience, as I can't see how much enjoyment of female viewer would get out of our male character conquering 101 members of the opposite sex. The premise is a very strange one, with our main lead getting plucked by some futuristic, secret office who presents him with a list of all the females he has ever slept with, and the many more he will end up sleeping with. We never fully understand how or why this is happening, but it puts the movie into one big set up for crude joke after crude joke of how our lead gets hooked up with all the girls on his list. It features some very funny scenarios, while many more end up rather awkward and flat.The best moments in the film are when our main character settles in to the 101st name on the list, Winona Ryder, a near-serial killer of sorts. I say near serial killer, as she merely drugs her victims and puts them into comas. These scenes feature a glimpse of how good the movie could have been, if the first 75% of the film was simply rewritten.I'd say if you're of the male DVD viewing variety, you may find a hilarious moment or two in this male having sex with many women romp. If you're a female viewer, I'd strongly caution you stay away from this clearly sexist farce.

P2, while not the best choice for a movie title, is a throwback horror flick, with really only 2 leads in a cat vs. mouse scenario. All the action takes place in the lower basement parking levels of a Manhattan high rise. As our female lead, Angela Bridges, attempts to simply leave work and drive to her sister's house for Christmas Eve, she quickly realizes that this task will become the hardest of her life. She's met by the lonely, psychotic night security guard, who has Christmas Eve plans of his own, and unbeknownst to Angela, they perversely involve her.While I know the budget may have prevented it, the story would have benefitted by some chases within the office building itself, but the action remains primarily in the lower parking levels, the elevator, and the security office. It's still one thrilling sequence after another, that is, once the first, more dramatic 45 minutes have elapsed. Those early scenes tend to drag on too long, without enough interesting dialogue to keep them so extended. However, it's definitely nothing to hit the fast forward button about, as the leads pull of two great performances, which keep you interested and watching, even during the slow build-ups.The cat vs. mouse game is played out here very well, with chase after chase, both on foot, in an elevator shaft, and also one pitting car vs. car. It's also high on gore content, for those not too squeamish. Some, may be put off by the rather high level of displayed violence and gore. The cinematography is suprisingly good for such claustrophobic spaces, and both the DVD widescreen transfer and the film itself are remarkably crisp. There are 3 featurettes ranging from 3 to 12 minutes.Overall, an enjoyable ride through realm of a psycho chasing the girl victim. Well acted, well presented, and a fine modern entry in a horror genre so tainted lately by terrible flicks.

The biggest, chunkiest figures, with the huge backpacks and massive battery operated power tools are the PowerMax team! There are 10 figures in all, plus the big remote control robot, URV. I predict this line will go down as the best of the RH series, and be the most collectible in the future. The 10 figures are:Billy Blazes with double axesJake Justice with battering ramRocky Canyon with power tow wenchJack Hammer with circular sawBen Choppin with chain sawRock Miner with double drillAriel Flyer with skateboardSam Sparks with water sprayer (fake water)Hal E. Copter with aerial backpackMatt Medic with power liftThey are already all going for ten to twenty bucks on the secondary market and will only escalate, so get them while you still can!!! There is really only one drawback to this line. The backpacks and tools were so heavy, it's difficult to get the figures to always stay standing with them attached.

This is a very nice collection of shots, mostly of people driving, apparently taken from a vehicle driving beside them. It was commisioned by Parr for a British Television show on motoring. The expressions caught on the driver's and passenger's faces is typical Parr style, and there are even some humorous quotes to go along with each photo. I believe there is even a video copy floating around in out-of-print video land of the show it was based on. This book seems to now be out of print, and with most of Parr's older out of print titles, they just seem to keep elevating in price, so grab it while you still can.

This was one of the later 70's episodes, which featured inserts of the Brown Hornert cartoon shorts, rather than the musical breaks featured in the early 70's shows. This Easter themed show starts out with the Gang rushing to watch the Brown Hornet and his spacey Easter heroics, before settling back down into a story about Rudy playing a practical joke that lands old Mudfoot in the hospital, and the Gang coming to terms with how to deal with it. It's more about goodwill than the Easter Bunny, but they manage to decorate some eggs in the meantime.All in all, a worthwhile show that kids today should love. Since it's touch upon the Easter holiday is light, this special can be enjoyed anytime of the year. It's only a half hour show, with a find the Easter Bunny game as an extra, but it's offered at a low price. I think it's a must have for Fat Albert fans both new and old!

Other mix series usually swap DJ's for every other mix, or sometimes it's the same DJ on the first disc, and then a different one for every disc 2. However, Sven V&auml;th has taken upon himself to contiually mix his own 2 disc set in his now long running Sound of the Season mix series. With number 7, he comes out with his trademark, heavy hitting techno for disc 1, then lightens it up slightly with some tech house on disc 2. He lets a lot of tracks play very long, like Audion's Mouth to Mouth (which is itself an epic track to begin with), and culminating disc 2 with the stunning Middle Eastern vibe track India in Me by Cobblestone Jazz.If you're looking for more jarring techno from Sven, this is another weighty installment in his mix series. By the way, the cover on Amazon is wrong, and the back cover artwork shown here is really what the cover looks like. Also, Amazon lists Konstantin Raudive as the artist on track 4, but it's actually by an artist named Oliver Ho, who goes by the name Raudive, and has nothing to do with Konstantin. This is actually my least favorite track on either disc, as the distorted child's voice just makes for one annoying track, even though the musical portion of the track is strong. One last note, the CD has an error in that it lists the Trentemller track as Nam Nam, when it's actually Killer Kat.

Somehow, my review of this went under the wrong Euphoria CD, so here it is in the right spot:This is like a best of trance EVER compilation, and it's worth it alone to hear all these classic trance anthems meshed into one! It's nuts hearing Will I? going right into 9PM Til I come!!! It's like being at a the best trance club on the planet and just hearing all the best stuff being played!Matt Darey is one of the best remixers around and it's nice to have him spinning all these superb tracks. Anyone who doesn't like this CD, cannot like the genre of trance.To the reviewer who said if you like Digweed, Deep Dish, or Nick Warren, you won't like this, YOU ARE EXACTLY right as all those people are more progressive trance/house, which this IS NOT!!!This is a CD for classic trance lovers everywhere!! Forget about the tracks being old, as other than that super slammin' track here or there that comes out every year, there aren't many trance anthems coming out that can surpass these tracks. They are NEVER played out!

Allien, usually known for mixing up her mix cd's with some unique or sneaky twist in the musical style, goes straightforward this time with a sumptuous feast of techno. She takes a few dips in tempo here and there, but it's mostly a fast paced listen, with lots of great melodies in her track selections, and two very good vocal tracks.She mixed this on vinyl, and the only real flaw, as another reviewer pointed out, is the rough transition between tracks 7 and 8. One very minor issue on an otherwise perfect minimal and techno set. Joins Adam Beyer'sFabric 22, Ivan Smagghe'sFabric 23, and Matthew Dear'sFabric 27as top, 5-star techno entries in the Fabric series.

Without giving away the ending, this film does feel very contrived throughout, but it's all leading to a thought provoking and somewhat fulfilling conclusion. Along the way, we get powerful performances from Christian Slater, and Elisha Cuthbert, that tend to take our mind off the absurdity of some of the plot intricacies, which include Slater interacting with digitally altered goldfish and hummingbirds; many over the top, stereotypical supporting characters; and seemingly unrealistic and out of place props within the sets. The pacing of the film moves along at just a steady enough speed for us to go with the flow of what's being presented, and not become caught up with whether the characters' actions are plausible. It will all make sense once the credits roll.Bob Maconel is the geeky loner played by Slater, and it's easily one of the best performances of his career. In many films, this type of character would receive some sort of pity from the audience, and a degree of likability, but not in Slater's case. I believe it was the film's intention to not have this person gain any acceptance, and Slater pulls this aspect of the character off to a tee. He remains the secluded, picked on office worker with suicidal and homicidal tendencies, without ever becoming anything more.Supporting roles are minimal, with the most noteworthy being William H. Macy in prime form as Slater and Cuthbert's boss. The cinematography is crisp and many daylight and well lit scenes pull away from the dark tones of the film, and lead viewers away from any dreary feeling a story like this could convey.Overall, it's a very entertaining and unique twist on such oft covered plots such as the picked on office worker snapping, the nerd obsessing over the prom queen, and the question of pulling the plug on a quadriplegic. It's depressing topics covered in a rather entertaining way, with a very suprising turn from a veteran actor who has never quite been taken seriously throughout his career.There's two alternate endings in the special features section, with both of them running along nearly the same path of events as the original ending, but taking very abrupt and different turns right before the fade to credits. It's amazing that any of the other two could have been dropped in without taking much impact away from the entire movie. It really shows the strength of this 4 star film.

Since Shanghai recently came out, it's hard to throw heaploads of praise to this Miami CD, without noting that it is a notch below Nick Warren's near perfect set. I still give it 5 stars and it's a clear winner.Miami is defintely closer to the pure, funky side of house, rather than the deeper progressive stuff Nick Warren plays, but I guess you could call most of this progressive house too. A lot of it is soulful and has some disco vibes. I don't like all groovy, disco sounding house, and tracks 4 and 5 on disc 1 are two examples on the style I do not like. Aside from that, the rest of CD1 is astonishing, starting out with the crazy track Thermal, that glides through like a vintage 80's electro tune, reminding me a lot of Herbie Hancocks classic, Rock It. The few vocal tracks that follow on this disc are not repetitive or cheesy, and are spliced in at just the right times. Track 7 is a 1980 disco classic, and it's amazingly fresh sounding today. It supposedly took Danny 7 years to track this one down on vinyl, and I thank him for finding it and sharing it with us.The groove slows down a bit at the end of this disc, but keep in mind, the energy level of the entire cd never gets to a dance floor frenzy stage. It will keep you head bopping all night, as the beats are smooth, just never too fast. I would not call it chill, as it's several BPMs above that, but overall a very sexy, afterparty sound, not unlike Deep Dish's two afterclub Toronto mixes.Disc 2 starts out with a track I am not too fond of, but it's quickly forgotten by track 2, and the rest of the disc keeps an incredible flow going of great house melodies. It delves deeper into progressive house than disc 1. As if you couldn't tell, I'm a trance fan, and it was nice to see Ben Lost make an appearance in the form of Ashtrax, on track 13, the only real trance sounding track on here.A very well themed, and well mixed set. I am sure it was initially at the top of everyone's list of house mixes this year, and rightfully so, however he has since been one-upped by Nick Warren (can't be too hard on Danny though, as Shanghai is going down as one of the best ever). Even still, I would not miss this great house collection.

Miami is defintely closer to the pure, funky side of house, rather than the deeper progressive stuff Nick Warren plays, but I guess you could call most of this progressive house too. A lot of it is soulful and has some disco vibes. I don't like all groovy, disco sounding house, and tracks 4 and 5 on disc 1 are two examples on the style I do not like. Aside from that, the rest of CD1 is astonishing, starting out with the crazy track Thermal, that glides through like a vintage 80's electro tune, reminding me a lot of Herbie Hancocks classic, Rock It.

This long box edition is actually a fold out book, and not the boxes GU use to issue, which would always be a hassle to open at either end. The super wide book focuses on people and life in Miami and is worth picking up to add to the experience this incredible mix offers. The only downside is it's not as portable as the normal issue.A very well themed, and well mixed set. I would not miss this great house collection.

You get a decent vehicle and water tower prop for the money, but you must know you need to purchase the larger Thomas set, which comes with a full set of track, or the deluxe Thomas set (the priciest one with the tunnel and bridge). On it's own, you only get a section of track and can't use it as a real train on it's tracks. I've seen the straight tracks pieces sold individually in the Lego City line, which are compatible, but you won't be able to connect them fully without curved track from the Thomas set. I am not sure if there are curved track available from the Lego City line.

The Thomas set comes with 16 pieces of track, while most of the other train and accessory packs only come with a few pieces. You have to either start with this set, or buy the more expensive all inclusive set, which is at least double this one in price, but if you were to get this one and all the add on sets, the large set would save you some cash, and net you a lot of track.I bought this set and then found come Duplo City train track packs, which came with 6 more pieces of straight track. I believe all of the track in this set is curved, so getting the straight add-on packs gives you a lot of track layout options (the circle this set makes is pretty small). My son enjoys building and rebuilding the station pieces, but his favorite is laying out the track. I think the price I paid for this set and two track packs was perfect, and it's just enough pieces to keep track of them. He only likes to play with Thomas (even though this set does come with two trains), so I don't really need the extra trains and buildings, as it's just more clutter around the house!Overall, anyone with children who love trains should enjoy this set. Also, it teaches them about building, as even the trains need to put togther. We have the wooden Thomas table and train set, but he still likes this one and spends a lot of time playing with it, so I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you think the wooden set is enough. Kids can never have too many train sets!!!

While my son loves Scoop and Lofty and plays with them a ton, there is basically nothing else to this set, as the pieces you are left won't build much of anything. You can see on the box that you are only able to barely build the facade of a house with a window and two roof pieces, and a frame of a building. You at least get a caravan/little house with a door, windows, and stairs with the Travis set, my pick for the best of the series. Even the Muck set that comes with the recycling bins and chute offers more play value.With all the vehicles, you can't play heavy with them, as the pieces usually pop off. This set is very pricey, so I would only get it if your child has to have these two characters, becauase that's all you are paying for. It should have come with a little something better to build, especially for the price.

You get a decent size vehicle in Muck and you get two recycling containers and a chute to build, so the play value for the price is excellent. I think this is the second best set in the Bob line, after the Travis Caravan set.

This is the 2nd biggest set in the Duplo Bob the Builder series, but it seems to be the most pleasing playwise, as it comes with a building with opening windows and door, table and chairs, Bob, his cat, and Travis. It also comes with a trailer to put the house on, and it can be towed by Travis. While the Scoop and Lofty set has two vehicles in it, the buildings do not build up to much of anything, so you would just end up having more loose blocks around the house (that big set has 80+ pieces). I couldn't justify spending the extra money on it either. I recommend this one as the best in the series.My son loves these sets, but he also has the Thomas Duplos and tends to spend more time playing with those.

At the moment, this is the starter set in the series, although they show an even smaller Dizzy set in the catalog but it's not yet available. You get Benny, a fence, an orange cone, a window and building piece. There isn't much to build after putting Benny together, but you can't expect much for the price. Little Benny has the front loader and rear scoop, so your child should love playing with him. The other plus about Benny is that he is small and stout and out of all the Bob Duplo characters, he withstands heavier play without his pieces popping off. The one downside is he is the only one (although Dizzy will probably be the other if it's ever released) that is not able to fit the little Bob character inside. All the other sets come with the Bob figure but this one.

I picked this up recently expecting to maybe hear it as a little weaker, or dated, compared to all the new, fresh minimal techno that has arrived on the electronic scene in the past year or two, but what I found was a mix that can easily hold it's own with any '06 or even new '07 mix coming out right now. Ricardo peppers us with high energy techno and tech house from start to finish, with a lot of tracks, a lot of great melodies, and a ton of energy. It's much faster paced stuff than the minimal he is use to putting out lately, and you may be as suprised as I was to hear something this good, especially since rumour has it that he is a much better producer and creator of music than he is a mixer. What I love is that he is able to pack in a walloping 22 tracks, yet you don't feel cheated at the short length of some of them, due to the frantic pace of the BPM's in these tracks. This is a stark contrast to the long, drawn out 10-15 minute tracks he loves to create.A much better mix than his Green and Blue CD with Loco Dice from late 2005. Don't expect to hear an old dud from way back in '03 because this is as hot as anything out here right now.

In every way, shape, and form of moviemaking, Truffaut is the best. Best French director, best director, PERIOD! I wish Criterion would release all his films in bundled sets like this one.This set includes what I feel is one of his best films, Stolen Kisses, which along with Jules and Jim (which is getting a Criterion release) and Day for Night (now out of print), round out my 3 best Truffaut.Here is a breakdown of the Doinel movies in order of my preference:Stolen Kisses: A truly original gem of a film, which can stand alone from the other 2 adult Doinel movies the best. Funny, intimate, beautifully filmed and acted. The scene in which he repeats his name "Antoine Doinel" over and over again is my favorite. Wooing women and muddling through a young man's life has never been captured better.Bed and Board: Nice to see Doinel again, this time in a crisis over his marriage vs. a mistress. A nice view of this part of Doinel's life. Hard for Antoine to go through, but easy and fun for us to watch!Antoine and Collette: A brilliant short film on the frustrations of teen love.The 400 Blows: Original, daring, and brilliantly directed by Truffaut. It's just not as attention grabbing to me as his later stuff. A good start, but Truffaut was just warming up.Love on the Run: The least of this bunch, but by no means a bad film. Very nice to see all the characters in Doinel's life return. A nice way to end the series.This will be a must have for any Truffaut fan's collection, or any movie lover's for that matter!

Is Armin a Libra, because the scales seem to tip both ways for him? On one hand, he is an expert at mixing pure melodic trance and always has been; his live radio mixes are usually always chock full of the latest and greatest trance available. However, not since Boundaries of imagination has he ever been able to nail a trance mix on a released CD. All of his artist tracks and albums have been mediocre to only slightly above average, with nothing extraordinarily special. This CD is no different, with the exception of Shivers and Serenity, which I had heard both before and liked, so I was thinking this album was going to be good. Then seeing Justine Suissa and Gabriel & Dresden on there, I thought this definitely will be good. Oops, was I wrong.The CD is the 2nd hint of Armin changing his style over to a tecky sort of trance. He started this with the 2nd disc of State of Trance 2005, and in my opinion, failed miserably with a bad selection of awkward tracks. He now attempts to produce his own tracks, bringing in a more techno, high energy trance.The first track, with the now legendary Justine Suissa, isn't too likable upon first listen, but it gets catchier with repeated play. It's certainly nowhere near the best of Justine's work, but it's not bad either. Look for the Kyau vs. Albert remix of Oceanlab's Sirens of the Sea for a much better Suissa track. The 2nd track proves Armin is a master at handling the latest trance trends, which right now, is edgy, high energy, male vocal tracks. This one is a groovy, dance floor hit! The album version of Shivers is next, followed by the really bad male vocal track, Golddigger.His collaboration with the usually reliable Gabriel and Dresden results in a track that absolutely goes nowhere, and is and up and down ride through some really bad electronic melodies, nearly sounding like background music from a modern cowboy flick. Another Ray Wilson voiced track is next and Armin should have learned from his last subpar track with Ray, that this guy probably shouldn't be singing trance. He's not a bad singer, but he needs to sing pop or alternative music, and the lyrics in this track are just plain silly. The one plus side is that the music in the tracks is exceptionally good, just like Yet Another Day! These two would have been incredible as instrumentals. The downtempo track that follows is ok, but nothing special (hmmm, the trend here). Track 8 is a nice progressive trance instrumental, and tracks 9 is a bad one. Serenity is the last track and probably the top of the whole CD, as it's a ferocious slice of high NRG trance. The only thing is it should have stopped at the 8 minute mark, but instead the track goes on very, very slowly for an unnecessary 3 1/2 more minutes.So that's 2 exceptional tracks (Empty State, Serenity), 2 slightly above average tracks (Shivers, Bounce Back), 1 medicore track (Wall of Sound) and 5 underachievers. Sort of up and down, but a little too down. Unfortunately, I can't recommend purchasing this CD, as there are a plethora of better CD's released this year, which you can find in my other reviews.Armin needs to somehow churn out a mix CD that is true to what he does best: mixing the best trance out there. That is his strong point and he should stick with it. His artist albums are below average, his mix albums are up and down (State of Trance 2005 had an incredible 1st disc, but a bad 2nd one), but somehow, I know Armin is a damn good DJ and I still like to put him in my top 10 trance DJ's.If he is going to continue his attempt at breakbeat/techno/high NRG trance, I suggest he take notes from those who have already done it, and done it very well: Cosmic Gate, Voodoo & Serano, Kyau vs. Albert, and Marco V.

Surely, everyone knows how special these specials all were growing up, with the exception of Nestor, which certainly didn't get as much TV airing as the other two. And I needn't go too much into each one.The Year Without a Santa Claus has truly gained cult status, with it's quirky characters like the Heat Miser and Snow Miser. In Rudolph's Shiny New Year, everyone always loved watching Rudolph save the ultra cute Baby Happy (Baby New Year), and they always seemed to air it on TV the day after Christmas in the 70's and 80's. Nestor is a classic narrative of the Christmas Donkey with the long ears that is the least known and least replayed of the 3, but an excellent, heart warming, family tale.Now, let me get to the best part! The DVD quality is amazing! I think Nestor is the sharpest of the 3, with Nestor nearly looking 3-D like you can touch him on screen. You can see every hair fiber on the claymation figure! They really did an incredible job with the DVD transfers of these 3 classic Rankin/Bass specials.Don't even hesitate, this one has to be in everyone's holiday collection, and stop motion animation on DVD is visually stunning! All 3 for one price, it's a no brainer!

I actually purchased Luciano's Volume 2 of this series first, and then came back and found this one. They are both very different, as Luciano's is techno and minimal, and frequently devoid of melody, while this one is chock full of some very catchy house melodies. I must admit that after the first listen, I didn't enjoy it very much, as I don't usually listen to this type of house much lately. However, after the 2nd listen I was hooked by the superb mixing and the journey Ewan takes us through some simple yet very diverse sounds. There's just the right amount of electro to freshen up this standard deep house style. Vocals are prevalent, but are done cheese free and add just the right touch when needed. Not sure why this one got the title of Sci Fi Hi Fi, because there really isn't anything here to make it sound too spacey, barring a few electro jolts.Overall, I enjoyed every track and it's a solid house mix, all the way through. Lots of slightly varying styles, but all remaining true to the standard house genre. While the Luciano CD is much closer to the Sci Fi title, this one is a good by no matter what it's called.

Magnum, a name synonymous with upper echelon of documentary photography. Just a mention of the name brings instant thoughts of Capa, Parr, and Bresson. The most recognized name in the photo world brings their take on a very photographic country: Ireland.If you are looking for beautiful scenic and landscape shots of the Irish countryside, look elswehere. If you love reportage/documentary photography than this will instantly become a photo book favorite of yours, even if you do not have much interest in the country itself.What lies here is Magnum's best work from the past 5 decades, breaking each into it's own section. We get some brief text to start each decade, drawing a light timeline for us, and then it's on to the pictures.You would think the 50's would be mostly black and white shots, but think again. Along with some great shots by Henri Cartier-Bresson, we get some vibrant color images by Inge Morath. All the photos simply have one thing in common: capturing life in this country in all aspsects. Depicting people lounging, fighting, and dancing, and the objects, places, and buildings in which they dwell.You get over 30 of Magnum's top names, including Eve Arnold, Martin Parr, Steve McCurry, and Bruce Davidson, who lend photos covering both Ireland and Northern Ireland. I didn't recognize of a few of the Parr photos, and I have nearly all his books including Photographs of the West of Ireland, so I am assuming that some of these photos may be appearing in book form for the first time.It's a real treat for Magnum and documentary fans, and at the price I see right now on Amazon (way, way below list price) this is a must buy!

If this film were released in 1986, there would be those calling it a cult, 80's B-movie classic, with everyone trying to find a copy of the out of print VHS, or clamoring for it's DVD release. It's an out and out throwback to the SCTV/Hamburger: The Motion Picture/Revenge of the Nerds days of 80's comedy, and taken on that level, it works really well. It has your typical laugh out loud scenes, along with those that make you cringe and the "what the heck were they thinking" bits. The acting is spot on, considering the absurdity of the scenarios these medical interns get themselves into. Also, the cast spits out dialogue at a very swift pace, making it a watchable film throughout. Sure, lots of the jokes are duds, and they unnecessarily overplay some of the gore found in the medical field, but your side splitting laughs are a plenty and enough to leave you feeling entertained in the end.Definitely one to check out, if you miss all those crazy, sophomoric comedies of the 80's.

This game takes around an hour and a half to complete. It is VERY slow, boring, and any child under 7 will be bored to pieces after the first scenario of trying to get out of Charlie Brown's house. The narration is too long, you can't speed it up, and once you think you've solved the game and it's over, it continues on and on again.The only way I can recommend this is for young kids 3-5, who just want to see the Peanuts characters interact on screen and the opportunity to click on things and see what they do. Once you have finished the game once, it remembers this and you can now play any one of the game/puzzle sections of it again, but if you take it out of your hard drive completely, you will be back to square one. Other than that, it is very frustrating to play the entire thing.

I believe this is actually OM's second foray into the tech side of house, a big change from the funky and soulful house they are usually known for. The first was a mix called Electrolush, and it seemed forced how they tried to blend techno, tech house, electro and funky house into the same mix, and it didn't work at all. The discs were 3 tracks of one genre, 3 tracks of the next, and so on and so forth, to where it seemed like they just lined up the different tracks by genre, with no regard to the flow of the overall mix. Also, I didn't appreciate funky house in the same mix as techno; it just doesn't work.This, their second real foray out of their usual house groove, has both discs starting off with some standard house, and after 3 of 4 tracks of each mix, we quickly get some heavy doses of tech house the rest of the way. It's good track selections, good mixing, and great flowing sounds from both Justin Martin on disc 1 and Johnny Fiaso on disc 2. Fiasco does return to some house tracks near the end of his mix, so disc 1 has more of the tech tracks. They both sound great and after being burned by some previous OM releases in the past, I've finally found what I consider the best they've ever released, and a highly recommended 2 disc set.

It's easy to see how much these 7 guys really do love music, as the New Zealand collective known as Fat Freddy's Drop offer up a real diverse sounding album, filled with reggae and jazz infused downtempo vocal tracks. Joe Dukie, aka Dallas Tamaira has one of the smoothest sounding voices of any electronic or pop male vocalist I've heard in a while. His soulful and crisp sound instantly take any lyrical journey up a notch to the next level. It's DJ Fitchie doing the mixing, Fulla Flash on sax, Jetlag Johnson on guitars, Dobie Blaze on keys, Ho Pepa on trombone, and Tony Chang on cornet. These guys have no shortage in delivering jazzy soundscapes with a touch of dub and reggae to back Dukie.It's a different sounding album then most US music listeners would be accustomed to, as it's a far cry from the pop that's scattered across our top 40. However, in New Zealand, this album has been on their top 40 chart for an astonishing 90 weeks and counting, and was the biggest selling album in NZ in 2006. It's no wonder, as this is a quality album, by a unique musical collaboration. Mixing jazz, electronica, reggae, and soulful vocals, Fat Freddy's Drop have created a mind opening venture into current music trends.The album features the singles Flashback, a vocal track which sounds reminiscent of 60's Motown; Wandering Eye, probably the most mainstream sounding vocal track on the album; Roady, a playful dub track with some slick lyrics from guest Ladi 6; Ernie, a jazzy downtempo track with a full 4 minutes of soothing piano melody until the vocals finally kick in; and one of my favorites, Cay's Crays, which features the ultra catchy chorus line, "the skank be the rock in my life".Since this album has been out in other places before it hit the US, we can already seek out several versions and remixes of lots of these tracks. Especially notable is the Jazzanova's Mashed Bag mix of Flashback, where they remove the broken beat sound of the original, and turn it into a an even more vintage sounding vocal track, by infusing it with an all jazz sound. Cay's Crays also has a cool remix out there by One Self, which features two guest reggae vocalists and additional lyrics. A rare, live version of This Room can be found on Gilles Peterson's BBC Sessions compilation. It's exceptional, as they tend to make each track sound unique every time they play it elsewhere. You won't find them sounding the same twice, but you can count on every time sounding especially good, which further proves how diverse and musically talented these guys really are.A do not miss artist album that needs more exposure her in the US. It's better than the majority of the major artists and tracks now being played on US radio and popping up on our charts. If you are looking for a mix of exceptional vocals and nu jazz sounds, look no further. I can't wait for more from these New Zealand guys, and hopefully their stuff will reach these shores much quicker next time! One last note is that the store I shop at had this erroneously thrown into the pop/rock section, when it should be in either electronic, lounge, jazz, or even reggae. So, check around, order it here, or do whatever you have to to own this great album.

Well done tale of just about every monster in the horror genre made into clay animation (animagic). Not as enjoyable as most of the Rankin/Bass holiday animagic specials, but still quite a delight. It's pretty dark, similar to Nightmare Before Christmas, with some heads coming off and stuff. Not for the very young.The DVD is much better than the video released a few years ago. That video's colors were very dull and the DVD has livened things up. We need more Rankin Bass on DVD!!!

Nickelodeon's new smash hit the Backyardigans seems to appeal to all ages, from 2-year-olds to 11-year-olds, and even to adults. The colorful animation, catchy songs, and exciting adventures, make up one of the best animated shows currently on television. These 5 "kids" venture out into the backyard, only to end up on some incredible adventure, but they always manage to be back in the house for snacktime.You get 4 backyard adventures on this DVD, and the first two, are snow themed. They managed to conveniently release the first 2 Backyardigans DVD's of this show around Halloween and Christmas, but without having any one show set in the Halloween or Xmas theme. That's fine, as they will get some serious play, long after the holidays are over.The colorful characters look great against the snow backgrounds and just on visuals alone, should keep any kid glued to the set. Never mind the catchy tunes, including the Yeti stomp, which is my kids' favorite. There is only one thing on this DVD that might upset someone, and that is if your kid is an Austin fan. He seems to be MIA for 3 out of the 4 episodes. You are much better getting the first DVD of the Backyardigans if your child's favorite is Austin, as they won't see much of him here.Overall, a must have for the Backyardigans fan. If your child has never seen them, they will surely be hooked after one episode. If you are looking for the best DVD Xmas gift to get someone, this is it!

This movie borrows from just about every popular horror flick that has been etched in the mind of movie going gore hounds for years. Now, that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it draws out the best from all these movies, and rolls it all into one tightly knit, and very, very scary movie.Early on in the film we meet what could have been the most horrific killer in all of movie history. I say could have been, because while I don't want to give away the ending, there is a huge plot twist that dispells your entire view of the film. It is an unkempt, overweight sexual predator, who discards women like trash, and in his first scene, we see in truly horrific fashion how viscious he really is.As he lurks in the countryside, driving around in what looks like a model kit of a poorly designed tank, our two female characters decide to spend the weekend at one of their parents' homes. Then, night falls, and this insane of a killer decides to ring the front doorbell, and literally, all hell breaks loose.The title of this film couldn't be more spot on, as the tension in this film is second to none, and lasts for what seems like an eternity. Only 30 minutes into the movie, a series of abominations have already occurred and I sat there thinking how much more of this can I stand if there is still an hour left in the film.This is simply an in your face slasher flick of the brutalist kind, and the rest of the film deals with these two women attempting to break free from the clutches of the baddest killer in film history (or so it seems). Up until 10 minutes to go in the film, I was thinking that I had never seen such a slash fest before, and this had to be the best I had ever seen, that is, until the VERY unexpected plot twist.It took a while to swallow this twist, however I did and moved on, and still consider this to be one of the best 25 horror films of all time. However, had the film gone on with a "normal" ending, it would easily have been the best slasher film of all time, bar none.The Amazon editorial review really tears this one apart, however mainstream movie critics never like the Jason, Michael Myers, and Leatherface type films. But for all you gore hounds who do, this is one of the best, and if you can accept the ending, as I did, it still ranks as one of the best of all time. There hasn't been a film this terrifying in years.If you are faint of heart, get this R-rated version, because the gore scenes in the unrated edition are truly nasty, and may be very hard to swallow for many.

And so goes a Public Enemy rap song from the late 80's, as the ultra chic thief of the late 60's got immortalized on vinyl two decades later, and should continue to be an icon for decades more. The coolest burglar in TV or movie history is none other than Robert Wagner, as Alexander Mundy.Airing for 3 seasons from '68-'70, we got 66 episodes of espionage, heists, and of course, romance in exotic locales. We got a cool theme song from Dave Grusin, spun over psychadelic opening montages, featuring 3 different opening tags through the three seasons. In '68 you had Noah Bain, expertly played by Malachi Throne, uttering "Look, Al, I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal." In '69 and into '70 it was Wagner responding with "Let me get this straight, you WANT me to steal." And also in '70, there was none other than Alistair Mundy (Al's thief of a Dad) with "I've heard of stealing from the government BUT FOR the goverment!"When Malachi Throne departed during the '69 season, he was replaced by Ed Binns as Wally Powers, who was never as strict as Noah. Noah made Al stay in a government monitored house, under close wraps, but Al was quickly roaming free under Wally. While the 3rd season was a whole lot of fun, featuring Fred Astaire as Al's Dad, the shows never had as much pinache as some of the superb 1st and 2nd season hits, and one of my favorite shows in TV history was canceled far too early.What made this show so grande was the performance of Robert Wagner, and the premise of the shows, where Al was sent in (almost always under an alias and spying in various disguises) to steal something, spy on someone, or protect something. Who didn't want to emulate this globetrotting expert thief, who could steal things legally, sneak in and out of dangerous countries with the help of the US government, and seduce foreign diplomat's daughters.There were numerous classic episodes, often with lots of swinging 60's style and humor, but one very tense and dramatic story I remember was the two part Hans Across the Border, where Al had to smuggle a defector out of East Germany in a vehicle's hidden compartment. Great stuff, but the shows with biting humor were the best, like the one where Al posed as a Magician with an assistant, or the one when he was a photographer during a United Nations beauty contest, in the aptly named episode 38-23-36.There wasn't a show as fun as this one, a leading man as suave as Al Mundy, or a premise as sweet as this. It wasn't exactly a success at barely 3 seasons, but it should have gone on longer. Many shows have tried to capture the thief gone good scenario, and until recently with the excellentWhite Collar, we had gone many years where carbon copies of this show have failed.***DVD Quality update***: Wow, I can't believe it's been 6 years since I initially wrote this, pining for a DVD release. Now that it's finally out, many have complained of the picture quality. Well, after finally getting my boxed set, I can honestly review the DVDs. The clarity differs slightly with each episode you watch. In some, there is a ton of graininess, and in others, the picture is clearer but the sharpness is low. A few episodes have good picture quality and sharpness, however none are up to today's standards. If you are a picky about image quality and like to watch everything in HD, this will be a strong disappointment to you. However, if you are a fan of the show, and don't mind watching a lower quality picture, I don't think this becomes a deal breaker. It is similar to watching a VHS quality tape, and for some episodes, it's like watching a 2nd generation VHS copy. Hey, that's all we had back then and we still watched stuff, right? It's up to you whether you think the price and quality are worth paying for, but I am glad to own the entire series. It will stay in my collection and is still very watchable to me.Video Tip: Change your TV setting from "wide" to "normal" when viewing It Takes A Thief, as it will zoom out the picture to it's normal ratio, rather than enlarging and stretching it to fit your screen. This will give the episodes slightly better sharpness.

After nearly 2 months of this release being out in Germany, it is finally released in the US. The difference between the two is the bonus DVD. The German release had the Marrakech video and the trailer for the movie Mindhunters, which Marrackech is part of the soundtrack. The US gets and Ecstasy chill track and the video for Ecstasy, even though the making of the Marrakech video is part of the bonuses on the DVD, which is weird you don't get to see that video too. And lastly, after not understanding what was being said in German on my Kontor records Region 2 DVD, I finally get subtitles with this release.On to the album.1-Marrakech-An awesome first release off the album, with some really hot vocals from Tiff Lacey. 5/52-Ecstasy-Another Tiff Lacey voiced hit, that is great as a slower paced trance tune, and even better if you can find the import CD single which has some awesome club remixes. 5/53-The Autumn Leaves-A slower paced pop tune, which is rather well done and the vocals are sweet. 3/54-Here With Me-Tiff Lacey seems to get the 3 best vocal tracks on the album, and this may be my top choice of the three. 5/55-Black Nights-A chill pace with some great vocals from Madelin Zero. This one is quite catchy and Andre plays piano on this track!! 4/56-Mysterious Skies-ATB's best instrumental trance of his huge musical career. This track is incredible!!! 5,000/57-Collides With Beauty-This one is a dance hit waiting to happen. Great vocals and lyrics. 5/58-Sun Goes Down- A very cool chill track with male vocals (actually Roberta Carter Harrison's husband!). A very uplifting and catchy beat. 4/59- After The Flame-The familiar sounds of Roberta Carter Harrison are back and her collaborating with ATB on his album's is a given. Glad to have her back. I think Tiff did an excellent job with Marrackech and her voice makes it unique, but I think Roberta could have easily sung Ecstasy and Here with Me and had them sound just as good as Tiff. 4/510-IntenCity-Another awesome trance instrumental. Two whoppers of instrumentals on here make this album worth the price alone. 5/511-Eternal Swells-It's a mellow instrumental with some interesting bass sounds, but overall not too memorable. 2/512-Wait For Your Heart-Roberta Carter Harrison is back with a pop sounding chillout track. It's decent, but I'd rather hear her on slammin' dance tunes! 3/513-Circular Symetry-A nice uplifting, chillout instrumental to end the album. Some interesting guitar sounds meshed in, giving an ATB vintage feel reminiscent of his track "The Summer". Lay back on the beach with this one. 4/5And yes, I feel ATB is the best DJ on the planet, as no one has produced better tracks over the years. His talent for coming up with slammin' chart topping hits, and using the best female vocalists in the world are second to none.With this being ATB's 5th "artist" album with all original tracks, no other DJ, not even Tiesto or Sasha, has produced 5 solid albums. Tiesto and Sasha may be the best mixers and selectors of dance music, but there currently isn't a more prolific DJ/producer.ATB is #1

The Festival of Family Classics was Rankin/Bass's foray into cel animation of literary classics for television. They ran on ABC and were half hour shows. Nearly all of them have been released on various poor quality vhs tapes over the years. Others include Snow White, Jack O Lantern, A Christmas Tree, Puss-In-Boots (which appeared as a bonus on the 1st DVD release of Here Comes Peter Cottontail), Hiawatha, and Yankee Doodle.While other DVD distributors are choosing to alter vintage cartoons, by taking out original openings or editing theme songs, this one is completely original, with the opening teaser before each episode, and the narrated introduction and music still intact. The picture quality is excellent, and these specials look world's away from the old vhs tapes. There is still some slight artifacting present, but the images are very sharp.Both of the stories on this DVD happened to air as two parters back then, so we are getting a pretty long DVD here. The one hassle being that the DVD menu screen allows you to only choose one of the four episodes, with no option of playing all, or playing both parts of one of the stories. I also tried choosing part one of each story, and hoping it would just play into part 2, but no such luck, as it brings you right back to the menu screen. That's just nonsense!With this being labeled as Volume 1, it looks like we are going to get more! Maybe they will do a holiday one with Jack O Lantern and A Christmas Tree together, or a fairy tale one with Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White. Either way, it's great to see all the Rankin Bass specials getting their DVD due!

The songs, the excellent voice over characterizations, the clever animation, and fun characters, are what always made Rankin Bass specials a winner. This one is no exception. While the animation does appear dated, it does not distract from this story derived from the characters of the Rankin Bass TV show Tales of the Wizard of Oz, which consisted of over 100 5 minute animated shorts from 1961. It features the same characters from the show, but Dorothy and Toto look different. There's the Wicked Witch, Glinda, Dandy the Lion, Rusty the Tin Man, Socrates the straw man (scarecrow), the Wizard, and of course, Toto. The DVD has no special features, and it does not appear the animation was digitally cleaned up at all (some artifacting present).This is continuing in a current release line of vintage Rankin Bass releases, which started late last year with the two volumes of the animated 60's King Kong Show, and is continuing with two shows from the early 70's Festival of Family Classics: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in 80 Days, found on one DVD titled Festival of Family Classics Adventures Volume 1. Numbering that one volume 1, presumably means we are in for more. Keep 'em coming!

Even though this TTV/Leonardo Productions animated show is now 40 years old, things like how light bulbs and telephones work are still accurate and very educational for little ones. Being part of the disregard for violence era of cartoons, it remarkably has little gun play, violence, or fisticuffs (at least the episodes on this DVD). It has some very informative scenes where Tennessee and his pal Chumley get instruction and their education from Phineas J. Whoopee and his 3-D blackboard. Very fun for children of today to watch, and a highly recommended piece of cartoon nostalgia.

Amazon shows the picture of the 2 disc set, with the two sets of tracklistings on the back, but doesn't list it as the limited edition, or say it's 2 discs, so the initial release which came with the bonus disc may have sold through. I would make sure you seek out the limited with the second disc, or you are missing out on a full repoertoire of Trentemller tracks.The first disc is "The Album" and contains mostly tracks that stray from what we are used to from Trentemller: mindwarping minimal. I'd say there are 3 that fans will warm up to right away, Nightwalker, Chameleon, and Into the Trees (Serenetti Part 3), as these closely resemble the minimal vibes from his previous work. Into the Trees continuing the variant melody of what was Serenetti and Serenetti Part 2. What we do find here is a solid blend of abstract and ambient minimal, expertly crafted into smooth scapes of electronica, that really requires the listener to pay attention. It certainly takes more than one listen, as upon my first play of the album, I was a little less than impressed, but quickly hooked by the 2nd time around. There is a lot more emotion and beauty in these tracks, which isn't necessarily found in the casual listens you could escape with in his other work. His tech house monster riffs required no part on the listener's mind, to fully engulf that body shaking sound, however you have to forget all that and finely tune your senses to this album.Of course, this can all be chucked out the window with the second disc, as it's back to the churning tech house and minimal which made us all flock to Trentemller in the first place. It contains nearly all of his previous singles released on the Audiomatique and Poker Flat labels. Sadly, one of my favorites was left off, Minimal Fox. Still, this 11 track disc, amazingly doubles as a 'best of' and a back catalogue, as nearly all his tracks end up becoming high end representations of the genre. Add on two excellent vocal versions of two album tracks, and you have a perfect bonus disc from start to finish.The album itself is near perfect, except for the one track that annoyed me when it was first released, and much to my dismay, ended up on the album in the number 2 spot. It's called Vamp and was initially released on his Nam Nam E.P. along with Nam Nam and Killer Kat (both found on the second disc). It is a bass guitar chugging track that in my mind, goes nowhere. Barring that, from the epic first track which seems to just hit it's peak near the 7 minute mark, to the lullaby dreamscape of his final track, Miss You, it's apparent that we've just listened to a monumental electronic album by a Danish master of melodies. His new downtempo and ambient works require a little more warming up to, but once you're there, it's a blanket of music you just can't take off.

I couldn't help but thinking that the sounds radiating off these two CD's reminded me of some of the great GU releases of the past, which contained great progressive trance with a smidgen of melodic vocal trance. Ben Lost arranges what has to be the best Progressive trance mix in a long, long time, as the previous trance maestro's like Dave Seaman, Sasha, and Nick Warren, have all gone fully over to the progressive house side of dance music, and it's nice to see what the trance side of electronic music still has to offer.The tracklisting on here is like a "best of" current trance with some huge tracks like Critical 7's Lost, Miro's By Your Side, and Tilt's The World Doesn't Know. You also get Sonorous, U&K;, and Probspot, who all have had their tracks spun by all the best DJ's this year.Definitely a CD not to be missed. There are very few great 2 disc sets released anymore, and this is certainly one of them.

The second half of Deep Dish finally gets his turn in the solo spotlight, with GU's 31st release, and the second of the year (which already surpasses last years output and we're only in April). I mentioned in my review of GU29 that Dubfire would have his work cut out for him in topping Sharam's Dubai, and he certainly was up to the challenge, going the all encompassing route, and including just about every genre possible that can heat up dance floors around the world: house, electro, tech house, deep house, tribal house, acid house, minimal, techno, and even some trance. A very keen track selection by Dubfire.As I felt Sharam's best part of his set was the latter half of Disc 2, the strong point here is definitely the first half of Disc 1, with some luscious deep house melodies, and tracks 3-5 being a stellar sequence of tracks. I felt the flow tapered off in the middle, with a few tracks that brought the tempo way down, but thankfully picked right back up again. Dubfire stays on the more on the tech and electro side of house for disc 2, for a very steady flow of tracks, barring the MTV track, and ending with a Paul Kalkbrenner techno remix of Ellen Allien and Apparat's track Jet.If you are looking for a more standard house sound, check out Sharam's Dubai, and you won't be disappointed, however if you are looking for a mix incorporating all genres of the current house scene, you will reap the rewards with Dubfire's mix. You can't go wrong with either one, and if I had to choose, I would give the slight edge to Sharam, only because out of his two discs I only skip 1 track, and in this one, I skip 2.

It's amazing that you find an artist album by any artist in any genre these days, with you always finding at least 2-6 duds on an album of 10-15 tracks. Not so with my last two incredible purchases. One was the techno CD Home by Thomas Schumacher, and this incredible tech house and minmal stunner by German tech maestro Pascal Feos. He had a part in the 4 dj monster of a mix entitled Rave on Snow Vol. 14 which came out at the end of 2005 (a scorching hot tech house and minimal mix), and now he's got an artist album of all his own tracks, which are continuously mixed to keep a nice flowing going througout this 71 minute CD.He starts off with some slower paced minimal tracks for the first part of the CD, then eases into some very uptempo and exciting tech house the rest of the way through. There isn't a single bad track on here, and it really sounds like a DJ mix of various artist's tracks rather than all by one person, as they each are unique enough to not lose interest for the duration. Standouts include the title track, Synaptic, and the Robag Wruhme Remix of Tanzbombe, that was also one of my favorites off the Wighnomy Bros. Remikks Potpurri CD.If you are into some of the best tech house on offer, you can amazingly find it all from one person. His artist album is stronger than most mixes I've heard, with it's continous play, and it's one of the best CD's I've bought in '06. You also need to track down Thomas Schumacher's Home, as it's another continuous mix of techno and tech house, loaded with killer tracks throughout.

It's definitely not your run of the mill slasher fest, as it's got a weird horror and sci-fi mix, with an interesting premise, but it falls short all across the board as far as the meat and potatoes of a film are concerned.There apparently did not seem to be a running script, as for much of the film, especially the beginning, it sounded like every line was ad-libbed and improvised, with people barely getting there short and awkward lines out. There is little dialogue, and what there is, sounds like the actors are either unfamiliar with it, or are completely improvising as they go. The plot is basically these kids are at a carnival and get into a beef with some local hoods, then escape on a tiny boat, which sinks and they end up on a strange island, with a deserted hotel that is completely decorated for Xmas and a New Year's Eve party.The premise is interesting, but the plot isn't taken anywhere, and the movie completely stalls when the scenes shift to a sci-fi cause of all the casualties on the island. The special effects are very low budget, and not helping are the DVD transfer's colors looking rather washed out.There are a few stylish scenes which save this from being the worst horror film out there. The best is when one of the girls attempts to ride the elevator, and upon pushing one of the floor buttons, it turns to soft mush, and then these arms protrude out of the back of the elevator wall to grab her and suck her in. This scene was ultra cool and it looked like the low budget actually made it look realistic, with the arms bulging through what appears to be painted latex. The cracking paint as the arms swooped in actually made it look very real. Definitely the high point in the film, and one of the better scenes in any horror movie of this time frame.There's very little interest here, apart from a few scenes, and while it's not the worst of the genre, it's held down from rising above other horror flicks due to it's wooden acting and low budget. You might be interested in seeing it once, but nothing more. There are much better examples of stylish 70's and 80's horror out there.

Just some of the incredibly outrageous topics covered by arguably the funniest comedy in TV history (UK or US). Late one night back around 2002, I found this on a PBS station and couldn't recall laughing out loud like that in years. The side splitting antics of these 6 friends should be seen by anyone with a taste for humor, and an acceptance of risque subjects. Sex is definitely a major topic, as it is certainly a major part of the lives of twentysomethings living in London.We start the series with Steve breaking it off with Jane, only to hook up with Susan, which becomes a mainstay through the series. Patrick, Sally, and Jeff make up the rest of the sextet, with Richard Coyle as Jeff, being one of the all time great scene stealers in a comedic television show. His replacement in Series 4, while not a bad character or actor, simply cannot replace the talent that Coyle brought to the show. Enjoy him while you can, as he's only in it 'til season 3.Many of the plots involve misunderstandings, revelations, futile attempts at dating (mostly by Jeff), and hilarious conversations that take place when it's just the guys, or just the 3 girls together. It's an ingenious show, expertly created and written by the talented Steven Moffat, who is also responsible for some of the new Dr. Who stories on the BBC, and was a writer for the popular 80's British series Press Gang.You can compare it all you want to Friends, Seinfeld, and the like, but as it's own show, the storylines, dialogue, and interactions, among these 6 friends are truly unique, and incomparable to anything else on television.British humor (or any humor) at it's finest. I've guaranteed all my friends and anyone else who will listen, that if they buy it and don't find it to be one of the funniest shows they've ever seen, that I would buy it back from them. No one has sold me their copy yet! If you want to get someone a comedy DVD set for Xmas, I can't think of a better gift!

Dave's superb last mix, This is Audio Therapy, was a great mix of dark progressive house and breakbeat, and this is one is very different. As most of the progressive house world has infused some sort of Electro into their mixes these days, Dave is no exception, offering a great blend of light and funky progressive house sounds, with some buzzing and catchy new electro tracks.While I enjoyed this being a double disc mix, I think it would have bee benefited from beng tightened up to a single disc mix. Disc 1 is definitely the standout, with the exception of the Thievery Coporation track with David Byrne on vocals. Don't get me wrong, the guy is an icon of alternative pop, but his voice is not suited for dance music. My only other comment is that while the John Dahlback remix of Luke Dzierzek's Echo is a very good track in it's own right, the original is the BEST Electro track I have ever heard. As of this writing, I have not found the original on anyone's released CD mix, so he could have been the first, but he chose to use an inferior remix. Don't get fooled by the word inferior, because like I said, the Dahlback remix is good, but compared to the original, it doesn't even compare.Dave writes in the liner notes that the first CD was to chill at home to, and the 2nd was more geared to a dance floor, but I found more energy on disc 1. It ends with Dave's incredible 9 minute+ remix of Gabriel & Dresden's Tracking Treasure Down. This is puts the cap on an awesome disc 1.Disc 2 starts off great, with tracks 1-4, and you get a remix by Dzeirzek, and a track of his own. Then for nearly the entire middle tracks of this mix, you get some really boring and standard progressive house tracks. There is nothing exciting here, and I've tried to let this mix play a few times, but repeatedly kept hitting the skip track button. I really didn't stop until the last few tracks, and by that time, it really became apparent that this mix isn't up to par.I would still highly recommend this one, based on the strength of disc 1 alone. You get a few good tracks on disc 2, but not nearly enough as one would like. With Dave's first real foray into incoporating electro into his mixes, you can't expect it to be perfect, but what we have is still a very good listen.

As Rodney utters when Sheppard becomes smitten by the lovely guest star, Leonor Varela in the episode Sanctuary. This isn't just to poke fun at another Sci-Fi institution, as the writers must clearly see the similarities to that popular franchise. While the show is a spin-off of Stargate SG-1, it is vastly different, and in my opinion, much closer to a Star Trek series than a parallel to SG-1.The one main similarity the show maintains with SG-1 is that these are modern day, Earth citizens getting into these futuristic, sci-fi adventures. This aspect makes it very accesible to even the casual sci-fi viewer, as they can easily relate to the main characters, rather than have to rely to much on imagination and future machinations. Now, don't get me wrong, I love SG-1, but one aspect of the show that seems to weigh it down a bit are a lot of the military base scenes on Earth, with the dull board rooms and office scenery. Not that I mind non-action sequences, but I think the backgrounds are rather unappealing. There is nothing like that on Atlantis, as we have new "Ancient" scenery galore on this mystical cityscape.Out of the 20 episodes on this DVD, not one is a dud. I enjoyed every one, and while a few were somewhat boring, the performances and the building storyline of the season kept my interest rather well. The first real episode was a slower one, and almost got me thinking that nothing was going to be as good as the stunning pilot, but then I was hit with the incredible tension of the episode Thirty Eight Minutes. Sheppard and crew are stuck in the Stargate with half the Jumper in and half out, and Sheppard has a life sucking spider on his neck. This one was excellent.More good episodes abound, including the highlight of disc 2, Childhood's End. It's a storyline that's been played out in sci-fi dozens of times before (ritual suicide at a young age) but this one is done well, with particularly good performances by the guest actors. In the last episode on Disc 2, we meet the only other real enemy of the Atlanteans other than the Wraith, the Genii, led by a familiar face in sci fi: Colm Meaney. We get more of the Genii in season 1, including the two part story arc The Storm and the Eye, but Colm Meaney's character gives way to an equally talented villain, Robert Davi.Disc 4 has two great episodes in Before I Sleep and The Brotherhood. The former being a dual role for Torri Higginson, playing her older self, and she gives a powerful performance in the older role, almost better than the way she plays the normal Weir!! No, I like Dr. Weir, I just think she hates being talked out of her orders by Sheppard and comes off as bitter. In fact, the reason I gave Atlantis a try, was because I liked her performance as Weir in the Season 8 opener of SG-1. She was much better than the actress who played Weir at the end of SG-1's Season 7. We also get a neat, Indiana Jones, treasure hunt type episode in the form of Brotherhood, as they have to find where the 15 Brothers hid the ZPM using all sorts of clues and stones left behind, all the while with the dreaded Genii on their trail.We end the season with the build up of the dreaded Wraith heading to Atlantis, wanting to use it to gain access to the wormhole back to Earth. I like the Wraith as an villain race, and think they were used just about the right amount through the first season.Overall, I think season 1 was an excellent first season, and one of the best for any sci-fi show. While I haven't seen any of Season 2 yet, I have seen and read about a lot of changes including 2 new cast members, and the departing of Lt. Ford. I am not sure why this was done so early in the show, but tinkering with something that seemed so good, may be a mistake. Not many successful shows have a drastic change at the end of the first year. Most are consistent for the first few years: just look at SG-1, which went 5 seasons before the first main cast change.Back to the Star Trek similarities. Let's see, you have a macho leading man, who enjoys romancing alien priestesses (John/James T.), a stubborn doctor (McKay/McCoy), a Scottish crew member (Carson/Scotty), a non-Earthling lead crew member (Tayla/Spock), a solid action man (Ford/Sulu), and a setting that takes them to alien worlds (Atlantis/Enterprise). In Trek they traveled by ship, where here they travel by wormhole.Whatever the similarites to SG-1 or Star Trek, I enjoyed every bit of this new sci-fi show. The cast, storyline, and setting are all superb. There is lots of good sci-fi entertainment that can come out of this, let's hope it doesn't go downhill with season 2.One last note, there is absolutely no reason why there shouldn't be chapter stops throughout every episode. This is very annoying. I've bought half hour kids' DVD's that have a dozen chapters in them!

That is according to my daughter, who despite being a little older, says this is one of her favorites. It definitely looks and sounds the part, with the voiceover actors doing an excellent job with the leads; and I agree that the digital animation appears top notch, despite being a straight to DVD film (although I read that Disney briefly released it theatrically in LA to qualify for award nominations).

You get 5 brand new tracks, 1 remake or an old track, and 14 singles which ATB has released over the past 7 years. I don't know which two imports Amazon is selling right now, but I have the original German release on Kontor, which comes with a Bonus DVD that has all his videos right up to the two new singles from this album, Believe in Me and Humanity. You also get photos, interviews, and the making of one of the videos.Most of the videos were on his DVD he released in 2004, except Long Way Home, which you could only get on that CD single; Marrakech, which was on the import No Silence limited edition set; and Ecstasy, which was on the US No Silence. You won't get the DVD to play on your normal player, but maybe in your computer. If you are looking for a complete set of videos, and can play this PAL formatted DVD, this makes the set even more attractive. There's also an alternate version of the Believe in Me video.The first of the new singles is Believe in Me, sung by 4 Strings member Jan Loechel. It's a nice club/dance track, but I prefer the peppier versions on the CD single over the album version. The new Tiff Lacey voiced track, Humanity, is excellent, and while I haven't heard the remixes, the album version works just fine. It's a breakbeat/trance blend that Tiff sings her heart out on. Jan Leochel also sings an updated version of Let U Go, which I liked. It's a slower paced version that refreshes the song nicely.The 14 "best of" tracks are all his single releases, and they are all either radio edits or album versions. The radio edit of the new vocal remix of In Love With the DJ hasn't been on any other album, and the Here With Me radio edit was an internet exclusive, so even in the collection of past hits, there are some new perks.Over the past 7 years, no trance DJ/producer has been more prolific in releasing high quality vocal trance, instrumental trance, artist albums, and mix CD's than ATB. If you are a new fan, I would highly recommend this, just don't pass up some of is albums, thinking you are getting everything here, because you will miss out on a lot of great music (like one of my favorite instrumental trance tunes of all time -- Mysterious Skies off No Silence). Only his radio play releases are here. If you are a regular ATB fan, I am sure you are going to purchase this anyway!

After both Tiesto and Armin tried to incorporate some progressive house into their mix CD's last year, which I felt didn't quite work (although the all trance disc 1 of State of Trance 2005 was hot), both go back to 2 disc, all trance mixes in 2006. Here, Armin chooses the theme of On the Beach for CD 1, and At the Club for CD 2. Well, he couldn't have picked better titles, as they completely sum up what each mix is about.CD 1 started off a little sketchy, as I didn't feel tracks 1 and 2 were all that great, however, from track 3 on we get a flawless mix of high quality melodic trance. This disc never reaches ecstatic dance floor status, but that wasn't what it was intended to do. I think this mix takes a second listen to really kick in, due to it's slower pace. It's the perfect "background" trance CD to have on just about anywhere to listen to. Highlights include the Karen Overton vocal track Your Loving Arms, really juicy tracks 8 & 9, and one half of Way Out West (Jody Wisternoff) with a surprisingly good trance effort (he is usually house). The Jose Amnesia vs. Shawn Mitiska track My All is a hot track, and besides the Flashbrothers remix found here, I would also hunt down the even better Markus Schulz mix, which is a top 3 instrumental trance track for me right now. This entire CD seems to ever so slowly build up and put you in a mood, getting you ready of what's to come on Disc 2.Disc 2 heats up instantly with an opening track by Arksun (who is the male half of Luminary) and only slightly hits a snag with the awkard male vocals of Kyau vs. Albert's Walk Down. They had one of the best male vocal tracks last year in Made of Sun, however this one misses the mark. The mix hits a peak with a blazing hot track by M.I.K.E. and the CD never lets up with track after track of pulsating trance full of deep melodies. The track Venus by Stoneface & Terminal is another highlight until the CD finally comes to an end with an incredible new track by Armin Van Buuren himself, Sail. It's a sweet melodic number that's going to be big this year!Easily Armin's best mix in a while, and the best State of Trance mix out of these past 3. It's right up there with George Acosta's All Rights Reserved and ATB's DJ in the Mix 3 as tops in 2 disc trance mixes this year. Also recommended is Solarstone's Destinations and Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise 5. It seems everyone is going for two discs now, but you would be serviced well with Ronski Speed's 1 disc mix, Monster Series Volume 1: Live Germany, although it's a hard to find import not available here on US Amazon.Let's face it, there's heaploads of great trance and great mixes in '06, and this one is near the top! Oh, and in case you missed it, if you want an incredible mix experience by Armin, and one that defies description, check out his State of Trance Year Mix 2005, which is a best of the year mix with a whopping 82 tracks spread out over 2 discs! It's a hard to find import and track times are obviously short, ranging from 28 seconds to 3:14, but it's nuts!

Only 4 good tracks out of 12 on disc 1, and only 2 on disc 2. The rest are either mediocre at best, or horrible club trash. The Armand Van Helden track, Into Your Eyes is easily the worst song I have ever heard in the history of dance music. I cannot even believe how he thinks it sounds good for the singer to sing that hideous chorus over and over about 80 times in the song.As for the good tracks on disc 1, the first two are nice, with Reina's being the standout, and the last two are hot. The new DJ Sammy track on this disc is nothing special at all. It took him ages to finally come out with a new single and this is the best he can come up with?There are probably 8 tracks or so that you can also find on 2 other boring club mixes released lately, Ultra Weekend, and Dance Mix 7. They all seem to scrape from the bottom of the barrel, and you might as well only get one of them, because you will repeating so many songs if you pick a 2nd one out of the 3.The Cabin Crew remake of the 80's tune could have been good, had they not made the lyrics so repititious. Just because it worked for Eric Prydz doesn't mean you can take any catchy 80's track and just snip out the chorus and loop it over and over again.Disc 2 is boring as hell, with only the Yuhan track remixed by Johnny Vicious and the last Tiesto track being standouts. Yet another Pump up the Jam remake, and I cringed when I saw it in the tracklising, but it's actually decent and better than half the tracks on here.Not sure what's up with Johnny Vicious because his last mix CD was good and I saw him spin at a club last summer and he was great. He definitely didn't play this crap.

I have to say that after obtaining every Parr book I can get my hands on, I have been pleased with all of them and kept every one in my collection, except this one. I completely have no interest in people hurrying to France to stock up on booze because there is no tax. I feel it is his worst book, and apart from a few decent shots of people in line in a supermarket, there aren't any standout photos here. Definitely not his best work.

Wow, in a word was how I felt watching the first episode of the new Doctor Who's 3rd season. Smith & Jones that is (and not that the Runaway Bride wasn't great, as it was) which was the first pairing of Tennant and his new companion Martha Jones, played superbly by Freema Agyeman. The breakneck speed that threw me for a loop in Season One's opener Rose was back. Again, it offered a highly enjoyable and tightly scripted lead-in, to where the Doctor has to explain and open the eyes of a new Earth companion, to his many dimensions of both time and space.If you read my review of Season 2, I explained how I felt that with Series 1, there was simply nothing better on TV at that time, either a sci-fi or other genre show, but during Series 2, while still a very good watch and excellent season of Who, I couldn't safely say there was nothing better on televison. Well, now I am back to my original thought, that with Series 3, there isn't anything I'd rather be watching on television, and nothing more entertaining.I couldn't help but quickly make a comparison of Martha Jones to Mary Tamm's Romana in the original Who series, as someone of a high intellect and someone constantly keeping up to the Doctor in terms of wit, composure, and sophistication. While even though she is just a medical student, and not yet a Doctor when she's swept up into the Tardis, she's as sharp as a surgeon's blade in playing the part of a new Who companion. There were quite the shoes to fill with Rose's departure, and Freema has just about (but not fully) made me forget about Rose. Speaking of Rose, she is recollected in this series, through the Doctor's alouds, and it really sets the tone for a new Doctor-Companion relationship that we may have never seen before. Martha shares a kiss already with the Doc in the first episode, and is lying in bed with him in the second! Oh, Martha!Anyway, with the Daleks, the Master, and the Face of Boe, the surprises just keep coming in this season. It really rivals the first in terms of the best of the new Doctor Who, and after seeing all 3, unfortunately makes season 2 seem all the more weaker than 1 and 3. Again, I revert to my opinion that it's the writing that was at fault in series 2, and the scripts, dialogue, and character interaction weren't quite as enjoyable as what came before, and what has obviously come now. Some call 2 the sophomore slump, or as one Amazon.co.uk reveiwer put it, that "second album", where there was just something a little less in keeping it from receiving the gem status that I give 1 & 3.This is a must have season of Who. It also sees David Tennant really settling into his role and upping his status as one of the best of the Doctors. Amazingly, the weakest episodes in the series (if you can call any weak, as they are all quite entertaining) are the Daleks two parter and the series finale.I was a little sad to see that Martha is only returning for Series 4 in a more limited role, and that Catherine Tate was set to become a companion again (from the Runaway Bride Xmas episode). I liked Tate a lot in that one show, but I am not sure I want her as a continued regular, as she sort of gets on your nerves. We'll just have to wait and see, but Martha being relegated to a lesser role is definitely a minus in my opinion.As of this writing, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, video diaries, and the Doctor Who Confidential episodes are on slate as box set extras.

This is one of the few GU's from 1999-2002 that is not sounding dated. Play it today, and it will keep you groovin' to classic trance/prog. house selections.For some reason it's not available anymore new on Amazon, so some of the GU's may finally be going out of print. Get your copy now, as this one still has years of play life left in it.

The title says it all, as this is one adrenaline rush of a song. It's a super fast "hard house" style (read on) and very fast for trance, but Voodoo and Serano are known for their bursts of BPM energy on most of their tracks. The Club mix is definitely the standout, and it also appears on their Cold Blood, Coll. Edition CD. They have also just remixed it again, for 2005, calling it the Remake Mix, and it seems they took it up ANOTHER notch in the BPM department!Now about the hard house sound, this track is not original, as it is an enhanced variation on the 1996 hard house track Up To No Good by the Porn Kings. They took the vocals out and kept the thundering melody. Still a classic trance tune, as the hard house version had your typical borderline cheese vocals in it (actually sped up vocals from an old school Whodini rap song), that only appealed to fans of that genre.A classic of a tune that everyone shoud have. Just a mere mention of the title and it gets my blood pumpin. Stomp around to this one, just don't drive with it on, as you may find yourself at 100 mph in no time!

Ellen Allien, DJ, techno artist, producer, and founder of the BPitch Control record label out of Berlin, teams up with another German producer and artist, Apparat. Prior to Ochestra of Bubbles, Allien's last release Thrills produced some excellent tech house and minimal tracks, but also had too many stale spots for a 10 track album. It wasn't quite as good as her stunning album before that, Berlinette. Now this teaming with Apparat has brought together one of the best electronic artist albums I've ever heard.Right from the first two standout singles off the album, Turbo Dreams with it's pulsating beats and flowing horn, to Ellen's pop-like vocals on possibly the best track on here, Way Out, you know this is going to be something special. Track 3 was a little downgrade, with it's building strings sounding like a horror or war movie score, but tracks 4-10 were just incredible, eye-popping slices of techno that kept me spellbound through the start of each new track.The one track voiced by Apparat, Leave Me Alone, is the low point of the album, with some awkward sounding vocals meshed with a very cheesy pop like melody. Right after that is the one boring instrumental on the CD, Edison, a crackily minimal track which literally goes nowhere. The CD closes with an incredible breathy downtempo vocal track sung by breathy, German accented Ellen, which I could have taken a 10 minute dose of instead of the 4:58 time.I had sampled each track online because after Thrills, I thought it might be a case where I only wanted to download some of the tracks, but when I heard each of the tracks, they all sounded so good I just had to get the whole thing and I am glad I did, as I got 11 out of 13 solid electronic tracks.FYI: There's already two good remixes out there of Turbo Dreams, plus and elongated track of the album version, and an upcoming remix of Way Out by Robag Wruhme that I just heard of sample of and I'm dying to get my hands on!

Not only is this one of the best vocal and instrumental deep house mix collection I've ever owned, but it's also got a unique aspect that sets it apart. Disc 1 contains all the vocal house tracks, and with the exception of a few vocal snippets, Disc 2 is all instrumental. You would normally think this would not work, and that a few vocal, then a few instrumental breaking things up would be the best flow, however DJ's Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff have picked a stellar line-up of tracks for both discs, and each play very well on their own.Highlights on disc 1 include the soulful Bag U Should by Quizz Feat. Emilie Chick, and one of the hottest vocal tracks of the past year, The Cure & The Cause (Dennis Ferrer Remix) by Fish Go Deep feat. Tracey K. Some very sweet melodic tunes appear on disc 2, like Julien Jabre's gorgeous track Swimming Places and Kerri Chandler's So Let the Wind Come.A do not miss CD if you are looking for a perfect blend of vocal and instrumental deep house. Whether's it's one you prefer over the other, you'll have an easy time of picking which one, with them each having their own disc. Also, this is easily the best mix out of the 3 Cielo mixes by the same two DJ's (the other two are Cielo-Cloud 9 and Cielo-Seventh Heaven).

This is a song straight out of 1987, with a retro hip hop/Debbie Deb kind of feel. It's still very cool sounding and something with a twist rather than the usual fare that's out there now. The Extended Mix I feel is the best, as it's full of the tracks awesome retro flair, and keeps all the vocals where some of the other mixes do not.

Straight through, barring one cheesy vocal track, this is a non-stop aural assault of the most sinister and high energy tech house you are ever going to hear. This mix is full of special effects courtesy of their self titled "Decks and Effects" mixing style, with Ivan on turntables and Arnaud on a laptop. I must admit, when I first checked out this CD in my local shop when it first came out, and read the back where it says "always funky, this mix encapsulates the Paris disco underground" I opted not to buy it, thinking it would be too Parisian disco funk for my tastes. I finally decided to pick it up, after hearing a few of Black Strobe's latest tracks in other mixes, and thinking they sounded very techy.I have to say I am glad I ended up buying this, because it just blew me away. There aren't very many all tech house mixes out there, so this one is perfect. It has dark, fast beats, all the way through. I nearly slammed into a police cruiser taking a corner too fast, while listening to track 17. You have to use extreme caution when playing this one loud in your vehicle!!The only thing keeping it from being a completely perfect mix is track 6, which is a horrible pop or alternative sounding vocal track, that totally seems out of place. I had to check my CD player for a moment, thinking I had accidentally switched the CD off and went to radio, because it sounds that odd. Then I thought maybe the record company accidentally burned the wrong track 6 onto the Black Strobe CD!You also get a 24 minute DVD that shows you a quirky look at hidden spots in Paris you wouldn't see in other travel shows. At the end, Black Strobe talk a little about themselves and their history.This is an incredible adrenaline rush and a super hot tech house mix you simply can't pass up.

Unlike Disney, which has its trademark character, Mickey, there really isn't one Hanna Barbera character that you can slap the company name on. You have so many popular shows and characters, everyone is surely to have their favorite. From Fred Flinstone, to George Jetson, Yogi, Huck, Top Cat, and Scooby Doo, there are just too many to put on top as the clear fan favorite.One thing is for sure, one of the staple characters and my favorite is Yogi Bear and his beloved sidekick, Boo Boo. They are constantly getting in trouble with Ranger Smith, either for stealing picnic baskets, or trying to escape from Jellystone Park. Of course, many should be able to tell that the characterization of Yogi came from Ed Norton of the Honeymooners (while Fred Flinstone was Jackie Gleeson).First appearing in the Huckleberry Hound Show in 1959, Yogi was quickly stealing scenes, which led to his own show. There were not a ton of episodes, compared to the other HB shows, but it's simplistic characters and plots made it one of the most fun in all of Hanna Barbera land. The gimmick of him trying to leave Jellystone was used several times in the HB world: Magilla Gorilla trying to get out of the pet store, and Wally Gator and The Hair Bear Bunch always trying to escape the zoo.While these DVD's include the original early 60's shows, Yogi of course lived on in numerous specials and appearances over the years. He is still the mascot for Jellystone Campgrounds around the country. There has been heaploads of licensed Yogi memorabilia sold from around 1960 right up to the present day, and continues to be a solid find on any Hanna Barbera collector's lists.For the Hanna Barbera and/or Yogi lover, this collection of classics is a must. After already releasing Scooby-Doo, Top Cat, the Jetsons, Wacky Races, Penelope Pitstop, and The Flinstones, this edition was long overdue in my mind! Of the many zany quotes Yogi threw at the viewer every single episode, I will leave you with one of my favorites, as I pull a Snagglepuss and prepare to exit, stage left:"The deeper you go in the woods, the more nuts you find!" -- Yogi Bear

This one has 3 episodes, with the first being the classic early 80's Xmas Special, A Chipmunk Christmas. This is the one where Alvin gives up his prize harmonica to a sick boy for Christmas, then is in a bind because Dave booked them at Carnegie Hall and now he doesn't have it to play.The other 2 episodes are from the late 80's TV show, The Chipmunks. The first is named Merry Christmas Mr. Carroll, and I believe it is one in the same as the VHS release a while back called Alvin's Christmas Carol. It is excatly that, Alvin is being stingy and makes up a huge Christmas list, and then is taught the meaning of Christmas by 3 ghosts.The last episode, Dave's Wonderful Life, is in the spirit of Christmas and the story of It's A Wonderful Life, however there isn't really anthing festive or Christmasy depicted.A must have for the 2 Xmas episodes, escpecially the first one, where we get the classic holiday tune, The Chipmunk Song!

It may have well been called Back to the Lost World, or Lost World 2, as Disc 1 is a very solid, high energy offering not unlike his last mix CD. If you liked Lost World, don't even hesitate to pick this one up. What I especially found interesting was his choice of tracks that had a lot of breakdowns. After sinking down to an ambient like spot in the track, they would quickly pump back up into this high BPM mix. George has now consitently proven that his a master at picking some of the best trance out there.I really liked the shortened mix on disc 2, before getting to his own tracks, as some of the best trance is found here, including Riley & Durrant's Neon Eyes, and perhaps the best track on either mix, Martin Roth's Shockwaves. Actually, the only part of this 2 disc set that I wasn't too pleased with was George's own tracks. I liked the Blue Monday update, but all of the other tracks, with the exception of Trust, just didn't do it for me. They were ok, but nothing special. Getting back to Trust: after Can't Sleep by Above & Beyond, it's the 2nd best vocal trance track I've heard this year. It's features gorgeous vocals and an incredible melody!For barely a few dollars more than the price of a single disc mix, you are getting a full disc mix, another smaller mix on disc 2, and 5 tracks by Acosta, with 1 being a must have this year. All the way around, purchasing this one is an easy decision.

While the stories of these two 1/2 hour Christmas specials don't have anything to do with one another, they both feature similar looking cel animation from the classic team of Rankin/Bass. Frosty's Winter Wonderland and Twas the Night Before Christmas always seemed to air in the second half hour of a Christmas special hour block on network TV, but I wouldn't consider either one second rate.In Frosty's Winter Wonderland, the sequel to Frosty the Snowman, we find Frosty able to choose the exact likeness of his new snow bride (don't we WISH we could all do this in real life) as the kids make her to keep him company. This time, a magic hat won't work on her, only a special gift from Frosty. They attempt to get married, but not if the snickering Jack Frost has his way.The 2nd is the classic about a boy mouse who loses all faith in Santa Claus and decides to write him a nasty letter. After that, Santa decides to cancel Christmas and the town must fix their musical clock, which will belt out the classic holiday tune, Santa We Need You Today, if they want Santa back.Two great 70's specials from the kings of holiday television. I think these go well together, despite the fact that Frosty the Snowman should have come doubled up with Frosty's Winter Wonderland on DVD and NOT the inferior, non Rankin Bass, Frosty Returns. I think they have to do it that way, or no one would want to buy Frosty Returns on it's own!

This 98 minute taut action thriller is packed to the gills with suspsense and is just as fulfilling as if it were a 2 hour + action blockbuster, maybe even more. There is no filler here, as after only about 12 minutes, Jodie Foster is already on the plane and the gripping plot takes hold. It goes right up through to the very satisfying ending. All 90 minute films should be this tight from beginning to end.It's Hitchocockian in nature, then it delves into the psychological-thrillers-of-recent genre, and makes you wonder where the film is really going to go. I won't give it away, but if you are an action lover, this movie comes to it's completion pleasing just about any lover of thrill flicks. I agree, if you sit back and analyze what you've just seen, the plot starts to get very thin, but fortunately the movie's brisk pace makes you forget all about that, and only concentrate on the excitement at hand.Jodie Foster is superb, and supporting actors Sean Bean as the Pilot/Captain, and Peter Saarsgard as the Air Marshall lend a strong hand to this minimal cast. This also may be the best cinematography of any indoor type thriller, having about 95% of this take place inside this futuristic jumbo jet. The neo-machanized look of this plane makes you want to fly only in something like this in your future. The DVD quality is also about as clear as you can get.Highly recommended for action thriller fans.

This is a very diverse and explosive breakbeat mix. From soulful and reggae sounds, to rap, to disco, and even to a vocal track sounding very reminiscent of freestyle. Icey covers it all in an exciting and very energetic mix. Tracks 7 through 11 really heat up, with General Midi's breakbeat rap, and then onto Dj Icey's own new sexy track, Come Closer, complete with breathy female vocals. Even past track 11, right to the end of the mix, it's high energy, pounding beats. I can't recommend this one enough. It's a winner from top to bottom, without a dull track in sight. Also check out the Drumattic Twins new breaks mix CD, Finger Lickin Export 01.

My son loves his 3 figures from the Police Patrol line: Justin Time, Marshall Law, and Bill Barker & Buster. The only one he didn't want was the robot. It's nice to see a series without the major stars in it (how many Billy Blazes do you really need). They are all in blue themed uniforms, but vary enough to still look unique. Marshall Law must have had a licensing problem with the name, because now the figure has been repainted red and called Marshall Artz.Justin Time's shooting handcuff gun is probably the most fun accessory of any Rescue Heroes we have. The cuff closes around a wrist once it hits it, and my son loves to play chase with it.You can't go wrong with this figure for any Rescue Heroes fan.

An unmixed collection of progressive house tracks from DJ/producers from Greece. Dave Seaman couldn't have picked a better country to start his Across Borders series with, as Greece has some of the hottest DJ's lately, including their best export, G-Pal. All of these artists produced these tracks exclusively for this CD. I've seen one or two of them already pop up on other comps, but they are in remix form.G-Pal kicks things off with a haunting downtempo vocal track, featuring Anna Maria X. Dousk quickly picks things up on the next track with a stunner called Bummer. Tracks 3, 7, 8, and 10 are not quite up to par with the rest of the solid offerings on here. None of these 4 are bad, they are just rather uneven, with no catchy beats or melodies, and 2 of them border on being rather cheesy, simple-simon house. I was surprised by Kosmas Epsilon, because his past stuff was all solid.Tracks 4 and 5 are my two favs of the CD, with explosive Supermarket by Phatjak and the melodic Paramount by Christian Cambas. Tonedepth's offering is another downtempo track, with some great fluttering guitar sounds. A typical Tonedepth track for sure.Overall, one worth picking up as there are 6 great tracks to get here, all in unmixed form (although none of them are super long, and a few are under 5 minutes).Let me just add that I'm dying for G-Pal to release a CD because his radio mixes are currently the best progressive house sets I'm hearing by anyone!

Taking a look at the tracklisting before I purchased this, I saw a lot of great names and tracks. My other thought prior to purchasing was whether or not it is going to be really live, with crowd noise, or they just meant it was recorded during a live show, straight from Sasha's decks (or whatever he uses now or is calling it), with no computer editing afterward, and leaving out the crowd. I was hoping it was the latter, as crowd noise is always a slight distraction for me, because I feel electronic music needs to be heard in all it's pure digital glory, with no interuption.Well, what I found was 1) it is live, with lots of whistling and some annoying, uninterpretable chanting through a lot of the tracks, and even an equpment failure where the music stops suddenly on disc 2, track 1; and 2) despite the great looking tracklisting, the mixing just wasn't up to snuff. Now, I don't mean technical mixing, which Sasha has obviously proven he is a master of in the past, I mean track selections, times, and the entire flow of both discs. 15 of the 20 tracks are between 5:56 and 9:59, and only 2 are under 5 minutes. Most of these tracks go on way too long, and I really feel like I am listening to a CDR that I burned for myself, containing tracks in all their full lengths. It's almost lucky they have the crowd noise, because that's just the feeling you get, until the someone starts chanting and you realize it is a mix cd. While Sasha does do some live editing, it's nowhere as technical or involved as Involver or Fundacion. The tracks go on and on and it really gets to be a boring mix, on both CD's. That's not to say the tracks are boring, as if the same tracks WERE on a CDR I had burned, I would have no problem listening to them and not feeling bored. It's just when they are mixed, minimal and tech house need to be trimmed to fix the mix and continue the flow, rather than be heard from start to finish, which most of the tracks sound like they nearly are.While it's not a bad listen, with lots of great stuff, including Booka Shade's catchy minimal track Night Falls, the techy Roman Flugel Remix of Radio Slave's My Bleep, and the groovy tech house sounds of Monkeybreak by Nils Noa, it just doesn't cut it as a limited edition 2 disc mix. Check my listmania list of the best tech house, minimal, and techno mixes this year, you'll find much more enjoyable discs of tech.With John Digweed's Transitions tech house mix, and now Sasha here with a minimal and tech house mix, just about everyone has gone over to the tech side of house now. Hernan Cattaneo and Paolo Mojo have been the two biggest names I can think of this year who have stayed with a lot of standard house and progressive house in their mixes, although both have incorporated either electro or techno sounds in the mix.I just think Sasha needs to tighten up these tech tracks, into shorter durations, and it would have helped the flow a lot. Some of the tracks also didn't seem to flow well in their order, especially on disc 1. I think that the next artist in this new Instant Live series ought to think about leaving out the crowd noise. They should also put the tracklisting SOMEWHERE on the CD or sleeves, as the only listing is a sticker on the outer wrapper that you have to either cut out and put inside (which would probably get lost) or carefully try to peel the sticker off the wrapper and reapply it to the back of the CD cover. Even though they were quick to get this mix out (1 month after recording it live) it didn't seem like they were rushed and forgot about putting the tracklisting on there, especially since they took the time to print on one of the inner CD sleeves that you need to go to a website to print out the trackslisting, and then slip it inside your CD case. That is pretty lame.

By Commercial, I mean a megamix put out by a record company with no real star DJ to advertise. You know, you've seen all those Pure Trance, and This is Trance, and Trance this and Trance that CD's everywhere. Well, this one sets the standard on what they all should sound like.Superb track selection, lots of long versions of each song, and a well-mixed cd.If you are going to by one "commercial cheese" trance CD, make it this one and you're done. Come on, you've got 2 Tiesto remixes, an Armin Van Buuren track (as Perpetuous Dreamer), Kosheen, Moby, and Oceanlab. What more could you want!

Robert Polidori has captured in large format, cities which have now become ghost towns, due to the most devastating of nuclear accidents. The colors are muted in the photographs as they are in real life, with everything that's left covered in dirt, debris, and rubble. There may never be a full clean-up because of the radiation still present, which would put people at risk, and the fact that it will never be rebuilt anyway. It appears most of the shots were taken during cloudy days, and I am wondering if the mood would have been emphasized a tad further had some warmer light shined into the interiors.The story of what happened is barely touched upon, but this book is a photo representation of what is left behind, and not a story about what happened. I have no problem looking elsewhere to find the history of the accident, and think the book stands alone as a stunning pictorial depiction of what can go wrong in the nuclear age. One of my favorite photo books in any genre.

James Holden's entry in the Balance series, utilizes a direct translation of the title of this series: he expertly blends a melodic mixture of both trance and house for the progressive fan. Without sounding to extreme in either direction, he manages to keep both types of listener glued to the mix. Never sounding too housey or trancey, the ecclectic tracks play like a balancing act, without ever falling too far into one spectrum.A few quirky vocal tracks thrown in in just the right spots, but the rest being groovy, melodic electronic music which either dance connoisseur can eat up.

This tech house and minimal artist album plays like a full mix, as Guido mixes all his recent past and new tracks, along with his remix works, into one mix CD. It seems to be the way to go, as Pascal Feos and Thomas Schumacher have also continuously mixed their artist album's this year.With Guido's quality repertoire of minimal tracks, it makes for one great mix, and while it may not be as exciting as the two other artist album's I just mentioned, it's a solid release for 2006 and any minimal fan can't go wrong with this one.

I guess I was extremely spoiled by Season 1 (see my review there), waiting all those years to find that once the show had returned, it was back with a spine tingling, take your breath away with excitement, jump out of your seat in disbelief of such glorious scripts and performances, absolute freaking vengeance. Now, onto series 2, I was in no doubt looking and expecting nearly the same, albeit with a different actor at the helm. This was nothing different for Who fans, and with some slim exceptions, it all worked out well.I know some of you say we can't compare this and series one, or this and that, but hey, it's what Who fans have been doing throughout time. I firmly believed that as an entire season, last seasons series 1 of the new show ranked up there as possibly the best full run of episodes in Who's full run. Having to follow that would be a true test indeed, and while I thought season 2 was very enjoyable, it wasn't quite as strong as 1.There was evidence even in the promising first episode, The Christmas Invasion, that there was some little je ne sais quoi that I couldn't quite put a finger on, that made is ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1's shows. There was further evidence when it came to season 2's first real episode, New Earth, as it muddled along without a whole lot of excitement to take in.Thankfully, after the very good reunion of The Doctor, Sarah Jane, & K9, the show seemed to keep creeping up and up in excitement quality, until the brilliant season finale two parter. In fact, this two part mind blowing season finish, was probably the first time I had felt as ecstatic as I did watching the entire first series episodes.I was displeased that the second season never felt as unique as series 1, but nonetheless still had fun watching yet another strong run of episodes in Who's continuing history. After thinking about it more and more, I came to the realization that it was less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that made the two series different, and more about the strong writing of series 1 compared to the medoicre scripts of season 2. Season 1 just had more snappy dialogue for the doctor, more impactful events tightly woven into the 50 minute episodes, and overall better stories.That's not to say this season didn't have it's share of goodies, including one of my favorites, Idiot's Lantern, dealing with supernatural events in the 1950's, and leading into the very spooky two parter, The Impossible Planet, and the Satan Pit. It's just I couldn't help but think when I watched season 1, that this was hands down the best show on TV, the best sci-fi episodes on TV, and the best Who in a long time. With season 2, I can't safely say that I enjoyed it better than say a season of The Dead Zone, Stargate, or Stargate Atlantis, but I can say it's a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the Who Universe. I just wish the scripts were tighter and flowed better.On to David Tennant. It took me a few episodes, for me to take a liking to him, but quickly found that he is just as quirky a Doc as any predecessor and deserves his worthy place among the rest. He can bring his serious side out just as quickly and believable as his distinct, flamboyant one. I think having him a second season will be a welcome event, after having Eccleston for one short one. Hopefully, they will get the writing a little more up to snuff, and the excitement level, so I can once again, safely say there is nothing better on TV than Who. For right now, I can't, but it's still an excellent season of Who, a smooth transition into a new Doctor, and left at a point where this new, yet old, franchise can continue to grow. Here's looking toward season 3 ...

Tons of stuff come in this set, for a super price: a Thomas, cargo train with cargo piece, a tree, a Sir Topham Hat figure, two signs, a 3 section bridge, a water tower, and tracks that form a figure 8.If you add up the price of the red water tower, one train with attached cargo train, a bridge, and several track sets and accessories, you would be at a price 50-75% more than the cost of this excellent Thomas starter set. This set is even worth it if you already have other pieces in the line. My son wanted a water tower, and I figured why pay the price of a single one, when for a few dollars more, you get 2 trains, a bridge, signs, a figure, a tree, and tons of track. While some of the larger Thomas sets don't really save you cash and can be very pricey, this one is probably the best value out there.One other note, the differences between the red and yellow tower are not just the color. The red one, sold by itself, has the train track piece attached to it as one unit. The yellow one in this set does not have a track attached, but comes with two little magnets in front, and there is one straight track piece that has the two magnets on the side, so you can make it stay put. It may take a few minutes when you disassemble it, to find the right track piece with the magnet, and if you have a lot of track like we do, it can take several minutes!! In a way, it's better than the red one, in that you can place it where you want, even around a curve, by just using it alone. On the downside, if you lose that magnetic piece of track, you won't get it to attach to anything anymore.

While the film could have been an interesting big screen adaptation of the Casanova tale, with lots of young and up and coming actors and actresses, it falls into the trap of looking like modern day actors forced into these medieval roles. They just don't pull off looking like they should be in that time frame. Many, many comedic attempts have tried to go the bawdy romp route and failed, and this one is no different.For a much better movie, and similar theme, look no further than television and the British production (shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater) ofCasanova (Masterpiece Theater). It's a tremendously better play on the same plot, and you can see the production quality and performances are all a notch or two above this sophmoric, direct to DVD flick.

A juicy collection of melodies from top to bottom, starting off with the spacey Io by Matt John right through to the final pops and clicks of Plunder by Alex Smoke. All of these are prime examples of the minimal genre and this upbeat mix plays through at a very satisfying pace. You'd be hard pressed to find as fine flowing a minimal or tech house mix. One of the best in the long line of Fabric mixes. It's a mix that's continually in my player this year, without ever losing it's excitement. A must own for the minimal and tech fan.

Characters run too fast through choppy scenes, and it seems like the shock value of some of their excess behavior outweighs any real story value or entertainment. When it was over, there really wasn't one standout character or performance. A forgettable film for me.

Veteran DJ/Producer Francois K releases an epic 2 disc set that mixes tech house, techno, and a little minimal and deep house. The 17 track first disc is mostly all tech house, with a few minmal tracks, and is loaded with solid tracks from the most popular artists in tech right now: Trentemller, Ame, Alex Under, Nathan Fake.What is incredible to me about disc 1 is his ability to fit 17 tracks onto one disc, and yet none of them feel short of feel like they've been trimmed to only 3-4 minutes. He occasionally lets a track play for over 6 minutes, but on the shorter ones, he always seems to use the meaty mid section of most tracks, eliminating the first and last minute or two, to only bring on the heavy, melody laden centers. What we are left with is tracks that seemingly sound longer than they are, as the main beats and melody loop for what seems like a full 5-6 minute track. In fact, I got to track 9 in the mix and couldn't believe that I was only a little more than halfway through, as it seems like the disc had been playing for well over an hour. This skill at using the juicy part of each track translates into this sounding like one epic journey!FK slips in a storming techno track of his own to close the disc, and gives you a preview of what's to come on Disc 2. The first 3 tracks of disc 2 are some thundering techno, and we slow down to some slighly less energetic, but no less stunning techno for tracks 4-7. Keen ears will recall the spacey sounds of track 4, Sleeparchive's Elephant Island, appearing as elements in Richie Hawtin's DE9:Transitions mix. Track 8 starts off what I feel is the only weak portion of this 2 disc mix, and that's where FK delivers some standard, deep house tracks, which I don't feel work very well in this mix. They sound ok, but I would have preferred the sounds to remain at a techno/tech house level and not get too housey. The piano laden melody of Angello and Ingrosso 's 82-83 definitely sounds out of place. After that, things quickly get more techy and we close this disc with a little of everything: techno, minimal, and tech house. The always reliable Gabriel Ananda, and Dave Ellesmere's Isolated Blue Cube are definitely favorites of mine off this disc.Even with the somewhat out of place house portion of the middle of disc 2, this mix has too many scorching elements to give it any less than 5 stars. It's one of the most exciting tech mixes of the year.

It seems Misstress Barbara has gone tech house, leaving her techno days behind her. All the better for me, as I took one look at the tracks on here and knew I wanted to buy this, even though I wasn't a Barbara fan. As soon as the pounding bass dropped in the first track, and then a sweet bassline, I thought I was going to be in for a great ride, until a horrible guy interrupted and starts saying "this is too hot" over and over and over again in the most dismal and cheesiest of voices, totally destroying an otherwise great track. It left me wondering what the heck was going to come next, but thankfully, the rest of the tracks are hot.The one odd thing about this mix is that usually a DJ would drop the minimal, downtempo, and ambient stuff first, then build up to the higher BPM and high energy stuff. M.Barbara hauls out all the hard hitting tech house tracks first, then after she breaks out a 1992 acid house classic by Lemon 8, she gets into some downtempo house and minimal the rest of the way. It's a solid mix worth of tracks, but I would have preferred the normal way of building up the BPM's.A few of the track transitions sounded awkward, and I'm leaning toward her choice in what track follows the next rather than bad mixing ability. I think a few of the tracks just did not sound right leading into each other. Nothing more evidenced by the stunning track Beta Boy by Trentemoller, which the original is over 7 minutes long, but she regretfully cuts it after letting only about 3 1/2 minutes of it play, and the next track literally swallows it up when it kicks in, making me cringe a little when I first heard it.With this type of house, you always need a few listens, but it really grows on you and there is some good stuff on here. Overall, a great pick up for the tech house fan.

As it states across the top that it is the complete eighth season, they have finally added the unedited Threads episode! With no mention of it on the outer box, I wonder if they are downplaying it and don't want to admit the previous blunder.Anyway, this season was a very solid year for SG-1, and with the exception of the real dud, Avatar, where Teal'c gets stuck in a virtual reality device (oh, my, how many times have we had this storyline beaten to death in the sci-fi world), I enjoyed every episode. We had a healthy dose of humor injected episodes: Affinity, Prometheus Unbound, Zero Hour, and Citizen Joe. We had some team altering dramatics, including yet another death to an SG member. We had the return of old enemies (Anubis) and some new ones (the replicator Carter). And we also got an incredible finish of 5 startling epsidodes to end the season.I think that the high quality of the scripts and dramatic episodes helped take your mind of the loss of screen time for Richard Dean Anderson. His moments in the series though, were key, and his presence was well known. Even with less lines, he always managed to throw in his dry wit, especially to Baal in the Reckoning two parter.The series just keeps proving that it's high quality sci-fi, and well worth owning on DVD with the rest of the series. These new slimline cases are nice, but if you already have the chunkier ones, I see no need to buy these again, unless you are after the longer version of Threads in this Season 8 set.

While watching the shortened one, you definitely get the sense that you are missing some key elements of the story, and it ends too soon. I am not sure whose bright idea it was to shorten it.I think that the high quality of the scripts and dramatic episodes helped take your mind of the loss of screen time for Richard Dean Anderson.

Miami's George Acosta is one of the most solid trance DJ's of the past 5 years, and his latest release surely keeps his place firmly at the top of the trance maestro list. He is known for spinning melodic trance, and always mixing in classy vocal stuff as well. This one retains all that and then boosts the BPM's and energy to a near explosive level (especially with Kompressor's Black Onyx).The thumpin trance never dies down and only the horrible vocals on track 9 keep this from being a perfect mix from top to bottom. George features all the top German trance artists of right now: Mirco De Govia, Ronski Speed, Woody Van Eyden, Alex M.O.R.P.H., so even being from the devoid-of-trance-stars USofA, George always knows where the top trance is coming from.A few things I'd like to be picky about are the fact that possibly the best track on here, Woody Van Eyden's SI-N+R-GE, is cut to only about 3:30, and Acosta's own new effort featuring John Secada, is a very short mix at just over 4:00, and the CD ends with it fading out way too early. I would have wanted a longer mix of this great new track.*Update* I had a flawed CD that skipped in a few spots on the last track and I exchanged it twice, and on all 3 CD's the flaws were in the exact same spot, so unfortunately, it's on the master. These are not really skips, more like little "diggers" in the music. There is one in track 10, and the rest are in the last track, with the biggest one (the music cuts out for 1/2 a second) coming at 2:58 into the track. Also, I noticed you have to turn the treble down a few notches when listening to this, as it appears to have been recorded with it up at a rather high level.All in all, this one needs to be on every trance fan's short list for 2005.

WOW, is about all I can say, as I wasn't expeccting such an incredible mix by Emerson, and was even hesitant to buy this, especially considering the steep price compared to other 2 disc mixes. The theme here is a dark progressive style that I love, and nothing like his usual club and true house sounds. He really gets down and dirty here, and the first track, Hard4slow, a scorching hot vocal track by Emerson, sets up what is easily one of the top 10 progressive mixes of the year (and there are lots of good ones this year). This is one of my top tracks of the year!He delves slightly into some lighter house, but the dark and stunning electro beats are never far behind and there really isn't one bad track on this entire disc. All 4 of Emerson's own tracks on here are superb, and a clear indication that his soon to be released artist album is going to be hot!The bad news is, Sharam Jey's disc is a real tripped out house funk that I just can't grasp. It is a big contrast to Emerson's hot progressive sounds. There are a few decent tracks, but overall, a way too funky house mix with some very eclectic sounds and melodies that just don't move me.I think it's still worth the bucks to here Emerson's great electro and dark progressive blend. Don't miss it! I can't wait for the artist album!Two last notes: I don't know why Amazon has the artist incorrectly listed here as F5. I have contacted them about it and hopefully they correct it soon, because fans really need to find this album. And track 12 on disc 1 had a slight skip. I am going to try exchanging it and hopefully it was just this disc, if not, it's on the master.

Kyau vs. Albert have a very unique trance style, as they can create some superb and very different sounding instrumental and vocal trance. Just listen to the many different styles found on here, from the female trance hit Not With You, to the resounding anthem Velvet Morning, to the male vocal stunner Made of Sun, to the very ecclectic instrumental Clarissa.One noticeable variation on their vocal stuff is Albert does some of the vocals and he has a very "weird", nasal sounding voice. It can sound decent at times, but on the other hand can be a little off-putting. Save Me and Made of Sun sound really good as male vocal trance, however the vocals in Velvet Morning and Tell Me can get rather annoying. You kind of have to hear the tracks and his voice to see what I mean.Now they can also bring in some great female vocalists like Damae (who sings a duo with Albert on the extremely rare original Velvet Morning that is not on this CD) and Julie, who sings the amazing vocal trance track, Not With You. The album version is great, but Ronski Speed's Vocal Mix is the clear winner, and it's one of my top 5 vocal trance tracks of the past year.This album actually was originally released in Germany (on the Euphonic label) at least 6 months ago with a different bonus CD that contained two videos (one for Clarissa and one for Not With You) and the awesome Kyau vs. Albert Remix of AVB's Burned With Desire. Other than Burned With Desire and the videos, you get all the other tracks on the import bonus CD plus a few more bonus remixes only on the US version. You get the incredible KvA mix of Jump the Next Train by Young Parisians feat. Ben Lost. You also have to seek out the Probspot mix (found on Ben Lost's mix CD) and the best of the 3, Solar Stone remix, to get the trifecta of one of the best male vocal trance tracks of all time.Kyau vs. Albert are working very hard on their own and on the remix side of some of the best trance currently out there. Their hard work shows in this above average artist album, which is basically a career's worth of their solo stuff right up to their current singles Falling Everywhere and Made of Sun.Definitely a must have trance album for '05. You also should get their Positive Ways 4 mix CD which is out end of February, and includes some of the newest, hottest trance around!

I think they should have opted for a color photo on the slipcover, as the black and white scene they used gives no indication of the stunning use of color photography found inside this book. It is loaded with stills taken from the production of all of Truffaut's films, and is packed with pics I've never seen before.There have been lots of books on Truffaut over the years, and most of them covering his personal life, and in depth anlaysis of all his films, but this is the first I've seen to focus strictly on what it took for Truffaut to get each of his film's made. It certainly isn't a photo book, as there's tons of text accounting the many facets of a man who loved his craft. Everything from how certain actors came to get parts in his film, to how Truffaut would invent scenes in his films, right in the middle of production.I certainly haven't read it all yet, but what I have I found very intriguing, and between the in depth stories behind the films, and the great pictorial history, this book is certainly a keeper.

Not since the Plump DJ's Fabriclive 8, way back in early '03 has there been as an exciting breakbeat mix for the Fabriclive series. The Meat Katie and Freestylers mixes were decent, and more recently, Evil Nine and the Stanton Warriors, which I felt both missed the mark. Up pops Tayo, master of Dubstyle breaks and Baile Funk, with an exciting 27 track mix that's easily my pick for the most energetic CD to pump up loud this summer. Tayo crosses from your normal breaks, to grime, and over to dub, but the main theme always constant is his choice of the heaviest hitting, high impact breaks. The flow is sensational, and this mix can literally be just kept on repeat throughout your day, without it ever losing it's edge or energy level. Slick rap lyrics and hard hitting, reggae tinged breaks make up 27 fast and furious tracks at a never a dull moment pace, making this one of the best Fabrics ever, and not just in the breaks category.A phenomenal ride by one of the most exciting DJ's in the UK.

While you can certainly group this into the large spectrum known as progressive house, there are only a few real progressive tracks on here, and some tech house, but the rest is simply the best pure house music currently on offer. There isn't a single house CD that is going to move you as much as this one. Full of funky, infectious beats, with basslines and disco melodies to keep any dance floor in a frenzy.There really is only one negative to both CD's: I wanted them to go on longer than the amount of music able to fit onto one CD. At the end of each disc, you are left drooling for more, and do not want these beats to ever stop. Apart from 3 weaker tracks in the middle of disc 1 (tracks 4-6 to be exact), both are superb. Disc 2 is the real stunner, without a dull track in sight, but both discs feature some monster tracks!Disc 1 starts off progressive with Will Saul's Mbira and the first 3 tracks are solid. It gets a little weak with some rather dull disco tracks from 4-6, and I didn't care for the vocals in track 5 at all. The rest of the disc really gets moving with some pure house sounds, and climaxes with the incredible track, Our Lips are Sealed by The Visitor. You get a hot new update of Soulsearchers Can't Get Enough by Derek Howell, and the BPM's really pick up at the end of this mix, giving you a taste of what's coming on disc 2. The last track, Piano Tool, of course features some piano in it, and this track and all the other disco sounding stuff on here are great, with the exception of those few tracks I mentioned. I usually am picky about disco sounding house, but I can assure you, that it's not the cheesy kind on here, and just wait 'til you hear what you get on disc 2!After the downtempo sounds gradually got faster and faster throughout disc 1, culminating in some high energy dance floor house which left you begging for more, Desyn chooses to slow things down for the start of disc 2, with the now classic ambient track, Halcyon+On+On. The pace quickly picks back up with some sweaty house tracks, and the music is at a solid dance floor pace throughout.Once we get to track 9, prepare yourself for a dose of the hottest combination of tracks you will hear on any dance CD this year. It starts with the groovy Time for Change and kicks into a scorching Raul Rincon remix of Coburn's We Interrupt this Program. The original version had a decent melody and has been a DJ staple as of late, but prepare for the track to hit a new high with this remix. Then Desyn drops the bomb of a track Make a Move on Me, and I don't care who you are, where you are, or how you feel at that moment, but when this track hits, it's guaranteed to make anyone move. I can't even imagine the frenzy at a club after hearing these 3 tracks in row. Desyn certainly knows how to move a crowd! It seems like he set you up the entire mix just to blow it up right here!The last 3 tracks get into some nice tech sounds, and at the end, I was left feeling this needed to be a 3 disc or 4 disc set, because I just couldn't get enough. This is simply the best pure house mix right now, and one you cannot miss!

The song gets 3 stars, and for adding Punk from the live at Spundae mix (the best track on that CD), it gets another. It's a pretty decent techno robotic vocal song. Not that big a fan of robo-vocals, but this one plays out fine. One note to the other reviewer, the vocals are &quot;let's ROCK, I wanna Rock your body Rock&quot;... and no, it is not the f-word as much as you'd like it to be.

Having shopped with my son for Rescue Heroes for a while now, every store we go in seems to have tons of the very boring Lava Squad series lying around. They are still there after Xmas. The figures all look the same, with the same orange color scheme, and this character, Val Cano, doesn't even look human with the non-removable helmet. My son has to have every new human character we find when we visit a toy shop, but he won't touch the robots. When he saw Val Cano, he quickly threw him back on the shelf, not interested in the least, as he thought he was a robot.The Rescue Heroes line has been pretty prolific now (since the late 90's) but I think this is the worst line to date. They could have had an orange theme, but added different looks to each character, and they definitely should have given Val Cano a helmet that comes off so we know there is a human in there!

Two of these stories, Mickey's Christmas Carol, and Pluto's Christmas Tree were featured in the Mickey In Color tin Volume 2. The only new one was Small One, which I had in VHS form for many years, and always thought it was a Disney short classic, so I decided to purchase this set. Unforutnately, the colors on the DVD version are no where near as vivid as my old video copy. There is tons of artifacting through all 3 shorts, but at least the other 2 are very colorful and vibrant.It is still a recommended collection, as the two Christmas shorts featured in the Mickey tin had to be accessed through several chapter menus to get them to play. For a child, it would be hard to pick them out of the tin set if they wanted to watch them, so now it is much easier for them to see all 3 of these Xmas classics in one easy step. It's too bad the colors are muted on Small One.

Germany's hot trance duo Blank and Jones is here with an "artist" album, and compared to many, many DJ's who come out with sub par artist attempts, this one comes through with 9 strong tracks out of the 14 on the US version (the import has a few variances with A Forest vocal mix and some other remixes not included on this one).I think there was something up with securing the rights to the Cure's lead singer who sings on A Forest, as only 3 instrumental remixes are on here and not the actual original track featuring his vocals, which does appear on the import. That's quite alright with me, because I think the track works much better as an instrumental as Ron Van Den Beuken proves this with one of his trademark high energy trance remixes of the track. It just might be the best track on the album. There's a shorter edit of his remix too. Then there is the Exor remix of A Forest which starts out very slow, but picks up nicely.Another stunner is the awesome trance vocal Perfect Silence with Bobo on vocals. This is one of my favorite vocal trance tracks for the end of '04/start of '05 and the album version is excellent, but even better is the super fast club mix found on the CD single (along with a sexy video). Mind of the Wonderful is the only other vocal track on here and it's a smooth flowing, long (9:00+) track that really puts you in a groove.Zero Gravity is standard catchy trance instrumental that we've come to expect from B&J; and it is very good. It can also be found on ATB's DJ in the Mix 2 in the form of a super remix by Envio. Flowtation is a sweet melodic track with some bouncy synths and a female voice whispering "flowtation". Waiting For The Light is another melodic track sounding somewhat similiar to Flowtation, but with an ecclectic twist. Stars Shine Bright is another above average instrumental with a smidgen of female vocal, and also check out the Sam Sharp remix of it found on Trance Mixed Anthems Vol. 1.The downside to this CD is that tracks 1-3 (1 is only an intro) and tracks 10 & 11 are all pretty lousy. Other than that, it would be a 5 star rating; nonetheless, this album is well worth it for the trance fan and it's high above many other DJ attempts at artist albums.

The previous Time Out releases featured continuous mixes by the listed DJ (including a great techno mix by Black Strobe on Time Out Paris) with a double sided, dual disc and the DVD features on the flipside. The latest installment, Berlin, sadly only features a tracklisting compiled by Ellen, as I was very disappointed to realize the tracks were not DJ mixed. It's also quite odd, as some tracks continuously play into the next (kind of a soft mix into one another), but others stop prior to the next one starting. Most tracks play out for their entire durations. We will still get two DJ mixes from Ellen this year: the 4th installment in her BoogyBytes mix series (as Modeselektor is about to release the 3rd), and a mix for Fabric.Aside from my disappointment of it not being a full DJ mix, Allien has compiled a list of some very good techno goodies, including two of the most popular tech house/minimal tracks of 2006, me's Rej and Booka Shade's In White Rooms. There is also a stunning Carl Craig remix of Rhythm & Sound's Poor People Must Work. Ellen has ecclectic taste in music, and this one is no different, as she adds a punk track, and one classic rock song that is actually sung in German by David Bowie.The DVD portion really impressed me, as it surpasses the others in this series (Time Out Paris was only 24 minutes total), and they have gone to a separate disc and added much more content. It is also chock full of more techno and IDM tracks that are not on the CD portion. It starts off with a very well produced 48 minute documentary hosted by the &uuml;bercute Ellen, who takes us shopping for clothes and records, and hangs out with other electronic artists like Modeselektor, Seth Hodder, and even Richie Hawtin, who all chat briefly on camera. She mostly speaks English, but some portions are subtitled when she speaks German. On top of that, the background music is full of tracks from Ellen's own current and back catalog, which makes this a well rounded 48 minute tour full of great sights and sounds.The DVD still has more to come, with segments ranging from 8 to 27 minutes, concetrating on shopping, food, clubs, accomodations, and other miscellaneous sites in and around Berlin. And all this set to even more juicy techno tracks, that I believe are mostly from Ellen's BPitch Control label. It's just the music playing, with informational text at the bottom as they visit many locations. I wish they provided a tracklisting! There is a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes of video footage, between these segments and Ellen's portion, all set to the best musical background one could ever want for a documentary!This is a great purchase, and could have been a truly overwhelming release, had it just had a full DJ mix by Ellen on the CD, but what we do have is an incredible amount of techno music and one very well produced DVD video on Berlin.

After two stunning GU's in '05 from Danny Howells and Nick Warren, we had to wait until late 2006 to get the only release of the year from their prolific GU series, #29 by half of the Deep Dish duo, Sharam. It's less progressive than Warren's and more upbeat than Howells, so it's more like a danceable Miami. If you liked Miami, but wanted some faster paced house, this is it.There are a lot of vocals on both discs, but they are all good tracks, especially the one to open disc 1, a stunning remix by Nicka & Asle of the Julie Dennis voiced Sugar (Sweet Thing). It's a killer track to start the mix, although I wasn't keen on the choice to start disc 2, an old school house tune that just didn't cut it for me. Aside from that opening track on disc 2, and where he lets the Deep Dish remix of Paul Van Dyk's The Other Side play a little too long on disc 1, I thought both discs were great. I liked disc 2 slightly better, only because of the incredible line-up of tracks making up the latter portion of the mix (tracks 8-14).You've got great vocals, chunky house tunes, thumping dance floor beats, some guitars and cellos thrown in for good measure, all adding up to a fine release for the GU series. I actually liked Dubfire's Toronto Afterclub mix a tad better than Sharam's, but I think he is going to have his work cut out for him when he tries to top this with his own solo GU mix due out this year. Also due out in February is Nick Warren's GU30, and Adam Freeland is set to do GU32, after Dubfire's 31. I don't know if all 3 will be released in 2007, but at least two should be, which is at least one more than '06!

I don't mean it has less production than other limited releases, I just meant it's a little short on bonus features in that long book. It's the same fold out book format as the previous two GU's and it's also filled with location photography like the the others. The one thing the other two had were interviews and bios about some of the residents of Miami and Shanghai. They weren't the most interesting of features, but at least it was more than just the annoying Dom Phillips sleeve notes. It's just the notes and the photos. If GU hasn't used a better writer than Dom after 29 releases, I don't think we'll ever get that benefit.Now, onto the mixes:After two stunning GU's in '05 from Danny Howells and Nick Warren, we had to wait until late 2006 to get the only release of the year from their prolific GU series, #29 by half of the Deep Dish duo, Sharam.

Over a year after their smash hit Flashdance, Deep Dish finally releases the artist album to put it on!We start off with 2 Morel sung tracks (and I have to point out right away that I was never a big fan of Morel's voice) that are both very, very good. Deep Dish have come up with the melody and lyrics to make even the annoying Morel sound very agreeing. His voice is very different from anything in any music genre, but they have found a way to mesh it very nicely here.Track 3 needs no introduction. Track 4, the instrumental house track Swallow Me, is one of the best tracks on the CD. Track 5 is another track by the singer of Flashdance, and it's decent, but nothing as special as Flashdance or the superb new single Say Hello (track 7).Track 6, suprisingly, is another good Morel track (I think I'm actually starting to like this guy now). Track 8 is very puzzling, as it's basically just an updated remix of Stevie Nicks' Dreams. Not sure why it was made, so I just scratch my head and listen to it, as it's actually pretty decent. Now, track 10 is called Sexy Ill and track 8 is called Dub Shepherd, but I think they names got switched because Dub Shepherd is the sexy track, with the breathy vocals, and Sexy Ill is the first of the 2 tracks on the CD I dislike. It's an old school sounding instrumental which does nothing for me.Sergio's theme (a nice ambient track), and the Dubfire sung In Love With a Friend are up next, and the CD unfortunately ends on a sour note to me, the Dire Straits/Flashdance mix. I grew up with the original Money for Nothing song, which is a classic rock tune of it's time, and I don't think it has any place being mixed with Flashdance. It sounds very, very odd to me.As a bonus, you get a 2nd CD with remixes of their two singles and both videos.An artist album by anyone with 11 out of 13 tracks being above average is exceptional, even more so for a the house music genre. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!

The gliding, building melody of Ame's now classic techno track Rej is as catchy as minimal techno can get, and one is easily hooked from the first listen. It's also a track that doesn't seem to lose momentum even after hearing it this year on no less than a dozen mixes and compilations. It's a stunning effort by this tech house duo, and their new mix CD Mixing is nothing short of spectacular either. An artist of the year candidate, and quite possibly, the track of the year.This CD single contains the 8 minute original, the Pastaboys club and dub mixes, a short beatless edit, and two remixes by A Hundred Birds, who make it interesting by using classical instruments to give the track a symphonic feel. The only thing about a track this good, is that there isn't a remix that can improve it. Stick with the original, which is a must have, and the rest are just sidenotes.

This UK region 2 box set comes in a maroon, heavy stock cardboard flip open box, with two large DVD cases inside. This is the complete UK version and it is digitally remastered with subtitles/closed captioning. The early episodes do look very grainy, but this improves as you get to the later episodes. The remastering seems to have improved the colors and clarity, but it's still a show that started in the late 80's so you can't expect HD quality viewing, even with the remastering.The two large clamshell plastic cases that house all the discs, keep all 18 discs securely in place. The outer cardboard case is made of a very thick stock, and it's much more solid than the thin cardboard that holds most DVD boxed sets.You really can't go wrong with this set if you have the capability to play region 2 PAL DVD's. The 18th disc has bonus features and interviews.

Spacey electro and disco conneisseur Lindstrm shows his more quiet side with a downtempo, ecclectic vocal showing through the decades. He brings together some obscure vocalists, both old and new, along with a some familiar chords, such as Carly Simon, Dusty Springfield, and Sly and the Family Stone. There are a few spots in the mix where the tempo picks up, but it's mostly about subtle musical twists in genre, and drawn out, soulful turns on the mic. I like the fact there's almost an equal share between male and female vocals. There's also an excellent spoken word track by recent newcomer, Farah, which fits deep into the mix perfectly, with it's lush, building italo disco soundscape backing her. It's also found on the superb, new, italo disco and synth pop compilation,After Dark.It definitely took me until about the 3rd listen to really warm up to some of the tracks. After that, I find it sets a very enjoyable background mood, full of interesting sounds and songs I would never have listened to otherwise. The LateNightTales, Back To Mine, and DJ-Kicks series are all about introduction to new, lost gems in the music world, and I'm definitely entertained by what Lindstrm has brough to the table in this mix. It's a fine flowing mix, with very interesting stuff to kick back to and enjoy.

You can buy and read all the other cartoon collectible toy books ever published, but you won't find as many characters or as many figural toys represented in this guide. It is an excellent collection of so many obscure characters, as well as all the major ones. If you collect cartoon toys, especially figural ones, don't pass this one up. It also includes nearly every vinyl figure the company Dakin has every produced. A must for the Dakin collector.

A poignant look into the personal world of sending Xmas cards. A collection of personal postcards from the 30's to the 90's, showing all kinds of families, dogs, and even single people, who bared their likeness to send holiday greetings to family and friends. My only displeasure is that this book stopped way too soon, as I could have gone on and on in a book ten times this size. Great glimpses into American life over the years.

This is essentially the best 2 disc mix in '06, as far as any electronic/dance genre is concerned. With the huge influx of tech house and minimal into the dance scene this year, this follows suit, as both artists featured here break away from their normal sets.King Unique strides far from their standard house tunes they love to grind, to come up with an all star line up of some of the best tech house and minimal tracks of 2006. They surely know how to pick 'em, with a who's who of the best artists this year: Thomas Schumacher, Claude VonStroke, Wighnomy Bros, Booka Shade, and Sascha Funke. Speaking of Funke, this whole mix is full of incredible melodies, such as one of my favorite minimal tracks of the year, the truly sublime In Between Days by Sascha Funke. Combined with so many other monster tracks like Booka Shade's Night Falls, and Wighnomy Bros. Moppal Kiff, you would think you are listening to a radio show countdown of the best tech house and minimal tracks of the year. Not a dull track in sight.Over to CD 2, where Nubreed, filter out just about all their trademark breakbeat, and leave us with a stunning mix of high energy electro and techno. If you ever want to hear the definition of "blowing up a mix" just listen to tracks 6-9, as we are bombasted with 3 of the hardest hitting electro tracks out there, starting with their own track Subtronic, heading into Future Funk Squad's Audio Damage, and culminating with the incredicle D. Ramirez remix of the Plump DJs Electric Disco. If you aren't bouncing off the wall by the time this track hits, you don't know how to "feel" dance music. This is top to bottom an explosive mix by Nubreed.Never a dull moment with these two discs, you get minimal, techno, tech house, and electro, all rolled up into the best 2 disc set in a long, long time. This release is continuing to prove that Australia's EQ/Stomp label is at the top of the dance music world right now, with their Balance Series, this fairly new Electric mix series (Gavin Keitel did Electric 1), and another great release late in '06 called Honkytonks, which is a techno and minimal 2 disc mix that is a tribute to a closing night club in Australia. They are a very exciting label and one to keep an eye on into '07.

I'm not sure why I bought 5, after being so disappointed with 4, but I had to give Tiesto the benefit of the doubt, in hoping that he would learn from his mistakes and capitalize on making an even better ISOS5. He has done just that. While it's not perfect (particulary a big chunk of disc 1), it's a much better set than last year's and one worth keeping and giving some solid play. Gone are the attempts to incorporate progressive house into the mix and he's back to just about all melodic and progressive trance.Track 1 on disc 1 started off very melodic and sounded like I was in for a ride like 1-3 of the Sunrise series. It ended there, as tracks 2-4 were some very mediocre sounding vocal tracks. When track one completely kicked out to be replaced by the dull lyrics of track 2, I was rather disappointed. Tracks 5, 6, 7 didn't fare much better, with some dull melodies, and an inconsistent flow. Track 8 is finally a decent vocal track, but then tracks 9 and 10 quickly drift back trivial trance territory. Luckily, starting with the always reliable Jes on voclas for track 11, we get a series of tracks that from here on in, closes disc 1 in exciting fashion.Next up is disc 2, which after a nice melodic opening like disc 1, gets right back to some lively tracks like the end of disc 1 and the best thing is, IT DOESN'T STOP! This entire disc is a big departure for Tiesto, as it's some deeper progressive stuff then what he is known for and use to spinning, but he hits it dead on and comes up trumps with an intoxicating ride through superb, epic trance. A reviewer noted that this disc sounded a lot like Markus Schulz's Miami '05 and I agree. If you liked that one, you are going to love this disc 2.If this one had a better set of tracks on disc 1, it could have been an all around winner, but it's very difficult to pull off what Markus and Cosmic Gate did last year: have a 2 disc run of all great tracks. One thing's for sure, it's a great mix and highly recommended for the good stuff that you have to kind of searh for on disc 1, and ALL the good stuff served up on disc 2. It's disappointing that he couldn't pick some better tracks for disc 1; and still no Surnise remix or track of his own. It's not your usual Tiesto, but it doesn't have to be!

Disc 1 opens up with a rather non-descript Lights Out intro, which wouldn't have been missed had it not been there, and then opens the door to some of the hottest, sweatiest, deep and dirty house you will hear right now. Track 3, Mars by Nick K, begins rather innocently until the squelching melody slowly fades in and completely envelops the track. The melody fades out for a moment midway through, and then the next time it fades in, the build up is ecstatic, climaxing in one incredible beat explosion. This is easily my favorite track of the entire set.Electro artist Trentemoller checks in next with a super remix of Friday. The whisper-like vocals in the track are turned up so loud, you have to turn the treble down or risk ripping through some speakers. It's nuts!The rest of this disc pours on the beats in sweaty, dirty fashion, with some quirky vocal tracks, and some classic tribal house. Disc 1 really doesn't have a bad track on it, and it culminates with Lawler's buzzing remix of Conjur's The Skeleton Key (Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect).Disc 2 starts again with the take it or leave it Lights Out intro, and then gets into some lighter house music. Through track 6 is a decent mix, but you never really get the dark, sexy vibes of disc 1 back on track, and by the awful track 7, that and the next 4 tracks are very dull. Toward the end of the disc, the tracks start to heat up, but it ends without ever capturing the allure of Disc 1. Back to that awful track 7: it is a male vocal track where the guy just speaks the alphabet and some blurbs to go with each letter. It is truly an embarassing track.Now, I wanted to like something on Disc 3, but listening to each track, they were all uneven with awkward melodies, and nothing I could latch onto. I didn't like a single track. It was all a funky house, without a lot of drums, and the beats simply did not move me.You may even opt to get the regular edition, as Disc 3 is just not worth anything in my opinion. I don't know how the packaging for the 2 disc set is, but this 3 disc set comes in a cool looking fold out, glow in the dark cover, but the foam prongs that keep the discs in place are frustrating to use.Overall, worth picking up for the incredibly hot sounds on disc 1!

Danish duo Sparkling's debut album is nothing short of par excellence in terms of being, from top to bottom, a consistently strong electronic indie rock effort. Great lyrics and crisp vocals from lead singer Carsten Bentzen, backed by live instruments and electronic effects from Lars Lundgaard Jensen.Two Danish singers also make strong guest appearances: established sultry jazz singer Susi Hyldgaard, and Danish actor and singer of the band BAAL, Bjrn Fjstad. Bjrn's strong vocals on the opening track are near match for Carsten's, so the transition into the second track is barely noticed. Susi lends a huge hand for a luscious duet, in perhaps the strongest track on the album, Stay For a While.This duo has managed to use just the right amount of electronic sounds and live vocals and acoustics, to pull off the perfect blend and sound of modern Euro indie rock. Somewhat downtempo, but always exciting, each of the 10 tracks is far above average, and it's an album that deserves to be engulfed in it's entirety. I've already heard two tracks from their new album, due out in 2007, and I can say it sounds as if I will quickly be snatching that one up as well.

You get one full length movie, done in excellent looking computer animation, and two animated shorts from the standard cel animation tv show. I am usually not in favor of some of these modern, CGI looking movies, but this one doesn't stray very much from the characters normal likenesses and looks good. The two bonus tv shorts are from the 2nd batch of Rescue Heroes animation, which featured better animation than the 1st. You will notice a big difference in how some of the characters were drawn, especially Rocky Canyon. He had a very fat face and looked bulky in the 1st batch, but his face got much more realistic looking in the 2nd batch, and he looks leaner. They definitely found better animators for the 2nd series, and it shows in the character's faces.All the videos and DVD's that come free with the toys are usually the 1st batch of shows, which is why this set is nice to have the newer ones, even though there are only 2. If you are looking for the rest of the shows on DVD, you can get an order form with most of the figures, advertising 4 volumes of Rescue Heroes animated shows. Volumes 1 & 2 feature the older shows (2001) and Volumes 3 & 4 feature the 2003, updated animation ones. They are not for sale on Amazon and can only be ordered through Fisher Price (which takes much shorter than their listed 6 weeks time), or through online auction.If your child is a fan of the toys or the show, they should love this movie, which features tons of action right from the start. The movie also features some secondary characters such as Rip Rockefeller and Pat Pending. The main characters of Jake Justice, Billy Blazes, Wendy Waters, Ariel Flyer, Jack Hammer, and Rocky Canyon are all here, with Rocky getting a lot of screen time, as the movie focuses on his eagerness to be a RH team leader.A must have for any Rescue Heroes fan. This DVD is VERY hard to find in most local stores, so I would just order right here through Amazon.

A horror film with lots of tension and a believable scenario involving the main characters. No psychopaths wielding axes, aliens taking over bodies, zombies roaming the earth, or psychological nightmares. It's just a simple, plausible plot where 3 people are stuck on a ski lift, 50 feet in the air, and the atrocities they endure trying to free themselves. A little gore and a lot of suspense. The main drawbacks were some slow moving moments, and some early side plots that really don't go anywhere and appear only as attempts to keep the film at a normal run time.Overall, if you're looking for a real life terror flick, this is it. A simple yet believable twist in the horror genre. Keep in mind it is still a B-movie, so don't expect juicy dialogue or sweeping visuals, but you may hardly notice once the suspense kicks in.

A nice, low bridge, with an easy-for-young-kids-to-use lever, where they must open it to allow trains to pass underneath. It is all wood except for the green sides of the bridges and lever, and it's solidly built. This thing is so low, it will never tip over in your setup. My son always has to have this bridge connected to everything he sets up, and he hasn't got bored with it since he got it.

For some reason, I popped in Disc 2 first. I think it was because I was eager to hear the Trentemoller track. I was blown away by the techy, yet funky and melodic house found throughout this mix. There isn't a bad track on here, from start to finish. I figured Disc 1 had to be as good, but it was a lot different, not just in the mixing, but it featured a lot of spacey, robot tech house that takes a while to get used to. I am liking it more and more with each listen, and I really like his two original tracks, Robophobia and EyeAmComputer, which blend sci-fi vocal snippets, with a full out tech house beats assault.Overall, it's a style that needs repeated listens, and if you just don't like it, you may never will, but if you can get as excited as I was hearing this innovative mix and great tech house stuff, you will agree it's the best mix of it's kind to date!One last note: the back of the CD has the tracklisting wrong. They forgot to add two tracks for the two versions of Outta My Mind, so it looks like there are only 15 tracks, when there are 16. Tracks 10-15 printed on the CD do not match up with the CD, but you can just add one number to each of them.

This and Bad Weather were Martin Parr's two first major early 80's books, and both were done in a medium he no longer uses: Black & White. Parr's unrelenting use of color beginning in the mid 80's would spark a turn in his work where he would never look back. In this book, (full title: A Fair Day, Photographs from the West of Ireland) we get a documentary side of Parr which would carry on to The Cost of Living, capturing common people of their country, engaging in public events. You get fairs, ballroom dances, country homes, abandoned cars, and just everyday outings that the people of rural Ireland encountered. Two of my favorite captures are the blurry scene of people stuffing the entrance to the Mayflower Ballroom, and two apparently intoxicated bar patrons sitting beside a flutist and fiddler.This one and his earlier book, Bad Weather, are commanding some very high prices on the secondary market. If you can't get your hands on them, we can only hope he will consider reprinting them.

You get 3 full tracks, one small intro track, and 14 tracks of samples from the 3 main ones. Robophobia and EyeAmComputer are 2 hot robo funk tunes featured in James's new full length CD Utilities. You get both full original versions. Robophobia differs slightly from the JZ Childhood edit found on Utilities, and EyeAmComputer seems the same but it's a lot longer in it's full version. You also get an exclusive track called Skanksuary, which is a quirky track going off in all sorts of techy directions, and laced with a smidgen of acid. It's an outstanding track, making all 3 main singles on here sure winners.You also get the Quantum Realities opening of the Utilies mix CD, and then you get a bunch of samples and sounds taken from the different parts of all 3 of his original production tracks. Great to use if you want to spice up your tech mix, especially if you want to add some robot funk! 18 tracks in all.A great EP, but a little steep in it's import price.

Just like Utilities, the hottest stuff is on Disc 2, while Disc 1 suffers slightly from a few dull tracks. The quality of tracks seems to suffer with the last half of disc 1 (with the exception of track 12), so you may want to pop it out early and switch to disc 2!Aside from getting his tracks perfect, James' relentless mixing skills and techo house sound are the hottest out there now. I can't wait to track down Sounds in Motion and 001, his first two mixes, as I am completely enthralled with Utilities and Alive. Actually, I have barely been listening to anything else lately, and recently got a hold of his 2004 Essential Mix which features a great mix of REM, movie soundtracks and sound bites, and tech house! Well worth obtaining for the Zabiela fan.If you are looking for a new and imaginative tech house mix, don't miss this one. His stuff takes a few listens to grow on you, but it inevitably will if you give it a chance! And hey, anything featuring the Daleks has gotta be good, even if the Daleks are Zabiela created!

I almost didn't find this item, due to the rather inaccurate product desciption, but it's the 2nd MB set sold on Amazon, and part of 5 Adventure Sets. The other large one is the Dragon Castle, and the other 3 smaller ones are the Snake Jungle, Harbor Patrol, and Auto Center. They are all multi-level, interconnectable, playsets for Matchbox cars. Small enough to fold-up and take anywhere (after careful placement of the contents) and they become an even larger play area when you get more of them and interconnect them. You only get 2 ramps per set, and very odd positioning of the ramp connectors, making it somewhat difficult to get certain sets to link up, and nearly impossible to interconnect them all with ramps when you have all 5.Despite the very thin plastic used, it's very durable, except for one side of one of the building frames, which keeps popping out of it's hinge (but does not break). There's a lot to do in this tiny area, with a wrecking ball, hook, two building roofs to snap on, a car launching cement mixer, and 2 levels of play. My son has a lot of fun with these playsets, and likes to close them up, and bring them from room to room. Each of these sets comes with one vehicle.Parents of kids with younger siblings, please keep in mind that most of these have some smaller pieces, and the most hazardous are in the Snake Jungle set, with a VERY small trophy, and a round boulder. On most of the other sets, the small attachments were oblong shaped, and seem to be a tad larger than pieces that would normally present a choking problem.All these sets are recommended for Matchbox fans, as the multi-level play areas, and even the thin scale design, add to the playability.

For some reason, Amazon looks to only be selling the 2 larger sets out of this series of 5 Matchbox Adventure Sets that are currently in stores. They are portable, fold-up, and come with one car each. They interconnect with each other to form a larger play area. There is one other larger set like this one, the Construction Zone, and 3 smaller sets: Snake Jungle, Auto Center, and Harbor Patrol.This one is a castle theme, complete with a car launching, crossbow catapult, and a red plastic dragon, with an opening and closing mouth. The one noticable flaw in this set is that the dragon is suppose to have a secret door that opens to the upper level, when you pull apart a section of his body. It is hinged and looks like it should open separate from his body, so that a car can fit easily through the tunnel when it's open, however the entire dragon must be snapped off at once, which causes the body to get in the way of cars. One little extra latch was apparently forgotten in the design.This set, and most of the others come with two platform ramps, which can be moved around the playset, and used to connect with the others sets. Having all 5, I must say it is nearly impossible due to the positions and sizes of the ramps, to connect them all in an ideal arrangement. You are left using the clip that holds the set closed as a connector, which isn't flat so cars can't drive across.Aside from a few design flaws, these sets have been a lot of fun for my son. The multi levels, tunnels, and nooks and crannies that you can play with your cars in are plentiful. With it's thin plastic, you would think the set would fall apart easily, but it doesn't and is securely made. Keep in mind the small extra pieces, cars, and ramps, have to be placed just so in order to close the portable case back up.One last note, the Snake Jungle playset, comes with the smallest accessory (choking hazard) pieces of the 5 sets. It has a small boulder, and a VERY small trophy. While the other 4 sets have some tiny pieces, they are all pretty oddly shaped and fairly larger than most under 3 choking size items. You definitely want to remove the two items from Snake Jungle if you have little ones around.

What ever made this show get released on DVD prior to all the other more popular Rankin/Bass specials is beyond me, but I am quite pleased to see it, nonetheless! I don't even think this was ever out on video, so it's here first in all DVD splendor.Nice to see Danny Kaye in Denmark with all the kids. My son loves the animagic the most, but has no trouble paying attention to Danny and all the kids having a grand ole time in great Danish settings. It's a shame the rest of the Danny Kaye series never materialized as they invisioned it.

Gone are the slammin' hip trance sounds of Seaman's other 2 GU releases, and in comes a more housey, break beat style, tropical funk that I just don't care for. Anyone liking this style of house may be into this CD, but if you marveled at his past GU's like the solid Cape Town, you will be disappointed with this offering as I am. It's hard to believe he went with such a contrasting style from what he was use to playing. Not one for my collection.

In early '06, Swedish tech house artist, DJ, and remixer Martinez, a very hot commodity in the tech world these days, delivered a stunning tech house label mix from Audiomatique. That mix was actually recorded at Triple-O Studios in Copenhagen, home of Martinez's own label, Out of Orbit Recordings . Now he decided to turn his focus to his own label, and create another stellar mix out of all Out of Orbit tracks, which range from the 2nd Triple-O 12" from 2004, right up to the new Phil Stumpf single, Cut, just released in January of 2007.Inspired by Richie Hawtin's Transitions mix, Martinez also uses Ableton Live to create a unique mix formed from the fragments, layers, and loops from dozens of individual tracks. Taking as little as 2 to as much as 10 tracks, he forms one bond as a single, unnamed track, linking all of them into one energetic tech house mix. As Hawtin's was an intoxicating journey through layers and soundscapes of minimal techno, Martinez sort of simplifies things and creates tracks that could more easily be heard as an individual single. The CD as a whole actually comes out sounding like it really were one DJ's mix through 19 various tech house and minimal tracks. It is also without the clutter that was prevelant on some of the tracks in Hawtin's and also Magda's recent mix. It certainly seems like Martinez is the odd many out (in a good way) in the way he created his mix.He comes up with almost entirely new tracks, born of old and current ones in his existing Triple-O catalog. While you may have a tough time picking out each individual one, there are spots where tracks like Beta Boy by Trentemller, and Martinez's remix of Jussi Pekka's Stereo Interleaved creep up to an entirely recognizable (although edited) state. Not only is this tailored to be an Out of Orbit sound, but more importantly, that trademarked Martinez sound. It plays out like one big Martinez remix and re-edit, with his signature electrified tech house that's fit to explode any dance floor. After only the first few tracks, it's head first into a swiftly moving pace, churning out more head nodding vibes then Magda's She's A Dancing Machine could even start to generate. Martinez does gives us a slight break at tracks 12 and 13, taking the tempo way down, only to pump up the BPM's once again from track 14 to the end of this exhilarating mix.This mix, Transitions, and Magda's mix are the 3 recent ones using this similar format, and I completely feel this is the most pleasing and straightforward end result of the three. A full 5 stars for the innovation in this original, high impact tech house mix, and for solidifying my top spot in the recent trend of Ableton Live mixes such as this.

Elles De Graaf, certainly not a newcomer to trance vocal, with Mind of the Wonderful with Blank and Jones, and probably her best known slice of work, Sound of Goodbye with Armin Van Buuren (as Perpetuous Dreamer), clocks in a monster summer anthem with Catch. Yes, I know the Martin Roth version is 3 minutes shorter than the vinyl, and yes, the hot club mix is missing too, but the fact remains that this track is one of the best remakes ever done in electronic/dance, and I have to say, with each listen, especially of the Martin Roth mix, I like it better than the original. You also get a good instrumental (nowhere near cheesy as the other reviewer states), and the video, making this a decent buy.I know Kosheen fans are going to be in an uproar, but I really liked their original version when it came out, and still do, however their lead singer has a folk like voice, and was never suited for dance, they just happened to have a few vocal tracks that worked. This track with Elles De Graaf now on vocal, perks the track up to a livelier level, better suited for trance, and when you grab just about the best remixer of the moment, Martin Roth, you end up with the hardest hitting track of the summer, and possibly the year.

Martinez offers us a label mix of some of the best current tech house. For the Trentemoller fan, there are 3 of his tracks, plus an incredible remix of Martinez's Shadowboxing, my pick for the best on the CD. It's a menacing track with a strong bassline. The whole CD is full of great tracks, and there truly isn't a bad one on here.Two things impressed me about this mix. One was the fact that Martinez did this all on turntables, and proves that even though tech house is well suited to be mixed via computer, that you can still do it flawlessly on vinyl. The other thing is that most DJ mixes have an increasing BPM level going on throughout the mix, starting off slower, rising to a higher pace, and then ending either high or slightly lower. Martinez mixes it up with a lot of the tracks, and drops the BPM's down from a fast one to a slightly slower paced one, and then the very next track brings it back up again. It works very well and the treat comes in not only hearing each great track, but wondering what we're going to get next.All the way around, one heck of a mix, and a must buy for 2006.

...this is certainly one of the best of the last decade! Inspector Grim is hilarious with his run-on sentences and overenthusiasm for cases which usually don't end up going his way (like in the Xmas episode when he bags the wrong group of Christmas carolers).Grim's right hand man in the 1st season (the dark haired guy with the unibrow) is much funnier than season two's guy (even though that heavy set guy ended up starring in a US sitcom). He just didn't get the lines and gags that the 1st season gave our unibrow actor.Every character in this show is strongly written and played to a tee. Goodie is also hilarious.Rowan Atkinson makes the show, of course, with his deadpan, afraid of sex and commitment, Chief Inspector role.My only knock is how come it only lasted 2 seasons??? It's better than 90% of British comedy that's been out over the years, and it only got a handful of episodes made? I heard a rumour of a season 3 coming out but not sure if it will ever materialize. Since it's been over 7 years since Season 2, it may be hard to get back into the flow of things. But I would certainly welcome it!!! Just get the original cast back!

That quote was Arthur Daley reassuring Terry McCann that the minding business is still for him. Minder, one of the best British shows in their tv history, has not had a region 1 release to date, so I am not sure why it is even listed here numerous times on Amazon, even though they all say "unavailable". Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, and George Cole as Arthur Daley were teamed up for 7 seasons from 1979-1987. It ran from 1979-1985 for series 1-6, and then had 3 years off before resuming one final year with McCann, on season 7. Seasons 8-10 resumed with Arthur's nephew, played by Gary Webster, taking over for Terry McCann, but the chemistry of Waterman and Cole were what made this show such a phenomenon. The later years, while receiving good reviews, could never be the same without Terry on the job. There were some great Arthur antics scattered throughout those later final seasons, and they are still worth a look for the true completist.Seasons 1 & 2 didn't receive high ratings on TV, and it wasn't until series 3 that the show finally became a hit. They even went back and replayed seasons 1 & 2 after series 3 went over so well. Aside from a few dull early episodes in Season 1, the rest of the episodes through season 6 were solid entertainment. Most episodes revolved around Arthur finding some nearly crooked job for him and Terry to make a nice little earner, only for him to take most of the prize money in the end, citing expenses, overhead, and other preposterous reasons to con Terry out of his share. Terry did get back at Arthur in several episodes, and more than once our lovable rogue con man ended up on the losing side of a profit.Terry McCann was an ex-boxer and ex-con, two reasons to make him the best minder, or bodyguard, in London. He often squared off against the right hand men and much-bigger-than-he hired hands of London underworld's most crooked citizens. Of course, he would always find the time to romance the leading ladies who were tied up in his latest job. Arthur's earners had Terry doing everything from minding Arab millionares to minding women's dresses.The comedic antics of George Cole really made him a legend of British TV. Everyone during those years, and even now, knows the character of Arthur Daley. Arthur and Terry usually hung out at the Winchester Club, run by Arthur's old mate, Dave. He hated it when Arthur would bring his business inside and rough up his club. Dave was the only other regular character in Minder, besides Terry and Arthur. There were also the minor characters of Des, Terry's car thief friend, the on-the-take Inspector Rycott, and the righteous Inspector Chisolm, who all made numerous appearances in the show.There were two Region 2 Minder Specials released on DVD, along with the movie, Minder on the Orient Express. Seasons 1-10 were all released on Region 2 DVD, and they are also getting released on Region 4 DVD's from Australia, which feature uncut episodes with their original ad break captions. They also feature on seasons 1 & 3, none other than George Cole featured on the audio commentary. They have more extras than the Region 2 releases, however I have noticed on some episodes, that the picture quality isn't as good as the Region 2 discs. You will find the Minder Specials and The Minder On The Orient Express as extras on these Region 4 season sets, rather than sold separately like the Region 2 releases.I am not sure Minder will ever get a region 1 release, so you may have to seek out the UK or Australian discs, if you have the capability to play them. If you do, you will reap the rewards of getting to see arguably one of the best British TV shows of all time.

It figures, after already writing good reviews about Tool Tech Billy Blazes and Tool Tech Jack Hammer (but noting that the durability is a question) we get Roger Houston, and right away there is a problem with his pull string. We are now also having problems with Jack Hammer's and Billy Blazes'. Roger's engine, even when working fine the first day we got him, usually got stuck against his legs, and would prevent it from working at all. The trick is to stand him slighty bent forward, so the jet pack propellers can spin without touching the back of his legs. Now, one day later, when you pull the string, it barely moves back inside or makes the propellers spin.Our Billy Blazes string is getting completely stuck when you pull it all the way out, and you have to jar the axe to get it to work. Our Jack Hammer's drill is now moving very, very slowly as well. So that's 3 out of 3 Tool Tech figures that after less than a week (and less than 24 hours on Roger) are not functioning properly (but not completely broke).Aside from the tool feature, this is a great looking figure, with him in his all white space suit. The only thing that is annoying is they are using the old Roger Houston face mold, which has also been used for Gil Gripper and Holden Breath, so we have 3 look alikes now!

I don't see the appeal, being from a time where cartoons were more life-like, or at least more animal-like, but whether it's the cool colors and graphics, or the wacky shapes of the characters, it keeps the kids fully engulfed. Lots of episodes and a long run time are also a plus. A very nice kids DVD, recommended for ages 3-8.

What I think made the Traveling Wilburys so special was the spontaneous formation of these 5 &uuml;ber-rockers. George Harrison, wanting a little help for an extra track for his single This Is Love, got much more than just a B-side in what I consider one of the best pop rock songs of the 80's: Handle With Care. An idea for an album followed, and these extremely talented singer-songwriters formed a superb collection of tracks which would become Traveling Wilburys Volume 1. There isn't a single bad song in Volume 1, and it's no wonder it's listed as one of Rolling Stones 100 greatest albums of the 80's.After Handle With Care, which needs no introduction, we get Bob Dylan's sexually suggestive rocker, Dirty World, followed by the country sounding Rattled, voiced by Jeff Lynne. On an album full of staggering hits, Rattled may very well be decent elsewhere, but may be my choice for the weakest of this album, if it's even right to call any of these songs weak. The catchiest track of the album, Last Night is probably the next strongest song, although Roy turns in a stunner with Not Alone Any More right after it. The album continues with the guys taking vocal and writing turns, and originally ended with End Of The Line.I know some people may still feel volume 1 is superior, and considering the price of this set, and how much they can probably go out and get the out of print Volume 1 once this collection hits, some may be considering just finding the first Volume cheap. Well, one very strong argument not to get the original is that you are missing out on the George Harrison song Maxine. It's vintage George and it's a shock that this never made it on an album. It's a great never officially released song that every Harrison fan should have. Like a Ship is decent, but it's Maxine that makes these Bonus Tracks on Vol. 1 so special.While there are two unofficial Volume 2's (a bootleg containing demos and extended tracks; and Full Moon Fever, Tom Petty's album where George, Roy, and Jeff collaborated) Disc 2 in this collection is the DVD, which features a 25 minute documentary shot in 1988 which covers the formation of the band and their work on some of the album's songs, including Tweeter and the Monkey Man. It also includes all of the band's 5 videos. The picture quality is fairly sharp, however I am not convinced they were digitally remastered. I liked all the videos, with maybe the exception of the Wilbury Twist, which seemed to be the End of the video artistic Line for the band, as it was a little on the dull side. Handle With Care is easily the best of the videos, just based on Roy's slight head bobbing up and down, when he first comes in to full camera view to start singing his part. A nice Roy touch to the video, to go with his immense contribution to the song. The End of the Line, with the band playing while traveling on a train, is probably my next favorite.Disc 3 is Volume 3, and the second album released by the group. It is sadly missing the recently departed Roy Orbison. Some say this lost a little magic for Volume 3, however we get some final great songs from the band. Their single She's My Baby starts it off, followed by my pick for the best song of the album, the harmony filled Inside Out, which features an almost Beatles like 60's chorus and lyrics, albeit with a touch of Tom's unique voice thrown in to give it an updated twist.Bob Dylan is featured prominently over the next several tracks, including If You Belonged to Me, which is all his vocals, and my second best pick off this album, Where Were You Last Night, which features George and Bob taking turns with the vocals. Two 50's sounding rockers are featured with New Blue Moon and 7 Deadly Sins, and there's the humorous country tune Poor House, and the somewhat silly new dance called the Wilbury Twist. Rounding out my 3 top picks off this album is Tom featuring on the song Cool Dry Place. It's a more subdued sounding Tom that sounds great. The bonus tracks on this album are a big treat as well, with George, Bob, and Tom all taking turns singing on Nobody's Child, a poignant song about orphans, and what is probably Jeff's best vocal contribution on either disc, the Del Shannon remake Runaway. Another reason to pick up this new collection.This is overall a fine slice of 80's rock history, and a complete showcase all in one place, for a very shortlived but now legendary band. All their videos, all their songs, plus a few extra bonuses, make this set a no-brainer. Don't even think about taking the cheap way out and going for the old CD's, as you'll surely be missing out. One final note, the DVD is NTSC, but also listed as being compatible for Regions 1-6, which I believe is pretty much the same as a Region 0.

I agree with posts that it attracts deer, as one day after putting up the stakes, I had 3 inspecting the area. I couldn't see if they got shocked or not, but it's been 5 weeks now and haven't seen any since. Whether it's the fact they got scared or not, it seems to be keeping them away. Not only helps for garden damage, but great to keep them away from bringing deer ticks into your yard. One thing to note was the cotton balls they provide have to be broken apart to fit inside the top of the stake hole. Directions show to just shove a full one inside, but it won't fit.

The only drawback is that it is difficult to fit Hal into the helicopter and take him back out. Other than that, my son usually uses it without a driver, and just flies it around, rescuing other toys in the house with the grappling hook. This toy is not electronic, but when you pull the grappling hook fully out, you depress the gray button on the side and it makes the propeller spin, along with a grinding sound, so it makes it seem like it does have batteries in it. To the reviewer who said it didn't work, you may not be pulling out the cord, because if you press it with the cord fully inside, the propeller does not move.The helicopter is in 2 pieces inside the package, and when you get it out and assembled, it is much bigger than you would think. An excellent buy.

I know one main complaint was that there are no more Mission Select Rescue Heroes figures left in stores, as they were discontinued, and some of the aftermarket prices were getting up there (especially Rocky Canyon, the hardest to find in the set). Well, the Robotz figure line that is in stores now features figures with the same connectors on their back, so you can get them to talk. I don't know if it will be the main phrases that would be said if you had the Mission Select figures, but they will talk. For instance, when I hook a Mission Select backpack from Billy Blazes (the only Mission Select figure we have) up to Rocky Canyon, Rocky says a phrase for each turn of the dial. They sound like the follow up phrases, as if he was the second figure communicating with another mission select figure, but you still get some voice interaction!! The Mission Select, Voice Tech, and Robotz figures should all come with the same metal contacts on their backs (except the ones like Robotz Gil Gripper, whose robot stands alone and does not connect to him), so they will all work in some way with each other's items.As for the MACC, it's definitely the center of the Rescue Heroes world, being the biggest playset released from the toy line to date. While it may not be the most exciting, it gives your children a central area to congregate the figures and vehicles. At least it can keep the figures from being all over the house! I think for the size and money, it could have featured some trap doors or compartments, but the elevator and Mission Command voices from RH leader Warren Waters are all you get.

Go out and buy this CD right now if you are a trance fan, as it contains some of the best new tracks for 2005. Johan Gielen (one half of the big remix/DJ team Svenson & Gielen) mixes and ecclectic collection of high energy and melodic instrumental trance, with just a few vocal tracks thrown in, including the smash hit of the year thus far, Find by the Ridgewalkers featuring El. Everyone has been spinning the Andy Moor Mix, which you will find on here, but you should seek out the even better Kyau vs. Albert remix which will be on their new mix CD Positive Ways 4 released late Feb.Johan's mixing is incredibly flawless through nearly all of the CD, as you BARELY feel that you've passed into the next track, and through a few transitions, you can't even tell.Johan's 2 solo tracks are very good, with Flash being the standout, as it's a incredibly fast, banging track. Wait 'til you hear the track San Andreas by Miller and Fijneman (DJ Cor Fijenman that is) and get to 3:30 into it, as it literally blows up and will leave your jaw on the floor! Some great new tracks from Re: Locate, Airscape, and Solid Globe can also be found here.One HUGE error is that track 4 IS NOT Alt+F4, but rather Surrender by Above & Beyond presents Tranquility Base, which is quite alright because I think it's a much better track!! Alt+F4 is not found on here at all!GO out and BUY this if you want a super mix and all the latest trance!!

40 tracks, and I only count 6 decent ones on here. However, these 6 are not just above average, all 6 are superb. And I am not even counting the current hit by the Benassi Bros. Illusion, which I have to say I can't stand! I utterly hate Sandy's voice (hated Get Better too)! KMC/Benassi Bros. really need to bring back Dhany from I Feel So Fine!!!Here are the 6 whoppers: I Can't Let You Go by Ian Van Dahl, a nice new exclusive edit of ATB's In Love with the DJ (which says it's the new vocal edit, but it's not the new version on his DJ in the MIX CD, but rather an edited version of the original Dedicated album version), Nights in Palma by Wells &amp; Fargo (in my top 3 favorite tracks of '04 along with IVD's Where are you Now? and ATB's Marrakech), Depend on You by Ayu (in Japanese but oh so slammin of a trance track), Never Too Late by Ninja, and the vocal version of Keep on Movin by Ron Van Den Beuken (I had only heard the instrumental before, but the vocals add new light on this awesome track).Unfortunately out of the remaining 34 tracks, I'd say about half of them are average tracks, and the other half are real skip-this-track-immediately royal duds.

The camera work and direction of this film are awe-inspiring. The scenes with Mastroianni entering the psychotic woman's hospital room, shot against the completely white wall, and the overhead shot of Moreau pulling up in the car are two of the best visual shots I can think of in any movie, anywhere!A film that held my attention from start to finish (rare for an Antonioni flick), even though not a heck of a lot really happens in this film, other than a one night study of a couple's relationship. I think the two leads helped out a lot too, as Antonioni usually used lesser known stars, but picked two top notch names for this one.

Within a very short time (days) of getting this item, I kept noticing that my kids kept knocking one of the doors off (usually the far right one because it's opening is the most awkward out of them all). Then I I would see two off, and then three, and well, you get the picture. I got so sick of popping them back into place, that I just took all of them off completely. In a way, it's almost better that they pop off with force, because if they didn't, they may just break off, and then you can't put them back at all.It's the centerpiece of the train setup, and it takes up A LOT of the table. We don't have the pricey Thomas table, just a generic one that is only about an inch-and-a-half shorter, but the roundhouse takes up a ton of space. It's also very hard to make a full connecting layout to all the roundhouse's connectors. You need a lot of track, especially the small curved ones. You definitely can't buy a lot of other large buidlings/pieces to go along with it. It makes the visuals look pleasing of your train arrangement, but I found that the kids don't seem to play with it much. They usually run the trains around without going through it or using it. They are both under 4, so maybe when they are older they will get more use out of it, and we can put the doors back! The sounds are nice, the push button mechanisms to release the trains work perfect, and the tools in the back are a nice touch, so despite my greivances, it does have some good points. You just have to decide if you want to shell out the dough. I would think it over about whether you want to just buy 4 or 5 nice play buildings to take up your table, which the kids may play with more, or this one very large piece they may get bored with.

Excellent characters and performances highlight this updated version of the 70's British cult show, Survivors. Similarities abound between this and the old version, as in some of the exact same characters and plot lines, however there is enough fresh material and new faces to keep fans (like me) of the original entertained. For me, the highlight of series 1 was episode 4. Several different storylines and action going on everywhere, all culminating in a very satisfying conclusion. Keeping up with the rapid pace and action of sci fi shows today, these events would have taken 3 episodes to unfold in the old series. I also think that nearly all the characters here feature enough mystery to keep you guessing as to how they will act next, which is a more dramatic portrayal over some of the low-key original characters.I was a tad disappointed in how series 2 turned into more of a continually running plot line than some of the more individualized series 1 episodes. I always like TV seasons better when they feature individual primary stories, than one spread out over a whole season. Luckily, the performances and gritty portrayal of life and survival after a catastrophic disaster make this season fulfilling nonetheless.Trivia: The original series was created by the late Terry Nation, who was also responsible for Blake's 7 and the Daleks from Dr. Who.

I've never purchased an Ultra anything CD, partly because of the commercial feel of them, with many current trance anthems thrown in with junk fillers. They don't even tell you who mixed them on the CD notes. I've heard them as friends of mine had them, but nothing ever motivated me to purchase one. I finally broke down and bought Ultra Trance: 4 (which Amazon incorrectly lists as Ultra Trance 04 -- there is no zero in front of the four anywhere on the CD packaging).I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of great trance, with some commercial bangers in there with great, not so easy to find, hard Euro trance. Disc 1 is your mainstream, commercial trance, with some of the past years dance floor and dance radio smashes, including tracks by Plummet, Angel City, Paul Van Dyk, Motorcycle, and Ferry Corsten. Disc 2 brings in some lesser known tracks which were not found on many other US trance cd's like lots of tracks on Disc 1 are. I have a lot of them already from getting some great import CD's, but it's nice to have them all here on a US release.Disc 1 does have some flubs, with the awful O-Zone track, a bad Bon Jovi remake, and my least favorite 4 strings release to date, Turn it Around. The only two things I can fault on Disc 2 is that Obsession by Tiesto is getting on in age now, and they could have included a more current track of his, or of somebody else; and Age of Love has had too many remixes lately, and after hearing Tony De Vit's previously unavailable remix of it, on his Are You All Ready compilation CD released last year, all other Age of Love remixes pale in comparison.With only 12 tracks per disc, you are getting a lot of longer mixes, however they do chop a few songs up, most notably, arguably the best track on Disc 2, I Found You by Interstate, only gets a measly 3 minutes plus.One other note, I am not sure if most people know, but Jes is on here 3 times! She is the singer from Motorcycle, and she also sings Deepsky's Talk Like a Stranger, and D:Fuse's Living the Dream. I believe these 3 tracks and her other song with D: Fuse Everything With You, are her only 4 tracks to date, but I can't wait for more.

It's your typical Fat Albert episode, gone Christmas themed. The always looking to do good gang is facing the demolition of their clubhouse, and a friend's father has lost his job, leaving his family homeless for Christmas. It's up to Fat Albert to save the holiday for everyone, and to do it, he needs to show the grinchy Tightwad Tyrone the spirit of Christmas. I won't spoil the end, so you'll have to buy it and see!You get one 1/2 hour episode (or 23 minutes) and one game, which is find out which snowman Fat Albert is hiding behind. It's a simple game, but my son kept wanting to play it over and over. The colors are very bright and the DVD quality is excellent. I think it would have been nice to have both this one and the Halloween episode on 1 DVD. Either way, I would purchase this one from Amazon, as I have never seen it sold in any local stores. A great find for the Fat Albert fan.

This is another enjoyable DVD for any young children who enjoy the Thomas shows or playing with Thomas wooden or plastic train sets. It has 6 short episodes to keep it just over 30 minutes, which is much better than those 90 or 2 hour ones that are simply way too long for little ones to sit through. Also, there are two spooky episodes just in time for Halloween, one is Percy and the Haunted Mine, which is doesn't deal directly with Halloween, but has it's share of spooky night scenery, and the Scaredy Engines episode which follows, that is about Halloween. You get the usual extras with a few games and sing-alongs. Check out Thomas' Snowy Surprise for the Christmas themed episodes.

While Peter Cottontail is certainly an excellent Rankin/Bass special, the one Animagic all Easter special (Peter Cottontail touched on all holidays and the First Easter Rabbit was cel animation) and the most popular when I was growing up was this one. While Peter Cottontail came out some years earlier, once this one appeared in 1977, it became THE perennial Easter special of the late 70's and early 80's. With it's cute lead character, Sunny, with the goofy voice, big Gadzooks, lots of colorful eggs, and the Fred Astaire character from Santa Claus is Coming to Town, this is one attention grabbing magical animation like only Rankin and Bass could have made.For all of us who loved Santa Claus is Coming to Town, this one was very similar in it's story of the characters from their beginnings to the start of each holiday. It was a can't miss special back then, and it should get the DVD release it finally deserves for all the new kids to see this magical story in stunning Animagic! Just as it followed Here Comes Peter Cottontail when it was originally released, The Easter Bunny finally rolls into DVD town, a questionable 4 years after Peter!!

Having barely seen an episode or two on PBS in my youth, I really got into the series after seeing the 1997 US TV movie. I quickly snatched up every VHS tape, and found every other missing episode and unreleased story on bootleg videos, to obsessively have every inch of existing Doctor Who known to man. I preferred Jon Pertwee's Doc the best, with Troughton and T. Baker next. No need to get into the original classic series, so on with the new one.Right from the start, I really enjoy Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor. It seems he really did his homework and seems to have found just the right combination of wit and intellect that made so many previous doctors a success. His quick tongue seems to keep up to the fast new pace of the show. While the longer episode, vintage shows had more time for character development and interaction, in today's fast paced world of 32x fast forward speed DVD capability, you can't have 4 to 6 part episodes and expect to keep people's attention to that one storyline. It worked in the 70's, but certainly wouldn't work now.Vintage Doctor Who always had great supporting casts and guest stars, and the new series is no different. Rose's boyfriend and mom keep up nicely to the pace and plotting of the show. Simon Callow gives a great performance as Charles Dickens in the series 3rd episode.Episode 1, Rose, sweeps us back into the whirlwind world of Doctor Who that we all know and love. It seems like it nearly skipped a beat since 1989, with only the surroundings and special effects being updated. It also offers enough info to keep a new viewer interested. 'Rose' is very action packed, much more than most vintage Who stories, and I think it has to be in some way to cater to the thrill-a-minute new millenium that we are all now fully accustomed to.I had seen some sneak preview photos of the Autons before the show aired, and I thought they looked a little awkward and feared they might come across a bit cheesy in live action, however they threw me for a loop after watching Rose, as they looked incredibly lifelike and menacing. Bravo for the special effects wizards who worked on them as they looked brilliant. A superb opening episode to bring us all back into Who!Ep. 2 kept Eccleston's sharp tongue going, and flew us into an alien space station, complete with just about every new concoction of an alien species one can concoct. Actually, the oddest looking species was the human!! A murderous metallic set of spiders is unleashed on a group of interplanetary oglers, wanting to witness the last moments of Earth. The always fashionably-late-in-saving-the-day Doctor has to come to Rose and everyone else's rescue.Ep. 3 takes us to familiar Who territory, a period piece on planet Earth. 1869 to be exact, and Charles Dickens is giving a Christmas Eve performance of A Christmas Carol that gets rudely interrupted by a gas powered, walking corpse. The sets and costumes are superb, and this 19th century Cardiff set story is a real treat.Episodes 4 & 5 are the first two part storyline, which deals with the Slitheen aliens invading Parliament. It features some hilarious moments when the Slitheen attempt to wear their "rubber suits" that impersonate humans.Ep. 6 is what we've all been waiting for: The Dalek episode. But alas, it features only one, but that's all it takes for a very strong episode involving an American collector of the future, who happens to have found one remaining Dalek, but doesn't realize how dangerous it really is. The Doctor, fully aware of Dalek aggression, has to step in and set things straight, with a little help from Rose.Ep. 7, The Long Game, takes us into a satellite space station where people are not returning from certain floors of the station.Ep. 8, one of the strongest and certainly the most emotional of the series, sees Rose wanting the Doctor to allow her to see the father she never knew, however she does something the Doctor would never do, and specifically asks her not to do: interferes with time.Episodes 9 & 10 is another two parter involves the Doctor and Rose in the middle of bomb ridden London circa 1941. Captain Jack Harkness is introduced and becomes a rival hero character for the Doctor.Ep. 11 involves the return of the Slitheen and their plan to destory Earth.Ep. 12 features a great spoof of reality shows, with the Doctor stuck in the middle. This episode also features the best cliffhanger of the new show: Rose is kidnapped by the Daleks and the Doctor defiantly proclaims "I'm gonna blow every last stinkin' one of ya out of the sky". Something no previous doctor would have ever said, it's a now classic quote and very characteristic of the new Who era, and the new Doctor.Episode 13, the final battle with the Daleks, is the culmination of startling sci-fi entertainment, and a fine arguement for being the best season in the show's long and storied history. It extremely disappointing that Eccleston is not returning for Season 2. That is a shame, because his Doctor is extremely well played. Hopefully David Tennant can fill his shoes nicely, and I'm sure the writing will be just as strong as series 1.These are going to be loaded with all the extras found in the UK release. They initially released bare bones DVD's on Region 2, in 4 volumes, which is how I got them as I had to have each new Who right away, and I can't wait until May 1st, when I will have the first of season 2 in my hands!! For now, US fans unable to play or get a hold of Region 2 discs, have the Sci-Fi Channel airings and this new set out in July!!

Take it from Brain and pick up the hippest slice of cartoon nostalgia you can find! First appearing in a far too short run in 1961, Top Cat would make two other appearances in the 80's: with the whole gang in the full length movie Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats, and by himself in Yogi's Treasure Hunt. Arnold Stang was the voice for all of them.I think two main appeals of this show that had me running to my TV set in the 70's (when it ran in syndication) were the catchy theme song, and the stunning animation. I can't imagine what a kid watching it on a color TV in 1961 must have thought. Even today, the striking color of the show should catch the attention of any kid. It was also fun watching this bunch of rag tag cats trying to reside in their alley, and having to hide from Officer Dibble because of their constant flim flam exploits. The attitudes of each cat can be attributed to the expertise of all the voice over actors involved. This one had a large cast, and all of them were spot-on.Top Cat, a.k.a. Boss Cat in the UK and Don Gato in Mexico, will live on, treating each new generation of kids (and adults) to the most illustrious colors and colorful cats in cartoon history.

Disc 1 is superb, with ATB's knack for fine track selections and awesome sounding trance mixes. One reviewer writes that the transition into Castles in the Sky is not smooth, well I ask you if you even know how to mix? This is one of my favorite transitions on the CD, with the thumpin' bongos mixed right into the pumping sythns that chime the start of Castles in the Sky. It's right on the money, and very difficult to mix it that way. Bravo ATB! There are plenty of classic tracks on here, with Delerium's Innocente (with some sweet vocals) and the nice ATB mix of Nino Lopez Project's Experience. One superb standout is Plummet's Damaged. This one still gets airplay on the radio today (just heard it last week) and is a timeless vocal trance track.On the other hand, while George Acosta's mixing is superb, the track selections are a little dated and not as fun as the first disc. Still a good listen and I would no doubt drop the dough on this smooth flowing mix of extraordinary trance. Most of the Ministry Compilations DO NOT have as many cool tracks as this does. Definitely in the top 5 MOS trance comp's ever, along with Ferry Corsten's Trance Nation's and ATB's Clubber's Guide to Trance (which is hands down number 1).

That quote was Arthur Daley reassuring Terry McCann that the minding business is still for him. Minder, one of the best British shows in their tv history, has not had a region 1 release to date, so I am not sure why it is even listed here numerous times on Amazon, even though they all say "unavailable". Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, and George Cole as Arthur Daley were teamed up for 7 seasons from 1979-1987. It ran from 1979-1985 for series 1-6, and then had 3 years off before resuming one final year with McCann, on season 7. Seasons 8-10 resumed with Arthur's nephew, played by Gary Webster, taking over for Terry McCann, but the chemistry of Waterman and Cole were what made this show such a phenomenon. The later years, while receiving good reviews, could never be the same without Terry on the job.Seasons 1 & 2 didn't receive high ratings on TV, and it wasn't until series 3 that the show finally became a hit. They even went back and replayed seasons 1 & 2 after series 3 went over so well. Aside from a few dull early episodes in Season 1, the rest of the episodes through season 6 were solid entertainment. Most episodes revolved around Arthur finding some nearly crooked job for him and Terry to make a nice little earner, only for him to take most of the prize money in the end, citing expenses, overhead, and other reasons to con Terry out of his share. Terry did get back at Arthur in several episodes, and more than once our lovable rogue con man ended up on the losing side of a profit.Terry McCann was an ex-boxer and ex-con, two reasons to make him the best minder, or bodyguard, in London. He often squared off against the right hand men and much-bigger-than-he hired hands of London underworld's most crooked citizens. Of course, he would always find the time to romance the leading ladies who were tied up in his latest job. Arthur's earners had Terry doing everything from minding Arab millionare's to minding women's dresses.The comedic antics of George Cole really made him a legend of British TV. Everyone during those years, and even now, knew who Arthur Daley was. Arthur and Terry usually hung out at the Winchester Club, run by Arthur's old mate, Dave, but Dave hated it when Arthur would bring his business inside and rough up his club. Dave was the only other regular character in Minder, besides Terry and Arthur. There were also the minor characters of Des, Terry's car thief friend, the on-the-take Inspector Rycott, and the righteous Inspector Chisolm, who all made numerous appearances in the show.There were two Region 2 Specials released on DVD, along with the movie, Minder on the Orient Express. Seasons 1-10 are out on Region 2 DVD, and if you can find the now out of print Region 4 DVD's from Australia, they made seasons 1-3, but featured uncut episodes with their original ad break captions, and on seasons 1 & 3, you got none other than George Cole featured on some audio commentary. The British Region 2 dvd's are very short on extras. I am not sure it will ever get a region 1 release, so you may have to seek out the foreign discs, if you have the capability to play them. If you do, you will reap the rewards of getting to see arguably one of the best British tv shows of all time.

My daughter loves this season, as Michelle is spewing out funny comments and talking more than any of the other 3. One thing I have a problem with watching this set is the poor transfer quailty of some of the episodes. The picture is nowhere near sharp, and looks like watching an old television with an antenna, where the outline of people is double. It's even worse the VHS quality, because at least that is sharp. Some episodes are worse than others, such as the one where Joey does the show with Frankie Avalon, which is horrible. This episode just aired on ABC Family this week, and it was crystal clear, so I am not sure what happened with the DVD transfers. And then the very next show after that one is fine, so it's not consistent. The packaging seems to get smaller each season, so maybe they cut costs on offering a high quality transfer as well. However, season 5 does not seem to have this problem.It's a good season, as the kids are a little older, and all actor's have settled into their roles well. I think seasons 3 and 4 are the best of the series. Kid's will probably not notice the difference in picture quality on this 4th season, but it certainly annoyed me.

The USA received a very strange release timeline of this show on DVD. First, the two big screen films saw a double disc set release:Sweeney/Sweeney 2, which is now out of print. A very odd way to introduce US fans to the show, considering movie versions of TV shows always play slightly off key from the original shows. Then, a different company released only series 1, with no other series releases. When it went out of print, I thought for sure the rest of the seasons would never see the light of day. BFS apparently has the license now and is releasing all 4 seasons, so US fans can finally see the entire series.If you like the cockney rhyming slang of this 70's cop series, you may also like another British cult show which started in 1979 and ran through to the 90's, called Minder. It ran for 10 seasons, and so far, BFS is releasing seasons 1-3.Minder - Season One.

This is a compilation of Tyrone Davis's Columbia years, from '76 to '81, and while it's a good collection of songs (could there even be a bad collection of Davis songs??), if you want ALL 12 charting hits from his Columbia years, you have to get the UK import CDHow Sweet It Is: Columbia Hit Singles 1976-1981, which has all 12 of his hits that charted on the US R&B; charts. This compilation is missing All You Got, Can't Help But Say, and Be With Me. There is one more notable Columbia years compilation,The Best of Tyrone Davis: In the Moodbut it is now out of print, and also did not contain all 12 charting songs. The How Sweet it is compilation also features the most upbeat songs, as this and the In the Mood contain more ballads. The only notable song that comp does not include, which is found here and is an excellent song, is Let's Be Closer Together. I guess you can't have them all! And if you're looking for all his Dakar hits, look no further thanUltimate Tyrone Davis.

In case you haven't noticed, after years of the Thomas destinations, bridges, and tunnels being nearly entirely made of wood, a lot of the pieces to appear over the last 2 years have a ton of plastic on them. They are made of a very durable feel plastic, but the overall look still appears cheaper than the wooden stuff, but the price still isn't cheap!Rolf's Castle Bridge is a very nice looking piece, and it's only got one way through, so you don't have to worry about connecting something underneath it or over it. On one end is a swinging door, and on the other is a door that you raise and lower by turning a knob. It's very easy for kids to use and the castle theme is a good new look for the Thomas line, despite being outfitted in a lot of plastic.

When it's positioned in your layout, it makes a bright, orange underpass, but using it for it's intended purpose is a bit troublesome. The little gray cement barrels don't always fall down when you press the top, and it gets my kids frustrated that they have to bang it several times. Also, unless you position the cement truck in just the right minute position, you are not going to get the cement piece into the back of it, as it's an extremely fine fit. The gate arm is the same used on the toll booth bridge, and it's horrible. Most of the time, it doesn't work, and the rest of the time, you have to use extreme pressure with your finger (hard even for an adult) to get it to work. Forget about your kids having enough strength to press it. The 2 little cement barrels are pretty small, and bound to get lost, then this thing serves no purpose. But, like I said, it looks nice as a big, orange tunnel!

My son kept seeing the commercial for this on a Rescue Heroes DVD we had and he had to have it for Christmas. After getting tons of RH stuff from Santa and family members, this ship and his new Kenny Ride figure are his two favorite presents. He loves playing the commands, opening the two main hatches, flying the front of it around with Billy Blazes driving, and making the Megabot with the attached robot stand.It's very big, and Just think of how massive this looks from a kid's perspective! He even likes kneeling in the back when it's fully opened, and pretending he's riding in it. Back when I was a kid, the Star Wars Millenium Falcon was the ship everyone wanted, and that was big, but this topples even that! While he can't pick it up and fly it, he has no trouble sliding it around the floor.There are a few drawbacks: It's so big, I am the one who has to lug it up and down the stairs in the house. You have to take off the back wing assembly in order to open the rear hatch. Also, the green ramps that slide out, are difficult for him to place into their locking slits on his own. You need to apply pressure to the back door, to push it back slightly, in order for the ramps to lock into place.Other than that, he loves this toy, and likes using it as headquarters better than the Mountain Command Center. One of his favorite figures was CD Moon, so he also loved getting a second one, in a maroon space suit. My son loves space themed things, so that made him like it even more than just a Rescue Heroes toy! Highly recommended for the RH fan.

The cord length from the headset to the control is very long and can easily wrap around a child's neck. I am sure with today's technology, they could have done a wireless headset and handset.The toy itself it a great rendition of Bob's new friend on the show. It only goes back and forth with the remote, and randomly turns the tires for left and right movement, even though it would seem from the 4-way directional pad on the control that you would be able to turn it any 4 ways.Because I have an under 3 child in the house as well, I had to remove the headset/handset because of the cord hazard. I do not even feel comfortable with it around my older son, for fear of it getting around his own neck. Therefore, they play with it just as a toy on it's own, but the handlebars and wheel movement do not conincide, so it is a bit awkward. Also, the little mock headset that Scrambler is suppose to wear does not stay in place whatsoever.Overall, they should have had more safety in mind and tweaked a few things with it's movement, and this could have been an awesome toy.

Yes, I have finally decided that this CD beats Tiesto's mighty In Search of Sunrise 3, and takes top spot on my list of the best trance mix of all time. Like ISOS3, it is an incredible journey through melodic trance, and Ronski's track selection was incredible, as nearly all of them are genre defining examples of the best trance has to offer.Starting off with the incredible Markus Schulz Coldharbour Mix of Satellite, it quietly builds into a euphoric trance experience like no other. There isn't a better track in trance history I can think of to start off a DJ set. Brilliant move on Ronski's part, especially since nearly everyone was spinning the Above & Beyond Remix of this track at that time.As Satellite perks up, so does the rest of the CD, driving on through catchy melodies and a sprinkling of vocals, all mixed "classic" style, with turntables and a CD mixer. There aren't many mixes left these days that aren't done digitally through a computer.Ronski Speed is right at the top of my DJ list right now, as he always spins the hottest new trance in his radio mixes, has been the absolute best trance remixer of the past year, and even has some great tracks of his own up his sleeve. He has remixed incredible versions of Miro's By Your Side; Kyau vs. Albert's Not With You; Phoenixstar's the Example 60; Rusch & Murray's The Promise; AVB's Burned with Desire which is on this CD; Marksun & Brian's Gran Rey; and one of the best trance vocal tracks of all time, and my pick for the best vocal trance remix of all time (especially when you compare it to the mediocre original version -- what he did blows me away): DJ Tatana feat. Jael: Always on My Mind. Then there are his solid production efforts: Asarja (w/ Mirco de Govia); E.O.S., and 2Day.This is an absolute classic mix from a class act Trance DJ! Quite simply, you need to own this if you call yourself a trance fan.

This is a fine deep and minimal house mix that plays well from start to finish. While it isn't one of your more explosive mixes of the year, it's definitely easy on the ears and a nice, middle of the road mix. It never strays too far from your standard house and deep house tracks, or in other words, doesn't get much into the tech or electro territory that most mixes are full of these days. There's also not many vocal tracks on here. It does have it's share of top tunes like Dennis Ferrer's Transitions and Will Saul's Pause. It's a nice set of tracks that I maybe wouldn't recommend over some hotter mixes this year, but I would still recommend purchasing it eventually. I wasn't disappointed with this mix in the least.

Solid stuff from trance icon ATB! Nearly 3 months after this 2 disc set was released in ATB's home country, Germany, it gets a US release. Thankfully it even got a release here, as ATB DJ in the Mix 2, released in Germany a little over a year ago, never came out here. #1 was a 2 disc trance staple that I am sure most of you owned back then. He upped the ante each time, providing a near perfect track selection on 2, but the mixing in a few spots was a bit shaky. Here, he checks in with another stellar track line-up, and a much better mixing effort, to release the best of the DJ in the Mix series so far, and the best 2 disc trance mix this year.ATB picked some of the best vocal tracks in trance, along with some great instrumentals. Just to prove how good at selecting tracks he is, a lot of the ones he chose for this one, are just now coming out on other DJ mixes, even though this was released 3 months ago, and these tracks are still quite fresh.He starts the mix off with his excellent new male vocal track, Summer Rain. I never really liked Tiesto's UR and Without you Near, as male vocals tracks to me have to be really perfect to sound good, however they fit really well into the mix and don't mind listening through them. Disc 1 has some stunning instrumentals including Giuseppe Ottaviani's Linking People, Mark Norman's Touch Down, and my favorite on the disc, Jonas Steur's Silent Waves. Solarscape's Alive and Headstrong feat. Tiff Lacey's Close Your Eyes offer some superb female vocal trance.Disc 2's standouts include Mirco De Govia's Vital Spark; ATB's own remix of the track Fever by a new artist, Shifted Reality, that it appears he produced (listed as ATB music productions); the mostly forgotten original version of Luminary's Wasting, which I like much better than the Andy Moor mix everyone is using lately; and the Funabashi remix of Hiver and Hammer's Fusion.He really keeps proving that between his myriad of good artist albums, huge collection of hit singles, and 3 excellent 2 disc trance mixes, that it's hard to pick a better all around trance DJ than ATB.If you want the best single disc trance mix of the year thus far, which unfortunately hasn't gotten a US release, it's Monster Series Vol. 1/Germany, by Ronski Speed. It actually came out in late 2005 and it's a great mix. Other 2 disc trance mixes you should check out are SolarStone's Destinations, George Acosta's All Rights Reserved, Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise 5, and although I haven't heard it yet, with the track selection I have seen, it looks like Armin may give this one a run for it's money as best 2 disc mix of the year with State of Trance 2006. Check my review there when that one comes out.

You get two types of house mixes on this CD, and within each mix, you get a broad range of musical styles as well.Disc 1 has Yousef bringing the "light" funky and jazzy side of house together, along with some disco vibes. He starts off with the excellent male vocal track Find A Way and then gets into 2 eclectic, jazzy tracks, which feature horns, guitars, and even a saxophone! Back to some standard funky house, including his own awesome collaboration with Nic Fanciulli on the track I'm No Good. A stunning instrumental follows, with an ultra cool vocal track Go up next. The next two tracks are decent, but unfortunately after track 10, tracks 11-17 get into a very disco-like, old school house funk that I just can't get into. It gets into some really similar sounding disco vibes, and the mix never really recovers back to the sounds of the excellent first part of the mix.Disc 2 presents from the "dark" progressive side of house, courtesy of a thunderous mix by Behrouz. His first track is a decent male vocal track, just like Yousef's mix, but the similarities end there. The tone gets darker with track 2 and this truly sinister mix begins to really get going. You get a healthy dose of punishing beats, heavy percussion, dark tribal, latin sounds, soulful vocals, and even some trance with track 12. He rounds out the entire progressive spectrum into one very sweet mix. Lots of drums and bass to be found, and things go tribal nuts with one of the best tracks on either disc, Touch It by Jaimy.I liked the Tone Depth track Everything when I first heard it, but felt it was a little drawn out and plain. Behrouz may have been thinking along those same lines, as he added an Acapella that truly fits and brings this track together. The only real stale spot in his mix, is track 7, which I found to be rather boring. It's quickly forgotten as the pace and beats never stop until the final track. The track Esperanza features a devastating and seemingly never ending drum loop, that really peaks out this mix. A reworking of the 1990 house classic Another Sleepless Night adds a nice touch, and the mix ends on a real high note with some pounding drums in the track Manhattan.Overall, and incredible collection of nearly every style of house you can think of, and only let down by a real awkward sounding group of funky house tracks on the latter portion of Yousef's disc.Yousef's mix is solid with tracks 1-10, but 11-17 are a let down. Luckily you can just stop the mix, and it's better than having a one good track, two bad, one good pattern! The Behrouz mix is one not to be missed. Yousef's disc - 3 stars; Behrouz - 5 stars; averaging out to 4 stars. Definitely worth checking out.

I can't even fathom any of the decent reviews a film such as this has garnered. It's filmed in an ugly setting, with dull cinematography, muted colors, and the most unappealing cast of characters I've ever seen in any film, any genre. Maybe, die hard lovers of the extremely twisted side of indie horror cinema will find something here. I definitely did not. I've seen some of the most inept, artless, and pointless films of the 70's, 80's, and through to the present day, especially in the horror genre, and this is easily one of my all time worst watches.

The tracks on here all blend so well into the CD, all DJ mixes should just be 1 disc. In fact, my 3 top trance DJ mixes are all one cd's: Tiesto's ISOS3, Ronski Speed's Positive Ways 3, and this one. You just can't keep one's attention all the way through two CD's.This mix is a keeper and never sounds dated. The reviewer who said it's dated and cheesy, I wonder what the heck you could be listening to right now, because it must be bad, very bad trance. And saying it's Armin's worst and to get all his other CD's is actually just the opposite. While Armin is a top live mixer and his radio mixes I've heard have all been superb, his CD releases have been mediocre at best, and not ones to keep in your collection.This CD is one that you will want to just keep hitting play after it stops, all day long. The melodic trance just takes it to a whole other plateau. He raised the bar after this mix, to a height he could never reach again, nor can many others (exceptions: Ronski Speed and Tiesto).Simply put, if you love trance, this one has to be in your collection, as it's one of the top 3 trance CD's in the history of trance.

This is a very groovy and smoothly mixed, retro dance entry in the Back to Mine series, and in my opinion, one of the best I've heard yet. The tracks in this mix range from 1973 to 1985. They touch on late 70's disco and funk, and early to mid 80's italo disco.Interest in italo disco has peaked lately, with this R&ouml;yksopp mix, another retro mix calledHellboys, and a handful of new artists such as those featured onAfter Dark, who are creating new sounds molded from the past. R&ouml;yksopp has definitely touched all their Italo Disco bases, by including some of the most popular tracks of this early to mid 80's European genre: Mr. Flagio's Take A Chance, Valerie Dore's Get Closer, and Klein and M.B.O.'s Dirty Talk.They start out the mix with the kooky sounds of The Talking Heads; dive into some Italo and standard disco grooves; throw in only 2 tracks from this decade (one is their own track, Meatball, under the Emmanuel Splice alias); and finish with some turn taking between italo disco and some late 70's funk. It's a well rounded and perfect trip back in time through disco, funk, and all it's groovy origins.I want to also note that the back of the CD incorrectly numbers the tracks. Due to two tracks spliced together and taking up track spots 5 & 6, they did not give them each a number and list them both within track 5, so tracks 6-19 on the back of the CD are actually 7-20 on the disc itself.

The quality Australian EQ label has released their 11th in the Balance series, and it may very well be the best yet. It is certainly the most consistent line-up of tracks through both discs. Luke starts off with a few progressive house tracks early on, then takes us on a groovy journey through deep house on disc 1, and into some higher energy electro vibes for disc 2. There isn't a dull moment on either disc, even from the first listen. No warming up, no second listen to enjoy, this one hits you right from the start. Amazing melodic tracks on both discs, this is a true house gem. A must own mix this year.

This is 1 out of 3 Max & Ruby DVD's released thus far. This was the first, although I missed it last year, then there was Springtime, and most recently, Halloween. As usual with holiday themed children's DVD's, there is only one true episode about the holiday, with the rest barely having to do with the theme. That's ok though, as any episodes of Max & Ruby are perfect for kids, and there are 12 featured on here. My two love this show, and it's one that is perfect for boys or girls, as each has a main character to relate to. I also recommend getting some of the myriad of books to go along with the show.

This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way. This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix. I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off. Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.Two solid tech house tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas Schumacher's incredible track Rotor. The mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix. It's not bad, it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking. It's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a Depeche Mode track. This is the only other slight miss in the mix for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix. Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax.Overall, it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one, very sound, top to bottom mix. Do not miss picking this one up, as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year.
