So much has been written about Frank Herbert's "Dune" in the nearly 50 years since its publication that it's difficult for the modern reader to come at the novel with expectations that are even remotely realistic. As for readers like me -- I've probably read the book half a dozen times by now, if not more -- I'm sometimes not entirely sure what I think of it myself. At times, it can seem very pretentious to me, and there are occasions, when revisiting it, that the precious, overweening dialogue drives me straight up the wall. But when I return to it with an open mind, I re-experience what drove me through it on my first reading: The sense of awe, the marvel of it, the magnificence and ambition of its narrative."Dune" truly is an epic novel, not just because it's more than 500 pages long. It's the scope of the book that resonates with readers, I think -- this is a "science fiction" novel that's also about religion, mysticism, race memory, politics, ecology, warfare and diplomacy. It's a huge book, but it doesn't wander, nor does it get mired down in its many themes.Thankfully, the story is strong, which keeps the book moving. Paul Atreides may or may not be the new messiah, the young man who, according to prophecy, will lead the Fremen of Arrakis to dominate the known Universe. His father, Duke Leto Atreides, is murdered by the Harkonnens -- royal cousins, yes, but also sworn enemies of House Atreides. It falls to Paul to explore the potential of the desert-dwelling Fremen, even as he begins to experience his own powers of prescience and considerable gifts for leadership. Long oppressed by the Harkonnens, the Fremen are only too glad to accept a young leader willing to upend not just the politics of the planet, but of all humanity.Herbert's storytelling genius was matched by his larger vision. Clearly, water-starved Arrakis is a metaphor for our own world's dependance on oil. But it turns out that "Dune" was literally about water, too -- that is, Herbert realized when he was writing it that water would become, over time, an increasingly precious substance. All you have to do these days to realize he was right is pay attention to the news -- news of droughts, yes, but also water rights being bought up by companies looking to profit at a situation some in our culture see as increasingly alarming."Dune's" other great theme -- and warning -- is its exploration at the apparently universal human desire for a messiah-like figure to emerge and provide hope, wisdom and guidance. As "Dune" reveals, such a desire has its dark side. Paul Atreides transformation into Paul-Maud'dib comes with a terrible price, both to himself and, ultimately, to his people.Fiction writers are supposed to create worlds in which we can immerse ourselves, worlds that seem as real as our own, at least while we are turning those pages. Science fiction writers, especially, have the task of creating entire alternate worlds that nevertheless seem believable, even plausible. While some of the science in "Dune" is rather "soft" compared with other novels in the genre, it really doesn't matter. After all these readings, I'm still not exactly sure how, for example, a Guild Heighliner achieves faster-than-light speed, except that it "folds" space, and requires a navigator who has at least some ability to see into the future. Beyond that, Herbert doesn't offer much in the way of explanation. No worries; you'll be carried along by the author's enthusiastic narrative drive.

"A Clockwork Orange" could have been the movie in the Stanley Kubrick canon known only as the film that followed "2001: A Space Odyssey." Released in 1971, three years after that masterpiece, "Clockwork" faced the peril of comparison with what has become the greatest cinematic achievement of all time. In short, how could Kubrick follow "2001," a film that was so incredibly good that one could not imagine a worthy successor?He did it by making a film so different from its predecessor that any comparisons simply fall apart. "A Clockwork Orange" is its own animal -- and "animal" it is, indeed. Whereas "2001" was about the exploration of space but also the exploration of humankind's capacity for change, "Clockwork" was the at-times painful study of a young man caught between violent individualism and repressive society.Malcolm McDowell is brilliant as Alex, the young "droog" who's ever on the prowl for deviant sex, "ultraviolence" and, seemingly, all manner of wickedness for its own sake. The character's relentlessly immoral (or amoral?) behavior stunned audiences at the time. The violent scenes -- of various victims being raped, beaten, kicked, murdered -- proved that, in 1971 at least, people had not yet become inured to extreme depictions of violence. Some of the film's detractors called it sick. In UK, there was a considerable amount of copycat behavior, which so unnerved director Kubrick that he had the film pulled from distribution there -- for quite a number of years.In between those two extremes -- those who would condemn the film, and those who seemingly condoned it by acting it out -- was an audience that pondered the dilemma posed by Kubrick: Which is worse? An insistence upon individual freedom, which allows for such horrible behavior, or a society that may be going too far in trying to cleanse the populace of such villainy?Alex, you see, is caught and subjected to a conditioning program that is supposed to make him incapable of committing any more crimes. But the effect of this behavior modification upon him is so drastic that he is effectively stripped of any free will at all.It's a diabolical film in part because it steadfastly refuses to provide any answers. Kubrick was a filmmaker, not a moralist, and so his audiences were left to decide, for themselves, which could be more cruel -- the solitary human heart, or the collective conscience that sometimes grows so harsh that it, too, seems hopelessly corrupted.This is a brilliant film. Do not see it, though, if you are easily offended. Upon its initial theatrical release, the film was one of a very few non-pornographic productions in those days to receive an X rating. Frankly, I've seen films far more graphically violent than this one that got tagged with an R, not an NC-17, the successor of the X. But it is true that there is something about this film -- something about Alex's gleefully nightmarish world -- that disturbs the mind like nothing else.

I've always enjoyed listening to this album, but that said, it's never been on my playlist as frequently as the albums that flank it chronologically -- "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "The Beatles," better known as "The White Album.""Sgt. Pepper's" was basically a summation of everything the Beatles as a band had learned how to do up to that point in their history. Vocally and instrumentally, it was challenging, and the sounds included sitar (played by George Harrison), brass and other elements that widened the group's sonic space. It had great songs like "A Day in the Life" and the title track."The Beatles," the white-clad double album that would follow "Mystery Tour," revealed that same band breaking off into their individual components. In short, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison often ended up working by themselves or with drummer Ringo Starr, each man developing his own compositions pretty much as he pleased. Again, the songs were very good, albeit more personal than the ones on "Pepper." Some of the best included "Dear Prudence," "Blackbird" and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps.""Mystery Tour" sounds closer to "Pepper" to me than does the White Album. I hear more group unity in songs such as "I Am the Walrus" and the title track, and of course on the group-composed instrumental "Flying." Still, the album shares a passion for quirkiness with the White Album -- and in fact the late John Lennon said "Mystery Tour" was his favorite Beatles record because it was "so weird."I agree it's odd, but it's weird in a very appealing way. And there are a couple of absolute classic Beatles songs here, including "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "The Fool on the Hill."If I were introducing someone to the Beatles, this would not be the first album I'd play for them, but it would be in the first half dozen. A very good effort from the Fab ones.

After all these years, "The Quiet Earth," if anything, seems more powerful than ever. I thought it was a terrific film when I first saw it, sometime in the early 1990s after stumbling across a VHS copy -- I'm almost sure I rented it from National Video, in fact. After finally acquiring it on DVD some years ago, I have watched it several times, and it never fails to make me marvel at the quality of the filmmaking and, more significantly, the mysteries of the universe and the very nature of what we call "reality."Zac Hobson is a scientist in New Zealand, one of a group that has been working with American scientists on some kind of secret project with military overtones. It's never entirely explained, but it seems to have something to do with energy fields and, more specifically, a power that can affect time and space itself.Hobson wakes one morning to find he's apparently the last human being on Earth. The scenes in which he reacts to this are masterful. We see him indulge in extreme narcissism, grandiose delusions, fits of despair. Mostly, what he finds out is that being the last man alive is a curse.Then he finds he's not alone after all. He first meets Joanne, a very attractive young woman, and they begin to forge a relationship. But Edens never last, do they? They soon meet Api, a huge Maori tribesman; Joanne is torn between the two men but seems to prefer Api's more intuitive acceptance of their changed world to Zac's ongoing preoccupation with the fear that something even worse is going to happen -- a more pronounced repeat of what Zac calls "The Effect" that apparently wiped out most of human life.Based on Zac's observations, the three of them decide to take action involving one of the facilities that was involved in creating the first Effect. Zac then deviates from the plan, resulting in ...... Resulting in one of the strangest, most beautiful, most enigmatic scenes I've ever witnessed in a motion picture. It is simply beyond anything I could have imagined for the conclusion of this film or any other, and it deserves to be seen without my telling you any more about it.I've discussed it with like-minded friends and we have kicked around many interpretations, none of which seems entirely satisfying. But that's the great thing about this film; like Stanley Kubrick's "2001," it forces you, the viewer, into taking at least some responsibility for assigning meaning to the proceedings.The DVD copy isn't easy to get these days, but I would recommend buying it from a third-party seller here on Amazon. You'll be glad you did. Meanwhile, I will keep hoping the powers that be will release it on a Blu-ray disc that can be played on U.S. machines. I'd love to see it in in high-def.Finally, I have to comment on the acting: All three principals deliver excellent performances. Bruno Lawrence as Hobson gets the most screen time, but Alison Routledge's Joanne and Pete Smith's Api are just as well-drawn and believable. Unfortunately, neither Routledge or Smith has worked in the last half-dozen years or so that I can see, and Lawrence died of lung cancer in 1995; he was just 54 years old."The Quiet Earth" is a must-see for any fan of thoughtful science fiction.

This is a review of the Blu-ray "Full Disclosure" edition of "Apocalypse Now"/"Apocalypse Now Redux"/"Hearts of Darkness."Finally, this film gets the treatment it deserves. Whether you prefer the original theatrical version (without the French plantation sequence) or "Apocalypse Now Redux," which included that sequence plus additional scenes, you'll really enjoy seeing them in high-definition with HD sound. The film transfers are just stunning -- no version of "Apocalypse Now" has ever looked like this.And, at long last, we get the inclusion of the documentary "Hearts of Darkness," which chronicles the making of the film and the extreme toll the long shoot took on director Francis Ford Coppola, his family, his star Martin Sheen, and others. At times, this look behind the scenes feels almost as harrowing as "Apocalypse Now" itself.I have bought many versions of this -- too many, probably. But I could not resist the opportunity to own this. It's worth every penny I paid for it.

I recall enjoying this very much when it was first released, but hadn't seen it for many years. It is wearing very nicely, thank you -- much better, actually, than I expected. Yes, it has its flaws, which I'll get to, but first, the strengths:1. Acting. It's first-rate throughout, with terrific performances by Alec Baldwin, Sean Connery, James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn and others. Even Tim Curry, who gets little screen time as the doctor, leaves a good impression. As for the debate over who made a better Jack Ryan, Baldwin or Harrison Ford in subsequent Tom Clancy-derived films, I think that's purely a matter of personal taste. I've seen several of the films and enjoy both actors' efforts.2. Story: It's gripping, to say the least! A Soviet submarine captain and his senior officers decide to defect, and, better yet, to hand over their nation's most advanced nuclear sub to "the enemy"? Terrific stuff! But is Connery, who portrays the captain, really to be trusted? That's the question, isn't it? And the stakes could not be higher.3. Sound and music: They really add to the drama here. That's true with many sub movies, including the classic "Das Boot." But there are several unforgettable scenes here, including the one with the Soviet sailors singing just before their boat seems to vanish from a nearby American sub's sonar capabilities.Now the cons:1. The visual effects: Well, time marches on, and these look awfully dated (the film was released in 1990). Still, for a two-decade old piece of cinema, these aren't bad. Remember that this was before the new wave of CGI, and give credit where it's due.2. Timing: The film was released just shortly AFTER Communist rule ended, leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Still, the movie did great box office, despite the unfortunate timing. Even though it's a Cold War movie (the opening crawl states it occurs in 1984, when the war was still very much on), it resonates in today's Age of Terror.3. The flipside of the casting: Much as I enjoyed Connery as the Soviet captain -- and Sam Neill as his executive officer, for that matter -- it's another film featuring Westerners in those roles.In the end, though, the criticisms amount to little more than nit-picking. I would put "The Hunt for Red October" on a very short list of the greatest submarine movies of all time, along with "Das Boot," "Crimson Tide," "U-571" and a couple older titles such as "Run Silent, Run Deep" and "The Enemy Below."

By the time of "Chicago VII" in 1974, Chicago had been, for the most part, written off by music critics. After all, the group had the gall to be a successful singles band in addition to its constant presence on FM radio. The gall! But Chicago also had great chops and some serious roots in jazz, as well as that pop sensibility, and they showed it all off on this album.True, "Chicago VII" does seem to have several personalities, but they're all interesting. On the original album, there wasn't a vocal to be found until the middle of side two. Instead, listeners got to hear a side of the band not on display, really, since the group's late-'60s debut, "Chicago Transit Authority." "VII" began with "Prelude to Aire," written by drummer Danny Seraphine, "Aire" (composed by Seraphine with trombonist James Pankow and flute/saxman Walt Parazaider) and "Devil's Sweet" (by Seraphine and Parazaider). The three instrumentals took up the whole of side one.Brazilian percussionist Laudir de Oliveira had played with Chicago as a hired gun on "Chicago VI," but on "VII" he seemed fully integrated into the music, and indeed would become a member on "Chicago VIII." His work here is amazing, and it seemed to energize a band in need of grappling with its popularity and expectations. "Prelude to Aire," "Aire" and "Devil's Sweet" were not for the singles fans of the group, nor were they for the critics, but rather for the band members themselves. And the commitment showed, from the brass section's various solos to Seraphine's percussive bebop explorations on "Sweet," which constituted some of the best drumming of his career.Side two began with two more instrumentals, "Italian From New York" and "Hanky Panky," both written by keyboardist Robert Lamm. The latter was a throwaway, and the rather somber phrasing of "Italian" was undermined by some annoying synthesizer. The side's third number, though, was "Life Saver," a classic slice of Lamm driven by his own pounding acoustic and electric pianos, plus a fine vocal turn that startles a bit, simply because by this point we've spent nearly half an hour without hearing the human voice. "Just when I found myself," Lamm sings, "back against the wall / you changed my life / with a telephone call." Overall, the song manages to sound gleeful and sinister at the same time -- not an easy feat! It's followed by "Happy Man," one of the more ghostly and underproduced songs by bassist Peter Cetera -- in other words, quite superior to some of the mindless ballads he would offer the band several years later.Side three opened with two numbers by James Pankow, "(I've Been) Searchin' So Long" and "Mongonucleosis." The second song was another instrumental toss-off, but "Searchin' " just soared on the choruses, and it would become one of the band's most enduring singles. The side closed with "Song of the Evergreens" and "Byblos," two of the most beautiful tunes ever written by Terry Kath, the vocalist/guitarist who would die of a self-inflicted gunshot in early 1978. "Evergreens" was sung, oddly enough, by trumpeter Lee Loughnane, perhaps because it was out of Terry's range? "Byblos" was low-key but powerful. It has always sounded best to me when played very late at night. "Byblos" is set in a music club, with Kath taking on the role of the man in charge; Kath sings about meeting a woman and maybe falling for her, only to see her slip away with a friend when he becomes distracted by someone who insists on doing some business that's never explained. It's a hugely affecting song, one of Kath's very best.Side four began with "Wishin' You Were Here." I've never been a big fan of Cetera's songs, but this was a monumental tune from the bassist/vocalist. Opening with sound of softly breaking waves, it features terrific vocals by Cetera and Kath, as well as help from several of the Beach Boys. It was followed by Loughnane's "Call On Me," written by the trumpeter but sung with gusto by Cetera.The album closed with two of Lamm's songs. "Woman Don't Want to Love Me" isn't one of his better efforts; I wouldn't go so far as to call it misogynist, but it's definitely smug, in my opinion. And soundwise, it hasn't worn well; in fact, it sounded dated even in the mid-'70s. That leaves us with "Skinny Boy," the album's closer, which also became the title track of a Lamm solo album. The difference between the two versions? The solo rendering just stripped off the Chicago horns, leaving intact the backup vocals from the Pointer Sisters. As might be expected, it works much better as a Chicago track. In addition to the snappy bite of the horns, the Chicago version is about 30 or 40 seconds longer, and in the extended coda, Lamm's keyboards end the track with what seems to be a kind of musical question, as if searching for some kind of elusive resolution.All in all, it's a brave, impressive album, even if it isn't really one cohesive musical statement. According to most accounts, the band was intent on making a jazz album, but Cetera and producer James William Guercio were worried that such an effort would be commercial suicide, so the more poppy tracks the band had been toying with were tossed into the mix. The result may not have been deliberate or particularly well thought-out, but "Chicago VII" still ended up being something like a slightly rough diamond, showing many facets despite its minor flaws. It remains one of my favorites.

The mid-1970s was a tremendous era for movies, with youngish film directors able to make bold personal statements thanks to a studio system that was not nearly as rigid as in previous generations. Unfortunately, that time would not last, but the result is that today we enjoy a time in which a very healthy "indie" environment helps shape popular tastes.I spent a lot of time in movie theaters back then, watching what in retrospect amounts to blockbuster after blockbuster -- "Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," the first "Rocky" (which, people might forget, was a superb film) and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."I was 14 when it came out, and had not even read Ken Kesey's novel yet. I went to see it, and was so moved I went back and saw it next week. After that, I read the book. After that, I read Kesey's "Sometimes a Great Notion." For awhile back then, Ken Kesey was my fictive universe.I've recently revisited all that stuff, and also viewed Paul Newman's adaptation of "Notion," which isn't easy to find. (I think I rented it on Netflix.)One of the differences between mere entertainment and true art is that art not only holds up but seems to deepen over time. And Milos Forman's film adaptation of "Cuckoo's Nest" has done just that. The movie basically swept the Academy Awards the year after its release, but come on ... is it really that good?Acting: Check. Not only Oscar winners Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched and Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy, but the entire cast, which included William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny De Vito and Christopher Lloyd.Directing: Check. Forman had directed nine films prior to this one, but was still relatively unknown. I think it could be argued that his helming of "Nest" was a turning point in his career -- he would go on, after this, to direct "Ragtime," "Amadeus," "The People Vs. Larry Flynt," "Man on the Moon" and "The Ghost of Munich." His Academy Award for best director of "Nest" was well-deserved.Adapted screenplay: Check, with some reservations. Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben did make some changes that did not sit well with fans of Kesey's novel, including, apparently, the author himself. One common complaint was that the focus shifted from Chief Bromden to McMurphy himself. I can see this point; Bromden narrated the book, and it is his voice and his evolution as a character that drives the book. But doing the film that way would've been very ... artificial. Bromden was, we'll recall, pretending to be a deaf mute to fool the staff at the mental hospital into basically leaving him alone. Framing the film that way would have required a voice-over, and in this case such a device would've just gotten in the way of the storytelling.Best Picutre: Was it? Here was the incredible competition that year: "Barry Lyndon," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Jaws" and "Nashville"!! Double exclamation point indeed! Rarely has there been a year with so many worthy BP nominations. ANY of these films would have been a worthy choice for best picture. I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, but I think "Cuckoo's Nest" was a better film than "Barry Lyndon." "Dog Day" was basically a thriller with several social messages, while "Jaws" and "Nashville" were probably the most purely entertaining. But "Cuckoo's Nest" won, and few could argue it was less worthy than the others.Bottom line: If you've never seen this film, DO SO. And if you can, get the two-disc version and watch all the extras. The story of this film is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. I won't spoil that story arc, but will just say it took a lot of time, effort and some false starts to get this fine film made.

"True Romance" is a true classic in many respects. For one thing, it's one of the best films directed by the late Tony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott. For another, it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best screenplays. But in the end, its greatest strength is the cast; so many people offer such fine performances that it's almost frightening.Chief among them is Christian Slater, who simply gives the performance of his life as pop-culture-geek-turned-coke-hustler Clarence Worley. Matching him for power and bravado is Patricia Arquette, who's always good but who's never been better than she is here. The supporting cast is, almost without exception, unforgettable: Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, Saul Rubinek as a sleazy filmmaker, Christopher Walken as a mobster, Gary Oldman as a pimp/drug dealer, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as cops, Michael Rapaport as Clarence's friend and aspiring actor, Dick -- and finally, Brad Pitt as Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate. Pitt is brilliant, offering comic relief to the film's hail of bullets and shotgun blasts.Scott's direction is as sure and scary as the roller coasters featured in one segment of the film. One minute you're giddy with laughter, watching the proceedings here, and the next, you feel like you're careening downhill at 90 mph.Yes, the film is a thriller, but it's a thriller with considerable mind and heart. Intellectually, it goes far beyond most genre material, actually daring to ask questions such as, "What constitutes true happiness?" Is it money? Career success? Or does love really conquer all? And the heart of the film is, indeed, the subject of love itself. How far would you go for someone you loved passionately? Would you break the law? Would you kill for them? Would you die for them?This is also a film you can watch over and over again. There are some great lines that beg to be heard more than once, and some visual moments that are no less than overwhelming, including the final shoot-out, which is as violent and crazed as anything ever put on the big screen by Sam Peckinpah.

"Chicago XI" was the band's last great album, the last with producer James William Guercio, and the last featuring singer/songwriter/guitarist Terry Kath, who died of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot wound just a few months after the album's release in late 1977.Remarkable, too, is that "XI" was such a strong follow-up to "Chicago X," easily one of the weakest discs in the Chicago discography.Kath wrote and sang "Mississippi Delta City Blues," the album's tough, scrappy opening song, which he'd actually written five years before, in 1972. It's not a retread, though -- it seems the band was just waiting for the proper moment to deploy it. Next up was bassist Peter Cetera's "Baby, What a Big Surprise," a somewhat Beatlesque number that was among his most appealing chart singles. Trombonist James Pankow's "Till the End of Time" wasn't a bad song, but he never should have sung it. The fourth song was keyboardist Robert Lamm's understated "Policeman," on which the very political and formerly rabble-rousing Lamm expressed compassion and empathy for a man beaten down but not defeated by the depressing nature of his job. Side One (sorry; old vinyl guy here) closed with "Take Me Back to Chicago," written by drummer Danny Seraphine with occasional Chicago session musician David "Hawk" Wolinski. Lamm sang it beautifully; Seraphine had based it on the death of a friend who'd been overwhelmed by the southern California lifestyle.Side Two opened with Lamm's impish "Vote For Me," a send-up of every hollow promise ever made by politicians interested only in getting elected (and featuring a tasty baritone sax part by Chicago woodwind king Walt Parazaider). It was followed by "Takin' It On Uptown," a song Kath wrote with Fred Kagan; there are no horns on it, and indeed, some have speculated Kath may be the only band member who actually plays on it, though it certainly sounds like Seraphine's drumming to me. Third on Side Two was trumpeter Lee Loughnane's "This Time," a bouncy, worthy successor to his "Call on Mee," which had appeared on "Chicago VII."The album closed with a mini-suite: "The Inner Struggles of a Man"/"Prelude: Little One"/"Little One," written by Seraphine and Wolinski except for "Struggles," written by Dominic Frontiere. Personally, I've always found this whole sequence pretty sappy, but as many Chicago fans have pointed out, Kath delivers marvelous vocals.And it was Kath's voice, in fact, that really made this album. He sang on four of the 11 songs, more than anyone else in the band, and his guitar playing was, as always, excellent. He dominated "Chicago XI," which made his death just a few months later all the harder for fans to take."Chicago XI" was the end of an era. The band never would sound this good again. Cetera would leave after a few more albums, and the band eventually fired Seraphine over issues of leadership and counter-accusations of poor musicianship. Worse, Chicago after this pandered more and more to the hit-single audience, at the expense of truly meaningful songs.Essential listening for any Chicago fan.

Of the nine studio albums Chicago recorded before the death of guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath, "Chicago X" is my least favorite. (If the numbers sound confusing, it's because the band's fourth album was a live set and "Chicago IX" was a greatest hits package.)"Chicago X" is the only one of those nine albums that does NOT feature at least one song I would deem "essential Chicago." On "Chicago Transit Authority," you had "Introduction." And right down the line: "25 or 6 to 4" from "Chicago II," "Free" from "III," "Dialogue" from "V," "Just You 'N' Me" from "VI," "Byblos" from "VII," "Harry Truman" from "VIII" and "Take Me Back to Chicago" from "XI."The closest thing to a keeper on "X" is probably Kath's "Hope for Love" or keyboardist Robert Lamm's history-of-the-band composition "Scrapbook." They're decent songs, but neither of them stands up to the best work from these two fine songwriters.And the rest of "X" is a downright embarrassment. Oh, performance-wise, the band still had its chops -- you can hear that in the opening horn statement on Kath's "Once Or Twice." But from a songwriting stance, this was the worst batch of songs Chicago ever had come up with for an album. To wit:Trombonist Jimmy Pankow's "You Are On My Mind" -- a forgettable love song, made wors by the fact that it was sung by its author, who in the past had contributed only background vocals, and for good reason: His voice is weak, his diction overly mannered, his delivery wooden."Skin Tight": Another Pankow song, this one awash in cliches and stupid sexual innuendo."If You Leave Me Now": The album's "slippery slope" ballad, composed by bassist Peter Cetera. A numbing dose of soft rock. Make that soft schlock; this was a huge hit single, but it may well be the most boring song of 1976."Together Again": A rare composition from trumpeter Lee Loughnane, who had done better with "Call on Me" from "Chicago VII" and would do better again with "This Time" on "Chicago XI." "Together Again" just was not remarkable in any way."Another Rainy Day in New York City": The usually dependable Lamm offers up this insipid ditty that tries but fails to evoke the energy of Manhattan -- which Lamm had achieved already anyway, on "Saturday in the Park.""Mama Mama": Another Cetera song opened side two of the vinyl album. I cannot listen to it; I hope I never, ever have to hear it again. I skip it on the rare occasions I play "Chicago X.""Scrapbook": This aforementioned Lamm composition boasts of Chicago's early association with Jimi Hendrix, who actually was a fan of Kath's playing, but somehow it works; it's an upbeat, kind of funky tune that acknowledges the band's long history."Gently I'll Wake You" and "You Get It Up": Two pieces of absolute drivel from Lamm (what was WRONG with him at the time this album was being written, anyway?), the first being a love song even gooier than Cetera at his worst and the second being a sex song even dumber and less subtle than "Skin Tight.""Hope For Love": At least the album ends on a fairly good note. "Hope For Love" is reminiscent of Kath's "Alma Mater" and "Till We Meet Again." All three songs have a feeling of summation, completion -- which explains why "Hope For Love" brought "X" to a merciful end," "Alma Mater" was the last song on "V," and "Till We Meet Again" closed out side one of the vinyl release of "Chicago VIII."If someone unfamiliar with Chicago asked me for a taste of the band, "Chicago X" is probably the album I would be least likely to recommend -- until, of course, you get to the ones recorded after Kath's death, which include the anemic "Hot Streets" and the hit factory "Chicago 16." Fortunately, Kath would have one last blast with the band, that being the altogether terrific "Chicago XI," which he dominated vocally.

Although sometimes overlooked, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella of dual identity ranks with Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and Bram Stoker's "Dracula" as one of the great horrific works of the 19th century. I first read it as a boy and I recently returned to it for the upteenth time -- and I'm in my early 50s now. This is one of those stories to which an appreciative reader can relish, over and over again.That said, I must warn anyone expecting a really good fright that our modern sensibilities probably prevent this book from having that effect. And in fact, "Jekyll and Hyde" was never as terrifying as "Frankenstein," the story of a man who presumes godly powers but creates a monster, or "Dracula," the tale of a creature who seems to have cheated death. Instead, this story of Dr. Henry Jekyll's transformation into a malformed thug is creepy, yes, but also quite sad.But that evocation of pathos may be the book's greatest strength. As a reader, I am repelled by Mr. Hyde but also feel a great pity for him, so twisted he is in body, mind and soul. Stevenson, able to create those conflicting emotions in his audience, stands as one of our great writers.I have read that some people reading this book for the first time have been disappointed by the experience, partly because of their own lofty expectations. If you're coming to the book anew, remember that it was written in a different time, long before we had become jaded by slasher films and pointless exercises in cruelty such as the "Saw" and "Hostel" series. This is a marvelous (and short!) tale of a man who lets his humanity slip away into the darkness. Highly recommended.

I find myself really surprised by the number of negative comments "3001" has received here, and I think some of those comments have been made without proper context and knowledge.Regarding the discontinuities between this book and its predecessors: Clarke always said the four books take place in slightly different realities. Thus, Poole's birthdate of 1996 here is fine, NOT idiotic or careless as some people have suggested. The author was publishing "3001" in 1997, and because it was very clear "2001" wasn't going to HAPPEN by 2001, he moved everything back a few decades. BIG DEAL. Get over it and roll with it -- it's science fiction anyway!Regarding the Monoliths being somehow diminished as the author treats them more as supercomputers and less as mystical objects: Again, what's the problem? Clarke wrote each of these books to explore certain themes; though connected, each volume stands on its own.Finally, regarding the absence here of Heywood Floyd and the apparently major discrepancy between this book and "2061": Again, get over it! Perhaps Heywood Floyd somehow separated himself from Dave and HAL during the centuries, or the Monolith did it somehow for some reason. Who knows? Who CARES?! I never thought having Floyd fuse with Dave and Hal in "2061" was such a hot idea anyhow.I do agree with some reviewers here that the ending seems a bit rushed. And overall, the tone of the book is less ... hmm ... majestic than the earlier ones. But it's anything but "sarcastic," as one reviewer said, and I don't find it at all sour, either, as others have suggested. The feeling of the book is vintage Clarke: Open, curious, wide-eyed with a sense of wonder at the marvels that may exist in the Universe. "3001" is a terrific read.

I recently have returned to listening to jazz after a long layoff in which I was exploring other genres, including electronic music. I'm now revisiting some of the big boxed sets in my collection, including "The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve," "Atlantic Jazz," "Miles Davis: The Columbia Years," and this set featuring Davis' work for Prestige."The Complete Prestige Recordings" impresses me now even more than when I first bought it a few years ago. One of its great strengths is that Miles during this time was playing very well and also exploring a lot of different material. Stylistically, it's a bit narrower than what he would do at Columbia, but depending on your point of view, that can be a good thing. In my case, I'm just not that big a fan anymore of Miles' "Bitches' Brew" period, nor some of the other Columbia-era albums that veered into what was once called "fusion," a term that now seems very quaint.All the material here is good; there's no question of that. But the heart of the set, for me, is Disc 3 and Disc 4. Just consider some of the songs on these two CDs: "Solar," "I'll Remember April," "Walkin' ", "Doxy," "Bags' Groove," "Bemsha Swing" and "Swing Spring." This is Miles Davis at ONE of the peaks in his long, varied career. And the rather astonishing thing about this period is that it was personally difficult for the trumpeter, who was struggling with -- among other things -- a heroin addiction.In fact, for most of the period that Davis was recording for Prestige, he was battling his own demons, including the aforementioned drug use and depression (the latter surely being produced in part by the former). Yet, as a player, this was a time of great progress for Davis. His sound became more "open" -- ironically as the trumpet itself was closed up as Davis started playing with a Harmon mute. Somehow, that thinner, more-focused sound allowed Davis to create the impression of greater dimensionality and expressiveness. His playing, always beautiful, now was becoming more tasteful and more distinctive.I highly recommend this set, expensive as it is, to anyone who believes as I do -- that Davis ranks with Parker, Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane as one of the greatest practitioners of the art of jazz.

I'm happy to say that the record company got this one right. The "Dark Side of the Moon" Immersion Box had horrible packaging; the result in my case was that I had to cobble together good discs from two different boxes, then return the box with bad discs to amazon. The solution for "Wish You Were Here": Put the four discs intended for those awful spindles in cardboard sleeves instead. My copy arrived in excellent condition.Now, on to the mixes here: In general? Phenomenal. But the blu-ray mix is the best of the lot, revealing details I'd never even imagined. I've always been told you could hear a few notes from the violin part that the Floyd asked Stephane Grappelli to record for the title track, but until this release, I'd tried and tried to pick up on it, to no avail. That is, I was never SURE what I was hearing -- was that really a fiddle wailing ever so softly under the blast of wind that ushers in the second half of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond"? Or just some high-end distortion? I definitely can hear the notes in this mix, though. AND the version without the wind drowning out Grappelli is offered here as a previously unreleased track. People may disagree with me on this, but I personally think the part he played didn't really fit well with the song. Nevertheless, it's nice to hear it both ways.Of even greater importance, though, is the blu-ray's presentation of the band throughout the album. Rick Wright's Mini-Moog work takes on much more depth here; you can hear the modulations much more clearly in the long, flowing passages of "Shine On." Bassist Roger Waters' vocals on that piece sound more exposed than ever, but that's a good thing -- doing the lead vocal on this may have wrecked his voice for awhile, but he's much more tuneful here than he is on some of he screechier parts of "The Wall" and "The Final Cut."There is a competitor to the blu-ray mix, though: I don't know why exactly they did it this way, but the surviving members of Pink Floyd have authorized Acoustic Sounds, a small company from Salina, Kansas, to press and distribute a 5.1 SACD version of "Wish You Were Here." I received mine today, and was able to listen and compare it to the blu-ray mix that's part of the Immersion Box. Somewhat predictably, perhaps, I thought the SACD's low end was superior; Nick Mason's timpani and the pulsating bass on "Welcome to the Machine" sounded fantastic. My judgment is that the highs are clearer on the blu-ray version. At any rate, if you own a player capable of SACD playback and want to save about $85, consider the SACD version; see acousticsounds.comAs for me, I'm beyond hope -- an unrepentant follower of the Floyd who has spent far too much money on the band over the last three decades. The first rock show I ever attended, though? Pink Floyd on its "Animals" tour. They blew me away then and they still do now.

"Wish You Were Here" is my favorite Pink Floyd album, edging out "Dark Side of the Moon." Musically and lyrically, both albums are very strong, but I have always thought the mixture of beauty, loss and melancholy of "Wish You Were Here," expressed so eloquently on "Shine On You Crazy Daimond," has stood the test of time a bit better than "Dark Side's" ruminations on greed, aging, warfare and the like.In the last few months, Pink Floyd has re-released this classic in not one, or even two, but THREE forms that all have their particular merits:1. The Immersion box version -- This is the version to get if you're just fanatical about all things Floyd. But lots of folks on amazon and elsewhere have complained about having to pay extra for stuff they don't want, including marbles, a scarf, coasters etc. I find that a somewhat absurd criticism; the box was MEANT to be lavish. More to the point, though, how's the 5.1 surround sound on the Immersion version? It's quite good, really -- as long as you play the Blu-Ray disc from the set and NOT the DVD, which is not true DVD-Audio but rather a DVD Video disc, with that format's inherent aural limitations.2. The vinyl reissue -- Of course it's not surround sound, but this version, remastered and released on 180-gram vinyl, is a beauty. Sadly, its predecessor, the "Dark Side" 180-gram re-release, was kind of a mess, pressed on vinyl that should have been waaaay quieter for the price. "Wish," by contrast, is superb -- very warm and inviting, and my copy had almost no detectable background noise.3. And of course this SACD version.Overall ... Well, the SACD version narrowly emerges, for me, as the best of the three. On my system and to my ears, at least, it offers the best overall sound balance, with slightly more emphasis in the lower register -- just listen to Nick Mason's timpani on "Welcome to the Machine"! Also, it's a lot less pricy than the Immersion box, yet the package is still lavish -- I love the new cover, and the mini-hardcover book packaging is sturdy but very attractive.It's wonderful to hear such a classic album from a fresh perspective. Enjoy!

"Paths of Glory" is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. It's also the first Stanley Kubrick film that truly can be called a masterpiece. Kubrick had begun with "Fear and Desire," but had withdrawn that film from circulation due to his embarrassment over it (although in autumn 2012 it is being released on DVD and Blu-ray). He followed that picture with "Killer's Kiss," a short but engaging piece of film noir about a boxer and a dancer. Then came "The Killing," a VERY good film about a racetrack heist.And then "Paths of Glory." This is the film in which Kubrick makes the transition to a great filmmaker from a merely good one. The plot, the pacing, the camera work, the acting by Kirk Douglas and a fine supporting cast -- every element was in place. World War I was an especially brutal war for soldiers, and Kubrick's shots of the trenches bring out the horror they must have faced.So what's the difference between this film and Kubrick's 1987 film, "Full Metal Jacket"? Chiefly, it's this: "Paths of Glory" is an anti-war film, whereas "Full Metal Jacket" is a war film. That is, "Paths" clearly is condemnatory, while "Full Metal Jacket" simply observes. Yet even "Jacket" has the power to horrify the viewer, being unsparing in its depiction of war.Hats off, too, to the Criterion Collection for giving us yet another beautiful restoration of an essential film.

In addition to all the other attributes of this release -- excellent restoration of picture and sound, great packaging etc. -- I must say BRAVO to the Criterion Collection for including, as bonus material, a print of Stanley Kubrick's "Killer's Kiss." A much slighter film, I had my doubts about whether it would ever get an upgraded release on its own; thus, this seems the perfect solution.As for "The Killing," this is just a marvelous Kubrick film, and one of his that I have come to appreciate even more, with the passage of time and subsequent viewings. The scene in which the money literally blows in the wind (I'm trying to be vague enough to avoid a spoiler here) is one of the most affecting scenes I've ever experienced in a film. And Sterling Hayden, who would go on to appear in Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove," is nothing less than brilliant from beginning to end."Killer's Kiss" was Kubrick's first effort at film noir, and it's certainly worth a look, but I'll put it this way: If you saw that film and didn't know it had been directed by Stanley Kubrick, I think you'd conclude it was good but not great (and in fact, I give it three stars out of five). But it is with "The Killing" that we catch the first real glimpses of Kubrick's signature style. Highly recommended!

The late Stanley Kubrick is my favorite filmmaker. His work has astonished and thrilled me since I was in my teens ... and it's been a LONG time since I've been in my teens. I revere his moviemaking skills above all others.Yet I can give "Killer's Kiss" only three stars. One of the drawbacks here is the story, which is nothing special: Boxer protects dancer from mobster. That's the narrative, in a nutshell.What makes "Killer's Kiss" special, though, transcends story. As with many Kubrick films that would follow this one, it isn't so much WHAT happens as it is HOW it happens, and how the characters react. So we get some great performances out of the actors; these people create their characters with very little material at hand, actually. And the atmosphere is PERFECT film noir -- dark, tense, anticipatory, with the mood underscored by the movie being shot in black and white.Best of all, not surprisingly, is Kubrick's visual style. The city of New York becomes, almost, a character itself in the film. The shadowy textures, the sense of isolation despite being surrounded by people, the urban but rather unwelcoming tone, all made for a visually interesting film.This isn't the place Kubrick newbies to begin; much better would be "Paths of Glory" or "Dr. Strangelove." But seasoned Kubrick viewers will appreciate "Killer's Kiss."

First, Tamiya makes good paint, whether it's spray paint or bottled, acrylic or enamel or lacquer or what have you. I've used several of the company's products and have not been disappointed.This polycarbonate "Smoke" paint is intended to be used on clear model car bodies, apparently -- and you paint from the inside? Don't ask me; I don't build model cars. But ship and aircraft modelers have found many uses for the "Smoke" paint, including, apparently, simulating oil discharges.As for me, I bought it to use as an overcoat for a big project I'm working on: Building Revell of Germany's 1/72 USS Gato submarine model. Instructions call for painting the lower part of the hull semi-gloss black, which I did by airbrushing Tamiya's brand of that. Afterward, though, I sprayed a light top coat of the Tamiya Smoke. It really, really brought out the details, which I was concerned about with this project because black paint tends to make things disappear.Again, all of Tamiya's products have been good to me, including this one. I have heard some complaints about this and other Tamiya paints running, but I didn't have that problem. Just go with light coats and be patient, building up color with successive coats if you have to do so.

This isn't a fancy instrument, but it doesn't need to be. The finish isn't outrageous, either; no one's going to "ooh" and "ahh" over this as if it's some nitrocellulose masterpiece. Again, doesn't matter. This is a working musician's lap steel guitar, and it doesn what it's supposed to do: wail when you put a tone bar to it.Electronics: I had a small problem with mine; a fitting came loose inside the volume control just a few days after I received it. To my great surprise, I was able to fix it in about two minutes! Yet another advantage of keeping things simple.Tone with this guitar largely is a function of amplification and effects. I play it through an old TubeDriver hundred-watt amp I've had forever, usually modifying the signal only with a Boss Bluesdriver pedal.An additional note: I play left-handed. I changed the strings around and had no problems. The only modification I had to make was to buy a cord with a flat-fitted jack so it wouldn't get in the way of my left hand.One of these days I'll move up to a Fender lap steel, if I ever decide to spend the money. For now, this is proving to be a durable and enjoyable instrument. I knocked off one star mostly for its appearance, which is very plain, and the aforementioned electronic problem.

Once upon a time, I owned a pair of Stax electrostatic headphones that pretty much blew away everyone who heard them -- including me, of course. The sound truly was phenomenal, but there were other things that weren't so great: For one thing, they were far from durable, and with me, "fragile" just hasn't ever been a good idea with headphones. For another, they required a separate driver unit, which was cumbersome. Finally, the ear cups were not comfortable at all. Still and all, I used those headphones for many years and was always knocked out by the open, powerful sound of them.They finally fell apart. Meanwhile, my interests had expanded to include a home studio. After being disappointed by lots of different phones, INCLUDING various models of Sennheiser and AKG, I found these, and I've never been happier.These are the only non-electrostatic phones that rival my old Stax cans. I love them in my home recording studio because they do not add or subtract ANYTHING from the music; I can play back whatever I'm working on in these or on my monitor speakers and feel I'm hearing essentially the same thing.Probably needless to say at this point, but hook them up to a good music receiver or amp/preamp combo, and the result is quite stunning -- the soundstage feels big enough, but there's an intimacy I enjoy, too. Recently, I've even been using them for movies if I'm up late and don't want to disturb my wife. Of course I'd prefer surround for watching films, but last week watched the Blu-ray version of "Apocalypse Now" and was thrilled with the results.In addition, the 770s are one of the most comfortable sets of phones I've ever owned.I've read some reviews accusing these phones of being boomy. In the end, the beauty of music is in the ear of the beholder, though, and I have never, ever perceived any boominess with these. Your mileage may vary, of course, but I would recommend these to anyone.

"Franny and Zooey" is J.D. Salinger's last great book. Published in 1961, it actually consists of two pieces, a longish short story dating from 1955 ("Franny") and a novella from 1957 ("Zooey"). This would be followed in 1963 by Salinger's last full-length work, "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction." That one was published in 1963, although "Raise High..." dates from 1955 and "Seymour" from 1959.It was with "Raise High...Seymour" that Salinger descended into writing so mannered that it began to feel stilted and stifling rather than liberating. "Raise High" is actually quite good, but "Seymour" is so self-conscious that it simply can't carry its own weight, although there are some fine moments in it."Franny and Zooey," on the other hand, displays the intellectual spark and superb writing that had distinguished Salinger's only novel, "The Catcher in the Rye," and his fiction collection "Nine Stories." The prose is nimble, the dialogue varies from hilarious to heartbreaking, and the setting is beautifully drawn, almost cinematic -- you can see the Glass's apartment in your mind's eye quite clearly as you read the two interlocking pieces."Franny" focuses on the youngest member of that family of prodigies, the Glasses. In the story, Franny basically has an emotional breakdown brought on by ... well, what is it, really? A spiritual epiphany? A spiritual crisis? A little of both. Essentially, she becomes obsessed with a prayer that has both Christian and Zen resonances. It also becomes evident that college life is not exactly turning out to be fulfilling for her."Zooey" chronicles the aftermath of that breakdown, as Franny retreats to the Glass apartment, where she is both comforted and challenged by the second-youngest of the Glass siblings, Zooey. Both these young adults must be geniuses -- but Zooey is simply off the charts; one wonders if his IQ truly could be measured. Zooey also seems to have come to grips with some of the spiritual ecstacy/angst that is besetting Franny.I never cease to marvel at this story, which I must have read a dozen times. Salinger has abandoned what most people would consider good rules of writing; the narrative has very little conventional drive, for example. There's a long description of Zooey taking a bath, and intertwined with that, a portrait of the Glass matriarch, Bessie, who comes off as more grounded but also more naive than her offspring. Salinger also doodles around with a letter Zooey is reading, which, it turns out, was penned by another Glass sibling, Buddy (J.D. Salinger's fictive alter ego).Despite its deliberate pace, though, the story never feels plodding or leaden; somehow, Salinger pulls you along, and if I could figure out how to make such a leisurely style so mesmerizing, I'd be writing novels and short stories instead of Amazon reviews.True, the Glass children can be a bit ... annoying. I mean, come on, is any one family REALLY this gifted? For the most part, though, there's a charm about them that can be almost radiant.The ending of "Franny and Zooey" is nothing less than magnificent -- humorous, poignant, lovely and thoughtful, all at once.This is terrific literature, almost deserving of a five-star rating -- but that would accord it the same stature as "The Catcher in the Rye," and the fact is that "Franny and Zooey" just misses being that good. I commend it to every reader who appreciates excellent characters and good detail and an idiosyncratic view of life.

So it's the mid-1970s, and because of their infernal and internal and eternal bickering, the chances of a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young reunion have collapsed again. What to do? Put Neil Young and Stephen Stills in a studio, with some of the best session musicians in the business, and even though David Crosby and Graham Nash aren't in the mix, you figure something good just might come out of this.And something did: The title track of the 1976 album, "Long May You Run." The song itself is incredible -- a jaunty melody, just the right touch of nostalgia, a beautiful chorus of backing vocals on the break. It's hard to believe, but true, that Young wrote the song about the loss of his Buick hearse, which he had nicknamed "Mort."'The whole premise of it is silly, really, but the song is vague enough it could be about relationships going bad (or well) Whether you "got" the lyrics or not, it was a powerfully effective, heartfelt song.Too bad the rest of the album is so forgettable.Oh, I suppose Young's "Midnight on the Bay" is pleasant enough, and his "Ocean Girl" works because of some lush backing vocals that recall CSNY at their best. And although they're certainly not credited, it sure sounds to me that Young is backed by his own band, Crazy Horse. Whether or not it's them, the song displays the kind of fundamental crunch they practically invented.What to say about Stephen Stills' contributions to this album. Well, "Make Love to You" is sexist and stupid -- and it was sexist and stupid back in 1976, too. Stills ruins "Black Coral" by producing the living daylights out of what was supposed to be a mysterious journey. And the closing track, Stills' "Guardian Angel"? So annoying that my wife asked me to just go ahead and turn it off.Frankly, Young has done much better than this in his solo career. Stills has not, and it's hard not to conclude that he's burned away much of his talent by pursuing, let's just say, non-musical pursuits.This album, with better songwriting and more of a commitment on Young and Stills' parts, could have been terrific. Instead, they produced one great song and eight pieces of mediocrity.

I admit I've been skeptical when it comes to people raving about the superiority of blu-ray audio. I, for one, was disappointed that neither DVD-A or SACD ever caught on, having found strengths in both formats. In short, I usually found DVD-Audio releases to be a bit glassy, and SACD actually a bit too heavy in the mid-range, but of course, in the end, it's the mix that makes or breaks a multi-channel release. The DVD-A release of Steely Dan's "Gaucho" is quite beautifully balanced, and the 2003 SACD of Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" was a revelation.I stumbled across the blu-ray audio version of "Damn the Torpedoes" while looking for King Crimson DVD-Audio releases. It's long been one of my favorite albums, so I bought it despite my doubts.I'm very glad I did. This version of "Torpedoes" absolutely blew me away. Ryan Ulyate's 5.1 mixes of the nine songs from the original album are respectful of the production work (by Petty and Jimmy Iovine) and engineering (Shelly Yakus). That is, you still get that gut-punch sound that made the album so exciting to hear. But without destroying the album's original power, Ulyate has managed to isolate the instruments. I hear things on the blu-ray release I never knew were there, and I must have listened to this album a couple hundred times over the last three decades.Everyone in the band benefits from the 5.1 format, but no one more than keyboardist Benmont Tench. His piano on "Shadow of a Doubt" sounds louder and higher in this mix, and the staccato riffs he pulls off as the song builds are just amazing. And on "Louisiana Rain," I was literally startled out of my seat by the harmonium. Tench's organ work with the band was frequently aggressive and well-mixed, but it's great to be able to hear his other parts here with this much bite.This version also includes nine bonus tracks. On most releases, such things end up being underwhelming -- usually, there was good reason certain songs were left off the album in question. Not the case here: Songs like "Surrender" and "Casa Dega" show that Petty was at a creative peak as a songwriter. There are also live versions of "Shadow of a Doubt" and "Don't Do Me Like That," plus a very worthy alternate take of "Refugee." Furthermore, the sonic landscape of the bonus tracks, whether live or studio, complement the album's original nine, so you can listen to the whole thing without feeling jarred. Everything here is bright without being brittle. The mid-range is clear, and the low end is nothing short of marvelous: It's powerful enough, but not boomy -- just listen to the crispness of Stan Lynch's kick drum on the intro to "Here Comes My Girl."This release is a beautiful rendering of one of the more important rock albums of the Seventies.

OK, let me get the bad-mouthing out of my system and then I'll move on to giving the movie its deserved due."Star Trek" (2009) is an absolute load of peanut butter when it comes to a coherent, believable story. I'll try to avoid spoilers while saying what I have to say, which is basically this: This whole idea of a supernova threatening the planet Romulus is absolute stupidity. Wherever this supernova was, it certainly was NOT Romulus' own sun. Given the vast distances between interstellar objects, and given the scientific abilities of the Romulans in the 24th century, THERE IS JUST NO WAY that the Romulan people would have been destroyed by this celestial event. They would have evacuated the planet, if nothing else, and would have had plenty of time to do so, even AFTER Spock's "red matter" solution (whatever the bleep THAT is) had failed. So the whole premise of the Romulan Nero being enraged by Spock's failure is quite simply ... ludicrous.ALL RIGHT ... all that amounts to mere nitpicking. "Star Trek" always has dabbled in suspect science; warp drive itself is an apparent violation (or evasion) of Einstein. What made the original series, and its sucessors, and most of the movies successful is the spirit of the whole enterprise (pun intended), including the strong characterizations of the crew. And that's where the 2009 reboot of "Star Trek" gets it right.First of all, the casting is impeccable. Not just Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock, but ALL the main characters. Karl Urban is just ornery enough as Dr. McCoy, Zoe Saldana absolutely sparkles as Uhura, John Cho captures Sulu's calm and good humor, Anton Yelchin plays up Chekhov's weirdness, and, best of all, Simon Pegg makes Scotty even more comically relieving than the original.The actors clearly like and respect one another, whereas in the original cast, there was some significant resentment on the part of some toward William Shatner. The result is a more ensemble feel which serves this film quite well.And the story, absurd as it is, does careen along at warp speed. The pace of the movie is, for the most part, breakneck, and you can't help being carried along by it.Finally, the special effects: They are, quite simply, the best in "Trek" history.In short, the movie won me over despite my considerable objections to the story. I do hope that the sequel makes a little more sense. Meanwhile, this first re-imagining is, if nothing else, a REALLY good time.

Shirley Jackson was one of America's great, great writers of fiction, and "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" is her bona fide masterpiece -- simply the finest thing she ever put on paper.I say this, by the way, as a great fan of "The Haunting of Hill House," Jackson's beautifully written ghost story. I also hold in high regard "The Lottery," which collects that short story and two dozen others, including the masterful "Charles" and "After You, My Dear Alphonse."But "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" is her masterwork because it works on every single level it attempts: It is, at once, a deep character study, a social commentary, a (quiet) thriller, and a novel that is seductively macabre without being supernatural."Castle" is a tale of two sisters and their elderly, infirm uncle. Merricat, the younger of the two sisters, is the only one who leaves the house, or, rather, the mansion -- the Blackwood mansion. Uncle Julian is too ill and Constance, the older sister, seems to be suffering from a combination of what we moderns would reductively label agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder. So the regular task of shopping for groceries and household needs falls to Merricat, who despises the errand.She despises it because the townspeople despise her and her family. Part of their hatred seems rooted in the Blackwood's wealth, but the other part of it has to do with the murders of several other members of the family, including the sisters' parents. Constance was charged with but acquitted of the killings. Despite that verdict, it is the townspeople's collective view that she got away with murder.In the end, though, it is not the plot of the novel that compells so deeply. It is the voice of Merricat, who serves as our narrator. She is, at 18, both diabolically intelligent and peevishly childish -- a girl-woman who seems to have little interest in growing up fully. Jackson's sure writing makes Merricat nothing less than indelible; after reading this book, you will feel this is someone you have met personally.The author herself died at age 48, which I always have thought was a terrible shame. Though she had been dealing with health problems, she was still writing, and I can't help wondering what other gems she would have completed had she lived a longer life.

... is very good. The main point is to give yourself time, and that's not an easy thing to do, but patience does win the day. Plus, there are so few books out there for younger widows and widowers. Well done.

"Shardik" must have seemed something of a shock to readers who had adored Adams' "Watership Down." The author's first book was thoroughly enjoyable and accessible, a modern fable that read like a magical adventure. "Shardik," by contrast, was epic fantasy, steeped deeply in philosophical questions, especially those concerning the nature of religion and the apparent need in the human soul for spirituality.I confess I have not read this novel as many times as I have read other books by Adams, especially "The Plague Dogs," which I would rank as my favorite. Yet there are tremendous rewards here for the patient reader. First of all, Adams' gift for language is as deft as ever. Second, the story itself is absolutely compelling.But in the end, "Shardik" emerges as a canny exploration of myth and an examination of our hunger for sacred meaning in life. This is not, in my view, the author's best book, but it is one of his most ambitious.

...this 40th anniversary remix of "Islands" does present the material in its best possible light. One of the standout tracks, "Ladies of the Road," is far, far raunchier than most of the King Crimson catalog, but at the time this record was released, the band desperately needed to show it still had some fire in its belly -- KC already had come close to disbanding more than once by the time "Islands" was recorded.Part of the problem with "Islands" and its predecessor, "Lizard," is that there's simply no overarching vision for the album; the musical styles wander all over the place, from rock to progressive to jazzy. For other groups, that's not a problem, but King Crimson always needed to sound unified, whether they were exploring the airy prog-rock textures of "In the Court of the Crimson King" or loud/louder dynamic of "Thrak."This release will be of most interest to listeners who can play back the DVD-Audio disc, on which Steven Wilson has remixed the sound for 5.1, so that each instrument can be heard more clearly. There's also a CD with just the stereo mix, but frankly, if I were not a DVD-A guy, I would've stuck with my 30th Anniversary version. Bottom line: There's reason to buy this if you're a multichannel listener and a Crimson completist.

"Player Piano" was Kurt Vonnegut's first novel, and it's a far cry from his later work, which made lavish use of humor -- including broad humor -- and unconventional narrative, including the crude drawings Vonnegut did himself for "Breakfast of Champions."The target of Vonnegut's displeasure -- and, thankfully for us, he was always displeased about something -- in "Player Piano" is the corporate/technological power structure, or what Eisenhower referred to as the "military-industrial complex." For the most part, the novel is very straightforward, compared with KV's other works. The style is more lyrical and, arguably, more literary (I'm not denigrating his later works when I write that).In fact, reading this novel, it's kind of hard to believe it was written by the same writer who penned "Cat's Cradle" and "Slapstick." As several commentators have pointed out, "Player Piano" has as much, perhaps even more, in common with Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" or George Orwell's "1984" than it does with some of Vonnegut's other novels.If you like this book, don't miss "Deer in the Works," a brilliant short story of Vonnegut's that appeared in his collection "Welcome to the Monkey House," but was written and published in the same time frame as "Player Piano," with which it shares several themes.

This is, far and away, my favorite Grateful Dead studio album. NEVER had the band sounded this focused, cohesive and energetic in the studio. From the songwriting to the arrangements to the performances, the band in 1975 had found a creative high point, and it's evident in every tune on this album.It's also clear that every band member enjoyed contributing. Rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, who was nearly booted from the band early on in part because it was felt he wasn't keeping up with the others improvisationally, plays his tail off here, and the mix allows the listener to hear him, whereas he was sometimes drowned out on previous Dead discs. Mickey Hart had returned to the Dead fold for this album after a hiatus related to his embarrassment over his father, a businessman who had, it was discovered, ripped off the band instead of enriching it. Easing his way back into the group, Hart didn't bring a full kit to the sessions, preferring instead to augment Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann with percussion accents (check out the sleigh bells on "Help on the Way"!). Vocalist Donna Godchaux is in great voice here, even though she has no lead vocal parts, except for a few lines on "The Music Never Stopped"; she supports the other singers throughout, though. Bassist Phil Lesh is at his creative best, interacting with the two drummers but also playing melodic figures in reaction to lead guitarist Jerry Garcia.And that leaves Garcia and keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who never sounded better together than they did on "Blues for Allah." In later years, Godchaux developed an aggravating musical tic, imitating phrases Garcia was playing instead of offering parts that complemented him. Here, though, their musical interplay is a true partnership -- just listen to how supple they sound on "Franklin's Tower."The Grateful Dead was always best when it had strong material, and the songs here -- even instrumentals like "King Solomon's Marbles" and "Sage and Spirit" -- absolutely burble and bubble with energy. The title track is probably the least accessible, with a decidedly Eastern modality and odd melodic line.I have listened to this album well over a hundred times in the last three or four years alone, and always find pleasure going back to it. Note on the expanded version: The additional six tracks are pretty much throwaways, with five of them being instrumentals labeled "grooves" and "jams." The exception is "Hollywood Cantata," a pleasant enough number sung by Weir -- but, given the quality of the other songs the band was writing at the time, it's clear why it was left off the original release.Even if you don't normally like the Dead, give "Blues for Allah" a try.

Roxy Music always has struck me as being a little ... chilly. I mean, the band has produced some great work, and Bryan Ferry's voice is lush and always inviting ... to a point. RM is art rock, and frankly, sometimes the emphasis has been too much on the art and not enough on the rock."Siren" has some excellent moments, and "Love Is the Drug" is one of the most revved-up tunes in the Roxy repertoire. This isn't my favorite Roxy Music album (I'm kind of torn between "Country Life" and "Stranded"), but it's definitely worth adding to the collection. Overall, this is a gorgeous disc, but in the end, what keeps it from being five stars for me is it's just too slick. Contrast that with a cut like "Mother of Pearl," which is also really polished, but has that eccentricity that Roxy showed when the band was at very best.

I'm glad I bought this album in its lavish reissued vinyl release. The record itself is 180-gram vinyl, and it's pretty darn satisfying to pull it out of the jacket and feel the weight of it, and the flatness, and the thick, blunt edge. I'm old enough to remember how record companies were issuing garbage in the 1970s, in terms of albums' physical quality (and sometimes in terms of the songs on them).So this reissue looks and sounds superb. The songs? Well, it's a pretty good grouping, led off by "The Thrill of It All," which in my opinion is one of the better songs Bryan Ferry ever wrote. Overall, the album is extremely well-recorded and well-played. This is a great disc to have in your collection, and a pretty representative one, given that it reflects the stylish, accomplished sound of early to mid-1970s rock.Oh, and the cover: Good to see it restored to the scantily-clad model version, simply because that was what Roxy wanted, and because censorship 1) sucks and 2) doesn't work anyway -- it just piques people's curiosity. :)

In a sense, I can't believe I'm giving this 10-CD set just four stars instead of five. Charlie Parker was one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, ranking with Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Duke Ellington when it comes to performance, innovation and influence. Plus, I love the pure sound of his playing. Like Coltrane on soprano sax, and for that matter Sonny Rollins on tenor and Gerry Mulligan on baritone, Parker helped define the instrument, which in his case was mostly alto. When you hear one of these guys play, you KNOW who it is.For the most part, I agree with everything the other reviewers here say about this set and its great value. So why do I withhold one star while the others give it five? Because I'm mean. No, because I believe quite firmly that this set could have been organized slightly differently: In short, I would have separated the fragmentary takes from the rest of the material here. I know that would have compromised chronology and continuity, but it also would have made for more of a LISTENING experience instead of a historical one.That said, I have spent many, many hours with this incredible collection of music. My favorite of all the discs is No. 8, which consists of four long songs on which Parker and his friends stretch out, beginning with the exuberant power of "Jam Blues," my most beloved track on the album. Folks, if you've heard this, you've heard the sound of jazz at its best.This is an incredible box set, one of the true cornerstones of my music collection. I simply can't imagine life without it.

"Chicago V" was Chicago's first one-disc album, having been preceded by the four-LP "Chicago at Carnegie Hall" and not one, not two, but THREE double studio albums. "Chicago Transit Authority I," the band's debut, was terrific, and "Chicago II" had its moments. Sadly, "Chicago III" sounds mediocre by comparison. The band had been writing, recording and touring almost nonstop for a couple years, and clearly was a bit worn out. "III" should have been pared down and released as one disc, and if I had been in the producer's seat, here's what I would have done with the songs:1. "Sing a Mean Tune, Kid": I love keyboardist Robert Lamm's writing but I've never cared for this rather sour song. At the very least, I would have trimmed it from nine minutes or so to about five or six.2. "Loneliness Is Just a Word": Another Lamm song; excellent just as it is.3. "What Else Can I Say": A very forgettable song by bassist Peter Cetera that should have been left off the album entirely.4. "I Don't Want Your Money": Written by Lamm with guitarist Terry Kath. Never one of my favorites, but worthy of inclusion.Note: The following six songs were labeled "Travel Suite," written mostly by Lamm but with contributions from Kath, saxman Walt Parazaider and drummer Danny Seraphine:5. "Flight 602": Pretty slight; I could do without it.6. "Motorboat to Mars": A snappy Seraphine drum solo, a keeper.7. "Free": Terrific song by Lamm.8. "Free Country": This one wanders a bit but I do like it; it shows the band at its more experimental.9. "At the Sunrise": A pretty nice piece of pop candy by Lamm.10. "Happy Cause I'm Goin' Home": Utterly pointless.11. "Mother": A good, politically aware environmental song by Lamm.12. "Lowdown": This collaboration by Seraphine and Cetera was the album's only real hit single, and even it didn't chart very high.Note: The next five songs, written by Terry Kath, were really a connected suite called "An Hour in the Shower":13. "A Hard-Risin' Morning Without Breakfast; 14. "Off to Work"; 15."Fallin' Out"; 16. "Dreamin' Home"; 17. "Morning Blues Again." Kath was my favorite guy in Chicago prior to his accidental shooting death in 1978; he was a fine guitarist and the band's most soulful singer. More often than not, he also was a great songwriter. But "An Hour in the Shower" isn't his finest work. The whole thing was supposed to be kind of his "Day in the Life" riff, but it's just too slight -- it sounds like it was written in a hurry, and isn't very satisfying.Finally, "Elegy" was a six-part suite written by trombonist James Pankow, and I can't even bring myself to list the songs. I find this one of the worst, most misguided things Chicago ever recorded. Pankow breaks no new ground musically. The toilet flush at the end of "Progress?" is not ... exactly ... SUBTLE, thank you! And while Pankow usually could be counted on to write some good jazz riffs and horn charts, "The Approaching Storm" was overcooked.And that's the album ... way too much of it. How much better would it have been like the following?1. Sing a Mean Tune, Kid (six-minute version).2. Loneliness Is Just a Word.3. I Don't Want Your Money.4. Motorboat to Mars.5. Free.6. Free Country.7. At the Sunrise.8. Mother.9. Lowdown.10. An Hour in the Shower (edited version).That's the album Chicago should have made for "III."

This is one of those books that, like Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style," should never be out of vogue. Brady's tips on interviewing and his discussion, too, of what does NOT work, are essential for journalists but also anyone who wants to succeed in the business world -- or in any job requiring "people skills." Good interviewers are good listeners. I was in the journalism field for nearly three decades and kept going back to this book for refreshers. I still find it useful in my current job; in fact, I just bought my third copy.

"The Who Sell Out" isn't the Who's most rocking album; that's "Live at Leeds." It's not one of the band's full-on rock operas -- "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia." It's not their most "complete" album, lyrically and musically; that would be "Who's Next." But without a doubt, it's the most fun."Sell Out" takes as its conceit the idea that you're listening to "Radio London," one of London's great "pirate" radio stations from the 1960s. Some of them actually did broadcast, apparently, from seagoing ships -- Radio London transmitted from a ship anchored in the North Sea -- so the name was apt. And so, in addition to the great songs, the Who programs into the mix some fake (and real, it turns out) commercial jingles. The classic "I Can See For Miles," for example, is preceded by a short little ditty that goes like this: "Hold your group together / With Rotosound Strings!" Who bassist John Entwistle really did use Rotsounds, and the company remains in business to this day.Other jingles on "Sell Out" include "Heinz Baked Beans," no explanation needed; "Odorono," a song promoting a fictitious deodorant, and "Medac" for an acne cream.But without real songs -- and really good songs -- "Sell Out" would not continue to be held in such high esteem. It featured some tremendous tunes, including the snarling "Armenia City in the Sky," the innuendo-laced "Mary Anne With the Shaky Hands" (think about it), the aforementioned raving and rocking "I Can See For Miles," and some genuinely great pop balladry as evidenced by "Our Love Was" and "Tattoo." There was also a Pete Townshend solo track -- the starkly beautiful "Sunrise," featuring just Townshend's voice instead of lead singer Roger Daltrey's, accompanied by Townshend's guitar."Sell Out" was not, alas, the album that made the Who worldwide stars; the band would have to wait till "Tommy" for that. But it's clearly their greatest early record, surpassing "My Generation" and "A Quick One" for sheer wit and songwriting ability.And besides ... it's just so ... much ... FUN.

More than a few critics were pretty hostile toward Pink Floyd's "Animals" when the album was released in 1977. Then again, the Floyd had set the bar so high on its previous two releases that it's not really surprising there would be a backlash. 1975's "Wish You Were Here" and 1973's "Dark Side of the Moon" still rank as two of the greatest British rock albums of all time, with their grand lyrical scope and excellent music.And those two albums SOUNDED so good -- they were like the rock 'n' roll equivalent of tropical jungles, incredibly lush and richly complex."Animals" was still a sonic pleasure, but it was a step down, partly because Pink Floyd was setting up its own studio, and the equipment and recording spaces just were not up to the quality standards of Abbey Road, where they (and a band called the Beatles) had recorded previously.Furthermore, "Animals" had a much harder edge. Gone were the Dick Parry sax solos that had made "Dark Side" and "Wish You Were Here" sound so warm and appealing. In their place, guitarist David Gilmour was delving into a more aggressive style; his playing always had been quite good, but it never rocked as hard as it does here.Finally, there was the issue of songwriting. Of the five cuts -- the two parts of "Pigs on the Wing," plus the longer "Dogs," "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" and "Sheep" -- two were retreads. "Dogs," previously called "You Gotta Be Crazy," and "Sheep," once known as "Raving and Drooling," had not made the cut for "Wish You Were Here." Bassist/vocalist/lyricist Roger Waters rewrote them, introducing the animal themes to go along with the "Pigs" songs and hey, presto! A new concept album was born, cast very much in the likness of George Orwell's "Animal Farm," where the pigs are the intellectual but morally ambiguous overlords, the dogs are their "muscle," and the sheep must follow blindly or be torn to pieces.This was Waters' scathing commentary on late-1970s English ennui and bitterness. Economic woes and a general sense of unease really were in the air -- and everyone knows that in bad times, people do tend to become a bit more animalistic."Dogs" is my favorite track here. The lack of saxes aside, the 17-minute song features some absolutely blazing Gilmour guitar work. And the song boasts something a lot of fans (and critics) have missed over the years. Gilmour sings the first half of it ... and he sings in the second-person point of view, too ("you" this and "you" that). After the instrumental break, Waters takes over the vocals through the song's end, and Waters' contribution is in FIRST person ("I gotta admit..." and so on). The shift -- from Gilmour's more tuneful voice to Waters' more brittle one, from the slight distance provided by the second person to the incredibly withering personal feel of the first person -- is at once subtle, dramatic and effective.The other songs here are not as good. "Pigs on the Wing," split into two parts on most formats, opens and closes the album. Musical historians and dinosaurs such as myself will remember that there was an 8-track-only version, which joined the two pieces with a solo by Snowy White, who played second guitar on some Floyd tours (Gilmour declined to do it himself, for some reason). "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" is pushed along by a swirling organ part from keyboardist Rick Wright, and it sounds positively dated after the synth sounds Wright had created for "Wish You Were Here.""Sheep," the album closer, was actually quite a powerful song, even though lyrically it displayed the same bitterness that marked the rest of "Animals."Flaws or no, this album has long been a favorite of mine. My top two PF albums are "Dark Side" and "Wish," but I would put "Animals" third -- ahead of "The Wall" and definitely better than "The Final Cut," "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" and "The Division Bell."But this is also the album on which serious cracks began to develop in Floydworld -- big divisions and bad feelings between band members. For one thing, previously prolific keyboardist Wright had no songs to contribute, which angered Waters, who felt he was shouldering more and more of the creative burden (Gilmour co-wrote, with Waters, the music for "Dogs"). Meanwhile, Gilmour and Waters continued their bickering over how the Floyd should sound, with Waters preferring a more spare, "drier" sound and Gilmour pushing for more reverb and gloss. By the time "The Wall" was finished, Waters would insist Wright be fired. Waters himself then left the band after "The Final Cut," and Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason brought Wright back for the two subsequent studio albums.Not until 2005 would Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunite with Waters, and then it was for a one-off performance at the Live 8 concert in London. Wright died of cancer in 2008, apparently bringing the Floyd era to its end."Animals" is a reminder of how Pink Floyd sounded at their most forceful and bellicose. It's a great record to revisit after all these years.

I cannot help but agree with the many critics and viewers who have declared that "The Dark Knight" is the best-ever superhero movie. In fact, in my opinion, nothing else even comes CLOSE.This is, quite simply, excellent moviemaking, with great characters, unforgettable visuals, and (thank GOD!) a story that actually works. That last element is the one most superhero -- indeed, many genre -- movies lack. Too often, the script is just poor -- lazily written, no character development, nonsensical. Here, though, we get a terrific, if not terribly original, story: The Joker appears, intent on wreaking havoc on Gotham City, apparently just because he can. He doesn't really need a reason, which works because it reflects the senselessness of our Age of Terror. Meanwhile, a good man named Harvey Dent is going bad, transforming into the hideously burned Two-Face.And, worst of all, Batman -- never trusted that much anyway -- may just have to take the fall for everything that goes wrong.Christian Bale's Batman is more nuanced and yet more powerful in this sequel. Aaron Eckhart brings true pathos to his depiction of Harvey Dent/Two-Face; you genuinely feel for him because of the torment he suffers, and yet at the same time, he horrifies.Best of all, though, was Heath Ledger as the Joker. It truly was a performance for the ages -- and would have been recognized as such even if the actor had not died not long after completing the role. Ledger is just fantastic in conveying the Joker's arrogance, pain, viciousness and, yes, wicked amusement at all he does.Director Christopher Nolan, whose work I've always liked (see "Memento" if you haven't!) is superb here -- and I say that as someone who is NOT a fan of shifting aspect ratios. I don't really know how he did it, but he makes it work here. In the theater, the aspect ratio shifted from 2.40:1 to 1.43:1 for the IMAX scenes. Nolan can't do that on the home-theater version, but does make use of the contrast between 2:40 and 1.78:1 on the blu-ray version. I should absolutely hate this -- it's not a technique that's used much, but when it has been, I have found it jarring and unpleasant. Here, it didn't bother me in the slightest -- I just watched the movie and was carried away by it.I also agree with those who say the movie is too long -- and yet, having seen it once in the theater and several times at home now, I'm usually at a loss to say what I think should have been cut out."The Dark Knight" is an extraordinary experience. I don't know how Nolan is going to top this, but I eagerly await the third and final installment.

John Updike's "Couples" is not his best novel, but it's not his worst, either. This is, in fact, a very good book about marriage and infidelity, set in the 1960s as the sexual revolution swept over America.Updike published the book in 1968, as that revolution was still building; one coult argue that the sexual revolution did not reach its peak until sometime in the early 1970s. The novel focuses on several fictional New England couples, and Updike is at his best in this book not in the more explicit sexual scenes, but rather in the passages that chronicle the various characters' faint but very real dissatisfactions with their lives.Unfortunately, there is no character in these pages nearly as compelling as Harry Angstrom, (anti-)hero of Updike's tetralogy of "Rabbit" novels. Piet Hanema, the main character here, is vivid enough, but one senses he was more elusive for Updike -- there's something ghostly about the man, something not quite real or as fully created.It is, however, somewhat unrealistic of me to demand such a character from "Couples." I don't think Updike intended it as a deep map of one man's mind, body and soul, as the "Rabbit" novels offer. Instead, this is more of an ensemble cast, and an exploration of several lives -- including musings on how a single individual's actions can have devastating effects on others."Couples" is a worthy novel, though modern readers might actually find it somewhat quaint now. The sexual revolution ended not in a radiant burst of everlasting free love but with the specter of AIDS, and the realization that with freedom comes responsibility. This novel, though it may be fiction, reads as a sort of soap-operatic (I mean that in a good way) documentary of the moral choices Americans were grappling with in the face of great social change.

I debated a long, long time before buying this. The expense, and some of the really bad reviews, put me off for awhile. But I've been a Neil Young fan since I was about 15, and that means 36 years now. Ultimately, I couldn't resist this.I'm very glad I succumbed. :) Volume One of Young's "Archives" is, OBVIOUSLY, for the hardcore fan, but for us, it's just an amazing experience.Hearing some of Young's more problematic material on Blu-ray is a delight and a revelation. Even after it was remastered and partly remixed just a few months after its initial 1968 release, Young's eponymous debut solo album never sounded quite right. The vocals were tough to hear, and on the songs with more complex instrumentation, the overall sonic picture lacked clarity.One of the first things I did, then, when I received this box was to cue up "The Old Laughing Lady" from that first album. The multichannel Blu-ray mix astonished me. From Young's vocal to Jack Nitzsche's electric piano to Earl Palmer's drums, the parts were easy to hear -- and, at long, long last, I could hear what Young was aiming for here: A kind of orchestral folk/pop/rock. This always has been one of my favorite Young songs, and he's recorded other versions of it, including live renderings, but it was excellent to hear the original in this brave new setting.The format also proves beneficial to Young's noisier numbers, including the early stuff recorded with backup band Crazy Horse. "Cowgirl in the Sand" and "Down by the River," both from "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere," are a hoot to hear; the mix allows your ears to distinguish between the guitars of Young and the late Danny Whitten as never before. And despite the Horse's reputation for sloppiness ... well, all I can say is they sound great here, including the rhythm section of drummer Ralph Molina and bassist Billy Talbot.OK, things I DON'T like about the set: Give me a break with all this "hidden track" stuff, and the Easter Egg approach to finding them. Come on ... first of all, is it REALLY a hidden track when you tell people they're there? Then present them with the challenge of finding them? It almost feels like being baited. Sorry, but with this much material, just present it as simply and straightforwardly as possible. Another gripe: I wish, upon inserting the disc, we'd be prompted to use PCM. Yes, there's a reminder to do so, but on my player, at least, I have to go into the setup menu of the player and select it as the HDMI output. Failing to do so prohibits you from getting the full lossless mix. Because I watch a lot of movies, I prefer my player's default setting to be bitstream, simply so the idiot lights on my receiver do work, letting me know something is in DTS HD Master or whatever.Finally, to those who complained that the visual element of this set consists of images of tape recorders and albums spinning around: That's only when you select play all. Accessing the tracks individually allows you to view a huge amount of information, from photos to lyric sheets to memorabilia such as original album covers. There's also a timeline function that clearly is going to eat up a lot of my time over the next few months, given its interactive nature.

Since first using this setting solution on a WWII submarine model kit, I cannot imagine being without it. Here is a product that works exactly as the manufacturer says it does, and it works every single time with great consistency, as long as it's applied correctly."What's the big deal?" some might ask. "You just stick the decals to the model." Well, the big deal is that many model-kit surfaces are not conducive to adhesion, even with the best waterslide decals. For example: Any surface painted with flat paint can pose a problem -- flat paint is not nearly as smooth as glossy or even semi-glossy; under a microscope, you can see that the surface is very uneven, making it difficult for any decal to take hold. Also, any surface that has raised lines or recessed grooves can be problematic.Using Micro Sol allows the decal to soften and set, with the result giving the appearance that it was painted on. A couple of examples where it's been especially helpful for me:1. Revell's 1/72 kit of the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane. The model, like the original, has grooves on the wing surface, which in the real world served as heat sinks. The instructions call for the placement of some decals on these grooved wing areas. I placed each decal, then used a very soft, clean paintbrush to brush on the Micro Sol. You may have to take care to reposition the decal after applying the solution -- and if it has shifted, you should do it quickly, before the Micro Sol begins to soften the decal.2. AMT's "cadet series" of the various U.S.S. Enterprises. The Enterprise in the "Original Series" was fairly smooth, but later versions such as Enterprise D from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" have grid patterns of raised lines. Again, the procedure is to place the decal, brush it with some Micro Sol, and let the solution do its work. Result: Instead of an unattractive "the decal is just sitting there on the surface" appearance, the illusion is that the decal really is part of the surface.I highly recommend this for every model maker from beginner to advanced.

...and review the film the only way I know how: As a person who believes this isn't simply the best film Stanley Kubrick ever made, but also the best movie in cinematic history. Forget "Citizen Kane" or "Vertigo" or "Casablanca" or "The Godfather"; "2001: A Space Odyssey," changed the course of movie history.Prior to "2001," many directors (and audience members) still seemed to regard films as a kind of extension of the stage; movies, with the aid of special effects, could do things that a theatrical production couldn't, but aside from that, the storytelling methods were still very much like a play. The dependency on sets is understandable in some contexts; what puzzles more is that film, THE visual medium, was still quite insistent on a relative preponderance of dialogue.Not even Kubrick had dared go this far prior to "2001"; of its 142-minute running time (trimmed from the premiere length of 161 minutes), only about three-quarters of an hour consisted of dialogue. Furthermore, what dialogue there was seemed almost deliberately banal, as if Kubrick were further telegraphing the message to his viewers that the meaning of this film could not be derived from mere words.The story, rather, was in the visuals -- and what visuals they were, and remain.The film opens several million years in the past. A group of bipeds -- call them early apelike humans or late humanlike apes -- struggles to survive in the hostile climate of Africa. They regularly have disputes, which consist mostly of guttural shouts, with another group visually identical to themselves; said disputes often take place, apparently, at a miserable-looking little watering hole. One night, a mysterious object appears near the sleeping cave of the first group: A black monolith. Over time, it seems to do something to these creatures, increasing their intelligence somehow. The group learns, for one thing, to kill for meat. For another, its next encounter with the "adversary" group is not limited to mere words.Following this, there occurs what must be, by now, the most famous jump-cut in film history.Part two of "2001" takes place in the very late 1990s or perhaps 2000. Unlike our "real" 1990s, humans have achieved rather more; there is now a full-time base on the Moon, and travel between Earth and Moon is as commonplace. Dr. Heywood Floyd is sent to the American component of the Moon outposts to deal with an odd discovery -- an object that had been buried in the lunar soil. Yes, a black monolith. Upon its first exposure to sunlight, the object emits a powerful blast of radio energy.Part three of the film concerns "The Jupiter Mission," eighteen months later, in 2001. A crew of two humans is piloting the spaceship Discovery on an exploratory mission to the moons of the solar system's largest planet. Also on board: Three more men in suspended animation or hypersleep, a survey team that will be awakened only when the ship completes its long journey to Jovian space. The sixth crew member is not human, but rather a sentient computer named HAL.The mission does not go as planned. With great respect to those who have not seen this masterpiece, I decline to offer any plot spoilers. Suffice it to say that the goals of men and machines do not always mesh.Part four of "2001" is surely one of the strangest, most fascinating, most thought-provoking sequences ever put on the big screen. Mission Commander David Bowman must confront something -- someone? -- far beyond the realm of his experience. Even if I wanted to describe what happens to him, I'm not sure I could do it justice, and I have seen the movie dozens and dozens of time.But it is here, among stars far, far from Earth, that the film's multiplicity of meanings becomes evident. The ending of "2001" has provided dialogue, discussion, argument, and at times quite heated argument to several generations of film watchers by now. The fact that no two people seem to get exactly the same thing out of the film is testament to its greatness.Though released in 1968, few other science fiction films made in the ensuing four and a half decades have managed to look this good. In addition to pondering the very meaning of existence, Kubrick's film has provided eye candy to millions and millions of geeks. The look of science fiction, especially space-based science fiction, owes a tremendous amount to this film. From the "Star Trek" films, with their visuals upgraded from the 1960s TV series, to the ships of "Star Wars" to "Battlestar Galactica" and so on, it's hard to imagine any of them without "2001." Even Ridley Scott owes a debt; certainly he strove to grunge things up with "Alien" and "Prometheus," but he would be the first to admit that his visual style would not have evolved as it did without Stanley Kubrick and "2001."I guess by now you realize I highly recommend the film. Just one caveat: Be warned that it moves at a pace that was considered very slow even in 1968. I prefer to think of it as "stately." Those without the patience for its peculiar world, though, will conclude it's simply boring. A few people, over the years, have confessed to me that this was, indeed, their dim view of the film. In each and every case, the person in question was an acquaintance, and not someone I ever chose to pursue friendship. One woman, indeed, was so arrogantly dismissive of the film that I downgraded my view of her from merely odious to absolutely vile. In short, the film does not seem to appeal to those who are unimaginative, even though they may be reasonably intelligent. Sadly, but truly, some of us are Earthbound.For the rest of us: Behold this starry black sky, and all it may offer.

I still think it's impossible to top "The Witching Hour," which was one of the most complete books of Anne Rice's long career; everything in it worked, from the characters to the storytelling to the setting. But "Taltos" did surprise me with its freshness and its narrative drive. Not my favorite of Anne's works, but definitely a great read.

Lots of companies make good slides for guitar players -- Latch Lake comes to mind. But few companies make practical slides that also qualify as works of art. Rocky Mountain's products are incredible -- heavy, durable, resonant, but also very pretty to look at. I bought this one for my dad for Christmas. Every slide I've seen from this company is well-crafted and appealing.

I, like the author, am obsessed with rivers; I've been an avid canoeist and kayaker for many years. This book's premise -- travel across America inland but on water, with a minimum of portages -- fascinated me. And the author did not disappoint; there's some very good descriptive writing here.Essentially, this is a travelogue, and the point of a travelogue, in my opinion, is to put you in the scene. Heat-Moon does that very well; I've been to a number of places along the Missouri, specifically, that he describes, and he absolutely nails it.Pretensions: Some have complained about the author combining his seven companions along the journey into one figure called Pilotis. I would argue this wasn't pretentious but rather a NECESSARY narrative choice. The whole point of the book is the watery trek, not the individual personalities of the first mate. Doing it the way the author did -- and also not naming minor real-life characters such as the Reporter and the Photographer -- keeps the story moving, and this book is all about movement.I will, though, agree with those who say that a bit of self-righteousness had crept into the author's writing by the time this book was composed, which is why I give it four stars instead of five. Still, it's an incredible read for anyone with a sense of adventure.

If we omit "Fear and Desire," an early film that Stanley Kubrick removed from circulation, and his short films and documentaries, the director made only 12 movies in his career. But what a dozen they are! Kubrick was not the most prolific of directors, but to me, he was the greatest.Although I love all his films, there are several that stand out: "Paths of Glory," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Barry Lyndon" -- and "Dr. Strangelove." Given those five films, an affectionate companion and a desert island, I could be reasonably content until the end of time."Dr. Strangelove" is essential Kubrick because it is nearly perfect in its conception and its execution. Think of it -- a comedy about nuclear holocaust in 1964? Kubrick was far ahead of his time. This isn't the only oh-no-we're-nuked movie that has stood up well; others include "On the Beach," "Testament" and even the TV movie, "The Day After." But it's the only one that dares play it for laughs.Despite the comedy, however, as you watch it, the sense of menace becomes real enough. Kubrick's re-creation of the War Room is a dark, cavernous place where even the most outrageous ideas and statements are not only tolerated but, for the most part, condoned. It was always our hope, as citizens living in the nuclear age, that our leaders would be people of reason, intelligence, restraint. Here, though, Kubrick depicts a roomful of madmen. The only thing in question: Who's craziest?The cast is outstanding: Peter Sellers in three different roles including the titular one, Slim Pickens, a young James Earl Jones, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, whose preoccupation with Americans' "precious bodily fluids" leads the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of World War III.My first viewing of this film was this: I was a kid, not yet 10 years old. I saw just a fragment of it, including the end. Maybe 10 minutes, tops. I asked my dad to explain it to me. He just started laughing ... and then did his best. Even that brief exposure to it left me disturbed for a couple days.Watch this film if you haven't. Watch it again if you have. I've lost TRACK of the number of times I've watched it ... and will watch it again, I'm sure, soon.

I had this book as a kid and read it to pieces. My copy ended up taped-up by my mom, and, ultimately, tossed out. I paid WAY too much to reacquire it recently, but had to see if it lived up to my memories. It did -- seen now through an adult's eyes, of course. What a great collection. Get it if you can find one for a reasonable amount of money, and share it with your kids next time Halloween comes around.

"Led Zeppelin III" was the album on which the band discovered its very soul. The first album had benefited from applying a colossal rock sound to a blues sensibility, but too much of it sounded (and was) unoriginal. Songs like "How Many More Times" had been adapted from -- some would say just ripped off from -- classic blues artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon. "Led Zeppelin II" was better, showing more of the group's own personality in songs like "Thank You." But it was "Led Zeppelin III" that pointed the way to the band's years of true greatness.And oddly enough, it seemed to put off some fans who had already come to depend on that thundering, bluesy hard-rock approach of the first two albums. "Immigrant Song" and "Since I've Been Loving You" were recognizable enough, with vocalist Robert Plant finding his inner banshee on the former and drummer John Bonham bashing the living daylights out of kit on the latter. "Out on the Tiles," which closed side one of the vinyl album, featured some aptly grungy riffs from guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones. But two songs on that first side hinted at something different: "Friends" and "Celebration Day" had a lighter, more ethereal touch.And when listeners flipped the album over, they might've wondered at first if they weren't listening to a different band. These songs were softer, craftier, far more exploratory than anything Zep had done to that point. "Gallows Pole" was a traditional song based on an old blues about trying to bribe the hangman, its eeriness underscored by acoustic guitar, mandolin and banjo. "Tangerine" would end up, years later, as part of the soundtrack for "Almost Famous," and indeed there was something of innocence and youthful joy -- but also wistfulness -- in its sweet melody. "That's the Way" was about as stark as Zeppelin ever got: Most of the song is driven only by Plant's atypically quiet vocal and Page's strummed acoustic guitar. Jones' bass doesn't come in until the song nears its conclusion, and Bonham doesn't even seem to be playing a full kit when he comes in; I hear tambourine and bass drum but, if I'm right, nothing else. "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp" and "Hats off to (Roy) Harper" both featured a bit more instrumental beef, with some electric parts from page and some odd, sweeping effects added to the instruments and vocal on "Harper."It was great music in its own right. It represented growth for the band. And it set the table for Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, although it's often referred to as "Led Zeppelin IV" or "Zoso." On that disc, the four gents would perfect their quest for balancing acoustic and electric, light and shade, loud and soft. But "Led Zeppelin III" remains a favorite of mine. Play the last half on a misty day when the sun is playing hide and seek with the clouds. It'll send you.

"Keep us."Guide us."Till the end of time."These words come whispered, hushed, at a key moment in Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life"; we hear these words spoken as the universe itself flickers into oblivion. Clearly these words are the words of prayer, but they sound not like the prayer of petitioning but rather more meditative, as if the speaker already believes in everything sacred, as if the spirit voicing these thoughts already knows that guidance is given, eternally.For those without the imagination or faith to embrace such a moment, Malick's film will be tedious, meaningless, perhaps even infuriating. For anyone, though, with even a shred of religious feeling, "The Tree of Life" could stand as one of the greatest films ever made. Yet it requires no dogma, no denomination; if you haven't set foot in church in twenty years, still it will move you if you allow it.Malick has done many fine things with this movie, which is so unlike any sort of traditional Hollywood film that it's hard to believe it got made. It's almost impossible to find a comparison, though one does come to mind: Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." For "Tree," Malick coaxed "2001" special effects genius Douglas Trumbull out of retirement. The scenes of the universe, and of life developing on Earth, are so stunning and beautiful they will bring tears ... and will remind the careful viewer of the visuals Trumbull helped create for Kubrick.Yet while Kubrick's prime concern in "2001" was the human intellect, Malick's is the human soul. I am not one of the people who find Kubrick cold; I think his films inspire awe, but I have to agree that Malick has a different tilt.Put simply, the plot description seems so mundane: A boy remembers growing up in the 1950s as his father struggled to make a mark for himself and his mother struggled to emphasize to her sons that "making a living" isn't nearly as important as ... LIVING. Yet Malick has placed this simple story in such a grand frame that it becomes much more than just the story of a few individuals. The conflict between cruel nature and the state of grace ends up applying to everything in creation. Water and rock, earth and sky, creatures ranging from dinosaur to human ... All is in motion, and nature and grace are at work constantly.This is a superb, searching film that dares delve into the very bedrock of existence. Certainly it asks more questions than it answers, but great art does that.

"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" is not even CLOSE to being my favorite Pink Floyd album, but it was a very important one for the band.Bassist Roger Waters had left in acrimony after 1983's "The Final Cut." Waters had fired keyboardist Rick Wright at the end of "The Wall" sessions, though Wright played during the short concert tour that followed. That reduced the band to guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason. They insisted they were going to continue as Pink Floyd, but Waters considered the band creatively spent, and didn't want them to use the Pink Floyd name. He went so far as to sue them over it, and the legal actions and counter-actions reached epic proportions, with both sides also airing out their differences in the American and UK music press.In the midst of all this, Gilmour and Mason brought Wright back into the PF fold, further annoying Waters (who had claimed Wright hadn't been contributing enough to the band, creatively speaking). At any rate, when the dust all settled, it wasn't really any of Waters' business anymore -- he had left the band. Gilmour and Mason, the courts decided, were free to carry on as Pink Floyd. Wright was initially brought back as a salaried employee instead of a full-fledged member.And despite all the distractions, the band eventually got around to recording "A Momentary Lapse of Reason." My judgment of the album: Musically, it's very good -- it is much more "Floydian" in its sound, with all the snappy guitars and lush keyboard sounds -- than "The Final Cut" had been. Lyrically, though, it doesn't stand up to Pink Floyd's best work. Roger Waters had taken over all the lyric writing for "Dark Side of the Moon," and also had penned all lyrics for "Wish You Were Here," "Animals," "The Wall" and "The Final Cut."For "AMLOR," Gilmour took on some of the lyric chores himself and also brought in songwriting partners such as Anthony Moore. The results were mixed -- songs such as "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away," both featuring lyrical contributions from Moore, were quite emotionally effective and resonant. Other songs -- "The Dogs of War," "Sorrow" -- didn't add up to much.The album's musical lushness was a return to form, but it was unfortunate that Mason and Wright's involvement was minimal. Wright was brought back only after the album was well along in the recording process, and plays on just six of the ten tracks. Mason appears on seven of them, but plays drums on just three -- his other contributions are limited to drum machine, percussion and a spoken vocal. Mason was going through difficult marital problems at the time, and, according to Gilmour, both Mason and Wright had developed confidence problems thanks in part to Waters' withering criticisms over the years. On several tracks here, then, they're not present at all or are underrepresented, their places being taken by the likes of session musicians Bill Payne and Jon Carin (keyboards) and Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner (drums).The situation led to accusations that this was nothing but a Gilmour solo album released under the Pink Floyd name in order to rake in the bucks from fans. That's too harsh. On the best tracks here -- "Learning to Fly," "One Slip," "On the Turning Away" -- the fusion of thoughtful, witty lyrics and dense, immersive music recall Pink Floyd at their best.

"Roughing It" is, quite simply, one of the best books Mark Twain ever produced. Funny, yes; there are passages that are just howlers, such as the drunken miner trying to tell a story about his grandfather's old ram. But this book also constitutes a glimpse into the nature of America's westward expansion. It wasn't always pretty; it was, in fact, rambunctious and vulgar and, in many ways, horribly damaging. But it happened, and Twain doesn't blink as he describes his encounters with outlaws, villains, and yes, even heroes.

"Red Octopus" is probably the best album Jefferson Starship ever made. It had one huge advantage over its predecessor, "Dragon Fly," that being former Airplane vocalist Marty Balin joining the Starship full-time instead of just guesting on one song (he'd sung on "Dragon Fly's" "Caroline").Balin also contributes significantly to the songwriting on the album, co-writing four tracks. But "Miracles" was credited solely to him, and it remains a Starship standout. Balin has an expressive voice, and he's never been one to hold back when it comes to writing and singing a romantic ballad. "Miracles" is one of his greatest compositions.His fellow vocalist Grace Slick is almost as prolific here, contributing to four tracks, including the album's excellent opener, "Fast Buck Freddie."But one essential key to Jefferson Airplane and then starship has always been rhythm guitarist Paul Kantner. If he's engaged and involved in the project, it's likely to be good -- have a listen to the underrated "Spitfire," for example, for which Kantner co-wrote three essential tracks ("Dance With the Dragon," "St. Charles" and "Don't Let it Rain.") If Kantner absents himself from a recording, as he did on the Starship's "Earth," the outcome generally is dismal.Kantner co-writes only two songs on "Red Octopus," but with just one listen you can tell he's thoroughly on board here. His rich baritone voice was always a good complement to Balin's plaintive tenor and Slick's confident alto, and throughout "Red Octopus," you can hear Kantner stepping up to the mic and strengthening the vocal parts. The songs he co-writes are excellent: "There Will Be Love" and the sci-fi-ish "I Want to See Another World."And finally, the whole band just plays its a** off. Especially noteworthy are Pete Sears and David Freiberg, who during their years together in the Starship shared keyboard and bass guitar duties. Their collective playing on "Octopus" is outstanding, with Sears excelling on piano and Freiberg on organ.If I have one criticism, it's that the Starship went pretty ballad-heavy on "Octopus" -- but the result was an album that garnered the band a lot of airplay and helped give them the freedom to be a bit more exploratory on the follow-up, "Spitfire." Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. Released in 1975, smack-dab in the middle of the 1970s, "Red Octopus" is a great listen for anyone still interested in that era, in which haunting melodies, seasoned performance and unabashed love songs hadn't yet fallen victim to cynicism and ennui.

"Dragon Fly" was Jefferson Starship before the band dropped the Jefferson (at departing/founding member Paul Kantner's insistence) and embarked upon a career of mashed-potatoes pop along the lines of the revolting "We Built This City." It also was the first real JS record, after the crash landing in the early 1970s of the Jefferson Airplane. It's a lovely, complex and mysterious record, showing all the qualities the band sacrificed later in search of singles and airplay.Some great standout songs here: "Ride the Tiger," "Hyperdrive," "Devil's Den" and "All Fly Away." Best of all, though, is the ballad co-written with Kantner and sung by Airplane founder Marty Balin, "Caroline." It's an absolutely soaring piece of pop theater that only Balin had the voice to pull off. Some recommend that if you buy one Jefferson Starship album, it should be "Red Octopus," which does feature a strong track list including Balin's "Miracles," but I prefer "Dragon Fly." This is, in my opinion, the one JS album to get.

For some reason, I was skeptical about "K-19." For one thing, the film had been a box-office bomb, reportedly costing $100 million to make and earning back only two-thirds of that cost, and that's counting domestic AND foreign receipts. For another, it starred Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in the two lead roles, and I HATE it when Westerners play Soviets.But when I finally decided to watch it, I could not tear myself away. I came away from the viewing having been convinced by the special effects, tightly woven plot and great performances. Ford is excellent and Neeson is even better, and the supporting cast does just a tremendous job.Also, what could have been a weakness turns out to be a strength. Most WWII sub movies I've seen involve some kind of variation on the following: Destroyer drops depth charges trying to kill German sub below. Sub crew is terrified, but sub somehow survives. Sub torpedoes convoy, then gets comeuppance of some kind at hands of Allies. And most Cold War sub movies also follow a pattern, this one involving the threat of the release of nuclear weapons that could destroy the world. "K-19" is different; as others here have written, it is based on true events involving two separate Soviet nuclear sub disasters in which there were reactor malfunctions.So: The enemy here isn't the guy commanding the enemy boat; the enemy is radiation itself. Director Kathryn Bigelow handles this theme perfectly, making it so harrowing that we can't look away, and showing incredible compassion for the sailors who are ordered into the reactor room to deal with the catastrophe. Bigelow became the first woman to win the Oscar for Best Director with "The Hurt Locker," but she's also directed cult classics such as the vampire-noir "Near Dark." Her work on "K-19" is nothing less than superb.Her efforts in making us empathize with the sub's crew avoid being jingoistic apologia for the Soviet system thanks to her brutal depiction of the so-called Soviet "leadership" -- the military and Politburo figures are depicted as a gang of ruthlessly corrupt incompetents who are capable of incredible self-delusions. During the Cold War itself, I might have wondered if Bigelow hadn't gone too far with this, but history has proven that the Soviet Union's political machine was nothing less than ghastly.Without spoiling the end of the film, I will just say that it involves a shift in time and perspective. I bring this up because it is incredibly moving -- a fitting conclusion to a fine film."K-19" is now on my short list of great submarine films. I believe it stands well with titles such as "Das Boot," "Crimson Tide," "The Hunt for Red October" and "U-571." But you don't have to be a sub geek like me to appreciate it. This is not only a great submarine film; it is great drama.

Like many other readers, my first encounter with James Blish was via his adaptations, into the short story form, of episodes of the original "Star Trek." In the early 1970s I became a fan of the defunct 1960s series, thanks to its being broadcast in syndication. I couldn't get enough of "Trek," and so would read the Blish versions as soon as each collection was published.NONE of that prepared me for reading Blish's original fiction. He did an admirable job of adapting the "Star Trek" scripts, but let's face it -- it was journeyman work for him; he did it to pay the bills. He wrote his own stories -- "A Case of Conscience," "Black Easter," "The Seedling Stars," "Midsummer Century" -- to unleash his prodigious imagination.And yes, he wrote "Cities in Flight," actually a series of four novels that were, in turn, derived from a series of novellas and short stories originally published in various science fiction magazines. The pieces were not written in chronological order, nor is it clear that Blish knew, from the beginning, how many stories he would write. But this is what he ended up with:"They Shall Have Stars" -- The first novel is set in the early 21st century, on an Earth quite dystopian in nature. In Blish's world, the Cold War does not end, the Soviet Union does not fall, and the West, including the U.S., is grinding itself into paranoid pulp trying to keep up with its superpower adversary. Then a progressive senator (from Alaska!) starts up two secretive research projects, one involving anti-gravity propulsion and the other anti-agathic, or anti-death or longevity, drugs. The senator, Bliss Wagoner, fears the West cannot survive much longer, and hopes to preserve democratic values by seeding the nearby stars with long-lived humans whose interstellar travel is finally made possible by the anti-gravity machines, or "spindizzies," as they're nicknamed."A Life for the Stars" -- This second book picks up the story several hundred years into the future. Centuries have passed, and Earth is now a nearly deserted, desperate planet in the grips of what appears to be a virtually permanent economic depression. Most of Earth's major cities are gone: Taking anti-gravity technology to its logical extreme, they have attached spindizzies to their granite keels to propel them into space, where they become migrant workers among the stars. Various cities have various skills, from mining to oil production to agronomy, and use these specializations to do work for planetary societies in need of their expertise. This book follows a young man named Chris as he makes his way from the mountains of Pennsylvania out into those stars, at first against his will. Interestingly, Blish wrote this novel with the intend of its being marketed to a young-adult audience."Earthman, Come Home" -- This third installment is full-on space opera, chronicling the adventures and misadventures of New York City as it plies its trade throughout the galaxy. New York and most other wandering cities, formerly of Earth, now refer to themselves as "Okies" -- they are migrant workers, hoboes, banished from their home planet by economic depression and forced to seek contract work with other planet-bound societies. The scale of this book especially is just gigantic -- Blish does such a nice job with the writing that you really do suspend disbelief and buy into the idea of a star-cruising Big Apple, it's air supply protected by a "spindizzy" screen, with the same anti-gravity technology powering its propulsion system. New York can travel at speeds far exceeding the speed of light, and its citizens live for centuries thanks to longevity drugs. John Amalfi, the mayor of New York, is several hundred years old at the time the events of the book take place."The Triumph of Time" -- In this fourth and final installment, New York has left the Milky Way Galaxy altogether, stopping its wandering to settle a planet in one of the Magellanic Clouds, two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Amalfi is approaching 1,000 years old, and is beginning to feel his apparent immortality not as a gift but as a curse. He is emotionally spent, spiritually exhausted, bored with his own existence. And then a problem worthy of his skills arises: The very existence of the universe itself seems to be in peril. It may be that Time itself is about to come to an end.I have re-read these four books perhaps a dozen times since first encountering them as a teen nearly 40 years ago. Blish's imagination here is just dazzling, and his writing skills were at their peak in the 1950s and early 1960s when he was composing these stories. "Cities in Flight," as the four books came to be known, is absolutely one of the colossal, classic titles of science fiction.It would have been -- or still might be -- interesting to see what a good filmmaker could make of these novels, but no one has ever tried it and I suspect no one ever will. The story concepts, especially that of "The Triumph of Time," might just be too cerebral for the motion picture format. And getting the special effects right would require a sizable budget and even bigger talent.Some of the science in these books is ... well ... pure hooey, as far as I can tell, though I'm no scientist. And there are anachronisms here; in addition to not foreseeing the fall of the Soviet Union, Blish did not anticipate the development of solid-state electronics or desktop computers. At quite a few points in the last two books, Amalfi and his crew do consult the City Fathers, which is actually a group of more than 100 complex, mainframe computers. But he and his city manager, Mark Hazleton, carry slide rules to perform personal calculations. And the author describes spindizzies, or anti-gravity units, as having vacuum tubes!Well, nobody's perfect. Clearly, I've been able to overlook such things and enjoy these books over and over again.There are certain works of science fiction I cannot imagine never having read. Frank Herbert's "Dune" is on that list. So is Arthur C. Clarke's novel-form take on "2001: A Space Odyssey." And Robert A. Heinlein's "Stranger in a Strange Land." And yes, James Blish's "Cities in Flight," which took me places I never expected to go.

I hate to say it, but this novel feels almost doomed to fail now -- not because it's bad; in fact, it's excellent. But at this late date, our speed of life has gotten so fast, and our attention spans so short, that I wonder how most people are going to take to this story.I just hope readers who missed it the first time around will give it a chance now. It's a remarkable book -- Robinson's "Gilead" has gotten more attention, but this book deserves a wider audience. The characters are very odd but also extremely interesting. I did have a little trouble closing the emotional gap at first -- I felt distanced from them, but as I read, this changed. I suspect that's what the author intended; this is a book about human relationships but also about something larger -- the human condition, and we're all part of that even when, perhaps, we'd rather not be.

"Led Zeppelin IV" got more airplay, thanks to "Stairway to Heaven," and "Whole Lotta Love" from "Led Zeppelin II" is the song that pushed Zeppelin into super-stardom, but make no mistake: "Physical Graffiti," Zep's sixth studio album -- and the only "double album" of the band's career, to use old vinyl terminology -- was the band's masterpiece.I think I've probably listened to this album a couple of hundred times by now, and I just don't get tired of it. Part of the appeal is the range. My guess is that, because they had two discs to work with, Zeppelin decided to throw a bit of everything into the pot.So the result is you get the proto-guitar riffing and sexual innuendo of "Custard Pie," but you also get the heavy, traditional-sounding, slide-guitar blues of "In My Time of Dying." You get the English pastoral of the instrumental "Bron-Yr-Aur" as well as the thunderous travelogue "Kashmir." You get the moody, pensive, dark, guitar-soaked "Ten Years Gone" but also the lighter, ocean-kissed "Down by the Seaside." You get ... OK, you get the picture.This album, in fact, feels like an adventure for your ears. Even after so many listenings, I'm always gratified at the many places it seems to take me.Led Zeppelin never made a truly bad studio album, in my opinion, although "In Through the Out Door" was probably the weakest. "Physical Graffiti" shows the band's brilliance, aggressiveness, and willingness to experiment with its own sound. HIGHLY recommended.

Douglas Trumbull is a legend in filmdom -- he was one of the special-effects wizards for Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," which, more than four decades after its 1968 release, still looks better and more believable than some brand-new science fiction films. More recently, director Terence Malick drew Trumbull out of retirement to help with the FX for "The Tree of Life.""Silent Running," Trumbull's turn as a director, is a really fine piece of science fiction. If the film has a problem, it's that it can seem a bit ... quaint at this point. Made in the early 1970s, it features a Joan Baez song and some decidedly hippie-esque trappings.But it also boasts a superb performance by Bruce Dern, who spends much of the movie acting opposite three diminutive robots (precursors of R2-D2?). And Trumbull's special effects look typically wonderful, despite his not having a budget to work with that was anything near "2001."I recommend this movie. Just keep in mind that it was made some time ago.

"The White Album" is surrounded by so much myth and legend that it's difficult to see it clearly through the lens we must use to see into the past -- specifically 44 years into the past, back to its 1968 release.Yes, this was the album that sent mass murderer Charles Manson over the edge, although if it hadn't been this, something else would have. Yes, this is the album featuring the notorious Lennon/McCartney composition "Helter Skelter," although it should be noted that Manson's interpretation of the song was thoroughly insane.And yes, this is one of the Beatles albums on which the band members often worked by themselves -- or rather on which John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison often worked separately from one another; apparently Ringo Starr does do most if not all the drumming (McCartney played drums on a couple of the tracks when even the affable Ringo got disgusted and quit temporarily).What's amazing about this album is how good it is even though the group members were at odds with one another. The songs they brought to the project were incredibly strong. One, "Don't Pass Me By," is credited to Starr (or his real name Richard Starkey). Lead guitarist George Harrison contributed four songs: "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Piggies," "Savoy Truffle" and "Long, Long, Long." The other 25 songs were credited to rhythm guitarist John Lennon and bassist/keyboardist Paul McCartney, although their songwriting partnership really wasn't active anymore. Hence, it's common knowledge now that "Dear Prudence," for example, was a Lennon song, whereas "Back in the U.S.S.R." was McCartney, and so on.So it wasn't a cohesive album, but it offered some of the most fascinating music of the Beatles' career as a band. Lennon's best tunes ranged from the raucous "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" to the understated "Julia" to the gritty "Yer Blues." McCartney contributed several fine songs, including the pensive "Blackbird," "Rocky Raccoon" and the rather notorious "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?" Harrison's four songs were the best of his career up to that point, especially the scathing "Piggies"; he would transcend even these offerings, though, with "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun" on "Abbey Road." Starr's "Don't Pass Me By" was slighter than the songs of his bandmates but still quite pleasant.The Beatles, as they always had, were not afraid to experiment with instrumentation, going far beyond the usual rock 'n' roll tools of guitars, bass and drums. Instruments on "The White Album," much of it played by the band members themselves but some contributed by session musicians, included piano, organ, harmonium, strings, brass, woodwinds and timpani.The album also featured one of the strangest "songs" in the Beatles canon, the sound-effect/spoken-word/musical montage "Revolution 9."I consider this to be a cornerstone album of my music collection. It's rich and kaleidoscopic; its stylistic diversity makes it an album that can be played over and over again. Highly recommended.

This is a review of the Japanese-import SACD version of the album.In short, it's great. I previously owned the DVD-Audio version of this surround mix but decided to sell it after it went out of print and prices skyrocketed. Unfortunately, I missed having the album in 5.1; fortunately, the SACD version is just terrific.In fact, it may even be better. The DVD-Audio was amazing, but I actually prefer the slightly softer feel of the SACD. The mix, as far as I know, is identical to the one that was done for DVD-A, but SACDs just seem to have a bit more warmth.Of course, you don't get the visual extras, which included some nice photos and one of the most attractive DVD-A menus I've ever seen. If your focus is the music, that obviously won't matter to you.And for those who don't remember or weren't around ... well, the Eagles were probably at the creative peak on this album. The title track, "New Kid in Town," "Life in the Fast Lane," Victim of Love," "Try and Love Again" and "The Last Resort" all became FM radio rock standards, and in fact were so overplayed in the 1970s and 1980s that some fans (myself included) needed a long break. But there's no denying the talent on display here. Drummer/singer Don Henley was at his swaggering best. Bassist Randy Meisner's songwriting contribution ("Try and Love Again") was the best of his career. Glenn Frey, Henley's most frequent writing partner, was often overshadowed in the band, both instrumentally and vocally, but his wistful vocal on "New Kid in Town" and wicked Clavinet on "Fast Lane" were superb. Finally, the dual leads of guitarists Joe Walsh and Don Felder just shredded everything in their path.Felder would later be dismissed by Henley and Frey, with the result being a legal mess. Walsh returned to the fold after many years, but my understanding is that, financially, he's never been a full partner. Tim Schmidt took over bass duties for Meisner after this record, playing on "The Long Run."The latter was a decent album, but it didn't stand up to its predecessor. There were a few great songs ("King of Hollywood," for example) but also a few too many few duds -- "Teenage Jail," the duh-hey "The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks.""Hotel California," by contrast, is the Eagles signature record. The 5.1 mix isolates the instruments beautifully; on every nearly every song, there is at least one moment that emerges as breathtaking:1. The separation of the acoustic and electric guitars on the title track, plus Henley's ghostly percussion.2. Walsh's first organ riff on "New Kid."3. The opening-note onslaught of the electric guitars on "Fast Lane."4. Henley's vocal on the final stanza of "Wasted Time"; he sounds both suitably exhausted and engaged.5. The clarity of the orchestra at the end of "Wasted Time (Reprise)."6. The ENTIRETY of "Victim of Love." On the runoff track of the original pressing of the album, the careful eye could find this message: "V.O.L. is five-piece live," meaning there were no studio overdubs. The performance of the song was spot-on and crackled with energy.7. Walsh's battered, nasal but somehow perfectly suitable voice on "Pretty Maids All in a Row."8. Meisner's entirely unbattered, stratospheric singing on "Try and Love Again."9. And finally, Frey's glorious but restrained piano on "The Last Resort"; on the 5.1 mix, you can actually hear the hammers striking the strings in one passage.Great album, great mix, and a great look back at one of the landmarks of 1970s rock.

"The Division Bell" is Pink Floyd's final studio album, or at least it is as of this writing in 2012 -- and with the death of keyboardist Rick Wright in 2008, it's likely there never will be a follow-up.As such, it stands as a very fine conclusion to the band's long, (inter)stellar ;) career. There are some tremendous songs here -- "Poles Apart," "Take It Back," "Keep Talking," "Lost for Words" and "High Hopes" are practically addictive -- and the band sounds far more like a band than on the preceding album, "A Momentary Lapse of Reason."On that album, guitarist David Gilmour was prominently featured, but Wright and drummer Nick Mason, for various reasons, were not; session drummers and keyboardists played many of the parts. Bassist Roger Waters had left the band after "The Final Cut"; the bass parts on "Momentary" were covered by Tony Levin.Mason and Wright perform on all the tracks on "The Division Bell," though, and the album was born partly out of jam sessions they enjoyed with Gilmour on his houseboat/recording studio, the Astoria. And while Levin is a great bassist, the Floyd by this time had found a better fit -- a young, incredibly talented player named Guy Pratt. Like Levin, he's a fluid, accomplished player, but his tone is a little more aggressive -- perfect for the Pink Floyd sound.I would not rank this album as high as "Dark Side of the Moon" or "Wish You Were Here," the two greatest albums in the Pink Floyd canon. Perhaps even "The Wall" and "Animals" rate somewhat higher for me. But "The Division Bell" stands up, over time, far better than, say, "Atom Heart Mother," "Ummagumma," "More" or "A Saucerful of Secrets."Part of the reason "The Division Bell" succeeds is the songwriting -- a great improvement in that department over "A Momentary Lapse of Reason." Gilmour writes or co-writes on 10 of the 11 songs here, while Wright has five songwriting credits.Perhaps the only major misstep here was to have Wright take the lead vocals on "Wearing the Inside Out." It's his only lead vocal on the album, and unfortunately, his voice by this time just wasn't up to the task.The final track here, "High Hopes," is as haunting and darkly beautiful as just about anything the Floyd ever recorded. Clocking in at just over eight and a half minutes, it features a church bell ringing on the fade-in over a sparse piano part played by second keyboardist Jon Carin; the rest of the band then comes in, including Gilmour on vocals and Wright on synthesizers. The lyrics -- which are about the inevitable disappointments, regrets and "slow decay" that aging brings -- yet express the lingering magic that living can bring, even if memories have become rather more powerful and meaningful than they should be:"The grass was greenerThe light was brighterThe taste was sweeterThe nights of wonderWith friends surroundedThe dawn mist glowingThe water flowingThe endless riverForever and ever..."Everyone who's lived a reasonable amount of time has felt such loss, the terrible realization that the past can, at times, feel more vivid than the present. But we also know it's an illusion. According to one old saying, youth is wasted on the young; our energies and bodies burn bright, but it is wisdom we lack. Wisdom, though, comes at a price -- the boundaries of one's life drawing in, the realization that we have made mistakes and cannot correct them; even if we are happy in later life, we might wonder at times what we would be had we chosen, at certain key points, different paths.Gilmour, with lyrical help from Polly Samson, whom he would marry the year "The Division Bell" was released, perfectly captures these feelings. As the last song on the last studio album by Pink Floyd, it needed to be rich in scope and right in its execution ... and indeed the whole band plays beautifully on it. What a way to end such a magnificent career.

"Pictures at an Exhibition" displays Emerson, Lake and Palmer at their most pretentious and ostentatious, but I mean that in the kindest way. Their rendering of the Russian classical composer Modest Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" is an over-the-top example of prog rock at its arrogant, exploratory best -- or worst, depending on your point of view. Here's what I mean by that: Purists are going to hate it, and by purists I mean people who are purist classical music fans and purist rock 'n' roll fans. Both camps include individuals who think the two forms just should not mix. But non-purists are going to recognize it for what it is: A rock band with extraordinary musical chops attacking a classic with a mixture of reverence and aggression.ELP consisted of keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist/guitarist/vocalist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer. Collectively, the three of them were interested in all kinds of music, from classical to folk to rock to jazz and even blues. Lake also wrote some lovely pieces in the singer/songwriter mode, such as "Still ... You Turn Me On" and "From the Beginning." Emerson had the strongest background in classical music, while Palmer was especially at ease playing jazz.Oddly, on this recording, Lake's performances stand out, which one would not expect, given that his focus lay elsewhere. Emerson and Palmer often drew a great deal of attention because they were both regarded as virtuosos on their respective instruments. But people then and now tend to forget what an accomplished musician Lake is, especially as an electric bassist. His growling, snarling undertones here may not be as flashy as the playing of his bandmates, but he drives the music very hard when that approach is called for.

"Cool Hand Luke" may be Paul Newman's best performance, although that's hard to say because he worked and worked well for a very long time. Whether it is or not, the film itself is incredible. Great supporting cast, too. No, it doesn't paint a pretty picture of the human condition, so if that's what you need in your movies, don't bother with this one. For those willing to deal with characters that are very, very flawed, yet interesting, "Luke" is an excellent choice. And this is NOT a hopeless film.

When "Full Metal Jacket" made its theatrical debut on June 26, 1987, many critics pounced on it. Stanley Kubrick, they asserted, had gone from being a great innovator to a follower. He was now behind the curve instead of out in front of it, as he'd always been, because so many Vietnam movies already had been released -- "Apocalypse Now," "The Deer Hunter" and "Platoon" among them. If Kubrick wasn't washed up, they seemed to be saying, he certainly was slipping down Has-Been Hill.There are so many things wrong with that stance that I would have trouble finding where to begin. But I will say this: Each of these films is its own world, and each is very much a product of its director's style and vision, and each does different things. "Apocalypse Now" is Francis Ford Coppola's take on the war, and it's the most surreal and deliberately absurd. Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" benefited from its significant focus on the home front during the war -- while the director did present the trauma suffered by soldiers, he also succeeded in depicting the hurts the war inflicted on loved ones, families, even an entire community. Oliver Stone's "Platoon" was, oddly, the most "realistic" of the four films, and in my opinion the least imaginative, though I still think it's a fine film.And then we have Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket." More than any of the other three films, it is a character study. The character in question is Joker, who has joined the Marine Corps, he claims, because he wants to kill. But there is much more to him; he is, in fact, a very sensitive individual and, compared with his peers, an intellectual who quotes Carl Jung and ponders "the duality of man."Many commentators have declared the film consists of two acts, but actually, it's a classic three-act structure. Act One is the boot camp sequence. Act Two follows Joker as he deals with his assignment as a military journalist. Act Three begins with the Tet Offensive, and ultimately forces Joker to give up his stance as journalist/observer in favor of soldier/participant.I do agree with people who say the first act of this film is so impressive and overwhelming that the rest of the picture can seem anti-climactic. Much of the reason lies with R. Lee Ermey, whos portrayal of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the most unforgettable performances in cinema history. Hartman's view, apparently, is that boot camp should be as hellish as possible, the better to prepare these would-be Marines from what they'll face in Vietnam. And the irony is he's right; it's just that he takes it to such an extreme that it results in two tragic deaths. Prior to that, though, Hartman unleashes upon his trainees a nonstop stream of profanity, verbal abuse, physical punishment and general humiliation.The result is a sequence that is both funny and horrible. Hartman is a brutal man, but his endless invective is laced with comments that one can't help but be amused by. Ermey was originally hired as a consultant on the film, and told Kubrick the original dialogue should be changed because it was unrealistic. Ermey, with the idea of playing the role of Hartman himself, performed part of the script to show Kubrick how he thought it should be done. Kubrick gave him the role.His favorite target is Leonard Lawrence, whom he calls "a disgusting fatbody," among other terms of endearment. Unfortunately, the slow-witted Leonard, or "Private Pyle," as Hartman calls him, cracks under the constant pressure.SPOILER ALERT! Skip the next paragraph if you haven't seen the film.Leonard shoots Hartman, then himself. The sole witness to the carnage is Joker.The film immediately shifts to Act Two, in Vietnam. Joker has attained the rank of sergeant and is a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes." Although he seems to like the job, he questions his superior about the euphemisms that are being used by U.S. forces to describe their actions in Vietnam. "Search and destroy," for example, becomes "sweep and clear."One of Joker's pals is Rafterman, a combat photographer who is frustrated with simply taking pictures; he wants to see the action, the front lines. Joker, who outranks him, basically tells him that, if he has his way, Rafterman won't get his chance. Rafterman's mother, Joker jokes, would do him physical harm when he returned to the States if he'd let anything happen to her son.Then comes the Tet Offensive, which changes both men's lives. The North Vietnamese attack on what is usually a holiday cease-fire. In the midst of the resulting carnage, Joker's superior orders him to go to Phu Bai to report on the situation. Rafterman asks to go with him; Joker tells his superior he doesn't want Rafterman along. His superior overrules him; Joker and Rafterman head for the combat zone.Act Three concerns their experiences on the battlefield. They meet up with a squad that includes Cowboy, who went through boot camp with Joker. Cowboy is now a sergeant. As the squad moves out on a patrol, accompanied by Joker and Rafterman, the squad leader is killed. Cowboy, now a sergeant, is ordered by headquarters to lead the platoon. In the sequence that follows, a sniper starts picking off members of the squad, one by one -- including Cowboy.The survivors finally find the sniper. And it is there, in the movie's penultimate scene, that Joker must face a moral choice -- or, more accurately, a dilemma, as there is no good choice to be made. Still, he must decide -- and makes a decision that surely will haunt him for years to come."Full Metal Jacket" ends with the Marine squad marching through the ravaged war zone, glad to be alive, singing the theme song to "The Mickey Mouse Club." It's one last, absurd commentary on the grim absurdity we call "war."This is a terrific film. Over the years, it has grown in stature, with critics and audiences alike finding more and more to like. I heartily recommend it.

I bought this album on vinyl when it came out in 1979. It was good then to see the Kinks finally start to get the recognition they deserved. The band had been around about as long as the Stones and the Who, and vocalist/rhythm guitarist Ray Davies was recognized by his peers for his great songwriting, but aside from "You Really Got Me," "Lola," "Rock and Roll Fantasy" and "Celluloid Heroes," the group never completely captured the ear of the American record-buying public. I remember, in fact, having to explain to a friend that Van Halen's "You Really Got Me" was a cover version!All that changed, at least temporarily, when the Kinks released "Low Budget" in '79. It wasn't that the band started pandering; far from it. They were writing and recording the same tough/tender songs they'd always offered -- but this album was timely in a way that previous albums hadn't been. For one thing, several of the songs reflected the difficult economic times, including the title track, "National Health" and especially "A Gallon of Gas," the Kinks' response to the several energy crises of that decade. For another, the music demonstrated an awareness of then-current trends without really being "trendy." Yes, "Pressure" had the breakneck, runaway quality that was driving punk, and "(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman" and "Catch Me Now I'm Falling" certainly exploited the disco beat that was so prevalent at the time (the Kinks even released extended mixes of both songs).But you weren't going to hear Dave Davies' crunching, menacing guitar sounds on a Donna Summer or Village People record. The Kinks on "Low Budget" managed to have their cake and eat it, too, blending catchy pop elements with the harder rock sounds that had been part of the band's roots from the very beginning.Most importantly of all, "Low Budget" was fun and FUNNY. Ray Davies' songwriting (and Dave's, for that matter) always had demonstrated considerable wit, and this disc was no exception. To this day, it's one hell of a lot of fun to listen to this album, and it really doesn't sound dated, either. Highly recommended.

Time will tell you lies -- or at least distort things if you're not careful. With films, especially, this can be true; I've recently watched a few films that I saw in my youth and liked to see if they could stand up to scrutiny in middle age -- and most of them didn't.Some exceptions: "Jaws," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and "Taxi Driver."I may get some argument on this, but I think "Taxi Driver" might be Martin Scorsese's greatest work. It has everything -- a great plot, incredible acting, and despite it being a harrowing, dark film, it has elements that are eye and ear candy. Especially ear candy: "Taxi Driver" and Brian de Palma's "Obsession" were the last two scores from the great Bernard Hermann, who had written so many incredible pieces for Alfred Hitchcock. Hermann's work on "Taxi Driver" really helps ratchet up the tension, and does so without being especially "edgy" or, worse yet, pretentious. From blaring brass to softer woodwinds to, at times, just a simple percussive beat, the music helps draw you into main character Travis Bickle's lonely, twisted world.Of course, it's also easier to make a great film when you have great actors, and Scorsese really had them on this shoot, including Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Cybill Shepherd, and Peter Boyle as Wizard, another whacked-out cabbie who at first seems just sane enough to try to mentor Travis -- until you realize that, despite his "Wizard" moniker, there's just no "there" there.The ending of this film will haunt me forever. And each time I see it, it seems to play differently. THAT is art -- any work that seems to reveal more of itself to you, every time you read, hear or see it.

For my money -- and heaven knows I've spent it on this album, owning or having owned probably ten different copies in various formats since the mid-1970s -- "Who's Next" is The Who's greatest work, and also one of the top five classic rock albums of all time. Give me this one, plus Led Zeppelin's "Physical Graffiti," the Rolling Stones' "Beggar's Banguet," The Beatles' "White Album" and Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," then come see me on my desert island in five years. Musically speaking, at least, I won't have reached boredom stage yet.The original issue of this album, with just the nine songs from "Baba O'Riley" to "Won't Get Fooled Again," was killer. Guitarist Pete Townshend had discovered synthesizers, but instead of falling prey to the kind of syrupy goo other people were doing with the instruments, Townshend used his new toys to create rhythmic pulses or subtle colorings. The result was still rock 'n' roll, but a new kind of rock that soared into musical landscapes unimaginable back in the era of Fats Domino and Chubby Checker.Now, here's all you need to know about the Deluxe Edition: It isn't nonsense. The additional tracks aren't just filler -- they're all good, and many of them are amazing, like "Naked Eye." They add to the set by showing that Townshend's songwriting at the time had reached new levels. He was working at the very top of his game -- even if the Who as a band didn't manage to turn all these songs into the planned rock opera Pete was calling "Lifehouse."This is essential stuff. Highly, highly recommended.

Pete Townshend, at his peak, was the greatest rock writer of his time. Better than Lennon/McCartney, better than Jagger/Richards, better than the Kinks' Ray Davies even though Townshend himself once said otherwise. I am saying at his PEAK, roughly from "Tommy" through "Who's Next," "Quadrophenia," "Who By Numbers" and "Who Are You." After Keith Moon died, Townshend's commitment to the Who wavered even more severely than it had in the glory years. But that's another story."Another Scoop" is a fine follow-up to the demo collection he offered "Scoop," featuring Townshend shoulda-been classics such as "Ask Yourself" and darker ruminations such as "The Ferryman." For the uninitiated: All three "Scoop" collections gather home-recorded "demonstration" or "demo" versions of the songs Townshend has written over the years, many of which (but not all!) went on to be recorded by the Who.The DVD-Audio version deserves special notice (that's the product I'm reviewing here). Actually, it's one of Classic Records' DADs, or Digital Audio Discs. Essentially, it's a two-sided disc -- one side will be play back on DVD-Video machines, the other side only on DVD-Audio machines or newer combi players (I have a Yamaha BD player that also plays DVD-A and SACD). The audio mixes on this disc are NOT surround, so if that's what you're seeking, don't bother. They are higher-resolution stereo mixes, with the mix on the DVD-A side being the highest available in this package.Personally, I liked hearing Townshend's demos in the high-quality stereo, rather than surround, format. These songs, elaborate as some of the recordings are, were meant to be sketches -- and what marvelous sketches they are.

I hadn't listened to this in more than a decade; I bought it when I was a teen-ager and, even though I was a Yes fan, thought, "This is just ... TOO strange." Hauled it out recently intending to purge it from my collection and thought I'd listen one more time. Danged if I'm not keeping it! Anderson was way ahead of his time; I can see that now. "Meeting/Sound Out the Galleon" features a percussive backing track that predates most of the so-called "sophisticated" world music our ears have grown used to in the last decade or so. Sure, the album has its impossibly precious, twee moments, but that's Anderson. Overall, I just can't believe this was recorded back in the 1970s.Plus: The JOY in this music is undeniable. I'm glad I gave this one another chance. It's still not on a par with the best Yes solo outing of all time -- that would be bassist Chris Squire's "Fish Out of Water." But this is the close second -- far better than, say, Steve Howe's ill-conceived, absolutely BORING "Beginnings." Bravo, Jon! Sign me up for interstellar passage on the Moorglade!

"Relics" is a compilation of songs from various Pink Floyd albums and also includes a couple previously unreleased odds and ends. Like all PF compilations, it suffers from comparison with the band's highly conceptual studio albums.But "Relics" also has the distinction of serving as a document of the transition between the Pink Floyd led by founding guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Syd Barrett and his friend and replacement, David Gilmour. Several of the songs on this disc are from the Barrett era, including "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play," two of the finest singles -- and finest songs -- he ever wrote.Other tracks, such as the ominous "Careful With That Axe, Eugene," show the somewhat darker direction Pink Floyd took in the early days with Gilmour.Overall, this is an interesting collection, but those who really want to know what Syd Barrett was all about probably should just pick up the recently remastered "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," the band's debut. Barrett is all over it, dominating the proceedings completely.

Perhaps "Meddle" should have been called "Almost" instead. Although Pink Floyd would record one more album before tackling "Dark Side of the Moon" (the film soundtrack "Obscured by Clouds"), "Meddle" is the only pre-"Dark Side" album that really sounds of a piece with that record and the band's later works.Yes, this disc did include a (vinyl) sidelong work, just like the "Atom Heart Mother" album did. But "Echoes" is much more focused and structured -- a song that clearly was WRITTEN and not just slapped together. From the opening, pinging, distorted piano note to the howling noise at the end, it's no less than hypnotic. The lyrics do sound a bit dated these days, but they're still the best lyrics the post-Syd Barrett band had written up to that time.The other side of the album featured songs of much more conventional length. The opener was the ferocious "One of these Days," featuring not one but two aggressive bass guitars (one with newer strings that sounded growlier, the other with old strings that sounds more thuddy/boomy). "A Pillow of Winds" was a great, evocative, atmospheric ballad. "Fearless" is one of my favorite Floyd tracks -- it's driven mostly by acoustic guitars, and the rather pugnacious lyrics definitely give the song and edgy quality. But it's the soccer fans near the end, chanting "You'll Never Walk Alone," that push the track from menacing to downright eerie. The side concludes with some decidedly lightweight pop in the form of "St. Tropez" and what may be the dumbest song in the PF canon, "Seamus," which features a dog or two howling along with the music.Of all the Floyd albums between "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" and "Dark Side," "Meddle" is the most tuneful, most listenable, most downright enjoyable. Recommended.

I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not ... I've never been thrilled with "The Final Cut" or, for that matter, "A Momentary Lapse of Reason." The former is really a Roger Waters solo album masquerading as a PF album not long before he left the band. The latter is David Gilmour's baby, and while it's got some interesting music, lacks Waters' lyrical inventiveness.Then there's the Syd Barrett-led Floyd from 1968 or so, which only produced one album, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn." Barrett was a brilliant songwriter, or was most of the time; "Astronomy Domine" is brilliant, as are some other tracks here. But "Interstellar Overdrive" bores the daylights out of me, and some of the other psychedelic overtones here result in this being an album that has not aged especially gracefully.After Barrett's drug use/madness drove him from the group, the band struggled through a few somewhat uninspired albums, including "A Saucerful of Secrets" and the "More" film soundtrack. "Meddle" and "Obscured by Clouds," the two albums released just before "Dark Side," hinted at some really good things to come.Then came the Floyd albums that defined the band for me: "Dark Side of the Moon," "Wish You Were Here," "Animals" and "The Wall." Each of them quite different from the rest, each of them with its own considerable merits. "Animals" was about as noisy as the Floyd ever got, and "Sheep" and "Dogs" especially were great fun for their musical bite and lyrical nastiness. "The Wall" is probably the creepiest album of the four, and the one I identify with least ... but then again, I've never been a rock star who's coming apart at the mental seams. That leaves "Dark Side" and "Wish You Were Here," and over the decades I've vacillated between the two when trying to decide which is Pink Floyd's best album.So ... as I said, I'm a Floyd fanatic, or maybe I'm not. I will say this: I don't appreciate being sold a box set as expensive as the Dark Side "Immersion" box that has so many packaging problems. I was absolutely HORRIFIED when I saw the contents of my first copy. The two discs in cardboard sleeves were fine, but the four that were supposed to be on spindles had ALL come loose during shipping. Two were badly scraped and scratched, and the other two showed slight damage.I am glad I ordered from amazon. I let them know via the Web site about the problems; they shipped out a new copy almost immediately. Out of caution, though, I held onto the first one until the second arrived, and it's a good thing I did: Again, the discs had slipped off their spindles, or in this case three of them had. Fortunately, using the two sets, I was able to piece together four good discs, not counting the ones in sleeves, and shipped the worst of the lot back.This just shouldn't happen with a set this expensive, but at least the retailer made good on it. I've also read some pretty scathing criticisms of the 2011 vinyl version of DSOTM, so maybe it is true that quality control on this whole project wasn't what it should have been.As for the contents: I was very, very skeptical that anything here could surpass the 2003 SACD mixed for 5.1 by James Guthrie. Indeed, the disc labeled DVD-Audio didn't come close, in my opinion, or rather, just didn't sound to me like there was any noticeable improvement. I'm a surround geek; my system plays SACDs, DVD-Audio discs and blu-rays, including blu-ray audio. I've listened to a lot of surround mixes over the years despite the general failure of such formats in the marketplace.Without expecting much, I listened to the blu-ray audio disc included in the Immersion Box. I must say it has its own merits. As one of the band members points out in the 2003 documentary (I think it was Rick Wright), there are tubular bells on "Brain Damage." I have good ears but I'd never heard them, even on the SACD version. I played back the DVD-A version of "Brain Damage" included here; still didn't ring any bells. But the blu-ray did. They're very faint, but I can hear them. And overall, the blu-ray mix is very, very good. Basic difference for me: I think the lows and mid-range are slightly superior on the SACD, with the highs being clearer on the blu-ray mix.That still wouldn't be enough for me to award this box four stars despite its shoddy packaging. But the inclusion of the quad mixes and Alan Parsons' alternate mix are definitely interesting to hear.You've got to be pretty crazy for the Floyd to buy this, but for those interested in the history and development of this album, there's enough here. Now, back to that packaging issue: Thank God, the powers that be corrected the problems with the Immersion version of "Wish You Were Here."

I don't know -- maybe I wasn't expecting enough. I had heard DSOTM soooo many times over the years that I really didn't think the SACD mix would thrill, startle and amaze me the way it has."Dark Side of the Moon" was a sonic feast even before it got the 5.1 treatment. Even after 38 years, its blend of music and sound effects still seems innovative. Lots of bands have tried to do this kind of thing; few have succeeded like the Floyd did. "Speak To Me," "On the Run," "Time," "The Great Gig in the Sky," "Money," "Us and Them," "Brain Damage" and "Eclipse" depend not only on the fine music they display but also FX or spoken snatches of dialogue. Only "Breathe" and "Any Colour You Like" depend almost entirely on the musical content itself.Anyway, the 5.1 mix is just ... absolutely ... astonishing. The producers have done well by this album: The sound effects move through the mix when NECESSARY, drifting and turning from speaker to speaker in a way that enhances the songs instead of detracting from them.And the sound never has been cleaner. EVERY previous mix/copy of DSOTM I've owned, I've been able to hear some slight distortion in Rick Wright's keyboards, especially on "Time." Not here. FINALLY, a mix that lives up to the album's genius.

"Atom Heart Mother" does not rank high in the Pink Floyd canon. It lacks the focus of their later work, including the melodic punch of "Dark Side of the Moon" and the rangier but still controlled pulse of "Wish You Were Here."Yet it's an important album, because this is the record on which the Floyd began to find its footing after losing one of its founding members, guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Syd Barrett, to the ravages of mental illness that was possibly exacerbated by drug use.After the early glory of the Barrett-led "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," PF had released "A Saucerful of Secrets," "More" and "Ummagumma." Each of those albums had its distinct problems -- for more information, see my reviews of each. It wasn't until "Atom Heart" that the post-Barrett Pink Floyd began to sound sure of its direction. "Atom Heart," in fact, provided a blueprint the Floyd would follow on almost every subsequent album; it offered a long piece, a somewhat long piece, and several shorter, more "personal" compositions.The title track, in the original vinyl configuration, took up the entirety of Side One. It's an ambitious piece of music, with the four members of the band being augmented by an orchestra and choir. In places, it sounds absolutely majestic -- there's definitely a classical feel here, but you can also tell it's a rock band providing the pulse. Unfortunately, it has significant timing problems. Bassist Roger Waters and drummer Nick Mason slow down and speed up, and guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Rick Wright basically follow them over the various tempo cliffs.Side Two offers some interesting songs. Waters' "If" is a lovely ballad, musically speaking, although the lyrics are much harder-edged, with references to insanity that would resurface and intensify by the time he would begin working on the lyrics for "Dark Side of the Moon." Rick Wright's "Summer '68" is definitely of its time; you can practically smell the cannabis and incense, but it's a tuneful, enjoyable piece of pop craftsmanship. David Gilmour's "Fat Old Sun" begins very gently but builds as Gilmour starts layering in the electric guitar parts. And the album concludes with the group composition "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast," which I loved when I was a teen-ager but find rather annoying now. The voice-overs that would seem so pithy and poignant on "Dark Side" are, here, just grating -- I really don't need to hear some English chap musing about how much he likes marmalade, or how his back hurts him when he works.This isn't an album I listen to very much anymore, but Floyd fans without much knowledge of the band's distant past might enjoy hearing it. And, again, it's an important transitional work, paving the way for "Meddle," on which the Floyd would perfect many of the concepts here.

"A Saucerful of Secrets" is vastly overrated by many Pink Floyd fans. The truth is that the band's second album was marred by a paucity of fresh songwriting. This wasn't a surprise to followers of the group at the time; the Floyd had lost co-founder and guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Syd Barrett to an ugly, debilitating collision of mental illness and excessive drug use. He was replaced by David Gilmour, an equally capable vocalist and, actually, a better guitar player -- but Gilmour, at the time, lacked Barrett's imaginative songwriting skills. Bassist Roger Waters and keyboardist Rick Wright were striving to contribute; drummer Nick Mason has never been a strong songwriting force in the band.In short, Barrett had written most of the Floyd's material, and without him, the rest of the band seemed kind of lost. (One Barrett track, "Jugband Blues," does appear on "Saucerful," but it's not Barrett's best work.) Of the seven tracks on "Saucerful," Waters writes three on his own -- "Let There Be More Light," "Corporal Clegg" and "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun," and only the latter track makes a strong impression, with its menacing, rumbling tone. Wright's "Remember a Day" and "See-Saw" are pleasant enough, musically speaking, but, ultimately, forgettable. The group-composed title track is a longer, more ambitious piece, but it just doesn't seem to go anywhere. The best Floyd music always has been a kind of aural journey, and this piece simply doesn't know what it wants to be.Still, "Saucerful" has some nice moments, and was proof the Floyd could soldier on without Barrett. And it wouldn't be long before the glory days of "Dark Side of the Moon" and "Wish You Were Here."

I know some people rate this record very highly, but I can't join the chorus on this one. "More" is one of the slightest, most inconsequential albums Pink Floyd ever recorded. It was a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film, and in its original vinyl configuration, Side Two consisted mostly of forgettable instrumentals. Side One was better, with three tracks written by bassist Roger Waters that were rather engaging -- "Cirrus Minor," "Green is the Colour" and "Cymbaline." Overall, though, this album rarely rises above mediocre, and suffers the same fault many movie soundtrack albums suffer -- the work comes off as "incidental music" that, when separated from the film, simply does not stand up on its own.

"Ummagumma" was, for a long time, a personal favorite of mine; as I've aged, the album has sounded less and less relevant to me.It originally consisted of two vinyl discs. The first featured four live performances from the band -- "Astronomy Domine," "Careful With That Axe, Eugene," "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" and "A Saucerful of Secrets" -- and overall it was terrific. The second disc featured four segments in which each band member was to do pretty much whatever he wanted.Of the four, only Roger Waters seems to have developed enough as a writer at the time to pull this off -- his "Grantchester Meadows" was a languid but compelling aural home movie, which flowed into one of the strangest tracks ever on a Floyd album: "Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict." Keyboardist Rick Wright's "Sysyphus" was a 12-minute opus featuring lots of rumbling, low pianos and strange tones; it was frequently quite compelling and listenable, but droned on a bit too long. David Gilmour's "The Narrow Way" ... well, Gilmour himself later admitted he was just muddling along here (I'd like to quote him directly, but amazon wouldn't allow such language). Nick Mason's "The Grand Vizier's Garden Party" featured his drumming along with some flute played by his then-wife, Lindy, and lots of odd sound effects.I rarely listen to "Ummagumma" all the way through these days, but on occasion I will listen to the live half. The version of "Astronomy Domine" -- which had been written by Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett -- is just amazing here, very energetic and quite spooky.

Pink Floyd was still finding its way upon release of this early effort. Syd Barrett was gone by this point, and his replacement, singer/guitarist David Gilmour, was a stronger musician and vocalist but a lesser songwriter. Fortunately, the format for this album de-emphasized songwriting in favor of live performance of mostly previous material on disc 1 and studio experimentation on disc 2. The live half of the album is dynamite -- GREAT, cosmic, driving, forceful takes of Barrett's "Astronomy Domine" and the eerie "Careful With That Axe, Eugene." Disc 2 ... well, it doesn't quite hang together, but then, it wasn't really meant to do so anyway. Each band member gets half a (vinyl) side to do his stuff. Rick Wright's "Sisyphus" is probably the most musically thought out, but there's more structure here than inspiration. Gilmour later scoffed at his effort, "The Narrow Way," though the piece is well-executed, if thin on ideas. Nick Mason's drum workout "The Grand Vizier's Garden Party," has some nice moments, mixing percussion with sound effects and suggesting what would come later when the idea was fully realized on "Dark Side of the Moon." Finally, bassist Roger Waters turns in a wonderful, nostalgic song, "Grantchester Meadows," marred only by his rather weak vocal. And that leaves us with the notorious "Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict," an uproarious FX-laden riff featuring animal noises and a nearly Neolithic rant. Hmm ... I used to love playing this one for people who were in an, um, ALTERED state and watching them freak. But in the end, it's a novelty song. Still, overall, "Ummagumma" was a powerful suggestion of the colossus the Floyd would become just a few years later. Definitely still worth a listen, but not essential, either.

"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" was Pink Floyd's debut album, and the man behind the guitar and main vocal mic at the time was a pleasant, charming fellow named Roger "Syd" Barrett. He wrote most of the material, and his songs, unlike later PF songs that made good use of the melancholy and the menacing, were rooted in whimsy and English folklore.This is, of course, an essential album for the Floyd completist, and also will be of interest to those with a strong interest in the band, especially in how it sounded before Barrett blew his mind in a haze of drugs, most notably LSD. Barrett already seemed prone to depressive episodes -- and when a person like that starts gobbling acid, the results tend not to be good.Barrett performs on a few songs on the follow-up to this album, "A Saucerful of Secrets," but by that time, guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour was also on board. For a brief time, the Floyd was a five-piece band, but the idea of having Barrett mostly stay home and write songs -- a la Brian Wilson's situation with the Beach Boys at one time -- didn't work out. Bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Rick Wright were all, to varying degrees, frustrated with Barrett's erratic behavior.But those troubles all came to the fore AFTER "Piper" was written and recorded. Barrett did make a couple of solo albums after his PF days, but they are rambling, disjointed affairs, very much an acquired taste, if the taste for them can be acquired at all. "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" is his masterpiece.Barrett's "Astronomy Domine" kicks off the album, and it's a small masterpiece of its own -- a fairly concise slice of "space rock" complete with trippy interplanetary lyrics and some very fine vocals by Barrett and Wright. Also strong (all of these songs composed by Barrett): "Lucifer Sam," "Chapter 24," "The Scarecrow" and "Bike." The two band-composed pieces are "Pow R. Toc H." and "Interstellar Overdrive." I've never been able to make much sense of the former, but the latter is a long, driving instrumental that goes on for too long but definitely has its moments. Roger Waters would come to dominate PF's songwriting in later years; his only solo composition here is "Take Up They Stethoscope and Walk," and next to Barrett's songs, it sounds very pedestrian.A note on the above: The discussion is relevant only to the UK version of the album, which is now the standard release. The original US version was annoying in the extreme -- it omitted "Astronomy Domine," "Flaming" and "Bike" altogether; added the single "See Emily Play"; and shuffled the running order of the other nine songs to no apparent purpose.A note on the 40th-anniversary, 3-CD limited edition: It contains stereo and mono mixes of the album, for one thing -- and some people strongly prefer the mono mix, without the oh-that's-so-Sixties panning of the stereo mix. Until recently, the stereo mix was always my preference, but spending time with this deluxe edition finally made me change my mind -- the single-channel mix is just so up and in your face that it has an energy level untouched by any other version. The third CD features all of the Floyd's singles from 1967, including the excellent "See Emily Play" and "Arnold Layne," plus a few alternate takes.Buy this album if you think you'll enjoy hearing a truly different Pink Floyd. Don't buy it if you're so attached to the way the band sounded later on that you can't make room for something else. I do have some very knowledgeable musical friends who say they simply can't listen to this. But my personal view is there is some very strong music here -- and Barrett's lyrics were in a class by themselves.

Like "More," "Obscured by Clouds" is a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film -- "The Valley," in this case. Unlike "More," the members of Pink Floyd clearly were ready for such a task, as this record is far superior.That's true even though -- again like "More" -- "Obscured by Clouds" features a number of instrumentals; of the 10 tracks here, only six have lyrics, with the rest being instrumentals. But the Floyd by this time had learned how to create atmosphere, so that even the instrumentals are evocative. Especially good along those lines: The title track, "Mudmen" and "Absolutely Curtains," the latter of which does feature a vocal chant by the Mapuga tribespeople.But the songs with vocals are the most developed, and nearly every one of the four is very good. Exceptionally noteworthy is the haunting "Burning Bridges," composed by guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Rick Wright; they share vocals on the song. Also deserving of merit is bassist Roger Waters' "Free Four." Yes, lines like "the memories of a man in his old age / are the deeds of a man in his prime" can seem a bit quaint now, but this is one of Waters' early songs about losing his father -- a theme that would resurface on "The Wall" and really resonate on "The Final Cut."I also like Gilmour's "Childhood's End," inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name.Overall, this is a very fine effort from the Floyd. Certainly it doesn't hold together as well as the concept albums that would follow, but it's still a very worthy collection of songs.

With the possible exceptions of "Shine On," "Echoes" and "Oh, by the Way...", most Pink Floyd compilations have ended up sounding irrelevant instead of revealing. One reason for this is that the band over the years has developed such strong concept albums that taking songs out of context generally did more harm than good. "Shine On" gets a pass from me because the material was remastered and the packaging absolutely superb. "Echoes" used that classic PF tool, the segue, to create a compelling mix of songs from the band's career. And "Oh, by the Way" collects all the Floyd's 14 studio albums for completists and newbies."Works" is a better collection of songs than that found on "A Collection of Great Dance Songs, and possibly even "Relics." But overall, it's a yawner. The only thing of real interest here is the rarely-heard "Embryo." If you're going to buy this album, I recommend a cheapie used version.

Of the four albums in the Brian Eno canon that are specifically labeled "ambient," this one may be the most beautiful. Released in 1980, two years after "Ambient 1: Music For Airports," this was not an Eno solo record but rather his collaboration with pianist Harold Budd. Yet the minimalist ethos is still very much in place.These songs are very soft and reflective. Budd sticks mostly to acoustic piano but does play electric on a couple of the pieces. Eno's main role is to "treat," or sonically alter in subtle ways, the songs, although he does add some synthesizer to some of the work. In some cases, Eno merely (I say "merely," but his contributions are hardly insignificant) reverses the melody that Budd has composed, but the result is a totally different feel for that particular piece of music.I played this once for my fiance and her visiting friend, very late at night; we were living in an apartment with very thin walls at the time and wanted to make sure our music didn't disturb the neighbors. I remember the friend stopping in the middle of our hushed conversation to listen intently -- the piece playing at that moment was "An Arc of Doves." She sat motionless for the rest of the song, then whispered, "My God, but that's beautiful."It still is.

I must begin by taking issue with some of the more negative reviews here. No, "Black Easter" is not a modern horror novel, or slasher film, or gore-fest. It was first published in serial form in 1968 (in "If" magazine) under the title "Faust Aleph-null." So, first things first, let's give this fine piece of writing its due ESPECIALLY since it is, as of this writing, forty-four years old. Some reviewers here have complained that it's not shocking now. Well, neither, I suppose, is Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House," but it's a marvelously creepy ghost story nonetheless. And, like that book, give "Black Easter" a chance and it just might make your neck hairs stand up a bit.The premise here is that an arms dealer contracts with a practitioner of black magic, the aim being to loose all the demons of hell upon the Earth for one night -- JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. What happens, unfortunately, is Armageddon; once loosed, the legion of demons cannot be whisked back to the underworld.Some who've complained that "Black Easter" seems short and incomplete should know that there's a good reason for that: Blish considered it to be merely the first half of a novel, the other half being "The Day After Judgement." In 1990, a small publishing house called Gregg Press finally released the two novellas as the single novel Blish had intended, under the title "The Devil's Day." Presented in that way, both "Easter" and "Judgement" seem whole, and the entire story arc just makes more sense.Both "Easter" and "Judgement" are worth reading. True, even for me they don't pack the punch they did when I first read them as a teenager in the 1970s. But still, there are some very dark, disturbing concepts here. Essentially, Blish is writing about the terrible price that experience and knowledge can extract from a person, even to the point of destruction.And in fact, if the two books are considered as one book under the title of "The Devil's Day," then another of Blish's claims holds water: He considered this the final book of a trilogy about the price of knowledge, with the first novel being 1959's "A Case of Conscience" and the second being "Dr. Mirabilis," published in 1964. His title for the trilogy was "After Such Knowledge," a phrase pulled from the writings of T.S. Eliot.Those first two books do not share the same character set that appears in "Easter" and "Judgement" or, if you prefer, "The Devil's Day." But if you're going to read "Black Easter," I would definitely pick up a copy of "The Day After Judgement" and read the two novellas back to back as a single novel, as Blish intended. They are fascinating books, their central question being, "What would happen if good were NOT necessarily stronger than evil?"Finally, I do agree that Blish as a writer can be a bit problematic -- especially annoying is his tendency at times to tell rather than show. But in his best passages here, he presents a world both fascinating and repellent, an Earth awash in wickedness unleashed not with great malice but simply recklessness.

"The Pretender" is not my favorite collection of Jackson Browne SONGS -- I reserve that honor to its predecessor, "Late for the Sky." But "The Pretender" just may be the best album of Browne's career, because he pulls together every element that has made him successful. Yes, songwriting is a big part of that, but so is his distinctive voice, his production values, and the musicians he chooses to play with on any given project.First, the songwriting here: It's very, very good, almost on a par with "Late for the Sky." In fact, the entirety of side one (using old vinyl terminology) is tremendous, from the tense opening notes of "The Fuse" to the acoustic-guitar swing of "Your Bright Baby Blues" to the two absolute heartbreakers "Linda Paloma" and "Here Come Those Tears Again." Side two starts off shakily, with the fairly weak "The Only Child," but recovers nicely with "Daddy's Tune." I've always had mixed feelings about "Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate" -- it's pretty moribund, even for the melancholy Browne, but it works beautifully as a prelude to the title track, "The Pretender," which closes the album on nothing less than an anthemic note. It is, in fact, one of Browne's greatest songs, as it somehow manages to celebrate the potential but also mourn the limitations of human existence.The vocals: Browne's first three albums were well-sung, but on none of them did he display the vocal power and confidence he would project on "The Pretender." I suspect that working with Bruce Springsteen producer Jon Landau helped, as Landau certainly knew how to accentuate Springsteen's vocal strengths. But much of the credit has to go to Browne himself; he just seems determined with this album to up the vocal ante.Finally, the musicianship: Browne had always played with top musicians and sung with great harmony vocalists, but the credits on "The Pretender" read like mid-1970s rock royalty. Roy Bittan, pianist from Springsteen's E Street Band, contributed, as did Little Feat guitarist Lowell George. But the most important players on "The Pretender" are the drummers -- former Derek and the Dominos member Jim Gordon, Toto co-founder Jeff Porcaro and session man Russ Kunkel. The latter had played on previous Browne albums, but his touch is heavier here -- and Gordon and Porcaro were well-known for being able to play somewhat aggressively without overwhelming the artist's approach. Together, the three of them gave this album more punch and vitality than Browne's previous work had displayed.Browne followed up "The Pretender" with "Running on Empty," a very likable collection of tunes recorded on the road, some in front of live audiences, others in hotel and practice rooms, and one ("Nothing But Time") on a tour bus. That album's loose feel almost seems a reaction to the tight structure of "The Pretender," and was clearly a direction Browne needed to explore. But despite the popularity of "Running on Empty," "The Pretender" has worn much better over the years.

At the time of its release, "No Country for Old Men" stood as the best adaptation ever of a novel by Cormac McCarthy. That distinction probably belongs now to "The Road," but that doesn't change the fact that "No Country" is an amazing film.There are many, many triumphs here, from the cinematography to the screenplay to the direction to the performances by virtually every cast member -- everything about this movie rings true. Over it all, though, arches the performance of Tommy Lee Jones. He's hard not to like as an actor anyway, but here, he's simply off the charts. Even his opening voice-over will make the neck hairs stand up.I highly recommend this film.

"The Final Cut" is the most depressing album Pink Floyd ever recorded -- and with a repertoire that includes "The Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wall," that's saying something.It's also not necessarily a bad thing. True art does not necessarily depend on happy conclusions or chuckles or a generally sunny outlook on life -- in fact, many artists' works matter because they address the human condition's darker side, from depression to anger to suffering.In the case of "The Final Cut," though, the proceedings can get downright grim. Essentially, it's an anti-war album, which is just fine. It was inspired in part by the Falklands War of the early 1980s, which many in the UK and elsewhere saw as downright gratuitous on Britain's part, as GB sought to retake the rather bleak, sparsely populated Falkland Islands back from the invading Argentinians (writer Jorge Luis Borges characterized the conflict as "a fight between two bald men over a comb"). The Argentinians may have been the aggressors, but to Waters and other opponents of Margaret Thatcher's conservative government, Great Britain's response was over the top.The other inspiration for the album was the death of Waters' father, Eric Fletcher Waters, in World War II. Unfortunately, Waters had made use of this subject in "The Wall," and to many Floyd fans, this loss on the bassist's part -- genuine as it was -- was wearing a little thin as grist for the PF creative mill.My judgment of the album: Lyrically, it has moments of absolute brilliance. An example from the title song:"Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyesI can barely define the shape of this moment in timeAnd far from flying high in clear blue skiesI'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide."And from "The Gunner's Dream":"Floating down through the cloudsMemories come rushing up to meet me now.In the space between the heavensand in the corner of some foreign fieldI had a dream."Waters' gifts as a lyricist are undeniable. Rarely can rock lyrics be quoted out of context of the music without seeming a bit silly, but on "The Final Cut," Waters had reached a point at which his lyrical skills were approaching those of Bob Dylan.Musically, "The Final Cut" is far less satisfying. Essentially, it sounds like a warmed-over "The Wall," with many of the musical themes echoing that album. And the sound effects! On many Floyd records, including the classic "Dark Side of the Moon" and "Wish You Were Here," the FX played a crucial part, helping to underscore the songs' lyrical themes. Unfortunately, "The Final Cut" is just awash in them, to the point that the band was teetering on the edge of self-parody.Finally, Waters was the lead vocalist on all tracks except "Not Now John," and Waters' style over the years leading up to this album had grown increasingly strident. Guitarist David Gilmour always had shouldered a large part of the vocal parts, but this time, he's barely present.Fortunately, his guitar parts still shine as one of the band's defining elements. Drummer Nick Mason, though, gets booted from the drum chair on at least one song, "Two Suns in the Sunset" (played by session drummer Andy Newmark), and rumor over the years has had it that he doesn't play on several other tracks, either."The Final Cut" will never be one of my favorite Floyd albums. Gilmour, who has criticized it over the years, is right -- the music simply isn't up to the high standards the Floyd had set for itself. But the album's lyrics and strong concept do give it considerable merit.

After all this time, I guess I should be able to avoid being disappointed when a record company lies to me; unfortunately, it still stings, more than 40 years after I started buying albums.This is a review of the hybrid SACD version of "Schoolboys in Disgrace." Look, I LOVE the album itself; it's one of the Kinks' best -- funny, irreverent, nostalgic, all at once. And very musical -- the guitars, keys, vocals, bass and drum parts here are just wonderful in every way. However, it was very disappointing to put the disc in my SACD player and search in vain for the surround layer. It clearly says, on the back cover, that this release includes an "SACD Surround Sound" layer, meaning it should play in 5.1-channel format.Nope. If it had that layer, "Multi Channel In" should come up as an option on my Denon receiver, and it doesn't.Well, I was suspicious before I ever played the thing -- reason being that the rest of the reissues in this Kinks SACD series all seem to be stereo-only. They're labeled as such on "Misfits," "Sleepwalker" and "Everybody's In Showbiz." Buyer beware: I also bought the live album, "One More For the Road," which is also labeled as surround; like "Schoolboys," it isn't.And just for the record, MFSL's SACD of "Low Budget" is stereo-only as well, although it is correctly labeled as such.Be nice if they fixed this labeling problem on "Schoolboys" and "Road." I really have nothing against two-channel SACDs, but it would be nice to know what I'm getting.

"Going for the One" was a brilliant return to form for Yes, and a necessary one, too -- without this 1977 album and the new pathway it provided for the band to move forward, I think it's entirely possible Yes would have broken up.Yes had had some amazing successes at the time this album was recorded. "The Yes Album," "Fragile" and "Close to the Edge" were, each and every one, monumental art rock classics. From the tough-minded riffing of "Yours Is No Disgrace" on "The Yes Album" to the FM hit "Roundabout" on "Fragile" to the lyrical "And You and I" from "Close to the Edge," the songs were sure, powerful and graceful.And then, at the height of its powers, Yes seemed to lose its way. "Tales From Topographic Oceans," a 2-LP issue back in those vinyl days, drove keyboardist Rick Wakeman from the band; he quit after its release, flummoxed by the approach: Four sidelong suites of music, inspired by the Indian shastric scriptures, that just didn't seem to hold together the way the title track for "Close to the Edge" had. "Relayer," the followup from 1974, featured Patrick Moraz filling in for the departed Wakeman, and consisted of a single LP featuring two tracks on side two ("Sound Chaser," "To Be Over") and side one's sidelong "The Gates of Delirium." The album was even more of a mess than "Topographic" was, with Yes descending so far into dissonance on some tracks ("Sound Chaser" especially) that even some of the group's hardcore fans found it difficult to follow.Note: To be fair, I should acknowledge that "Topographic" and "Relayer" have gained some stature over the years. I myself listen to them infrequently, and do enjoy sections of both albums, especially "Topographic's" concluding piece, "Ritual (Nous Sommes Du Soleil)."Yes, itself, seemed to sense this loss of direction; "Relayer" was released in 1974 and it would be three years before "Going For the One" saw daylight in 1977. Part of that time was taken up, of course, by each of the five band members releasing solo albums in 1975.When "Going for the One" did arrive in stores, fans and even critics of Yes were pleased. The album opened with the title track, which packed a lot of gritty rock 'n' roll into just five and a half minutes, thanks in no small measure to Steve Howe's snarling guitars. "Turn of the Century" was a beautiful piece of lyric writing from vocalist Jon Anderson, supported by musical input from Howe and drummer Alan White. Side one concluded with "Parallels," an amazing track by bassist Chris Squire that featured Wakeman's excellent performance on the pipe organ at St. Martins Church in Vevey, Switzerland.None of the three songs on side one exceeded eight minutes in length. Side two began with one that clocked in at just under four, Anderson's beautiful (and radio friendly!) "Wonderous Stories."Yes did revert to the long-song format for the album's final song. But while much of "Relayer" especially seemed like indulgent noodling, "Awaken" clearly was a piece that had been thought out thoroughly by its composers, Anderson and Howe. Its 15:31 running time began with a nimble piano figure from Wakeman, followed by a vocal introduction from Anderson that led into the song's main groove. The interlude featured more of Wakeman's playing on the St. Martins pipe organ, this time showing him in a reflective mood as opposed to his aggressive work on "Parallels."Over the years, "Going For the One" has become one of my "go-to" Yes albums. It's great to put it on and experience, once again, the combination that worked when this band was at its peak: A mix of power, grace and confidence. I highly recommend it.

I saw "Crumb" when it was released several years ago and remember being knocked out at the time, thinking that it was a great, pensive documentary about a truly fascinating subject, "underground" cartoonist R. Crumb, whose disturbing but funny work I'd enjoyed as a young man.A couple of weeks ago, I viewed the film again after a friend asked me to watch it with her (she'd never seen it). After this second viewing, my estimation of the movie has risen: I now believe this to be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.Crumb is a man out of step with modern society, but he's out of step in a way that seems to work for him. His art has always stood out, and frankly, even though I like it, some of his characters border on being repellent. I think one of the great things about him is he can draw something that has you grimacing one moment and laughing your ass off the next.This movie is not without genuine pathos. Crumb's brother Charles is interviewed extensively for the film; he suffered from anxiety and depression, and while some of the things he says here are very funny, he truly was tormented, and committed suicide about a year after filming was complete. The movie is dedicated to him. Robert Crumb's other brother, Maxon, seems more spiritually grounded, but here's a warning: The scenes involving his bed of nails and a yogic purification ritual that involves swallowing a length of thin cloth will be disturbing to some.Robert Crumb's work was a significant element of 1960s and early 1970s counterculture (whatever THAT means now), and he remains a popular and influential artist. Terry Zwigoff, who directed this film, also directed "Ghost World," which is well worth seeing.

I've never seen anything like "The Corndog Man." My fiance turned me onto this film; she has outrageously good but kind of strange taste in movies. I was absolutely FLOORED by this one. It's tremendously funny, for one thing -- the caller who wrecks boat salesman Ace Barker's peace of mind is a grown-up version of, well, any kid who ever picked up a phone out of boredom and started tormenting random or handpicked callers (I confess I did both).But this movie swims in a much deeper sea than mere chuckles and yuks. Ace Barker is a virulent racist (despite his protestations to the contrary) and a truly incorrigible human being who has refused to learn from his considerable mistakes. His inability to acknowledge his awful past is part of his undoing here -- and thus the movie constitutes a true tragedy. For Ace is not a totally reprehensible human being; he's obviously smarter than most of the fools he works with, for example. And he displays a twisted sort of patience, or at least a long-suffering quality. But his tragic downfall is that he cannot own up to his wicked youth.While watching this film, I also experienced a very weird sort of deja vu. Then, suddenly, I realized it: "The Corndog Man" is based in part on a series of infamous and semi-legendary prank calls made in the 1980s to a fellow named Binny Garrick at Al White Motors in Manchester, Tennessee. I never heard these tapes, but a now-deceased friend of mine had connections in the Nashville music business, and he DID hear them -- studio musicians and producers and the like were trading these tapes back in the day, and laughing their heads off at Binny as he spewed profanity at his adversary. And the man messing with him, "Arnie," ACTUALLY WORKED with Binny at Al White Motors! And apparently, THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS!I used to beg my friend to get me copies of those tapes, but he never did, and he's dead now. I've heard there's a guy on the Internet who sells 'em, but I haven't been able to get in touch with him, though I'm still trying. Unlike "The Real Leroy Mercer," a series of howlingly funny prank calls made by the late John Bean, the Binny and Arnie tapes have not been commercially released. Too bad! Anyway, if you're interested in "The Real Leroy Mercer," Amazon sells it, and I heartily recommend it. Just don't mistakenly get any "Roy D. Mercer" discs, which are linked to a stupid and very unfunny DJ who ripped off the original.As for "The Corndog Man," it's a phenomenally good indie film, but it's not for the weak-kneed. Yes, there's humor here, but it's a humor linked to the extreme sadness of the human condition. Watch it if you dare.

Cynics -- and Roger Waters fanatics, if that's not redundant -- didn't have to work hard to find reasons to hate "Pulse" when it was released in 1995. It was a live album recorded during a very lucrative tour following on the heels of a multiplatinum studio album -- exactly what the Floyd had done in 1987 and 1988 with "A Momentary Lapse of Reason," which was followed by the tour-documenting "Delicate Sound of Thunder."But Floyd fans, many of them, were delighted. For one thing, "Pulse" was a better album than "Delicate Sound." For another, it was more honest -- "Delicate Sound actually had included a number of studio-overdub fixes, while "Pulse" had very few."Pulse" also included a live version of "Dark Side of the Moon," and a good one at that -- faithful to the original yet allowing the live band to stretch out a little on songs such as "Money." The version of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" was far superior to the one on "Delicate Sound"; both versions are far shorter than the original but "Delicate had cut the epic song to the bone.The Floyd also had the luxury of cherry-picking the best songs from "The Division Bell" and "A Momentary Lapse of Reason"; the lineup of newer songs included "Learning to Fly," "Keep Talking" and "High Hopes."This version of "Pulse" is the non-blinking one. I had the good fortune to buy one of the early copies with the red, flashing LED light embedded in the spine of the CD box. I've had to replace the batteries several times over the years, but as of this writing in 2012, the light is still doing its thing, blinking away on my CD shelf. What can I say? It kind of ties the room together -- when it's dark. ;)

"On an Island" is the album on which David Gilmour puts the overwhelming, monumental experience that was Pink Floyd behind him. Not that the guitarist/vocalist disavows his former life as a leader of that internationally famous band; instead, Gilmour simply -- and gently -- finds other musical avenues to explore. A song from the Floyd's penultimate studio album was called "On the Turning Away," but that's a title perhaps more apt for this thoughtful, lovely solo album.What must it have been like, to assume the mantle of leadership of Pink Floyd in the mid-1980s when bassist/vocalist/lyricist/conceptualist Roger Waters left the band? Well, Gilmour has hinted in recent years that the pressures were enormous. Nearly all the songwriting duties for 1987's "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" fell to him, drummer Nick Mason having stopped composing and keyboardist Richard Wright having rejoined the band very late in the recording process (Wright had been fired by Waters during the recording of "The Wall" in 1979). Gilmour did hire collaborators for the lyrics and some music, and by the time of "The Division Bell" in 1994, Wright was contributing to the music composition.But many fans knew, back then, that Pink Floyd had become very much David Gilmour's band. He and Waters had worked closely together on many PF projects, most notably "The Wall," even though they didn't always see eye to eye on production values and such. And according to more than one source, including Nicholas Schaffner's "Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey," Columbia Music, PF's American record company at the time, interfered with the recording of "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" when they heard the early mixes, with one exec declaring the music didn't sound "a f***ing thing like Pink Floyd." In addition, the usually slender Gilmour gained considerable weight during this rough time -- a sure sign of stress."Lapse" was followed by a live album, "Delicate Sound of Thunder," which was followed by "The Division Bell," which was followed by a live album and DVD both called "Pulse," and through it all, the reconstituted, Gilmour-led Floyd toured aggressively. It's no wonder it took Gilmour so long to make another solo album!And it has taken me a long, long time to "get" "On An Island." At first, my reaction was it was rather slight. However, over the years the album has grown on me very much, and I now consider it to be Gilmour's most fully realized solo work (his other two albums being "About Face" and "David Gilmour") and also an album that can stand up respectably to Gilmour's contributions to Pink Floyd.My trouble at first was my own -- I was hearing "On An Island" through the massive prism that is Pink Floyd. That image of light being refracted through a prism on "Dark Side of the Moon" had become emblematic of the band's huge stature -- everything they touched, from 1973 on, seemed to burst into the aural equivalent of a rainbow of colors.But the Floyd's sound also grew increasingly "anthemic" from "Dark Side" on: The music, generally, was big and lush and full, and the lyrics ranged from "Dark Side's" commentaries on world-weary life to madness and faded glory on "Wish You Were Here" to scathing Orwellian social commentary on "Animals" and "The Final Cut" to a searing deconstruction of the rock-star lifestyle on "The Wall."Gilmour was wise to turn away from all that and make such a personal album as "On An Island." Some of the highlights:"Castellorization": Sounds somewhat like a Floydian instrumental, but Gilmour's touch on the guitar is a bit gentler than when he was fronting the band."On An Island": The title track does have the breezy feel of life on an island; surrounded by water, what can go wrong? Well, for one thing, the simple passage of time -- it never stands still, and the most beautiful of moments also passes. The singer, though, seems to find acceptance in the very temporal nature of all things."Take a Breath": "Your every breath becomes another world / And the far horizon's living hell." An exploration of living through difficult times."A Pocketful of Stones": I definitely think this is another song about Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett, whom Gilmour replaced early in the band's existence because Barrett had a semi-permanent mental breakdown fueled in part by hallucinogens. Certainly the song is less ambitious than the Floyd's opus about Barrett, the 25-minute "Shine On You Crazy Diamond," from the album "Wish You Were Here." But it's quite moving nonetheless -- the subject of the lyrics, whether it's Barrett or not, displays a somewhat innocent disregard of the "real" world."Where We Started": This full-circle song concludes the album, and simply must be heard to be appreciated. There's a wistful but also satisfied quality to it -- not exactly "feel good," but rather the evocation of the human condition: How to fend off melancholy and enjoy the time one has.Six years it has taken me to be able to write this review. As dedicated Pink Floyd fans know, though, time tends to take on a different scale when you're talking about Pink Floyd -- or David Gilmour -- time. It's been nearly 40 years since I started listening to the Floyd, and that's a long time for any one subject to be such an important part of one's life.I imagine David Gilmour feels somewhat the same way. All that history does wash over and through "On An Island," but the drama of that great sea that was Pink Floyd does not surge and crash here -- think, instead, of tropical breezes and a cool, sweet sea, swimming with memories. This is a fine album, Mr. Gilmour. Bravo.

I remember watching the pilot of "Six Feet Under" way back in June 2001 (God, how long ago that seems) and marveling at how good it was. There were only a couple of things about it that gave me pause -- it wasn't that I didn't LIKE the fake commercials for mortuary products, but I did think they harmed the tone a little bit. And I wasn't sure about the characters; some of them, including younger Fisher brother David, seemed rather selfish and self-absorbed. Overall, though, every element was good -- acting, script, direction, characters.Yet I really don't think I believed at that point that "Six Feet Under" would become one of the best TV shows of all time, or that it would emerge as my personal favorite over all others. That's right -- I believe "Six Feet Under" was THE greatest drama in the history of television. The show "found" itself very, very quickly; after just three or four episodes, I knew it wasn't something I ever wanted to miss. And it just got stronger, season after season, for four years.This set presents all five seasons, and if it doesn't qualify as "keeper" home theater, I don't know what would. Well, the blu-ray version, I guess. Anyone know when we might be getting that?For all my enthusiasm about the show, I can't say I ever "fell in love" with the Fisher family. They were too dysfunctional. Ruth, the mother, could be very uptight. Nate, the older son, came off as one of those folks who project confidence but are tormented inside. David seemed to be playing the role of the dutiful son who stuck with the family funeral business that Nate fled, but as I've observed, he also could be quite selfish -- without even realizing it. And Claire, the daughter ... poor Claire. Confused, angry, experimenting with drugs -- a true teen-aged misfit. (Then again, aren't they all? Isn't "teen-aged misfit" redundant?)But that was the great thing about the series: It presented a family that was real. Their flaws helped define them, just as our own mistakes and missteps and shortcomings help define us as human beings.The characters outside the family circle were just as good. Keith, David's partner, struggling to get David OK with the idea of coming out even though David still felt a need to stay in the closet. Brenda, who begins as nothing more than a fling and ends up in a serious relationship with him. And the ghost or image or ... whatever he is ... of the recently deceased Nathaniel Fisher Sr., the family patriarch who is killed in the pilot when his brand-new hearse is hit by a bus.I could say all kinds of good things about this show, but what its considerable appeal really came down to was the characters. Eleven years after saying goodbye to them, I still miss them. I still think about them; it's as if they are among the people I've lost to death in the last decade or so.Purchase this set and watch this show. I doubt very seriously you'll be disappointed. And when you get to the series finale, savor it -- it's probably the greatest series finale in TV ... oh, you know the rest. But don't skip ahead to it. Watch every single episode that precedes it, in chronological order. That's the only way to get the maximum impact out of this show. Trust me. You'll be glad you did.

Much has been made of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his third novel, "The Shining." In fact, far TOO much has been made of it. True, the book and movie are significantly different, but one wonders what King was expecting. Kubrick was one of the most independent, individualistic of filmmakers; whatever he did, he put his stamp on it. If King thought Kubrick was going to treat "The Shining" any more reverently than any of the director's previous source material, he was sadly mistaken.King's main objection to the film is his belief that Jack Nicholson played Jack Torrance, the lead character in both book and movie, as crazy from the beginning, whereas in the novel, the presumably haunted Overlook Hotel causes Torrance to go gradually insane (in both cases, Jack's alcoholism also seems to be a factor). First of all, King is exaggerating. Yes, the movie does suggest Jack is mentally disturbed before he ever arrives at the Overlook. But the film is yet dynamic concerning this element; whatever is "wrong" with Jack, the Overlook amplifies it drastically. Second, I believe King's opinion was colored by the role Nicholson had played in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," insisting that the audience would identify Jack Torrance with Randall Patrick McMurphy. The truth is, though, that Nicholson made four other films in the five years separating "Shining" and "Cuckoo's Nest."Apparently, this all bothered King so much that he couldn't resist the opportunity to remake "The Shining"; it appeared in 1997 as a three-part TV miniseries based on King's own screenplay. I can describe that effort in one word: Forgettable.And Kubrick's "The Shining" is anything but forgettable. In fact, I think it stands as one of the great horror movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, a very fertile time for the genre.There are images in this film that will haunt me forever. Who can forget Danny, the Torrances' son, riding his Big Wheel down those long, carpeted halls? Or the way the Steadicam followed him? Also memorable: A long, long closeup of nothing more than Nicholson's face, lingering on him as his Jack Torrance begins to come completely unglued. And of course there's the scene in which Jack, trying to get to his wife, Wendy, bashes his way through the bathroom door with an ax. And the two little ghost girls who torment Danny. And the young/old woman in the bathtub. And ...And on and on, really; "The Shining" has so many iconic moments that it's almost inevitable that those who discuss the film will leave out something important. (I've deliberately left out one of the most infamous visuals in the film; feel free to comment on my review if you can fill in the blank.)I think "The Shining" is a great film. Perhaps King is just too close to this particular novel to see it objectively; it is one of his most personal books, given that he struggled with his own substance abuse, as does Jack Torrance. Whether "The Shining" "scares" you or not depends on personal taste; those who love ultraviolent slasher flicks probably aren't going to be impressed. As for me, even though I have viewed the film many times, it always gives me a fright and a thrill.

In 1979, Frank Zappa did something he'd never done in his career, and also something few recording artists EVER had done, at all: He released five albums. It's a feat he would duplicate in 1981 and 1984, but this first time out was very, very impressive, given the consistent high quality of the recordings -- and the fact that two of the releases were double albums, making for SEVEN vinyl discs from FZ that year.He started in January with "Sleep Dirt." Actually, this was one of the albums released without his permission. The whole story involves a twisted tale about his battle with his record company and his desire to release a four-LP set called "L&auml;ther." Most of the material on "Dirt" was supposed to be part of the "L&auml;ther" project, but "Dirt" was a great album in its own right, featuring among other great cuts the instrumental warhorse, "The Ocean Is the Ultimate Solution." Next up, in March, was "Sheik Yerbouti," a two-disc set that managed to offend a lot of people, with songs such as "Jewish Princess" and "Bobby Brown Goes Down." In May, FZ released "Orchestral Favorites," which consisted of five instrumental songs, some of them quite long, especially the 13-minutes-plus "Bogus Pomp."And then, in September and November respectively, came "Joe's Garage Act I" and the double-disc "Joe's Garage Acts II and III" -- altogether, three albums of instrumental and vocal material. "Joe's Garage" was a concept album, but not nearly as exalted or elevated as, say, The Who's "Tommy." Instead, "Joe's Garage" was a raucous, wild set of songs existing as part of a pretty simple plot device: In the future, music itself is outlawed, and the "Central Scrutinizer" watches over all -- enforcing, in fact, laws that haven't even been passed yet! Definitely a figure straight out of George Orwell's "1984."There were the usual, offensive Zappa blasts, such as "Crew Slut" and "Catholic Girls" and "Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?" But with the music itself, Zappa had hit a high point; across these three discs, the listener would hear doo-wop, blues rock, funk, and on and on, as Zappa effortlessly blended musical styles to support his twisted rock opera.FZ also scored one of the greatest songs of his career, the instrumental "Watermelon in Eastern Hay," which listeners over the years -- including Zappa's son, Dweezil -- would declare as the best guitar solo Frank Zappa ever recorded. Certainly, it was emotionally effective, coming near the conclusion of the work, at which point Joe, exhausted from fighting the Scrutinizer and all he represents, imagines one final, impossibly beautiful, incredibly sad, amazingly poignant guitar solo. Even compared with all the great guitar solos he'd recorded previously -- the ones on "Rat Tomago," "The Torture Never Stops" etc. -- "Watermelon in Eastern Hay" was Frank Zappa's masterpiece.Zappa in those days, though, wasn't just committed to making great music and offensive jokes. He was fighting people who would censor music and, he believed, help destroy freedom itself. He had heard about such goings-on in Iran, for example, which, during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, actually outlawed rock music. And by the mid-1980s, he would be fighting would-be censors in his own country, including the Parents' Music Resource Center. Eventually, he would testify before Congress about the perils of censorship."Joe's Garage" stands up today as both a serious protest of such efforts and an outrageous, obnoxious, "in your face" to anyone who would dare try to muzzle people like Frank Zappa. It's also an incredibly listenable album. It didn't hurt that Zappa's collaborators included some of the best musicians in the business at the time, including keyboardists Peter Wolf and Tommy Mars and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta. Go ahead; give it a shot. Just follow the magic footprints. ;)

Way back in the day I was in a record store (remember those?) looking at a copy of Frank Zappa's "Hot Rats." One of he sales clerks saw me and said, very enthusiastically, "You should buy that. The music's fantastic and you don't have to put up with any Zappaloonies." OK, so I had to ask: What's a Zappaloony? The clerk, an avid Zappa fan, explained that he loved Zappa's guitar skills and music composition genius, but wasn't always fond of his lyrics, which he often found silly or trivial or "loony."I bought the album. He was right; it was great. I still listen to "Hot Rats" now and then; it's mostly instrumental, and the one vocal I remember from it, "Willie the Pimp," is pretty straightforward (for Zappa, anyway).But Zappa can be fun when he's indulging in that "loony" side -- and he's really on top of his game on "Sheik Yerbouti." The album is chock-full of fine music but also pointed humor.The opening track, "I Have Been in You," is a send-up of Peter Frampton's "I'm in You," an insipid piece of seduction tripe that had been released recently. Other targets of Zappa's in-your-face humor included the S&M; subculture on "Rubber Shirt" and the title-says-it-all "Jewish Princess," which some found offensive. Clearly, though, his biggest target was the disco craze, which he took apart with "Dancin' Fool."But listeners should be aware that there is some terrific music on this album, too. "Jones Crusher" just rockets out of the speakers, thanks in no small measure to Terry Bozzio's thrashing drums and crazed vocal. The best musical interlude here, though, has to be "Yo Mama." It's a long track with throwaway lyrics (sample: "Maybe you should stay with yo mama / You might start a fire and burn your face") but also a terrific performance by Zappa's band AND, best of all, a monster of a guitar solo from FZ. It doesn't quite rank up there with his solo on "Watermelon in Easter Hay" from "Joe's Garage," but it's close.

OK, folks, the history of this album is so long and strange that I need to make clear what I'm writing here: A chronological account of the album in its several release forms, concluding with a short review/discussion of the 2012 re-release Amazon is selling here. Prospective buyers should pay attention to this to know EXACTLY what they are and are not getting.First of all, just to complicate matters, "Sleep Dirt" wasn't even supposed to be released in its original vinyl incarnation in 1979 -- Warner Bros. records did so without Frank Zappa's permission because of an incredibly complicated dispute regarding how many albums he owed the label at the time. Zappa apparently wanted to release a four-LP set called "L&auml;ther" that would have included most of the material that Warner ended up dribbling out on "Zappa in New York," "Sleep Dirt," "Studio Tan" and "Orchestral Favorites." One more side note and we then move on to the actual versions of "Sleep Dirt": A version of "L&auml;ther" finally did come out after Zappa's death.The versions of "Sleep Dirt":1. Vinyl version, Warner Bros., 1979: The original was released without credits because Zappa had given his record company only the songs themselves -- no information on personnel, for example. However, fans who knew Zappa's work well could certainly hear stalwart contributors such as bassist Patrick O'Hearn on some tracks as well as drummer Terry Bozzio and percussionist Ruth Underwood. There were four songs on side one: "Filthy Habits," "Flambay," "Spider of Destiny" and "Regyptian Strut." Side two consisted of "Time Is Money," "Sleep Dirt" and "The Ocean Is The Ultimate Solution." Except for the side break, each song segued into the next without a break.2. First CD version, Rykodisc, 1991: The song lineup was the same except that there was, obviously, no side break necessary. However, Zappa had Chad Wackerman replace the drum parts on "Flambay" and "Spider of Destiny" and, on some versions of the disc, "Regyptian Strut," although NOT on "Time Is Money" despite the declaration of the liner notes to that effect. But the biggest change, and the one that seemed to upset fans the most, was the addition of Thana Harris' vocals on "Flambay," "Spider of Destiny" and "Time Is Money." Zappa said at the time that those songs were always intended to be sung, having been written for a musical that was to be called "Hunchentoot." Well, OK. But it wasn't just that the songs had vocals now; they had Harris' HUGE, over the top vocals, and the contrast to someone who'd grown up with the album could, indeed, be quite jarring. But it should be pointed out that Zappa did approve this mix.3. Current (2012) Universal Music CD version: This restores the original vinyl mix, and does so with clarity and precision. Of course, it's a little glassier than the original vinyl, but that's probably unavoidable, and it's "hotter" than the original LP. For most listeners, this probably now constitutes the definitive form of the album, although I probably always will prefer the vinyl version.Unfortunately, I let my vinyl copy slip away years ago and now have been forced to reacquire one at a price that irks me greatly. But this is an outstanding Zappa album, despite its convoluted history, and if my having all three versions constitutes excess, then I'll just have to be excessive. ;)One last comment: It's interesting that an artist's viewpoint on his or her work isn't always shared by fans, isn't it?

Not until after I saw this film did I find out it was made for half a million dollars. I was shocked by that -- it looks to have cost ten times that much. The filmmakers squeezed enormous value out of every penny spent; the special effects are outrageously good, the cinematography quite sophisticated given the budget, the acting incredible.But without a great story, all that amounts to nothing, and "Monsters" is a great story of two people caught up in a frightening situation who find out what it means, ironically, to be human.Please don't listen to the naysayers regarding this film; they're simply missing the point. This wasn't meant to be just a horror movie. It's a very, very shrewd commentary, in fact, on bigotry, misunderstanding, and in fact on current social views in the U.S. and beyond on subjects such as immigration policy.The movie was put together based more on an outline than a script, with the two lead actors (who were engaged at the time and now married) providing a lot of ad-libbing. Sometimes that approach can be a disaster, but it really works here.I strongly disagree with accusations that these characters were not well-developed. That's nonsense. Yes, there's some mystery here, but that's part of the point.And finally, the monsters: I ... LOVED them! They manage to be wonderfully retro and really cool looking at the same time. And there's certainly a nod to H.P. Lovecraft's "Cthulhu," visually speaking -- but that imagery is put to use that is emotionally complex and, in the end, very satisfying.Incredible movie, one of the best I've seen in the last couple of years.

Note: I am reviewing the 3-disc version, which includes the 5.1 mix by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson.Wilson is a busy man these days. In addition to his working with his own band Porcupine Tree, since 2009 he has devoted a great deal of his time to remixing the King Crimson catalog in new, double-disc versions that include 5.1 mixes in the supposedly dead DVD-Audio format.The results have been, for this listener, amazing. I own every Crimson studio album, but I have bought every updated release. Wilson, working with Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp, has created not one but SEVERAL masterpieces so far, with "In the Court of the Crimson King" deserving special mention for the way Wilson reconfigured the sounds for 5.1 without destroying the uncanny ambiance that marked the band's debut.So it came as something of a surprise to me that I have to deduct a star for Wilson's update of "Emerson, Lake & Palmer," the group's first album, from 1970. And I feel bad for doing so, because I honestly don't know what the man should have done given the situation he was facing with this one.The problem: Wilson could not locate the multi-track masters for two of the three sections of "The Three Fates", nor the entirety of "Tank," which in my mind are two crucial pieces of this album. The first shows off Emerson's keyboard skills in three specific settings -- organ, piano solo, piano trio. The second, "Tank," was an Emerson/Palmer composition featuring a build-up-to-blistering drum performance by Palmer.Faced with something like this, there are three options: 1. Abandon the project, which some think Wilson probably should have done. 2. Use the available stereo versions of the missing sections and drop them into the 5.1 mix -- not at all ideal, but you preserve the track listing and running order of the original album. 3. Do what Wilson did: Substitute other material for which the multi-track tapes were available.So on this three-disc set, we do get one CD of the original stereo album, remastered, and a CD of "The Alternate ELP" that's pretty much duplicated on the DVD Audio disc. Wilson found a version of "Promenade," later to be incorporated into ELP's "Pictures at an Exhibition," and a band jam called "Rave Up" to fill out the missing sections.I know there have been howls of protest over this from other reviewers here. But I think they're being somewhat too harsh. After all, the original album is all here, albeit in a two-channel mix. And we're probably getting the best 5.1 mix we can, unless or until those missing masters ever turn up -- and I doubt they ever will.If you're a purist about this album, maybe this version isn't for you -- although I have to warn you that in missing "Raveup," you're missing a pretty fine piece of music in its own right.Frankly, despite the technical problems, I don't see how Wilson and original ELP producer, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, could have made the decision to SCRAP the band's DEBUT ALBUM from the 5.1 remix program, which is supposed to continue. I'd also point out this isn't the only imperfect 5.1 mix out there; far from it. Many 5.1 releases go back to classic rock albums, and keep in mind the age of the original tapes of those by now! Forty-plus to nearly fifty years. Such tapes have to be baked in special ovens before they can even take a chance at accessing them safely. And of course the worst possibility of all: Not being able to find all the source material. Bob Clearmountain and Rhett Davies remixed Roxy Music's "Avalon" for 5.1 SACD, and it's an amazing result -- just look at the price third-party sellers are getting for it now, which Amazon will delete if I quote it here, but take a gander. Anyway, one track was missing from that, the instrumental "India." Their regular elegant solution was to slowly pan the whole thing right around the room in 5.1, and it sounds wonderful.Final thoughts on the music itself: "Emerson, Lake & Palmer" was released 43 years ago, but it doesn't sound as dated to me as some records from 1970. For one thing, the band was aggressive and accomplished even at this early stage; all three members play beautifully. And the songs were varied, from the very hard energy of "Knife-Edge" and "The Barbarian" to the softer feel of Lake's "Lucky Man" and the sprawling ballad "Take a Pebble." ELP served as whipping post for a lot of rock critics at the time who found them impossibly pretentious, but when you listen back to them now, they just sound like a pretty tight, pretty amazing rock band most of the time, with the jazz and classical flourishes they loved tucked in nicely here and there. This would change over time as Emerson especially led the band on an orchestral obsession that culminated with "Works, Vol. 1" But that's a different album (can't wait to see what Steven Wilson does with that one). "Brain Salad Surgery" is widely considered ELP's signature work, but this debut was an incredibly strong beginning. If you remember it fondly, hear it again. If you're not familiar, by all means, seek it out and experience it, whether in standard stereo or this sprawling version. The bottom line is that there is good, fiery music here.

People are always asking me what my favorite books are -- top five or top ten. My problem is that list changes as I read new ones and re-read old favorites. But ever since its publication, John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany" has been on my short list. This is, quite simply, one of the five best books I've ever read. I also believe it to be Irving's best work, and that's saying something, because "Garp" and "Cider-House Rules," especially, are great novels.Irving's story of a boy, Owen Meany, who believes he is God's instrument, is spiritual without being preachy, philosophical without being pretentious, heartbreaking yet not without hope. It's one of those fine, fine books that tells a terrific story even as it raises important questions about human existence, human purpose.Final observation: I like books that balance intellectual content with emotional impact. You won't find a better example of that than "A Prayer for Owen Meany." In my case, it literally changed my life -- much of my spiritual angst was relieved after reading this. I now live much easier with the certainty that uncertainty in our lives is a factor. I entrust the rest to God. Things are as they are -- and I am part of them.

I must have read "The Complete Adventures of the Borrowers" about a dozen times after receiving a copy as a child in the 1960s. Of course, at that time, "The Borrowers Avenged" had not been published yet, but I thoroughly enjoyed the four installments that preceded it, and which were called, at that time, "Complete."My enjoyment of the series seemed a bit odd even to me -- an American boy reading a decidedly English series of novels featuring, as their protagonist, a teen-aged girl. But Arrietty was a vivid, delightful, tomboyish character -- perhaps I even had a bit of a juvenile crush on her. :)One of the great things about the sequels was that author Mary Norton seemed willing to devote as much energy to them as she had to the first book. In "Afield," "Afloat" and "Aloft," she conjured up stories that were rather quietly written but exciting nonetheless. I could not resist seeing where she took these little people next -- into an old, abandoned boot, afloat on a stream in a tea kettle, and into the air in a balloon.If Mary Norton had not returned to this subject in 1982, when she published "The Borrowers Avenged," I'd be giving this set five stars instead of four. Unfortunately, the fifth book simply is not as good as its predecessors. It's a much longer book, for one thing, but instead of being richer, the story drags. On the plus side, I did enjoy the new character, Peagreen -- Peagreen Overmantel, to be exact, but he's not quite the stuck-up fop that Homily, Arrietty's mother, had led her to expect.These are terrific books to share with children of a certain age -- older than five or six, generally, and younger than teen. The books have a classic, timeless appeal, written by a woman possessed of a true storyteller's heart. Finally, they evoke an England that has faded away: That transitional time from the late Victorian to early Edwardian era, when pastoral lifestyle and traditional values began to give way to electric light, the telephone and other modern "conveniences." It's easy to imagine that borrowers could have existed, even thrived, in that now-gone gaslit world.

To be direct and concise about it: "A Wrinkle in Time" is one of the greatest titles in all of 20th-century juvenile literature.To be a little more verbose about it:One of the fine things about this novel is its characterization. Charles Wallace, Meg and Calvin, the three main characters, are richly drawn -- I first read the book when I was 10 or so, and these kids could have been my real-life friends; they were that real to me.The plot: It features both science-fiction and fantasy trappings. Basically, Charles Wallace and Meg's father, a scientist, has gone missing. Turns out he and his colleagues were fooling around with a technique that involves folding space somehow. It isn't spelled out, explicitly, exactly how they were doing this, but that doesn't matter -- the point is that the kids' father is nowhere to be found, and in the town where the family lives, ugly rumors are going around, including one that has the dad leaving the children's beautiful mother for another woman.The setting: I don't want to say too much about it for fear of spoiling the story, but I'll just write that the planet to which we travel as readers is dark, menacing, even a bit frightening for younger readers. It's also incredibly detailed and well-imagined.I am in my 50s now, but I STILL think about this book and re-read it from time to time. It's an absolute classic.

I never really have understood why this album was released. I used to have it on vinyl; God knows where it is now. Anyway, I know it has the re-recorded version of "Money," and the single version of "Another Brick..." and a cool cover, but for the life of me I can't figure out why I should care. The truth is there's very little here to get all worked up about, even if you're a Floyd fanatic.

I have to begin by stating that in this review I am simply not going to consider the work of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young -- for the simple reason that, when Neil Young joins the CSN mix and it becomes CSNY, you're really talking about a completely different band. The whole vibe changes (the band agrees on this, by the way). So: No effort here to compare this album with, say, CSNY's "Deja Vu." IMHO, that would just be apples and oranges.OK: With that understood, I will go ahead and say that "CSN" is the greatest album of Crosby, Stills & Nash's career. Better than their debut? Yes, more mature in the songwriting and the performances. Better than the big-selling "Daylight Again"? Yes, even with hits on that album such as "Southern Cross," it was dicey, partly because of David Crosby's limited involvement, although "Delta" is a tremendous song. Better than "Allies," "Live it Up" and "After the Storm." OK, now there's just no comparison at all."CSN" arrived in June 1977, just a few days before summer's official start that year, and the album sounded like summer itself. The metaphor works perfectly, because the band's debut album -- the eponymous "Crosby, Stills and Nash" from 1969 -- definitely had been the group's springtime. "Guinnevere," "Wooden Ships," "Helplessly Hoping": the songs from that first record were the songs of young men -- young men in love, young men passionate about the revolution-tinged politics of the times, young men learning who they were and would be."CSN," while still driven largely by acoustic guitars and swee harmonies, was sultrier, grittier. These fellows were nearly a decade older in 1977, and had seen some hard times, including an abortive attempt to put CSNY back together in 1974 and personal problems including alcoholism and drug abuse. The seasoning may have been tough on their personal lives but it was, at that time, not bad for their music."Shadow Captain" opened "CSN" to great effect. With words by Crosby and music by session keyboardist Craig Doerge, this was a song for the ages. "Shadow captain" Crosby and his partners sang, "of a charcoal ship / trying to give the light the slip," gliding the pitch up on that last word till it stood the hairs up on the back of your neck.Crosby contributed another song to that first side of what was then, of course, a vinyl record: "Anything At All," a slow-paced, self-deprecating piece in which Crosby literally laughed off, at one moment, the idea that he could be anyone's guru.Stephen Stills' songs for side one were both thrilling: "See the Changes" chronicled the process of aging into one's thirties and realizing one's limitations. "Fair Game" was darker, dealing with sexual gamesmanship in which "an ugly duckling" woman grows up and strikes back.The Graham Nash tunes for side one: Nash had written the weakest songs for the band's debut ("Pre-Road Downs" among them); here, he offers some of the strongest. "Carried Away" was uncharacteristically melancholy; in the song, the male persona is entranced with a woman he knows he cannot keep. And "Cathedral" was absolutely magnficent, reputedly based on Nash's having wandered into Winchester Cathedral blasted on acid. Not surprisingly, the narrator does not find peace there.Nash also acquitted himself well on side two, offering the decidedly downbeat "Cold Rain" and the breezier "Just a Song Before I Go," a lovely love song that charted as a single. Stills, almost always the trio's most prolific songwriter, contributed three songs, all top-notch and all hard-nosed and devastatingly honest: "Dark Star," "Run From Tears" and "I Give You Give Blind."Crosby offered just one song for side two, but it was a glorious keeper: "In My Dreams," a swirling, surrealistic song wrapped up beautifully in fairly sparse instrumentation -- just the acoustic guitars of Crosby and Stills along with a minimal drum part from Russ Kunkel and some haunting vibraphone touches from Joe Vitale. What a stunner. CSN has performed this tune onstage at times over the years, despite its tricky timing. At one such occasion in the 1990s in Kansas City's Starlight Theatre, they played the absolute daylights out of it just as dusk fell over the outdoor venue. Crosby, obviously delighted, said, "When that one goes well, you know it's going to be a good night."The singer/songwriter wave of the 1970s was like many other developments in pop music, from punk to disco to grunge and so on: That is, the quality of the work varied widely. Perhaps that is true in all times. But when the singer/songwriters were at the top of the game, they were able to get music onto tape that would outlast their time. Some of the watershed albums of that movement/era would be Jackson Browne's "The Pretender," Warren Zevon's "Excitable Boy," Joni Mitchell's "Don Juan's Reckless Daughter," and Bruce Cockburn's vastly underrated "Humans" -- and, oh yeah, a little thing by another Canadian rocker, Neil Young, an album called "Harvest."And yes, "CSN," which, in the end, lived up to its title. That is, it was the album that represented the purest, most concentrated, most focused version ever of this band -- the true fusion of these three personalities into one creative entity. Don't overlook this excellent album.

I find it ironic and perversely satisfying that "Prometheus" is getting such mixed reviews. Why? Because it only reinforces my opinion that this is some kind of great movie, to paraphrase an old friend. And furthermore, because this is EXACTLY what happens to director Ridley Scott when he makes science fiction films. Look back at some of the contemporaneous reviews of 1979's "Alien" and 1982's "Blade Runner." When you do, you'll find a lot of vitriol being directed at Scott by film critics.One tired gripe, which is resurfacing with "Prometheus," is that Scott puts the visuals ahead of the story. I think that is baloney. Yes, the visuals in "Prometheus" are astonishing, but science fiction MUST look good; it must astound us and fill us with wonder. Besides, the story here does have depth -- it's just that Scott, as always, is asking you, the viewer, to do some of the work. This is in the grand tradition of another filmmaker, by the way -- Stanley Kubrick, who directed "2001: A Space Odyssey." And Scott has said in recent interviews that "2001" influenced "Prometheus."I am not ready to say that "Prometheus" is in the same league as "2001," which stands as one of the greatest movies of all time, science fiction or otherwise. But it shares some of the themes of "2001," including the idea that some sort of alien presence manipulated things here on Earth so that humans would evolve into the dominant species. Also, "Prometheus" refuses to answer all the questions it poses, just as "2001" did. To me, that's the sign of great storytelling, whether the medium be film, novel or stage play.I think "Prometheus" will -- as "Alien" and "Blade Runner" did -- acquire more stature over time. Meanwhile, naysayers might want to note that as of December 8, 2012, the film has made more than $400 million worldwide, meaning it has recouped its cost, and then some. Clearly, the film is reaching a receptive audience.In addition to its other strengths, the theatrical version of the film deployed some of the best and most subtle 3D visuals to date. I am happy to report that the Blu-ray 3D version looks every bit as good on my TV, despite the much smaller picture. The 4-disc edition (3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray special features, DVD/Digital Copy) contains seven hours of bonus materials.I agree that "Prometheus" is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the picture clearly was written with a sequel in mind -- the ending practically screams the word "sequel," to be honest. Back in the day, though -- I'm talking more than half a century ago -- one could go to the theater and see science fiction and other genre pieces presented in serial form.Despite its flaws, "Prometheus" is a winner. Why? Because, in the end, it is greater than the sum of its parts. The holes in the story, the mediocre acting by some of the minor cast members, the occasional bit of silliness -- all of that can be forgiven, for this is a film that asks huge questions about who we are, how we began, and what we might become as a species. "Prometheus," like its namesake, is overly ambitious, but I'd rather have that, any day of the week, in my movies, music and literature. Far better to aspire and fall slightly short than not to care at all.

"Heroes" is David Bowie's best album, hands down. This is a brilliant record from start to finish. It's the middle installment of what has become known as the "Berlin Trilogy," three albums Bowie made while living in that city; the albums are "Low," "Heroes" and "Lodger."In my opinion, Bowie achieved the perfect balance on this record between conventional pop/rock structure and more of an "art rock" aesthetic. "Low," on the other hand, veered somewhat too much toward the arty, while "Lodger" definitely stepped more toward the pop side.Side One of "Heroes" (sorry, I was brought up in the vinyl era) is superb, and more pop/rock than Side Two. That's not to say it isn't interesting and innovative. "Beauty and the Beast," "Joe the Lion," "Heroes" and "Blackout" are all just KILLER rock songs, and the fourth song, "Sons of the Silent Age," is gentler but just as stunning, putting Bowie's impressive vocal range to excellent use.These songs' instrumentation consists of the usual rock stuff -- guitars, bass, keyboards, drums. But when Robert Fripp is your lead guitarist ... well, you're just not going to sound "normal" with the King Crimson founder playing on your stuff. Fripp is especially brilliant on the title track; "Heroes" just soars and screams, and the mood -- of some kind of ecstatic triumph merging with something sadder, darker -- is just insanely addictive. I have, at times, played this song half a dozen times in a row.Side Two is a completely different animal, all art-rock edges and strange, otherworldly corners. There's a definite Eastern influence that does not overwhelm the music. "V-2 Schneider" is the most driving song here, and it's followed by three pieces of music that can only be described as aural meditations -- "Sense of Doubt," "Moss Garden" and "Neukoln." Each piece flows into the next. "Sense of Doubt," despite being quiet, does sound rather menacing, while "Moss Garden" is much more reflective; by the time "Neukoln" begins, we've moved out of rock 'n' roll completely, and into a realm of music that becomes, ultimately, undefinable.Bowie ends the side and the album with the strangely satisfying "The Secret Life of Arabia." It's more concrete than the pieces that have preceded it, but every bit as moving and mysterious.I absolutely love this album. I don't ever get tired of it, not even after having listened to it for a quarter century. This is amazing music; don't miss it.

It's hard to believe now, given the airplay they received and the records they sold, but Pink Floyd's truly "classic" period lasted a very short time -- just the seven short years encompassing 1973 through 1979.Before 1973, they had been struggling to redefine themselves in the wake of the drug-fueled mental meltdown of their first singer/guitarist, Syd Barrett. Barrett had written almost all the material on PF's first album, 1967's "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn." Without him, the Floyd seemed pretty lost, even with the addition of guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, who was (arguably) Barrett's equal as a singer and certainly his superior as a guitar player.From Barrett's departure until 1973, Pink Floyd slogged through some very mediocre albums ("More," "Atom Heart Mother"), approached coherence on "Ummagumma," and produced two fine records indeed, 1971's "Meddle" and 1972's "Obscured by Clouds."With "Dark Side of the Moon," though, the Floyd was reborn. Bassist Roger Waters took over all the lyric writing, while Gilmour, keyboardist Rick Wright and drummer Nick Mason continued to contribute to composing the music. The combination of Waters' penetrating lyrics and the band's tuneful songs was a sure winner.And so PF's classic period began. It continued in 1975 with "Wish You Were Here" and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with "Animals" in 1977.I remember exactly where I was in 1979 when I first heard "The Wall" in its entirety. I had bought the album Friday, Nov. 30, the day it came out, and brought it to my cousins' house. Several of us played pool while my younger cousin sat on an ottoman, reading the lyric sheets to himself and making occasional comments such as, "You're gonna love this next line."And we did love it -- from that first listen, we all knew the Floyd had produced another classic. And it was a classic despite being radically different from its recent predecessors. Both "Animals" and "Wish You Were Here" had featured some very long songs. "The Wall" went the other way, with lots of short, to-the-point pieces. There were no epics, such as the 17-minute "Dogs" from "Animals."Over the years, though, "The Wall" hasn't worn quite as well as it should have. To be honest, there were some songs on it that seemed kind of throwaway -- "Vera," "Waiting for the Worms," to name two. And Waters had taken over most of the lead vocals, despite having developed a delivery that was becoming ever more strident, brittle and histrionic.Fortunately, the great songs far outweighed the bad. "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2," "Mother," "Young Lust, "Hey You," "Nobody Home" and especially "Comfortably Numb" were all stupendous.Too bad tensions were tearing the band apart. Before the album was mixed and released, Waters demanded Wright be fired. He was, but the remaining trio of Gilmour, Mason and Waters would make just one album together, 1983's "The Final Cut," and many listeners felt it was more like a Roger Waters solo album than a PF album. Waters then quit, and Mason and Gilmour asked Wright to return for the last two Floyd studio albums, "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" and "The Division Bell."Parts of "Final Cut" and "Lapse" were downright cringe-worthy. "Division Bell," the band's very last studio record, was much better, giving the band a fitting farewell.But it's "The Wall" that stands as the last truly great Pink Floyd album. If you've heard it, you know what I mean; if not, don't hesitate to give it a try.

King Crimson's deluxe, multidisc "In the Court of the Crimson King" and 5.1 surround is the perfect match. Because of the way the album was recorded -- very open sonic spaces to begin with, plus a rather stately tempo throughout -- it invites sitting in the midst of one's speaker array on a rainy day, simply absorbing..The title track benefits most from the remix, with some excellent decisions having been made regarding the false ending. I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling.Other elements of this big package: Declicked original album mix, alternate takes; the usual stuff, really. But King Crimson never would record another album quite like this -- for the most part, ITCOTKC is airy, atmospheric, pensive. Yes, elements of future KC albums would sound like this, but they dominate here.As recording of this album was concluded and a brief tour undertaken, Crimson would suffer the first of many crushing breakup/personnel changes, but somehow would carry on. Hear this for a sonic snapshot of what they were near their very beginning.

This is one of the greatest albums of Brian Eno's career. And I say that as a fan who's mostly interested in Eno's instrumental music, not his vocal records.Not that there's anything wrong with the latter. Eno has a great voice, in my opinion -- not typical of pop music, to be sure, which always seems to value brassy tenors over baritones. It's just that his instrumental work has been so unusual, influential and arresting."Before and After Science" is, above all else, a GREAT rock record. Side one (showing my age; oops) just burbles with energy, from the angular "No One Receiving" to the rather manic "King's Lead Hat" (an anagram, for those who haven't read up on it yet, for Talking Heads, with whom Eno has worked extensively). There's even an instrumental in the mix, the pensive, beautiful "Energy Fools the Magician."Side two, though, is the classic side here -- one of the greatest album sides in popular music history. "Here He Comes" is absolutely gorgeous; it really is ear candy with intelligence. "Julie With ..." is a much slower-tempo, thoughtful song that drifts through your listening room like smoke. Eno composed "By This River" with members of Cluster, and the song has a melancholy, kind of otherworldly feel to it. "Through Hollow Lands" is another ghostly instrumental, this one dedicated to Harold Budd, with whom Eno recorded "The Plateaux of Mirror" and "The Pearl" (both highly recommended). Finally, the album closes with "Spider and I," a very haunting vocal piece with a distinct meldoy; I can hear it playing in my head as I write this, and I haven't listened to it for some time."Before and After Science" is one of my two favorite Eno vocal records, the other being "Another Day on Earth." It's a must for every Eno fan, and indeed can be considered essential listening for anyone who values British rock from the 1970s.

Much of this brilliant album is about the expression of dynamics -- that force in music that permits change, breath, variation. On this record, King Crimson may have taken that value to extremes, to the point that it irritated a lot of listeners. On "Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One," for example, the differences between the softest and loudest passages were such that, if you turned up the original vinyl loudly enough to hear the soft stuff, you were blasted out of your chair when the band turned up the volume.But that was part of the point here -- to make music that shattered the ideas of what "rock" should be, whether those preconceptions came from the record company, the audience or even certain musicians themselves.Overall, this is a very demanding listen, as Crimso albums tend to be. Together, the two parts of "Larks' Tongues ... " constitute 20 minutes of shifting, elusive, loudest-then-softest, time-changing, instrumental music, and they open and close the album. In between: Three vocal pieces, but of the three, only "Book of Saturday" is concise, at just under three minutes; the other two -- "Exiles and "Easy Money" -- provide John Wetton a chance to sing as well as play bass, yet, at more than seven minutes each, there's plenty of room for the band to stretch out.Then there's "The Talking Drum," a nearly eight-minute instrumental that comes just scurrying out of the speakers. Driven at a fast clip by Wetton's bass along with Bill Buford's drums and Jamie Muir's percussion, the song also provides space for violinist David Cross and guitarist Robert Fripp to shine -- or in this case, to screech in a way I used to find annoying but have grown to love!I don't go to this album as often as I'd like; I find it DEMANDS my attention in a way that does not permit it to be used as mere background music. But along with Crimson's debut, plus "Starless and Bible Black," "Red," "Discipline" and "Thrak," it forms one of the great little corners of my entire musical collection. I simply can't imagine not owning this.

I was about 19 when this album first came out, and to be honest, I didn't know what to think of it. It certainly was INTERESTING to me. It was also angular, frequently discordant, mordantly aggressive, and thoroughly intellectual and intimidating.Having had three decades to listen to it now, I can honestly say I love revisiting this album. "Exposure" is one of Fripp's stronger records, and this is a man who has released some very good albums over the years, both on his own ("At the End of Time") and with King Crimson ("Starless and Bible Black," "Thrak" etc.).Special favorites here: The menacing rumble of "Chicago" and the starkly beautiful "North Star."I personally could have done without the voice-overs from John G. Bennett, a G.I. Gurdjieff adherent for whom Fripp apparently had a special fondness. Then again, these occasional, spliced-in declarations, such as, "it is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering," did, I suppose, add something to the album's eerie appeal.Fripp is one of the most distinctive guitarists of the last half-decade, and he plays very well here. You know, the instant you hear his first note, who he is and what he's about. I absolutely love the tones he can get out of the instrument.Recommended, for those willing to take a little risk.

I bought this album when it was first released way back in 1978. I was 17, almost 18, at the time, and purchased the record mainly because of a review I read in "Rolling Stone" magazine.I took it home and instantly put it on my turntable. What I heard was like ... NOTHING else I'd ever heard in my life: Quiet, pensive loops of musical phrases, played mostly on keyboards. The very air of my room seemed to change; it became more open, more spacious but at the same time more intimate. If you're an Eno fan, you know exactly what I mean. If you're not, it may be high time you found out.Eno wanted, at the time, to make music that could be paid attention to or that could fade into the background of whatever it was you were doing in your life as you listened to it. I found that idea very refreshing. We ALL use music sometimes as sonic wallpaper, and here, finally, was an artist not only willing to admit that fact but proud of embracing it!The instrumentation is sparse: Electric piano, acoustic piano and synthesizer, except for two tracks on which a trio of female singers provide vocals. The "arrangements" of the four pieces, if "arrangements" they can be called, are simple, repetitive and hypnotic.And, most important, despite the apparent simplicity, there is something very, very moving about the whole thing. Eno may have succeeded in making "ambient" music, but that doesn't mean it wasn't memorable.I have been listening to this album for 34 years and still have not "gotten" all of it. That's the mark of great music -- when it can be returned to, over and over again, and when it gives you something slightly different every time you encounter it.

This is by far the oddest entry in Brian Eno's series of four albums with "Ambient" in their title. For one thing, it's credited to Laraaji, not Laraaji and Eno. For another, the sound isn't dominated by keyboards and synths but rather by Laraaji's dulcimer (on the three "The Dance" tracks) and zither backed by dulcimer (on the two "Meditation" pieces.Eno's role here is one of producer and supplier of various "treatments" to alter the sounds Laraaji is making; those treatments include delay and phasing. Thus, it's understandable that Eno did not take more credit, as he doesn't really "play" on this album. By contrast, he plays synthesizer and a few other instruments on "The Plateaux of Mirror," the second in the "Ambient" series, while his partner on that record, Harold Budd, plays piano and electric piano.I think "Day of Radiance" is a bit harder to listen to than the other three "Ambient" series records. Then again, listening to ANY of the four albums with one's full attention isn't really the idea -- Eno himself stated that these ambient albums should be as ignorable as they are listenable. I always find, listening to any of them, that a phrase or particular sound will grab my attention, then I will be focusing on my writing or whatever it is I'm doing at the time, then another sound will pull me back in again, and so on. My attention sharpens, dissolves, re-focuses ... and so on. Which was exactly Eno's intent.This is beautiful, strange, haunting music. If at times it ends up being nothing more than sonic wallpaper, well, again, that was the artist's and the producer's intent.

"On Land" is the most shadowy and most threatening of the four Eno (or three Eno and one Eno-produced) albums labeled "Ambient." The first album, "Music for Airports," had featured acoustic piano, electric piano, synthesizer and voice. The second, "The Plateaux of Mirror," was dominated by the piano of Eno's partner for that project, Harold Budd, with some ghostly synth touches and "treatments" by Eno. The third, "Day of Radiance," was credited to zither and dulcimer player Laraaji, with Eno again "treating" the sounds by altering them sonically. "On Land" did feature synthesizers, but also the sounds of birds, amphibians, and even rocks and sticks that Eno decided to use as instruments.The result is a much darker work, yet one that retains the sense of exacting quietude that had marked the first three albums. In general, all four albums always have sounded best to me when played after nightfall, but this is especially true of "On Land" -- it's just one of those records that begs to be listened to when you have insomnia and everyone else is abed.Seriously, this record has gotten me through a lot of dark nights and not a few dark nights of the soul. Listening to it, I have always felt, at once, challenged, somewhat disquieted, and strangely comforted. I suspect my experiencing those conflicting feelings is exactly the kind of effect Eno intended the album to have -- and also that my reactions to it are no more valid than someone else who might have a completely different response.This is a brilliant collection of music, highly recommended to anyone with an open mind and open ears.

I hesitated before buying this DVD -- I'm a guitarist, not a drummer. Furthermore, the times I've been forced to fake my way through a bass or keyboard part, I've been able to do it. But I've NEVER been able to deal with percussion, not even a drum kit -- my brother, who IS a drummer, finally just hung his head and declared me unteachable. Apparently, I just do not have the (natural?) physical coordination that allows a human being to play a 4/4 part with the hands and a 5/8 with the feet. Or something like that.HOWEVER ... I am SO GLAD I finally broke down and bought this. It's an amazing disc, featuring some great parts. Here are the most significant:1. Roundtable discussion featuring ex-Zappa percussionist Ruth Underwood along with ex-FX drummers Ralph Humphrey, Chester Thompson, Chad Wackerman and Terry Bozzio. Warning: It may sometimes get a bit heavy-going for non-percussionists. Bozzio also serves as moderator, but I wish he'd been more aggressive about turning the conversation when and where he wanted it to go. Instead, he's more of a &#34;see what happens&#34; kind of guy. It works when everyone is feeling relaxed, but the minute there's any tension in the room, you can feel the unease, and the need to redirect the discussion goes unmet. Also, Chad Wackerman is such a quiet guy that he often has to be drawn out. Still, how much can you complain about this?2. An actual drumming demonstration featuring everyone but Underwood. OK, I may not be a drummer, but even I'm not too stupid to realize this is fantastic. As with the verbal conversation, Bozzio seems to be the driving force here; the difference is he knows when to assert himself and when to draw back and let someone else take the spotlight. Since I'm not a percussionist, I'm sure there are loads of things I missed, but I did notice the following: Humphrey plays using &#34;traditional grip,&#34; which shouldn't be surprising since he and Chester Thompson are the most jazz-oriented of the drummers here, and that grip is most associated with snare drummers who played in marching bands and, later, jazz. Wackerman uses matched grip, but his hands are much &#34;looser&#34; than Thompson's, who actually seems to tighten up on the sticks when he's playing something complex. Finally, there's Bozzio, who also uses matched grip -- but his kit is so freakin' huge, how you gonna tell unless you're sitting backstage somewhere?3. Finally, Bozzio's kit: It has gotten so large that it's just about impossible to describe. To find out more, just Google &#34;Terry Bozzio's drum kit&#34; and look at the results for &#34;images&#34; and &#34;youTube.&#34; I'll just say that I don't think ANYONE &#34;needs&#34; such a kit to play, but ... then again! ... I'm a guitarist. So when I say, &#34;Yeah, I'm gonna need a second amp for that and you drummers roll your eyes, just remember: I may not understand everything you're doing back there, but I'm watching you! :)

Despite my admiration for the director, I had never seen this particular film. I was mesmerized. Yes, it's highly stylized, but never melodramatic. The imagery is beautiful, the story heartbreaking. It's an incredible film, though, because it depends on great storytelling -- and a great situation, the love triangle, which is one of the oldest in the human condition. But it seems fresh here. Highly recommended.

Even among fans of the late director Stanley Kubrick, "Barry Lyndon" can be a divisive subject, with some advocating for the brilliance of the film and others insisting it's the most boring thing Kubrick ever made. Check out this excerpt from an Amazon reviewer who gave it one star: " ... 'Gone With the Wind' without any of the interesting bits. A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and film snobs."Well put, even if he didn't like the film and even though I disagree. Since I'm not a cinematographer, I guess that must mean I'm a film snob. And a really SNOBBY snob, at that, for I absolutely ADORE this movie.I will, admit, though, that it took a long time to grow on me. The darned thing IS awfully long, about three hours. And Kubrick's pacing, never all that quick (especially by modern standards) is just about glacial here. But this film is not an action flick; it's a study of character and mannerisms and class warfare. In the film, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), hardly an aristocrat, finds himself by virtue of fate cast into their company. He then embarks on a quest for power and riches, but finds it challenging, to say the least, to fit into this highly static, decidedly odd society.No, the film is not florid; if "Gone With the Wind" is your thing, "Barry Lyndon" probably isn't. The mood IS quite chilly; this movie is far more observational than participatory -- that is, Kubrick is meticulous in documenting the lives these people lead but stands at a distance from his own material, refusing to offer any real judgement or conclusions regarding the proceedings. People who like Kubrick tend to like that stance, but he does take it to an extreme here, and I've shown this film to some friends only to see, in dismay, that it's driving them absolutely nuts. By the one-hour mark, I can always tell whether the person is enthralled or would rather go and get ice cream.But the film has some marvelous touches. Marisa Berenson and O'Neal engage in a kiss that has to be one of the most memorable in screen history; Kubrick draws out the moment as if, instead of working with moving-picture frames, he is constructing the whole thing with paintbrushes.The painting analogy is accurate, by the way, for the whole film. Kubrick wanted to photograph some indoor scenes using only candlelight. He realized this crazy idea partly through the use of one, perhaps two, rather old film cameras sent to him by the film studio. Assuming they were his to keep -- others believed they were lent, not given (!) -- Kubrick proceeded to alter the cameras permanently by having technicians fit them with Zeiss lenses, ultra-high-speed lenses originally developed for NASA! They warned him this would basically wreck the old camera housings, or rather make them useless for any other application -- once the lenses were installed, the cameras could not be restored to their orginal configurations. Kubrick told them to go ahead ... WITHOUT bothering to inform the studio as to what he was doing.The result was a movie featuring some of the most beautiful images ever captured on film. Even detractors of "Barry Lyndon" agree that, visually, this is a landmark in cinema history."Lyndon" also proved, once again, Kubrick's virtuosity; it was preceded by the incredibly violent "A Clockwork Orange," released in 1971, and followed by "The Shining," Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's third novel.I heartily recommend the film, but only to those who still have not been seduced by the ultra-fast pace of our society now.

You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick: He was consistent. Nearly all his films have polarized audiences and critics alike. And nearly all those films have, over time, grown in stature as audiences and critics alike viewed them multiple times, and found more and more to like. Examples of this: "2001: A Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Barry Lyndon," "The Shining" and so on.Add "Eyes Wide Shut" to that list. Indeed, it may have been the most polarizing of all. In fact, it still is -- look at the ratings bestowed by Amazon customers. You'll find lots of five-star nods, yes, but also lots of one-star ratings. This seems to be a love it or hate it film.When it made its theatrical debut in 1999, I must say I was not completely won over. I thought it was a very good film. I wasn't sure it was among Kubrick's best.Now I am. But "Eyes Wide Shut" has taken longer to grow on me than has any other Stanley Kubrick film. In the 13 years since its release, I've probably viewed it half a dozen to a dozen times. Here are some virtues I've found thanks to my repeated viewings:1. This really is a pretty optimistic film. SPOILER ALERT: Despite everything they go through, Bill and Alice Harford decide to stay together. Of course this was evident the first time I saw it, but in many ways the film was so dark and ominous that the couple's talk in the toy store wasn't enough to redeem it from being downbeat. The more I've watched that scene, though, the more love I see in it, and understanding ... and even a bit of sly humor. Certainly it is interesting that it turns out the last word of the last Kubrick film (SPOILER ALERT) turns out to be the f-bomb.2. It's exquisitely structured. This film is downright elegant in the way it's put together. In the opening scenes, the couple is dressing for a party. Said party follows, and couple attends, with both of them flirting with other people. The next night, fueled by some killer weed, Alice Harford makes a startling confession. Her statement completely unnerves Bill. He then embarks on an odyssey that leads him to some strange places, including a prostitute's apartment and an orgy where the filthy-rich guests are masked. Finally, Bill receives a warning; he was not a welcome guest at the orgy, and he is urged to stop asking questions about it lest harm come to his family. He is then confronted by Victor Ziegler, a wealthy patient of his (Harford is a doctor). Ziegler informs Bill he was a participant at the orgy, and emphasizes again that Bill must stop asking questions and try to forget about what he saw.3. No other film I can think of explores the psychology of sexuality as thoroughly and as effectively as "Eyes Wide Shut." Attraction, attachment, jealousy, anger, fear, fulfillment: All these realms are visited. It has taken me all these viewings to appreciate how Kubrick interwove them the way he did.There are many other elements to admire, too. As usual, Kubrick's lighting is just dazzling. The music is aptly disturbing. And Kubrick drew out of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the Harfords, two of the best performances each actor ever has given.If you haven't seen "Eyes Wide Shut," I recommend it. I would make sure you get the uncensored version, without the black CGI figures that were placed in the original theatrical release to secure its R rating. They're extremely distracting and annoying, and the fact is that the simulated sex they masked wasn't all that explicit, compared with what we've seen since.

How did they -- um, that is, how did Stanley Kubrick -- make a movie out of "Lolita"? By playing down the explicit sexual content, which the censors of 1962 apparently could not tolerate, and playing up the tragicomedy.You have to admit: There is something both tragic and funny about Humbert Humbert, including the man's having the same first and last name. Yes, I get the doppelganger reference, but really, how do you take such a person seriously, even if he is a professor. I confess I've always had the same trouble with Ford Madox Ford.Yes, and there's something truly pathetic and very strange about a man of Humbert's age becoming obsessed with a nymphet, even one as precociously flirtatious and brattily manipulative as Lolita.Kubrick didn't have much coice about changing the film for the screen; in fact, he said later that if he knew how difficult it would be, given the salacious subject matter, he might not have attempted it.I'm glad he did, because I think it is one of his most rewarding films. Granted, I didn't like it much at first -- but then again, most Kubrick films benefit from multiple viewings, including this one, "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Barry Lyndon" and "Eyes Wide Shut."Another great thing about this film: The cast. The four principles are, without exception, stunning in their roles. James Mason as Humbert is perfect -- pretentious, hopelessly in love, calculating. Sue Lyon as Lolita brings just the right amount of innocence and sensuality to the role. Shelly Winters is outstanding as Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, and Peter Sellers just dazzles as Clare Quilty, who ultimately serves as Humbert's nemesis.One more point: Despite the film's having to engage in a certain amount of vagueness because of the prudishness of the times, did ANYONE ever miss what was really going on between these two? Mason's performance alone tells the tale for me. He is lecherous, unremorseful in his lechery, thoroughly smitten."Lolita" is a great American film. Again, not my favorite Kubrick movie, but one which stands the test of time, fifty years now since its release.

This is a review of the HDAD version -- similar to DVD-Audio -- of "Who Came First."Contents-wise, I've always thought this was a terrific record. Sure, it's not "anthemic" in the way Townshend's songs typically became when he recorded them with the Who. This album displays a lighter touch, which is probably understandable, since Townshend on his own recorded most of the parts ... and he did not play bass as fluidly as John Entwistle, or drums with the maniacal abandon of Keith Moon.But there's a lot to like here, including Townshend's ethereal version of "Pure and Easy" (recorded by the Who but not released until years later) and a great little tune about homesickness called "Sheraton Gibson."If you have a player that will play it back, the HDAD version of this disc is definitely the way to go. No, it isn't a 5.1 mix, it's stereo, but the increase in sound quality is noticeable -- Townshend's acoustic guitars sound crisper, for one thing. Unfortunately, audiophiles have snapped up all the copies available, so you'd have to buy from a third-party seller, but if you can get a used one for $50 or $60, my opinion is it's still money well-spent.

... not QUITE as good as the Model Masters version, which Testors also makes. This Testors version does have a very slim applicator (you snip the tip off after removing the outer lid), but the Model Masters version of the glue features an even more precise applicator. Still, this is MILES better than the tubes of Testors glue I used as a kid -- believe me, the glue from those had a way of getting all over everything, including (inevitably) the cockpits of the aircraft models I was regularly botching.

This is a worthy sub model by Revell. I had some issues with it but was able to solve any problems that came up ... and this is the first model I've built in many years, since I'm getting back into the hobby for the first time since I was a kid.The molding of the plastic is pretty good, but as with many sub models, getting the hull halves to line up and the decking to fit can be somewhat challenging. Try the fit first without glue, definitely. On the hull pieces, use tape when you do glue them together until the cement sets. One piece of tape fore, aft and in the middle should do it. Otherwise, the bow or stern wants to separate, or at least mine did.The two deck pieces were even more problematic. They fit together fine, but my model had a few gaps between the deck pieces and hull. Nothing severe, but enough to bother me. I used Testors putty to fill in the gaps, sanding it down after it dried. Not bad on the results, although I'm not pleased with the Testors and have ordered some Mr. Surfacer for my next project -- modelers seem to like the results with the latter.The conning tower was easy enough, as were the few details on the deck.Probably my major complaint, though, are Revell's (lack of) instructions regarding paint. Most sub models aren't that challenging; the REAL fun (and realism) derives from the painting scheme. Revell's instructions for this one say to use red, silver and gold. That's it -- that's all you get in the way of info! Gold is for the stand, red for the hull area below the waterline, and silver for the rest. Unfortunately for me, I simply used flat red, even though I suspected the result was going to be far too bright. I wish I'd gone with one of the darker, flatter, hull-red colors offered by companies like Tamiya -- and for my next sub, I'll be spray painting the hull instead of using a brush.With similar misgivings, I used flat silver for the above-the-waterline section. Even so, the boat is just too shiny. NEVER use silver on a warship! I've learned my lesson. I should have ignored the call for silver here and used some kind of flat gray.I've ordered some Testors Dullcote, which should help flatten the finish when I receive the product. Dullcote also seals and protects the finish.By the way: The scale of this boat is 1/180 ... or 1/178, to be exact. Some retailers out there have listed this as 1/220. Don't know why there's this confusion, but amazon has it listed correctly.All in all, I'm fairly pleased with this first effort. I'm working on another Revell kit now -- the 1/72 scale SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane -- and darned if those painting instructions aren't messed up, too! The colors are listed, but there's no key; that is, no way of knowing which color goes where. Fortunately, Revell has updated those instructions; a company rep e-mailed the PDF to me after I contacted Revell via its Web site. Revell is a good company, but I wish they were as careful regarding paint and instructions as is Revell of Germany -- I have a U-boat Type VIIC that I'm going to start soon, and the color key is very precise.

Readers who've objected to this book -- and those who do tend to object rather strenuously -- have focused mostly on its ending, which they have found, at the very least, unsatisfying, and at worst a betrayal of their good faith in a sort of literary partnership with the author. You know, "You, kind sir, write the book, and we will be carried away by your brilliance, insight and gift of language -- but you'd better not go too far."McEwan, in "Atonement," went rather too far for readers who expect linearity and those who get especially attached to their characters. Without revealing what the author does at the end, let's just say that it involves a truly omniscient twist that some regarded as nothing less than cruelty.But guess what? Life can be cruel. And this author knows that, and for this reader's money, has crafted a stunning work of fiction that reveals much about our human predicament. For one thing, if McEwan is correct, it does turn out that perception really is more important, or at least AS important, as reality. A child's perception, in "Atonement," wreaks havoc in several lives. In my own life, I can point to several people whose perceptions damaged me in the extreme. In a couple of those cases, the person in question realized the mistake and took pains to correct it, mitigating or reversing the damage they'd done. In a couple others, the person involved maintained -- against all evidence to the contrary -- their rightness, even though they were brutally wrong. I have lost at least one relationship and one job because of a single person's perceptions, and in both cases, those perceptions had nothing to do with reality.That's why I have defended and even championed this book over the years, recommending it many times to friends and colleagues. In addition to calling attention to the vagaries of perception, it just happens to be beautifully written. And yes, the characters are so wonderfully and completely drawn that when their "true" fates are revealed, we feel the loss as gut-wrenching, almost intolerable.But I suspect that was the author's intent.If you value true honesty in your fiction choices, and if you are a reader inclined to take things more philosophically than strictly emotionally, I think you will find great value in this book.

I enjoy going back to this movie on a regular basis for more viewings; it's that good. In fact, "Crimson Tide" has to rank as one of the greatest submarine movies ever, in company with "Das Boot," "The Enemy Below," "The Hunt for Red October" and the sadly underrated "K-19: The Widowmaker."I've knocked off a star because I'm a submarine fanatic and know there are some inaccuracies here. For more on that subject, read the review here tagged as being written by a "real submariner." He makes some valid points that potential viewers might want to consider in deciding whether to see the film. None of the innacuracies bothered me very much, but they are there.Basically, though, I have to say that the great performances and tight direction win the day. Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, Viggo Mortensen and George Dzundza as, respectively, the captain, executive officer, weapons officer and chief of the boat are no less than spectacular, and the supporting cast is excellent as well. The late Tony Scott directed, and while he's probably best-known for "Top Gun," I think "Crimson Tide" and "True Romance" are his best films.The situation set up by the script is enough to put anyone on the edge of his or her seat: In post-Soviet Russia, a possible coup is in progress, and rebels may or may not be successful in fueling land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. If they do, they could fire them at the United States.The USS Alabama, an Ohio-class SSBN, or ballistic missile submarine, is sent to sea along with other "boomers" placed on alert during the crisis (SSBN stands for "ship, submersible, ballistic, nuclear".) Unfortunately, the boat's XO has come down with appendicitis, so Capt. Frank Ramsey (Hackman) must choose a replacement: Ron Hunter (Washington), a lieutenant commander with more theoretical knowledge than combat experience.The Alabama receives orders to launch its nuclear missiles. Minutes later, a second message begins to come in -- but is cut off during a time of confusion, as the Alabama is being attacked by a Russian sub. Hunter argues that the Alabama should try to re-establish radio contact to see if the second order countermanded the first. Ramsey disagrees, saying that the second message is not a legitimate message at all but only a "message fragment." He feels the Alabama must waste no time in striking at the Russian rebels. Hunter refuses to concur -- and states that, according to the rules under which SSBNs operate, the Alabama cannot launch unless he agrees with the Captain. After an angry confrontation, Hunter orders the chief of the boat (Dzundza) to arrest Capt. Ramsey and confine him to his quarters.The story ratchets up from there, in a sequence of events so tense and gripping that it's impossible to lose focus. Supporters of Ramsey try to come to his aid, even as Hunter's supporters seek to slow everything down till the Alabama can fix its communications gear and receive the rest of the "message fragment.""Crimson Tide" is a relentless thriller. One last observation: The special effects are terrific -- much better than those achieved earlier by "The Hunt for Red October."

As I wrote in my review of the companion two-volume set: Quite a few fans of Sherlock Holmes grew up reading the annotated version of the stories featuring the famous "consulting detective," courtesy of an erudite soul named William S. Baring-Gould. Baring-Gould's "The Annotated Sherlock Holmes" was published in 1967, the year he died. I still have it, and have been reading it since acquiring a copy of the two-volume set in the mid-1970s. It was then and is now a wonderful reading experience -- the text of the stories flanked by helpful annotations. Don't know what a dog cart is, for example? Baring-Gould supplied you with an informative -- and often charming and witty -- note about it.But clearly, it was time for an update. Enter "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes," a project overseen by Leslie S. Klinger, a lawyer and writer. Basically, Klinger shows the same respect for the Holmes canon as did Baring-Gould, but offers new annotations and insights gleaned from all the Holmes scholarship that has taken place in the four decades since Baring-Gould died.I refrain from giving it four stars for just one reason: Baring-Gould's "Annotated Sherlock Holmes" was a two-volume set containing all 56 short stories and all four Holmes novels. Klinger, though, wrote many more annotations for his new version, which has resulted in the short stories being published in a separate two-volume box, and the four novels split off into their own one-volume edition. Personally, I think this is more marketing (and more money) than anything else. Then again, those who love annotations, explanations, footnotes, amplifications and musings are going to be nothing but delighted.And yes, I confess that despite my objection, I did buy it all. Given all the information here, it's clear that most Holmes aficionados will find these volumes well worth the price. For others who may have a more casual interest, there are cheaper complete editions out there -- but you gets what you pays for, yes?

The real-life Charles Starkweather's 1950s murder spree inspired "Badlands," but that doesn't change the fact that this film is very much Terrence Malick's. As with his other works, the cinematography is almost a character unto itself, there is voice-over narration by one of the characters, and the filmmaker tries hard to impose a sense of epic on a story involving a handful of people.Whether Malick succeeds or not is very much in the eye of the beholder -- and this, too, reflects his other films, including "Days of Heaven" and "The Tree of Life." Movie lovers tend to love or hate this director. Detractors say he's pretentious, overbearing; supporters speak of the lyricism and sweeping ambition of his films. I personally am a Malick fan, having been won over long ago by the man's imagination and bravery.If you're not familiar with his work, "Badlands" is the place to start, partly because it's arguably the most direct and accessible of his films. The performances by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are nearly flawless, which doesn't hurt. Highly recommended, with the caveat that your mileage may vary. ;)

Basically, here's the deal on this album: If you're a big fan of Frank Zappa's sprawling, often amazing instrumental work -- I'm talking about the guitar solo on "Watermelon in Easter Hay," for example -- or the long, sinuous workouts with his band that BARELY feature vocals, such as "Yo Mama" ... well, then you might be disappointed with this record. If, on the other hand, you're a fan of, or at least can tolerate, Zappa's often bizarre sense of humor, you should find a home for this record."Zoot Allures" does sport three fine instrumentals, including the outstanding "Black Napkins," which onstage over the years became a showcase for FZ and whatever musicians were working with him at the time. But most of the stuff here features Zappa's vocals and aforementioned cracked funnybone. "Wind Up Workin' in a Gas Station" is actually rather funny, in a sad sort of way, depicting life as seen from the viewpoint of some poor dunce whose career prospects are always going to be limited to saying, "Fill 'er up?" "Ms. Pinky" is funny if you think sex dolls are funny. And "Disco Boy" is funny especially if you are of an age to remember characters like this one; my favorite line in the song is "run to the toilet, honey, comb your hair."The strangest song of all here is undoubtedly "The Torture Never Stops," which sounds like "The Silence of the Lambs" meets "Real Sex." It starts off in a genuinely harrowing fashion, with a deep, scary Zappa vocal that includes lines like, "Flies all green and buzzin' / in this dungeon of despair." As we move into the guitar solo, though (and what a monster it is), the groans and screams of the female being tortured turn from what sounds like pain to what sounds like ... um ... rather unrestrained enjoyment. It's always been rather puzzling to me, but the song has garnered some dedicated fans over the years. I used to have a friend, in fact, who would BEG me to play it every time he came over to my house. I finally bought him his own copy of the record."Zoot Allures" would not be tops on my list of Zappa albums to own; those would include "Hot Rats," "Joe's Garage," "Sleep Dirt" and some of his early, Mothers of Invention stuff. But it's still a fine record. I wouldn't recommend playing it around kids -- though I do make, at this time, a confession: I got hold of this album when I was about 16 and, after extorting promises of "OK, but don't tell Mom and Dad," used to let my 9-year-old brother listen to PARTS of it with me, including "Gas Station" and "Disco Boy," both of which always reduced him to great, gasping shrieks of laughter. The fact that I WORKED in a gas station at the time, and that our sister was dragging home the occasional disco-boy loser as (temporary) boyfriend, certainly must have stoked the appeal for him. Hey, it was the '70s. Things were goofy, and Zappa, who no matter what he was doing always seemed to have a good grasp of the Zeitgeist, knew it.

I've always liked Roger Daltrey; I think he's been a great front man for the Who. Tougher than Jagger, rougher than Plant, but still capable of delivering some very powerful and emotional vocals, especially on Who efforts such as "Who's Next" and (of course) "Tommy."Unfortunately, Daltrey's solo albums never fared as well, partly because he wasn't singing songs by a certain Mr. Townshend. But "One of the Boys" is a welcome exception. I recently purchased this on vinyl, partly because I used to have the original and partly because ... I admit it -- I like this album cover.But it's the songs that win the day, from the introspective "Parade" to the high energy of "Avenging Annie." Daltrey's in great voice here, and the set of songs is top-notch. He co-writes a few of the tracks, too, and does a very credible job of it indeed.Who fans should like this, of course, but anyone who enjoys classic rock will, too.

I had forgotten how incredibly appealing this album really is until a recent vinyl renaissance that has had me exploring older titles. "Chicago VI" is a chops-laden, mostly optimistic piece of pop craftsmanship that sometimes rises to brilliance.The brilliance surfaces immediately, on Robert Lamm's caustic "Critic's Choice," in which he takes to task the band's detractors. By the time of this album, there were many of them, who apparently saw the band's AM radio single successes as undermining any legitimate claim the group could have staked via the more "serious" album-oriented FM side. Lamm responds not with a full band arrangement but with a simple vocal-and-piano song. It works beautifully because it's so personal and because it comes from the man who, at the time, was arguably Chicago's leader. He was the dominant songwriter, at any rate, and here he writes:"What do you want?What do you want?I'm givin' everything I haveI'm even trying to see if there's moreLocked deep insideI'll tryI'll try...What do you need?What do you need?Is it someone just to hurtSo that you can appear to be smart?...Play GodPlay GodWhat do you really know?You parasite ..."I know; I don't have much use for some critics, either, but had Lamm left it there, the result would have been outright bitterness instead of justifiable complaint. Toward the end of the song, he returns to the "I'll try, I'll try" theme -- certainly the sign of a mature artist who, despite feeling wronged, also knows the only way forward is to keep searching and striving.Not everything is as pleasing here. I've pretty much lost respect for trombonist James Pankow over the years for his hit-mongering, but I have to say his "Just You 'N Me" here does constitute really sweet ear candy. Unfortunately, Pankow's "What's This World Comin' To?" is harder-driven but less carefully crafted, and his collaboration with Peter Cetera, "Feelin' Stronger Every Day" -- well, the outro features that yammering, Bee Gees vocal style that always drove me nuts.Cetera's solo composition "In Terms of Two," though, was much juicier than some of the empty hits he would offer the band later; this little countrified song features harmonicas and a pedal steel part played by a session musician, plus a nice shuffle beat from drummer Danny Seraphine.The rest of the album, with one exception, was written by Robert Lamm. That one exception, though, was guitarist's Terry Kath's "Jenny," yet another brilliant piece by him. Kath wasn't Chicago's most prolific writer, but the rest of the band regarded him as the band's soul, and this ballad is about as soulful as it gets -- the Jenny in the song is not the persona's lover but rather a female friend, and the writer is asking Jenny to watch over his girlfriend as he leaves town -- on a tour, a trip, whatever. Kath's relationship songs always were intricate -- check out "Byblos" on Chicago VII -- but the writer of "Jenny" could easily stand a year or two in therapy. There's so much pent-up love, fear, jealousy and anger here that it's difficult to see how Kath squeezed it all into a mere pop song -- and there's just a hint of lesbianism, too, or at least the persona's fear or intrigue regarding it.As stated, Lamm's songs fill out the album, and how he could be this productive and spot-on despite having written 80 percent of "Chicago V" is surprising. But he's in fine, somewhat dark-edged form here, from the "are we really friends" motif of "Darlin' Dear" to the firm but somehow gentle -- or at least justifiable -- denunciations of celebrity culture in "Hollywood" and "Something In This City Changes People." Finally, there's Lamm's "Rediscovery," the penultimate track on the album, a luscious and rather mysterious keyboard-driven ballad in which the singer lusts after the rebirth of experience, a "new oblivion.""Chicago VI" has been viewed by some as the band playing it safe; I disagree. Any record this exploratory isn't just a mere pop record. Well worth hearing.

When it comes to ambition, the band first known to the world as the Chicago Transit Authority couldn't be found lacking. At a time when many rock bands were four-piece outfits (guitars, bass, drums, keyboards), the CTA arrived on the late-1960s music scene as a seven-piece lineup, supplementing the usual instruments with a horn section consisting of a trombonist, trumpeter and woodwinds player. At a time when the standard release was one LP (that's long-play record to you digital kiddies), the CTA's debut album was a two-disc set. And a time when jazz and big band were not being heard, for the most part, by a popular audience, CTA was all over the radio with music that fused rock with those forms, and to great success."CTA" was outrageously good, for the most part. The songs:"Introduction": Written by guitarist Terry Kath, this song was the perfect opening number and, yes, introduction to the band. The jaunty lyrics announced the presence of this act even as the singer (Kath himself) admitted, "We're a little nervous." The music sounded like Stan Kenton meets the Spencer Davis Group."Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" Keyboardist Robert Lamm's song began with an odd but strangely compelling "free-form" piano solo."Beginnings": This was another Lamm song, opening with a breezy acoustic guitar part. Lyrically, it was a pretty standard love song, but the band delivered it with such gusto, and Lamm sang it so convincingly, that the cliches didn't matter."Questions 67 and 68": Another relationship song written by Lamm, sung by Lamm with bassist Peter Cetera. I still don't know EXACTLY what questions 67 and 68 might be, but I don't care, either -- clearly, it's from the point of view of someone excited by the prospect of commitment, but a person who also has lots of fears and questions."Listen": A short, punchy song by Lamm, driven by Kath's distorted electric guitar. Lamm declares that if people think the band is just here for the money ... well, they could be making lots more money doing other things (this would quickly change for Chicago, to be sure, as their hits started piling up)."Poem 58": A long, smoldering song from Lamm, a strong declaration of love. The title is a total mystery to me, but maybe Lamm was trying to suggest just how difficult it was for him to write something like this, to express himself in the face of something as profound as love."Free Form Guitar": Well ... what can I say? This is six minutes and forty-seven seconds of Terry Kath making the most howling, obnoxious, anti-melodic music he could possibly wrench out of his electric guitar. Virtuosic? Undoubtedly. But all these years later, it's a pretty hard listen, frankly -- even more soaked in feedback and noise than Jimi Hendrix's take on "The Star-Spangled Banner.""South California Purples": Essentially a slow blues song by Lamm; the clever title refers to the band's relocation from Chicago, where they formed, and the blues of that city, to the smog-infested, purplish skies of Los Angeles."I'm a Man": Kath, Cetera and Lamm trade vocals on the Spencer Davis Group classic, penned by Steve Winwood and Jimmy Miller."Prologue (August 29, 1968)": Sound effects from protestors at the 1968 Democratic Convention ("the whole world's watching ... the whole world's watching") credited to producer James William Guercio."Someday (August 29, 1968)": Lamm and trombonist Jimmy Pankow cowrote this song inspired by the '68 Democratic National Convention. An ominous song about political upheaval and personal sacrifice, sung by Lamm and Cetera."Liberation": The album's closer is Pankow's mostly instrumental showcase for the band's playing abilities. The exception comes nearly 13 minutes into the 14-1/2-minute song as Kath sings, "Whoa, thank you, people." It sounds absurd but his deep, soulful baritone voice made it work. And the horn section -- Pankow along with trumpeter Lee Loughnane and sax/flute man Walt Parazaider -- are at their brazen best on this one.Summary:The politics of the album certainly sound dated now -- both in the societal sense but also the personal sense. It was the 1960s, after all, and peace, love and revolution were in the air. Musically, though, "CTA" sounds remarkably fresh. Every member of the band plays well on it, but especially notable are Cetera's bass parts and Danny Seraphine's drumming, which is very aggressive here but would be toned down as CTA became known simply as Chicago, and the band became more interested in AM radio hits over FM radio airplay.Highly recommended.

I first bought this as a teenager, back in the late 1970s. I was very into Chicago at the time -- this was before the band lost guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Terry Kath, who in early 1978 accidentally shot himself to death with a pistol he thought was unloaded.Now, keep in mind that this was in the days long before compact disc -- and also long before you could find just about anything you wanted online, because there WAS NO ONLINE. I had heard rumors that there was an album Chicago had released only in Japan, of a live performance in that country that was supposedly far superior to "Chicago at Carnegie Hall."So, one fine afternoon, I walked into Caper's Corner in Kansas City, Kansas (one of the finest record stores, when those existed, in the entire country), and they had a copy on hand. It was expensive but I bought it anyway.What a revelation! The sound on "Carnegie Hall" had been terrible; it was excellent on this release. In addition, the band sounds more rested and thus more robust -- they had been touring relentlessly at the time "Carnegie Hall" had been recorded, but finally had taken some time to recharge the batteries, and it shows -- the horns in particular sound more muscular."Live in Japan" also benefitted from the inclusion of four songs from the recently released "Chicago V" -- "Dialogue," "A Hit by Varese," "State of the Union" and "Saturday in the Park," all written by keyboardist Robert Lamm. The set also included "Mississippi Delta City Blues," a great song by Terry Kath that didn't make the cut for "Chicago V" but wound up later as the opening track on "Chicago XI.""Live in Japan" featured trombonist James Pankow's seven-part suite "Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon" that was far superior to the one on "Chicago at Carnegie Hall."In essence, "Chicago Live in Japan" is analogous to Led Zeppelin's "How the West Was Won." That is, it's a live recording that's much better than the one that was released "officially" back in the 1970s. In Zep's case, that was "The Song Remains the Same," which was the soundtrack to their film of the same name. "Song" did not show Zeppelin at its best. "How the West Was Won," released decades later, showed what that band really could do live. Same with "Chicago Live in Japan '72," which was released back in the day but was very hard for fans to find.Sadly, the cost of obtaining "Chicago Live in Japan" now is prohibitive. There's a CD version selling for quite a bit of money here on amazon, and a 2012 remastered import that's pricy, too. I elected to buy the mp3 version, despite my dislike of the mp3 format. Meanwhile, I think I'm going to seek out a copy of the old double vinyl album.

It's hard to believe some of the releases from this part of Neil Young's career got such mixed reviews. Alas, there's been lots of critical reappraisal (read: 20/20 hindsight) since those days, and "On the Beach" now is accepted as being right up there with some of the best discs of Young's career, including "Zuma" and "Tonight's the Night."Look out, though: For fans of prettified Neil, this ain't "Harvest" or "Silver and Gold." Yet it isn't nearly as noisy as "Zuma" or as raw as "Tonight's the Night," either. The first half of the album is witty, bizarre and very entertaining; the songs include "See the Sky About to Rain" and the hoarse but heartfelt "For the Turnstiles."The second half (side 2, back in vinyl days) is simply one of the great turns in Young's career. "On the Beach," "Motion Pictures" and "Ambulance Blues" constitute a trilogy of slow-tempo, reflective songs that nevertheless have tremendous emotional power and considerable darkness. In its way, each of these pieces also asserts Young's amazing independence as an artist. He will do things his own way, even if, at times, that stubborn insistence ends up irritating his collaborators and even his fans. The title track's lyrics perfectly encapsulate Young's love/hate relationship with stardom: "I need a crowd of people," Young sings," but I can't face them day to day." Hell's bells, Neil ... who can? :) "Motion Pictures" is the gentlest of these three songs, and was dedicated to actress Carrie Snodgrass, with whom Young had a son, Zeke, but this isn't a simple romance ballad. A sample from the lyrics: "Motion pictures on my TV screen, / A home away from home, livin' in between." The song, while clearly expressing love, also delves into self-doubt, the nature of stardom, and more.Finally, the album concludes with "Ambulance Blues," one of the finest pieces of rock music I've ever heard. In it, Young addresses critics directly, calling them out for being no better than him or anyone else despite their haughty pronouncements. And there's a verse, repeated, that many feel directly referenced Richard Nixon, the disgraced politician who in 1974 became the only U.S. president ever to resign from office:"I never knew a mancould tell so many liesHe had a different storyfor every set of eyes.How can he rememberwho he's talkin' to?'Cause I know it ain't me,and I hope it isn't you.""Ambulance Blues" doesn't end so much as it just stops, kind of falling apart musically with a sigh of harmonica and soft percussion. But it's a brilliant ending -- Young, despite all the issues he's addressed on this album, knows better to proclaim that he's resolved any great mysteries.Final note: Some reviewers here have complained that the DVD-Audio version of this album is presented in two-track (stereo) only. This was deliberate on Young's part, as he wanted the highest resolution possible for the two-channel mix. Thus, no surround here, which has irked some folks. Upon buying the disc and getting it home, I was perplexed and rather annoyed. Over time, though, I've come to appreciate it just the way it is. This is a stark, revealing mix of one of Young's most harrowing and yet winning albums. Highly recommended.

...still enjoyable. I picked up this game for cheap because I wanted to see what the first version of Quake looked like, which I'd never played. It's very, very primitive by modern standards, but would be of interest to anyone who wants to see the evolution of what has become a major gaming franchise.

This isn't the happiest film in the world -- far from it -- but it's very well done and leaves a lasting impression. I was leery of it; it's based on J.M. Coetzee's novel of the same name, and that novel won the Booker Prize. Props to the filmmakers and to John Malkovich, who gives an amazing performance.

"Spartacus" is, at its heart, a film born out of conflict between its star, Kirk Douglas, and its director, Stanley Kubrick. That conflict, in fact, would become so intense that it led to a permanent rift between the two men.Kubrick was brought onto the picture by Douglas after the actor fired director Anthony Mann. In addition, the screenplay (by Dalton Trumbo) was already finished, whereas Kubrick had already gotten used to the idea of helping to develop the story at hand himself.One of Kubrick's main objections, apparently, was that the character of Spartacus was just too perfect -- a man without serious flaws or defects.Well, what a classic confrontation, right? Actor wants to play a purely heroic character, while director wants to complicate things a bit more.Douglas basically got his way. This is not surprising; he had a lot of power at the time. Also, "Spartacus" was released in 1960. The moviegoing public's view of film heroes, it could be argued, was much closer to Douglas' simple take than it was to Kubrick's richer, more complex stance.In the end, though, Douglas and Kubrick created a brilliant film. First of all, you just can't take your eyes off it -- the scenery, the cinematography, the absolute grandeur and spectacle of it all. The film featured a cast of more than 10,000, including 8,000 real soldiers.And the performances! Douglas, but also Lawrence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov -- all delivered the goods in this one.I do fault the film for being overly long, but with its running time of more than three hours, it was a harginger of Kubrick films to come.Partly because of its running length, this is not a film I watch as often as some Kubrick movies in my collection -- yet I always end up enjoying it, especially the genuinely moving final scene.

John Wyndham, pen name for John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (no wonder he shortened it), was one of the most talented British science fiction writers ever to work in the genre. He died in 1969 and, unfortunately, he's not being read or recognized these days the way he deserves.This collection represents one of the author's finest works. The title story, in particular, is unforgettable: A woman wakes up in a distant future in which men no longer exist. Women have learned to reproduce and perpetuate the human species without them -- and are not sorry they're gone, either! Men were, they explain, violent and uncontrollable. Our heroine tries to argue otherwise, but begins to have doubts herself -- and also wonders about her own sanity, given her very strange circumstances. I won't give away the conclusion, but it is a MARVELOUS tale. Also: I'm CONVINCED the film "12 Monkeys" ripped off this story without giving credit where it was due.Wyndham also was the author of "The Midwich Cuckoos," which was filmed (twice, I believe) as "Village of the Damned," and I recommend it very highly as well.

My significant other insisted I watch this movie; I would've passed on it otherwise. I'm glad I did -- it was very well done, and appropriately creepy, disturbing etc.It's undeniable in its eye-candy appeal. My only criticism is that it could have been shorter, but then again, that would have detracted from the deliberately "videogame" feel of the whole thing.I never thought I'd be writing a positive review of a film based on a game, but there you go. Special treat: Those oddly sensual but still horrific dancing nurses! Man, what an image!

... this is a pretty fine album by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. I especially like the fact that I get the distinct feeling I'm listening to a TRULY live album rather than, say, "Eagles Live," the 1980 disc rumored to have been subjected to so many studio overdubs during postproduction that it isn't really "live" at all.You can hear, for example, a few slurry notes -- and even a couple of outright mistakes -- from keyboardist Keith Emerson on the opening track "Hoedown." You can hear, on "Take A Pebble," vocalist/bassist sliding up to a note on one phrase where it sounds like he was on the verge of going flat. And Carl Palmer -- surely one of the greatest drummers of his generation -- actually rushes the beat a little on one section of "Toccata."These are the things, actually, that help make live performances memorable. It isn't that these guys, virtuosos one and all, are screwing up badly; it's just that they're dealing with the stage environment, where nerves, fatigue, distraction and other elements sometimes come into play.Overall, the performances are just brilliant. I've always been impressed by Emerson's ability to handle multiple keyboard parts; here, he routinely holds down an organ part while playing a Moog synthesizer solo, or vice versa -- and sometimes does this while covering the bass line with his feet, if Lake happened to be playing guitar instead of bass at that moment. As for Lake, he's somewhat underrated as a bassist. People like Chris Squire of Yes and the late John Entwistle of the Who got more attention over the years, but Lake is a fine player in his own right; the Who, in fact, called upon Lake to provide the bass part for a song called "Old Red Wine" after Entwistle's death. And Lake's tone is excellent, mixing in low rumbling and mid-range growl. Palmer is just a joy to listen to, as he blends jazz phrasing and classical flourishes with a heavier rock touch.Standouts on this disc: A complete performance of "Tarkus," the sidelong composition from the band's second album; an excellent arrangement of Lake's "Take A Pebble" that incorporates "Lucky Man" and "Still ... You Turn Me On"; and, best of all, a complete (even a little extended) performance of "Karn Evil 9," the band's masterful epic that appeared on "Brain Salad Surgery."Live albums succeed or fail based not only on the musical performances but also on the mood the band establishes or fails to establish. On this disc, ELP clearly are having a good time, and so is the audience. I recommend it.

This disc was produced by Alexander Jero. As with a lot of the releases involving this person, the inserts and the disc itself look very amateurish, even perhaps homemade? The music itself, performed by Yuki and Tomoko Mack, is fine but not often inspired -- the technical skills seem OK, but theirs is a rather cool interpretation of a piece that's supposed to be an outpouring of the American spirit. And the multichannel format here is like an Oscar-winning actor in a pointless cameo; seriously, what was the purpose here, given the sparse instrumentation?But the real problem: As other reviewers here have found, Mr. Jero apparently cannot even be bothered to make a product that actually plays. A few minutes into track 2, the music went silent even though my BD player indicated the track was still playing. I checked connections, examined the disc and restarted the track. Same result.I sent this back. What a RIP-OFF.

I guess I should confess up front that I'm a sucker for this subject, having been keenly interested in military submarines for quite some time. Still, I was surprised by and delighted with how good this book really is.Author Robert Kurson is a natural storyteller and a good writer with an excellent sense of how to pace a book. In "Shadow Divers," he focuses mostly on the events at hand -- a group of divers trying to verify the discovery of a World War II U-boat -- but also makes room in his narrative to establish the characters of the people involved.The result is a really gripping book, although sometimes quite harrowing. This is a great sea story; I think it compares well with Sebastian Junger's now-classic "The Perfect Storm."Kurson has been taken to task on some accuracy issues by a self-published writer. I have not read the other man's work so can't judge it first-hand, but it really does look like "sour grapes" to me, based on what I can see from quite a number of amazon reviews. I highly recommend "Shadow Divers," but that is the great thing about books: To each his own.

"There was simply no one like him," Bonnie Raitt said of guitarist Michael Hedges following his untimely death in a 1997 car accident, and that short statement still rings with truth. Michael Alden Hedges -- just 29 days short of his 44th birthday when he died -- was a very gifted performer, arranger and composer whose music sounded like nothing that had come before it.Not that Hedges, whose main instrument was acoustic guitar, didn't have influences. Listen closely to his playing and you can hear tinges of Leo Kottke, John Fahey and others. But Hedges took acoustic guitar to new places, thanks to a busy but effective style that involved tapping on the fingerboard and percussive slaps to the guitar body as well as picking and strumming.Other guitarists playing solo sound like ... well, like guitarists playing solo, although there are exceptions like Kottke, especially when he plays 12-string. Hedges playing solo sounded like a guitar ensemble or one-man symphony."Aerial Boundaries" is not his only great album -- listeners also should seek out "Taproot" and "Oracle" -- but it's probably his best. The instrumentals here made a statement that is still being heard, by fans and guitarists alike. The title track and "Rickover's Dream" are the standouts, but even the slighter pieces like "Bensusan" are beautifully wrought.Go searching for quotes about Hedges and you'll find great admiration expressed for him by the likes of Steve Vai, Alvin Lee and the Who's Pete Townshend.Finally, on a personal note: I got to know Hedges a little bit, thanks to circumstances that I won't go into here, except to say that I was fortunate enough to enjoy a professional relationship with him over several years' time. I can say that he was gracious, affable, very funny and a gentleman through and through -- in fact, offstage he was very much like he was onstage. I saw him perform more times than I can count now. In addition to his great musicianship, I miss his warmth, and also his genuine concern for his fellow human beings and for the Earth itself.

I have some conservative friends who would, I think, have about four strokes apiece if they read Philip Jose' Farmer's "Riders of the Purple Wage." HERE is a welfare state depicted in all its sagging, wallowing glory. In Farmer's future world, there ARE no jobs. There is only -- well, for the most part -- idiocy. The populace, freed of the responsibilities of work, does exactly what you'd think such a populace would do: Nothing. Or rather its equivalent -- watching the futuristic version of television.Oh, it gets better -- or bitter, depending on your viewpoint. Artists and critics are societal darlings. Sexuality has become, um, very ... FREE, indeed. And along those lines, there is something called the "fornixator," a scientific development that apparently makes masturbation unnecessary. All the pleasure without all the work!For those willing to read and receive, though, there is much to admire here. The lead character, Grandpa Winnegan, is one of the most memorable in all of science fiction, and it doesn't hurt that he's incredibly funny, too.Finally, "Riders of the Purple Wage" just may contain the greatest play on words in 20th century fiction of any kind, and I'm NOT talking about the title. When I read it for the first time, my jaw literally dropped. It's a fine, fine moment in a very good SF novel.

Having owned and watched (repeatedly) the "Classic Albums" making-of DVD about "Dark Side of the Moon," I was skeptical about "Pink Floyd: The Story of Wish You Were Here." The "Dark Side" documentary was very well-done -- one of the best in that series, which also includes an excellent look at the birth of the Who's "Who's Next." But I was absolutely bowled over by "The Story of Wish You Were Here," and even learned some things I hadn't known about my all-time favorite Pink Floyd album.The interviews with band members David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Roger Waters are a natural element, of course, as are the archival Q-and-A's with keyboardist Rick Wright, who died in 2008. But the producers went beyond the band, including moments with engineer Brian Humphries, guest vocalist Roy Harper, and even stuntman Ronnie Rondell, who was the "burning man" on the original WYWH cover.I suppose I must have read at some point how Gilmour's mournful, four-note guitar phrase was so important to the composition of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond," but here, both Waters and Gilmour seem to be in agreement that this little snippet of music came early and influenced, basically, the entire construction of that epic song.Very nice it is, too, to watch as the documentary cuts back and forth between Gilmour and Waters each singing and playing on acoustic guitars his own contemporary version of the album's title track, "Wish You Were Here." Gilmour was filmed playing a lush rythm part on 12-string guitar, and solo notes on 6-string, while Waters picks out the entire tune on a black 6-string acoustic. I've always preferred Gilmour's warmer voice to Waters', but the latter's has aged well -- Waters' range has dropped, as can happen with older singers, but in his case it's been a blessing. His rendering of the song here -- his restrained, almost whispered delivery, and his wonderfully clipped, wistful phrasing -- reminded me very much of Bob Dylan at his best.It's a marvelous performance, starker and far more ghostly than Gilmour's rich rendering, but it holds its own. It's a reminder that these guys, when they were at their best and before their creative differences made it impossible for them to keep working together, brought distinct but needed skills to Pink Floyd. Waters was ever the intellectual, the gifted, philosophical lyricist, and Gilmour the powerful, more musical counterpart. Adding in Wright's soulful keys and voice, and Mason's rather jazzy drumming and humorous demeanort, and you had a group of four musicians who all had a hand in establishing Pink Floyd as one of the greatest bands in rock history.This video made me appreciate that all over again -- and also made me long to be young again, and to mourn ... again ... the tragic downfall of original Floyd singer/guitarist Syd Barrett, whose descent into madness inspired the entire "Wish You Were Here" album. Those days, from the band's first record in 1967 to the recording and release of "Wish You Were Here" in 1975, were strange, powerful, heady days indeed.

I used to listen to this album more than any other release by Chicago. This was back in my teens, so my tastes definitely have changed in the three-plus decades since then. And maybe it's inevitable that we perceive things differently as we age.Still, "Chicago II," as it came to be known, hasn't worn well with me in the last few years. I don't like it now nearly as much "Chicago Transit Authority I," the band's debut. Musically, the songs lack the edginess of those on the first album, and lyrically, Chicago's political pretensions get rather out of control here.That said, the first side (to use old vinyl terminology) is great. Trombonist James Pankow's "Movin' In" makes for a nice mid-tempo opener, while guitarist Terry Kath offers two fine songs, "The Road" and "In the Country." Keyboardist Robert Lamm's first song on the album is the more pensive "Poem for the People."It's side two where things begin to go wrong. Lamm's "Wake Up Sunshine" is pretty forgettable soft pop. It's followed by Pankow's "Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon," a seven-part suite that takes up the rest of the side. It has some nice moments, including "Make Me Smile," but it also features "Colour My World." The latter, over the years, would be sung at countless proms and high school graduations, and would become my least favorite Chicago track.Side three is better, featuring two good Lamm songs including the classic "25 or 6 to 4," plus a surprisingly tender four-song suite written by Kath with Peter Matz called "Memories of Love."Rarely, these days, can I get through side four, which is dominated by Lamm's four-part "It Better End Soon." It's not that I disagree now, or ever did, with the song's anti-war sentiments. But there's little subltety here, musically or lyrically. Kath always has been one of my favorite guitartists, but his playing on the intro song, "1st Movement," is downright aggravating.Yet this remains one of the band's most popular albums, and one of only two, along with "Chicago V," that was remixed in 5.1-channel sound for DVD Audio. That's the version to get if you have the gear to play it and the wallet to afford it; it's out of print and very expensive now.

I wasn't too keen on Aerosmith at first -- and growing up in the 1970s, if you weren't too keen on Aerosmith, you probably weren't too cool, either, according to your friends. The band was hugely popular with the blue-jean set back then, especially males -- if memory serves me right, the band used to refer to its three-fourths-male concert audiences as "the blue army."Part of my problem was I really did think some of the critics were right: Aerosmith was just Rolling Stones Lite. Certainly, there was an influence. But my other problem was the songs ... or lack of them. "Dream On," from the first album, was OK till singer Stephen Tyler reached the Shriekosphere near the song's end. "Mama Kin" was mildly engaging. But much of the rest of that first record just didn't sound that appealing. "Get Your Wings," the second album, did little to sway me.But when "Toys in the Attic" came out in 1975, even I had to admit it: The band had kicked it up not just a NOTCH but about three or four of 'em. The songs were amazing: "Walk This Way" and "Uncle Salty" and "No More, No More." There was a cover, too, of a nasty old blues song called "Big Ten-Inch Record" that was just hilarious good fun.And then there was "Sweet Emotion," the best song of the band's career at that point. From Tom Hamilton's boiling bass line to the crunching guitars of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford to Joey Kramer's killer drums to Tyler's spot-on lead vocal, it was a perfect rock anthem. And Tyler was keeping his voice in a slightly lower range, so that he sounded more growly than girly.And speaking of girls: My memory also says this is where Aerosmith's fan base started to shift. Young women started going to the shows with their boyfriends, and buying the records. Aerosmith was held in very high esteem, in fact, by my first serious girlfriend. Sweet young lady; she even forgave me for spilling beer one time on their "Greatest Hits" album. In fact, it pretty much started our relationship -- she thought I was a funny klutz, and stopped me from wincing and trying to clean off the album by putting me in a lip-lock I'll never forget.This may be my favorite Aerosmith album, and "Sweet Emotion" definitely is my favorite song in their repertoire. Note: If you're an SACD person, the SACD version is worth getting. The surround mix is spacious and revealing without being too pretty. In other words, it still sounds like rock and roll. "Sweet Emotion" is especially nice, with the percussion and talk-box vocals that start the piece loitering in the surround speakers while Hamilton's bass churns it up out front. The SACD is long out of print and very, very pricy now. Two recommendations: Pony up the money and get one. And never sell it!

Jeff Beck has had an interesting career, to say the least. Regarded by many guitarists as perhaps the most technically gifted player ever to pick up the instrument, Beck's public profile has always been a bit lower than that of, say, Pete Townshend of the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Duane Allman, or Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton. (Clapton, Beck and Page, by the way, were the three major lead guitarists who were, at one time or another, members of the Yardbirds.)One reason Beck isn't as well-known: His inability to keep a band together. Beck, by most accounts, has shown some rather wicked temper over the years. Another reason, though, and perhaps more pertinent: Increasingly over the years, he has focused on instrumental music. Apparently, life on Planet JB is easier without some lead singer whining about not getting enough attention. And the American record-buying public, more so than its UK counterpart, has never been as interested in instrumental rock as it has been rock with vocals.Still, Beck has managed to have himself a pretty fine career; now and then he's even managed to chart some singles, including remakes of "Superstition" and "People Get Ready."For most hardcore Beck fans, though, it is his instrumental albums that offer the most compelling listening experiences. And "There and Back," released in 1980, is a superb example of what Beck does when he's at his best.The first three songs on this outing feature keyboards from Jan Hammer -- yes, the guy who wrote the "Miami Vice" theme, but ALSO the guy who made a name for himself in fusion and electronic music by virtue of thoughtful, synth-driven albums like "The First Seven Days." In addition to performing on the first three songs here -- "Star Cycle," "Too Much To Lose" and "You Never Know," Hammer composed the pieces. "Star Cycle" is a somewhat chilly but brilliant tune that reaches its peak with some incendiary guitar and keyboard interplay from Beck and Hammer. "Too Much to Lose" is a more pensive song, with quite a beautiful melody. "You Never Know" ramps up the tension level; this song is vastly underrated, despite its absolutely menacing keyboards and some gripping upper-register guitar.Hammer also is a pretty good drummer, and he takes the percussion chair on "Star Cycle." The impossibly talented Simon Phillips plays drums on "Too Much to Lose" and "You Never Know." My only criticism of these three great songs is that there is no bass player; Hammer does an admirable job of covering the bottom end with bass synths, but even so, there's just not enough low-energy throb here -- the kind of punch that only an electric bass guitar can provide.Enter Mo Foster, who plays bass on the remainder of the record, except for the last song. Foster is rock solid, but also incorporates fusion and funk elements; his playing is tasteful, energetic and fully locked in with what the other musicians are doing. He really nails it on "The Pump," the fourth song here, which would eventually be heard on the "Risky Business" film soundtrack.Also playing on "The Pump" and the remainder of the album: Tony Hymas, who takes over the keyboard chair from Hammer. Hymas is a bit more of a traditional player than Hammer, whose sound is dominated by his bristling synthesizers, whereas Hymas is adept at layered synths but also some rather aggressive piano work.Beck never has been a prolific songwriter. Hymas and Phillips co-wrote the remainder of the songs here, with one exception. As with Hammer, they seem to be operating at the top of their game here. In addition to "The Pump," they offer a rollicking, piano-driven tune called "El Becko," followed by the rather dreamy "The Golden Road."And then the album reaches its high point, in terms of energy: "Space Boogie" is about as over-the-top exuberant as instrumental rock can get. Beck, Foster, Hymas but especially Phillips show no mercy, tenderness or softness here. Phillips drumming is a wonder -- unless my ears deceive me, he's making full use of a double bass drum kit and a rack of tom toms that could supply any three other drummers. It's an awesome performance.The album concludes with "The Final Peace," a mysterious, ethereal tune featuring only Beck and Hymas. The songwriting is credited to the two of them -- and they seem to be reacting to each other's playing at least somewhat spontaneously.I bought this album when it came out in 1980 and have listened to it quite regularly in the ensuing 32 years. I've never tired of it. While I don't think it's Beck's greatest album -- I'd give that title to "Guitar Shop" or (more likely) "Blow by Blow" -- it does hold up very, very well.

"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" is an album EVERY folk-rock fan should have and cherish. This is, in fact, one of the watershed albums of the 1960s; it's almost impossible to overstate its influence and enduring power over the decades.Dylan's first album had seemed a bit stiff, frankly; here, he decides -- instead of being the young, earnest interpreter of folk tradition -- to be himself, and the results are astounding. The album opens with a three-song blast that announced Dylan as THE major artist of the time: "Blowin' in the Wind," "Girl From the North Country" and "Masters of War." "Girl" could've been overshadowed by the other two, except for Dylan's impassioned but restrained vocal delivery and his full-blown, untamed harmonica.Even when being whimsical, Dylan sounded like serious business. In the hands of other artists, songs like "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" and "Bob Dylan's Dream" could have sounded like throwaways. He delivers them in an almost off-handed way, yes, but they still sound charming, witty and NECESSARY, all these decades later.This isn't my favorite Dylan album; the man has recorded so much colossal discs that each listener is going to have his personal favorites, and mine include "Blonde on Blonde" and "Blood on the Tracks." But this album pointed the way not only for Dylan but for countless folkies, rockers and folky rockers in the early 1960s. I cannot imagine how the American scene could have developed without it.

The Otis cleaning system lets you clean from gun breech to barrel on almost any firearm, which is much superior to the barrel-to-breech method necessitated by standard systems equipped with cleaning rods. Otis supplies two cables instead, which allows you to pull a brush or cotton pads the other direction. That way, you're not pulling gunk and fouling into the chamber.This method takes a little getting used to, but after owning the kit for a month or so, I must say two things: All my firearms are shooting better, and I'm enjoying cleaning the guns whereas before it was just a chore to me.Criticism: The small, round case is great for portability -- you can drop this into your range bag quite easily -- but it's a tight, tight fit to get all the brushes etc. in there and get it zipped up. I would've appreciated a slightly roomier case.Otis also makes larger kits with more instruments including scraping tools, but for most gun owners, this kit is more than adequate. I recommend it.

Let's just get right to it: This is an absolutely stunning piece of work, capturing the sound of Jackson Browne at his aching, melancholy/joyful best. The follow-up to this record, "The Pretender," may have been slightly better produced, and it's certainly better played, thanks to the crack session musicians Browne employed -- but "Late for the Sky" just may be his most inspired collection of songs.The opening title track is a glorious piece of pop songcraft, dealing somewhat obliquely with what can only be the end of a relationship. The situation is not spelled out completely, but the sense of impending loss is profound. What exactly is going on here, anyway? Divorce? Death? Very hard to tell -- although the song could be regarded as eerily prescient, given the fact that Browne's first wife, Phyllis, would commit suicide just two years after the album's release.The other material here is equally strong, for the most part, although "Fountain of Sorrow" has always impressed me as being TOO moodily explicit, and "The Road and the Sky" and "Walking Slow" both seem rather slight in comparison with the other songs here.But that leaves us with a literal handful of bona fide masterpieces -- the title track, "Farther On," "The Late Show," "For a Dancer" and "Before the Deluge." Every one of them smites the heart in one way or another. "Farther On" manages to express both fragility and resilience. "The Late Show" -- my God; I don't even know what to say about that one, except that you can practically SEE the protagonist and his troubled (girl?)friend get in that car and drive away to a better life. "For a Dancer" is an absolute elegy, beautiful and emotionally devastating. "Before the Deluge" is often cited as one of the first environmental songs, and it does have that resonance, though again, Browne's refusal to dumb the song down by being too explicit gives it great strength. The "deluge" in question is apparently the deluge of nuclear power plants that went on line in the 1960s and 1970s, but Browne writes the song so universally that it could be about almost anything."Late for the Sky" was one of those watershed albums of the 1970s. It may not have sold as well as Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run," which it predated by a year, or the Eagles' "Hotel California," which was released two years later, in 1976 -- but it was and still is a colossal record from the singer/songwriter era. If you've never heard it, I envy you the glorious pleasure of encountering it for the first time.

"Chicago XIV" is an improvement over its predecessor. For one thing, keyboardist Robert Lamm, by far Chicago's best and most prolific songwriter in the band's glory years, had been in a real slump on the previous two albums. "Upon Arrival," composed with bassist Peter Cetera, wasn't much to write home about, but on his more uptempo contributions, Lamm sounded fired up again. "Manipulation" was good, as was "Thunder and Lightning," cowritten with Cetera and drummer Danny Seraphine.But it was Lamm's "I'd Rather Be Rich" that served as the album's highlight -- it's musically fresh, and the lyrics consitute a scathing indictment of the yuppie lifestyle.Too bad the rest of "XIV" sinks under the weight of Peter Cetera's soft-schlock balladry. Cetera writes or cowrites six of the albums' 10 tracks, including the yawners "Song for You," "Hold On" and "Overnight Cafe."

No way to sugarcoat it: "Chicago 13" is one of the worst albums of the band's career.From the obnoxious overplaying by the horn section to the unusually muddy rhythm parts to the execrable songwriting, "13" seems to be, indeed, a very unlucky album for the band.The album is simply too forgettable and lame for a track by track analysis, but here are the (few) highs and some of the lows:"Street Player," the title track composed by drummer Danny Seraphine and his buddy David "Hawk" Wolinski, keyboard player for Rufus, tries to discofy Chicago's sound with disastrous results. In addition to the Chicago horn section -- trumpeter Lee Loughnane, trombonist James Pankow, reeds player Walt Parazaider -- the late Maynard Ferguson plays on this song -- to no good effect: Just because a trumpeter CAN play in a very high register doesn't necessarily mean it's always a good idea.Thanks to an apparent policy for this album of "everybody in the band gets a publishing credit," we are (mis)treated to "Life Is What It Is," composed by percussionist Laudir de Oliveira with Marcos Valle. It's insufferable.Keyboardist Robert Lamm, once Chicago's finest composer, continues the awful slump he fell into after the death of his friend, guitarist Terry Kath, producing the wretched "Paradise Alley" and "Reruns."Enough, already. I know I said there were some highs here, but I overpromised. Don't waste a nickel on this awful album.

I'll say this much for "Chicago at Carnegie Hall": At least this release from the early 1970s is a real live album, as opposed to what we've been getting since the '80s and into the '90s, "oughts" and 10s. You can call live albums from these later eras "live" if you want, but many of them are notorious for being fixed and/or "sweetened" in the studio by way of overdubs to correct mistakes or, in the worst cases, entire parts added long after the "live" performance took place!Unfortunately, "Chicago at Carnegie Hall" also is an album that falls far short of Chicago's typically high standards. It wasn't that the band could not play live -- I've seen them in concert over the years more than once, and on good nights they're simply terrific: The horns sound rich and powerful, the rhythm section locks in tight, and the guitars and keys typically feature lots of interesting interplay. This has been true even in more recent years as personnel changes have occurred.But Chicago's stand at this famous venue was marred by several things. First, the horn section was definitely off its game that second week of April, 1971. Perhaps they were just tired -- Chicago toured very hard during its first few years -- or perhaps something more ominous was going on: Band members have hinted that producer James William Guercio was roaming around backstage and sometimes ONTO the stage, making critical remarks about bad sound quality and other issues, and generally undermining the entire group's confidence and performance.Maybe that was just sour grapes; the band made those statements years later during the promotional push for "Hot Streets," which they'd released after breaking with Guercio (and after the death of guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath). But one thing is certain: Trombonist Jimmy Pankow was right when he said that Carnegie Hall wasn't designed for amplified music. Essentially, it's a venue built for classical music.So -- whatever the reason -- the sound quality on "Chicago at Carnegie Hall" is quite bad, and it may be that the horn players were overblowing, trying to compensate. But there are a lot of bum notes here, a lot of "clams" that detract from the songs.And the sad thing is that Chicago live could, as I've said, be so good. Personally, I've always preferred "Chicago Live in Japan," the Japanese import the band released in that country after "Chicago V." The sound is better and it's a much crisper, more musical perfomance throughout.Still, parts of "Carnegie Hall" sound great. I've always enjoyed the group's brassy, blaring "A Song for Richard and His Friends" -- an anything-but-subtle attack on the Nixon administration, which was soon to go down in the infamy of Watergate. And Kath sounds great throughout, especially on longer cuts like "South California Purples."Chicago enthusiasts will want a copy of this. More casual listeners interested in a live set from the band should check out "Chicago Live in Japan" instead.

Let's face it: Guitar effects -- whether pedals or rack-mounted -- are insanely overpriced. For that matter, so are most guitars, but that's the world we live in. I say this as the owner of more guitars than I'd like to admit and, at last count, over a dozen pedals and half a dozen rack-mount units.Danelectro's pedals are a refreshing change from this pricy world. True, they're not as good as some of the other choices out there. I have quite a few Boss pedals, and in general they are quieter and sturdier. A couple of them -- including my Boss digital delay and Boss Bluesdriver -- I just can't imagine being without. But I bought Danelectro's Fab Flange knowing I wouldn't use this effect nearly as much. Surprisingly, I find myself kicking it on much more than I thought I would. It's an amazing pedal for the price -- pretty clean sound, easily adjustable.I also bought Danelectro's Fab Chorus, Overdrive and Distortion. The only one I wouldn't recommend is the distortion, which is extremely noisy compared with the other three.On the minus side: I find the connections on the Danelectro pedals pretty annoying. The jacks are on the back of the pedal, while Boss puts them on the sides. But that's a minor complaint. Overall, I'm more than satisfied, given the price I paid.

Beck's "Guero" is a perfect match, really, for the DVD-Audio format -- the almost offhand guitar parts, the spoken-word asides, the joky lyrical bits -- they all bounce around the room in the multichannel mode, underscoring the album's effectiveness.Unfortunately, the songwriting here could have been a bit better. I'm all for the adventurous approach, but there's just a bit TOO much tomfoolery here. The result is an album that doesn't always hang together, though, again, sonically it's hard to argue with Beck's achievements.

As veteran model-makers know, the best way to make a model look realistic instead of toy-like is to bring out the fine details. This Tamiya weathering brush is an excellent tool for that task. I'm on my second one, having foolishly gotten some grit on my first one, which tore it up. DO be careful with it, making sure you keep it clean, and use it ONLY for weathering.I've used this brush primarily on several sub models I've built, including World War II era German and American subs that needed to show some good, honest rust on their paint jobs. Metal boats rust; that's a given. And during wartime, keeping it all scrubbed off and repainted constantly was impossible. Use this brush with a good solution such as Rustall, and you should be very happy with the results. Go slowly and subtly, though! You can always add more, but it's harder to take away.

Mark my words: You may read this positive review I'm writing, decide to buy this album ... and be totally disgusted with it. I am a HUGE Jefferson Airplane fan, but over the decades I've been somewhat careful to recommend this disc. Some people will hate it; that's all there is to it. For this is JA at its most searching, most experimental, and probably hardest-edged.It was the band's third studio album, but the first two records hadn't even hinted at this cacophony of glory, excess and musical thrill-seeking. JA's debut, "Jefferson Airplane Takes Off," basically had been a very straightforward collection of folk-rock songs; there were some winning tunes on that album, including "Come Up the Years" and "Bringing Me Down," with many of the songs written by lead vocalist Marty Balin and rhythm guitarist/backing singer Paul Kantner. Keep in mind, though, that the incendiary Grace Slick wasn't on this album at all; she didn't join the Airplane's front line until the second album, "Surrealistic Pillow," to which she contributed a female vocal presence much stronger than the departing Signe Anderson. Slick also wrote a terrific song for that album, "White Rabbit."Between "Pillow" and "Baxter's," though, dramatic things happened to Jefferson Airplane. For one thing, Marty Balin's dominance of the band he had put together began to wane. Balin was and is a great vocalist but always has been somewhat constrained in his approach to songwriting -- he valued pure folk singing but also could remind a listener of some of the classic crooners. And he wrote primarily love songs.On "After Bathing at Baxter's," though, the other band members were pushing forward as songwriters, especially Kantner, who wrote or cowrote five of the 11 tracks -- and the conventional love song was apparently the last thing on his mind. His tunes -- "Watch Her Ride," "Wild Tyme (H)", "The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil" -- were instead hallucinatory explorations for the band's burgeoning talent, driven into harder and harder territory by Kantner himself along with lead guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Casady, Dryden and Kaukonen also cowrote a forceful nine-minute instrumental called "Spayre Change" (by now you see they'd left their spelling primers at home).It didn't always work -- Spencer Dryden contributed to a sound collage called "A Small Package of Value Will Come to You, Shortly," that featured bodily-function noises and a rather pointless joke as a tagline. And Slick's work here -- the songs "rejoyce" and "Two Heads" -- is good but not truly great; these two pieces just aren't as memorable as they should have been.Meanwhile, poor Marty Balin must have been wondering what had happened to "his" band. He cowrote just one song, with Kantner, the lovely "Young Girl Sunday Blues."And maybe the rest of the band realized they had stretched the rock 'n' form as far as they could for a time. On their next album, "Crown of Creation," they went back to a more conventional song-by-song format, eschewing the segues and much of the studio gimmickry of "Baxter's."If you're an adventurous soul, though, buy this album. If nothing else, it will give you a very good aural picture of how San Francisco rock sounded in 1967, when the Airplane, Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company and other Bay Area bands all were plying their trade. It was a unique time in American music, and one that deserves to be remembered.

I always feel a bit sad when I think how much more popular Bruce Cockburn should be in the United States. He's quite well-known in Canada, and in America he does enjoy an almost cult following, but he's never broken through in this country the way he has in his homeland.So, if you're not familiar with him, don't hesitate -- get this fine compilation album. Cockburn is one of the best songwriters of the last 25 years or so, and he's also an excellent singer and superb guitarist."My Beat," the opening song here, is a beautiful this-is-my-world kind of song, very poignant and observational. "Tokyo," which was written after Cockburn witnessed the aftermath of a rather harrowing car accident in that city, is compact, mysterious and emotionally resonant. "Pacing the Cage" is just absolutely beautiful, with its lovely fretless bass and lyrics that will haunt you long after the song ends.I'm not as big a fan of Cockburn's more political songs, but "If I Had a Rocket Launcher" expresses the kind of righteous indignation I often feel at seeing the machinations of various heavy-handed regimes around the world -- including, at times, the misguided foreign policy of my own nation.Cockburn's work is remarkably consistent; you're hard-pressed to find weak songs on his albums, and this one, being a compilation, cherry-picks some of the best work he's done over the last few decades. Highly recommended.

I am very much a Clive Barker fan, especially of his short stories (The "Books of Blood") and some of the epic fantasy stuff like "Imajica." Less so his movies, though -- I liked the original "Hellraiser" a great deal, and I even have a soft spot (if you'll pardon the phrase) for the flawed but interesting adaptation of "Rawhead Rex."Part of my problem is that "The Midnight Meat Train" was such a great short story. For the film, it had to be stretched out a bit, and that's not a good thing. I found the pacing during the first half of this film a bit leaden. If you're the tolerant sort, though, and you like Barker, stick around for the ending. There are some great, ghoulish images, and the story really picks up. Blu-ray edition is worth getting if you're a Barker completist.

The bulbs burn out frequently. The fixtures themselves tend to stop working altogether after a fairly short time. I have one set that's been in use for two or three years and it's fine, but another set has bit the dust. Not a very durable product.

This SACD import version of the 5.1 surround mix of "Fragile" is, for the most part, very satisfying. The sound quality is great, of course, and the surround mix is, at times, inspired. An example: The bridge of "South Side of the Sky" featuring the piano solo by Rick Wakeman. It opens in the rear speakers, and as it builds, there's a brief drum statement by Bill Bruford that you hear from the front speakers. It's a great moment; throughout its numerous lineup changes, Yes was always blessed with great musicians, and here are two of them, set off perfectly by the multichannel mix. As the song moves back to full band involvement, Wakeman's part shifts quite nicely and subtly to the front of the mix, making room for the surround effect to be applied to the "la la la la la la" vocal part.At other times, the mix can be a bit ham-fisted, especially when it comes to Steve Howe's guitar. There's too much emphasis on fiddling with his various parts. And I also think Bruford and bassist Chris Squire should have been mixed a bit higher -- this great rhythm section ends up sounding a bit sonically flat here and there, especially on what should have been Squire's showcase, "Long Distance Runaround/The Fish."This is one of the few cases, in fact, where I actually prefer the DVD-Audio version to the SACD. Normally, I find the latter format to be warmer, more "ear friendly," whereas DVD-A can be kind of aggressive on the high end. In the case of this release, the DVD-A provides that treble gloss, which highlights Jon Anderson's voice and Howe's electric parts.Either way, though, if you're a Yes fan, this is one of the cornerstone albums to own, and the experience is even more immersive in the 5.1 format. Enjoy!

I may have been irritated at the time, but as the years have passed, "The Complete Studio Recordings" has grown in my estimation, to the point that it's one of the most important box sets in my music collection.Before releasing this, Zeppelin had released a couple of box sets that represented the band's output, but unfortunately changed the running order of the songs -- and, with Zeppelin, the running order was ALWAYS important. No, Zep didn't really do "concept albums" or rock operas a la The Who, but the song sequencing was crucial anyway. Great case in point: Side 3 (to use old vinyl terminology) of "Physical Graffiti," perhaps the band's best album. The running order on that one is "In the Light," "Bron Yr Aur," "Down by the Seaside" and "Ten Years Gone." Maybe it's because I've heard the record so much, but in my mind, there's just no other order for those four songs -- you move from John Paul Jones' eerie keyboards on "Light" to Jimmy Page's solo-guitar "Bron Yr Aur" to the nice shuffle beat of "Down by the Seaside" to the VERY dark and hard-edged "Ten Years Gone."This set preserves the running order of every single Zeppelin studio album, and it's well worth the money to have it that way, not to mention representations of the original artwork of all the albums. No, you don't get the "moveable wheel" cover that graced "Led Zeppelin III," or the window-shade cutouts of "Graffiti," but the set shows you, in exploded views, how those old vinyl covers were constructed. And you get all the cover variations for "In Through the Out Door," which originally came packaged in a plain, grocery-style paper bag to obscure which artwork your particular vinyl copy had.This is a great, great set for the Zeppelin fan, and again, restoring that running order is important. I remember being similarly bummed when "Citizen Steely Dan" came out with every Dan song from the band's history, but with the running order altered somewhat. As with Zep, the Dan's work demands to be heard EXACTLY the way the artist put it together in the first place.

I'm reviewing the films, not the package -- though I did buy this collection because it addresses some aspect-ratio issues that had gone unresolved before.I'll just say this: Stanley Kubrick is, in my opinion, the greatest filmmaker in the history of cinema. Even "Eyes Wide Shut," his last movie, has grown in stature tremendously since I first saw it and felt rather disappointed. That's Kubrick, though -- he's like the poet of filmmaking. You can't read a great poem one time and fully understand it, and it's the same with almost any Kubrick film: You have to see it several times to get it all.

This album is kind of like the buddy who's always there for you, and you finally realize it and say to yourself, "Here's someone I can count on." I love the sound of the record; it's rich without being syrupy or overbearing. Great playing, too, especially the guitars. I don't know wheather it's alt-country or neo-folk or not-so-bluegrass, and I don't care. Labeling music like this is pointless. Just enjoy.

... if it had had a better bonus disc than "Evolutions." What a piece of crap! Basically just an extended commercial. Worst feature: A soppy tribute to "Star Trek: The Experience." Look, I love all things "Trek," but that Vegas show was ... well, it was a VEGAS SHOW; need I say more? Good riddance to it.As for the films: They all look superb. Content-wise, I was more impressed this time with "Generations" and even "Nemesis," convoluted as the plot of the latter is. "Insurrection" -- pretty weak when I first saw it, and my impression hasn't changed. And of course there's "First Contact," the best of the TNG movies, and in fact, IMHO, it ranks with "The Voyage Home" as the two best films of the franchise.Great blu-ray treatment of the TNG movies, but again, I wish this had included a bonus disc as good as the "Captains' Summit" disc that accompanied the release of the TOS films.

"Chicago VII" is not at the top of my list of greatest Chicago albums. In fact, just for the heck of it, here's my ranking of the albums featuring guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath -- after his death, I'm just not interested:1. Chicago Transit Authority I2. Chicago V3. Chicago VII4. Chicago II5. Chicago XI6. Chicago VI7. Chicago VIII8. Chicago III9. Chicago IX (Greatest Hits)10. Chicago At Carnegie Hall (Chicago IV)11. Chicago XThis list is pretty telling. Chicago X was just next to wretched, in my opinion; the songwriting is pretty grim, the songs themselves forgettable. Chicago at Carnegie Hall was poorly recorded, and the band really wasn't at its best. The greatest hits album, Chicago IX, suffered because it featured the severely chopped up radio/singles edits. And Chicago III was atypically strident; "Sing a Mean Tune, Kid," especially, has always grated on my nerves.The rest of the Chicago catalogue in the Terry Kath years always had something good going on, and Chicago VIII is no exception. The lineup:"Anyway You Want": The opener is a Peter Cetera song -- and it's not a sappy ballad! Instead, Cetera offers up a stomper, driven by Robert Lamm's pounding piano. The falsetto vocal sections are kind of ridiculous, but hey, so was a lot of '70s rock."Brand New Love Affair, Parts I and II": Part I is smooth R&B; ear candy, yes, but trombonist Jimmy Pankow's rather shlocky song is redeemed by one of Terry Kath's greatest ever vocals, very soulful and deep. Unfortunately, Cetera takes the more uptempo Part II, and just kind of yammers away at it."Never Been In Love Before": Cetera acquits himself nicely on lead vocals for this mid-tempo song from Lamm."Hideaway": Cetera sings his own composition, going all arena rock on us. Forgettable."Till We Meet Again": An acoustic-guitar-driven song from Kath, somewhat reminiscent of the wistful mood on Kath's "Alma Mater," from Chicago V. Nicely done, but not Terry's best."Harry Truman": Novelty song or not, I've always had a soft spot for Lamm's take on post-Nixon politics. Remember that the country had just barely come out the other side of Watergate, and people were feeling quite cynical. Lamm rightly chose the last president who seemed to care more about integrity than about what the latest polls were saying about him."Oh Thank You, Great Spirit": Kath fuses Native American motifs with a wall of guitars meant to pay homage to Jimi Hendrix. I LOVE this song. There are no horns on it, but I don't see how they would've fit in anyway. With the absence of Pankow's trombone, Walt Parazaider's saxes and Lee Loughnane's trumpet, that reduces Chicago to a five-piece on this selection ... and, actually, they should have played it as a three-piece, featuring only Kath's guitars, Cetera's bass and Danny Seraphine's drums. Robert Lamm's piano and Laudir de Oliveira's congas just get in the way; fortunately, they're both so buried in the mix that they're relatively easy to ignore."Long Time No See": Lamm sings his own slightly funked-up song about losing touch with people. Effective if not truly inspired."Ain't It Blue?" Kath and Cetera trade vocals on this song by Lamm, which comes off as heartfelt and scrappy. Great vocals by both those gents on this number, and Lamm's acoustic piano dips down into the low register in all the right places."Old Days": Pankow's other songwriting contribution to VIII was a big radio hit, but I've never really "gotten" it. Too nostalgic for my tastes, and not having been around for the 1950s, Howdy Doody and such, I can't really relate to it.So VIII is very much a mixed bag, but I still think it's a must-have for Chicago fans. More casual listeners may want to check out some of my other high picks here, perhaps starting with Chicago V, which was accessible and challenging at the same time.

Many fans of Sherlock Holmes grew up reading the annotated version of the stories featuring the famous "consulting detective," courtesy of a learned fellow named William S. Baring-Gould. His day gig was creative director of Time magazine's circulation and corporate education divisions. Most of the rest of the time, apparently, he thought about Sherlock Holmes.Baring-Gould's "The Annotated Sherlock Holmes" was published in 1967, the year he died. I still have it, and have been reading it since acquiring a copy of the two-volume set in the mid-1970s. It was then and is now a wonderful reading experience -- the text of the stories flanked by helpful annotations. Don't know what a dog cart is, for example? Baring-Gould supplied you with an informative -- and often charming and witty -- note about it.But clearly, it was time for an update. Enter "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes," a project overseen by Leslie S. Klinger, a lawyer and writer. Basically, Klinger shows the same respect for the Holmes canon as did Baring-Gould, but offers new annotations and insights gleaned from all the Holmes scholarship that has taken place in the four decades since Baring-Gould died.I refrain from giving it four stars for just one reason: Unlike Baring-Gould's, this two-volume edition contains only the 56 Holmes short stories and NOT the four Holmes novels. Personally, I think the project could have been done without expanding it to a three-volume set, but unfortunately that did not happen. For the novels, you will have to buy Klinger's "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Novels." However, I must also confess that I went ahead and purchased that separate volume. Die-hard Holmes fans will do the same. If you have such a person in your life, getting these three volumes for him or her surely would be considered a marvelous gift.

I did not purchase the "Director's Cut" edition of the Who's "Quadrophenia," despite this album being one of my dozen or so favorite rock albums of all time. Reason: That edition offered only a selection of the songs in 5.1 surround. "Quadrophenia" is the Who's second rock opera and, therefore, OBVIOUSLY one of the most important "concept albums" ever. Hearing only parts of it in surround? Not interested; call me when they do the whole thing.Till then, there's this Japanese import SACD. True, it's stereo only, but it is SACD quality, and the clarity of the mix is quite wonderful. I've listened to it in several different modes including two-channel and the multi-channel setting on my Denon receiver. While not true surround, the latter distributes the stereo image to my left front/surround/surround backs etc.I was quite pleased at the effect I got in that setting. One of the keys of this album is this: Do the sound effects in the mix sound realistic and immsersive? I found this SACD import version to be the best representation ever of "Quadrophenia's" many FX: The crashing waves on "I Am the Sea," the echoing ambiance of the train station on "5:15," the blending of wordless voices, pianos and buzzy synth effects on "The Rock." Even without a "true" surround mix to enjoy, these elements seemed to fill the room and even move around it a bit -- an effect I can only ascribe to particular room acoustics and the fact that no two pair of speakers is ever perfectly matched. As I employed my Denon's Audyssey "wide" settings" to listen to this in multi-channel stereo, I actually had eight pairs of speakers operating -- front L/R, front wide L/R, surround L/R, surround back L/R -- plus the subwoofer and center speaker. Since each pair of speakers displays variances (one might play slightly louder than the other despite your best effort to compensate, one might be more efficient in different ranges), the sense of dynamics in the mix is actually accentuated.Another key element of any "Quadrophenia" mix you can put to the test: Is lead vocalist Roger Daltrey adequately balanced with the band? On the original vinyl release from 1973, Daltrey was too often buried in the mix -- the singer was furious about it, in fact, and lashed out at guitarist Pete Townshend, who had done the producing. Townshend later admitted that Daltrey was right. The first REMASTERED CD mix, however, actually had Daltrey a bit hotter than he should have been.This one gets it EXACTLY right. Daltrey is slightly up front in the room but not too much; you can understand the lyrics (even though I know them by heart by now) and still get the satisfying roar of Townshend's guitar, the rush of his keyboards, and the sweet thunder of John Entwistle's bass and Keith Moon's drums. And Entwistle's brass parts sound full but not shrill.This version cost me much more than I wanted to pay for a stereo-only SACD mix, but I just had a feeling it was going to be worth the bucks. Given that "Quadrophenia" probably has emerged over the years as my favorite Who album, I believe it was money well-spent. This will, I am sure, be my standard version until the band finally releases a complete 5.1 version. One last observation regarding 5.1: I've heard conflicting reports about the possibility of doing this, with some sources saying the other multi-track masters from "Quadrophenia" have gone missing. Other sources say this is nonsense; they're all there. I DO know that it apparently is true that there are missing masters from "Who's Next," which is why we never got a 5.1 mix of that classic. For now, all I can say is this: I await further developments with great interest, and hope any missing tapes from ANY of the Who's albums are returned to them.

There's so much swirling mist and myth and just plain confusion about "Quadrophenia" that it can be difficult to evaluate at this point -- as of this writing, it's 2012, so the Who's second rock opera will turn 40 next year in 2013, hard as that is to believe. In the years since its initial release in 1973, there has been a vinyl stereo edition, a vinyl quadrophonic edition, a theatrical film later released on tape and DVD and most recently Blu-ray, a CD, a remastered CD, a deluxe edition, a "director's cut" edition with some tracks mixed for 5.1, and any number of imports, including one from Japan that presents the work in 2-channel SACD format.For this review, we're sticking with the remastered edition that presents only the original songs in their original lineup -- no extra tracks, no demos, just the opera itself in stereo. And the great thing is that when you just go back and listen to the original, "Quadrophenia" still dazzles. It moves and shakes and rocks and rolls thanks to the high quality of the songs: "I Am the Sea" and its sound effects of crashing waves and the distant shouts of singer Roger Daltrey gives way to "The Real Me," a teen angst anthem if there ever was one. Other standout tracks include "The Punk and the Godfather," "Sea and Sand" and "Bell Boy," all three of which express one of the album's central motifs, that being an ongoing power struggle between the main character, Jimmy, a young "mod" who just wants to party and wear sharp clothes, and "traditional" society, which wants him to settle down, grow up, get a real job and become a good citizen.No, "Quadrophenia" is not as instantly accessible as "Tommy," the Who's previous rock opera about a deaf, mute, blind kid who "sure plays a mean pinball." Nor does it have quite the hugely visceral impact of "Who's Next," the band's 1971 collection of songs that resulted from a failed attempt at yet ANOTHER rock opera that would have been called "Lifehouse."But what "Quadrophenia" does have is a moody, rain/storm/wave driven atmosphere, and simply some of the best songs Who guitarist Pete Townshend ever wrote, including "5:15," "Drowned," "Dr. Jimmy" and "Love, Reign O'er Me."This is, in fact, one of the cornerstone albums by one of the Big Three British Bands that emerged in the early 1960s, those being the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who.I recommend it. Highly. In fact, if I were to be stranded on a desert island with but 10 CDs to listen to forever, this would be one of them.

If I want to listen to a Pink Floyd live performance, I usually go to "Pulse" or the four live tracks the band included on "Ummagumma." However, once in awhile I'll pull "Delicate Sound of Thunder" from the shelf, and I'm always glad I did.Recorded and released in support of the Floyd's "A Momentary Lapse of Reason," this album features some of the better tunes from that just-OK album; guitarist David Gilmour picks out "Learning to Fly," "On the Turning Away" and a few other good songs from that record -- and, in several cases, successfully transforms them into stadium anthems without trashing their melodicism.Well-chosen, too, are the classic tracks. Especially nice: A new version of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond," with a revamped vocal arrangement that compensates quite well for the lead vocals of bassist Roger Waters, who'd left the group after 1983's "The Final Cut." And Gilmour's extended guitar soloing on "Comfortably Numb" and "Run Like Hell" is very energetic.

I dearly wish I had bought the SACD version of "Avalon" when it first came out. I've always liked Roxy Music, but didn't think I was enough of a fan at the time, given other purchases I really wanted to make. Well, hindsight is 20/20, as they say. "Avalon" on SACD has become one of THE most sought-after multichannel mixes out there. Recently, despite the cost of acquiring a copy, I decided to get a used one through the amazon site.My verdict: "Avalon" ties for first place -- with Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" -- as the best rock release in SACD history. Bob Clearmountain's effort to transform "Avalon" from stereo to multichannel has resulted in one of the "must listen" discs for audiophiles.It helps that the music is so incredibly compelling. At the time of the album's original release in 1982, Roxy was at a creative peak, both in terms of songwriting and performance. "More Than This," the opener, is a beautiful little piece of ear candy, but like the rest of the album, listening to it multiple times reveals a depth you might not perceive at first. "The Space Between" isn't my favorite track on the album, but Bryan Ferry's vocals sound especially lush, and the surround mix puts the listener right in the middle of some tasty guitar and percussion parts.Then comes the title track, "Avalon." This is one of the pieces of music that will live in my memory till I die, and it's a song I return to over and over and over again. Part of the appeal is the song's mystery -- it really doesn't seem to have much to do with Arthurian legend, despite the album's cover, which is highly suggestive of the ever-popular English myth. The lyrics evoke a post-party ennui, though, and the music is incredibly seductive. Thematically, the song seems to open up with each verse, becoming less of a declaration than an exploration. "Yes the picture's changing," Ferry sings, "every moment / and your destination / you don't know it." Gee, sounds pretty much like my life, to be honest.Roxy Music never was a band that wanted to hit you over the head with a 2 by 4, and this album is especially subtle. Clearmountain has used the 5.1 mix to emphasize that aspect of the band. On the title track and elsewhere, Andy Mackay's saxophone is mixed in the right rear channel, and when he plays his usually sparse parts, it's like a soft, cool breath on the back of your neck.Some other great stuff here: "Take a Chance With Me" and "To Turn You On," both of which present a persona who hasn't exactly succeeded at relationships and knows it -- yet can't stop himself from trying to charm. Also of note: The instrumental "India," for which the original multi-track tapes could not be found. Clearmountain and Co. solved the problem by panning the song clockwise around the room for the 5.1 mix; since it's the only song for which only a stereo mix was available, it comes off as a great solution."Avalon" was a great capstone to Roxy's career, and we are fortunate indeed that the powers that be chose it for 5.1 presentation. It's kind of the musical equivalent of a fashion model: It's not afraid to be beautiful -- and, in this case, the beauty is far more than skin deep.

John Updike was a titan of 20th-century American literature, and he could do everything, too -- he wrote poetry, children's books, short stories, a play, essays, criticism and, of course, novels.Updike died in 2009 after a half-century career of distinction rarely matched by other writers. He did not win the Nobel Prize, but he garnered many other honors, including two Pulitzer Prizes.His most famous character was Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, a Pennsylvania man readers first met in the 1960 novel "Rabbit, Run." Harry is nicknamed Rabbit because of his speed and grace as a high school basketball star. By the time of this first novel, though, he is slipping into obscurity. Sure, a few people around the fictional towns of Mt. Judge and Brewer remember him, but, at 26, Rabbit is a has-been, working a dead-end job demonstrating an absurd kitchen appliance called the Magi-Peel. He's married to Janice, an alcoholic, and has a son, Nelson, age three. Janice is pregnant with their second child.This is a heartbreaking novel about a young man whose life has soured, who runs out on his responsibilities for a time but finally returns to his family -- with the indication that the only reason he didn't leave for good is a pure lack of imagination. The book is marked by a personal tragedy that will haunt the Angstrom family for generations.And so it goes. Rabbit, who believes in the American dream even as, at times, it seems to be slipping out of his grasp, strives to live a life that is true if not noble. In the second volume, "Rabbit Redux," it is Janice's turn to succumb to restlessness; she leaves him for Charlie Stavros, who works as a salesman for her car-dealer father. "Redux," published in 1971, was set in 1969, and the novel's newsy chatter includes references to the Vietnam War and the first moon landing.Updike won his two Pulitzers for the concluding novels in the series, "Rabbit Is Rich" and "Rabbit at Rest," published in 1981 and 1990, respectively, with the former being set in 1979 and the latter taking place in 1988-89. "Rich" is the only true comedy of this tetralogy. Rabbit is, indeed, rich; his father-in-law has died and Rabbit is now the front man at the car dealership, which has become a Toyota franchise. As the economy sputters and the oil crisis reverberates, Rabbit's little tin cars sell well because of their fuel efficiency, and Rabbit and Janice, who have reconciled, reap the benefits. Still, something isn't right -- at the core of Rabbit's life there lurks a fundamental dissatisfaction that he never can quite chase down. "Rich" is mostly a happy book, but there are dark elements, including Nelson, who is in his early 20s and has become Rabbit's sullen nemesis, blaming his father for what he sees as recklessness and irresponsibility."Rabbit at Rest" finds Rabbit in his mid-50s, retired with Janice and wintering in a Florida condo but returning to Pennsylvania the rest of the year. Nelson has taken over the dealership, but all is not well -- Nelson has developed a nasty drug habit. Rabbit and Janice's intervention into their son's life is, typically for them, messy but well-meaning. Rabbit, though, is far from a well man; he is stricken with a heart attack while trying to teach his granddaughter to sail. As the novel unfolds, the womanizing Rabbit faces one final temptation -- and this time, acting on it could cost him everything."Rabbit Angstrom" is a masterful repackaging, giving the four novels an unprecedented presentation in a single book. Updike tinkered with the texts a bit, correcting some minor mistakes but also restoring some passages that were censored from "Run." He also pens a marvelous introduction reflecting on Rabbit's importance to his writing career.Taken together, these novels constitute one of the great achievements in American literature. If they thrill you the way they did me, be sure and pick up "Licks of Love." It's an Updike short-story collection, but it begins with a novella that serves as a rather wistful postscript to the Rabbit series.

I know they're "dead" audio formats, or basically are, but I remain attached to DVD-Audio and SACD. Until I'm convinced I've heard something better, these are the best two audio formats ever created -- and the Who's "Tommy" a great vehicle for both.Of the two versions, I actually prefer the SACD, which is a little warmer compared to the somewhat glassy sound of the DVD-A. But the DVD-A also offers some visual content that's worth one's time, including photos of the band from the original recording session. Better still, a couple interviews with Who guitarist/keyboardist/songwriter Pete Townshend, who recalls the recording of the original album and also gives us information on mixing and mastering the album for the new surround formats. One reason he chose to start with "Tommy" is that it was recorded in the studio using only eight tracks. That meant fewer decisions involved to get the final 5.1 product.Either version is going to please Who fans. The audio purist probably will prefer the SACD, while the completist should pick up the DVD-A. Or be greedy like me and get both. I usually don't do that but ...... this album was pretty important to me, growing up. I didn't get to hear it when the band released it; I was only 8 years old and I wasn't tuned into such things just yet. But in my early teens, the Who pretty much walked me through a typically troubled adolescence. Roger Daltrey has said on occasion that the band probably saved him from some bad stuff, including a propensity to violence. I'm sure I could say the same thing -- the Who always have been rock's thinking (and yes, guitar- and hotel-smashing) band. Townshend's songs, along with the smaller number contributed over the years by bassist John Entwistle, gave me outlets for youthful anger but also reminded me there were things in this world -- and beyond -- far more sublime.

There are several options out there for modelers who want a version of the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane, which still holds the speed record for fastest air-breathing aircraft ever made (the X-15 flew at much greater velocity but it was rocket-powered). In addition to this 1/72 scale model, Revell also has released a 1/110 version, and Testors' 1/48 version has gotten some fairly positive reviews. By far, though, this 1/72 kit from Revell has gotten the most attention from the modeling community.The bottom line: With careful attention to detail and some basic problem-solving skills, an experienced modeler can produce a very fine end result. But there is one especially infamous issue to deal with: The upper and lower halves of the fuselage/wing do NOT fit well at all. If you simply glue them together -- and you will need clamps or modeling tape to get them to stick, plus the patience to let the two halves dry for several hours or overnight -- your are left with some significant seams all around the underside of the model.I had to resort to a bottle of Mr. Surfacer 500 to get my model to look acceptable to me. I filled the seam all the way around, using Mr. Surfacer and a medium paintbrush to apply the stuff. Warning: Do this with good ventilation; Mr. Surfacer is an EXCELLENT but SMELLY product. After letting the Mr. Surfacer dry, I started sanding. And sanding. And sanding...I've heard of other modelers using acetone to smooth the seams after using Mr. Surfacer, but I've never used acetone and was leery of ruining my model. So I sanded ... and sanded ... and sanded ... Finally, I had a pretty good surface. Not perfect, but much better than if I'd used no filler at all.The other big time-eaters for me on this model were the paint and decals. I confess I don't always use primer on my models but I strongly recommend it with this kit, just because the upper surfaces in particular have those deep ridges. Your paint will adhere much better if you prime this beast first. I also ended up mixing my own custom color. Despite their name, the Blackbirds were NOT black but rather a very dark or "midnight" blue. Check out some Web sites showing the Blackbirds parked on runways in full sunlight and you'll see what I mean.Ah, the decals: They're a challenge here, especially the red stripes that adorn the wing areas. Just be patient and gently position them until you match up with the guide provided. Also, I strongly recommend using Micro Set and/or Micro Sol or similar decal-setting solutions, which will help give that "painted-on" look ... very important here because of the ridged surfaces. Finally, don't forget to coat the whole finished project with some Testors Dullcote or Model Masters Lusterless Lacquer, which can be used safely over Testors and Model Masters enamels or acrylics. A clear coating makes sure the decals stay fixed in place.I really, really enjoyed building this plane and, again, think Revell has done a pretty great job with this kit overall. I did have one issue with the paint guide provided -- mine was pretty vague as to which color went where. Fortunately, I contacted Revell and they e-mailed me a PDF guide that was more explicit.Final thought: This is a fun kit for anyone with some model-building experience but I would NOT recommend it for a child or a neophyte.

I'll get right to it: There is probably no mainstream model kit company these days that is doing as fine a job with large sub models as Revell of Germany. This model of the USS Gato class of World War II submarine is gigantic -- you're going to need four feet of linear shelf space for this one if you decide to build it!The Gato is even longer than Revell of Germany's 1/72 kit of the German Type VIIC U-boat, which is as it should be -- in "real life," the Gato class subs were over 300 feet long while the VIICs ran 220 feet.So long is the Gato model, in fact, that the hull halves would not have fit in the box had Revell of Germany not decided to construct the kit so that you have to attach the bow and stern, each of which is also in two sections. I personally wish they had molded each hull half as a single piece instead of three, but that would have required even larger packaging.As I noted in my review of the 1/72 VIIC, you will need modeler's tape and patience to get the hull together. The instructions for this kit call for you to glue and use tape to keep the hull together as the glue dries. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS and let your cement set for AT LEAST six hours, preferably overnight, before carefully removing the tape.Overall, though, the fit of the parts in this kit is quite good.Decals and painting: Decals are pretty minimal and should pose NO problem for modelers experienced with working with waterslide decals. Painting scheme for the Gato class is pretty simple -- there are variations here, but basically the hull has sections of black and a couple of shades of gray, and the decking on these kits should be black or a VERY dark grey.I very much enjoy knocking out smaller-scale subs, such as the Russian and American nuclear subs in Hobby Boss's 1/700th series. But now and then it's nice to take on a bigger challenge. The Gato class 1/72 scale sub is a big task, but it's quite doable as long as you go slowly and pay attention to detail. Enjoy! And on a final note: Amazon's price on this one is just about unbeatable.

MRC -- Model Rectifier Corporation -- probably isn't taken very seriously by skilled model-makers, but then again, those folks aren't the target audience. The company's "easy models" are indeed easy; with the subs, the only thing you have to do is get the model out of the box and place it on the accompanying stand.But the models generally are well done, and I have bought a couple to "fill in" with my "regular" sub fleet of models that you have to assemble and paint. I wasn't that interested in building a Los Angeles class sub, but I wanted one in the 1/700 scale to compare with my 1/700 Hobby Boss Russian Typhoon.Speaking of Hobby Boss: Both Hobby Boss and MRC have been releasing quite a few subs in the 1/700 class -- and the bases supplied with the models, whether the prebuilt MRCs or the must-assemble-and-paint Hobby boss kits, are virtually identical. Are these two companies owned by the same parent? I'm not sure, but I like mixing and matching the two.I generally like to work in larger scales; I have other sub models in 1/350, 1/300, 1/180, 1/144 and 1/72 -- real monsters in that last category, with one being about four feet long! But these smaller subs provide a nice balance ... and MRC definitely is the way to go if you're interested in underwater boats but really don't have much time to devote to model-making as a hobby.

Actually, my title is sarcastic: This IS Neil Young's first solo album, from 1968. And it's not bad at all; it's just that this album sounds very restrained compared with the music Young would go on to make soon after it.There are some real gems here, including "Here We Are in the Years" and the striking but oddball "The Old Laughing Lady." Other songs, though, including the instrumental "String Quartet From Whiskey Boot Hill" are simply forgettable. To his immense credit, Young closes out the album with "The Last Trip to Tulsa," a nine-minute-plus guitar-and-voice exploration that's as head-scratchingly good as some of Dylan's mid- to late-Sixties work, to which it seems to pay at least a bit of homage.It took only one more album for Young to start making legendary music: "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere," the first album which benefited from the presence of backing band Crazy Horse, is just phenomenal. It's not that the songwriting is better; Young has been a great tunesmith since his days with Buffalo Springfield. But the delivery of these pieces, from the concise "Cinnamon Girl" to stretched workouts such as "Down by the River" and "Cowgirl in the Sand," is nothing less than awe-inspiring.From there, Young moved on to "After the Gold Rush" on his own and the period where he first became the Y in CSNY. His contributions to the group's 1970 album, "Deja Vu," are among the best on that album, and indeed "Helpless" is one of the great songs of Young's entire career.So yes, go ahead and buy this first album. Just be aware that "Neil Young" is not the best record he's ever made. All that said, it's well worth hearing.

This narrow tape is perfect for applications in which standard widths of masking tape would be way too much. I've used it on 1/700th-scale submarine models to paint waterline striping, for example.One thing to note: The modeler must be careful to make sure the tape is firmly stuck to the surface -- because the tape is so narrow, it doesn't have much adhesive capability. Make sure you use a cotton swab to gently press the tape right before you're going to commence painting.

Maybe it was mid-1970s ennui that caused it, or maybe some sort of collective musical midlife crisis the band was having, but the fact is that during that time period, the members of Yes decided a break was needed, during which each of the five members would record and release a solo album.The albums were: Singer Jon Anderson's "Olias of Sunhillow," guitarist Steve Howe's "Beginnings," keyboardist Patrick Moraz's "Story of I," Chris Squire's "Fish Out of Water" and drummer Alan White's "Ramshackled."It was a mixed bag, indeed. Anderson's "Olias" was actually quite good, albeit very strange -- there were the layers of vocals one might expect from him, but also an impressive array of instrumental sounds, as on the largely instrumental "Moon Ra/Chords/Song of Search." Moraz's "Story of I" was his first solo album, and he would not be a member of Yes for very long (Rick Wakeman soon returned to the fold, meaning that Moraz's only appearance on a Yes album was "Relayer"), but the album has stood the test of time, with some listeners proclaiming it as one of the strongest of Moraz's career.White and Howe didn't fare as well. White's "Ramshackled" was basically a collection of friends playing gritty, soul-influenced ballads. It was pretty good stuff, and White got a chance to play in a different style than Yes demanded of him, but the record came off sounding slight. As for Howe's "Beginnings": It was absolutely the worst of the lot. Despite Howe's considerable instrumental talents, the composing here was banal, the vocal delivery stilted, and even the playing, always Steve's strength, often degenerated into pointless noodling.Then we have Squire's "Fish Out of Water," by far the best of the five albums. "Hold Out Your Hand," "You By My Side" and "Lucky Seven" were all catchy, rhythmically inventive rock songs, driven by Squire's always-delightful bass playing and his strong voice -- in those years in Yes, Squire was Anderson's chief backup man, although Howe contributed backing vocals, too. Those three songs all clocked in at under seven minutes. The remaining two, "Silently Falling" and "Safe (Canon Song)" both stretched out, with the former running more than 11 minutes and the latter coming in at nearly fifteen! Yet Squire doesn't allow these longer, suite-styled songs to become boring. OK, so maybe "Safe" could have used some judicious editing, perhaps removing two or three minutes, but overall, these were very much like the longer songs you'd find on a Yes record -- complex but tuneful and engaging.Squire also hired ex-Yes drummer Bill Bruford to play on the disc, which was a good decision. Not that I don't like Alan White, but Bruford's more angular, leaner style was perfectly suited to what Squire was trying to do on this record."Fish Out of Water" sold quite well, though not nearly as well as anything in the Yes canon. For the dedicated Yes fan, it's essential -- and even the more casual listener will find much to like.

I owned a copy of this from the time I was in my teens until I was in my forties (talk about time fading away!), then foolishly let the album go along with a lot of others after getting sick of how much room my vinyl collection took up. And of course, after some months went by, found myself missing this one terribly.Yes, some of the backing vocals are out of tune, and yes, there are some ragged performances here, but as with Young's other two "Ditch Trilogy" albums, those elements are part of the point -- when Young is raw, he still can be a very affecting musician and singer. Besides, some of the songs just ROCK -- the title track, "Don't Be Denied" and "Last Dance" are great rave-ups. The softer tunes include "Love in Mind" and "The Bridge," both of them very moving.Young has released strong live albums since this one, but the special appeal of "Time Fades Away" is that it was a set of live songs that had NOT been released in studio-recordings form. And this album preceded Jackson Browne's "Running on Empty," which took a similar approach, by several years.I know it's Neil Young's business not to release this on CD, but like many other folks, I wish he would. It's unique in his catalog, as far as I know -- I even have "Journey Through the Past," his film soundtrack, on CD, having bought it as a Japanese import. It wouldn't be that difficult to do, despite the mythology that has grown up around the album. Yes, it's true there was never any stereo master made, but it's NOT TRUE that the album was recorded directly into a computer. The "CompuMix" was a digital mixing soundboard, not a computer. It was a mess, but the truth is that there are original multi-track tapes, which means the album could be remixed and then mastered. Young just doesn't seem to want to do it.

"Being There" is a brilliant, brilliant film that gets better every time I view it. I can't say that about the vast majority of movies I see, obviously. Peter Sellers is diabolically good as Chance the gardener, a sheltered nitwit who has spent his entire life in a townhouse, working for an old and presumably once-wealthy man. Upon the man's death, Chance is cast out into the world.A truly chance encounter then occurs; he is hit by the chauffeur-driven car of a wealthy couple living in the Washington, D.C., area. Just as he's telling the wife his name, he begins coughing because of the alcohol she's served him, and when he says "Chance the gardener," what she hears is "Chauncey Gardener." She -- Eve Rand -- takes him home to be cared for by a medical team in the employ of her husband, multimillionaire Ben Rand, who , considerably older than she, is dying.What ensues is a run-on case of mistaken identity. Chance is just a gardener, but his homespun sayings are taken as wise philosophy by those who insist on seeing meaning and metaphor in everything. Chance is only a gardener, yes, but in the wishful minds of those he meets, he is the mysterious Chauncey Gardener, man of few -- but sage! -- words. Chance really is talking about gardening, but Chauncey becomes a Candide to those who think his voice is the very sound of enlightenment. We must cultivate our garden, indeed!"Being There" is a black comedy. Whether you find it funny, along with disturbing, depends in great part on your world view. If you do not suffer fools gladly but enjoy seeing them, now and then, in your books and movies, this flick's for you. If you find it hard to believe that a blithering idiot can't possibly be mistaken for a genius, you need to watch something else -- and, I would submit, pay more attention to the real world around you, in which this sort of thing happens all the time, especially in politics.This is a tremendous film. Five stars all the way; I'd give it six if they'd let me.

"Into the Music" is just that -- a headlong dive into gospel, blues, soul, jazz, rock and more. It effortlessly fuses many of the styles Van Morrison loves, and never seems awkward or hokey or forced.I still find it useful to think of albums released back in the vinyl age in two parts -- because that's how the artists back then conceived them, and how the audience expected to hear them. Albums released in the CD age did change; rarely has an artist felt the need, in the format that debuted in the 1980s, to think of the music in terms of two moods. But "Into the Music" was released in 1979, a few years before the advent of the CD, so I'm going to treat it as such.In its vinyl configuration, "Into the Music" displayed two distinct musical flows. Side one consisted of six shorter songs, while side two offered four longer ones -- and the final two cuts on the second side really played as one (more on that soon).The first side was also lighter in mood. "Bright Side of the Road," "Full Force Gale" and "Steppin' Out Queen," especially -- the first three numbers -- were uptempo in beat and absolutely rapturous in terms of delivery. Van sang his heart out on all three, then slowed things down a little with "Troubadours." "Rolling Hills," which featured Van in what I call his "rough/gruff/tender" voice, was next, and the side closed with a joyous reading of "You Make Me Feel So Free."That side of this classic album was terrific. But side two was STUNNING. Here were four of the best pieces of music Morrison ever had recorded, delivered with such passion and conviction that it was truly awesome.With its lilting opening, you expected "Angeliou" to be of a piece with the six cuts from side one, but it became apparent very quickly that Morrison was swimming in deeper waters. This is a powerful love song, nearly seven minutes long, driven by Morrison's searching, soaring, swooping voice. "In the month of May / In the city of Paris" he repeats over and over as the song unfolds, turning two simple phrases into incantations of desire. Behind his voice, his band just keeps winding the song tighter and tighter. It's a brilliant performance.Great as it is, what follows is even more jaw-dropping: "And the Healing Has Begun" has Morrison wooing a woman even as he seems to find a healing power within himself. Along the way, he calls upon the healing spirits of blues gods such as Muddy Waters, and even finds humor in the whole musical, erotic, spiritual enterprise, singing, at one point, "I can't stand myself!" It's a song, and a performance, for the ages.The final two numbers are really one, because "It's All in the Game" segues directly into "You Know What They're Writing About," as Morrison fuses a cover of the old Dawes/Sigman composition with one of his own, resulting in a 10-minute, 49-second manifesto that seems to express every theme the album has touched upon -- love both erotic and spiritual, friendship, the power of music, the power of memory, the sheer, unexplainable power of being alive and human and in touch with the good (but not perfect) soul that God in his grace has given you.I have recommended many books, movies and albums on Amazon. I've seen fit to bestow five stars on many of those picks. But hear me now: "Into the Music" isn't just about recommendations or star ratings. This is one of the few works of art I've ever experienced that have touched me so deeply, there have been times I could think of little else. Get this record. Let it change your life. Then cherish it across the decades, knowing that the healing has only begun.

I give "Common One" four stars instead of five because of the presence of one song that has remained, over the decades, simply too bizarre for me to understand why Van Morrison included it on an otherwise brilliant record.That song is the closer, the 15-minute "When Heart Is Open," a free-flowing, whispery meditation with sparse instrumentation. All that I could take, but what I CANNOT abide is Morrison's so-called harmonica playing on this song. I know, I know; he's trying a kind of "scat" harp sound here, playing the instrument and vocalizing through it at the same time. Yes, I KNOW what he's trying to do ... and I just hate it.Fortunately, the other five songs on "Common One" are so amazing that the disc remains fairly high on my Morrison playlist. It certainly isn't his best disc ever; there are half a dozen others I would rate higher. But those five songs are magnificent:"Haunts of Ancient Peace": It still gives me the shivers, with its ghostly instrumental arrangement and Morrison's searching, beautiful vocal. Slow tempo; absolutely gorgeous horn arrangement."Summertime in England": The OTHER 15-minute song on the album, instead of barely dragging itself along, crackles with energy, thanks largely to the rhythm section of drummer Peter Van Hooke and bassist David Hayes, who simply play the hell out of this heavenly epic."Satisfied": The horn section shines again, this time on an uptempo number that sounds like a fusion of jazz and gospel; trumpeter Mark Isham and saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis trade some very tasty phrases near the song's explosive coda."Wild Honey": The entire band is in fine form on this piece, and Morrison's lead vocal is disciplined but very expressive. He sounds more like a crooner here than a blues/jazz shouter, but that approach fits the song perfectly."Spirit": To this day, I don't know why Morrison didn't just end the album with this track. He STILL would've ended up with 40 minutes of music (instead of the 55 with the inclusion of "When Heart Is Open"). As for sequencing, Side One of the old vinyl format could have been just "Haunts of Ancient Peace" and "Summertime in England," and that side would have been a more than adequate 22 minutes 52 seconds. Morrison then could have put "Satisfied" on Side Two with "Wild Honey" and "Spirit," and would've had a second side with a playing time of 17 minutes 5 seconds -- respectable enough.And had he left off the meandering, ultimately pointless "When Heart Is Open," I think "Common One" as a whole would've been and would've remained one of the most highly regarded albums of his career.But Van is the Man partly because he does exactly what he wants to do. That may frustrate us fans sometimes, but I cannot help continuing to admire his integrity and singular vision.

There are several reasons the DVD-Audio version of "Chicago V" is out of print and commanding high prices from re-sellers: It contains some of the best music Chicago ever made, and the surround mix presents that music to great effect.As others have noted, "V" was the first single-disc album of Chicago's career. The first three albums were doubles, and "Chicago at Carnegie Hall," the fourth, was a monstrous four-disc set (we're using vinyl terminology here, but back in the early 1970s, that was really the only terminology there was, unless you were gullible enough to buy 8-tracks). Band members themselves have said the demands of producing double albums eventually sapped their songwriting. And yet, at least in the case of one band member, that doesn't appear to be true on "Chicago V." Of the ten tracks here, if you count the two parts of "Dialogue" separately, eight of them were written by keyboardist Robert Lamm, and the songs sound anything but tired.The disc begins with "A Hit by Varese," with Lamm lamenting the apparent inability for pop music to open its ears to experimentalism even as it expresses the hope that a composer as relatively obscure and difficult as Edgard Varese could have a hit single. The song's challenging beat and Terry Kath's grinding guitars backed up Lamm's utopic lyrical sentiments with a hard-edged musical stance.Lamm's "All Is Well" sounded much more conventional and poppy, but a careful listen to the lyrics reveals a persona trying to talk himself into believing that everything's going to be all right. It was followed by "Now That You've Gone," the album's sole composition by James Pankow. With its juicy horn arrangement, it was probably the most "Chicago-sounding" track on side one. Lamm closed out the side with the two part "Dialogue," sung by Kath and bassist Peter Cetera. Musically pleasing, it was also lyrically stimulating, with the dialogue basically being an argument between staying engaged with politics and culture vs. sticking one's head into the sand. Obviously, that message remains relevant to this day.Side two began with Lamm's ominous "While the City Sleeps," which asserts that shadowy men are finding new ways to "tell us dirty lies." Again, a song that seems to have resonance now, despite having been recorded nearly four decades ago. It was followed by "Saturday in the Park," the album's huge hit single; penned by Lamm, the song certainly is a pleasant piece of ear candy, yet it wasn't mere fluff, being, rather, an affectionate take on being alive and plugged into New York City's Central Park -- its music and communal sensibility at the time the song was written.Lamm's "State of the Union" railed against the hypocrisies wrought by tight-assed society and authoritarianism, while "Goodbye" was a fairly standard but still haunting love song.The album ended with Kath's brilliant "Alma Mater," an absolutely lovely but somewhat stark track -- Chicago's horn section does play on it, but only briefly and toward the end. Meanwhile, Kath sings of the joys of success, of "living in that dream" of stardom, which many achieve but few handle truly well. "We must set brand-new goals," Kath sings. "We must not lose control." Sadly, Kath did just that over the next few years; numerous sources have cited his drug and alcohol abuse, and in January 1978 he pointed a gun at his own head and pulled the trigger. It was not suicide -- Kath believed the gun was not loaded -- but it was a bizarre and needless death nonetheless.The 5.1 mix here isn't fancy. Generally, with multichannel mixes, the idea is to separate the instruments and vocals as much as possible to achieve better sonic clarity. That does happen here, but the production and engineering on this mix also wisely preserves the cohesiveness of the Chicago sound. The band's horns, as well as the voices of Kath, Lamm and Cetera with help from trumpeter Lee Loughnane, were always meant to sound as units. That sensibility has been preserved here, even as the aural space has been opened up."Chicago V" is one of the band's very best efforts, and the DVD-Audio version is nothing less than spectacular. If you're a multichannel fan, don't hesitate -- pay that extra cash and have a listen.

"The Witches of Eastwick" is one of John Updike's better novels, partly because of its rich sense of humor and even surer sense of place.The setting is a fictional Rhode Island town, Eastwick, and the witches of the title are three women whose sexual morals and (perhaps) abilities to work magic and cast spells do not play well with the other townspeople, especially the women.In addition to the three women, we also encounter a fourth, male character who just may be the Old Scratch himself. All three of the witches end up getting involved with him -- and discover that they truly are playing with fire."Eastwick" succeeds as a novel for many reasons, not least of which is its understanding of small-town politics and mores. This is an area Updike knew well, having been born in semi-rural Pennsylvania but having lived most of his adult life in New England suburbia. This novel rings true when it describes the sometimes judgmental nature of that world. If you've ever lived in that realm, you don't have to be a witch -- or the devil himself -- to be made to feel like an outcast.If you like this novel, don't miss "The Widows of Eastwick," which Updike wrote very late in his career -- that book was published, in fact, just a few months before his death. Also, the film version of "The Witches of Eastwick" isn't really BAD, per se -- among its better attributes are good performances by Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Jack Nicholson -- but it certainly doesn't carry the weight of its source material. Watch it with an open mind, and be sure to enjoy the humor, which the filmmakers played up quite a bit.

This is just an excellent kit version of the Gato class, one of the most prominent and numerous of the U.S. submarines utilized in World War II. The scale is truly impressive -- 1/72 scale of a 311-foot-8-inch boat means a model that is 52 inches long, or 4 feet 4 inches. Fortunately, my office/AV room has a nice wooden ledge that runs along two of the four walls, so that's where this baby resides.If I have a "druther," it's that I wish the manufacturer had molded the hull in two pieces instead of six. That is, two 52-inch hull halves instead of two hull halves plus two halves for the glue-on bow and two halves for the glue on stern. NOT doing this, however, allowed the company to package the Gato in the same size box used for the German U-Boot Type VIIC, which is about 39 inches long.Note, too, that both Revell and Revell of Germany apparently have released versions of this sub in this scale. The Revell of Germany kit has MUCH better instructions with it, especially the very detailed paint guide, whereas the U.S. Revell version offers an extremely basic and, in my opinion, misleading paint guide. If you can get the German version, great; if not, you can download the German instructions (they include English, too, so no worries) from Revell's Web site.

It's a little thin on story, but the characters are so charming and the visuals so dazzling that it's hard to knock this movie. PLUS ... it holds my nephew's attention every time we watch it together, and that's saying something. Now if only I could stop him from saying the lines out loud; he's memorized the whole thing.I grew up in an era in which cartoons were pure fun ... Looney Tunes stuff, that kind of thing. Lots of modern animation doesn't grab me. This film did.

Warning: Don't buy this if you're into traditional fishing shows. This isn't what you what. This is pure comic genius, yes, and very oddball, yes, but it's not Harold Ensley. John Lurie is an inspired nutcase, taking the likes of Tom Waits and the late Dennis Hopper fishing in strange locales. Waits gets angry at one point. Hopper ... well, he spends his time being Dennis Hopper. I missed this show when it was on (briefly). Thanks to the Criterion Collection for preserving it.

I know some people have criticized the price of this set, though now that it's out of print, it seems that reasonable copies are out there for the taking. Other reviewers have stated that the mono mixes don't add much. With all due respect: Nonsense! Some of the stuff on "Surrealistic Pillow" especially sounds COMPLETELY different when you hear it in mono instead of stereo.In fact, I will say that the mono mixes probably outshine the stereo mixes for "Jefferson Airplane Takes Off," the band's first album. That shouldn't come as a great surprise, since this material was recorded nearly 50 years ago now, smack-dab in the middle of the 1960s; at the time, mono was still quite common, though stereo was making significant inroads. Engineers were much more used to it, and much more proficient at producing good, balanced mixes.As for "Surrealistic Pillow," the second album, the mono/stereo thing is a matter of opinion. I enjoy both, so I appreciate the fact that this set provided a choice.How things had changed by 1967, when the Airplane released "After Bathing at Baxters." I cannot imagine this album WITHOUT a stereo mix, which by this time had become almost a studio instrument unto itself. The Airplane takes full advantage of the new sonic atmosphere, shifting sounds from speaker and speaker and, in general, creating a more immersing or ambient experience. Of course, the musical style had changed dramatically, too; "Baxter's" was full-on acid rock, whereas its predecessor, "Pillow," was yet steeped very deeply in traditional folk.And so there is no mono mix here of "Baxter's," nor of its follow-up "Crown of Creation," one of the Airplane's most powerful and rather sadly overlooked efforts. Grace Slick in particular is in excellent voice here, and her songwriting contributions are crucial, including the reflective, age-self-conscious "Lather."I do agree with the critics who've wondered why this set did not include the Airplane's fifth studio album, "Volunteers." That was the last album before vocalist and founder Marty Balin left the band, so it would have seemed a natural break point. Besides, after Balin left, the Airplane was never the same -- both "Bark" and "Long John Silver" were mediocre compared with what the band had achieved.Still, this is a great set, and a must for anyone who loves the Airplane or is curious about the direction of popular music in the 1960s.

I waited a long time to write this review -- several months, in fact. Funny, but as much of a fan as I am of Robert Fripp, I somehow missed this album upon its initial release in 2007. Not until this February, 2012, did I hear it. And in fact, on first listen, I had to turn it off -- I found it so emotionally jarring, so anxiety-producing, that I simply couldn't take it.Of course, I was driving through a rainstorm at the time that was threatening to turn to ice, and I was not physically very well, and I was on some medication that, shall we say, had somewhat altered my usual state of mind. But the main thing that unsettled me was simply the deep, resonant, booming/humming notes of Fripp's guitar as it came rumbling up out of the mix following the initial, beautiful tumbling of the bell-like tones that Fripp had chosen to begin with. Alas, I have ended that sentence with a preposition, but the spirit of the paragraph is accurate, and so must be left as it is.After calming down a bit -- it helped that the rain relented somewhat, and I was feeling confident I could reach my destination that night -- I put the disc back in the CD player and tried again. This time, I made it all the way through the CD, but still had to pull over at one point...because I was in tears and could not see the road. Mark me: Fripp does not always produce such an emotional response in me. I love his Soundscapes albums and Frippertronics, and I'm a diehard King Crimson fan, but most often, what I experience in those settings is an appreciation for the technical brilliance of the music. Here, instead, I was overwhelmed by the fusion of joy and melancholy that's apparent in every note Mr. Fripp plays.So intense was my experience with this record that it started me wondering about Fripp's religious views. I was always of the opinion that he probably didn't have any, or had very little. Now, I'm not so sure -- he was clearly inspired by these beautiful churches. Of course, that simply could be the inspiration of architecture on a grand scale.Whatever the source of his inspiration, Fripp sounds very reverent of SOMETHING in these instrumental pieces. All the works here have a powerful, astonishing solemnity about them, and a beauty that is truly, truly otherworldly.In short, this is one of the greatest albums I've heard in the last decade of my life. I actually feel privileged to have discovered it and to have enjoyed it so much ... and dearly hope to listen to it many more times before my own time comes to an end.

"Money Never Sleeps" could have been fantastic. And the timing was perfect for director Oliver Stone to explore the changes that had occurred on Wall Street since the 1980s. Alas, the critics are right on this one. The financial meltdown of 2008 provides a great backdrop, but Stone manages to squander most of his opportunity.How? The main culprit is the weak script. All the Wall Street stuff crackles with energy, but the situation involving Winnie, Gordon Gekko's daughter, and her fiance and father just doesn't add up to much. Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, and really tries to sell the idea of Gekko as a man torn by his old lust for power and greed and his need to reconcile with the one family member he has left -- but I just didn't buy it, and that's the fault of the screenwriting, not the actor. Douglas exudes charm as always, and the scenes involving him getting out of prison are at once humorous and heartbreaking, but the film quickly loses steam.But there are mediocre performances, too. Shia Labeouf has all the tools he needs to make his character -- Winnie's fiance Jacob Moore -- a fascinating study, but for reasons I can't quite articulate, he doesn't quite pull it off. What is it with this young chap? He was truly marvelous in "The Greatest Game Ever Played," but since then seems to have made a career of being underwhelming in some very big movies -- the fourth "Indiana Jones," the "Transformers" series, and this. As for Carey Mulligan: She pulls out all the stops (and the tears) in her performance as Winnie, yet ultimately I found it very difficult to care about her.I still give the Blu-ray release three stars, though, because of the extras, which actually eclipse the movie in terms of quality. There's a lot of material here about the way Wall Street works "then and now," and also a really fine little history of that area of Manhattan that was more gripping than just about anything else on the disc. Too bad the feature itself falls short -- but I got it used, and all in all I think I made a wise investment. ;)

I can't say how much I paid for it, since Amazon will just delete it, but rest assured that this collection is well worth the cost. In fact, it's very generous, considering that there are EIGHTEEN CDs here.Those 18 are organized into nine 2-disc sets, each of which explores an aspect of the blues. Some volumes are dedicated to instruments; you'll find a double-disc blues guitar excursion, and also two twofers for piano and harmonica. Other sets pursue a specific theme, such as women in the blues and Chicago blues.One of the strengths of this collection is that it's not limited to drawing on the back catalog of a single label, such as "Atlantic Jazz." In its original vinyl configuration, that boxed set featured four double albums. But since the project was designed from the get-go to present only artists who had recorded for Atlantic, the selection was somewhat narrow, and some of the better-known musicians and groups appeared more than once. That's not a problem here; "Essential Shoebox" is a broad survey of bluesmen and women.Anthologies such as this work only when the producers can make them appeal to a wide audience. "Essential Shoebox" rates a thumbs-up in that department as well; the collection serves as an excellent primer for novices who want to get to know the blues, but also proves satisfying for blues aficionados. In short, it's a great way to get into the music or to get BACK into the music. I can't imagine there's a blues fan out there who won't find something to like here.

I saw "Avatar" in IMAX 3D the day it was released. I must say that, for three hours, I was absolutely entertained and thoroughly engaged with the movie. I saw it with a good friend, and afterward, we both found many things about the movie that we admired.We also found, as several days and then weeks went by, that the movie simply faded away. In other words, it just did not provoke any more discussion, or indeed make any sort of real, lasting impression on us. I give "Avatar" three stars for its storytelling drive and its special effects, but can't go any higher than that because, ultimately, the movie is emotionally shallow and extremely pedantic.It isn't as if James Cameron isn't capable of making movies with heart. "The Abyss" depended on a lot of special effects, too, but the scene involving the Deepcore crew trying to resuscitate Mary Elizabeth Mastranto is one of the most emotionally charged I've ever seen. By contrast, "Avatar" did not make me care all that much about its characters. NONE of them.Worse, the movie is about as subtle as a punch in the snoot. James Cameron's disdain for what President Eisenhower dubbed "the military-industrial complex" is highly evident in several of his films, including "The Abyss" and "Aliens." Here, though, he takes it to absurd proportions. Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge and Stephen Lang's Col. Miles Quarich are both such caricatures that they might as well be cartoons. The former is your ultimate company man, and while Ribisi is a talented actor, he just can't do much with this, as the script has his character practically oozing contempt for anything that smacks of environmentalism or spiritual importance. The natives of Pandora stand in the way of wealth, and he'll do anything to erase them from the scene. As for Lang -- I don't think I've ever seen an actor so cheated out of something that could have been meaningful. He's very good, but Quarich is so absurdly gung-ho that his efforts in portraying him with any sort of complexity are completely wasted.Sam Worthington is likable enough as the protagonist, Jake Sully, but that's all he ends up being -- likable. Not truly heroic, which he should be.Performance-wise, that leaves Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, the former being a young actress (she played Uhura in the "Star Trek" reboot) and the latter being a veteran who has worked with Cameron before ("Aliens"). Saldana's Neytiri is probably the most compelling character in the film; Saldana works hard to make her so. Her respect for life and her world come off as completely authentic. Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine is the most COMFORTABLE character in the film -- a woman at home not only in her own skin but also in the body of her avatar. Weaver achieves this with a performance that's understated, not over the top.Ultimately, though, their efforts are overwhelmed by the sheer and sometimes dead weight of the film.I've read that Cameron is planning not one but at least two -- and possibly three -- sequels. I find myself very ambivalent about the prospect. Right now, my stance is that I suppose I'd see them if it were convenient, on an otherwise slow weekend. Or I could just as easily skip them.When he's at his best, Cameron is a terrific filmmaker. "Terminator 2" was heart-stopping, edge-of-the-seat action -- but somehow Cameron made it an affecting story as well, to the point that I could get a lump in my throat over the demise of a machine. With "Avatar," though, he let the special effects -- including the 3-D -- and the ponderous, preachy themes get in his own way.

In earlier years, John Updike's poetry often was referred to as "light verse" -- a term that also could be applied to humorous poets such as Ogden Nash. Even then, however, Updike's subject matter and style frequently transcended that label. Yes, his poems could be quite witty, but with subject matter ranging from youthful carnality to the corruptions of middle age and beyond, his was verse meant to be taken seriously, even if you were smiling as you read it.It turns out, though, that Updike had a lot of growing to do as a poet. Contrast this with his arc as a novelist: His first, "The Poorhouse Fair," seemed a bit unsure of itself, but his second, "Rabbit, Run," was extraordinarily accomplished -- and it was published in 1960, when Updike still was in his 20s. Certainly, Updike has grown as a novelist, but his development as a poet has been far more dramatic. Compare, if you will, the frothy ebullience of "The Carpentered Hen" or "Telephone Poles," two early verse collections, with the more tempered and more formal "Americana," and you will see that Updike's journey has been remarkable.This volume has Updike spinning poetic yarns about mortality, about travel, and about the raveling and unraveling of the human body with all its frailties. The work here is quite beautiful, yet in beauty there can be much heartbreak, and Updike is not afraid to explore it.Updike also has turned more and more to formal verse as he has aged; this volume offers quite a number of sonnets, and they are very good indeed. I don't mean to disparage his older efforts in free verse, but his command of language and form here is quite impressive.I highly recommend "Americana," especially for fans of Updike's novels who may not be very comfortable reading poetry. Updike's verse is accessible but does not pander.

I HIGHLY recommend this tape for hobbyists over generic painter's tape or other brands of hobby tape. Tamiya in general makes some really good products, including their paints. This tape is strong enough to stick but the adhesive is not so strong that it's going to damage your model or any well-cured paint under the tape.For curved areas of a model, use much shorter lengths of tape, with the length being dependent on the sharpness of the curve, of course.One other tip: Right before painting, I usually run my finger over the applied tape edge one more time to make sure it's sticking well. This is especially true if the surface is slightly uneven -- for example, a submarine with rivets detailed on the hull. You just want to make sure the adhesion is good and tight right before you airbrush, spray, or brush paint.This is, in short, good stuff. Make it even better by getting the appropriately-sized Tamiya dispenser.

I simply do NOT understand people who buy a 1/144 scale aircraft kit of any kind and then complain because the parts are small and some of the plastic is thin. It's INEVITABLE that you're going to have to deal with such parameters if you work on airplanes in this scale!So don't pay attention to the negative reviews of this kit. It's a good one, although I did manage to find some quibbles. As with so many ship and submarine models with their hull-fit issues, and so many model aircraft with their fuselage-fit issues, this model was somewhat problematic in that regard. Fitting the upper and lower fuselages together -- or rather the body/wings, since this is a "flying wing" aircraft -- required some skill. I personally use Tamiya masking tape to hold the two halves together, though I know some folks prefer hobby clamps. Either way, you MUST use one or the other so that the two halves don't pop loose while the glue dries.Cockpit: The model calls for extensive work on the cockpit, including painting the interior walls of the plane where the cockpit sits, and of course the cockpit seats and floor itself. There's also a decal for the instrument panel. I'm all for realism, but in this case, I think the instructions go a bit far, because once you install the canopy and get the body together, you really can't see in there anyway.DON'T forget to use a weight of some kind -- a fishing weight will do -- up front on the interior (the weight is not supplied). You need to do this so the finished model will sit properly; without it, the plane tilts back on its tail with the front landing gear off the "ground."Lastly, exercise care with the landing gear, especially the rear, and the bomb bay doors. All fairly small and fragile.I thoroughly enjoyed building this iconic military plane, and I think you will too if you simply take your time and understand the challenge of working with aircraft kits in this scale. Happy modeling!

Overall, the appearance of these films befit the greatness of a director known for his stunning visual style: The transfers are crisp, bright but not saturated, revealing in terms of the nearly garish color schemes Stanley Kubrick chose for some films, especially "A Clockwork Orange."I compared these transfers to my two previous Kubrick collections, both of which were issued on DVD. On those earlier sets, even Kubrick's later films could suffer terribly. Case in point: The print of "Eyes Wide Shut" used for the 2001-released box was truly wretched -- dark, smudgy, surprisingly grainy. And of course that version still included the infamous CGI figures in the orgy scenes, but my understanding was that was what Kubrick wanted at the time.There isn't a brad transfer on this new blu-ray set. As for the continuing argument over Kubrick aspect ratios, I think it should be a non-issue by now. HD and widescreen TVs and playback devices were not common home-theater features at the time of Kubrick's death. They're ubiquitous now, and I am convinced Kubrick would be appreciative of the wider aspects. Even a moderately priced, properly calibrated home theater system now can approximate the cinema experience, thanks to blu-ray's superior visuals and sound quality.Now the quibbles:1. If you're going to put out a set that includes nine films from a director who only ever released 12 (not counting the withdrawn "Fear and Desire"), why not just go ahead and do them all? Including "Killer's Kiss," "The Killing" and "Paths of Glory," along with the films here plus the included "Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures" bio would have made for a total of 13 movies, 12 of them stunning and one, the biopic, admirable. Fortunately, though, the re-releases of "Paths of Glory" and "The Killing" were given over to Criterion, which did a GREAT job -- Criterion even included a transfer of "Killer's Kiss" on the release of "The Killing." Thus, at this writing, all of Kubrick's films are available in high definition, which is as it should be.2. I've read numerous comments here about the packaging, pro and con, and I am going to have to come down on the con side. The cardboard slots for the discs are simply too tight (the opposite of most box sets, where the discs can shift around during shipping). Getting each disc out required a great deal of care. For fear of scratching them over time, I took mine out permanently and stored them in individual aftermarket sleeves. It may look klunky on the shelves, but it protects this investment.3. I found the "O Lucky Malcolm" documentary to be rather annoying and tiresome. Part of the problem is Malcolm McDowell himself. He's a great actor, no doubt, and Alex in "A Clockwork Orange" is his greatest role. I knew McDowell could be abrasive, and have no problem with that, but in this documentary he comes off as very self-aggrandizing. This was directed by Jan Harlan, Kubrick's brother-in-law and sometimes executive producer. Harlan also directed the "Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures" documentary, which remains part of this box set, and that film truly was moving and magical. Given a choice of a full-length actor bio for this box, I would have gone instead with the mysterious Keir Dullea from "2001" or the elegant James Mason from "Lolita."Again, these are minor objections to this set. I believe Kubrick to be the greatest filmmaker of the cinema's first century. I find I can view his films over and over and over again, finding nuances I had not considered before. It takes greatness to make art to which we are compelled to return, time and again. This set is a document of the man's genius.

James Blish, I have learned, is something of an acquired taste. I have read and enjoyed his science fiction and fantasy novels, novellas and short stories for more than 40 years, and many times have recommended his books to friends -- with decidedly mixed results. Some, like me, revel in the sheer power of Blish's imagination. Others are put off by a writing style that can seem clipped or muted or, at the very least, extremely restrained.For my part, I'm a person who never has needed that much "action" in his fiction. I think readers in general place far too much emphasis on plot, often at the expense of character development and setting and even the philosophical underpinnings good fiction can display. Given my values and biases, Blish turns out to be one of SF's perfect writers for me."The Day After Judgement" actually is a longish novella, not a novel, and in fact Blish regarded it as the second half of a novel, the first half being "Black Easter." In the early 1990s, in fact, years after Blish's death, a small publishing house called Gregg Press finally published the two parts as a single book under the title "The Devil's Day."So: Recommendation No. 1 -- Get "Black Easter" and read it before you read "The Day After Judgement." It's one story, with one set of characters, and a flow of events that can be summarized as follows: A perverse arms dealer (is that redundant?) contracts with a practitioner of black magic to loose all the demons of hell for just one night. However, once freed, the demons run amok; out of control, they unleash Armageddon. And, furthermore and most chilling, it appears that evil may be stronger than good after all -- that Satan may, in fact, win the ultimate battle.It's a mind-bending concept. And while I agree with critics of Blish that some of his writing can seem pretty staid at this point, he was not an author to adopt a shouting or hectoring tone. He presented his wild ideas and incredible stories with an almost casual approach. For me, Blish's matter-of-factness just makes them more believable, but I recognize that this writing style just doesn't work for some readers.In addition to considering "Easter and "Judgement" as two parts of a single novel, Blish also considered this novel -- "The Devil's Day" -- to be the third part of a trilogy he dubbed "After Such Knowledge," a quote from T.S. Eliot. The first two books are "A Case of Conscience" and "Doctor Mirabilis," both worth reading, but not sharing the same characters and situation.

"Quake III Arena" is, quite simply, the finest game ever produced in the Quake series, probably because it ascribes to so little: It's carnage, carnage, and more carnage, but getting those kills, particularly online, was gratifying. Find an old computer drive to mount this on and revisit its glory.

Guitarist Pat Metheny has made quite a few excellent albums, including early efforts such as "American Garage" and later recordings like "Beyond the Missouri Sky," but "80/81" stands out even from that august crowd. It might, in fact, just be his masterpiece. It's an extremely ambitious record that fulfills its lofty goal, which was this: Make an album that includes some beautiful solo acoustic and electric guitar from Metheny, but which also features hard-driven yet listenable bebop played by a group of five musicians."80/81" begins with "Two Folk Songs 1st | 2nd," with the first part being composed by Metheny and the second by bassist Charlie Haden. There is, however, no formal break between the two pieces, so I'm going to treat them as one song, which clocks in at 20 minutes, 53 seconds. As you can imagine, the song's length allows for some real stretching out by the musicians, which they accomplish without devolving into pointless noodling -- there is purpose behind every note here. Following the piece's introductory musical statement, we are treated to a short tenor saxophone solo played by the late Michael Brecker. It's a bit warm and breezy but far from sentimental, a perfect tone-setter for the rest of the album. Metheny takes the second solo, his guitar reinforcing that "warm windy day" feel Brecker had established. He then hands it back to Becker, and, at two minutes into the song, Brecker forsakes the breeze in favor of the maelstrom, unleashing in the third solo a flurry of squeaks, honks and squalls that recall John Coltrane's "sheets of sound" approach; one can also detect here the influence of Ornette Coleman's atonalities, though Brecker keeps pulling the music back to center, back to the land of rationality and logic. Just as you think the whole thing is going to come apart, for example, Brecker hands the spotlight to Haden, whose solo is understated but nimble. Haden's is the fourth solo of the piece; the fifth belongs to Brecker again, who plays it perfectly straight this time, re-establishing the piece's beautiful melody. Solo six is just a taste of Metheny's guitar again. In solo seven, Brecker once again leaps into that mysterious realm where the neat lines of harmony and counterpoint fall prey to some kind of bubble in the music-space-time continuum. As Brecker works his way back to the space men call "real," drummer Jack DeJohnette slowly pushes his way into the center spot for what will become the eighth solo on "Two Folk Songs 1st | 2nd." Any fan of jazz drumming is going to appreciate this beautiful solo, as DeJohnette establishes what sounds like a human pulse hammering at too great a speed. Working with nothing more than a couple of cymbals, a few toms, and a snare drum with the snares disengaged so he can get that raw plonking sound, deJohnette takes the first part of the piece home.For as deJohnette fades the volume down, playing softer and softer, Haden fades in with the ninth solo, and it's one for the ages -- his upright bass slowly, deliberately quotes the melody of the "Old Joe Clark" folk song that emerged from Kentucky's Appalachia mountains in the early 1900s. Haden then plays a passage he composed himself, with the rest of the band silent until first deJohnette and the Metheny tip-toe their way back in. Finally, Metheny picks out the first notes of the tenth solo of "Two Folk Songs 1st | 2nd," and what a solo it is! Quite simply one of the best of his clear, with his scalpel-sharp notes cutting the very air part, the better for us to hear the glorious sound of one of his big, hollow-bodied guitars. Brecker sits out this portion of the composition, which was a wise decision, as Metheny needed the extra room to wind it all up for us.I can't possibly review the rest of the album in as much detail as I devoted to this song, but that's all right; this opening anthem is emblematic of everything else you'll hear on "80/81." Some brief observations, though:The next three songs -- "80/81," "The Bat" and "Turnaround" -- each run six to seven and a half minutes, and generally are a bit "tighter" than "Two Folks Songs. Melodically, they're just as strong, and Metheny dominates them a bit more, especially the title track. Guitar-heads will get their fixes here!The next two songs, "Open" and "Pretty Scattered" constituted what used to be side 3, back in the old vinyl days. Beware, buyers, that you get the full "80/81" CD with these songs in their rightful place; early CD pressings of "80/81" omitted them so that the album could be issued on a single CD. True, they are the most challenging songs on the album, so maybe some listeners will be put off them, but not your true jazz fan. "Open," which clocks in at 14 minutes 35 seconds, sounds to me like it was improvised in the studio based on a theme Metheny had written, and it's the only song on the album credited to all the participants -- Metheny, Haden, DeJohnette, Brecker and second tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman. Near the beginning, Metheny's playing is nearly frantic, and those searching for a consistent beat will search in vain. "Pretty Scattered" is pretty accurately named; both Brecker and Redman play on it, and some moments find them soloing at the same time, either against each other or with little regard for what the other was doing.The last two pieces are no less than stunning. "Every Day (I Thank You)" has a warm, burnished feel thanks in large part to Brecker's resonant tenor sax part. "Goin' Ahead," the final piece here, runs just shy of four minutes, and features Metheny alone on guitar. Pensive but also emotional, it's the perfect end to a near-perfect album, which surely still stands as one of the greatest of Pat Metheny's career.

I guess other DVD releases of TV shows have spoiled me. When I buy something, I expect upgraded sound and video whenever possible. "Night Gallery" was a terrific show -- underrated, in fact, because of unfortunate comparisons to Rod Serling's previous classic, "Twilight Zone." This is a great collection, but I wish the studio had cleaned up the picture -- there aren't a lot of screen artifacts here, but enough to be distracting.Still, it's fantastic to have this. And kudos to the producers for including the excellent pilot, which starred Roddy McDowell, Ossie Davis, Joan Crawford and Richard Kiley in three separate stories.At this writing, I have not heard of any blu-ray release on the horizon. If we ever get that, maybe "Night Gallery" will get the technical sprucing-up it deserves.

Having previously built Revell's 1/144th scale version of the German Type VIIC U-boat, I decided to tackle its big brother, the 1/72nd version. While my build is still in progress, I have more than enough information by this point to write a fair and thorough review. In short, this is a VERY good kit, but it can be made even better with attention to detail and possibly the use of some aftermarket accessories available out there.First, the quality of the parts: Overall, they're sensational. I WAS a bit underwhelmed by the two hull halves. For one thing, there are large pieces of flashing to remove, and this has to be done very carefully to avoid chipping the model. I worked slowly using a combination of sprue cutters, modeling scalpel, and sandpaper to remove them.Also, the two hull halves are far from a perfect fit -- getting them glued together requires patience and good supplies, including modeling tape. I use Tamiya masking tape for all my sub builds, as this problem tends to be nearly universal. I start by applying a very thin bead of glue, then work my way from each end toward the sub center, taping as I go. Do NOT deviate from the instructions, which actually call for using tape -- let the cemented, taped halves dry for at least six hours or, preferably, overnight, then carefully remove the tape.I decided to use White Ensign's photo-etched parts kit to increase the model's realism. That kit includes, to cite one example, hatches for the torpedo tubes (important if you're going to build the kit with some of the forward tubes open, which is an option).I also bought a sheet of aftermarket flags. Revell and Revell of Germany will NOT produce authentic Nazi flags, so if you want your boat to be truly authentic, you have to get them elsewhere. I am sorry if this offends anyone, but its my model, and pretending that this ugly emblem did not exist is, in my opinion, absurd.Paint and decals: Decals are minimal, and pose no problem for the experienced modeler. Paint: You can choose several schemes based on which exact U-boat you decide to build. NOTE: For a model this size, I DEFINITELY recommend airbrushing or using rattle cans. Handpainting a model this size is very time-consuming, and it's awfully hard to hide brush strokes when dealing with such a large surface.Weathering: Steel boats rust. I strongly recommend Rustall or a similar product to produce that weathered, sea-ravaged look. Use sparingly; you can always add more coats.Revell is one of the industry leaders when it comes to sub models, and this large example is quite welcome. The company also has released a 1/72 version of the USS Gato WWII sub, and it's even bigger, since the real Gato was about 90 feet longer than the German Type VIIC. If you attempt either, take your time and enjoy the experience!

I tried to read this book with an open mind, but in the end, ended up just about despising the author. In his zeal to portray himself as a player on the Hollywood scene, Joe Eszterhas instead reminded this reader that sleazeballs just aren't all that amusing.In addition, this book IS MORE THAN 700 PAGES LONG. It should have been HALF that. I guess, though, that if you're the screenwriter who wrote "Basic Instinct," plus a lot of other films that altogether have grossed about a billion bucks (that's not an exaggeration), then you get to do pretty much whatever you want to do when you write your memoir. Eszterhas, for this project, desperately needed an editor to tell him when too much was getting to be ... well, too much.Perhaps I was expecting too much. This is the guy, after all, who wrote "Showgirls," quite possibly one of the five worst films I've ever seen.Since this volume was published, Eszterhas also has written "Crossbearer," a memoir about his return to faith. That book has gotten far better reviews than this one, so perhaps I should try it, and see if the author's rediscovered religiosity has made him a more sympathetic subject.As for "Hollywood Animal": Don't bother. I'm no moralist, but this book truly is repulsive.

Too much modern poetry is carelessly written. Not that free verse can't be meticulous; it can -- but far too many practitioners don't bother to expend the effort.Stephens' poems are beautiful exceptions. Unfortunately, at least one of the reviews on this site offers up some VERY crude misconceptions about this poet's work. First, many of the unrhymed poems here are NOT free verse as the reviewer suggested -- they are BLANK verse, and there's a big difference. Blank verse means the poem in question does not rhyme but DOES stick to iambic pentameter, a regular metrical frame built on the classic five-beat line of Shakespeare and Frost. Second, the poems here are NOT vulgar. Do some of them include what I and my childhood peers once referred to as "cusswords"? Yes, they do. But Philip Stephens' work never is intended to be low or coarse, nor does it come off that way."The Determined Days" is a stunning book -- and offensive only to those who would mistake honesty for corruption.

This is a phenomenal book, and I want to stress that the few criticisms I'm going to offer should not dissuade people from picking this up and reading it. With help from co-writer Leo Janos, Ben Rich has written a fascinating account of one of the most secretive and successful "black projects" outfits in American military history.Lockheed's "Skunk Works" was responsible for developing the P-38, but its real fame began to build as it concentrated on spy planes during the Cold War, specifically the U2 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich's account of the conception, construction and deployment of these two iconic aircraft is absolutely ... well, pun intended here ... RIVETING. The narrative is exciting; how could it not be? Here you had a secretive division of a major aeronautical contractor working on planes that would change the course of world history, and this division was facing deadlines, problems with materials, difficulties in coming up with new construction methods, and on and on. The Blackbird's use of titanium alone proved a major engineering hurdle, given how difficult that metal is to work with, but Skunk Works pulled it off...and the Blackbird remains the FASTEST air-breathing aircraft ever constructed, years after its retirement!Two brief criticisms: One, the "other voices" interludes sometimes break up the narrative flow a bit too much. But Rich being what he was -- the second leader of a highly complex organization -- would naturally feel drawn to this kind of structure, in which value is placed on multiple viewpoints. Two, and I can't believe I'm writing this: Most books, if length is a problem, suffer from being too long. With "Skunk Works," I was hoping it would last even longer. Again, though, the book's concision is indicative of its author's personality; Rich was a "get it done" kind of guy who belied the image of a greedy contractor stretching out a project for as long as possible. Skunk Works prided itself on making or even beating deadlines, and thus Rich the author wasn't going to write a bloated book.This is just a terrific read, especially for anyone interested in how successful organizations of any kind work, how America truly did win the Cold War, and how complexity challenges people with creative minds.
