MERE CHRISTIANITY represents an excellent distillation of Lewis' thought on the essential elements of Christianity. He knows, of course, that the word 'mere' can mean 'simple' or 'basic' but that it once meant 'pure' or 'essential'. This book gives you the supreme elements of Christian thought, but in simple, accessible terms. That is, of course, Lewis' forte--to depict the complex with a very light touch. Here he talks about such notions as human nature, Christian morality, virtue, and the triune God and he does so in chapter/segments slightly longer than sound bites. The reader is neither stretched on a rack of jargon and chop-logic nor asked to bear up under an onslaught of endless, vague verbiage. S/he is given the unvarnished truth of Christianity in clear terms and manageable segments. One can 'read in' the book, as one reads in the Bible or the Book of Common Prayer. This is the perfect introduction to Christian thought and the perfect introduction to the insights of Lewis the believer.

This is a superb book, but one that sets limits for itself. Its purpose is to delineate the visions which undergird the political impulses of the major political parties. It argues that the disparate visions are traceable to disparate beliefs regarding human nature. The 'constrained' vision can be traced to thinkers such as Hobbes, Burke and Adam Smith, the 'unconstrained' vision to thinkers such as Godwin, Condorcet and Rousseau. The consistency of the respective visions and the degree to which they cover a multiplicity of current issues is striking. It is almost as if some are born with one vision, others with another. Sowell acknowledges that some individuals have changed their visions, but often under 'road to Damascus' circumstances. Some have been persuaded by empirical evidence, though it is a truism (one reinforced here) that the respective visions are often resistant to evidence.The book is scrupulously objective in its goals. The book is analytic and descriptive, not polemical. Sowell goes out of his way to avoid choosing sides or offering compelling evidence for the inconsistency or absurdity of either of the visions. He is not recruiting readers to one side or the other. He is constructing two complex mirrors in which his readers can attempt to see themselves and the degree to which their individual views are part of a large, centuries-old pattern.My own sense is that he's got this right and he's used the best examples, though I might have added a touch more Rousseau to the mix. The objective analysis, however, comes with a price. In resisting the impulse to take sides and adduce evidence justifying the taking of sides he has written a book which is more theoretical/historical than historical/theoretical. In short, the want of copious examples is often felt. Also, the fact that Sowell is such an effective polemicist (when he is writing in that mode) makes one regret that he is here purposely confining and restraining himself. Nevertheless, the book is excellent and does exactly what it sets out to do--fairly, clearly and persuasively.For those with an interest in human nature (or its alleged nonexistence), one can also highly recommend Pinker's The Blank Slate, a nice companion volume to Sowell's and one that is less constrained in its arguments.

Perhaps a prince of our disorder, as John Mack entitled his biography of T. E. Lawrence, but a prince nonetheless. This is his last episode and you should see 'The Wench is Dead' episode first. Morse is ill; he has been on medical leave because of his stomach ulcers. His superior has taken over a case, but Morse comes back from leave and is assigned the case. In the meantime he has been investigating it anyway, to Lewis' chagrin and barely-controlled anger. The focus of the episode is their relationship; the case barely matters, except for the fact that the victim was one of Morse's nurses, one for whom he had special feelings. It is a family story, with members of the family among the suspects in the mother's death. It is also a family story in that it focuses on Morse's relationship with Lewis. I won't spoil the ending, which is very powerful, but listen especially for Morse's final words . . . and then Lewis'.This is exhibit A for those who seek to demonstrate that genre fiction (here, genre fiction dramatized) can sometimes rise to the level of art. In the case of Morse the art is achieved through the delineation of character and the study of human relationships. This is a beautiful body of work and a beautiful though poignant conclusion to it. It is all the more touching in that we know of John Thaw's own illness and the fact that it would be diagnosed a little over seven months after the screening of this episode.

The Redux version with its 49 minutes of additional material is valuable as a further meditation by Coppola and Murch on their original work. Both it and the original are great films, so there is no need to be picky. In my judgment, the French plantation and Playboy Bunny scenes do not add a great deal to the original and the redux version is very, very long at 197 minutes. Quibbles aside, AN remains an absolute stunner, worth the price of admission (or of the DVD) for Duvall's performance alone. Or for the sound, which is monumental.

Here, Andrew Davies has less propitious material than he had, later, with his production of Pride and Prejudice, but he does a superb job with an academic/historical/slightly political/romantic novel and a limited budget. The script is perfect, as is the acting. The interplay of British academics in a public school (i.e. what Americans would call a private prep school) is so close to reality as to suggest that we are viewing a documentary. The drama--with both romantic conflict and academic conflict--is muted but still very intense. The governors/trustees of the school are a special treat. After you watch the entire miniseries you will want to read the novel or check out plot summaries of it, since there are some changes between the book and the miniseries that will be of interest. Highly recommended.

Robert Crais is there. This is his best Elvis Cole novel to date and it's just about perfect. I like a little more retribution when it's called for and I would have added another dab or two of the old ultra-violence, but that's a small cavil. The plotting is exquisite, the characterization touching, and the themes resonant and pulsating. I don't want to spoil anything, but the rearrangement of part of Elvis' life with a look ahead to future plots is wonderfully clever.I am one who thought (as he himself feared) that Crais revealed too much about Joe in the previous novel but the revelations about Elvis here are apt. They work very well, as do further revelations about Joe.Reader warning: this is not the joking, wisecracking Elvis of yore. Things are far more serious this time and the unrelenting plot and dark, driving tone are sustained throughout.Powerful stuff. Bravo, Mr. C.

This is an interesting and informative book on an important subject. It concerns multiculturalism and political intolerance at Stanford in the 1980's. The authors (both now lawyers/businessmen/non-academics) were Stanford undergraduates. Thiel took his J.D. at Stanford; Sacks took his at the University of Chicago. If nothing else, the book demonstrates the quality of the Stanford experience and/or the ability of the admissions office to select students of quality because the book is well-researched, well-argued and well-written.It is a partisan book in the sense that it adduces evidence to support a particular point of view, one wholly inimical to the multiculture (as they term it). It is not, however, a flailing, mindless screed. It points to a multiplicity of events, interactions and facts. It names names and it provides a great many of the specifics germane to the case(s). Its arguments and narratives cannot simply be dismissed as reactionary or studiedly partial. If the authors have misused evidence or conveniently forgotten counter examples they should be challenged on the facts, not criticized, e.g., because of their later business success or their extensive use of campus journalistic records. Their frame of reference is far broader than that. To say that they were too involved in the issues and those issues' initial reportage is also to acknowledge that they were involved, personally and directly. Reporters are among our society's most notable writers of `instant history'. The degree to which that instant history will stand the test of time will ultimately be decided on the actual facts of the case(s).There is a great deal of analysis in addition to the reportage. They examine, e.g., the contradictions of the multiculture. For example, if that multiculture turns on the notion of victimology and individuals take their identity from their oppression, what happens when they are vindicated or receive power? Do they lose their identity? If that identity is dependent on their victimhood, what happens when that victimhood is ameliorated or even reversed? Are they dependent on the sustained allegations of oppression because its absence or mitigation would reduce their claims to moral authority?Their final argument is thoughtful and interesting. Essentially it is something like the following: the multiculture's grievances are with bad elements of European/American cultureS. In addition to those separate cultures (with both good and bad elements) there is something that is better termed `civilization'--the distillation of the positive elements of those separate cultures, best encapsulated in our country's founding documents in the phrase `natural rights.' (We would now say `human rights.') Those rights focus upon the individual. They privilege the individual over the desires of the collective. They are principles rather than shifting cultural practices. Sometimes we are faithful to them and sometimes not. They are a product of the enlightenment, but purged of some of the enlightenment's more negative impulses. Those principles should transcend the urgings of partial cultures, including the multiculture.All in all, this is a very engaging book. It is not one that will be enjoyed by former Stanford president, Donald Kennedy. In addition to looking at cultural/political issues the book offers a mini- case study that highlights some of the problems with contemporary higher education. In support of the multiculture, Kennedy expanded dramatically the administration and staff of Stanford (though not the faculty) and then fell victim to a financial scandal/fiasco. Using an indirect cost recovery rate far higher than, e.g., Berkeley's (which also does very big science in an expensive geographical area), it was discovered that a number of inappropriate items were funded through the overhead on federal grants (university yacht maintenance, antique furniture for the president's house, a wedding reception for the president and his new wife--an attorney working at the university, who replaced his wife of 34 years a scant 2 months after the divorce, and so on). The inference, of course, is that utopian collectivism often fails to live up to its promises, but the elites always manage to acquire an impressive number of perquisites and benefits along the way.The bottom line: this is a passionately argued book, replete with facts and incidents. The authors do infer that Stanford represents something of a special case here and that the majority of higher education institutions have not suffered from the extremes visited upon it. That is hopeful.

The premise is terrific: a cold case team consisting of a sitting Detective Superintendent and three former coppers, one a recent widower, one a much-married jokester, the third an obsessive-compulsive. The initial credits and theme music suggest that we're in for a lighthearted laugh fest. We're not. There is humor, much of it sweet and clever, but this is noir drama of a very high order. The scripts are tight, the acting superb, the characters endearing. I love British mysteries, with Foyle at the top of my pantheon, followed closely by Frost, Morse, Lewis, Midsomer Murders, et al. Move over guys and make room for the team from New Tricks. This is the real deal--first-rate crime drama as only the Brits can do it (consistently).

There is no such thing as a bad Jonathan Kellerman novel, but some are better than others. This standalone presents a number of problems. The protagonist is a close approximation of Dr. D, but with few of his more attractive traits. Dr. C is too tentative, too young, too soft. The plot is interesting and complex, a nice variant on an old theme, but with no interesting twists and turns. Finally, the setting is fictitious, so we lose some of the texture and local color associated with Kellerman's best work (e.g. BILLY STRAIGHT). Having said that, the narrative is lean, the story interesting, the writing always expert. I didn't devour the book, but I returned to it whenever I got the chance. This would be a top book if Kellerman were not a top talent who always raises our expectations. Read it, but wait for the paperback.

In some ways Righteous Kill is a waste of great talent. The story is conventional--a vigilante cop is killing perps who escape the legal system through technicalities. We've seen it all before. Here there is a twist--the apparent vigilante may actually not be guilty of the crimes. On that slender thread are hung the abilities of two of our greatest living cinematic actors. The film held my attention, though the subplot was shaky and the conclusion largely predictable. The supporting cast is effective and the direction is workmanlike. This is a rental.

Samuel Johnson famously said that 'at 77 it is time to be in earnest' and P.D. James is. She has not been a diarist but for this book she forced herself to become one. The book consists of a year's worth of diary with flashbacks and memories of the past. Structuring an autobiography is far more difficult and far more problematic than it may at first appear. Her solution here is certainly novel. Superficially, the book is an account of a year's events--speeches, book tours, lunches, and so on, but ultimately it explores the key events and key individuals of her life, with all the tears and joys attached. She evokes a vivid sense of the war and what it was like to bear and protect infants then; she speaks of her beloved husband's struggles with mental illness, the fact that she was forced to support the family and do so by wending her way through a government career after taking what Americans would think of as a continuing ed program at the City University in London. She is so literate, so polished, and so well educated that it is hard to believe that she lacks a formal college education. Her success as a writer came relatively 'easily', though that is always a relative term. It came early, but it did not come without great labor.Time to Be in Earnest includes wonderful reflections on the craft of writing and the specific culture of crime writing and interesting anecdotes about such household names as Ruth Rendell and Iris Murdoch. Phyllis James/Baroness James knows everyone and speaks of them honestly and in detail. She also tells us about her cat (named for Johnson's cat, Hodge), which I found more interesting than I expected. I loved her comments on modern culture--on travel, on cell phones, on education, on political correctness, political personages (including the Blairs) and such unexpected pleasures as an account of what it is like to spend the night at Chatsworth. In all of these matters she is scrupulously honest and scrupulously frank. The impact on her of Johnson and of the Jane Austen of the letters as well as the novels is clear.This is a delightful book and you do not need to be a fan of P.D. James's crime fiction (she would say detective fiction) to enjoy it. It is a very English book in every way, but it is also pure Horatio Alger--relatively poor woman hungry for butter during the war becomes Baroness James of Holland Park and doesn't change a great deal in the process. I had the great pleasure of meeting her once and talking to her for a few minutes. She is absolutely the genuine article--kind, direct, real with a capital R and authentic with a capital A. The book conveys that, without any arrogance and without any pretense. Read it and love her.

As a matter of fact, he does, though he's not writing now. For those who cut their teeth on Matt Helm novels or any of the other great genre fiction which he produced, it's a great treat to have this reprint of a 1954 novel. Thank you, Hard Case Crime. Night Walker is a pure genre fiction confection--a case of stolen identity with a good-hearted, slightly tarnished hero, a femme fatale or two, and some vintage postwar baddies.There are also some classic Hamilton touches--his traditional views of and observations on female dress and makeup, e.g. and a climax on the sea. For many years Hamilton has purchased and refurbished boats as a sideline and he knows them well. While reading Night Walker I thought of an old Hamilton favorite, The Mona Intercept. Anyway, here's some fresh Donald Hamilton to savor. Enjoy. And for those of you discovering him for the first time--you have a real treat in store. Years ago I read that he had sold over17,000,000 paperback originals. Read Night Walker and learn why.

Lee Child may be the most dependable writer working the mystery/suspense scene. While ONE SHOT may not be his best, it is very, very good, and remember--Lee Child's next best is way ahead of the rest of the pack. I am always impressed by this native of Cumbria's ability to nail the American landscape. He can do the desert southwest or coastal Maine. This time out Jack is in Indiana.The 'mystery' is not deep or convoluted and the plot is not complex and deeply imagined, but the story is crisp, the characters are interesting, and there are no wasted words. As always, one simply cannot stop reading once one has started. Lee Child owes his entire readership a good night's sleep and we all owe him our thanks for delivering so dependably.

The Wall is a great album; the movie, Pink Floyd-The Wall is a striking, moving, frustrating muddle. The images do not cohere in a unified narrative and at many points they overshadow the movie. The images are superb; the music is superb, but together they add up to less than the sum of their parts. This could all be explained away as a psychotic nightmare . . . fair enough, but art brings form to experience and clarifies it. When art simply reflects experience, with all of its chaos and incoherence (if that is what is happening here), we have a classic case of what Yvor Winters called the 'imitative fallacy'.How do images of rape/asexuality/drug-induced catatonia/fascistic display/the brutality of war/the peaceful tending of field rats cohere? They don't. We get it that Roger Waters is psychically riven because of the loss of his father in WWII. Why are the images here of the trench warfare of WWI?The overall effect of the film is one that suggests a loss of creative control (or a confusion of it). The center (in my humble opinion) should be the music, but the music is often overshadowed by the imagery, the background sounds and the (excellent) acting of Geldof. What should have been some of the titanic moments, e.g., Gilmour's soaring guitar solo at the end of Comfortably Numb, are lost amid the other sounds and visuals.This is a powerful film but, simultaneously, a great pity. We do, however, still have the music, and better still we have the album for which (as some critics said at the time) The Wall was only a prelude: The Final Cut, Waters' masterpiece.

This is an exceptional book. It is part history, part biography, part autobiography and from the point of view of a barbaric act, perhaps part `true crime'. Most of all it is a book about leadership and heroism. That heroism is Hitchcockian. A person perceived to be average (though he had been very successful, he was not a household name) was caught up in a devastating act of terrorism. His response to his circumstance was to lead and to discover/reveal his own, remarkable heroism.This is Howard Lutnick's story, told by a college friend, but using many of Howard Lutnick's words. The trade center is destroyed. Lutnick's company is nearly destroyed. Competitors are nibbling at the edges, hoping to capture market share. The company must be rebuilt amid the human and corporate devastation if the profits are to be generated to aid the victims' survivors. Meanwhile, those survivors' pain must be attended to as the aid agencies struggle to understand their task and begin to perform it and the media are seeking heroes, villains and mini-dramas.This is a powerful story, the telling of which falls into a real but simultaneously literary plot arc. It is a story of death and destruction that leads, ultimately, to recovery and it is told in a gripping way that does not call excessive attention to its art and craft. Its constant focus is on human emotion and human triumph in the face of overwhelming odds. This sounds, of course, like a promo for a Saturday afternoon serial or a movie of the week, but in this case the story is true, the blood is real and so are the debts, the profits, the emotional scars, the human loss.Personal disclosure: I am privileged to call Stuart Fraser (Howard Lutnick's cochair, partner and close friend) a friend. I came to know him better as a result of Tom Barbash's book. I visited him twice in his office at the trade center. I still have my pass from the final visit, which occurred a little over five months before 9/11. Cantor Fitzgerald's story is a very special one. Barbash notes that the founder of the company, Bernie Cantor, was a great collector of Rodin statuary. The Cantor offices had been designated the `highest museum' in the world. It was a place of art as well as commerce. Cantor's actions on behalf of the bond effort in World War II are not detailed here; he was an extraordinary man and this is an extraordinary story, one that every American should read.

Lewis begins The Great Divorce by talking about Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a marriage which Lewis finds impossible. Heaven and Hell must be divorced and all of his readers considering one or the other as an ultimate destination must realize that they won't be able to have it both ways. The two places are, by definition, different one from the other. You must embrace the joy that is heaven without reservation and you must renounce absolutely that which partakes of hell. The book itself, of course, is absolutist but it is also suffused with joy. Lewis' method of description/delineation of these alternate destinations is fantasy/allegory. His story moves along briskly and his arguments are sharply etched as they are embodied in spirits and those spirits' dialogues. This is not my favorite book of Lewis' but it is a nice introduction to his ways and his thought. It is also a very quick read.

Branagh's take on the Henning Mankell character, Kurt Wallander, is nothing short of superb. That 'take' is something of a hybrid. A British and Scandinavian cast speak British English and use British expressions and colloquialisms. At the same time, the stories are shot in Sweden and the Swedish landscape is a key element of the storytelling. Wallander himself is suitably Swedish (Mankell is married to Ingmar Bergman's daughter, it should be remembered) and he is played, many say, in an 'existentialist' manner. Wallander is like R. D. Wingfield's character, Jack Frost, in that his job is all-consuming, his personal life is generally in tatters and his persistence is legendary. Frost, however, is, by turns, a comic figure, who jokes with his colleagues and his criminal adversaries and interrupts his investigations to ingest hearty portions of Indian food. Wallander is deadly serious, his life deadly serious, his investigations deadly serious. Branagh plays him with mussed hair, razor stubble, flecks of detritus on his jackets and with moods just this side of despairing. The stories themselves, however, are not despairing. The plots are tight and more or less plausible. The acting is first-rate, with a strong supporting cast and the production values are absolutely top-notch. Shot with a light, digital camera, using exceptional set design and perfect lighting the stories have the look of big-budget feature films. Highly recommended.

I am a great fan of WKK's Cork O'Connor novels. Characteristically, they involve great characters, interesting mysteries, Ojibwe lore and northwoods atmospherics. In an ethos that is both vast (the lakes, woods, etc.) and small and enclosed (a Minnesota town, the Ojibwe reservation nearby) WKK takes his compromised but engaging hero, who is half white and half Ojibwe into the darkness of the past and into the darkness of the human soul to probe the mysteries that await him there.Purgatory Ridge is different. While the other elements of a WKK story are all in place here, this book is much more of a suspense/thriller than a mystery or crime novel. There are mysteries, of course, but the novel's two plots (an explosion at a lumber mill which is threatening to harvest a stand of pines that are sacred to the Ojibwe; the broodings of a half Ojibwe half white man whose brother was lost in a ship which collapsed in a storm on Lake Superior) come together in an elaborate kidnap/murder plot which threatens the families of the industrialist whose property has been destroyed and, as well, the wife and son of Cork O'Connor.Who are the kidnappers? And is there an additional individual behind the kidnap plot? The suspense is protracted, the saving of the kidnappees an apparent impossibility. There are knives, broken glass, duct tape and blood aplenty and the ending is a sixty page crescendo of death, revenge, and--the reader hopes--last-minute escapes.The result is one of the very best of the WKK novels, a novel that is faster in its pace and more urgent in its plotting than the other stories in the series. Enjoy.

The economy is destroyed when banks make loans to bad-risk borrowers. Those who have never been poor suddenly are and must cope with an altered reality. All of this sounds familiar, except that the movie was released in 1994. The protagonists, played by Peter Weller and Judy Davis, open up a boutique clothing store which promptly goes belly-up and its failure forces them to seek new 'opportunities'. Part comedy, part drama, part satire of L.A. materialism, narcissism, and trendoid culture, the parts never come together to form a seamless whole and the result is something of a genre mish-mash. There are clever scenes, memorable lines, good performances and some spot-on satire, but the film is not as strong as the script and the result is a cinematic misfire. Watch for interesting supporting parts played by Samuel L. Jackson, Adam West, John Diehl, Patricia Heaton, et al.

I come to DeLillo's Libra via James Ellroy's American Tabloid. Ellroy has his own take on the Kennedy assassination, but he praises DeLillo's take very highly. When Ellroy praises, I listen.I see now why Ellroy loves the book. DeLillo's take is very persuasive and executed with high art. DeLillo's Oswald is an alienated loner, seeking to connect with something important. He's not sure what that is--a momentous event, a large historical process? He distrusts all governments--ours, the USSR's, the Mexicans'--and moves mercurially between ideologies. He serves in the military; he defects to Russia; he leaves Russia; he flees his mother though she is the only steady point in his life; he marries a Russian woman but beats her and drives her away. As those who would seek to exploit him realize, he is both vague and weak but sometimes strong and determined. He has been bullied and brutalized in the past but he has somehow survived; he could be the perfect tool.It is an old principle in literary study that the more you get to know a character the more you like that character, even if the character is radically flawed. DeLillo is working against that principle and he does so successfully. The more we get to know Oswald . . . the more we get to know him. We do not like him; we simply begin to understand him as a figure more pathetic than malevolent, more sad than savage, more lost and doomed than the other characters in the shadows who populate his world.The other dark forces--Castro-hating CIA agents, bitter Mafiosi, uber-weird right-wingers like David Ferrie--are beautifully realized and ultimately part of the strange stew in which Lee Harvey Oswald ultimately finds himself. In capturing the characters DeLillo is capturing the times. He does that very well. He also captures the places, particularly New Orleans and Dallas, though we get a feel for Miami as well.DeLillo's structure is largely chronological, but he switches between characters and points of view and offers an overall impression that coheres very nicely. Much of the character depiction is phenomenological, with a summation of experiences, impressions, insights, glimpses, momentary realizations. This is very Ellroyesque and we can see DeLillo's influence in many ways.Finally, this is a piece of historical fiction which is very plausible, very moving and very, very sad. The writing is generally exquisite. The characters and events (as Conrad would say) have been very carefully contemplated. In Heart of Darkness Conrad writes of the `brooding gloom' that hangs over London and its environs. If it's brooding gloom that you want, here, in Libra, is God's plenty.Highly recommended.

This is not The French Connection, but Hackman is, as always, rock solid, and the supporting cast (particularly Tommy Lee Jones) is superb. The plot is improbable, with Russian and U.S. officers conspiring to continue the cold war and the case broken by a sergeant formerly married to a lieutenant colonel, who are basically operating independently against all of the forces that be. Their success (guaranteed in a quintessentially American movie) reaffirms American beliefs concerning independence and integrity while it provides some action/adventure in the process. The canvas is a little large and there are some gaffes and shaky production values, but this is a reliable way to spend a slow evening. It's also nice to see Hackman doing a credible high crawl through rough terrain in snow. He's the man.

This is a handy edition of ARRTI. It also includes other Mclean stories and features the marquee still of the Redford movie, featuring Brad Pitt (as Norman's brother Paul) illustrating his technique of 'shadow casting'. The novella (we would now probably call it 'creative nonfiction') is wonderful and far less linear and uniformly autobiographical than the Redford film version. The two complement one another very nicely, the novella providing wonderful anecdotes and the film spectacular images. ARRTI, considered as fiction, is a rare bird. It is actually a georgic mystery. The georgic is a hard pastoral, how-to form, in this case discussing the manner in which one does fly fishing (and sees it in the context of art, grace and faith). The mystery is twofold. Norman's brother Paul dies a violent death, which remains unsolved. Equally interesting, he stands as the center piece of Norman's memories, his mother's favorite son and the one described by his somewhat stern Presbyterian minister father as 'beautiful'. For all of his skill and beauty, no one fully understands him. We learn the details of his life, his behaviors, his skills and his attitudes, but he remains a mystery, even to those who should know him best.The narrative is 'realist' in its details, its setting and its (sometimes salty) language, but it is also scrupulously literary, as befits the work of a lifelong English teacher, one of the famous 'Chicago critics' in the 1950's. The book drops references to Izaak Walton, to Wordsworth (particularly the famous 'spots of time' passage in The Prelude) and, most importantly, to the Johannine logos. All of these references add up to a subtle and serious system of underpinnings for the straightforward narrative, one which all can enjoy.Very highly recommended (as is the Redford film, with the director doing strategic voice-overs).

I am a great fan of Connelly's standalones, particularly (but not exclusively) The Poet. The Lincoln Lawyer, however, is his masterpiece to date. The novel begins slowly. It is not ponderous or dull; Connelly is simply setting the stage very carefully. Once set, the action is nonstop. The courtroom scenes are masterful, the characters engaging, the ending satisfying. As a sometime journalist Connelly does not utilize legal nuance the way, e.g., Steve Martini does. As a journalist, however, he has a greater sense of place and the feel of the streets and the sweat beneath a damp collar. The architectonics of the trial--the traps set and then sprung--are beautifully wrought and the overall plot arc most impressive. Don't miss this one and don't worry about setting aside the time to read it. Once you begin you won't stop and you'll end with a thirst for more. This could be the start of a new series.

Why pure? Because this is a linear mystery, with multiple plausible suspects and a kicker ending. It's pure because Morse is in his element--tilting with his superior, attending chamber music concerts in his tuxedo and encountering women in whom he might, ultimately, have a personal interest. It's pure because the core of the story concerns his relationship with Lewis. Lewis has been involved in an earlier investigation with the obnoxious and arrogant DCI Johnson. A murderer has disavowed his earlier confession of guilt for a murder (the fifth; he's responsible for the first four). Morse wants to press on and reopen the investigation. Johnson is indignant, angry and combative. The Thames Valley administration wants to keep everything swept under the rug. Lewis is caught in between. Johnson dangles a promotion in front of Lewis' eyes and feeds his concerns that Morse doesn't fully appreciate him or utilize him well. You can guess the rest. The ending brings Lewis and Morse together in an Oxford wood, with a dead body and with the victim's killer, armed with a shotgun. There's blood all over the place and the potential for more. Then comes the very satisfying but still unsettling ending.

While I prefer the Morse episodes that involve philosophic talk, Deadly Slumber is a rock-solid mystery. The report of a putative suicide is investigated. The dead man is a doctor who has, with his wife, been operating a private clinic. They have a son doing a D.Phil in philosophy at Oxford. Morse thinks the suicide is hinky and the coroner confirms his suspicions. The man was killed. But whodidit? The prime suspect is the father of a young woman consigned to a vegetative state as the result of botched, simple surgery at the clinic. Then things get interesting, as Morse develops a relationship with the suspect and his ventilator-dependent daughter. The script by Daniel Boyle is superb--a sort of Prime Suspect without the edgy language and the frenetic action. There's no anger here; we've moved past it. The script takes the few possible suspects and crafts from that list a complex, plausible, striking but not surprising mystery story. The prime suspect is played by Brian Cox, here in a very soft, touching mode. All in all a mystery lover's delight.

This is a nice outing for Morse--a linear tale with minimal twists. A convicted rapist has escaped from prison and is returning to Oxfordshire for several purposes. The first is revenge; the second seems to be to torment and taunt Morse by assuming seemingly-impenetrable disguises. The putative action involves devil worship, but Morse immediately perceives that the evil here is human and not supernatural or metaphysical. The catch-me-if-you-can story involves a twist or two but I won't spoil it by revealing them. There is some interplay between Morse and Lewis and a few Morsean one-liners, but the focus here falls upon the plot and the clever villain.

This is one of the very best of the Morse series and a don't miss for series fans. It's a don't miss for multiple reasons. First, it's directed by Danny Boyle and the production values are especially impressive. Second, it involves a great deal of talk. Morse is at his best when he's talking and he's at his very best when he's talking to Lewis in personal and philosophic terms. The bond between them is at the core of this episode. It begins with a death in Morse's family, a death that leads to him taking personal leave. Lewis is farmed out to another inspector, one with whom he is far less sympathetic than with the irascible Morse. The later reflections on life and family between Lewis and Morse heighten their relationship and, in the case of Morse, reveal crucial details of his private life. The episode includes a nice performance by Jason Isaacs, now the quintessential baddie as well as the baddie here. There is also a brief appearance by Anna Chancellor. The overall story concerns young people committing suicide for no apparent reason. The solution involves the ingestion of designer drugs taken at raves. The story is fine and interesting enough but it takes a back seat to the relationship between Morse and his family and Morse and his current family, i.e. Lewis. Morse even calls Lewis 'Robbie' in a very special moment. In my experience, stories succeed when they do what they are designed to do, when they do what they do best. Morse is, finally, about Morse, his pomps, works, quirks, problems, wisdom and courage in the face of darkness. Here he is at the top of his form.

This is a very special episode, for Morse is taken ill and is 'in hospital' for much of the story. While there he takes an interest in a Victorian murder case. With the help of a young assistant he solves the case, reversing the Victorian verdict. The story cuts between present time and Victorian times, with the case reenacted in period costume and sets. The production values are very high; the story is fascinating and even the ulcerated Morse energized and effective. There is only one problem. Lewis is off to Inspector school and is not in this episode.The case concerns the murder/rape/robbery of a young woman, travelling to London via the canal. She is the former assistant of a magician who was her first husband. Or so we are told . . .Highly recommended.

First caveat: this is not a search for the perfect meal. Tony admits that such a concept is ludicrous (p. 272). Actually, a delightful search for the elements of such a meal is the subject of WHO IS KILLING THE GREAT CHEFS OF EUROPE? (1978), with George Segal, Jacqueline Bisset, and the great Robert Morley, a tale that is structured far more effectively than A COOK'S TOUR.This tour is reminiscent (beyond homage) of one of Michael Palin's, in which the world's garden spots are bypassed in favor of treks up foetid rivers in uncertain vehicles. Tony gushes over Vietnam, drags us to Cambodia, and skips Italy. He expresses his love of haggis and manages to stomach a still-beating cobra heart, but then joins the throng of obeisant admirers of the French Laundry in Yountville. He blisters his body in an overheated Russian sauna, then jumps into frozen waters. Sorry, Tony; include me out.Of course, none of this matters. The book is not about food; it is about the ethos of food and Tony's reaction to that ethos. That reaction is always interesting. How many people can write a book this uneven and yet consistently sustain the reader's attention? Tony's take on food and the people who create and enjoy it has not changed substantially from KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, though A COOK'S TOUR pays more attention to the diner's perspective than that of the cook. For a cinematic representation of the New York kitchen of KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, see the excellent film, DINNER RUSH. (And when you make your pilgrimage to the notoriously noisy Les Halles, simply skip lunch, eat an early, quiet dinner, and enjoy. Yes, the wait staff all love Tony and yes, the frites are fabulous.)In short, this is a book for those who can't get enough of Tony and his take on things. Their number is large and growing. That take is more or less libertarian, the point (as was often said in the 60's) where the far right and the far left meet. The result is a point of view that is politically incorrect, gonzo, but also commonsensical. It is a welcome voice in many ways, but Tony--forget the haggis and the still-beating cobra hearts. Take us to Vina del Mar for some pisco sours or to any of the restaurants in Cortona. Let Michael Palin get eaten by bugs. Take us to the Dordogne.

This is a wonderful film that the entire family can enjoy (without watching a cartoon). It has the further benefit of being based on a real person's life and experience. In some ways it is Dick Vermeil's story as well as Vince Papale's. Both are embarking on long-shot careers. The fact that we know how Vermeil's will turn out provides reassurance that Vince's will turn out well also. A sweet and engaging film about individual aspiration, family, neighborhood, and friendship. Watch it with your kids without any fear of embarrassment. How often can you say that today?

It is a great service to scholarship to keep this wonderful book in print. As the reader might know, Lucas was a Cambridge academic with service in the great war and brilliant service at Bletchley Park during the second world war. He was on Hitler's hit list of intellectuals to be murdered if and when the Nazis conquered Britain.Lucas was a poet, editor, translator and expert on literature and psychology. The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal reads like a book by a very old and very wise man; Lucas was 42 when it was published. The book explores `romanticism' (which he describes as the exploration and freeing of the unconscious) from antiquity to the present, in Greek literature, Roman, German, Italian and, principally, English and French. There are many long, untranslated French quotes in the text, a possible obstacle for the modern reader.While Lucas is sympathetic to romanticism he wants it to be done very, very well and he is aware of the dangers when it descends into decadence or silliness. Given its prominence in his time and its remaining prominence in ours, his voice is a very important one.It is the kind of voice one seldom hears in contemporary literary criticism. Lucas takes firm stands, offers lean and pointed distinctions and discriminations, names his favorite writers and skewers those of whom he is not particularly fond. It would be uncommon today because of the breadth of its references and because of the author's facility with language. It is also distinctly uncommon since it rather suddenly ends with a travelogue essay on Iceland (with many reflections on the medieval saga literature and its potential importance for us today).In short, this is a splendid book--important for scholars but a beautiful read for the lover of poetry who enjoys a sweet and strong voice.

Although the Ojibwe Windigo makes a very brief appearance at the end of The Devil's Bed, this is quite different from William Kent Krueger's Cork O'Connor novels. The protagonist is Bo Thorsen, a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the president's wife. She hangs out on the family farm/orchard outside of the twin cities and there is considerable concern that a former government operative, now gone rogue, is determined to kill her.He is also interested in killing her father, a former vice-president who (he believes) has, like his daughter, betrayed him. The first lady's marriage is on shaky ground and all who see her (including Bo Thorsen) have a tendency to fall for her. The question is--is the real threat to her survival the rogue government operative, David Moses, or is it her father-in-law, a long-serving senator who will go to any lengths to advance the political fortunes of his son, even if the son disagrees with his methods?Moving in and out of favor with the Secret Service, Bo discovers a little-known government agency with its fingers (make that: tentacles) in every other branch and division of the national government.In some ways the agency-gone-rogue story is a very old one. It is an old one, however, because it works in fiction and may well be a problem in reality, though not usually to the degree that it is in The Devil's Bed. So basically we have a D.C. thriller, largely set in the author's home town, with lots of bad guys, lots of ordnance, and overarching doubts about who can be trusted and who, absolutely, cannot.The characters are interesting and well-wrought, but this is a book driven by plot and driven very well. There is one native American character in a minor role and, as mentioned above, a brief discussion of the ice-hearted, flesh-devouring Windigo, a figure who arises in several of the Cork O'Connor novels.I hated the cover, but loved the book. The cover was fairly uninspired and gave me the impression that this was a kind of throwaway, to be read only when the Cork O'Connor list had been exhausted. This is not the case. This is a terrific page-turner that introduces a character--Bo Thorsen--who I would love to see return in another novel. There is less texture here, less Ojibwe lore, and none of the cast from the Cork O'Connor novels, but WKK is on his home turf in the twin cities and he manages to exploit the location to considerable success as he presses forward with his pile-driver plot. Enjoy.

A mother has left the (to her) cloying world of motherhood and become an over the road trucker. The child's father has had custody for the last ten years of his 11 year-old's life and is loved deeply by his son. When he contracts cancer and his wife's parent dies, the father turns to the trucker to take care of the son while he enters the hospital to either recuperate or die. The mother and son begin with recriminations, anger and harsh words, move on to understanding and end up loving one another (all as one would hope and expect).Michele Monaghan as the mother, Diane, carries the movie and she does so expertly. James Mottern's direction is strong, the production values high, particularly considering the twin facts of a 19-day shoot and a one and a half million-dollar budget. This is a small film, but done very nicely with superb performances all around. It is a story about love and responsibility, the latter a slippery notion for Diane, who has abandoned her son but built an economic life by scrimping to complete the payments on her truck and making progress on the mortgage-free ownership of her one-bedroom house somewhere in a place like Barstow. Her self-indulgent private life, which consists of hard drinking and one-night stands, is about to change and we enjoy her (and her son's) somewhat uneasy but altogether predictable transformation. This is a small gem.

Viggo Mortensen is now among the top two or three actors in Hollywood. Both an intellectual and an exceptional physical actor, he is an utter pleasure to watch, even when many of the scenes in Eastern Promises are spurting blood in all directions. The violence coexists with a sense of almost minimalist control and precision--in Mortensen's and Watts's acting and in Cronenberg's direction. In some ways this is a small film, but it packs a huge punch. It is circumscribed without being claustrophobic and the use of language--English, Russian, Ukrainian, et al. adds texture without being distracting. This is superb work. I loved A History of Violence and I consider Eastern Promises its equal. The films are similar in concept, though very different in setting and context. This is adult filmmaking in which the sex, violence and nudity are appropriate to the story and--though very explicit--are muted by the powerful story and engaging characters. Don't miss this one.

Just a word of warning. The subtitle of the book suggests that its overarching theme is the relationship between well-meaning theory and disastrous real-world results. Since this is a collection of discrete essays the 'theme' is much more a leitmotif. The essays themselves are superb, but they are ultimately freestanding. What links the pieces and unifies the book is (as always) the personal vision and deep experience of the essayist. This particular essayist happens also to be very well read and a highly-skilled writer. Five stars for the essays qua essays, but don't take up the book expecting a rigorous, detailed argument on the relationship between cultural theory and cultural catastrophe (though Dalrymple is doubtless capable of writing such a book).

The elements are all there--a film based on a famous novel, great cast, good direction, good production values, nice location shooting. Then, smack dab in the middle of an espionage/adventure story is what was probably an unintentionally-comic performance by Larry Hagman. This dvd has been bubbling to the top of many sale bins. It's worth watching and it does hold your attention, even though the story is a tad preposterous and there are too many genre twists and turns. At several points you will ask yourself, "What is this movie trying to be?" For those seeking Larry Hagman's most over-the-top, wiggy performance, this is a don't miss.

I say 'magisterial' because the book draws authoritatively on a vast amount of prior research for its conclusions. Though not a textbook, it could be used as one. The author approaches the key questions with regard to human sex differences posed by contemporary psychologists and summarizes the relevant research (all of the relevant research, it seems). Rich in references, the book is not ponderous or unwieldy. It neatly summarizes its conclusions and lays out all of the evidence for those conclusions. It is also scrupulously honest with regard to scientific consensus. It does not overstate its own claims or lean exclusively on those studies which validate its conclusions. The author gives the reader a clear and explicit sense of the degree of consensus, issue by issue. Its strengths are its lucidity, its completeness and its fairness.Personal disclaimer: the author is a friend and colleague. I would not review the book if it argued for a narrow or highly controversial point of view. Its value is in its thoroughness and openness to multiple views. It was useful to me as a non-psychologist. I wanted a sense of the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding sex differences and this book provided just that.

Some people wait for the next Harry Potter, devouring it the moment it appears and then waiting, impatiently, for the next. I wait for the next Jack Reacher. Lee Child does so many things well that I would need many more words than the 1,000 permitted to do them justice, but suffice to say that he is the absolute master of tension and suspense (with or without car chases), he has one of the most interesting protagonists currently in the game, he has a better knowledge of ordnance than Q and he has a highly skilled sense of place, particularly for an Englishman from Cumbria concentrating on the nooks and crannies of gothic, backroads America.PERSUADER finds Jack in a chance encounter with an old enemy. The thrust of the novel then becomes the neutralizing of this enemy through a relationship with an intermediary. Child quick-cuts between the horror of the past and the impending justice of the present, so that we travel two roads, the first appalling in its evil, the second delicious in its payback. The timing is perfect, the execution precise.I wouldn't rank one of Child's books above the others because they are all uniformly strong. He had it right from the beginning and he never disappoints.

With all of the drivel at the video store, here's a pleasant surprise. This is an excellent film--not quite academy-award level, but just this side of superb. The acting is exceptional. The script is pure silk, a mystery that observes every rule and still startles you with its straightforward solution(s). Nothing is hidden, but the ending is a revelation in every sense of the term. Hopkins and rural-accent Gosling play off of one another like Hannibal and Clarice, but this time they're on different sides for the duration.With most rentals I keep checking the 'time remaining' screen. With this film it was over when I thought it was half-finished--two hours flying by in what felt like sixty minutes. It grabs your attention from the opening scene and doesn't let go until it's done wringing you out like a damp wash rag. Go for it.

This is, of course, a classic in American historiography as well as the Non-Fiction Pulitzer Prize award winner in 1964. The bottom line: it is as relevant today as it was when it appeared in the early 1960's.The book is built upon a key insight, the essential difference between intellect and intelligence. "Intellect . . . is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of mind" (p. 25). We have always valued it less than raw intelligence or practical expertise. We pay applied scientists more than basic scientists; we pay orthopedic surgeons more than we pay laboratory scientists seeking to cure cancer or arthritis. We are skeptical of `eggheads' and those who dwell in the world of `theory' rather than fact.Why? In part because of our religious fervor and the nature of that fervor. In part because of well-meaning but wrongheaded educational theorists. In part because of our politics and our practical culture.Hofstadter does not enter this culture war with an uncritical sense of intellect's claims. He knows, full well, with Orwell that there are some notions so silly that only intellectuals could entertain them and it is entirely possible that he would share William F. Buckley's desire to be governed by the first 100 names in the Boston phonebook rather than by the Harvard faculty. He does not take a partisan position that is essentially uncritical or nave. He knows the world of the intellectual in his blood, bone and marrow because, in his relatively brief life, he was a leader there.The book is a very thoughtful one, characterized by an exceedingly broad range of subject matter (from Puritan sermonizing to differing responses to Dadaism and the beat `generation'). At bottom, the book's genius lies in its understanding of the issues and its ability to trace the etiology of our current situation.The long and the short of it is that we now live in a world of specialization, specialization that is often detached from intellection. Intellection may be dangerous and its missteps sometimes striking but at its heart (the critical, creative, contemplative) it is essential to human life and culture. Until the 19th century (one might say, especially in the 18th century) intellect and power were far more closely aligned. The period's thinkers "hoped that knowledge would in fact be broadened by a conjunction with power, just as power might be civilized by its connection with knowledge" (p. 427). This is the ethos of the founding fathers. As Hofstadter writes, Jefferson read Adam Smith; President Eisenhower read western fiction.However, the society of the 18th century was unspecialized. "Today knowledge and power are differentiated functions" (p. 428). And at what cost? We can grant the difficulties accompanying the growth of knowledge. How possible can it now be to have a figure such as Goethe who could participate in politics on a large stage, write one of the enduring masterpieces of western letters, make contributions to light and color theory and achieve a major discovery in comparative anatomy? But what of an education system which often gives up any thought of generalized genius at the outset? Speaking as an intellectual, with the same stature as Hofstadter, the great Yale historian Jaroslav Pelikan once commented that most great leaps in scholarship occur because of general education, because, as per Kuhn, most researchers are doing routine work, in tunnels. What takes them out of those tunnels are insights and perspectives drawn from other disciplines. What are the prospects for such breakthroughs when we opt for pragmatic vocationalism rather than classical liberal arts education?While performing the historian's task of elucidating the causes of our current circumstance, Hofstadter invites us to consider the implications of that circumstance and the larger questions which it entails.One might quibble with details; e.g., in his discussion of religion, Hofstadter contrasts reason with emotion. Hume (in his decisive discussion of the two) would have said `faith' rather than `emotion', though in fairness to Hofstadter, pivotal elements of American religion are decidedly emotional. The possible quibbles, however, are dwarfed by Hofstadter's achievement here. This is a very, very important book.

This is an absolute dazzler. Robotham is one of the most exciting new voices in crime fiction. LOST has it all--a superb plot, engaging characters, pitch-perfect writing, some memorable bon mots and a magnificent sense of setting.This is noir, London style. We're on the docks and in the sewers, and dodging the city's many underground rivers. The subterranean scenes are brilliantly executed and they manage to be intense without being too claustrophobic. The characters who guide Ruiz through this dark, watery, rat-infested London are straight out of Dickens.Robotham lives in Australia, but he knows his London like a native and he has a perfect feel for the Russian underworld there. I don't want to inject any spoilers, but he has a scene at a dacha outside Moscow which is also authentic to the point of being painful.I finished this book and purchased Robotham's next a few moments later. Do not miss this writer or this book. He understands the genre and his prose is exquisite. This is the real deal.

The new AFI top 100 film list appeared today and Patton was absent. I will not disparage the films that made the list, but at least 20 of them are lesser films than this masterpiece: oscars for best picture, actor, director, and script. This is a great war film, a great biographical film, a great film. The dialogue is consistently memorable, the set pieces unforgettable. Scott is brilliant; this is his masterwork (in a career consisting of multiple contending efforts). If you have not seen this film see it now. As one of my college teachers once said, "If you have not read The Brothers Karamazov go directly to the library and do it. You might die without having read it." The same advice applies to Patton.

I have no idea what this book is intended to be or do. I can tell you what it is not. It is not an account of Adolph Hitler's youth that explains his adulthood. He barely appears in the book until the very end and we learn nothing about him that is in any way provocative, interesting or fresh. The book principally concerns his father, Alois and his womanizing, beer drinking and beekeeping.The book is not an account of the good and evil in men or at least not a searching or interesting one. Ten pages of Conrad, e.g., are more instructive than the nearly 500 pp. here.The book is not an exploration of the divine comedy or economy. The Manichean accounts of God's weakness (but apparent dominance) and the devils' strengths (but limitations) are done in a very simple and sketchy fashion. We do not, e.g., receive extensive information on either the divine or demonic spiritual hierarchies and the implicit theology of the book is elementary and, to be polite, strange.The book is not a nonfiction novel. It is not a true crime book. It is not a bildungsroman. Structurally and generically it is a hash. It is, however, an interesting exploration of life in late 19thc rural Austria and the work of a Customs bureaucrat in search of a hobby. The demonic narrative of D. T./Dieter/Jr. Devil is almost totally irrelevant to the story and can be largely forgotten while the book is being read. The book does hold your interest and it has moments of insight.For a time I thought that the book was going to become some grand allegory on a contemporary political subject, but that turned out not to be the case (except in an aside or two).My advice to potential readers is to pay no attention to most of the editorial reviews of the book. What they say, by and large, does not correspond to the principal thrusts of the book. They are telling you what they expected the book to be, not what the book is, and they are either cutting Mailer a great deal of slack or seeing the book as a flawed masterpiece. Actually, the book is fine--if you want to read about Alois Hitler's life as a customs officer and beekeeper.

This is an absolutely superb collection. The A&E; Shackleton, featuring Kenneth Branagh, is beautifully directed, powerfully acted and faithful to the facts of what happened. The danger here is that the adventure elements could be lost and the grinding facts of hunger, cold and life on the ice floe dominate. Without understating the challenges, the film captures all of the constituent elements--Shackleton's personal conflicts (and loves, both licit and illicit), the financial ruin of his brother Frank, his fundraising challenges, the presence of WW I in contemporary consciousness, the adventure story itself and its powerful resolution.The subsidiary material is spectacular--the Biography channel Shackleton, an extensive study of Antarctica, biographical material on Branagh, etc. and, perhaps most interesting, a special on the making of the film, with extensive coverage of the ethos of film production--meals, pep talks, challenges with regard to the shooting schedule, improvisation and the vagaries of Greenland/Iceland weather. I especially liked the intercut footage from the original expedition and the degree to which the current production achieves its considerable authenticity.Highly recommended. Branagh is excellent. Watch for a nice performance by Robert Hardy as the pivotal sponsor, James Caird.

(Actually four and a half stars.) Dennis Lehane's new novel is an ambitious docudrama of Boston in the period between the first world war and the 1919 police strike. A number of interesting real-life figures are part of the narrative, principally Babe Ruth (who is about to be traded to New York) and such governmental/political figures as J. Edgar Hoover, Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, et al. The story concerns the historical events of this period as they impinge upon two principal individuals: a black man from Ohio via Tulsa and an Irish police officer. The events of the period, including the great influenza epidemic and the police strike, are rendered very effectively. The central fictional characters are interesting and engaging and they find themselves at the center of important events in dramatic circumstances. The novel is very long, but it picks up momentum in the second half. Lehane's take on Boston and on the Irish who both afflict and protect it is absolutely pitch perfect and extremely impressive. This is the most 'philosophic' of Lehane's novels, with many trenchant observations and beautiful lines.Lehane is a very ambidextrous writer, but readers should always be aware that he frequently moves beyond the world of detection and the world of crime fiction and works in other forms and subgenres. The Given Day is crime fiction cum historical fiction and one can already imagine it as a successful miniseries. The characters, however, are not as compelling as those in, e.g., Mystic River and the wider canvas sacrifices depth for breadth. As a meditation on the historical and cultural reality that is Boston it is absolutely superb. I recommend the book highly, but I advise readers that this is a departure for Lehane and will not be for all tastes.

Roger Ebert once commented that Michael Caine never gives a bad performance. Neither does Gene Hackman and neither does Walter Matthau. This is one of his best. Medical humor always seems to work. Here it soars, with the help of Glenda Jackson, Richard Benjamin, and--in one of his most hilarious roles--Art Carney. The subplots are also well done. There's even a brief appearance by Matthau's real-life son.This is the sort of movie you can watch again and again and the underlying story is sweet and loving, not cruel like The Odd Couple or long in the tooth like Grumpy Old Men. This is Matthau at the top of his rumpled powers, playing a skilled surgeon with notable human failings ripe for redemption.

This is a fine biography of O'Brian, particularly in light of the problems faced by the author. In the first place, O'Brian attempted, at every turn, to suppress all knowledge of the facts of his early life. King was not, in short, an 'official' biographer who was presented with stacks of diaries and journals and invited to ask any question that might occur to him. Nevertheless, King was able to ground his narrative on a bedrock of serious scholarship and a first-hand awareness of his subject's work, ethos and experience.It is said that a successful biography requires a degree of affection for the biographical subject, something that is complicated when that subject is, by turns, both secretive and irascible. The subject was also quite capable of utilizing his impressive erudition as a weapon, one that he could use as both a stiletto and a bludgeon. King is honest with regard to O'Brian's nature and shortcomings, but (without overlooking them) sees past them to O'Brian's significant strengths as a man and as a writer. Material success came relatively late, but O'Brian labored diligently, trusting in his monumental project and following his own lights. His tenacity and dedication make his eventual recognition all the more sweet and King charts the travails but also luxuriates, with O'Brian, in that ultimate recognition. The result is a narrative with a plot arc that one would expect to find in fiction, but here finds in real life.I am not a fanatical O'Brian devotee and came to the book as a lover of good biographical writing. O'Brian fans, however, will relish the book as will students of biography. Ultimately it is very hard not to love a dedicated, talented individual whose tastes run to Jane Austen and Samuel Johnson and who feels utterly at home in the eighteenth century.

The third story in the Millennium series begins precisely where the second ended. Lisbeth is taken to the hospital. Shot three times and buried alive, she needs emergency brain surgery to remove a bullet. Her father is still alive and her half brother is still on the prowl. Eventually Lisbeth is transferred to a Stockholm jail where she awaits trial for attempted murder. In this story we learn the big backstory--not just Lisbeth's relationship with her father and half brother, but the relationship between Lisbeth's father and a secret security unit, unknown even to the Swedish prime minister. These characters are anxious to remain anonymous. That means eliminating witnesses (or, in Lisbeth's case, consigning her to an asylum, permanently).Here's what to keep in mind. You should not pay any attention to film critics who fail to perceive the film's genre. Just because there are three books in the series, with a repeating cast of characters, you should not expect all three of the stories to be the same. The first story is actually a 'locked room' mystery (a locked island mystery, to be precise). The second story is very plot-driven, with far fewer atmospherics and the flavor of action/adventure. The third story is quite different. This is a legal thriller. The 'complaint' that Lisbeth spends half of the film in the hospital and the other half in court is unfair. Hey, this is Lisbeth. Do you really think she's going to sit idly by and not play a pivotal role in her own defense? And besides, we have the posse to end all posses: Blomkvist and the Millennium team, Lisbeth's former employer at the security agency and last, but most certainly not least, her hacker pal, Plague. They are supported by Blomkvist's sister, who serves as Lisbeth's defense attorney, and a whole security team, investigating the secret security team. There's plenty of conflict here between good and evil to satisfy any viewer and as the camera shifts from good guy to bad and the layers of Lisbeth's defense case are assembled, the (more cerebral) plot is riveting.Finally, I don't want to give anything away, but trust me on this--Lisbeth is not going to be in the hospital or the court room forever. Her crazed half brother is still at large and he's got some serious 'splainin to do, except that Lisbeth may cut that discussion short, in a way that only Lisbeth could conceive and execute. The final scenes are, shall we say, very, very memorable.As always, the direction is superb, the acting pitch perfect and the ending more satisfying than I could express (without spoiling it for all of you).Given the genre and given what the film aspires to do, this is the top film in the series.

Based on what were originally a set of public lectures, Hughes's Culture of Complaint has all of the virtues of lively lectures: lucidity, point, wit, humor and a perfect sense of timing. His subject is the current cultural scene of the early 1990's, one that has changed slightly but not essentially. His key targets are political correctness, the nanny state, the privileging of victimology, multiculturalism as mushy relativism rather than openness to the unique contributions of multiple cultures, identity politics and, in the arts a high regard for self-`expression' rather than for skill and talent.The bottom line is that while Hughes is a political liberal he is an intellectual conservative, with a high regard for history, facts and the search for the truth, all of the things whose importance or very possibility the postmodernists downplay or flatly deny. Thus, he is as harsh with sloppy thinking on the left as on the right and he does not hesitate to take firm stands. His special fortes are history and art and he has fascinating and trenchant things to say about both. Just one sample: on a commentator's explaining away some of the extremes of Robert Mapplethorpe--"This, I would say, is the kind of exhausted and literally de-moralized aestheticism that would find no basic difference between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley spectacular, since both, after all, are examples of Art-Deco choreography."A cognate pop culture analogue to Hughes's posture is the voice of the Eagles' Don Henley (no conservative) in "Get Over It": "I'd like to take your inner child and kick its little ass."He does not spend a great deal of time on the origins of what Bloom calls the `school of resentment'; his task is more to explain it and talk about key examples. One key source is the `ed school', which has made a point of discouraging what was once called judicial criticism. Northrop Frye, coming from a very different direction, also warned about evaluative judgments, believing that the history of art resembles the stock market. Stocks rise and fall and it is not our principal task to identify what we, at this moment, perceive as excellent. The ed schools see it differently, I think. They conflate discrimination (making distinctions based on professional knowledge) with discrimination (making prejudiced statements or doing prejudiced things based on ignorance). It is related to their instruction of counselors to avoid being too `directive', i.e. to actually counsel.Hughes sees it quite differently. He believes that it is precisely the historian (and historian of art's) task to make distinctions, to identify purpose, meaning and excellence and expose mediocrity and triviality. The `complaint culture's' response to this is often J. Hillis Miller's--that we should let a thousand flowers bloom (without, presumably, drawing any attention to the flowers' rarity or beauty). The problem is that (in terms of the appearance of books alone) there are about 800,000 flowers each year worldwide and 60,000 or so just in the U.S. The alternative to the sort of discrimination so ably practiced by Hughes is chaos and/or mush (of which he gives some superb examples).This is a delightful, incisive book that now seems old-fashioned. More's the pity.

In his 1990 afterword to The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch explains his purposes in his original book. The common clich&eacute; is that the 60's are the decade of social consciousness and cultural revolution, the 70's the decade of me-ism and political apathy. The Culture of Narcissism was thus seen as a 1970's jeremiad against a culture of self-regarding selfishness.Not so. The book grew out of an earlier study of the family (Haven in a Heartless World) and is concerned with far larger cultural patterns than the transient decade-by-decade changes of the late 20th century. Lasch is concerned with the bureaucratization of both business and life, the surrendering of parental authority to `professionals' who are anxious to justify their existence and reap the benefits of a general cultural and personal dependency. We emerge from the womb too early, our primal feelings being those of loss (of our previous blissful state) and the painful realization of our utter dependency. This leads to both systems of thought and political/cultural programs designed to capitalize on those psychological realities. Rather than come to terms with our limitations and constraints we strive to regain our bliss by indulging our dependency and many stand by to help us with that doomed quest.From that point, Lasch explores multiple aspects of our society, from higher education to sport to paternalism in its many forms, to sex, politics and popular culture. The result is a masterpiece of cultural history and analysis. In the course of the book Lasch is forced to struggle with multiple difficulties. First, cultural history is endlessly complicated and does not yield answers easily. We know that something has happened (SAT scores have gone down despite increased investments in education; western history is no longer required in colleges and universities; sexual hookups are more common, committed relationships more difficult, etc.) but to find precise causes for these realities (if and when they can be identified as realities) is very difficult. Second, human behavior results from human psychology, but `human psychology' is something very much in dispute. Lasch's primary allegiance is to Freud and to many Freud is no longer a psychiatrist but rather a philosopher or poet. Finally, human cultural history subsumes all history. Those who would explicate it must do so with an awareness of human history, science, behavior, art, economics and so on. This is not a task for the weak of heart.The bottom line is that Lasch comes as close as anyone to facing these difficulties and still succeeding in the writing of a significant, persuasive book. Indeed, The Culture of Narcissism is one of the monuments of 20th century social science/cultural history. The book is so rich as to defy easy summary. Two things stand out in particular from the perspective of 2011: a) so much of what he says applies today with equal or greater force; and b) it would be fascinating to see the book rewritten in light of the insights of evolutionary psychology. The humanities have been notably resistant to the neo-Darwinism that marks so much of contemporary social science, a neo-Darwinism that works hand in hand with studies of the human brain enhanced by contemporary instrumentation. My own view is that this work would markedly reinforce Lasch's argument, the resistance to that work indicating the ideology of the vested interests which encourage narcissism as the source of their livelihood.Bottom line: this is a monument in the social sciences. The original publication date--1979--should not deter contemporary readers, who will find its erudition, insight and wisdom a healthy antidote to a culture of therapy that ultimately fails to cure what ails us.

Series 4 is wonderful, but it is particularly enjoyable because the plots are sequential and interlaced. They have always been sequential to some degree, of course, but by now we know all of the characters and can focus on their specific interactions. In other words, the series has become a comic soap opera, not just an exploration of the quirky doc in a quirky locale. The focus is now on the ongoing plot and we want to know what will happen next. The pacing is excellent, the plot twists both interesting and fun and the scripts and acting remain at a very high level. Give us more.

This is a sweet book that many will find interesting and even, at times, inspiring. It recounts some `best practices' utilized by top teachers. It acknowledges that there are no magic bullet solutions, that the process of teaching is complex and that as teachers we must be ever vigilant and ever open to change. It is broken down into 7 chapters, each of which asks a question, e.g., "How do top teachers prepare to teach?" "What do they expect of their students?" "How do they conduct class?" and so on.There are helpful ideas here and a few key ones: e.g. it is very important to not only understand your discipline but to also know the key controversies, historical issues, methodological conflicts, and so on within that discipline. The most important idea in the book: abandon `simple transmittal' ideas of teaching and strive, instead, to create a learning community. Make `student learning' the focus of the class.This is very interesting and, in some ways, cogent. Unfortunately, the book has very little to say about the current state of teaching, the current state of American universities and the administrative challenges to developing a student learning model that could also be evaluated.In my classes, e.g., there is a wide mix of students--students from different schools, students from different majors, students who are freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. I have students who are highly-motivated auditors, students who are taking the class because it fills a requirement, students who are taking the class because it fits their work schedule, students who couldn't enroll in the closed course that they really wanted to take, and so on. I have A students and I have occasional D students, students who are passionate about the material and students who are in college because they feel that they have to be there, in order to secure the kind of job that will enable them to have the things which they desire.At the same time, my state mandates the use of a particular teaching evaluation instrument in addition to my departmental evaluation instrument. Evaluations are utilized in assessing junior faculty for promotion, associate professors for promotion to full professor, post-tenure reviews and for all nominees for the multiple teaching awards available within the university and university system.We have, in short, committed ourselves to a number of things (easily-administered evaluation systems, `access', `diverse populations', `nontraditional students', etc.) that complicate the advice offered by Dr. Bain. We know, for example, that student evaluations are radically flawed. The numbers skew up in small, elective courses, skew down in large, required courses. They do not, by any stretch of the imagination, measure student learning. They encourage `consumerism'.On the other hand, the kind of apparatus which Dr. Bain envisions to actually measure student learning--looking closely at all course materials, sitting in on more than one or two classes, studying student papers and exams to measure the degree of their learning, and so on is simply not `administrable' given the size and complexity of the operation. Each of us can develop a sense of what our students have learned and that is very important; the focus on that learning is very important. Our evaluation systems, department- , college- and campus-wide, however, are very, very crude and they may actually hinder learning, in some important respects. They are, however, fully institutionalized.In the late 60's I taught at West Point. All students, by class, took the same courses; these courses were required; they all had 15 students per section; the students were `sectioned' by merit (i.e. prior performance). Each class was resectioned multiple times in the course of a semester (usually 3 times), so that each instructor knew the level of quality of a class, saw the final work from the previous sectioning period, and could actually assess whether or not the previous sectioning period's instructor had contributed to the student's learning or not. We had a floating instructor so that we were freed up to visit one another's classes on a regular basis. The institution was constantly visited by high school guidance counsellors, senior officers, etc., so that `class visitations' were an everyday occurrence and not disruptive. All of our classes were taught at the same time. In yearling (sophomore) comparative literature (more like `world literature' actually) the classes were all in the early afternoon, right after physical training, hot showers and many-caloried lunches, so that attention spans were more or less even across the 15 sections of the course.We also rotated the preparation of lesson plans for each block of instruction, so that each of us could see the kind of planning that the other instructors were capable of producing. Our rating officer (i.e. the boss) regularly examined papers that we had graded and evaluated our acuity and the quality of our comments. This is the only kind of structure in which evaluation of instruction can be conducted with anything approaching the kind of reliability that I would consider serious.Needless to say, there is nothing in civilian undergraduate education that is remotely like this in 2011. That does not mean that we cannot have superb teaching. My point is that we have already institutionalized a whole host of practices which need to be taken into account when we talk, seriously, about teaching. We begin with existing structures--the results of 40+ years of budgetary/policy decisions; then we can consider significant changes.These wider contexts are almost wholly ignored in Dr. Bain's book. To take but a single point: the vast majority of key (for me, language-centered) education in the regional public institution which most students attend is conducted by contingent faculty. These faculty survive or `fail' based on student evaluations. That fact results in educational practices, some, perhaps many, of which run counter to Dr. Bain's recommendations. I support Dr. Bain's recommendations, at least the great majority of them, but given the academic contexts which we have created they strike me as almost other-worldly.

This book has been both celebrated and damned. The Amazon reviews proved to be very helpful to me, since they led me to other commentaries on the book, commentaries which helped to put the book in perspective.The authors have been subjected to virulent ad hominem attacks for their efforts, while others have proclaimed the book to be of inestimable importance. The subject--IQ and its ramifications--is highly flammable, of course, and has resulted in some outraged charges which are so extreme that one is surprised and perhaps gratified to see that they are easily countered by simple references to the text.The authors are at pains (nearly 900 pp., with elaborate scholarly apparatus) to press home the results of their research. The overriding bottom line is that IQ is very important in our lives. High intelligence correlates with a large number of `successes' in life and low intelligence correlates with a great deal of dysfunctionality. In many cases we expect the behaviors under examination to correlate more highly and more directly with other factors--socioeconomic status, e.g.--but the higher and more direct correlations are with IQ.We know that IQ is a result of both genetics and environment and the specific levels of influence continue to elude us. Obviously, the notion that genetics are very important and that mankind is far less malleable than we would like would be a particularly flammable conclusion, since it runs counter to generations of public policy, to specific political ideologies and, ultimately, to specific conceptions of the nature of man. The authors do not push this view, because they do not assert the `balance' between heredity and environment (which is now undecidable), but their success in demonstrating the thoroughgoing importance of IQ in human behavior and their reminding us of its heredibility has lead some to overreact to the book, seeing it as some sort of right-wing, racist tract.Commentators who I find rational and fair argue that much of the social science in the book is quite straightforward, quite established and largely above challenge. Writers on IQ are often reticent individuals, because they undergo constant attack. Hence, we have a situation in which the science is more or less settled, but not talked about very much with general audiences because of the heat generated. Thus, Herrnstein and Murray are, in a sense, performing a public service by discussing, at length, the results of modern studies of human intelligence.The devil, of course, resides within the details, which is to say, the implications seen upon examination of the science and the sorts of public policies that might be developed to both ameliorate society and the conditions of the individuals who constitute it. These parts of the book are less `settled' than the science, though it is very important to raise the issues so that they might be discussed dispassionately and solutions to problems be sought and found.The most important response to the book that I have seen is Thomas Sowell's review ("Ethnicity and IQ") in The American Spectator. Sowell confirms the value of the `science portion' of the book and treats the authors and their arguments (and speculations) with scholarly respect. At the same time, he raises cogent exceptions to important portions of their argument. He agrees with the authors that the `cultural bias' of tests has been overstressed in some respects. The `bias', if you will, does not come so much in experiential and linguistic items as it does in more abstract questions. Individuals outside of the cultural mainstream tend to do poorly on the more abstract sections of standardized tests. This is not just true of individuals of African descent, but also of a whole host of individuals of European descent. (One of the strengths of Sowell's writing is the fact that he draws on the entire globe whenever he talks about issues of race and ethnicity.)Even more important is the fact that as individuals become part of the cultural mainstream their test scores can rise dramatically. The crucial example concerns Russian Jews at the time of the first world war. Their scores were extremely low, so low as to make individuals doubt the validity of the tests. Now, Jews tend to score in the upper reaches of intelligence tests. Herein lies the core of Sowell's argument. He does not see the Jews' low scores as oddities to be dismissed. He sees them as authentic results, results which, eventually, became subject to dramatic change. Thus, he argues for the possibility of radical improvement in IQ, over time, something of which Herrnstein and Murray are more sceptical.I had wanted to read The Bell Curve for some time and while impressed with the erudition of the authors and the labours involved in the book's creation, I found it a somewhat ponderous read. The problem, of course, is that they are treading dangerous ground throughout and are forced to be cautious, conservative and extremely detailed in their arguments and adducing of evidence. For me (neither a psychologist, sociologist nor a statistician) this was a bit too much social science and a few too many standard deviations. This was not so much their fault as it was mine. They include in the book a mini- crash-course in statistics (Appendix I), for example. Their argument is not opaque; there is simply a lot of it.I found that I much preferred Murray's books Real Education and the most recent, Coming Apart. The social science evidence is always crucial, of course, but the analysis and policy implications are more center-stage in those books and, thus, more accessible for the general reader. Nevertheless, The Bell Curve remains a very important, controversial book. We need not fear it, nor malign it. We simply need to consider it at length and welcome multiple scholarly voices in examining the important issues which it raises (which is, finally, the authors' core intention).

Each of the Bolitar novels is something special, but this one is special indeed. It combines the elements of all of the novels--a fascinating plot, top characters, and a fine sense of place--with an extended meditation on the nature and responsibilities of fatherhood. It is not a mainstream novel with incidental mystery/suspense elements; it is a full-tilt genre piece with superb thematic elements. It is also especially rich in its discrete paragraphs. Coben shoots for great one-liners and often achieves them. In this novel, however, he is forced to extend his thoughts an extra sentence or two and the results are impressive. I think particularly of a passage on grief and the perpetual stoop that follows it . . . and the smile that never quite makes it into the eyes. This is the kind of passage that you put in front of students as you tell them that the mainstream novelists may sometimes achieve passages such as that but that very, very few of them could create the plots and characters and settings that are the genre writer's stock in trade.

Powerful story, fine art, an intriguing mix of stories within stories. Basically we have a set of back stories illuminating the lives of the heroes, mixed with intercut 'documents' and an overarching narrative concerning a putative plot to eliminate the heroes so that some grand, dark event can occur without their interference. To summarize would be to spoil. Suffice to say, that all of the narrative lines converge, an event occurs and the aftermath becomes the subject of controversial reflection. As the main narrative proceeds, a second narrative parallels it (from a comic book read by a young bystander within the principal narrative). The interplay between these two narratives is central to the final resolution, in my opinion, but I can't describe it without spoiling the principal narrative. The architectonics of the plots are very impressive and engaging, though the greatest amount of attention is likely to be focused upon the aftermath of the 'event' and the degree to which one 'agrees' with it. Highly recommended. This is the graphic novel as true art.

An English family moves into a castle, a setting in which the writer/father believes he can write masterpieces. He doesn't. Instead he buries his wife and develops writer's block. His second wife does what she can to nurture the writer's children--a bright, clever young man (cf. the youngest sister, Margaret, in Sense and Sensibility) and two older sisters, both marriageable, one pretty but initially superficial, the other deeper but slightly less attractive.Enter the inheritor of the castle (the writer's new landlord) and his brother, each of whom might (or might not) be a match for one of the writer's daughters. The brothers, however, are American, which is to say rich, slightly intimidated by all things British and a bit thick. When Henry James does the Americans-in-Europe bit it often turns nasty. When Jane Austen does the marriageable sisters bit it often turns out well. In I Capture the Castle the two different plot models come together somewhat uneasily. I should say also that the British actors outshine the American actors to a noticeable degree.The story is engaging and the younger of the two daughters (whose story this is, ultimately) is sweet, charming and worthy of either Jane Austen or Henry James.The location shots in Wales and the Isle of Man are very nice. Recommended for all devotees of British period drama.

Crais's L.A. REQUIEM was well-received, though I had reservations about his decision to show a side of Joe Pike which ultimately weakened his force as Elvis' nearly invincible, shadowy partner, a character I call the avenging angel and compare with figures such as Parker's Hawk and Lehane's Bubba.Since then Crais has written two freestanding novels, DEMOLITION ANGEL (which had a huge movie sale and of which we're likely to hear more) and HOSTAGE. HOSTAGE is pure power plot. The elements are thrown into the cauldron (SWAT burnout, vulnerable family, drifter defectives, the mob) and the relentless chemical reaction follows.HOSTAGE gives new meaning to the term 'page-turner'; it's a page ripper. Its only competition is every book by Lee Child. I would give Child the nod at this point, since HOSTAGE is so light on character and setting. The dramatis personae are all very familiar and there is relatively little narrative texture to impede (but also enrich) the plot.Child is the master of this form and Jack Reacher is a more interesting and unusual (without being weird) character than Jeff Talley. He also takes us to a host of interesting places. But thank the lord; you can read both of these skilled writers, each of whom is at the top of his game.

First off, the movie is different from the Dan Jenkins novel. It is far more textured and layered. The send-up of Est training is hilarious. This is not so much a movie about football as it is a love story with a strong subtext satirizing self-help movements (including Pyramid Power). The dialogue is memorable and Preston's performance would have garnered an academy award if the movie had been perceived as serious and weighty. It IS serious and weighty, but it is done with a light, humorous touch. I have watched this movie at least 20 times and never tire of it. The reason: the performances, of course, but the one-liners are priceless. This is the best introduction to the pantheon of Jenkins characters populating his Ft. Worth-centered novels, with a young Brian Dennehy doing a star turn as T. J. Lambert. If you don't know the novels, you've got a great set of treats ahead of you. In this case the movie is better than the book. Baja Oklahoma was also made into a movie--worth seeing, but not quite as good as the book.

Night and Day gives us Jesse in a personal mood. All of the Jesse Stone novels do, to some degree, but this one does so with special emphasis. Jesse is involved with his former wife Jenn in an ongoing, self-destructive relationship. In Night and Day she has taken a job in New York that involves a live-in arrangement with her producer. Jesse pines, but finds solace in the company of Sunny Randall, Rita Fiore and his shrink, Dix. Meanwhile he is dealing with two cases--one in which a school principal has invaded the privacy of her female charges by inspecting their undergarments and a second in which the town of Paradise is dealing with a peeper who assumes the name of the Night Hawk and escalates his activities to include home invasions. These involve the photographing of women but the violence remains psychological and not (yet) physical. In short, Jesse must deal with a succession of sex and gender issues at the same time that he is trying to sort out his own. I don't want to spoil the ending, but suffice to say that it is satisfying and that all of the problems are (for now at least) resolved.A special pleasure in the Jesse Stone novels results from the fact that the film adaptations have been so successful. I now hear Tom Selleck's voice speaking Jesse's lines and the results are dead-on effective. Jesse is an attractive character; we welcome the chance to learn more about his personal experiences and travails and Night and Day satisfies our curiosity nicely. Highly recommended.

This is a fine film, worthy of the book that preceded it. (If you don't know the Kenzie/Gennaro books that Dennis Lehane penned before he focused exclusively on standalones, discover them now. They're terrific.) Affleck's direction is excellent. The high points: the Dorchester feel, the use of local, non-professional, actors (and, hence, brilliant casting); the pitch-perfect accents; and last but certainly not least--Casey Affleck's award-level performance.The plot exudes and sustains a great deal of tension, but it is in no way claustrophobic. The ending comes in stages. This gives the plot a different type of rhythm, as the layers are removed. Only one slight cavil--Bubba is the most memorable character in the Kenzie/Gennaro books--an invincible earth scorcher who, fortunately, likes Patrick and Angie. He plays Hawk to their Spenser or Joe Pike to their Elvis Cole. We should know more about him in the film, so we can place him in proper context. The actor who plays him should also be much larger in physical stature, much kinder/gentler with regard to Patrick and Angie and far more menacing with regard to the bad guys. This was a missed opportunity.Let's hope this becomes a franchise.

The director's cut adds approximately 45 minutes to the film--a landmark documentary with Martin Scorcese showing his chops as a film editor and Michael Wadleigh lovingly retooling his masterpiece. The 'times' are evoked with precision, humor and objectivity. This is not a pure gush. The balance between music and interviews/commentary/vignettes is approximately 60/40, with standout performances from The Who, Joan Baez, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Ten Years After, Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, et al. It is not a 'greatest hits' compilation, since some of the greatest hits did not yet exist, but the editing, the split screen images and the atmospherics are superb. This is not an ode to hippiedom, though some might see it as that. It is a beautifully shot, loving documentary, with the love bestowed on the music and the strange attractions of human behavior.

First, don't trust any of the written descriptions. There is no glossary of Greasemanisms in the book and nothing about Doug Tracht's time with the Village People. What there is is a long succession of jokes, hung on the narrative thread of a putative autobiography. Where Howard Stern simply expresses his own personality--that of a superego-less adolescent who might say anything (over the air) that comes into his mind, Doug Tracht constructed a persona through which he consistently speaks. The persona has a history with which his fans are familiar, a private vocabulary (which his fans all understand) and the ability to sustain extended stories with the persona as protagonist. The stories prove to be jokes. Some end with the inevitability of a stripshow comedian's and some (usually the best) end with a shaggy dog story's flat cleverness. This book is for dedicated fans who can hear the tones of the Greaseman's voice and construct the cadences of the stories and punch lines in their heads. Those who have never heard him on the radio will see the book as little more than a series of middling-quality jokes. As in real life, it's all in the timing and delivery. While Tracht's career has had its ups and downs (after a long period in Washington, a brief sojourn in L.A., a return to Washington and now--in his late 50's--a return to one of his earliest markets, Jacksonville, he has stayed with his Greaseman shtick and is riding it into the sunset.

Elmore Leonard is never a discovery; he's the master, but this book was hiding in a bin I hadn't been through in awhile and the moment I found it I devoured it. This is classic Leonard--lean, Hemingwayesque, beautifully plotted and clear as crystal. A Detroit process server stumbles onto a strange case and finds himself trapped by an array of dangerous individuals: a scam artist with a Louisiana hit man/sidekick, two local black criminals, the dead partner of one of them and his alcoholic ex-wife. The process server, Jack Ryan, walks the tightrope, dodging shotgun blasts, getting cozy with the ex-wife and finding some help from a local cop named Dick Speed. This is pure Leonard genre heaven, but without the Damon Runyon clumsy figures. These people are all serious. It's the difference between Killshot and Get Shorty--Leonard in his ultra-serious mode, doing what only he can do so well. It's a lightning-fast read, dated only by the dollar amounts in play. Highly recommended.

This is a very important book. Gross and Levitt are, respectively, scientists trained in biology and mathematics. They are also broadly-educated individuals who are able to deal with postmodern (and other) challenges to science on those challenges' terms. They have done considerable homework in preparing to write this book and some of their analyses of postmodern thought are among the most astute and crisp that I have seen. Moreover, the book is eminently readable. The style is firm but graceful. Reading it is not only a pleasure in itself, but a reaffirmation of the possibilities and benefits of broad liberal arts education. While the issues are current ones, the authorial voice is one of 'old school' erudition informed by deep humanity.There is a danger that the book could be considered a polemic since its rhetoric is very direct. Punches are not pulled; euphemisms are not substituted. Nevertheless, while the book provides the pleasures offered by a great polemic it still enjoys the weight and point of serious argument. It makes its scholarly case.This is must reading for all who work in the humanities and social sciences and seek to understand the assaults to which science has been subjected as well as those assaults' etiology. The continual question that haunts everyone confronting postmodern thought is, how can serious people believe such stuff? This book provides a number of plausible answers to that question.

This excellent collection of essays includes pieces from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Divided into three sections, "Sociology and its Fate," "Marxism and After," and "Thought in its Setting," it includes such important essays as "An End to Sociology?" and "Students, Professors and Philosopher Kings," a nearly monograph-long reflection on the contemporary (i.e. 1973) university.The essays are often written at a high level of abstraction. This is a book for colleagues rather than for the general public, though its subjects are of broad interest. In spite of many contemporary stereotypes, this book reminds us that academicians can be of the left but conservative in their expectations and standards. While Birnbaum is welcoming to radical thought he subjects it to serious analysis and he upholds standards of discipline, rigor and the importance of high culture. Some would now call that 'elitism' but serious education and serious thought are elite activities. They deserve our strongest efforts.For those not familiar with Birnbaum's writings, one of their hallmarks is his deep familiarity with European thought, politics, history and social models. This serves him very well in these particular pieces.Highly recommended.

This is a masterpiece of social commentary. Not quite serious sociology replete with regression analysis, but much more than pop history and culture, Bobos in Paradise is a serious meditation on the manner in which the disparate worlds of the 1960's and 1980's have merged, as the radicals of the former have merged with the entrepreneurs of the latter.Bobos are bourgeois bohemians, though I suppose they could also be bohemian bourgeois. Jerry Rubin famously went from the activist trenches to the world of the investor. The Clintons went from the world of the antiwar movement to the world of the futures trader. While he mentions exemplary cases such as this, Brooks is interested in something far more subtle. By turns humorous, silly and hypocritical, the decisions made by Bobos can also be seen as pleasantly moderate and, in their own way, disciplined and responsible.Bobos still resist authority but they make exceptions for, e.g., the health of the body. They will not be bothered by activities that would have riled Victorians--women jogging in little more than spandex underwear--so long as they are doing so in an effort to better themselves and preserve their youth and health. They do not countenance materialism that goes beyond the necessary (the purchase of luxury yachts, e.g.) but they are quite prepared to spend tens of thousands of dollars for a double oven with a six-burner cook surface. Gold faucet taps would disgust them but natural-surface slate showers they would see as de riguer. Where the sixties' radicals sometimes confined themselves to a diet that could be purchased by a third world peasant's wages, the Bobos shop at Whole Foods.Brooks charts their patterns of consumption, their business and intellectual lives, their views of pleasure, their politics and their spirituality. The writing is simply beautiful, the examples by turns hilarious and touching. The book is more readable than any book with its range of reference and seriousness of purpose that I can recall. (It has also sparked a sequel: On Paradise Drive.)Bobos in Paradise should be paired with Charles Murray's Coming Apart. Both deal with the ways in which educated elites have separated themselves from the poor and both show the ways in which the extremes of the sixties have been transcended by elites while they have nearly destroyed the lives of the poor.Highly recommended.

First, the warning that this is not so much a novel as a collection of stories stitched into a novel. But don't hesitate. It still works; the seams are barely noticeable and you'll continue to read it straight through, despite the fact that it's constructed of separable parts.All of the trademark Block elements are in play: economical prose, salient details, clever, no-tricks plotting, and interesting characters. The latter are particularly important, given the moral stakes, but as many have noted Block is able to write sympathetically about a professional assassin without compromising the complexity of the world in which he lives, moves, has his being, and collects his stamps.Block always seems to write effortlessly, even when constructing a world of such great moral ambiguity. That's why they call him a master.

I have already gone on record with the judgment that Foyle's War is the premier British detective series. It is not really fair to call Frost a close second, because the tone, atmospherics and intent are quite different. Frost is superb. A Detective Inspector in the fictional town of Denton (we know that it is in the Thames Valley), Jack Frost faces the grittier realities of modern Britain. A crusty widower, who is alienated from the 'new' ways and the managerial superintendent who embodies them, Frost is a classic noir hero. Tough but with a core of sweetness, he expresses his love carefully, metering it out like a coin-fed British heater. He is always eating and never seems to suffer from his comfort-food excesses. Sir David Jason nails the performance. Though he never represented the Frost envisioned by the character's creator, his performances are consistently excellent. Across the series, he utilizes a series of assistants, all of whom contribute to the general effect, with George, his Detective Sergeant, appearing regularly. The series is very British in its culture, but that culture is the culture of the street, not that of theme-park Britain. The writing, the direction, the plot arcs and the performances are always of a very high order. This is great entertainment; it is also entertainment that regularly approaches serious drama and serious art. Don't miss it.

P. D. James's stories are all nicely textured, with carefully-layered plotting and interesting characters. In this story we have a crime novelist who is found dead, his hands severed from his body. The suspects have alibis; one (a slightly effete and decidedly obnoxious critic) is played by the superb Bill Nighy. There are two subplots, one involving a sleazoid gangster, the second involving Dalgleish and his relationship with his girl friend. As those subplots intersect, the girl friend is threatened. The climax is particularly memorable, with a storm at sea and Dalgleish trapped with a suspect in a seaside cottage through which the winds are howling and in which the water is rising. This is definitely worth a look, if only for the Nighy character.

Actually 4 and a half stars.What it is not is what the title implies: a culture-war polemic. This is a heavily theorized account of the state of higher education. Moving from Kant, though the German Idealists and Humboldt, Readings traces the notion of a university anchored in rationality to one anchored in culture, in particular the culture of the nation-state, which the university is to inculcate in its students. In Germany this happens through philosophy, in England through English literature. Now, with the decline of the nation-state because of the triumph of transnational capitalism, there is, in effect, no nation state with a culture to inculcate. Hence, we have the university of `excellence', a nonreferential term that can mean anything.Since this `excellence' subsumes everything previously considered counter-cultural, it turns all to a marketable commodity. (You want radical professors? You want radical cultural studies? Come to Old Siwash. Ours are Excellent. Just like our excellent dormitories and excellent exercise facilities.)Ultimately this is an assault on the technocratic/bureaucratized/commercialized modern university, which measures all with quantifiable `metrics', accountability always being equatable with accounting, but what Readings offers in its place is somewhat vague, highly theoretical, unintelligible to bureaucrats and unlikely to ever happen: a community of `dissensus' rather than a search (as with the Germans) for not just the truth but its underlying unity.The book is very provocative, deeply-considered and interesting. It is fair to say that it is most heavily tilted toward the German side of things rather than the English side of things (American higher education having been heavily influenced by both). It is also, as he acknowledges, heavily tilted toward the humanities. Life is very different in the physical sciences and engineering, e.g., though much of what he says with regard to `excellence' is applicable to the ethos of professional schools.It is written from a leftist perspective. He is contemptuous of the arguments of all conservatives as well as actual liberals, such as Hirsch, and trivializes their arguments. He assumes, e.g., that core curricula are dead, never to return, that the historical method in the humanities is largely dead, never to return in anything like its former state, that black studies, women's studies, cultural studies, etc. are all a priori good, that the entry into the professoriate of individuals dodging the draft was a good thing and that high theory is a `project' decidedly worth pursuing. In other words, the book is very much of the 1980's and 1990's. What is interesting about Readings' critique is the fact that he acknowledges that multiculturalism and postmodernism have helped to create the `university of excellence'. They are causes as well as symptoms.There are many things which he does not consider: e.g. the growth in student populations and the changes in student demographics. Was the curriculum demolished because the `new students' couldn't handle it? Or didn't want it? He notes that student passivity results from their feeling `parked'; they are not being educated; they are being self-accredited through the collection of credits and the meeting of requirements. But what is the etiology of that? Global capitalism? Universities hungry for tuition revenue? Antinomian faculty? The belief that all should go to college (for professional advancement), but a consequent dumbing down of elementary, secondary, undergraduate and graduate education? Many more now `go to college', but the credentials for professional advancement have been ratcheted up as the requirements for professional credentials have been ratcheted down. Students don't just feel `parked'; they actually have been parked. His theory is very subtle and thoughtful, his historiography less so.All in all, this is a very interesting book. Tragically, Readings died in a plane crash just before it was completed. I wish he had survived and had decades more of experience with the `university of excellence' so that he could write complementary books on the subject.

I expected much more. Great music, great cast and a tried and true premise: rock 'n roll versus the forces of prudishness, control and fuddy-duddyness (particularly when the latter is embodied by Kenneth Branagh, looking like Hitler-as-cabinet minister). The film's flaw is a weak script with crude sex jokes, crude situations and the failure to fully utilize the talent at hand. The scenes on the ship grow claustrophobic and the film loses the energy that the cast and premise lead the audience to expect. I still love Hoffman and Nighy. Unfortunately, this was not their best vehicle.

This is a very nice departure for Elmore Leonard. The master of noir and the Runyonesque dramedy, he is also one of our top writers of westerns. In this novel he appropriates many aspects of the western to create a 30's period novel. These are the hardscrabble 30's, with elements of the depression and dustbowl sitting cheek by jowl with the exploits of the likes of Baby Face Nelson. The period details are exquisite--as finely etched as the lineaments of his characters.We are, quintessentially, in the world of genre fiction, with predictable characters--marshals and molls--inevitable results, and a string of laconic apercus along the way. Very few can do this with the steady hand and light touch of a writer like Leonard and no one but Leonard can sustain focus and the reader's attention while sketching a narrative that is unhurried and episodic.Leonard's sense of place is always impressive, whether that place be Miami, Los Angeles, or his native Detroit. Here the master does Tulsa and Kansas City. Enjoy and learn.

This is the one, the master's masterpiece. The story is heart-wrenching in its sad inevitability; the characters are unforgettable, the style honed to perfection. It also represents the perfect realization of the vision for noir fiction which Chandler articulated in "The Simple Art of Murder." Marlowe is as noble as it gets in a decidedly ignoble world and few of the other characters deserve to be on stage with him. The setting is palpable. You taste the smog and feel it against your skin, just as you taste the gimlets at Victor's. This is the writer's guidebook and the greatest pain comes from the fact that Chandler makes it look so easy. This is exhibit A for the art of writing. It's not using strange words. It's using everyday words in new ways. Here he does it on nearly every page.

So why can't we give 6 stars? If any album deserves it, this one does. I'm not a great fan of contemporary music, but the other morning I turned on a radio show and suddenly a song came on. My immediate response was, "Finally there's a band out there that I could enjoy." The song ended and I discovered that the song, "Perfect Stranger," was from ROCKFORD. I shoulda known. As a Cheap Trick fan in Madison, Milwaukee, and points south in the 70's I was headed back to the future.How good is ROCKFORD? It's so good that the praise that it's receiving radically understates the case. This is more than a great Cheap Trick record; it's a virtual tour of all that was exceptional in the music of the 70's. Nearly every song includes a reference to the music of that period. It would be fun to play it in bits and pieces and have people guess as to what they're actually hearing. The Beatles, ELO, you name it, it's here. There are touches of Supertramp, the Moody Blues, and a number of bands with which Cheap Trick is seldom associated.Every track is strong. At least 5 of the tracks are truly exceptional and 1 or 2 could be considered instant classics. Most important of all, each is different. It is sad to see some of my old time idols making records in which nearly every track sounds the same. I know, I know, there are differences, but contrast TWO AGAINST NATURE with GAUCHO or AJA. With ROCKFORD we're looking at a major release and one that never, no never, disappoints.

THE HORSE LATITUDES (with the accompanying explanation) was one of the best crime titles since THE BIG SLEEP and I, THE JURY. FLINCH is Ferrigno's best novel since his smash debut. A brother vs. brother book, the setting is Babylon, California-style and Babylon is crowded. In addition to the brothers Gage there is a rich mix of subsidiary characters--nearly an ensemble cast--and the narration cuts between individuals and individual time levels, first revealing enormities and then depicting them in detail.The texture is dense and neatly-layered, the plot rhythms are perfect and the triple-climax conclusion is pure genre gold--all in all a lovely mix of pain and pleasure, tears and laughter, instruction and entertainment. This is the Sodom and Gomorrah Express, with all the right stops along the way and a satisfying conclusion.Like Ellroy, the farther Ferrigno gets from Southern California, the greater his capacity for nailing it. This is an up to date cultural tour as well as prime crime fiction.

The Amazon reviewers have been very favorably disposed toward Luther, the Netflix reviewers much less so. I believe that the series is worthy of attention but that it has some significant flaws.The concept. In a special feature on the second disc of the first season's episodes the production team spells out its concept, a concept that is quite muddled. The hero is to be a mix of the two classic protagonists (the puzzle solver--Holmes, Miss Marple and the loner riddled with angst--Philip Marlowe). The dyad envisioned is actually the English mystery versus the American hardboiled crime story and the distinction here is vague. Holmes, after all, is troubled ("Watson, the needle!") and the hardboiled Spenser is at great peace, in a committed relationship, fondling his girlfriend's dog and sipping Riesling (most recently). Marlowe himself is a loner, but his most distinctive trait (as Chandler sketches in "The Simple Art of Murder") is that he is a man of honor in all things. John Luther is not really an original character and the fact that he represents an amalgam is not new. One need look no further than Robbie Coltrane's masterful Fitz in the Cracker series: a psychologist/sleuth with a great ability to understand human behavior and solve crime puzzles who, at the same time, has troubled relationships as well as a significant problem with gambling and drink.The crew also suggests that Luther is something of a superhero, in that he only wears one set of clothes. The latter is true (one set of clothes), but Peter Parker, Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent and others have (obviously, I'm afraid) multiple sets of clothes and one superhero uniform.The situation. According to the production crew, DCI Luther is caught amid three relationships with women. Each makes special, different demands on him and he bounces among them like a harried pinball. The women are conceived archetypally, with archetypal labels: the virgin (a psychopathic killer, played very nicely by Ruth Wilson); the mother (Luther's ex-wife played by Indira Varma) and the crone (Luther's boss, a detective superintendent played by Saskia Reeves). The team admits that DSU Rose Teller is not really a crone, overlooking the fact that Mrs. Luther is childless and the psychopathic Ms. Morgan's sexual history is actually unspecified.The more accurate take is that by Ruth Wilson, who plays the psychopath. She opines that Luther is a reversed Silence of the Lambs, with a male detective turning to a younger, female psychopath for help. Actually, the more proximate example is the current Chelsea Cain series in which a sadistic psychopath tortures a detective and the two end up developing a haunting, psychologically-intimate relationship.The setting is London, the palette fairly bland with grays, greens and browns and an occasional splash of red. This is accurate. The production values are strong, the look somewhere between `gritty' and `realist'. The police headquarters is in Southwark. There is little of Baedeker Britain or theme park London aside from an occasional shot.The story lines are dark, darker than 95% of British dramas. For example, one episode concerns the owner of a horror/killer museum store who abducts women, locks them in a small, cramped box, freezes their bodies, drains their blood and uses that blood as ink to write ravings on walls.The acting is good. The standout is Ruth Wilson as the psychopath Helen Morgan. I also have a soft spot for Luther's sidekick DS Ripley, played very nicely by Warren Browne. Idris Elba is a superb actor, of course, but he seems much more assured (to me) as Stringer Bell in The Wire than as DCI John Luther. As Luther he relies on several looks and postures and repeats them endlessly. The ponderous Luther breaks eye contact and rubs his hand over his face, concealing some of its features. He also contorts his body (revealing his comparable psychological state) in uncomfortable ways. The performances are disappointing only in that the expectations with regard to this very special actor are so high.Bottom line: an interesting and engaging series that is not quite as original or high concept as it purports to be, with very dark story lines and solid but not flawless acting. The episodes involve individual cases, but there is an ongoing exploration of Luther's personal life. It is essential that the episodes be seen in sequence. And be warned (SPOILER): the writer is not above killing off a key cast member or revealing horrid flaws in characters we have come to trust.

The co-producers of Life were whipsawed by the writers' strike and there was some doubt as to whether or not NBC would pick them up for a third season. As it turned out, they didn't. The problem: whether or not to resolve Charlie's search for the people who framed him and the reasons why they did it. The production team decided to resolve that story in the second season. Bless them for doing so. The episodes of season two are all superb and the cast changes (Crews and Reese now being supervised by a former NYPD captain rather than a now-demoted LAPD lieutenant) work well. The final episode, "One," resolves the key issues without foreclosing the possibility of a third season. In fact, the final episode has no 'A story'--the murder of the week, with Crews's private quest hanging in the background. "One" focuses entirely on the private quest and Crews must assemble all of the people and strengths that he can to solve the crime perpetrated against him and protect those for whom he cares. It is very, very satisfying.So here's what you do: watch all of the episodes of seasons one and two, take delight in the final episode and join us in petitioning appropriate networks to consider bringing back Life. This is television drama at its smartest and most entertaining. And if not a new season, how about a Life feature film?

It could just as easily have been 1 star. This is a kitsch classic. I saw it on a tiny tv when I was six or seven years old and found it riveting and scary as all get out. Now it's pure cheese and corn, with interminable phony fight scenes, unending car chases along the same roads and predictably-solved cliffhanger endings. And yet, it's so bad that it's good. It's campy, quaint fun, and for less than ten bucks a lot of entertainment (since it runs for over 5 hours). The renowned detective, Craig Kennedy, is, by turns, thick as a brick and smarter than Sherlock Holmes (particularly in his final explanation of the case). He is a specialist in disguises and, given his doofus antagonists, the same disguises continue to work, even after he's been exposed using them. The Clutching Hand himself (described as Craig Kennedy's arch-enemy) has the most fiendish of cackles, which he lets loose at inopportune moments. The serial has the kind of cast that Johnny Carson (as teatime movie host, Art Fern) used to describe and the clips that Johnny/Art showed could have come straight out of the fight scenes here. The plot is endless. I've seen reference to a 70 minute feature version. The editor would have had little trouble in reducing the 15 20-minute episodes down to a short feature. Having said all that, it's still great fun. I could imagine a well-oiled fraternity party in the wee hours, with the members stamping their feet and saying, "One more episode, one more episode . . . " The scenes of mid-30's L.A. are worth the price of admission, as is the use of television as the villain and crimestopper's cutting-edge technology. Many of the actors are from the silent screen days. As such, they specialize in long reaction shots and big-eyed leers. This one's delicious.

I am a great fan of Joyce Maynard's memoir, At Home in the World, and I also recommend her new book, Internal Combustion. Its genre is romantic true crime, not romantic in the 'romance' sense but in the sense of high romanticism. As I have said before, Joyce Maynard understands the world by understanding herself and--in this book--she comes to understand aspects of herself by understanding the experience of the Seamans. The ongoing question within the book (she tells us) is not only why Nancy Seaman killed Bob Seaman but why Joyce Maynard was so attracted to the case that she ended up devoting so much time and energy to it.She ultimately answers both questions, seeing patterns of behavior in the Seaman case that echo patterns of behavior in her own. Maintaining this balance is the key to the book's success. The problem with romanticism or at least the potential problem with it has always been that it tilts toward the unique and even the ineffable, sacrificing the universal. In reacting against the eighteenth-century's fascination with the commonalities in our experience romanticism risked an obsession with those commonalities' opposite. Hence the risk that it can become recondite to the point of incomprehensible or, in some cases, simply weird. The true trick--for the eighteenth century--was to observe the unique closely and then see, within it, the general. The purely unique, the truly unique, is ultimately not very interesting, because it fails to mesh with our own experience.I think the most interesting aspect of Internal Combustion is not the principal text--the overlap between Joyce Maynard's divorce behaviors and the parallel disfunctions in the Seaman household. The interesting thing is that there is such overlap at the same time that there are such differences. The Seaman family is incapable of communicating, in part because of the fact that the men are, essentially, engineers who communicate in different ways. Joyce Maynard, on the other hand, is a highly skilled communicator, one who grew up in an artistic family, the antithesis, in many ways, of the Seaman family. As we read the Seaman saga we can see how more effective, more human forms of communication might have helped save them. But would they have? Joyce Maynard succumbed to some of the same human realities and temptations as the Seamans, despite her superior verbal and listening skills.Hence the real subtext: our common piety that problems could be solved if only we could communicate (in marriage, in global politics, whatever) is, in a sense, belied by the far more powerful dictates of common human reality, what the traditionalists would term human nature. The postmodernists are fond of denying the existence of the latter, but the experience of the Seamans (with Bob's head struck repeatedly by a hatchet) and of Joyce Maynard, pouring wine over her head or threatening to jump out of a moving vehicle, offer compelling evidence of its existence. Seeing the 'only communicate' piety belied may be disquieting, but that's what makes this a true 'true crime' book and not a self-help or 'inspirational' one.Bravo, Joyce. And for those of you who haven't read At Home in the World, what are you waiting for?

George Gently is a stiff-upper-lip honest cop who makes his more corrupt fellow officers nervous. He is paired with a Dirty Harry-in-training younger sergeant who likes to bend rules in order to close cases. They move from oil-and-water to something like Dutch Uncle-and-adult-in-process to surrogate father and son. The original books covered ground from the 50's to the 80's; here we are focused on the 60's and for me at least the period setting is only about 85% authentic. Nevertheless, the acting is superb and the scripts excellent. This is hard-boiled, British-style. We're not in Midsomer with kindly vicars with dark secrets. This is recalcitrant realityville and very much worth a look.

This is not West, Q.C. in the mode of the John Thall series. Helen West is a prosecuting attorney, but this is not courtroom drama. The protagonist is involved with a police detective and, as we first meet her, is in surgery for the removal of an ovarian cyst. She is pulled in multiple directions, both in her personal and professional life, but still manages to become involved in cases whose nature evolves across a complex set of plot lines. This is adult material, but not adult in the pornographic sense. The sexual material is explicitly inferred rather than explictly rendered. The characters are interesting and multi-dimensional, the ethos gritty but not overwhelmingly so. The supporting cast is exceptional, with Anthony Howell of Foyle's War fame, Nicholas Woodeson from Rome, Foyle's War, and other productions and Conor Mullen as Chief Superintendent Bailey, Helen West's lover. Amanda Burton is effective in the title role, but the plots are broad and deep and West is only one of many important characters in the stories' plot arcs. Strong production values, good direction, but, unfortunately, no subtitles. Turn up the volume if you want to hear all of the words and have half a chance of understanding them. Highly recommended.

This is both a scholarly and personal account of the much-discussed rise in college costs. The author is an economist, one of whose specialties is higher education. He has served as a senior administrator and (for a considerable period) faculty member at Cornell. Hence, his general observations and conclusions are complemented by more detailed accounts of the procedures in place at his home institution.This is a useful way of proceeding, for universities are not anxious to share the specific details of their budgets and do not often explain the private negotiations (or maneuvers) that serve as the backdrop for their public actions.The book is conservative in the sense that it is largely accepting of `the way things are', though it offers suggestions for efficiencies or more rational ways of proceeding at the margins. The principal cause of the rise in college costs is the academic `arms race' in which the top universities compete with one another for the best faculty, the best students, the best programs and the best facilities. That competition drives up costs. It is aided by certain forms of federal support, by plentiful endowments, dramatic developments in information technology, increased student applications and conscious policies (need-blind admissions, e.g.). The federal government is a player here, of course, with increased regulation, reduced coverage of indirect costs, Title IX and the prohibition of fixed retirement ages.If one wants a general account of what has transpired since the early 70's, with some interesting details with regard to Cornell, this is a fine book. The author is aware, of course, that he is only describing a tiny subset of U.S. higher education, but it is that subset which often draws the most attention.He does not address sensitive political issues and he does not address the common elements (which contribute to the rise of costs) across the spectrum of private institutions (though he does give some attention to public education, particularly those elements of public education which offer competition to the upper tier of institutions). There are many, many things which exist on college campuses which did not exist there in the 1950's or 1960's. Are they necessary? If not necessary, should they be high priorities? Would students/parents opt for them if given a choice?There is virtually nothing on for-profit higher education, which avoids many of the costs that campuses incur. Is the difference in `experience' provided by traditional campuses worth the price? Is there some hybrid model that we should be considering?

They're all there--the heavy atmospherics, the weight of the past, the good man who finally explodes in a rush of violence, the larger-than-life but plausible antagonist, prime southern gothic and the foods of the bayou. I'd set it one position behind what for me is now Burke's masterpiece, PURPLE CANE ROAD, because the plot meanders a bit in the second act, but it's a very close second and the bar which Burke has set remains out of reach for all but a handful of contemporary writers. Ladies and Gentlemen, this IS the state of the art.

Following The Silence of the Lambs by approximately a decade, The Wire in the Blood remains one of the great serial-killer novels, one that inspired a British television series that drew wide audiences.Focusing broadly on the profiling work of Dr. Tony Hill and the policing of DCI Carol Jordan, the villain is a prominent athletic and cultural figure in contemporary Britain. Who could believe that such a hero could be such a monster?And many among the police fail to believe it, so that Tony and Carol not only must deal with a highly intelligent criminal; they must also deal with unimaginative, bureaucratic thinking on the part of the individuals who are best positioned to collar the perp.There is a minor subplot on the profiling of an arsonist and the ongoing sexual tension between Tony and Carol. The canvas is large, consisting of a sizeable number of characters (at points the book reads like the exploits of several ensemble casts) and the geographical canvas is larger still, with cars hurtling along the motorway between London and Yorkshire.The novel is long and it builds slowly. The murderer is revealed early on and the plot becomes a cat-and-mouse affair, with a formidable antagonist. Bloody and violent in its action and scenes, the narrator does not linger over the details to a troubling degree. Still, this is strong stuff. The slow-build moves to a powerful crescendo that is quite satisfying.This is a classic; enjoy.

New York editors routinely seek crime and mystery manuscripts that transcend genre. Kate Atkinson's CASE HISTORIES could serve as exhibit A. A very literary novel with a Cambridge (U.K.) setting, the book introduces a detective, Jackson Brodie, of whom we are likely to see a great deal. Stephen King has blessed the book with a nice encomium and his judgment has been reinforced by the sales and attention reserved for a breakout book. In this case, however, the author's first book was a prize winner, so 'breakout' is perhaps off the mark, but the author's embrace of an attractive detective/hero and a popular genre, coupled with the literary anchors which are firmly in place from the beginning of the novel to its end, suggest that she will continue in this direction, having carved a niche that is likely to ensure popularity.The writing is deft and there is just the right mixture of learning, wit, inventive narrative, and sex to satisfy a spectrum of readers, from those who dote on Virginia Woolf to those who opt for Lee Child, the latter one of Kate Atkinson's favorites. The transcending of genre is perhaps most apparent in the novel's tone, which alternates between the profoundly sad and the hint-of-blue-sky optimistic. A literary novel that scrupulously sustains attention--what more could a reader desire?

This is the anthology to buy. Mona Wilson's collection from 1963 is also good, but the texts are less certain. Greene's annotations and bibliography are expert. He was the leading student of Johnson in the 20th century (after, he would say, his mentor James Clifford). I agree with Frank Lynch that it would be preferable to have the entire Journey here, but it is readily available elsewhere and students will find it very convenient to see some of Johnson's little-known but very important works (his life of Boerhaave, e.g. and his Sermon #5) available in this large but relatively inexpensive anthology.

Don't believe the hype; enjoy it. The hype is pythonesque; this is actually a formal documentary featuring recent interviews with the members of the troupe, except, of course, for Graham Chapman, who is featured in earlier interviews. It is a series of frank reflections on their productions, with intercut examples and commentary from a series of individuals from the (very broadly-defined) world of comedy. The focus is on the interviews. The pythons talk about one another's personalities and work habits and about the group dynamics that fed or deterred their creative process. The degree of Graham Chapman's alcoholism, e.g., is discussed at length. Cleese talks about his desire to leave the show when it became, in his opinion, repetitious. Palin wins the award for Mr. Congeniality . . . and so forth.The 6 hours move very briskly. We watched 3 hours at the first 'seating' and the time went swiftly. The interviews are fascinating and plentiful, with ample time for the discussion of the origins of specific sketches, the historical influences on the individual members of the troupe, the ethos, politics and frequent silliness of the BBC, and so forth. For python fans, this is an absolute don't miss.

This movie has gotten some unnecessarily bad press. It's basically a Cinderella story with wine. The performances are excellent and the Louis Jourdan subplot is clever. This is a straightforward romantic comedy with some international adventure elements. The script is by the great William Goldman. I've seen it again and again. It's sweet and endearing and the wine information is accurate. Check it out. You have nothing to lose and you probably have a wine-loving friend or two who will find it fun.

This is a don't miss-stunner. Produced by Chris Kelly (of Kavanagh, Q.C.), it stars Ross Kemp as DC Jack Mowbray and Kenneth Cranham as his governor, DCS Derek Henderson. They are investigating a series of brutal murders in Bristol and southern Wales. The murderer drives a blue Peugeot and attacks his victims with a hammer and edged instrument. Only one case (initially excluded) involves sexual violation. The serial murders appear to be without motive.The acting is nothing short of superb, the direction highly-skilled, the production values high. This is gritty, serious drama with very little comic relief, but it is not difficult to watch. On the contrary, it is riveting, since the private lives of several of the characters are explored at length. In some of the later episodes the balance of drama to crime fiction becomes something like 80/20, as the tears flow, the eyes twitch and the circles around them grow deeper and darker.This is the kind of thing that the Brits do so well; it is a real pity that the 12-part series is not better known in America. I would rank this among the very best of the British crime dramas and urge those who delight in such work to check it out.One caveat: once you start to watch this, you will have a great deal of difficulty stopping. You will be sleep-deprived but deeply moved. This is the real deal; enjoy it.

Set in the 1950's during the Suez Crisis, a fledgling BBC news program wrestles with the responsibility to tell the truth in the face of government pressure. In some ways, this is a paean to the BBC by the BBC. It includes an array of top flight British actors, including Dominic West, Anton Lesser, Tim Pigott-Smith, Juliet Stevenson and Anna Chancellor and generally manages to hold our attention and highlight important issues.The production values are very strong, the sets beautiful, the lighting evocative. Ben Whishaw gives a standout performance as the working class journalist, Freddie Lyon, and Dominic West is superb as an upper class Oxbridge news anchor who is sometimes a little thick between the ears and a little overheated in the nether regions.My problem is with the script and my problem will not be a problem for all. The six-episode series attempts to be all things to all people. At the center of the story is a news/crisis/political pressure plot. That is related to an MI6 espionage plot in which a female friend of journalist Freddie Lyon (in whose country home he was protected during the war) has been murdered to keep her from revealing sensitive information. Meanwhile, the news anchor is having an affair with his producer, a producer who is a spunky television journalist trying to break the old boys' glass ceiling and carve out a more important place for women at the Beeb. From one perspective there is something here for everyone: political/journalistic/television history; a story of espionage/suspense; a story of the British class system and its seemingly endless tentacles; a woman-in-the-workplace story of courage in the face of struggle; and a tale of passion and sex in that same workplace.For some this will answer every need. For me, this is a script in search of a focus, any one of which would have worked well. However, instead of a tight narrative we get a cover-all-the-bases pastiche. This results in significant problems with tone. On the one hand, e.g., we have a wonderful action scene in which men fight with knives. At the same time we get a hilarious scene in which an addled guest on the show, `The Hour', tells the anchor/host about the best driving routes from Biggin Hill to central London, with serious warnings concerning the traffic on Bayswater Road. The scene is worthy of the Pythons at their best, but it jostles with the scene of a realistic knife fight.Everyone is smoking, of course, everywhere and always, as realism demands, and they're also drinking, everywhere and always. Too much `realism', however, becomes distracting and the cigarettes become crutches, the acting too mannered.Still and all, check it out for yourself. You might love it. Don't be put off by the first episode, which starts very slowly. The final episodes have much more urgency.

If you missed this on PBS' contemporary mystery series, it is well worth seeing. Based on the Val MacDermid standalone novel, the story is told in past and present time. A girl goes missing in the 1960's in a remote Derbyshire village; her case is investigated by a young inspector. Her stepfather is found guilty, on circumstantial evidence, and is executed, though the girl's body is never found. In present time a TV reporter, played by Juliet Stevenson, investigates the case, interviewing the original inspector, his detective sergeant and several of the townspeople. The narrative cuts between past and present; the direction is strong, the production values high. There is a loose end or two in the resolution. While not quite a muddle certain things remain unexplained, though the general points are clear. The acting is superb, the pacing far more breathless than that of the original novel (which is still strongly recommended). Mystery buffs will note that while the story feels like 'true crime' its ending is one that Agatha Christie might have written.

Do not try to read this book if you are under the control of any substances, including a full meal. It requires your utter and complete attention. For various reasons I was forced to read it in fits and starts, mostly late at night. The plot is more like one of CW's nightmares than a linear narrative. But here's the Crumley magic--once in, even if you're totally confused, you can't stop reading. CW's voice remains as unique as the circumstances in which he finds himself and, ironically, even when you're lost within the plot you re-discover that Crumley is the master at rendering a sense of place. He knows the west and the northern plains and here takes you on a trip that would curl the most experienced tour director's locks.

This is not Elmore Leonard's best novel, but it has some of his bestlines ever and in Robert Taylor we may have found Leonard's bestcharacter since Chili Palmer.A civil war reprised, with the Detroit outfit taking over the drugturf of the Dixie mafia, it culminates--exquisitely--in a reenactmentof a real civil war battle. Who but Elmore Leonard would come up withthat and who but Elmore Leonard would people his comic drama withsuch a rich array of characters with thick heads and overactiveglands?The master loses points for the convolutions of the plot and theoccasional difficulty the reader has in distinguishing the manycharacters. Leonard knows right where he's going, but we have to holdon very tight to stay with him.Nevertheless, this is where the writers go to school--to hear acharacter's snores described as 'zoo' sounds, and to see the detailsof professional diving and the technicalities of civil war uniformsand ordnance described with perfect accuracy.N.B.: not for airplane reading; this one requires your full attention(and repays it).

No, it's not the old pop ballad. Here, we're falling into the abyss. The Andrew Davies script and Michael Kitchen performance are worth the price of admission. Kitchen plays the innocuously named Henry Kent, a local Yorkshireman living on a canal boat. When a London novelist (the wonderful Penelope Wilton) arrives at her recently-purchased cottage, fresh from a failed marriage and ready to go to work, Henry appears. He offers his gardening services, then volunteers to take care of the cottage in her absence, then volunteers to help warm her bed. He tells her stories of lost loves and his victimization at the hands of the class system. Slowly it dawns on her that he is not quite what he appears to be. Her agent and a gay male friend both scope him out as bad news from the get-go. It takes the novelist longer, since he has expressed his love for her and exhibited his sexual prowess on cold, damp Yorkshire nights. After they argue and he strikes her she sets off on an investigation of his past and learns what has really happened. He is an opportunist who exploits wealthy women . . . or worse.This is a small film, but not a claustrophobic one. Many of us think of Michael Kitchen as the benevolent Christopher Foyle, but he has long played villain roles. He plays them expertly. Falling is creepy and laced with tension but it is not full-tilt gothic with blood splattering across the walls. It is plausible, domestic gothic, with good direction, an excellent script and superb performances. Also some brief nudity and adult language. Watch this before you hire any volunteers to fix up your garden.

Everything Block writes is worth reading, but this is more for the cozy reader. It's a little talky. The plot appears to meander. Only at the end do we see how complex it all is. There are bows to genre which are conventional to the point of spoofy irony--locked room problems, mystification, misdirection, McGuffins, and a resolution before the assembled dramatis personae. That resolution is complex to the point of tedium. It's all done with a great light touch and fully displays Block's skills and powers, but readers whose tastes run to the harder boiled should be warned that this may not be to their liking.

Lawrence Block has always been able to demonstrate the possibility of writing complex mysteries in crystal-clear prose. He is the master of the difficult task of making things look easy.In HOPE TO DIE Matt Scudder is 62 and while the book does not dwell on it unnecessarily, it does take a more personal turn. His ex-wife dies; we learn more about his two sons, and we see him in domestic circumstances with Elaine. We also see more of T.J., the figure who might normally serve as the black buddy in the wilderness but in the Scudder novels also figures as the cool kid brother or surrogate son, hip to computer technology, the possible uses of cell phones and other information age devices.This is a nice touch. It enables Block to bring these cultural devices into his fiction without turning Matt (who resists them) into an implausible Mr. Wizard.There are nice views of the upper west side and several trips to Brooklyn, with recurring riffs on the curious nature of its streets and their naming.The twist in the story is its conclusion, which opens the door to sequels. In sum, this is classic Block--smooth as the seat of an accountant's pants. The perp is interesting enough and Matt and T.J. serve up handsome slices of weltschmerz. If you're tithing like Matt, save some money for this book.

So here it is, short and sweet: superb atmospherics, superb acting, superb script, superb direction. The script is leaner than the novel. The essentials are preserved, but some elements are excised (principally Blomkvist's relationships with other women than Lisbeth). Several of my women friends have commented on the level of violence in the novel. The violence is here as well, but Lisbeth's reactions to it are worth the price of admission. Sometimes she serves her dishes of revenge cold, sometimes a little warmer. She is one of the best characters in contemporary popular culture and here she is played to a fare-thee-well. Everyone is looking forward to the American film version, but at this point it is hard to see how this one can be topped.Don't wait. See this one now.

Michael Caine is Harry Brown. He lives in a nasty council estate ruled by drug-dealing thugs. For the moment, he has other things on his mind. His beloved wife Kath is dying and it is questionable whether or not she is even aware of Harry's presence when he comes to visit her. Kath doesn't make it through the first reel.He has a single friend, Len, with whom he plays chess in a local, seedy pub. The toughs are starting to confront Len, to harass him and humiliate him. Harry tells him to go to the police. Len's already been to the police; it's time to stand up. He shows Harry his weapon--a bayonet that looks very nasty. Unfortunately, Len is old and outnumbered. Len doesn't make it out alive either.A detective comes to visit Harry, to inform him of Len's death and to console him. She looks at the photos in Harry's flat. Harry is a former Marine. Much-decorated. He served in Northern Ireland. Effectively.Harry is confronted by a heroin-addled mugger who puts his knife point below Harry's eyes. Suddenly the knife is in the mugger's chest.Harry goes to a pair of drug dealers to buy a gun. By the time he is finished he has three guns; the drug dealers are both dead; their marijuana farm is ablaze; a young girl that they have abused and exploited is taken to the hospital to recuperate.The police are swanning around, acting as if they are going to take out the drug dealers on the council estate; the kindly detective (and her sergeant) are caught in the middle. They're worried about an ex-Marine with a grudge and some heavy skills. I'll leave the delicious ending to the viewer, who can probably see where this is going.The film is very gritty, with ugly, explicit sex and violence. This is a serious revenge story and who better to carry it than Michael Caine? The lessons are all grim and the Britain that it depicts is a long way from the theme park Britain on the travel posters. While it is unrelievedly dark, there is justice at the end. Lots of it.

The inaugural novel in the Cork O'Connor series, Iron Lake sets the very high standard to which William Kent Krueger has always been able to adhere.A ruthless judge is found dead just at the same time that the boy who delivers his newspaper has disappeared. The death is ruled a suicide, though the lividity evidence suggests to Cork that something else has occurred. Unfortunately, the body is cremated before Cork can proceed with a further investigation of this circumstance.He proceeds anyway, and as he does the bodies pile up, bodies whose names have been heard swirling in the atmosphere. Henry Meloux suggests the presence of an ice-hearted Windigo whose enunciation of their names foreshadows their deaths. Henry cautions Cork that the only way to confront the Windigo is to become as ice-hearted as he is.Cork's investigation takes him into the details of the judge's life, the machinations of his son (who is now involved with Cork's estranged wife), the activities of a local militia group, the finances of a reservation casino and the private lives of multiple individuals in Aurora and environs.As with many of the Cork O'Connor books, the investigation which serves as the principal plot arc is paralleled by a personal story, in this case Cork's relationships with his wife and a local woman, Molly Nurmi. Cork has lost his job as sheriff of Aurora and his personal life is in turmoil, his investigation offering the hope of some portion of personal redemption, even as he worries that his name might be spoken next by the Windigo.The setting is evoked with great skill; the Ojibwe lore is fascinating; the characters are rounded and interesting. A superb, award-winning novel, this is an excellent introduction to the series. While each novel stands on its own, there are changes in Cork's personal life across the series, so new readers may wish to begin here.If you are, indeed, a new reader, prepare yourself for a set of memorable experiences. This is one of the top crime series in contemporary American writing.

I've been hard on a number of the P.D. James adaptations, but Original Sin is much better than those I've recently reviewed. For one thing, it's shot on film and the production values are high. The core concept--a publishing firm in a Venetian palace on the Thames in Wapping, with bodies piling up and sickness at the core--is clever and cinematic. The supporting cast is strong, with fine performances by Amanda Root and Ian Bannen, and the laconic Dalgleish is in his element here. London in general and the river in particular functions as a character in its own right and the atmospherics are good. Plus, it's not as long as Hamlet and Lear combined, as some of the adaptations seem to be. Other reviewers are correct: it would be helpful to have subtitles. Still and all, it's worth seeing.

What's not to like? Michael Kitchen, Sophie Okonedo (of Hotel Rwanda) and Phyllis Logan (a favorite Kitchen co-star). This is the dark Kitchen, not the sweet Christopher Foyle so many love. Kitchen is a superb character actor. Here he plays a businessman with a dodgy partner. The partner turns up dead after an expensive dinner party held by Kitchen for his wife on their 19th anniversary. There he meets Sophie's character, a government clerk who moonlights with a catering firm. At the party she notices Kitchen's wife and his partner playing hand-holding games behind the wife's back. Does Kitchen know that his partner is involved with his wife (and, worse still, has been draining money from the company so that he and the wife might plan a life together)? Sophie's character, Marcey, isn't sure if Greg (Kitchen) has killed his partner in reprisal or if the death was (as Greg claims) accidental. She finally believes Greg and together they work to move the body and establish credible alibis. As they try to keep their stories straight, Greg's wife Linda becomes suspicious and investigates. She admits, however, to contributing to the partner/lover's getaway fund, so everyone is guilty to some degree.The result is a cat-and-mouse, play-like drama (whose creator wrote for the superb Robbie Coltrane series, Cracker). The writing is consistently excellent, as are the performances and the direction. Kitchen is wonderful when he's on the edge and he's definitely on the edge in Alibi.Just under two hours. Curl up and enjoy.

This is a Michael Mann film, so you can be assured that the direction is more than competent. The period details are excellent; the film is stylish, with excellent art direction and costuming. The machine guns alone are worth the price of admission.The problem is that both Dillinger and Purvis are men of action, not words. Their speech is laconic and, in some cases little more than a series of grunts. I could have used subtitles for many of the scenes. The plot is straightforward. Dillinger robs banks; Purvis tries to catch him; Frank Nitti looks on; Dillinger robs more banks; everybody shoots machine guns; Purvis tries to catch him . . . The film does not have any noticeable themes and it does not engage us with any significant issues. The characters are largely two-dimensional; the love scenes involving Depp and Cotillard are predictable and unexceptional. The principal actors are not given the opportunity to show their chops and Stephen Lang is largely wasted. Crudup plays the wooden Hoover in a wooden way. Ribisi is a notable exception. His portrayal of Alvin Karpis is one of the best elements in the film. Watch for Diana Krall playing a torch singer.It's stylish; it's watchable; unfortunately, it's not as memorable as one might wish, considering the constituent elements which don't add up to the sum of their parts.

Why `sort of'? Mercy Falls is a self-contained novel, not the first segment of a pure two-parter, but there are loose threads at the end and you have to read Copper River to complete the story.Mercy Falls: Cork is shot at by a sniper and his deputy Marsha Dross is actually hit--seriously, but not fatally. Then a body is found, the body of Eddie Jacoby, a Chicago sleazoid negotiating a casino contract with the Ojibwe. He's been killed and also castrated.Eddie's got a brother named Ben who was involved with Cork's wife, Jo, back in their law school days at the University of Chicago. Ben's still carrying a torch for her and there are suspicions all around that he's trying to get back in her life, perhaps by having Cork taken out.Ben sends out a PI who's ex-FBI, with a body to match her skills at detection. Her job is to be Ben's eyes and ears and keep the investigation of Eddie's murder on track. She seems to be falling for Cork; can she be trusted?When a bomb turns up in Cork's car, his family is hustled off to Chicago, so that the girls can visit Northwestern and Notre Dame (to which they each aspire) and stay with Jo's sister and her ex-priest husband. When Jo goes off the radar Cork comes to Chicago and investigates. He pretty much cracks the case but is then targeted for a contract hit by Eddie and Ben's criminal father, Lou.[Spoiler alert] Cork goes on the lam and the hoods seeking a 500K payoff are in pursuit. Copper River begins with Cork suffering a bullet wound to his leg but escaping to a resort camp run by his cousin on Michigan's upper peninsula.Note: I have picked up the story in my review of Copper River. Check it out.Mercy Falls is a solid episode in the Cork O'Connor series. I wouldn't put it at the top but it's better than nearly everything else out there. It lacks some of the energy and drive of the other books and I must confess that I find the stresses and strains on Cork/Jo's marriage just a bit off-putting after awhile. Still, I devoured the book and recommend it highly. Four and a half stars. Copper River is better and introduces a set of very interesting characters. Don't miss either one.

This is a superb book, one that not only deflates the arguments of postmodern theory, but gets down to cases, demonstrating the flaws of postmodernism's pomps and works in treating discrete episodes of human history. This is not a screed, but a carefully and meticulously argued case. Armed with common sense and hard facts Windschuttle demonstrates the emptiness of those methods which proceed without them. The book is weighty and detailed, but Windschuttle writes with a light touch and a sure hand. The writing is exceptional and the results decisive.

This is a rich and subtle book whose prose is so smooth and lucid that it risks masking the depth of its thought. While it is a book of literary and cultural history it has philosophic roots and impulses without the dense language that often accompanies them.The title is straightforward enough--an account of the ways in which Americans have lost their sense of evil (which was often embodied in a fallen archangel). The author begins with the colonies--the old enemy coming to the new world--and proceeds across history to our own period.Ultimately, this is a book about secular rationality, secular epistemology, secular relativism--the current world in which intellectual elites (by and large) live and move and try to find their being. There are specific historical arguments. The horrors of the civil war and the first world war, for example, undercut our belief in providence and focused attention on luck and chance. (Of course, the Roman Goddess Fortuna and fortune's wheel were much in evidence in the Middle Ages and Renaissance despite the rise of Christianity, so we are talking here about stresses and emphases, not absolutes.) The rise of science obviated the need for certain religious/quasi-religious explanations. Witches largely disappeared because we had better explanations for human behavior and phenomena.Still, the need to believe, the hunger for transcendence, persists. Exorcisms are common in popular culture even if they have faded from common experience. Satan might not be the source of explanations in philosophy textbooks, but he is almost surely alive and well at a cineplex near you.The ultimate inspiration for Delbanco's argument is Augustinian (the Confessions remaining an important text in the general education program at Columbia). The evil with which we must ultimately deal is that of privation. Augustine moved beyond his flirtation with Manicheianism with its targeted, embodied, equal-and-opposing form of evil. The evil of privation is not the more banal type of evil that looks at the things which man cannot do (we cannot fly as the birds do, hear and smell as dogs do, etc.) but rather evil as absence, evil as emptiness, evil, ultimately, as a failure to love, as an ultimate selfishness (as Gilbert Osmond in Henry James's Portrait of a Lady, for example).And here is the problem for the secularist, Delbanco argues. While the secularist might find some psychic satisfaction in seeing evil in a historical, opposing `other', he or she still feels the need for transcendence, since the satisfactions of the secular prove to be ultimately unsatisfying. There is simply never enough, as Johnson pointed out in Rasselas, with his discussion of `the hunger of the imagination' or as Carlyle pointed out in Sartor Resartus with his discussion of the shoeshine boy who could not be made happy by all of the industrial wealth of Europe, because he has a soul in addition to a stomach.The secular evolutionary psychologist sees the development of humanity as, ultimately, a quest for survival, with selfish impulses (drives, genetic wiring) aiding us in that process. The truly `evolved' person, however, knows that selflessness can prove far more gratifying. If there is nothing worth dying for, there is nothing worth living for. Of course, we now see the evolutionary psychologists looking at selfless activities that confer evolutionary advantages, but the broad-brush sweep of contemporary secularism was advanced by simplistic readings of Darwin.The bottom line, which is both cultural and philosophic (in terms of relevant discourses) is that we have lost our language for dealing with evil at the same time that we feel its obvious presence. If we divide the world into secular rationalists and believers, it is difficult if not impossible for one to talk to the other because each sees the other's `language' as either sadly uninformed by faith or sadly weakened by superstition. This is what the death of Satan has wrought.A highly-recommended, important book.

The Jericho series is well worth watching, but its strengths are in its atmospherics more than in its scripts and its characters. Jericho himself is a nicely-realized figure, but his trench coat and hat, his talisman and his everpresent cigarette are more important to his portrayal than his language or skills at ratiocination. The real star of the show is 1950's London, with damp streets reflecting neon, nasty alleyways and deep class lines separating the (sometimes guilty) rich from the (sometimes innocent) poor. The ultimate effect is noir taken to the nth degree and there is sometimes a comic book dimension to the series, both in its graphics and in its use of colors, the gritty yellow of Jericho's trench coat reminding me of the stark yellow of Dick Tracy's. Many watch British drama for the country settings, the costumes and the domestic architecture. Watch Jericho for the urban setting, but remember that the 'realism' is highly stylized, unlike that seen in the world of, e.g., Jack Frost.

This is a book for a cool autumn day. When I finished it I immediately opened a nice bottle of wine and toasted the authors, whose descriptions had generated my thirst. First and foremost, this is a book about people, wine industry people in the throes of war. And then there are the Nazis, always prime fodder whether the form be fiction or non-fiction. In some ways the book is like an ensemble movie, with a set of parallel plot threads that are woven together at the end. The climax of the book is truly its high point. The end of the war, the magnificent 1945 vintage, and the individual stories, some quite moving, all come together in a warm and comforting crescendo. Whether you're a wine buff or a WWII buff, this is a very nice read. Keep your glass handy.

The plot is conventional--betrayal of a loyal soldier by a sleazeball assemblage of government types. The soldier must then fight the system to clear himself (against insuperable odds, etc. etc.). What makes this film special are the performances and the direction. All of the sniper/technology issues are handled expertly and while the film pushes standard emotional-response buttons it pushes them very, very well. It may just be me, but I wouldn't call a self-effacing, loyal soldier "Swagger" and I wouldn't shoot a scene in Canada and then label it the Wind River Valley in Wyoming. The Wind River Valley doesn't look like this and it's a place that a lot of viewers of the film will have seen. Aside from those reservations, this is well worth seeing. Wahlberg continues to make excellent choices.

By now the readers of these reviews should have a good sense of what this novel is about: very little. A sweet, shy farm boy goes off to college, switches from ag school to a&s;, studying literature; he stays on to take a Ph.D., is hired by his school and begins a life of teaching. He marries, ecstatically at first, but, soon, tragically, has a contretemps with his department head that lasts for twenty years, has an affair with a junior colleague, loses her under pressure from the embittered chairman and weak but friendly dean, settles in to a largely successful teaching career, sees his beloved daughter escape from his wife and home through unmarried pregnancy and eventually dies, as the one book that he has written falls from his hand into the silence. This is not a million laughs.The novel as a form has been successful for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the novel broke with the literature of the renaissance in demonstrating that the life (both interior and exterior) of an average individual (=a middle class individual) could be compelling and instructive. This is, quintessentially, Stoner. His simple, sad life is told in a compelling narrative that is extremely engaging and his emotional life is charted with the intensity of an action/adventure film.Thoreau said that all men lead lives of quiet desperation. Certainly, the characters in Stoner all do. The desperation is not, however, period-specific. The narrative spans the period of two wars and the great depression but there is none of the alienation of high modernism or the existential angst that often marks the works of this period. We are on the plains in central Missouri and life is hard enough without any European or Hollywood overtones. Life itself is struggle and if Stoner is subjected to the punishments of his embittered, troll-like department head, he is spared service in combat as well as the life on the farm to which his father and mother eventually succumb.The book is very, very sad, but it has glimmering moments and Stoner's personal form of courage (which may not always serve his best interests) stands as a small but inspiring monument to the human spirit. The most striking aspect of the novel, to me, is the absence of religious faith--whether as a force for hope and grace or as a force that fails in times of greatest need. It is simply absent and its absence is not felt (as it is, e.g., in The Great Gatsby). This strikes me as a curious but interesting aspect of a novel set in this place and at this time. Bill Stoner could have used its help. The world of the novel, however, is too stark for the introduction of religious, indeed, even vaguely 'spiritual' realities to intrude. If Edward Hopper had set out to write a great novel of the midwest, it would look and sound exactly like this. James Ellroy sometimes uses the phrase 'tragic realism' to describe certain forms of fiction. Here it fits. This is a very important book, but steel your mind for the experience before you embark upon it.

Munyurangabo is touching in its simplicity. A tale of two Rwandan boys, one is seeking love and validation from the parents he left three years earlier; the other is seeking revenge on the man responsible for the death of his own father. The narrative is straightforward and spare, with the emphasis on the two protagonists, their separate quests and their mutual relationship. This was shot in eleven days by American filmmaker, Lee Isaac Chung. The footage of the Rwandan countryside is particularly memorable. The performances are natural, sweet and moving. The message is predictable--the fact that the hope for the resolution of the hatred which spawned the genocide now resides in the young--but it is articulated in an effective way.

The two-part opening episode is worth the price of the set. Tom Conti plays a police DNA technician who was traumatized by a case, left the force and became a crime fiction writer. Now his life has become complicated. His wife (Samantha Bond) has been unfaithful to him and her lovers are turning up dead, positioned like the victim in one of the protagonist's previous cases. Moreover, the protagonist is suffering blackouts. Has he been killing people during these periods? Or is his son killing them in order to repair his parents' marriage? Who can we trust?The respective cases are driven by what appears to be decisive DNA evidence, but has that evidence been planted? The resulting story is an engaging drama, one that can easily be imagined on a West End stage. The writing is excellent, the production values high, the acting expert.Some reviewers have found it slow; I did not. This is high-tension psychological drama in which the characters are trying to psych out motives, intentions, eye movements and slips of the tongue. While there is some violence and sexual tension this is not a car-chase shoot `em up or a microscope-laden CSI drama. There are procedural elements, but basically it's all about the people, how they feel about one another, what they're capable of doing to one another and how we require trust in order to live our lives and solve our crimes.Highly recommended.

Derek Bok's books are always interesting and always reliable, within certain parameters. They are anchored in research; every observation, including the uncontroversial ones, are footnoted. The facts and data are always there and they are always interesting. And the research is complemented by experience--decades as president of Harvard, after all.So where is the problem? There is no problem, but there is an issue and Bok's recommendations in this book must be seen in light of it: he is, at base, a law school professor. This serves him very well when, for example (in another of his books) he is writing about the threats to the modern university of commercialization. He can expertly state the history, the precedents, the advantages and the liabilities. In this book, however, he is talking about undergraduate education, when he spent a large portion of his career teaching in a top, post-baccalaureate professional school.One example: he argues for engaged learning, i.e., students actively participating in class, studying problems and issues, discussing them among themselves and hashing them out in a small class taught by a member of the regular faculty. He is very cool on lecturing, arguing that little is learned in that way and that most of it is forgotten anyway. He is, in fact, cool on `content' in class. At this stage in our civilization there is too much to be learned. Hence, the students should obtain the content for themselves and then, actively discuss the issues in class. As Professor Kingsfield said, "You teach yourselves the law; I teach you how to think like a lawyer."And that's fine in law school, but lecturing has been common for nearly a millennium for a reason. Some material (in a basic science class, e.g.) is better conveyed through didactic instruction. Some material requires the help of an experienced scholar because the students will require contextual information to understand it (the thought of Wittgenstein, e.g. or the multiple meanings of `romanticism').Bok's focal point of experience is (as with all of us) both personal and unique. He comes from a distinguished legal family; his wife's parents were both Nobel laureates. He attended Stanford and Harvard. He has taught in and been president of an institution that is unique in American higher education. He is used to teaching students who are very gifted, highly motivated and very well prepared. His notions of a classroom experience or the potential nature of a classroom experience will be very different from those of individuals teaching at regional, public 4-year institutions or community colleges.What does the book argue? Bok positions himself, explicitly, between the earlier, conservative critics who were troubled by the erosion of general education, the study of the so-called great books and such issues as political correctness and affirmative action and the contemporary public voices lamenting the rise in costs, the indebtedness which students carry and the demand for more vocational education. He focuses upon a number of things which we should do far better than we do, e.g., preparing students for citizenship, developing multiple interests beyond the purely vocational, fostering critical thinking skills, inculcating a `global' perspective and a high comfort level with `diversity', aiding moral development and honing students' skills in both written communication and public speaking.It is very interesting that (in a book focusing on underperformance) he spends very, very little time talking about such things as grade inflation or `expectations'. Fundamentally, students are learning less because they are not asked to learn more and they are graded ever more generously for accomplishing less. Bok's conservative Government department colleague, Harvey Mansfield, now gives his students two grades--the grade that they actually earned and the grade that the Harvard ethos would now demand.There is very little in the book concerning students' lifelong reading habits or the cultivation of curiosity and virtually nothing that I recall concerning the involvement of undergraduate students in faculty research. While there is a body of educational research which he marshals to make his points, Bok acknowledges that educational research is often squishy and is unlikely to convince the faculty. And this is correct. Hence, he recommends local studies, more pertinent to the individual institution. And that is correct. However, the culture from school to school is vastly different, as he notes, with harsh comments, e.g., for the engineers (some of whose skills--in writing, e.g.--even regress during college).In the areas where he has recommendations (e.g. public speaking skills) he displays impressive knowledge of the `state of the issue', the `state of the research' and so on; for the issues which he chooses to highlight his voice is informed, reliable, clear and articulate, if not impassioned. He is not impassioned because he accepts two major constraints which, he believes, he is powerless to change: a) the wishes of the faculty and b) the wishes of the students.He accepts the notion of the student as consumer and says that colleges must accede to students' wishes if they are to maintain market share, enjoy deep applicant pools and, inevitably, solid USNews rankings. However, if there is any institution in the country which is positioned to go a separate way here, it is Harvard. Harvard could hire faculty capable of teaching anything in any way. Harvard could offer students what it believed to be an authentic, enduring, coherent educational experience and say, `take it or leave it'. And if Harvard did that, all of the institutions which aspired to be like Harvard would follow its lead.He is also, it must be said, very nave with regard to specific issues. He talks about the `great books approach' and says that while it actually is the only approach which shows concrete, positive results, those results might be due to the fact that the instruction was conducted actively rather than passively and in small classes. However, he says, the `great books approach', previously associated with Chicago and, to a degree, Columbia and now principally associated with St. John's in Maryland and New Mexico, has never been widely adopted because the students don't want it. St. John's attracts less than 1,000 applicants and admits of them, many of whom matriculate elsewhere.There is a great difference between a doctrinaire great books approach (in order to learn Chemistry we will read Lavoisier) and a coherent curriculum which exposes students to great writing and historically-consequential writing (among many other things). Should students hold a baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts who cannot give a simple explanation of the thought of Freud, Marx, or Adam Smith? Should every educated person have read Shakespeare? Should she or he know the meaning of a `Faustian bargain' or the connotations of the word `spartan'? "Cultural literacy" (generally associated with grammar- and high school education, but also a part of general education at the college level) is very different from the `great books approach'. The problem now is that no one wants to define that `literacy'. The result is that, as Wanda Red writes as an Amazon reviewer of Bok's book, "a student could graduate from the ideal university, described in this book, without having taken a single course that studied the world before 1900."For me, the problem is that the ivy league in general and Harvard in particular set(s) the bar for all aspiring institutions. Their students, however, come, in many cases, from wealth, privilege and top preparatory schools. They are also gifted. They already have a great deal of cultural literacy as well as social capital. First-generation college students, minority students, working-class students, immigrant students often do not. However, if Harvard acts as if a serious program of general education, with specific requirements, is unnecessary, others will as well. In one very interesting section of the book, Bok discusses the benefits of vocational vs. liberal arts education in the workplace. Vocational ed is very useful for the first ten years. In the next ten years, however, when promotions are at stake, the liberal arts graduate has the advantage. For the executive boardroom, neither--Bok argues--has an identifiable advantage. Without a solid liberal arts education (including a coherent general education component), the minority student, the first-generation college student, the working class student and the immigrant student will all be at a considerable disadvantage and the (ultimately shortsighted) demands for university education that is increasingly vocational will accelerate and, increasingly, be heeded.

For those who have run through every episode of Morse and want more, check out Kavanagh Q.C. In this series, shot before the Morse saga had run its course, John Thaw plays a barrister who chops, dices, cuts, eviscerates and wins. Sporting world-class shirtings (as the British say) and cuff links, ties to die for and Savile Row suits, Thaw looks every bit the part. This is L.A. Law done with far greater class and skill. The cast includes major British actors in recurring roles, with guest shots from the British pantheon. This is real courtroom drama and in many ways it transcends the Perry Mason standard, since the ceremonious nature of the British court is a thin veneer over a system that feels far more urgent and far more violent. A large portion of each episode is devoted to the maneuverings of the lawyers, the pounding and hounding of witnesses, admonitions from the bench and twitches from the defendant in the dock. The reaction shots (when points are scored) are marvelous. Thaw is not playing Morse with a wig; Kavanagh is a wholly independent creation, but Thaw nails him (as he nails Morse). The look, feel, pace and ethos of the two series are quite different, but each is excellent. Highly recommended.

The stories are nicely written and nicely shot, with engaging characters and a locale of stark beauty. The episodes which I have seen, however, have been resolutely sad. It is, after all, postwar Scotland and things are tough, but so far I've seen a child dying of meningitis because the drug that would have cured him is in too short supply; a spinster about to be married but having second thoughts because the man has taken in a difficult relative; a son poisoning his father with arsenic but (oh well) he was dying of gastric carcinoma anyway; and a young girl who should be in school but has taken responsibility for her younger sisters because her father has left for opportunities in London (but not sent money home) and the mother who works in a dangerous factory has just been diagnosed with epilepsy. The stories are bittersweet in tone and the central characters all likeable, but in the balance of pain and joy the pain has been consistently winning. I'll see other episodes, because the series is done so well, but so far the stories have been predominantly sad (and often unresolved).

This is the masterpiece of the L.A. Quartet series. By this point Ellroy had mastered his 'new' staccato cum John Dos Passos panorama style and he had established the foundation for his vision of a nasty slice of American history--the work of behind-the-scenes men motivated by raw need and raw pain. The plot is sprawling but, ultimately, tight as a toad's posterior, and the novel's epigraph (a glory that costs everything and means nothing) ripples across the pages like a blood-red tide. This is an absolute don't miss. Fans of the film will find some significant differences here, but they will not be disappointed.

This is Parker on the stretch, away from his favorite characters, away from his Boston setting, plunged into the past. When he's stretched he's at the top of his form and demonstrates his moves on every page.Most of all, the Jackie Robinson story is a story about a time and the first third of the book is background. Parker does the postwar period masterfully and the interspersed personal chapters are a nice, innovative touch. They've drawn some criticism, unwarranted in my opinion.The characters are fresh, the plotting and dialogue as economical as the best Parker, the resolution touching. I read it straight through, disrupting all of my prior plans for the day, and not regretting a moment of it.

Released as "The Baker" in England, this film was directed by Damian Lewis' brother and features a cameo appearance by Michael Gambon. It is a pleasant, small comedy, featuring a hitman who has a midlife (actually a very early-life) crisis and decides to abandon his 'profession'. His boss, Gambon, has a hideout in Wales, which turns out to be a bakery. Milo (Lewis) tries on his new lifestyle, but his former job is discovered and nearly all of the members of the local citizenry want him to kill someone for them. Meanwhile, a London hitman follows him to Wales in an attempt to kill him. Milo wants none of any of this. He just wants to bake and fall in love with Rhiannon (as Stevie Nicks' fans know; this is the name of a Welsh witch, though Milo's Rhiannon is a veterinarian). Everything works out pleasantly, of course. This is a small film and a relatively brief one, but a sweet evening's entertainment and Lewis never disappoints.For those with all-region DVD players, the U.K. version has some nice subsidiary material.

I just returned from Ebertfest. Shotgun stories was my second favorite film, with first place going to von Sternberg's silent classic, Underworld. With an academy-award winning script by Ben Hecht and superb acting from Clive Brook, Evelyn Brent and George Bancroft this is, to say the least, stiff competition. Shotgun Stories is a small movie by a first-time director working on a small budget. Nevertheless, it is a superb piece of work. Set in Arkansas it is the story of a feud between two families who share a common father. The director is Jeff Nichols. Remember that name; you will be hearing it again and again. This little film, which Nichols also wrote, is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and fully realized. I would not change a word or a moment of screen time. Michael Shannon's acting is particularly memorable, but every member of the cast is excellent. The plot is starkly simple. A man dies. The children from his first marriage come to the funeral, where the man is mourned by the wife and children of his second family. One speaks briefly and then spits on his coffin. An old feud is rekindled. Violence follows, violence that is, ultimately, muted by the deep but barely-stated emotions of the brothers from the first family and the women who love them. That is all and it is utter magic.

I have not yet read all of the Myron Bolitar books, but I've read several handfulls and this is the best of a very strong set. The characters are engaging, the plot complex but transparent and easily followed. This is the most craftsmanlike of the Bolitar novels, a finely-polished piece of fiction that would make any mystery writer proud. Read it anywhere; it will hold your attention and help you shut out the white noise.My only criticism is that when justice is meted out to the baddies it happens too quickly and too painlessly. Coben has introduced and developed these characters at length and instilled in the reader a white hot desire for justice. It comes, but its manner is not commensurate with the desire he has carefully built. Mickey Spillane (RIP, Mickey, who just left us) would have hit them until they bubbled and then kicked them until they stopped. And we would have been cheering all the while.

Richard Russo's novel joins with the works of James Hynes and David Lodge as among the most incisive treatments of English department life at our disposal. Russo's is the most ambitious, Lodge's the most amusing, Hynes's the most critical. Together they cover the subject nicely and it is a subject deserving of love and attention as well as criticism or even, for some, scorn. Russo's and Lodge's are close to documentaries, but Russo's is the most realistic, focusing as it does on the lives of those at midlist institutions. The book is by turns sad and comic, with a number of moments that prompt deep laughter. Most of all, it tells the sort of story for which the novelistic genre was created--highlighting the small acts of heroism of which average people are capable.My only problem with the novel is whether or not it should be required reading for those contemplating an academic career or for those ending one. Those who have survived what was once, perhaps, a nave decision might find comfort in it as well as amusement. Those still weighing their options might ponder Russo's story and instead consider applying for law school.

Michael Robotham is a writer to watch. This is the first of his three novels. While characters repeat across the novels, each book has a separate protagonist. The story here is a conventional one--an innocent man is suspected of a crime; as the police try to find him, he tries to find the guilty man. While the story is conventional, Robotham's execution is anything but. The writing is expert, the plotting compelling, the setting nicely realized. While the ground is, ultimately, littered with bodies, the action is principally psychological. The protagonist is a psychologist, surrounded by sick patients, some of whom have become victims. While the protagonist runs up and down the English and Welsh landscape, the action is largely within his mind and heart and Robotham's depiction of the tumult and turmoil there is extremely impressive. I predict that Robotham will become a household-name writer. He deserves to be.

James Lee Burke began his career writing mainstream fiction. The Lost Get-Back Boogie is (with To the Bright and Shining Sun) his mainstream masterpiece. Short-listed for the Pulitzer, it tells the story of Iry Paret, a Korean War vet with a string of (mostly self-induced) bad luck. Paroled from Angola, he travels from Louisiana to Montana to work for the family of an old prison pal, Buddy Riordan. Essentially, he leaves his own dysfunctional family and dysfunctional situation for Buddy's. In the course of the novel he must make choices which bring him to personal independence, adulthood and some measurable degree of happiness. The constituent elements of nearly every Burke novel are here: lush description, violence, the temptations of drink, the need for personal redemption. This is not crime fiction per se, but there is a great deal of crime here. Fans of Dave Robicheaux will see elements of Dave in Iry (and a few elements of Clete in Buddy). The book is strong in its constituent elements, but very subtle in its influences. Iry struggles throughout the book to complete his song ('The Lost Get-Back Boogie'), a personal memoir of the good life in Louisiana. He must bring his imaginative life into synch with his day-to-day emotional life and he cannot complete the song until he completes his own (painful, quietist) redemptive process. This is a beautiful book. Highly recommended.

She's not playing Mama this time. Vera Stanhope is a Northumbrian detective with a handsome, much younger sidekick. Getting up there in years, Vera is overweight, disheveled, rumpled and initially non-threatening with her Geordie accent. Beware of her, however, when she stops going all-Columbo on you and homes in, staring holes through your forehead and promising you long nights in a cold cell. The aw-shucks casual questioner becomes the grand inquisitor the moment she has all of the facts in hand.The stories (4 to date) are strong, the plots reasonably clear, the supporting cast effective. The tone is dark, the crimes heinous. The closest parallel is the Kenneth Branagh Wallander series, with panoramic views of stark landscapes, landscapes that parallel the moral emptiness of the perps and their stories. The tone is slightly different, with an older, female protagonist, but Vera suffers from the same varieties of loneliness as Wallander and in each case the moral undertone is that we are witnessing a detective who sacrifices the rest of life to this task because it is a personal and professional obligation. There is some of that in Frost, of course, but Frost adds humor, romantic subplots, and the love of good Indian food. Vera Stanhope, by contrast, is all business.This is a promising new series. Check it out, but prepare yourself for a tour of the other side of human life.

It's all here--murder, mayhem, terrorism, duplicitous G-men, corrupt lawyers, a beautiful woman . . . and Joe Pike. Elvis is along for the ride, but this is Joe's show. Elvis' invincible sidekick, Rambo in La-La land.The plot is tight, the canvas small, the pages flying as fast as the books are leaving the shelves. This is the first top-flight crime novel of 2007. How could it not be, with JP at center stage? Whatever you expected, you won't be disappointed. There's even some additional information on Joe's youth, his brief career in the LAPD and (heaven forfend) a brush with love.This is the complete package. Buy it now, but don't start reading it until you've blocked out the time to read it through.Memo to Robert Crais: send us more Joe Pike at your earliest convenience.

The sequel (of sorts) to Mercy Falls, Copper River stands on its own feet and is one of the best books in the Cork O'Connor series.In Mercy Falls Cork is the target of any number of contract killers, chasing a $500K payoff if they can find and kill him. Catching a bullet in his leg he bleeds all over the seat of a car he has purchased and somehow finds the wherewithal to drive to the upper peninsula of Michigan. His cousin, Jewel DuBois, lives there with her son Ren. They have a set of resort cabins which they no longer rent out. Jewel is a veterinarian and a widow; her son Ren has a friend, Charlie (Charlene). Both quirky kids, they understand each other and are fast friends.When they see a body drifting in the Copper River, their world starts to come apart. Someone is killing young women and whoever they are, they're after Charlie, Ren and one of their friends.Into this world comes Dina Willner, an ex-FBI `security consultant' who first appeared in Mercy Falls. An ambiguous character there, she is now firmly in Cork's corner and represents some serious firepower for the side of the angels. So far Cork has been lucky in eluding any possible hitmen and he can devote his mental attention to protecting Charlie, Ren and Jewel and trying to solve the murder of the young woman in the river.Physically, Cork is on the sidelines this time. He is barely ambulatory and his wound has a way of breaking open just when he least needs that to happen. Dina, Ren and Charlie take center stage and they are fully capable of carrying the novel. Krueger has created a series of excellent, fresh characters for Copper River and it would be very nice to see them again. And again.Krueger always aces his novels' settings and always has interesting characters, many of them repeating characters. In Copper River we get a new cast, a new setting, some horrific bad guys and a complex, driving plot. This is one of my favorite books in the O'Connor series and I have to ask its author a question that must be on the minds of many of his readers. When can we expect a separate series, featuring Dina Millner, her stunning green eyes, Glock, lockpick tools, et al.? (Charlie could also serve as her wily sidekick.) You write them; I'll buy them.Very highly recommended.

Todd Gitlin's account of the sixties is part history, part autobiography. As a sometime president of SDS Gitlin was fully immersed in the actions of that period and discusses them with an intensity and level of specificity that most later historians would not be able to muster. At the same time, Gitlin is one of the country's premier sociologists dealing with media, culture and life as lived and experienced.He is scrupulously fair--fair to his own principles and fair to his own experiences, but equally fair with regard to reality. He does not whitewash the sixties; he chronicles them. He does so with a clear eye for their idealism and their earnestness as well as their excess. He sees their successes and he sees their long-term deleterious effects.Basically, the story is a simple one. The sixties' political movements worked in two directions: to help others and to free the self. The former was much more successful than the latter. The former now enjoys widespread support (for black civil rights and women's rights in particular). The protests against the war and the manner in which the war was justified and prosecuted are a more complex issue that continues to be divisive. The expansion of the space for the self, on the other hand, is more subject to criticism, particularly in the effects which Gitlin itemizes--the ravages of drugs, challenges to family commitment, out of wedlock births, grade inflation, and so on.The book is long, as it needs to be, but it is beautifully written. The style is paratactic and additive, breathlessly listing events, names, issues, lifestyles, successes and ravages. A number of sociologists write well, but few as well as Gitlin. He is also a novelist. Crime readers who have not read his novel, The Murder of Albert Einstein, have missed a work of great skill.The sixties are a bittersweet subject, mostly sweet for some, mostly bitter for others, but they must be seen in all of their facets. Most of all, they were a cultural experience and Gitlin is particularly well positioned to describe how they felt. He does so with both urgency and immediacy as well as a mature eye.This is a very important book.

White Noise received the National Book Award and, as a result, it has attracted a great deal of critical attention. It is less `traditional' in its materials than DeLillo's novel about the Kennedy assassination, Libra. DeLillo actually uses the word `postmodern' in the course of White Noise and it is often labelled a postmodern novel.Postmodernism, as defined, e.g., by Jameson, involves a conflation of high culture with popular culture. It is (among many other things) a flat, in some ways ahistorical space in which facts, images and ideas of all kinds (and of all levels of `seriousness') compete for our attention and jostle within our consciousness. That certainly describes part of the ambiance of White Noise, particularly the first section of the novel.Another way of thinking about the book is to call it a `tale' rather than a novelistic fiction. The characters are thin, the narrative arcs are brittle; ideas are more important than human interactions. Like Pynchon's 'postmodern' novel, The Crying of Lot 49, White Noise is a story about America--different in its emphases but similar in some of its materials.White Noise tells you what `it is like' to be in America in the 1980's, `how it feels' to be in America in the 1980's. As such, it is phenomenological; it is endlessly descriptive of what things are like and the things and feelings are, in many ways, more important than the characters and the story. The narrative is wonderfully inventive and imaginative; some of it is, literally, laugh-out-loud funny.The story concerns the family of Jack Gladney, a professor of Hitler studies (yes, the university comes in for its share of wry observations) at a small, fictional college in the Midwest (probably). Jack has had multiple wives, has multiple children from separate marriages and a Jewish colleague trying to install `Elvis studies', with whom he has interesting discussions. The first section of the novel establishes the ethos--a flat, strange culture, driven by electronics and communication systems very much like our own. Section two involves a hazardous material spill which becomes a black cloud hovering over Jack's environs. Section three concerns Jack's discovery that his wife has been unfaithful to him, trading her body for medication which will reduce or eradicate the fear of death.White Noise is the kind of book that some will adore and others find weird or `slow'. I found it fascinating and hypnotic. To read it is to `hear voices' that are always interesting, sometimes profound, often funny. Imagine a world in which religious faith has lost its foothold, a world in which the universities are peopled by individuals who comfortably teach Hitler studies (because they always yield academic work), a world in which the law and the government are sometimes intrusive, often strange and feckless, a world of electronic entertainments, one in which the only comfort and stability seems to come from watching small children sleep.Heady stuff, simultaneously strange and yet very familiar. Highly recommended.

This is, quite simply, the best British mystery series. Period. Morse, Dangerous Davies, Tom Barnaby, et al. are excellent, but Foyle is simply on another plane. Why? The Anthony Horowitz scripts are consistently superb. The period details are scrupulously evoked. (Part of the problem with the series is its cost. Each episode requires the extinguishing of road lines, the altering of signage, and a host of other touches in addition to the period costumes, cars, farm implements, and so on.) The fundamental concept is excellent--the so-called history meets mystery conceit. However, many historical mysteries are exaggerated, with over-the-top or stereotypical characters and bizarre events. Here, the actual facts of WWII meet the brutal realities of wayward humanity. Kitchen is the center piece and his acting is consistently astonishing in its economy and precision. He acts with his eyes and the slightest movement of his lips. A single word speaks paragraphs and the swirling emotions within are controlled and canalized. The supporting cast are excellent and the guest members of the ensembles consistently first-rate. This is simply in a class by itself. If you haven't yet discovered it, do. Immediately. And pray that the series is revived.

Of course, many already have, decades ago. Top of the Heap is a representative entry from the (Bertha) Cool and (Donald) Lam series. Bertha is the foul-mouthed, dictatorial partner, Lam the streetsmart investigator who does the bulk of the work. In Top of the Heap Cool and Lam represent a man in search of an alibi, an alibi attached to a string of actions which are themselves tied to another string of actions. The plot is immensely complex, though Lam explains it all, succinctly and lucidly, at the end. This is the kind of ending that many of the viewers of Lost are hoping for (I am writing a few weeks before that series' conclusion) but are highly unlikely to receive.Cool and Lam are based in Los Angeles, but Top of the Heap takes Lam to San Francisco, where the bulk of the action occurs. That action includes murder, gambling, laundered money, organized crime, lifestyles of the rich and famous, a yacht marina, a succession of attractive women and a gold mine. As I said, it's very complex.While the story is marked by multiple incidents and misdirection, all is finally resolved. Lam is likeable, though his explanation of the case seems disproportionate to what he has actually seen and learned. It is that kind of book, with all segments of the narrative building to the revelations at the end. Gardner is here writing as A. A. Fair and while many will prefer the Perry Mason books, this is still impressive work. I especially enjoyed the period details, Gardner's take on the San Francisco settings and most of all the value of the dollar lo those many years ago.

This is a talky mystery. At 4.5+ hours one can imagine its being done well in 2-3. The plot is complex--involving a drug dealer in London and the residents of a stately home in Suffolk, a stately home that also happens to be near a home for unwed mothers. The doings in London, the stately home and the home for unwed mothers are all connected in ways that are far from apparent. Enter Adam Dalgleish to sort things out, as the bodies pile up.Since the story is talky, the emotional level is high and the production is shot on tape rather than on film, it often looks and feels like a soap opera. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes for very different atmospherics than those common to English mysteries. I enjoyed Cover Her Face, but it is long and it is talky and the performances are a tad stilted and mannered. Several, however, are exceptional. With modest production values and a 1985 date, Cover Her Face will feel a bit thin to those familiar with the best of the British Mysteries (Foyle, Frost, Morse, et al.) but it is engaging enough to be worth a long summer afternoon's viewing.

It may just be me, but I found this excrutiatingly slow and very poorly directed. The plot is fine and the casting superb, but there is a low-budget feel to the direction that taints the overall effort. Dalgleish is investigating the murder of a forensics expert in a country-house lab. The interminable opening establishes that everyone in the cast is a plausible suspect. The cast includes such excellent actors as Brenda Blethyn and Barry Foster and Geoffrey Palmer plays the victim (who, by all accounts, deserved what he got). It all sounds good enough, but the lighting and the sound are wretched. In one crucial 'confession' scene, where lip and eye movement are essential, the characters are shot at a vast distance across a graveyard. When we finally come in and can actually see their faces, the laconic, pensive Dalgleish has turned away from the man to whom he is speaking. I get it that Dalgleish is a poet who has recently lost his wife, but he is also an investigator working amid a high body count situation. As others have noted, the result of the direction (and especially the fact that this is shot on tape, not film) is an appearance of utter amateurism on the part of gifted actors. At times the show looks like high school dramatics or small-town dinner theatre. That is a pity, given the quality of the novel on which the story is based. For me, this is a rental only.

This is an exceptional book. George Taber was the only journalist at the famous 1976 Paris tasting and the person best positioned to tell its story. The story, however, is a fairly simple and straightforward one. Man arranges tasting of French and California wines; California wines win; the French are aghast. This was a small event with huge repercussions. Hence, Taber spends the bulk of the book detailing the background which led to the event and the results that followed it. In doing so he gives a panoramic, if selective, account of current practices in the French and new world wine industries and--in the strongest sections of the book--tells the personal stories of the individuals whose lives were intertwined with the event. With the latter he is providing, in effect, a history of several of the key players in the Napa wine industry: Andre Tchelistcheff, Mike Grgich, Warren Winiarski (my all-time favorite academic), Robert Mondavi, et al.Like all compelling stories this is a very personal one, the events all turning on individual experiences and individual decisions. Hence there is a beautiful 'reality' about it, a reality that continues today. When you visit some of these individuals' wineries you are still likely to see them there, behind their desks or in their cellars, doing their thing. They changed the world of wine and this is a crucial part of their story.

So here's the deal: a priest friend of Dalgliesh invites him to visit him in his place near the Dorset coast. The priest is connected to a stately home/rest/medical facility whose staff wear monk's robes, though they're not monks. They may be murderers, arsonists, pornography readers, adulterers and drug dealers, but they're not monks. Dalgliesh arrives to find his friend dead and soon other bodies begin to pile up. Dalgliesh-on-holiday investigates, assessing the possible guilt of a relatively strong cast, including Pauline Collins and Art Malik.Unfortunately, the resulting film/mini-series is quite disappointing. I say this from the perspective of a viewer who has become accustomed to the quality of such shows as Morse, Inspector Lewis, Midsomer Murders, Frost, Pie in the Sky, The Last Detective and the incomparable Foyle's War. The Black Tower is at least twice as long as it needs to be. It is tediously talky; the acting is stilted and the production values poor. In one scene we hear two of the characters talking. They approach a house and the next shot is taken from the house's interior. They are still outside, but since they are on the other side of the door and windows the volume of their voices is diminished and we can't hear them clearly. In the final scene Dalgliesh runs to a phone to call the local constabulary, but the phone has been disconnected. A few minutes later another character uses the phone and the cavalry arrive promptly.Sound and continuity errors might be overlooked, but not when they affect major plot points. Similarly, a certain amount of talkiness might be expected in an English mystery set in a hothouse environment with a collection of snarky characters, but much of the talk is dull and the acting which accompanies it is surprisingly amateurish. Here, the actors sometimes perform as if they're on stage and need to indulge in exaggerated physical actions to hold the attention of the audience in the upper balcony, but film actors (as Michael Caine has taught us) act with their eyes (or should). Here, there is additional awkwardness. One of the characters has a bad leg and walks with a cane. Sometimes he appears to be misshapen and in pain, sometimes he seems normal.I don't want to spoil the story, but the crime turns on an action that involves a behavior that occurs only once a year and a criminal implement insufficient to accomplish anything beyond a relatively modest level of crime. It is, in short, preposterous, particularly in light of the number of people who have been sacrificed to protect the criminal activity.Rent this for a long evening's viewing when everything else is unavailable.

If Bernie Rhodenbarr of Lawrence Block's Burglar books became a secret agent, he might sound something like Evan Tanner--wry, sarcastic, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. However, Bernie sleeps at night; Tanner (after an injury to his brain's sleep center) does not. This condition does not play a major role in Tanner's Tiger's plot, but it does give the hero eight more hours in the day to do his job.Tanner works for a mysterious government agency, presided over by a person known only as `the Chief'. The chief calls and Tanner springs into action. In this case he's checking out the Cuban exhibition at the Montreal World Fair. He's taken his daughter Minna with him, but Minna immediately disappears. He meets a French Canadian named Arlette. Arlette has an overactive libido, a tiger-skin throw on her bed and a tiger-skin hat (hence the title), but Arlette too will disappear in the course of the story.Arlette is part of a separatist group that is making plans for the queen's visit to Montreal. Some want to kidnap her; some want to kill her. Since Tanner is on the run from Canadian authorities after his illegal border crossing, he must throw in his lot with the separatists, exhibit his street cred in leading their plotting but simultaneously do some back-channel work to protect the queen from serious harm (before he rescues Minna) and before he rescues Arlette.The tone is light, much of the violence muted, the plot wildly implausible, the novel great fun. At 237 pp. it is a perfect companion for a transatlantic flight (which Tanner himself may just experience in the course of the novel).Lawrence Block is incapable of writing a bad novel. I believe that his Matt Scudder novels are his very best, but if his name is on the cover you're always safe to take him in hand and proceed to the checkout.

This went immediately to dvd after the briefest of theatrical releases. Fear not. It's not a hash or a mish-mash. It's a linear detective story that holds the attention nicely. Based on the James Lee Burke novel, it offers some of the atmospherics that are the hallmark of Burke's art; it also has some Burkean lines thrown in for good measure. The casting is (finally) excellent, with Tommy Lee Jones as Dave and other stalwarts like John Goodman, Ned Beatty and the wonderful Buddy Guy. Those who are unfamiliar with the Robicheaux novels may find themselves struggling to catch up, though there are various exposition points which help fill in the blanks. The film (like the book) includes scenes in which an LSD-doped Dave begins talking to confederate warriors (here, in particular, John Bell Hood). This translates to 'magic realism' in the book and here the magic is in Levon Helm's performance as Hood.The Burke novels are so richly textured that the film seems somewhat lean, but it is better to attempt to capture some of the novels' atmosphere than to abandon the attempt. Jonathan Kellerman has called Burke the Faulkner of crime fiction and here we get a hint of what that means. The old south and the new converge in a haunted tale in which Dave himself, as a child, played a part.The sets are excellent, particularly the brief post-Katrina glimpse of New Orleans. Dave's house and bait shop are just as we would imagine them. So too are the dingy bars on the back roads of New Iberia. We even get a glimpse of Alafair's three-legged raccoon, Tripod. Four and a half stars for all Burke fans and at least four for everyone else. Now read the book. And then read all the other books.

Many remakes have been done of The Hound of the Baskervilles. None equal this version--not just because of Rathbone and Bruce, but because of the incredible supporting cast: Richard Greene, Wendy Barry, John Carradine, et al. The atmospherics are perfect; the dog is scary and the grimpen mire is practically a character in its own right. This is the Hound against which all others are measured.Terror by Night is also excellent, if you don't mind the miniaturization scenes of the train, which are a tad cheesy.

It is sometimes argued that higher education fails to define and defend itself, that it endlessly asks for resources but neglects to explain the need for those resources and the uses (proper uses, one hopes) that will be made of them.That argument is often made by people who have forgotten the explanations offered in the past. For those who would like to hear the case made both eloquently and authoritatively, I can recommend this book.When Giamatti was made president of Yale he was very young (the youngest president in the university's history) and he had virtually no administrative experience. Nevertheless, he served with great distinction and went on, as most remember, to serve as Commissioner of baseball, prior to his premature death.This book is a collection of his speeches. As such, they carry a certain formality. One can hear the public address system and see the presidential robes in place as he addresses his audiences (many of them student audiences). They are organized around three topics: 1) the nature and purpose of the university; 2) the `earthly use' of a liberal education; and 3) the private university and the public interest. All three are worth the reader's attention; the second is probably the best.While his historic audience is usually some group of Yale stakeholders or students, the actual audience for his thoughts is the educated reader who cares about the state of higher education. He draws on literary materials (his field was renaissance literature) but on many other materials as well. In his talks one senses his impatience with some aspects of the world of the administrator--with the pressures of interest groups, the irrationality of government regulations (his discussion of circular A-21 is a classic) and the need to address such complex issues as the university's multiple relations with industry.His voice is one of moderation. There are predictable bows to liberal shibboleths and a tendency to criticize the positions of Secretary Bennett and professors Hirsch and Bloom (lumping them together unfairly, in my judgment). At the same time there are persuasive criticisms of ideologues of all stripes and a healthy regard for the thought of such thinkers as Edmund Burke.The book offers an educated sensibility. That sensibility is wise, iconoclastic and measured. In many passages it is quite brave. It is good to hear his voice again.

If you are coming to the novel for the first time, relax. It is just what you would expect: beautifully written with wonderful characters, a lean, satisfying plot, a keen sense of place and a charming, but realistic ending. If (like me) you first saw the two cinematic versions, you will not be disappointed in the novel. The Coen brothers' version leaves out a line or two that were memorable in the Henry Hathaway 1969 version, but restores the novel's ending. In many cases, the language in the two films is identical with the language in the novel. There are a few differences in the novel--a bit more texture and description. We learn a tad more about Rooster's early life and the scene with Mattie in the snake pit is longer and more detailed in the novel. Essentially, however, the stories are the same, with the same key scenes and the same set pieces.This is a novel with a strong voice (Mattie's, of course) and a strong supporting cast. Rooster is an iconic character and not just because he was initially played by John Wayne. I prefer elements in the Hathaway film to the Coen brothers' version, but Damon gives a superior performance to Campbell's (as most have remarked) and Kim Darby was a bit old to be playing the 14 year-old Mattie. The key to the story, however, is in the language, in the idiomatic expressions, the rhythms and the classic one-liners. Those are all from Charles Portis' novel and they are gems.If you loved the films you will love the novel. If you never read novels you will love the novel. This is a modern classic, but without weighty themes, symbols or self-conscious narrators. What you see is what you get--a girl with grit out to avenge her father's death at the hands of a lowlife. She gets by with help from a marshal who loves to pull a cork, a Texas ranger proud of his status and a downhome lawyer who could intimidate the O.J. legal team. That's it. Her little brother has a sarcastic sense of humor and her mother is weak in the face of her tasks. It's all up to Mattie and you can rest assured that the vengeance for her father's death will follow as day follows night.

George Pelecanos is an exceptional writer, but Soul Circus is the most powerful novel of his that I have yet read. The third novel in his Derek Strange series, it concerns the jockeying for position of two small-time drug dealers and their mutual interactions with a P.G. County arms dealer. The arms dealer, Strange, and his associate, a white man named Quinn, are all ex-cops. While the story is straightforward, the narrative is multi-layered and richly textured. This is, as always with Pelecanos, a gritty and often grim book, the last possible book desired by the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce. I love its simplicity and clarity. The characters are carefully etched and the ending is as satisfying as it is inevitable. Note to hardcover buyers: this book may still be available on your local remainder shelf.

I liked the second Millennium novel better than the first, but the film of the first novel is more satisfying than the film version of the second. The reason is simple: the first book is far more atmospheric, the second more plot-driven and film is a visual medium. In TGWPWF an investigative journalist and his graduate student girlfriend are working on a project concerning coerced sex workers in Sweden. They take the project to Millennium; Millennium likes it and agrees to publish; suddenly the journalist and his girlfriend are found murdered. The gun used is that of Lisbeth's current 'guardian' and it has her fingerprints on it. Lisbeth investigates independently, while dodging the law; Blomkvist does what he can to stay in contact with her and watch her back. The figure behind the killings and his blond monster assassin/servant are related to Lisbeth in ways that stretch plausibility. Lisbeth gives a good account of herself against both overwhelming and weird antagonists.The good news is that there is more of Lisbeth in the film than in the book, though her relationship with Blomkvist is now so attentuated as to be a lost opportunity. The plot is a bit clunky and the ending somewhat less satisfying than that of TGWTDT. That is not to suggest that you shouldn't see the movie. You should. It's very good. Not superb, but very good. The setting serves fewer purposes here and the focus is on the action. Since the action involves Lisbeth the film is well worth seeing.

Band of Brothers is a 10-part account of the wartime experience of Easy Company, in the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. It begins with their training experience in Georgia and follows them to England, to D-Day in Normandy, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the siege of Bastogne and, eventually, the capturing of Hitler's Eagle Nest headquarters/estate in Bavaria.Featuring Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer, Donnie Wahlberg, et al. the miniseries (based on Stephen Ambrose's book) features the individual experiences of individual characters in separate episodes and contains opening commentary by the characters' real-life counterparts. A sixth disc, containing material on the making of the miniseries, etc. features more interviews with the actual, surviving members of Easy Company.Under the leadership of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the miniseries contains a great deal of realistic footage of the sort seen in Saving Private Ryan. Limbs are severed and the sounds of bullets and shrapnel whizzing through the air are omnipresent. We feel the cold of Bastogne, luxuriate in the beauties of Austria and suffer through the training regimens to which the company is subjected. Watching is not always easy or pleasant, but the emotional impact of the separate episodes is strong.The individual episodes are quite uneven. Some are extremely powerful, e.g., the training episode and the D-Day episode (with stunning use of CGI). Others are less satisfactory. The Bastogne episode, for example, is a long, cold sojourn in foxholes with German artillery and mortar fire shattering trees and shattering bodies. Civilians, however, will obtain a realistic sense of the actual nature of war.The production is courageous in representing the courage of some individuals, the incompetence of others, given the fact that the `characters' represent real people. Given the fact that the narrative is historically accurate, our `wishes' as viewers sometimes go unsatisfied. We want to see much more of Damian Lewis in the role of Dick Winters, for example, but the fact is that Dick Winters was promoted to a battalion position and could not be there, leading Easy Company, for the duration of the miniseries.In general, this is a superb miniseries and the subsidiary material on the sixth disc is excellent. The actual, historical members of Easy Company speak for themselves with great but simple eloquence and their eyes tell a story of war that brings the reality home in ways that films can never quite do.

Theory's Empire is a very important addition to the doorstop-level anthologies dealing with what-in the humanities and soft social sciences-is broadly termed "theory." Subtitled "an anthology of dissent" its editors seek to challenge the conclusions and highlight the shortcomings of a collection of -isms currently practiced within the academy.The high water mark of Theory is now in the past but this anthology is still very much welcome since there is still life left in the dying dragon and-as in the conclusion of the first book of the Faerie Queene-the young need to be warned to keep a prudent distance lest they be harmed by the beast or the 'dragonettes, his fruitfull seede' that may still linger in some hidden nest within the dragon's womb.The contributions include some classic pieces from prior-generation, distinguished commentators such as Ren&eacute; Wellek and M. H. Abrams as well as very recent ones, some written for this volume. There is a little shrillness here and there, but by and large these are not so much 'culture war' attacks as they are substantive criticisms of very real issues, such as Derrida's actual knowledge of modern linguistics or the accuracy of his reading of Saussure. Theory is notorious for its politicization of the academy and it is important to have thoughtful commentators such as Alan Sokal, Russell Jacoby, Todd Gitlin, and Noam Chomsky, whose opposition to aspects of Theory cannot be attributed to their political alignments. Ad hominem smears are common weapons in the Theory arsenal and the editors have sought to immunize themselves against such attacks by including the works of individuals whose credentials, prior associations, and personal body of work cannot be attacked as easily as, e.g., a noticeably conservative, non-academic such as Roger Kimball. The price we pay for this is the absence of pieces by such delicious combatants as Camille Paglia, but given the stakes we pay it.Since this is an anthology of dissent there is more emphasis on the sins and shortcomings of the dying tyrant than on constructive plans for the future, but there are some such plans here and they are interesting and suggestive. For all the talk of popular culture within "cultural studies" it is often so narrow and formulaic in its approach that one is grateful for a piece like Marjorie Perloff's which discusses, among other things, the robust persistence of interest in traditional writers and traditional methods exhibited in actual popular culture on the internet.Nearly every essay is clear and accessible and some (Crews's, e.g.) rise to the level of masterpieces. It is too early to predict the ultimate importance of this collection, but the blog buzz is intense at this point. I do not think it is an overstatement to suggest that it should be read by every practitioner within the humanities and every interested observer who has followed the decline of the humanities and wondered-in the face of the constant contradictions, enormities, self-defeating absurdities and, above all, the endless, dull predictabilities-of Theory how such a collection of ideas and attitudes could ever achieve prominence in the face of evidence, logic, and above all, common sense. It is very reassuring to hear Chomsky say, in effect, that he is at a similar loss and to point out that Theory has never successfully proposed a workable alternative to what can be termed, in shorthand, rationality and the scientific method.

The Amazon reviewers are right. The overwhelming vote is for five stars and each of those stars are deserved. This is the best American TV crime drama since Homicide: Life on the Streets. Damian Lewis, the star, describes it as a dramedy, but this is intelligent crime drama, with very few comic elements. You all know the premise (which is superb): an LAPD detective is convicted of a bloody crime he didn't commit. In prison his bones are broken and his body is slashed (again and again, on both counts). He is eventually vindicated, wins a huge financial settlement and gets his old job back. Now he lives in a furniture-less mansion in the hills with a financial advisor he met in prison. He speaks in zen-like terms, but beneath the surface is a heart crying out for justice and revenge. His partner is a fallen soul as well; she's just gotten out of rehab (the result of an undercover drug assignment that went too far). She's lost her faith. Together they seek justice and personal redemption.The acting is top-of-the-line, the direction very, very special, the scripts consistently excellent. If the Brits made an American show it would be this one. Damian Lewis, of course, is a British actor, suppressing his British accent, `a la Hugh Laurie, and showing the chops of a much older pro.If you haven't discovered Life, do so. The stories are haunting, riveting and wonderful. There is nothing of this quality on American television now. Go for it. (And enjoy a strong supporting cast, with the always reliable Adam Arkin and Robin Weigert--Calamity Jane from Deadwood. She looks different in this role, but she's just as scary.)

My Winnipeg utilizes old fashioned cinematic techniques and achieves a sense of instant freshness. Think of a documentary co-directed by Salvador Dali and David Lynch. My Winnipeg is a dreamlike account of a quirky city's quirky legends. The result is private, personal and utterly stunning. The director describes it as melodrama and he describes melodrama as uninhibited action. In this case the film represents a compilation of uninhibited memories--trenchant, sexy, sometimes bizarre and never dull. If there is a subtext it is that every quirky city is, ultimately, quirky in the same ways. It evokes memories in the mind of a child (or childlike director) and those memories are slightly tilted because the child draws conclusions and infers meaning in different ways than adults do. The result is something more funny, more honest and, sometimes more sad than the representations offered by traditional documentaries. The best way to describe My Winnipeg is to say that it includes elements from classic (particularly early) cinema and utilizes them to create something that feels absolutely new. It's not weird; it's wonderful.

This is a very interesting book on Shakespeare, but it is not really a biography of Shakespeare. As most know, the existing facts of Shakespeare's life are few and far between. Reconstructions of his life consist of something like 5% facts, 45% enlightened inference and 50% guesswork. Greenblatt's inferences are astute and extremely well-informed; the 'fact base', however, is thin and, hence, the material recalcitrant. What Greenblatt has done is situate Shakespeare's work among the events, issues and controversies of his time. He has used those contextual materials to illuminate Shakespeare's work and draw tentative conclusions as to the degree of awareness/involvement of Shakespeare vis `a vis those contexts. In doing so he is probably as successful as one can be. The problems are simple: Shakespeare's body of work is enormous as well as enormously important. He is, however, extremely elusive with regard to his own point of view on key issues. "Guarded" may be a better word, but it is far more difficult to know what Shakespeare thinks of a current issue than, e.g. Spenser or, later, Milton, whose views are clearly articulated.Greenblatt takes a number of salient issues (the succession, the position of the recusants, contemporary Jewry, etc.)and draws connections between those issues and Shakespeare's work. This is very, very suggestive, but it is not 'biographical' in the normal sense. One does not turn to this book for a year-by-year account of Shakespeare's life; such a book--given the available evidence--cannot now be written. The connections which Greenblatt draws, however, are, irreducibly play-specific. We hear a lot about The Merchant of Venice, e.g., comparatively little about a more important work like As You Like It. We hear a lot about Venus and Adonis but very little about a great play like Troilus and Cressida. The issues, in short, drive the discussions and the discussions are superb but, perforce, limited.Greenblatt's knowledge of contemporary law and material culture is impressive. He clarifies many of the 'facts' at our disposal (willing his second-best bed to his wife, e.g.). His knowledge of intellectual and theatrical history are equally impressive. The result is a fine book about Shakespeare, filled with inferences and learned speculation. It is well-written and accessible, free of academic jargon and, for that matter, ideology. It is a wonderful book that many will wish they had written but it is not, ultimately, a biography.

This is the third novel in Collins' 'Road' Trilogy, the first of which was the superb graphic novel, The Road to Perdition. The latter was also an excellent film, though some changes were made in the ending, the original ending being more consistent with the ending of Road to Paradise. Hint: it has to do with the importance of religion in each protagonist's life.Road to Paradise's characters are engaging and the plot is riveting. It is Collins' intention to catch the flavor of 70's Chicago and the 70's mob. The conclusion of the novel involves a mob hit which remains unsolved but is neatly 'solved' in Collins' fictional construct. This is a fine novel, well worth a look.

There is a jacket blurb on The Weight of Glory from John Updike, who comments on both the comfort and pleasure afforded by Lewis. Neither should be underestimated. This is great devotional writing but it is also great writing, writing that is typified by Lewis' ability to deal with the weightiest of matters with a light touch.It is a truism that our faith is reinforced whenever we see it embraced by great minds. Samuel Johnson believed that and it is interesting that Lewis often turns to Johnson for such reinforcement, as we turn to Lewis--one of the indisputably great intellectuals of the twentieth century. Part of that greatness comes from the stark clarity with which Lewis sees important matters. That makes his work accessible; it does not make it simplistic.All of the lay sermons in this volume are trenchant, though 'The Weight of Glory' and 'Learning in War-Time' are exceptional. I especially like 'Is Theology Poetry?' and 'Membership' and find 'Why I Am Not a Pacifist' of particular interest and importance these days.This is a book to be read, embraced, and shared.

While 'The Lovely Bones' deserves a wide audience, this is the one to read. A true crime autobiography, this account of Alice Sebold's rape, identification of her assailant, and depiction of his trial and conviction is a moving and exceptional read. It is a heroic tale, presenting both the heroism of her testimony and the heroism of her tenacity in committing herself to ultimate victory. Painfully honest in its details (principally with regard to the members of her family and their reactions) there is a final sense of collective redemption that parallels that of 'The Lovely Bones.' A powerful debut. Violence enters a sweet and fragile world and ends up wishing it hadn't. Read this book. Bonus: no political correctness here.

The film begins with an interesting premise. A world-class conductor nearly dies from a heart attack, retires from conducting, returns to the Swedish village of his youth and purchases the now vacant local school building. He becomes the director of the local church choir and is drawn back into the world of 'conducting' but on different terms. This time he will seek the beauty of music without the pressures and competitiveness of international concert halls. The setting is nicely realized, as the seasons change (mirroring the changes in the man) and there may even be some love in store for him.So what's wrong with this picture? (Caution: SPOILERS ahead.)What's wrong is that the film is built on every conceivable romantic (as in academic romanticism) cliche. The village churchman is a heavily-repressed pornography reader who is unable to respond to his more human and down to earth wife. One of the village men is a former bully/current wife beater, who attempts to control his wife at every turn (while the conductor composes a song for her about personal freedom in which she will sing the solo and drive her trogladyte husband up the wall).The subtexts are: everyone is good at heart (except they aren't, here). Community is beautiful (except that this community includes some classic lowlifes and no visible police force until the film's end). Expression trumps skill. The heart is more important than the head. Performing music on a grand, highly professional level will kill you (literally wear out your heart, in the film's words).The conductor uses squirrely techniques to inspire his choir. They dance, hold hands, emote, etc. He tells them that the music is in the air and they must somehow draw it down and reify it. The film ends at a music festival in Austria. Unfortunately there is no elevator in the building and the conductor must climb the stairs, thus risking another heart attack. He collapses in the men's room, his face bloodied when his head bounces off the plumbing pipes and radiator. Slumped on the floor he tries to wipe the blood from his face by employing used towels from the waste paper bin. Eventually he hears the voices of his choir through a grate; the choir's voices inspire the members of the audience. Everyone is elevated by song. Community is restored. The conductor dies happily, sitting on the floor of a men's toilet.If you want to have your romantic ideology reinforced, with several dollops of sentimentality and some brief nudity, this is the picture you will not want to miss. The good news is that there are some lovely moments in the film, nice cinematography and a fine performance by Michael Nyqvist. The alteration of a few scenes and a dash of realism here and there would have made for a fine film rather than a preachy, predictable one.

This is essentially Hitchcock light, but it's still well worth seeing. John Thaw plays a failed British businessman who is serving as caretaker for a friend's house on Rhodes. He meets a woman; they go to bed; she disappears; he's arrested. Then he's let go but told to stay on the island. His passport is confiscated, but, fortunately, he has an Irish passport as well and leaves. Hence the Hitchcock plot: an average, but decent man is sucked into something he doesn't understand. He must call on all his resources to find the truth and protect his freedom. The plot works; the production values are high; the ending more or less plausible. The interesting plot twist is that all eyes are focused on the friend whose house the Thaw character, Harry Barnett, is protecting. He has to be the guilty man. Or does he? Harry doesn't believe he is, though everyone else in the story does. Thus Harry not only protects himself; he protects his friend in the face of the evidence. And the friend is a tad sleazoid, which adds further conflict to the tale. It's all done very well, with superb British character actors and nice location shots on Rhodes, in Cambridge, London and what purports to be Dorset (but looks more like Cornwall). This is not North by Northwest, but it's a solid story that's done expertly.

There are many books available on the GI Bill, each with its own strengths. This is the best that I have read to date. It is comprehensive in its treatment of the subject, exploring not just the minute details of the bill's passage and the terms of its provisions, but looking as well to the larger historic and cultural implications of the act.In Peter Drucker's view the GI Bill was the most important event of the twentieth century because of its wider implications: it ushered in the information age and the information society. Bennett is aware of views such as this and he presents the bill in the context of its related events: the growth of suburbia, the creation of the interstate highway system, the expansion of the middle class and the permanent alteration of American higher education. He even explores such details as the resulting growth in the number of medical specialists (since there were more general practitioners than were needed after the war, doctors turned to other opportunities and other areas of interest).Bennett is a reporter not an academic historian, but he combines the academic historian's tenacity in searching for the elusive detail with a journalist's desire to write a good story with human `interest'. This is not so much a journalist's book as a historian's, since Bennett takes the long view and positions his subject within larger contexts. It does, however, have the freshness and lucidity of the best journalistic writing.The GI Bill changed America in a host of ways; Bennett explores them very ably.Highly recommended.

The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world. The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena. To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition. Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically. The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations. All in all, this is a nice film. I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.

This time Joe is in southern Wisconsin. His client has learned that a man with whom she had a one-night stand has not only been arrested for murder, but has confessed to committing that murder, the murder having occurred during the time that they were together.She is fair and public-spirited; her sense of justice is outraged. She hires Joe to investigate the case. Joe does and he untangles a web of vicious violence and all-encompassing criminality. It isn't easy for him to do so, since the young man who has confessed to the crime refuses to explain why or, for that matter, even talk to him. He is either protecting someone or he is afraid of someone. What if the person he is protecting is complicit in the murder? What if those he is afraid of decide to put Joe in their sights?Joe is not going to allow him to pay for a crime he did not commit, even if Joe is endangered in the process. As Joe will learn, the individuals with whom he is dealing are without remorse and without scruple. They are prepared to inflict hideous pain and they will enjoy doing so.Not a fragrant world, as Raymond Chandler would say, but it's Joe's world and, fortunately, he is ready for it. And Flesh and Blood So Cheap is not for the faint-hearted. This is hard-boiled to the point that there's precious little water left in the pan after justice is sought and attained.This is Joe Hannibal at his best. Prime crime fiction. Feast on it.

All people of good will recognize that there are two meanings of the word diversity. Thus, Peter Wood speaks of diversity and (italicized) diversity, the latter being code for a set of beliefs and attitudes that have replaced the threatened concept of "affirmative action". The italicized diversity may be a wholesome and benevolent concept but it does not represent actual diversity. Thus, as Wood notes, institutions such as Wellesley, Smith and Bryn Mawr champion the importance of "diversity" while they exclude men. The actual diversity of the workplace includes individuals who are litigious, lazy and combative, but when companies say that they value diversity they mean something quite different. Similarly, while the academy may value and celebrate diversity it seldom exemplifies it in key areas of human thought such as political orientation.Wood's book provides the historical backdrop for the emergence of "diversity," principally in Justice Powell's opinion in the Bakke case, which involved a colorblind interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment but included agreement that race could be taken into account as a factor in an admissions program, not as the decisive factor but insofar as the race of a black applicant contributed to an institution's diversity. With that door open, the notion of diversity has become pivotal in later case law and, indeed, throughout our academic and corporate culture. The latter, interestingly, was advanced dramatically by a 1987 report entitled Workforce 2000 from the Hudson Institute.That report garbled some key demographic statistics and suggested that by the year 2000 the percentage of white males entering the labor force would be 15%. Hence the need to change the contemporary universities' way of doing business so that a diverse array of graduates would have the preparation to meet America's corporate needs. The percentage at the time of the report was 47%. The (muddled and mistaken) drop to 15% was reported throughout the media and given considerable attention. The actual number in 2000 was 45.6%.Wood's survey of the "diversity" concept is historical, with particular attention given to the law, to the academy, to culture and to commerce. It is rich in its examples and often humorous in its tone. Those who have disagreed with some of its conclusions or analysis have acknowledged that it is exceptionally well written and a very enjoyable read.I would note that Wood is an anthropologist and that his training and credentials provide him with a unique outlook on an issue that has been discussed from other perspectives but seldom from that of a professional anthropologist. The book is learned and important, but written with a light touch that all readers will appreciate.Highly recommended.

Jeff Shannon's online, Amazon editorial review says it all. He's nailed it. Just a word of advice. When you watch the movie on this dvd you absolutely must activate the subtitles. Otherwise you will not have a clue as to what is being said for approximately 75% of the dialogue. The genre and Michael Mann style all speak, of course, but if you want the actual words as well you've got to get them at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, the movie is like a Dick Tracy story in which every character should be named Mumbles.

This glossy, engaging miniseries is a succession of interconnected revenge stories within the mobile phone industry. The pacing is swift, the look is smart and current and the production values are high. Most important, the show features the wonderful Michael Kitchen, who appears in (and dominates) the final two episodes. Each of the four episodes is approximately 50 minutes in length--perfect for home viewing--but be warned, once you start you won't want to stop. The story is told from multiple perspectives, as if it were a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces being fitted in different ways. Each time that parts of the story are retold we learn more about the actual events and the motivations behind them. This is very nice work, with superb performances, a slick script and a nice blend of background music, noise, titles, quick cuts between scenes--the whole magilla. This is not the Britain that you see depicted in the posters on the travel agents' walls. This is high stakes industrial Britain, where the champagne flows, major-league scores are settled and blood is spilled in serious quantities. Go for it.

London's Met has officers at the rank of Commander overseeing large case loads in selected areas. These commanders are aided by retired senior officers who help them work the files and the cases. (Think "New Tricks" but without any smiles or humor.) The author of the series, Lynda LaPlante, toyed with the idea of focusing on the area of Terrorism but settled instead on the area of Murder. A Murder Commander would handle approximately 140 cases at a time. There are few women commanders in the Met--4 at the time that LaPlante began the series. Her Murder Commander, Clare Blake, is played to a fare-thee-well by Amanda Burton.Clare is smart, bureaucratically-savvy, tough and comfortable in her role. Unfortunately for her, she is impulsive. Her principal problem--which looms over the first three episodes (approximately 7 hours of programming)--concerns her affair with a man she once arrested for murder. He claims to be rehabilitated and an upstanding citizen, but bodies are turning up and he's in everyone's frame but Clare's. The murderer is played by Hugh Bonneville; yes, the Earl of Grantham himself, flashing some nude backside and exhibiting some deviant behaviors.Within the supporting cast there is a faithful old copper who is in love with Clare, though she capitalizes on his loyalty without reciprocating his love; an ambitious young constable newly promoted to inspector, with whose partner the Commander occasionally sleeps; and, finally, a male DCI (played by Matthew Marsh) with whom Clare continually clashes. He would love to see her brought down, but when the going gets tough he realizes that they both need one another. The dynamic between the two of them is superb.Think: Prime Suspect, but with raging hormones, more bureaucratic in-fighting, more human frailty, more bending of the Met's rules (and of the law) but with equally fine writing and equally fine performances. This is a little less heroic, a little more realistic, but always engaging and entertaining. The stories are based on real occurrences, the production values very high. Welcome to New Scotland Yard.

Black Mask is the Nathan/Mencken project which succeeded their magazine, Smart Set. The little black mask logo had been part of the iconography of Smart Set, so that the transition was easy. Black Mask brought together the pantheon of crime writers, though it also included western stories and other category writing ultimately traceable to the romance. The contributors represent a who's who of crime writing: Hammett, Chandler, Gardner, McCoy, Whitfield, et al. but there is also the delicious Carroll John Daly, sometimes said to be the first person to develop the hardboiled style. There is a complete run of Black Mask at the UCLA research library, for those in the area who want to browse. Individual numbers often come on the market; those with Chandler stories are particularly prized (and priced accordingly).Nolan's book is very useful, in that it provides a history of the magazine, with due attention to the editorial handiwork of 'Cap' Shaw, headnotes on the principal writers and samples of their work. It also includes bibliographical material and addenda material such as a list of Black Mask's competitors.Highly recommended.

This is a stunning piece of historiography--not stunning in the sense that its thesis comes as a totally-unexpected surprise, but stunning in the sense that it carries such plausibility and has not been argued before at any length. The use of historical evidence is impressive, the utilization of broad contextual information even more impressive.The long and the short of it is that Pickett's charge (or, as it is sometimes termed, Longstreet's assault) was only part of Lee's plan for the third day of fighting at Gettysburg. The plan included, among other things, a coordinated double movement, with Pickett's division attacking the center of the Union forces from the front and Stuart's cavalry attacking from the rear. Stuart was to disable the Union artillery, perhaps even utilize it to fire canister into the Union infantry behind the stone wall. The combination of the two (with other elements keeping the Union flanks engaged) would split the Union forces on Cemetery Ridge and enable the Confederate forces to chop them up piecemeal. This was not to be, however, for Stuart's forces faced the much smaller forces of the recently-promoted George Armstrong Custer, who mounted a bold and courageous frontal assault which kept Stuart from ever making it to Cemetery Ridge.Carhart builds the plausibility of his case by tracing Lee's general patterns of behavior--principally his risk-taking and his secretiveness. He anchors the argument for a particular plan, by examining the cognate victories of Hannibal, Frederick the Great and Napoleon--all of which Lee would have known intimately. He also attributes Custer's victory, in part, to Custer's awareness of the strategy used by Alexander the Great against the much larger forces of Darius' Persians.This is wonderful stuff--revisionist history of one of the most important battles in American military history (a battle that had previously been studied to near death) and history that is embedded in a dramatic narrative with technical details explained with the utmost lucidity.Very highly recommended.

Crime Beat has not been welcomed warmly by Amazon reviewers. Essentially a collection of newspaper articles by Connelly the crime reporter, it lacks the attractions of his novels and, indeed, of true crime writing. True crime writing, of course, draws on the strengths and strategies of fictional narrative, while newspaper articles are basically accounts of something that has happened, what people are saying about it and what individuals are doing about it. Succeeding articles offer updated information, but, again, lack the overarching narrative, Aristotelian plot, narrative 'world', detailed aspects of setting, rounded characters and other aspects found in novels and true crime writing.Hence, Connelly's Crime Beat offers a nice instructional opportunity for those wishing to draw clear lines of distinction between journalistic writing--with its palpable limits--and larger narratives. In Connelly's case, one can also look at stories that began as real events and later served as the basis for those larger narratives. And that is about it. I am not surprised that some readers have admitted to abandoning the book after reading fifty or sixty pages. This is something different and, ultimately, not as interesting, compelling or engaging as one of Michael Connelly's novels. It does have its uses, but those will not be of interest or utility to most readers.

Despite some of the misgivings in the editorial reviews you should not hesitate to buy and read this book. One of Kellerman's hallmarks is his consistency. The only weak character here is Robin and she is ongoing in her weakness. Why would Alex tolerate her betrayals? This is implausible. Plus, she is smarmy, like Spenser's Dr. Silverman. In each case, their dogs are always more interesting characters. Milo is dependably Milo; Petra is a welcome addition to the group in the recent novels, and Alex really gets a chance to play Alex, making concrete psychological judgments and handling a disorder that is of broad human interest.The plot is complex but intelligible and the ultimate conclusion is satisfying. Handling the exposition and investigation through dialogue is perfectly OK, so long as you like the participants in the dialogue and what's not to like here?Alex's patient and her physicist boyfriend are both interesting characters and the dysfunctional adults are sufficiently interesting to hold your attention. Jonathan Kellerman's writing seldom tends toward the extremes; his watchword is steadiness and evenness. OBSESSION is fine; go for it.

DEATH BY HOLLYWOOD is a nice confection served up by a writer who knows his way around the kitchen. The plot works, the characters are stereotypical (we'd be disappointed if they weren't) and the narrative is laced with jokes and anecdotes. There is something about Hollywood that leads to spicy anecdotes and off-center quotes. Part of it is the get-rich-quick/get-poor-quick ethos; part of it is the argot of Jewish moguls from the east who ran an industry that was unfamiliar but which they came to understand in their own way; part of it is the trove of stories that undergird every new story. Whatever it is, Bochco understands it and taps into it. This is a quick read and good fun.

The good news is that Susan is out of town, at a conference in North Carolina. The bad news is that except for a passing reference to him, Hawk does not appear in this novel. The further bad news is that though Susan is out of town there is still some cutesy-poo talk about her. Aside from all that, the story and the prose are lean and crisp and to the point.As I've written elsewhere, Parker has said that he has more to say about Spenser than Hawk because he doesn't know Hawk as well. How this could be the case, when Parker created him, I don't know, but it's a pity. A Hawk-less Spenser novel can still function effectively (as this one does), but it's like a well made cake without any icing.

Whenever I have reservations about an award-winning piece I question whether or not there's something wrong with me. In this case I concluded that I have little patience for something unconventional which is not entertaining. Caught on a Train is surely unconventional, but I found it to be tedious and extremely claustrophobic. The bulk of the action occurs on a crowded train, at a crowded newstand, in a crowded compartment and in a crowded dining car. In the subsidiary material on the DVD, the author informs us that the initial inspiration for the film was an unpleasant train trip which he took with his wife. The wife is eliminated from the plot here for dramatic purposes, but the unpleasantness remains. Commentators (some of whom I very much admire) like the film because it is 'different'. That is insufficient for me. None of the characters here are likeable; the setting is oppressive (not just on the crowded, dirty, noisy, smoky train, but with the omnipresent lead-gray skies across the relatively barren landscape through which the train moves); the plot is lugubrious and the themes (generational differences and unexpected commonalities) insufficient to redeem the rest of it. I love Michael Kitchen and Peggy Ashcroft and I think Waiting for Godot is profound, moving, at times funny and ultimately uplifting. Caught on a Train is Waiting for Godot without the fun and the setting for the latter, with a single leaf on a bare tree in the second act is paradisal compared with this train from hell.

As all avid readers of Steve Martini know, there was a delay in this book's publication. It was well worth waiting for, perhaps Martini's best to date. Readers love courtroom drama and within genre fiction courtroom drama is always in short supply. Also, Martini's prose is becoming smoother with age, though his editor might have made some pertinent suggestions that would have reduced the (few) clunker lines of dialogue and description.The plot turns on a government computer plot which is both engaging and plausible and--perhaps with a nod to Wilkie Collins and the roots of mystery fiction--Martini includes a piece of art glass whose loss adds a neat mini- subplot. The legal maneuvering is impeccable and Madriani's thrusts and parries in cross examination are exquisite. This is Martini's real turf and he is a master of his domain. I kept thinking of an old line from Scaramouche. In the midst of a desperate fight his opponent informs him that he is the greatest swordsman in France. The rejoinder: "The Italian masters taught me a thing or two." Martini is the Italian master.

In classical antiquity poetic art was divided into three broad categories: lyric, dramatic, and epic. The novel descends from the epic, though it seldom resembles it. Also in antiquity, authors scaled the genre ladder, beginning with pastoral and georgic and eventually moving on to epic. Don Winslow, like James Ellroy, has followed a parallel path, beginning with traditional genre fiction and moving on to something far more ambitious, in Winslow's case something that is epic in aspiration, if not in all of its specific elements. The sometimes incantatory nature of epic is here replaced with a narrative that, while complex, is always crystal clear and lightning fast.This is a book that is daring in its size and scope and equally daring in its models and antecedents. The protagonist's obsessions with evil and his willingness to conquer it at any personal cost is explicitly Melvillean. Winslow's tracing of the connections between the evils of North and South America in an ethos of revolution and counterrevolution is explicitly Conradian, though The Power of the Dog is realized on an even grander scale than Conrad's masterpiece, Nostromo.There have been concerns expressed about his criticism of American policies and actions, but while they are there they must also be seen in terms of the first dictate of the noir gospel: large organizations, be they crime families, unions, companies, or governments threaten the individual and the small degree of happiness and integrity that is possible in the world that they have wrought is seldom available except through limited, personal relationships. Personal loyalty is the summum bonum in this world and it drives the narrative in The Power of the Dog.The historical sweep and detail is impressive, even though there is a lapse here and there. The M60 machine gun, e.g., fires the standard 7.62 NATO round, not a 50 calibre round. These are small matters in the face of Winslow's accomplishment--an instant classic, one of the top crime novels of our time. Don't fear its physical weight; the pages flip by like a hydrofoil on a sea of blood.

For those who love to enjoy the art of a fine craftsman, this will be seen as beautiful work. In a sense it is Ellroy-esque. The focus is on a set of urban police officers, each special, each very different. They are drawn together by a specific case, but their personal back stories are as engaging as the case and the resolution of the case constitutes a set of mini-redemptions. The difference is that the prose is more traditional and the officers are all, in their way, good people. What we have here is a character-driven mystery that is beautifully plotted and beautifully executed--a genre bender that all readers will appreciate. Though dark, it is not as dark as some of Pelecanos' other work. As in Ellroy's work, the District of Columbia functions as an essential narrative element, not simply as the novel's setting. I recommend this highly. Give it to your friends who read mainstream fiction and 'don't usually care for mysteries'. Then watch their mouths fall open.

This is an interesting, but sometimes curious book. Cathy Small, an anthropology professor at Northern Arizona University, used her sabbatical for a `field experiment'. She enrolled as a freshman at her university, moved into a dormitory, took classes and studied university life from the true `inside'. The results were invariably interesting though not always counter-intuitive.She learned that students value the total collegiate experience more than that experience's academic center. She learned that they are somewhat more serious than she first anticipated. She learned that a large number cheat, though the `cheating' is conceived in various ways. Some see it, for example, as part of the game, like a runner on second base's expected attempts to steal the catcher's signs.Some of what she learned seems to be the result of considerable naivet&eacute;. She is struck, for example, by the look of the campus at eye- or bus window-level. While she can park anywhere, as a faculty member, the students are restricted to the peripheries of the campus and must traverse large portions of the campus on foot or by bus. At the same time--with these restrictions--there seems to be an uncommon amount of traffic on campus. The reason? Students are calling people on their cell phones and asking them to pick them up.As an anthropologist she has a sharp eye for cultural details, but as an anthropologist she tends to become immersed in some of those details to the exclusion of others. For example, she spends a great deal of time studying the messages and cartoons that students affix to their doors and does a gender-based content analysis of them. Fine, but do students read anything beyond required class materials?She notices that the resident assistants within the dorms are at pains to develop a sense of hall community. They organize comedy nights, lay on food for the communal watching of televised sports and films, and so on. Nevertheless, few of the dorm residents attend these functions. Why? Because the students have their own televisions and a small network of friends; they do not participate in communal events. This is very interesting, but the author does not make the corollary point that universities offer students `services' which the students are forced to pay for, but which the students do not actually use. How do they feel about that?In a closing chapter, the author explores a host of important issues regarding college costs. One is the increase of `administrators'. The real growth, however (240% vs. 81% for line administrators), is in nonteaching `academic staff', including the dormitory hand holders whom she described. At no point does she question her fellow students concerning these `services', their contribution to rising tuition costs and the students' actual desire (or disdain) for such services. Similarly, she talks about other aspects of college life and cost, e.g., the fact that enrolment in liberal arts and science majors have been halved (or worse), while the `professional' degrees have multiplied (business, education, and so on). It is clear that students are now more `vocational' than in the past. How do they feel about that? Do they worry about that, at a time when we are routinely told that we are all likely to have not only multiple jobs, but multiple careers? Is a vocational major actually a great risk rather than a safe thing?She is aware of the degree of indebtedness that students are incurring but she does not discuss this with them. Are they aware that one cannot erase student loans by filing for bankruptcy? Do they think about the fact that when they are extending their college time to 6 years (the standard number used for `completion' percentages) that they are not only investing two more years of their lives but also foregoing two more years of potential income?Curiously, she makes a great deal of the fact that students face challenges with regard to time management. These challenges are exacerbated by their need to work (generally ca. 10 hours per week). Why is this a revelation to a person who not only successfully completed college but also successfully completed doctoral work? In the same connection, she notes that the students often work in order to be able to afford luxuries, not simply to pay for basic necessities. How do they feel about that? Do they perceive that colleges (trying to `be like businesses') are providing quality of life facilities in lieu of, in many cases, tenure-track faculty? Is that a problem or are they fine with that?I think that all people involved with academic life will profit from reading this book. All will learn something or see something familiar in a fresh way. Unfortunately, they may also be frustrated (as I was) that the author didn't take this interesting and important opportunity and use it to explore some of the cultural and policy issues which threaten higher education, issues which she enumerates but does not confront.

The Band's Visit is well described on Amazon's main page. An Egyptian band comes to Israel to play at an Arab culture center in a small town. They arrive at the wrong town and spend the night there, waiting for the next day's bus to take them to their performance site. In the meantime almost nothing happens, except that the Egyptians and the Israelis learn of their common humanity. Nothing 'happens', but they learn everything. The film is sweet, funny, heart-rending at times and cinematically perfect. Each group has its representative figures, the predictability of the varieties of the human spirit underscoring their true humanity and deep commonality. The film has been subjected to some political slings and arrows since there are both Israeli and Palestinian actors working together here. When the director was asked about this, at Ebertfest, he responded that his job is to create art and he has no time for politics such as this. This was the perfect answer. The film is deeply 'political' because it is deeply human, something for which the deeply political often have little time. The performances are very special and the film's warmth and beauty transcends the stark, lonely landscape in which they are revealed. This little film is now the largest-grossing Israeli film every exhibited in America. See it.

The MWA handbook, Writing Mysteries, is one of the best of the how-to books for aspiring mystery writers. Each chapter is written by a well-known professional and each important part of the activity is covered: preparation/research, the essential elements (character, setting, plot, etc.), subgenres and practical advice on markets, interactions with agents and editors and writing practices. There is also some bibliographical material (the `best of the genre'; reference books, etc.).How useful the book will be to individual writers depends on the writers. Broad experience as a reader, in my opinion, trumps the advice of a ten-page chapter. In other words, a broad reader could write the chapters here, once he or she thought about the issues under consideration. If you are not a broad reader it is unlikely that a set of encapsulated recommendations will be sufficient to introduce you to the mystery/crime fiction genres and the diverse ways in which highly-skilled writers practice their craft.I would normally argue that there are certain things that can only be learned through long practice: plot architectonics, tone, pace, e.g., but some of my students have been able to do these things `naturally' in ways that surprise and even mystify me. Other things can only be learned by experience--things which I call `lore' rather than `learning'. Writing Mysteries is very helpful in this regard, with, e.g., a nice chapter by Ruth Cavin on the ways and means of the NY editor's office.I would recommend that Writing Mysteries (and similar books) be used like the bible: read in it; read around in it. There is information here and there is inspiration as well. Some material will be of great use to one writer, but not to another. Sometimes it is good for all of us to be reminded of essentials. Sometimes we will learn much more from an offhand comment or random insight than from a nearly-exhaustive examination of a subject.I advise my own students to read widely in internet material, particularly that in which successful authors discuss their views of their work and talk specifically about the manner in which that work was created. Each approach (like each author) is unique, though there are commonalities. The ultimate goal is to nurture your own, specific talent, but learning the techniques and attitudes of others can be very suggestive and sometimes enable you to work through a problem or issue that you are confronting. In seeing how some `do it' we learn how we ourselves actually `do it'. That enables us to see our own particular strengths and capitalize on them. There is no successful `way', only the way that works for you. Writing Mysteries may help you find that way (or find your way back to it).

This is a delightful little book, particularly so if you want to have your prejudices confirmed. Those prejudices would include the following: 1) Theory should never become detached from practice; 2) Elites who think they know what is best for the common folk are never to be trusted; 3) Europe is different from America and we should neither be intimidated by their culture nor excessively defensive concerning our own; 4) Ugliness--regardless of the political ideology supporting it--is still ugly; 5) Common sense and common aspiration trump hothouse academic posturing; 6) Architecture is space for human life, not an opportunity to make an abstract statement; 7) (my personal prejudice) Art deco (on the large scale) and prairie-style (domestically) so far exceed modernist or postmodernist architecture that one must wonder why they were ever abandoned.Tom Wolfe's purpose here is to demonstrate that establishment architecture (which happened to also be left-leaning, ideological, elitist architecture) is flat-out ugly. While he shows the linear progression of influences that led to the international style and sustained it, he never fully answers the question of why so many tolerated this nonsense for so long.I have had some personal dealings with one of the individuals in TW's rogues' gallery and I found him to be arrogant, pretentious, highhanded and not terribly imaginative. How do such individuals prosper? TW's answer, in part, is that they draw their actual living from university appointments rather than from real world construction projects, but he also argues that, in general, the consumer simply defers to such a person's judgment rather than following his own lights. Thus, one of the key lessons of the book is to trust yourself and your own inclinations and perceive the nudity of the elite culture's current emperors--a healthy antidote to many persisting cultural diseases.

Bugliosi is in high dudgeon here, but not without considerable justification. A book urged on him by his Norton editor, the tone is that of a conversation between author and reader, with copious asides and personal reflections. Bugliosi is outraged by the incompetence of the prosecution, the mendacity of the defense, the palpable guilt of the defendant, the many flagrant mistakes of the judge and the flawed and fawning reportage of the media. He is angry and he displays his anger with a rush of charges, examples, and--in bold type--examples of how he himself would have argued the case.The book is not an unrelieved phillipic and Bugliosi takes the time to weigh, e.g., the degree of guilt that should be assigned and the degree of victimhood which should be appreciated in the case of a subsidiary figure such as Mark Fuhrman. Ultimately this is a book about our system of justice, which Bugliosi admires, but also the pathetic level of minimal competence (or maximum incompetence) with which those who are part of that system turn and grind its wheels.Though not a point-by-point history of the Simpson case and trial, the book reviews the individuals and the evidence which were at its core. If you have ever been nonplussed by our system of justice, read this book for confirmation of your own feelings. If you want a pointed and reasonably comprehensive review of the case and trial, read this book. Expect some fresh insight, but do not expect a vast amount of new evidence. And yes, O.J. did it. The evidence is indisputable.

This is a model biography--an account of an iconic figure who has attracted broad interest, who exemplifies key aspects of his times and continues to command affection and respect. The problem with Wyatt Earp, of course, is that the true story is now covered with legend, lie, half-truth and a long list of beliefs and impressions instilled by films and a television series.The author peels back the myths and legends, studies the available facts and documentary evidence and delivers a detailed portrait anchored in reality. The result is different from what some will expect, but it is no less fascinating and Wyatt is no less interesting or (with due regard to contemporary realities) praiseworthy. The book is particularly interesting in the ways in which it sketches period detail. The extensive accounts of lawsuits, criminal prosecutions and newspaper wars help to fill in the background and give a sense of the cultural world/whirl in which Wyatt lived.The ancillary characters are also given their due: Doc Holliday, Johnny Behan, Curly Bill Brocius, Ike Clanton, Texas Jack Vermillion, Turkey Creek Johnson, Mattie, Sadie, the Earps--Jim, Warren, Virgil, Morgan, et al. This will be particularly interesting to fans of the superb film, Tombstone, who will learn that many of the characters there were real, but some of the actions (Doc's killing Johnny Ringo) were not.The jacket review blurb states that `the facts are more interesting than the legend' and this turns out to be true. Who knew of Wyatt's early preference for ice cream over rotgut and busthead? Who knew that Morgan was truly an exceptional pool player? Who knew what Sadie Marcus actually looked like in her maturity? (Hint: not like Dana Delaney)The author is a newspaper man and is particularly adept at evaluating the worth of newspaper accounts. (Who knew that the events in Tombstone were covered extensively by the San Francisco papers [because of the investors living there]?) The book is carefully researched and very well written. At key points it has all of the suspense and momentum of a fine film. Highly recommended for all general readers, but particularly for students of the west and our cultural history.

This is a first-rate book. I cut it a half-star because the plot lacks the punch of his 5-star second novel, SONGS OF INNOCENCE. This is the result of planning, not writing. There are simply not enough characters left on stage to create (first) the mystification and (second) the jaw-dropping surprise. You will see what I mean when you read it (as you very much should).The strength of the book lies in the fact that Aleas (an alias, as you probably already know) has captured the ethos of noir perfectly and he has updated its language, so that there is no datedness or camp, but rather solid, contemporary noir with a central voice that is wise as well as world-weary at the ripe old age of 29.This new voice in crime fiction is one that should be heard. Read this book first and then be prepared to be astonished by the second.

The vast majority of books on higher education over the last decade have pointed to serious problems, serious failings and serious challenges. With the exception of a book like Jonathan Cole's The Great American University (which indicates the vast accomplishments of America's premier research universities), most commentators have significant criticisms which they wish to lodge.Jim Nelson Black's book is no exception. Indeed, much of what he says is true, but he pushes his arguments to the point that they verge on screeds. We have seen screeds from the left, screeds from the right and `revelatory' screeds that inform us that all professors are lazy sots who need to be put back to work, once they have been denuded of their tenure and slapped around a bit.Black's book is on the right end of the spectrum. It looks at a host of issues which are causes for concern (diminished core curricula, political indoctrination, tenured radicals, reduced standards, a corporate antipathy to religion, the sponsoring (or at least the countenancing) of behaviors that were once seen to be immoral, and so on. These are issues which merit attention. They also need to be subjected to analysis. Black's views tend toward the monolithic. The extremes (which can be identified) are seen as the dominant--everywhere, in all times and in virtually every case.He does give some shoutouts to alternatives--George's Madison program at Princeton, the Directed Studies program at Yale, the recognition by prominent conservatives who are also highly reputable academics (Donald Kagan, Harvey Mansfield, et al.) that there are some conservative voices crying in the wilderness and some challenges to leftist orthodoxy--but the book does not go out of its way to analyze the problems in detail. It remains, largely, a lamentation.Lamentations have their place. This will give heart to those who felt that no one else was of like mind and it will bedevil the left by beating them, unrelievedly, about the head and shoulders. To change, however, to persuade those on the left, right and in the middle that we have lost our way, requires hard facts along with common sense. We need to enlist all possible voices in the effort. There are thinkers on the left, e.g., who are equally concerned about many of these issues and there are thinkers across the political spectrum who will, for example, applaud "access" to higher education but be willing to listen to the facts concerning graduation rates, debt levels, default rates and the other hard realities that lie below the rosy surfaces of platitudes and political pieties.This is a book designed, essentially, to alarm and that is important. It is less effective in that task, however, when it seems to scrupulously tell only one side of the story. The author's intention is to bring about change and to spark such change by creating alarm. That is fine, but we need a more detailed sense of the current condition (there are plenty of reasons for alarm) and a program for change that will enlist the numbers necessary to actually bring it about.

This is an exceptional guide to all things Hollywood. It is particularly important for screenwriters, but it is useful as well for novelists. It describes the movie industry, the television business, the individuals who create art and entertainment, their culture, lifestyle and language. There is a particularly useful chapter on the process of moving a screenplay from the author's imagination to its actual production and a chapter on the geography of southern California.In addition to its usefulness as a history, a guide and a how-to book, it is also very helpful as a reference book. It is filled with information on Tinseltown offices and institutions, with addresses and phone numbers provided. There are three glossaries of Hollywood terms: professional terms, production terms and slang.This is a book that will enrich the experience of filmgoers; at the same time it is a perfect guide for student writers and aspiring filmmakers. Since it was published in 1998, some of the material is now out of date, but this book tells you what to look for; the internet can supplement it with current addresses and current phone numbers.I would also recommend (as John Morgan Wilson does), William Goldman on Hollywood, Syd Field on Screenwriting and Mike Davis on Los Angeles. He provides a fulsome list of other titles. Check them out.

First the caveats. This is not a play; it is a novel. This is not an allegory; it is a realistic narrative. This is not about everyman; it is about a specific individual. Everyman is not a secularized Jewish New Yorker with a brother worth $50,000,000, three wives, and the opportunity to have hot sex with a Danish model. The life of the unnamed protagonist does, however, link with common aspects of human experience in striking and sometimes profound ways.There are three major themes. The first is the exploration of the Scottish proverb that (put more decorously) an aroused male member has no conscience. When it follows its impulses the results are often ultimately unpleasant. The second, more important theme, is the illustration of Yeats's notion that as we age we increasingly feel as if our hearts--sick with desire--are "fastened to a dying animal." The book is a meditation on death, but more particularly a meditation upon the ways in which our bodies (some of our bodies; the protagonist's brother is healthy as well as rich) fail and betray us. The third is the importance of family and friends, but particularly family--a nexus of relationships that we see as important when we stop being selfish and begin to be wise.The story is beautifully written, beautifully plotted, beautifully realized. It is grim but neither hollow nor depressing, erotic but not lurid. Most of all it is rich in details and descriptions. Highly recommended.

Diane Ravitch is one of the nation's experts on education, particularly K-12. Her history of American education from the postwar period until 1980 is, thus, a must-read for students of the subject.This is a period of massive change, encompassing as it does the civil rights movement, the vast changes in higher education which followed the passage of the GI Bill, the conflicts brought by, in shorthand, `the sixties', the open education movement which followed on the progressive movement and the resulting back to basics movement. This is the period of Sputnik and that in which a Department of Education was established.The book is excellent on the details of the specifics, e.g. the Brown decision, and the author is capable of taking us through, day by day, step by step, speech by speech of, e.g., the occupation of Straight Hall at Cornell or the complex details of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. In this, she makes some choices. She says next to nothing about the bombing of Sterling Hall at the University of Wisconsin, e.g. and, in my judgment, gives comparatively short shrift to the lessons learned from the GI Bill.Nevertheless, the discussion of key historical actions and moments is exhaustive. In my opinion, however, the book is long on description and comparatively short on analysis. This is not to say that she fails to understand the issues. She understands the issues in detail and what she gains in balance, moderation and a fair depiction of the facts and issues is considerable. At the core, however, there is a lack of passion with regard to the consequences of the individual events. I purchased a used copy through an Amazon affiliate and one of the previous reader's marginalia revealed an ongoing attempt to determine what the author approved of and what she found wanting.I applaud the author's attempt to be open and balanced, but as she herself says at the book's conclusion, the entire history of the period is encompassed by a core question:The issue, which echoed complaints about the permissive aspects of progressive education and open education, was whether a democratic education system best served its students by letting them choose what they wanted to study, if they wanted to study; or whether it served them best by seeing that each and every one of them received a liberal education--including literature and language, science and mathematics, history and the arts. The debate reiterated the old arguments: one side claimed that a democratic school system had to proceed through the willing consent of the governed; the other insisted that a democratic school system had to assure everyone a sound education or suffer the creation of differential elites and of intolerable popular ignorance. (p. 326)This is well said, but what is the answer? Have we been served well by all of the methodological churning fostered by colleges of education striving for innovation? Do such colleges represent a force for enlightenment or a force for (unintended but catastrophic) disruption and failure? When the author looks at actual studies of issues (viz. do students actually learn more effectively under condition X?) she tends to conclude that there are arguments on both sides. The reader's dilemma: have we made the schools guinea pigs for the theory de jour, in some cases handicapping a generation or is everything just fine or is it simply too complex to know? (We are in the same place today. There are advocates, for example, for `different learning styles'. They urge us to personalize learning, student by student. What does this mean? Will some be permitted to keep journals rather than write formal essays? Will some be permitted to take oral exams rather than written exams? Will some be asked to learn certain material but be permitted to bypass other material? This is an issue which could lead to great academic success or serious academic failure. I have seen studies that suggest there really is no such thing as a different learning style. Can I count on those studies?)One of the most frightening documents a contemporary can contemplate is a list of the learning expectations of a one-room schoolhouse in the days prior to the world of modern innovations. The colleges of education look back to such institutions as `drill-and-grill' Gradgrind-loving chambers of torture. Perhaps there is something to that point of view. It is, however, an undeniable fact that the `revised' system has resulted in massive credential creep. A solid high school education of the 1930's or 40's could lead to a job that now requires a baccalaureate as well as a graduate degree. I was in my local bank two days ago and the manager told me that he now hires tellers with MBA degrees.Diane Ravitch is well aware of the reduction in expectations, the eroding of core curricula, grade inflation and the poor performance of students on standardized examinations which were common at the time of her writing. Now, thirty plus years later, commentators are generally agreed that the situation has not improved. Indeed, it has become much more desperate. My bottom line: in studying the history of preceding periods we should attempt to examine individual events and issues with an eye on public policy. We must sift and winnow (as the University of Wisconsin motto encourages) and determine what is effective and what is deleterious. There is too much at stake in our understanding of a crucial sector of the national culture, a sector which is at the center of attempts to enhance and perpetuate that national life in general and to help those most at risk within it. Is everything just fine or have we created a situation which has resulted in differential elites and intolerable popular ignorance?

As I've written before, it's always good to get Parker off of autopilot, out of Boston and put him on a slight stretch. Under those conditions you see his real skills as a writer. In a different time and a different setting he is forced to develop a sense of place, a sense of language and a sense of character and he's always up to the task. There's no feeling of exaggeration, with heavyhanded indications that he's now in his 'western mode'. The people, places, language, and attentiveness to nuance are all spot on. As in all good genre writing there is a faithfulness to expectation. The plot is traditional--the nasty, tyrannical, lawless rancher vs. the hapless townfolk, who bring in the hired guns--and there are nice set pieces (a tracking scene across great distances, ruminations on gender relationships in the old west, some local color and historical authenticity with a Kiowa brave counting coup). My only reservation concerns the ending, which comes a little too quickly, a little too neatly, and is a tad short on blood, gore, and justice/vengeance. Nevertheless, this is a strong western, at least the equal of its predecessor and top summer reading.

This is a cute, comedic crime series with the crime coming in a distant third after the cuteness and the comedy. The cuteness comes from the dialogue between the principals: a straightlaced, serious but Barbie-appearing detective inspector and her male partner: a rule-dodging, skirt-chasing charmer.The supporting characters include a comic crime scene examiner and the male lead's black, ex-partner who now runs a restaurant that serves pancakes, smoothies, wine and mixed drinks. The ex-partner baits the female lead with racial sensitivity before announcing that he was only messing with her.The three first-season episodes are replete with political incorrectness played for laughs, most of which works very well. The show is light in tone; the interactions between the principals are sweet, funny, and sometimes queasy-making.The series grows on you. It's fun to see Toby Stephens (a dark and dire heavy in Die Another Day) playing it for laughs and it's good to see Lucy Punch again, after her small but memorable role in Doc Martin. This is essentially fluff, but fluff done very well, with solid writing and nice interplay between the crime plots and the characters' personal lives, the latter of which carry the show. In three episodes now, we have still not seen the inside of a police station.This is hip comedy a cut below the much more ambitious New Tricks, but it offers the perfect hour break at the end of the day when everyone wants a good smile.

The reason this book appears to be so retro is that most of the current crime writers are trying to follow the editorial rules and transcend the genre. The notion is that you have to reach a broader audience: noir with suspense, noir with horror, noir with psychological thrills, noir with . . . whatever. How about noir straight up and in a dirty glass? Here it is. The REAL THING doesn't have to feel like a guilty pleasure. It's the REAL THING. So join Eddie and Vonda and J.C. and company on that dark road. You know right where it's going but you still can't stop reading.Let's hope this starts a trend. What we need is a stable of solid writers of paperback originals. The world hasn't felt right since Donald Hamilton stopped writing. Thanks, Andrew, for reminding us how sweet it can be.

It is hard to conceive of a bad Parker novel. By now his skills are so honed, his characters so familiar, his dialogue so effortless, his sense of place so assured and his plots so polished that he is the safest buy in crime fiction.This is good, average Parker, with very deft depiction of the accounting scams motivating the crime. As others have noted, the Enron parallels are explicit, there is too much Susan and too little action. Still, we buy the books and enjoy them.We all continue to wonder, however, what Parker could do if he really put his mind to it, sent Susan and Pearl, incommunicado, to the farthest reaches of the globe, and focused on Hawk and Vinnie in a good old fashioned bloodfest. That might be his gift to his faithful readers for enduring the kissy face, dainty eating, cutesy-poo talk and dog slobber all these years.

I recommended this book to a student yesterday and I was very surprised to see that it had not yet been reviewed on Amazon.com. The book is an absolute classic--the beginning point for any serious study of category fiction. As the title implies, the book covers mysteries, westerns, romances, social melodramas--the full spectrum of genre writing. It does so in ways that are both historical and theoretical and it does so for a wide audience. Academics have used this book for a generation and general readers will find it fascinating, accessible, thoughtful and enjoyable. What are the roots of genre fiction? Why do we read it? Who are its most successful practitioners? How do we differentiate among various forms, including cozies and American noir? This is the place to start. It is both 'introductory' and magisterial. Very highly recommended.

Don't miss this one. EL is doing his full-tilt boogie and he's doing it in Detroit. Great, Runyonesque thickie characters, unlikely but delicious romantic subplots and a plot that is tighter than a drumskin in July. The Master is back and he's in his comic mode. GET SHORTY remains his masterpiece but this comes very close. Buy. Read. Enjoy.

As some reviewers have noted, this Sherlock Holmes is more faithful to Conan Doyle's original. Fair enough, but it is shot in a style that is more appropriate for video game players than traditional viewers and readers. The genre is action/adventure cum crime and detective fiction and the dialogue (as in the Benedict Cumberbatch Holmes) is delivered with breathless rapidity. Many will cry out for subtitles, but by the time you would have been able to read them the camera would have moved on to the next scene (or scenes). Ritchie's film is visually stunning at many points. I don't mind the CGI; the image of the city with Tower Bridge under construction is fantastic. The atmospherics are superb. However, the soundtrack may be one of the most annoying and grating ever created.The story is vague, but Holmes explains it all at the end. There is also a lot going on: an evil lord set out to beat the hangman and take over the world; plants, nostrums, diabolical devices, a love interest for Watson, a love interest/competing criminal for Holmes and, in the background, off camera, the looming Moriarty (with a little professorial chalk on his lapels--Ritchie doesn't lack a sense of humor).My advice to viewers: know what you're getting into; don't be disappointed. The movie has some considerable strengths, but this is a film for the short-attention-span generation.

This is a don't miss, one of the best autobiographies of the last decade. Joyce Maynard's subject, here and elsewhere, is Joyce Maynard. It is a subject she knows better than any other and, like the high Romantics, her study of the self (at its best) ripples out to encompass and illuminate a larger world. Here she is definitely at her best.The experiences with Salinger add subsidiary interest and a touch of scandal, though her experiences within her family are also instructive. The hissy fits thrown by some reviewers demonstrate their preference for ignorance and secretiveness when one of their icons is in the dock. In an age of unending self-indulgence and self-reflection, not to mention the near total politicization of letters, one can hardly exaggerate the degree of hollowness in the claims that one should consider the art alone and leave the private activities of the artist behind closed doors.As one of Amazon's astute reviewers noted, if you don't want your activities to end up in print, don't be so foolish as to seduce and abandon a journalist.The most delicious dimension of the book is its subtext. What Joyce Maynard is, of course, doing, is rewriting CATCHER and recording the details of the discovery of the biggest phony of them all, the landsman as virtual child molester.The blame-the-female-victim response of reviewers one might expect more from serves as a kind of coda, one that Joyce Maynard was surely shrewd enough to anticipate. They went for the bait like hungry trout, demonstrating their own phoniness and complicity in a literary culture obsessed with victimology but unable to stomach its realities when it hits just a little too close to home. Joyce didn't even have to turn on the lights which revealed their convenient forgetting of their own ideologies; they grabbed at the switch all by themselves.One doesn't often see the joining of high Romantic practice with the techniques of the modern journalist. Here one sees them in ways so expert and so exquisite that all one can do is urge others to share the view. Get out your lamb patties and your homeopathic nostrums and watch one very cool customer play Spot the Phony.

Get the Edgar award ready and why not the Pulitzer or National Book Award? James Lee Burke has long shown that three planets CAN come into alinement: top crime fiction, great mainstream fiction, and strong commercial success. They call him the Faulkner of crime fiction, but he's that and more. No one can plot AND create characters AND produce atmospherics AND ponder significant themes and ideas the way he can. Most of all, he's amazingly consistent, so that comparisons between the novels or attempts to rank the novels are always much more a function of taste than objective fact. PEGASUS DESCENDING is fabulous. Clete is in full tilt mode, Dave is just as we like him, moving between the ultra-contemplative and the ultra-violent, the latter following logically from the former. This is the book of the summer and probably, the year.

First off, pay no attention to the `editorial reviews' section. The women of London are not being terrorized by the Whistler. The Whistler, like Dalgleish, is in Norfolk. Dalgleish has inherited the windmill/cottage of his recently-deceased aunt and he is vacationing there when suspicions and fears concerning the Whistler's murders dominate the local scene. In some ways, this is awkward for the plot, for Dalgleish investigates the murders, informally, but he is not in charge of the investigation; a former colleague/subordinate is.This part of Norfolk (despite the beautiful Norman churches which dot the countryside) is a nasty bit of business. Just for starters, Dalgleish must deal with: a brother and sister team who may have killed their father, an alcoholic widower with a brood of kids, one of whom goes to a local ruin at night to pray, some local retro-hippies protesting the nearby nuclear power plant, some very real terrorists who have hacked into the power plant's computer system and might bring the China syndrome to Norfolk; a smarmy personal assistant to the plant director who appears to have a checkered past, a plant worker who suicides by leaping to his death on the cap covering the core at the plant, and, lest we forget--the Whistler himself (herself?), who goes about strangling women and putting body hair in their mouths.Bottom line: a few too many characters and a bit too much mystification in the plot. The redeeming elements: performances by Susannah York and the always excellent Gemma Jones. Marsden mumbles as Dalgleish; although he is the iconic player of this part, because of longevity, Martin Shaw is far more effective in the role. Those who have not seen him as Dalgleish should prepare themselves for a rare treat.The major problem with the production is the sound. There are no subtitles; there is a great deal of mumbling and the sound is simply done incompetently. When characters continue talking but turn their heads away from the camera or go to the door, etc. we are suddenly unable to hear them properly. In a 5-hour+, very talky story this is a significant problem. At points there are whole sentences and paragraphs which are inaudible. Assuming a sound level of 1-10 on your TV remote, where you usually listen to programming at "4", you need to crank up your set to "8" or "9" just to hear the characters. Then, however, you are confronted with the intrusive background music or, in some cases, background noise. Here we have a major production with serious actors and a serious script, but the finished film sounds like something done by a beginning film student in his garage.If you are able to (more or less) hear it, the story will hold your attention. This is for one of those long nights or weekends when you lack a good book to read and can count on the fact that if it's P. D. James it won't be all that bad.

This is an important book on an important subject. Hogan's purpose here is to introduce the humanities reader to the ways and insights of cognitive science and to summarize some of the attempts to apply those ways and insights to literature and the arts. This is an activity that is long overdue. The growth in knowledge of the human brain and human cognition has been as dramatic as the distance from that knowledge exhibited by studies within the humanities, which have often been more interested in `theorizing' science in postmodern ways than in joining with scientists to understand the humanities in more scientific ways.While this effort is of enormous importance, it is at a very preliminary stage. For one thing, the actual functioning of the brain is so sophisticated and complex that many descriptions of cognitive processes are more metaphoric than conventionally `scientific'. That does not mean that they are not systematic or thoughtful. Rather, they depict the processes of cognition in terms that are far more simple than what is clearly going on. It is no surprise that Kant is key to their procedures, for the Kantian model of a human observer trying to bridge an unbridgeable gulf, constrained by decidedly `human' equipment but nevertheless attaining useful knowledge, is much in evidence here.Given the `metaphoric' nature of this knowledge, it should come as no surprise that its conclusions often square with those of thinkers whose methods and materials predate those of cognitive science. For example, Hogan's interesting discussion about creativity involving both novelty and aptness squares precisely with Samuel Johnson's demands for novelty and what we would term something like `faithfulness to the realities of human psychology'. Hogan's argument to the effect that creativity at the highest levels carries common elements and is applicable across fields (the creativity required in writing an epic being comparable to the creativity required in teasing out the realities of the double helix) replicates Johnson's judgment that Newton could have written a fine epic poem, had he so desired.Hogan is particularly strong in his critique of evolutionary psychology and the contradictory lessons that it often draws. His arguments are as trenchant as they are clear and he is able to offer very suggestive examples to support them. In short, this is an excellent introduction to what will become an immensely important subject, but one that carries no illusions with regard to the position in which we now find ourselves.

This is a well-written novel about crime, but not a novel that meets the expectations of those seeking 'crime fiction.' This is art fiction, short on incident, long on characterization. While it held my attention it was not in any way suspenseful. Nor was it comic. Something bad has happened to a good man. We eventually learn the mundane but still shattering details. In the meantime he is working on another case which ultimately elucidates his own situation. That's about it, along with some reflections on Brooklyn which are nicely done. This is not, however, a heavily textured reflection on place of the sort associated with a master like James Lee Burke. While the Brooklyn portrayed is darker than Jonathan Lethem's it is not so fully realized as to be a central presence in its own right. My guess is that readers of art fiction are generally not readers of crime fiction and the former may have taken this novel to be the sort of thing read by the latter. It isn't, but it's well done.

Publishers Weekly said it all: "Neither a proper mystery nor particularly fine literature, this haunting novella, for all its strengths, lies uneasily between the two and will fully please few fans of each. " Readers of art novels may find a respite here, but devotees of mystery, suspense, and crime are unlikely to do so. The characters are not very interesting and there is inadequate space to develop them. I can't decide whether the book is missing a third act or a first and third act, but it's missing something with regard to plot. The texture is OK, but a far cry from the atmospherics of, e.g., a James Lee Burke. The saddest thing is that the question being posed--what is the parrot talking about?--is given more prominence than the characters, the plot, the mystery or criminality at the heart and (WARNING--SPOILER ALERT) the answer to the question is telegraphed in the jacket design. It was the old man himself who said that when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, is the truth. The book is not like, e.g., PRESUMED INNOCENT--in which the reader anticipates the ending from the beginning, hoping against hope that he or she is wrong, and then discovers (ouch!) that he or she is unfortunately right. Instead, the book poses the question--could the parrot be talking about a? b? c? d? You look at the cover, guess "e" and discover at the end that you are right. The deflated response is particularly unfortunate, given the historical enormity at the center of the answer.

This interesting book argues a number of points. First, one of the reasons that we have survived and prospered as a species is related to our ability to read others' minds, i.e., to infer their beliefs, desires, and intentions from their words, behaviors, demeanors, visual cues, and so forth. (Societies that were story-intensive, Paul Hernadi suggests, may have been particularly successful in developing these advantages.) The ability to do such things is highlighted by the difficulty with such behaviors exhibited by the autistic and the schizophrenic. In addition to reading minds, we qualify and contextualize representations made by others by being attentive to the fact that the representations are not necessarily straightforward, unvarnished and reliable. They are, rather, metarepresentations and it is important that we learn to recognize them and absorb them in specific ways.The novel is particularly suited to mirror these processes and, hence, both hone our own skills and recapitulate the importance of those skills in our evolutionary development. Different genres do this in different ways and at different levels of intensity. The novel has triumphed as a form for other reasons; this is only a single nexus of reasons for its success, but it is an interesting one for the literary student to observe, since it highlights the importance of cognitive science for humanities research.In general, the humanities have (in their recent incarnations) been wary of science, fearing its dominance and seeking to undermine its truth claims. This is ultimately self-defeating, to the degree that the insights of science are relevant to humanistic study and have existed, in effect, as a grand, missed opportunity. Scholars such as Professor Zunshine are seeking to alter that situation and their efforts should be applauded and encouraged.The book is relatively `easy going' for literary scholars, for its insights are embedded in both the more recent `theoretical' traditions and the more historical/traditional work of worthies such as John Cawelti and Wayne Booth. I leave to the reader to decide whether the work of such figures has stood the test of time more effectively than that of more recent commentators. It is certainly true that they speak with a degree of clarity and point that stands in contrast to the poststructuralist/postmodernist language of theory. Even within the context of Professor Zunshine's laudable intentions and palpable successes, one sometimes has the feeling that `theory' complicates the obvious by substituting a vocabulary less transparent than that of earlier practitioners. The notion, presumably, is that the material is so complex that it requires language commensurate with that complexity, but one can argue as well that the complexity requires simpler, clearer terms and that it is one of the chief responsibilities of the specialist to clarify rather than further complicate. That point turns on the intended audience, for many `theorists' have seen their role as communicating with the similarly sophisticated like-minded. General or more traditional readers should welcome Professor Zunshine's book, for she is consciously attempting to clarify and she is consciously attempting to write for a wider audience--not an unsophisticated audience, but an audience with broad interests in the novel rather than narrow interests in small, heavily-theorized aspects of the novel.Ultimately, Why We Read Fiction does not answer that implied question, but it provides one of the reasons why we read fiction and it does so in interesting, informed and engaging ways. Professor Zunshine is quite aware of the larger dimensions of the question and makes no claims with regard to its multifaceted answers. Her purpose here is to bring to bear some of the insights of cognitive science and she does that expertly. Ultimately, this is more `dry' neuroscience than `wet'. We now have the capacity, for example, to observe the activities of the human brain as it undergoes aesthetic experience. We could use an fMRI to watch the brain as its possessor reads a text or hears a text declaimed. We could watch the effects on the brain of a novel versus a sonnet, a science fiction novel versus a hardboiled detective novel, a novel versus a short story, a short story versus a tale, and so on. We are just beginning to make the (often highly speculative and even inchoate) insights of science available to literary study and Professor Zunshine acknowledges that reality. However, one must begin somewhere and she should be applauded for doing so. It should also be acknowledged that, within the parameters of her study, she has been quite successful.

This might have been called 'the Return of Cracker', since Fitz has been in Australia for a decade and returns to find a new Manchester. This one is fueled by drug money. The atmospherics are created by a series of quick-cut montages with loud news reports in the background, all of them focusing on war, terrorism and the politicians held responsible for them. In the subsidiary material on the DVD, Robbie Coltrane points out that the writer (Jimmy McGovern) is motivated to write by his personal experience and personal anger. In this case, he's angry about Iraq (and still angry about the work of the IRA in Ulster and beyond). Presumably, he's also angry about what's happened to Manchester and the cause of all of these problems and issues is, in his judgment, the US. This will seem strange to American audiences, for my guess is that the strongest supporters of the war in Iraq do not overlap significantly with the American supporters of the IRA, i.e., those who have supported the IRA with American dollars. They're both American, of course, but the point is that blind blame of the 'USA' lacks nuance, since many Americans do not support the effort in Iraq and many find the actions of the IRA horrific (along with the support of it by American citizens).This is important to the film since the murderer (superbly played by Anthony Flanagan) has been a soldier in Ulster and is haunted by the memories of his experience there. The problem is that he comes across as a decent, even likeable man whose actions are explainable, if not justified, by his experience. In many ways he carries the film, since he is on screen almost constantly. It is an old rule of narrative that we come to like prominent villains because we have come to know them well. That is certainly the case here, particularly when his victims are unpleasant types who deserve some punishment (if not in the form that they receive). The bottom line is that Fitz is brilliant but unpleasant and irresponsible (as always) and his antagonist in this story has many redeeming features, while the cause of his condition and the blame (totally) laid at the feet of the US seems to lack nuance. The wonderful psychological complexities of both the protagonist and antagonist are undercut by the political screed which constitutes the historical backdrop for the action and atmospherics of the setting. It's worth watching, but--to this viewer--off the mark in its effects on the audience.

The Prime Suspects have all been superb, but the last may well be the best, principally because of Helen Mirren's acting and the quality of the script. As much a drama as a crime drama, "The Final Act" focuses on the private life of the protagonist. Jane's father is on his death bed and she is in her cups. Moreover, there is the overarching fear that she might take a bullet to the gut before her DCI work is concluded. The tone is somber, the supporting cast very able, the lighting and tone pitch perfect.The production values are excellent and the direction exquisite. This is television at its finest as well as its grittiest and most moving. An absolute don't miss.

So what else is there to say? The great Emil Jannings, starring with Evelyn Brent and being directed by von Sternberg. The concept is nothing if not unique--the supreme commander of the Russian army meets the Bolshies and is reduced to being a Hollywood actor, working for one of the Bolshies he had arrested who has, by now, become a Hollywood diva/director. The execution is magnificent. The performances are stellar, the lighting utter magic. In silent film the images tell the story and what a story they tell here. Perfectly.

All of Caroline Quentin's work is worth a look and Life Begins is no exception. The viewer should know, however, that this is not-very-comic drama. There is occasional humor that is more comic relief than truly 'comic'. Maggie Mee's husband abruptly announces that he is unhappy. He moves out and soon there is another woman in his life. Maggie gets a job in a travel agency and, eventually, there is a new man in her life. Along the way we have a lost job, the threat of another lost job, an abortion, a drug overdose, a case of Alzheimer's, sexual temptations, a Blair Witch scene in the woods and sustained tension. By the last episode Maggie's ex-husband (who is living in her lover's house) describes the situation as akin to a French farce. There is little joy and little humor in the initial episodes, though things lighten up a little bit as we move toward the third season conclusion. Caroline Quentin makes it all worthwhile, though the largely unrelieved pain of the initial episodes make this closer to docudrama on the difficulties of modern life than actual comedy. The fact that CQ/Maggie's life is in constant turmoil makes the plotting frenetic to an annoying degree. This seems to be part of CQ's screen persona; her struggles with her kids and the general disorder of her life recalls her performances in Blue Murder, a series that is more successful than Life Begins because it remains faithful to its genre and does not annoy the viewer in the way that Life Begins sometimes does.Recommended for those who like to see characters whose lives are more addled than their own and who appreciate good acting in the face of uneven scripts.

This is the one to buy. It works like a bandit and should meet any walker's needs. It measures steps, aerobic steps, mileage and calories burned. It also has a clock. It clips to your belt or can be carried in your pocket. It is easy to set and recycles each night, so you don't have to reset it for your morning walk. The price is reasonable and the quality high. I'm glad that I bought this one.

I'm not quite sure what this is--fish or fowl? At moments it seems like a chick flick; at other moments it seems like an English mystery; at others there are even tones of horror. There is a long tradition of Brits-in-Italy stories in which the stuffy/repressed Brit comes to life in the presence of Italian passion/chaos. There is a touch of that here, but it is colored by the protagonist's suspicion of her husband's adultery and her suspicions about the strange figures she encounters, one of whom summarily dies, with his brains leaking onto the floor of an emptied swimming pool. One of the protagonist's daughters is asked to clear a drain in a stopped up, claustrophobic well. We expect to find something horrible there, but there's nothing. Along with murder there's a preposterous scam to force the British renters to pay high fees to the water commission when their water is unexpectedly shut off. Finally, there's the protagonist's father--played by Gielgud--a sex-obsessed, duplicitous charmer who, e.g., talks the family into a dentist's apartment above the square in which the Palio is held. There's a lot of Italy here, and some mystery and some good performances but it doesn't congeal, even though the writer is John Mortimer (of Rumpole fame). I have clear expectations with regard to genre and here they were not met. I'm prepared to be surprised and tricked, but this was more of a muddle than a daring experiment. Note that the protagonist, the late Susan Fleetwood, is Mick's younger sister--she played Lady Russell in the Amanda Root Persuasion, a fine actress. Gielgud won an emmy for his performance.

For my money, this is the best of the P.D. James telefilms. Martin Shaw is far superior to Roy Marsden as Adam Dalgleish and here he is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast from Robert Hardy and Jesse Spencer (of "House" fame) to the stunning Alan Howard. Dalgleish has returned to St. Anselm's, a seaside college at which he had spent peaceful time as a youth. A sleazy archdeacon, who was accused of murdering his wife and who may have railroaded one of the St. Anselm priests on a child molestation charge, is about to close the college and relocate its extremely valuable art. Needless to say, the archdeacon doesn't make it to the last reel. He's bludgeoned to death in the church and his body is only one of those that finally constitute the pile. Dalgleish investigates in his own sweet way and even finds time for a little personal romance. The production values are high and the direction expert. (Warning: a little explicit sex and some nudity.)The dvd includes a nice special feature in which P.D. James talks about her work and about the mystery and crime genres. She gives particular attention to setting and discusses enclosed worlds and the ways in which they have traditionally functioned in stories of this sort.Excellent all around; don't miss it.

This is a fine book, but its title could be very misleading. The operative word is `economics'. It is not a how-to book for parents or prospective students and it is not a critical/analytical study of contemporary higher education. It is an economic analysis of specific issues that are important in higher education. For example, are there positive (or negative) results from one's having a college roommate or circle of friends who have higher or lower SAT scores than one's own? Do students make `efficient' choices when they pick a college based on the different aid packages and different levels of academic quality which the competing institutions offer?More often than not, the answers are hedged, not because the authors of the individual chapters are afraid to speak the truth, but rather because the conclusions that can be inferred from the data adduced are sometimes clear, sometimes cloudy. Most of the answers to most of the questions are not counter-intuitive and that is always comforting, but sometimes the evidence does not lead to tidy conclusions.In short, this is quantitative social science, not educational or social punditry. The conclusions of a 40-50 pp. article are usually summarized in a handful of sentences. The bulk of the article consists of the posing of the question, a review of the existing literature, a discussion of the data set(s) and the methods of analysis, a series of charts, graphs and equations, a (sometimes modest) set of conclusions and, then, a comment from an independent economist, often with suggestions for future lines of research.The contributors include several of the top economists specializing in higher education research and the book will be of great interest to their colleagues. Laymen and laywomen may find some interesting items. For example, while it is not counter-intuitive it is interesting to see analytic, quantitative minds wrestling with the realities of government policy, particularly as it affects education and the tax code. We have often developed programs which are underutilized because they are largely unintelligible to those who most need them. In general, however, this is a book for economists interested in basic research, not parents, prospective students and general readers.

Nothing Lost contains all the right elements: a good plot, good characters, weighty themes, and fine sentence-by-sentence writing. Unfortunately, these elements do not coalesce into an excellent novel. The book is, finally, a hash. Plot lines are disjunct; speaking voices are unidentifiable; transitions are often nonexistent. It feels as if someone took a great novel, threw the pages into the air and then printed the clumps that came down together in no particular order. Dunne did not see the book through to final page proofs, but a strong editorial hand could have made this book competitive with True Confessions, Dunne's masterpiece in fiction.Having said that, I must also say that I finished it and that I enjoyed it and that I admire its constituent elements. It is sad that the book's narrative potential was not reached.

Dalrymple has now given us several books that explore the behavior of the underclass and the manner in which academic theory has stimulated public policy which reinforces rather than reduces that behavior. The stories that provide living examples of that behavior are compelling and engaging. The subtexts are equally engaging. What is the nature of the bureaucracy which feeds on dysfunctionality but does not ameliorate it? What is the nature of the political 'leadership' which ensures its own success and survival by perpetuating the dysfunctionality?I would love to see Dalrymple do a book in which he explores at length the clash between his Hobbesian take on human nature and the Rousseau/Marx-inspired view that is its contrary. Why do utopian views persist in a world that has known the gulags and the holocaust? Why do emotion-laden theories and policies persist in the face of recalcitrant realities? To what degree are the 'debates' authentic and to what degree are they shams? Does discredited theory persist in order to keep the 'underclass industry' in place? How do we walk the line between permissive decadence on the one hand and authoritarian constraint on the other? How do "reasonable people" (i.e. those who don't want a world of constant obscenity and irresponsibility on the one hand, nor a world in which we will be whipped for chewing gum on the other) play a greater role in this effort? How do we give voice to those (are they a silent majority?) who neither desire a return to a bigoted and puritanical past nor a continuation of the crudity, violence, and ignorance of the present?

Vachss's new Burke novel is long on texture and shorter on plot. The latter is complex and, at some points, faint, but the novel is still a great read, principally because of the characters, setting, and patented Burkean one-liners, a hallmark of the genre.As some readers have commented, Burke's self-awareness appears to be growing. The most striking change is a moderated view of Wesley, who is still the mythic sociopath, but much more Burke's sociopath than in the past. We all still miss Pansy, but Burke has some Pansy surrogates and even a more or less long-term girlfriend (I think). He's mellowing . . . and he's entitled.

The ancients believed that writers should begin modestly and then work their way through the genres until they attained the skill to attempt the epic form. Lee Child started at the top and he's not coming down from the mountain.His books are marked by a very high and very even level of quality; each can be recommended with equal enthusiasm. He is also one of the hardest working writers in the game, chasing down elusive facts and playing out exotic threads of detail. Check out his riff on the U.S. constitution in WITHOUT FAIL (and the Holmesian homage as Jack explains its importance).And yes, he is an Englishman (from Cumbria), though his subjects, ethos, and protagonist are all American. Like Tim Willocks he is an Atlantic crime novelist, equally at home on either side of the water.For those who may be concerned: relax, they love him in the U.K. WITHOUT FAIL is disappearing from the shelves of British bookstores and Child is commanding major media attention in his homeland. He is big, big, big.

Morse is at his best under three conditions: when he has a chance to utilize his education; when he becomes emotionally involved with women whose actions affect the case and when his interactions with Lewis reveal the synergy between them and the respect and affection which undergird it. In this case, Morse and Lewis are in Vicenza, Italy, investigating the death of a woman who has been participating in a self-help program run by an Englishman previously arrested by Morse. The con artist/guru is played by the superb Michael Kitchen, who attempts to outsmart and badger Morse (never a good idea). The location shots are excellent, particularly the scenes in a roman amphitheatre converted for use as an opera house. As the soprano sings and the tears moisten Morse's eyes and cheeks, we're in Morse heaven. The plot is complex, the dialogue poignant, the direction expert. Check it out.

It's not that Morse and Lewis aren't up to the task. The problem is that, as Morse himself puts it, it's hard to care about who's guilty and who's innocent in a world of white-collar criminals who have been imprisoned for their misdeeds and are now jockeying for position over their hidden swag. All, of course, is not quite as it seems and the plot thickens nicely as we approach the story's conclusion. The story involves the incomparable Jim Broadbent as well as the deliciously hateful Sean Bean. Look for other exceptional British character actors along the way. The story is claustrophobic because of its prison setting, but this is a prison in which the inmates are allowed to leave from time to time, a prison in which there are 'rooms' rather than 'cells', a prison presided over by a would-be reformer, with an eye for Morse. Check it out. If it's slow going, take comfort in the fact that the ending will repay your attention.

I have been with Peter Blauner from the beginning and this is his best novel. The solution of the crimes takes second place to his depiction of character, and despite the inevitability of the solution the suspense is expertly sustained. Blauner conceives of his task in somewhat different terms than some of his readers might expect. He sees himself as a writer of social novels with elements of mystery and suspense. I believe that he is right. In an interesting reversal, however, his fiction transcends the mainstream rather than transcending genre. This is an impressive, must-read.

On cover blurbs and elsewhere (interviews with Laurie's biographer, e.g.) this book has been described as a send-up. It is not. Get Smart was a send-up. Our Man Flint and In Like Flint were send-ups. This is a conventional crime/espionage novel with a unique voice. The voice suggests a number of self-conscious, wry, clever narrators, but I suspect that this is, to a considerable degree, Laurie's natural voice. The result is a wry, clever, sometimes very funny narration, with a serious subject, interesting characters and brisk plot. The book works.Tom Lang, the protagonist, is world weary but effective, a man whose personal integrity gets him into trouble, a relatively common man in some uncommon (but ultimately stereotypical) company. He is very much the Chandler hero on the international scene, finding a web of corruption and using his skills to disentangle it. Beyond the joking he is not very much like James Bond. As much as I hate to say it, he is what you would get if you gave Greg House two good legs, some martial arts training, and slightly softer edges with regard to women. Good book. I look forward to Laurie's next.

This is a lovely book with something for every reader--romance, mystery, suspense, period detail, and some grounding in historical fact. Above all, however, it is a story about a man and his public triumph over personal demons--loneliness, quirkiness, abuse and abandonment (a tad, at least), and the need to follow his own lights rather than his father's expectations. It is a sweet and touching book, a tale of an awkward and innocent genius. There are a lot of allegorical subtext things going on about the nature and magic of writing too, but save that for the academicians. This is a pleasant, leisurely read with a few passages of breathless suspense and a kicker ending, also some wholesome sex and not too grisly violence--the perfect book for long fall afternoons.

Welcome to the suburbs, crime-fiction style. This is Peter Blauner's best since SLOW MOTION RIOT. Thoreau says that most men lead lives of quiet desperation. Here's exhibit A. Except that the women are just as desperate. And the police may or may not be of much help. The Irish/Jewish interplay is honest and effective, the plotting superb, the middle-class tragic ending satisfying. Considering the fact that most of the violence is psychological and the frightening atmospherics result largely from mundane suburban situations, this is impressive work indeed. Blauner delivers all of the suspenseful un-put-downableness of a Lee Child, but with very different materials and in a quite different ethos. Bravo.

Michael Connelly's standalones are always exceptional. CHASING THE DIME is in the same class as THE POET, a must read. The subject is right out of today's headlines, headlines in SCIENCE or NATURE, that is. Connelly's protagonist is in the midst of the nanotechnology revolution and, as usual, the money on the table leads to blood on the floor. And on the bed. And in a storage locker.This is very close to perfect, with a few key exceptions. The plot turns on two expectations: that an inventor/scientist named Henry can be a crime fiction hero and that he will have a sense of curiosity so hypertrophied that it will lead him to take unconscionable risks at just those points in his life when he has everything--both romantic and financial--to lose. Both of these expectations are a stretch.The plotting, however, is superb, the subject fascinating, the pacing state-of-the-art. Suspend your disbelief and come along for the ride.

This is an interesting book, one that runs counter to, e.g., Ronald Ehrenberg's book (Tuition Rising) on the growth in university costs. Where Ehrenberg is largely accepting of `the way things are' in higher education and more prone to reforms at the margins, Vedder portrays himself as an `outsider' and a skeptic, questioning fundamental assumptions about the funding of higher education and offering striking, even radical alternatives.His position is that of a gadfly, challenging received wisdom and commonly-accepted methods of proceeding. He is, however, a university professor (at Ohio University), not a real, raging outsider, and he is, like Ehrenberg, an economist. As an economist, he is fond of charts, graphs, data and evidence and his book is particularly useful for the information that it offers. For example, even when he juxtaposes for-profit education with not-for-profit education in ways that might make those who participate in the latter uncomfortable, he offers useful and informative material on, e.g., the University of Phoenix.His principal concern is economic. Much of U.S. higher education is, in effect, being funded by third parties (the government, lending agencies, endowments . . . ) and individuals are far less likely to be sensitive to price when someone else is paying (or helping to pay) the bill. This is exacerbated by the fact that universities spend all their available money (more or less) and are not constrained by the need to yield profits. In economic terms, they lack fiscal discipline, a situation further exacerbated by their governance mechanisms.Hence he poses big questions. Should we abolish tenure? Should we privatize all public education? Should we suspend all government support for higher education? Should we have single indirect-cost rates for all research universities, rates that would be lower than the current average? Should we move to a system of vouchers in which the government money should all go directly to students? Should the vouchers be portable across state lines (and include private institutions)?His conclusions tend to be more moderate, since they are tempered by political and cultural realities. The information which he adduces, however, when he pursues his questions, is very useful and informative.I would recommend that readers of Ehrenberg also read Vedder (and vice-versa). The two complement one another in interesting ways and both offer interesting material for consideration.

The Gates of Eden was shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award and deserved that honor. (Susan Sontag's On Photography won.) A study of the sixties, its materials are largely cultural, though there is political, historical and personal matter as well.A child of the 50's writing in the 70's, Dickstein is able to put the period in perspective. The Harvard trade paperback provides a new introduction, with an additional 20 years of insight. All of the chapters are strong, but the material on beat poetry and experimental fiction is particularly interesting. He is (forgivably) less acute when he discusses popular music. Dickstein is an old-fashioned, judicial critic. He is crisp and clear in his evaluations and he does not hesitate to state his judgments and preferences. He attacks (Tom Wolfe, e.g.) when he feels it is necessary and he separates wheat from chaff (with Barthelme, e.g.).Most important, his historical assessment is balanced. He sees the strengths of the sixties but he also sees the period's radical shortcomings. Since the sixties are the great dividing force of our time it is appropriate to position him. Moderate with leftist inclinations, he is conservative in his intellectual posture. One of the characteristic moves of the sixties was to associate traditional literary study of classic texts (perceived, at Columbia, as a countercultural activity) with conservatism. Dickstein recounts the horror felt by his colleagues when they saw their activity characterized in this manner. His touchstone character in this regard is Lionel Trilling; Dickstein charts the roots of Trilling's views and the changes those views underwent as they received criticism from radical students.The book illustrates that it is possible to separate scholarship and teaching from politics, even when politics are a strong interest. With all of the screeds concerning a politicized, radical academy, some tend to forget that one might vote on the left but see the merits of great books and traditional modes of scholarship. Dickstein considers himself non-traditional, but he looks very traditional from the perspective of 2011. "Traditional" in the 1950's meant philology. Dickstein would be `nontraditional' in his use of, e.g., popular culture, but he looks very traditional today and his willingness to take stands, draw distinctions and trace explicit historical patterns is refreshing and helpful.This is a fine book on an important subject. Contemporary readers should not be put off by its 1977 date; it remains very relevant today.

This is a 5-star stunner. In some ways it's like no book you've ever read. In other ways it is quintessentially faithful to genre and hence immensely satisfying. Horace said that art should both teach and please. Samuel Johnson said that art should be new but also just, i.e., be faithful to (human) nature. The result is a simultaneous 'why didn't I think of that?' and 'I wouldn't change a word'. If a piece of art is only novel (in Johnson's construct) it is simply weird. If it is only just it is simply trite. The balance is something that Hollywood eternally seeks--something fresh (at last!) but something that works (at last!).Here we have an autistic or limited/autistic narrator who is utterly reliable because he cannot lie. He is presented with a touching mystery that he seeks to solve. In doing so he draws on all of his experiences and resources and, ultimately, not only solves the crime (and more) but attains a measure of personal redemption. He's 15 years old. He lives in Swindon, Wiltshire.For those who don't know Swindon, it's touted as the gateway to the west country, but it's more industrial than bucolic. It's the birthplace of Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues and the site of the 'death roundabout', one of the most complex series of traffic circles in England. More to the point, on The Office, Swindon is one of the locations of the paper company that we see in Slough. Enough said. Thus, we also have a moderately gritty setting, appropriate to crime fiction.Note: the book is not ponderous. It is not preachy. The plot does not plod. This is a brisk read. Hey, it's genre fiction--but not like any other you've read (except, to a small degree, like Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn). It's not sentimental; it's not politically correct; it's none of the things that you might think it is. It's just a terrific crime novel with an engaging protagonist.A must-read.

I'm not sure that this is a novel for diehard fans, since it lacks the clear, lean narrative that usually characterizes this master's works. There are too many characters, too many vague plot lines, too much texture, too much technical detail. There is not enough grit, not enough action, not enough memorable one-liners.In short, it's not your usual Mickey Spillane book. Here, he's doing things that others do much better rather than doing the things that no one can do like him. For a weathered, government operative with old values and old expressions, go for a Donald Hamilton, who can also do boats and action at sea.Maybe it's just me. This is a guy who always deserves the benefit of the doubt. Keep writing, Mickey.

Jim Broadbent is one of our greatest living actors and he is incapable of giving a bad performance. This is a difficult role for him, since the character he plays is radically flawed and not particularly likeable. The story concerns his son's attempts to reconnect with him as he approaches death. It is told in flashbacks and it is touching in moments and beautifully filmed throughout. The problem is that it lacks a clear structure, a plot arc that successfully shapes the action and effects an emotional and intellectual response. With such an arc, each scene advances the action and multiplies its impact. Here the story meanders and the emotional interplay of the characters fails to reach a satisfactory, layered conclusion. As some of the Amazon reviewers have noted, the film will not lack an audience because many would watch Colin Firth reading the phone book. I don't think one should miss any performance by Broadbent, but to see him at the absolute top of his form, see Topsy-Turvy. Firth is an actor with more range than some give him credit for; see him in the very interesting film, The Advocate.

Just for the record, the chief protagonist's name is pronounced [Di:el]. He's a Scot and he regularly makes the point that this is his name's proper pronunciation. Set in a fictional town in Yorkshire, Dalziel is a Detective Superintendent, Pascoe a soon-to-be-promoted Detective Inspector. The latter is married to a spicy, aspiring novelist/teacher with a taste for left-leaning causes as well as her husband, Peter, whose detective work she tolerates and even indulges in herself, on occasion.The center of the stories, however, is Dalziel, `the fat man', `the big man', but mostly the very, very clever man. The center of the central character is his wit, expressed in memorable phrases. He is like a battle-hardened Army sergeant, who has an expression for every occasion. Pascoe is his straight man--with more formal education but far fewer street smarts.The cases are interesting, with a bit more sex and violence than on, e.g. Midsomer Murders, but less grittiness than in, e.g. Trial and Retribution or Waking the Dead. The production values are strong, the plots tight, the local color rich.It is not fair to say that Dalziel is the `whole show', but it is difficult to imagine the show working without him. Warren Clarke plays him beautifully. A character actor with a great range, you see his edgy violence in the role of Dim in A Clockwork Orange and his utter sweetness playing Vic Wilcox in the BBC production of David Lodge's novel, Nice Work. The tartness and sweetness are both on display here and he clearly relishes this role.Highly recommended.

I always look forward to a new book by Steve Thayer and I'm never disappointed. He characteristically mixes time levels in interesting and creative ways and manages to write period pieces from a contemporary perspective without sacrificing period detail. In WOLF PASS he's back in Kickapoo Falls, WI with trips to such local mainstays as Devil's Lake and the Wisconsin Dells. I spent 12 years of my life in those environs and Thayer has nailed them. As usual, there's the perfect mix of plot, setting, and character with appropriate dollops of sex and, in this case, nazis. Who could ask for more?Steve Thayer is also highly skilled at depicting real people and real events in ways that demonstrate the fiction writer's art. In this book, for example, there is a plot line involving an assassination attempt that targets President Kennedy. Hey, you know it's not going to happen, because JFK didn't die in St. Paul, but you're still worried. You're in the hands of a pro and he's making you squirm.Very nice work.

This set includes the pilot episode which resulted in the series that became a British mainstay. That episode, Killer, is a serial killer tale with a by-now conventional ending (though the ending is not telegraphed along the way). Taggart is a rough-around-the-edges Glasgow detective. Crusty and clip in his speech, he takes on a DS assistant who has studied in a public school and then the Univ. of Edinburgh. The sergeant is not afraid to disagree with his superior and eventually the crime is solved. The supporting cast is strong, the plot engaging. The direction is good, but the shifting between film and tape for exterior and interior shots is quaint. The biggest challenge is the Glaswegian accent and there are no subtitles. At some points the American audience is likely to get somewhere between 50%-60% of the dialogue and lose the rest. Crank up the volume and listen hard. The accent is compounded by the (plausible and appropriate) use of Scottish idiom (e.g. 'when he was wee' rather than 'when he was young' or 'when he was little'). Soldier on. It's worth the effort.

This is basically a guide to sometimes `overlooked' colleges. As such, its short write-ups on those colleges could prove useful to potential students. Many of the colleges named are fine institutions. Thus, this is one book among many that High School juniors and their parents might wish to consult. The financial information, however, is hit-and-miss. Tuition and fees, room/board costs and scholarship resources are likely to be important to readers and this book is spotty with regard to those details. Much of the material is anecdotal and while that is always vivid and potentially helpful it runs the risk of being unrepresentative. The book's material on applicant pools, average SAT scores, acceptance and retention rates and so on is also hit-and-miss. My advice to potential students would be to begin with a large source book or data set that includes the financial, statistical, geographic, programmatic and demographic information in which they might be interested, then home in on a large number of schools. After that you can turn to books like Pope's which give information on the texture and ethos of a given institution. Then it's time for campus interviews, discussions with enrolled students, and closer, more personal examination.Pope's book, it should be noted, has strong biases. His preference is for small institutions that are student-centered, i.e., institutions in which the faculty are principally teachers and not researchers, institutions in which the ethos is very `personal'. By and large, the institutions on which he focuses are less prestigious ones, institutions that `really want you' and will `really appreciate you'. There is no question that some `prestige' is relatively hollow, that statistics can be cooked and that some high-priced institutions do not return value for dollar. At the same time, there are institutions that are not prestigious for good reason. There are institutions that are desperate. There are institutions that offer high touch services in lieu of solid instruction, that balance their books by principally employing part-time faculty. Whether or not Pope's picks are overlooked jewels will also depend on the interests and needs of the individual student. Not all seek the hothouse, village environment. Some want a broader experience. Some want more exotic programmatic opportunities than small liberal arts colleges can provide.The book indulges in some grotesque generalizations: ivy-league schools are scams; students are ignored there; there are no rewards for teaching there; professors do little or none of it; when they teach they only lecture to large groups; in many of these schools you will never be required to write a paper; half of your classes will be taught by adjuncts and many will barely be able to speak English . . . and so on.There is some modicum of truth to these generalizations, but each ivy league school is different and each top-ranked college is different. I teach at an AAU-public, a land grant institution with far more modest tuition than the schools on Pope's list. We are a research institution, likely to be accused of the same sorts of crimes and misdemeanors which Pope finds in top private institutions. Many of our students participate directly in serious and significant faculty research projects that change their lives. Virtually all of the full-time faculty lecture from time to time and virtually all of them teach small classes. This semester I have a class of 29 and a class of 14. Several students are doing special projects (honors work, directed readings, capstone projects) with me. Good teaching is highly prized. We have multiple teaching awards that involve not insignificant financial remuneration. We have distinguished teachers appointed to special Curators' teaching professorships, system-wide awards, college awards, alumni/ae association awards and departmental awards, including awards for both professional advising and mentorship. Nearly all of the institutions against which we measure ourself do as well.Part-time teaching is, indeed, a problem, though it is more likely to be a significant intellectual issue at marginal institutions, whose part-time teachers are often senior graduate students from local research universities or gypsy scholars seeking full-time positions elsewhere. On the other hand, dedicated part-time teachers can be of exceptional value. I spent 17 years as graduate dean at Georgetown. We had a number of programs (Public Policy, National Security Studies, e.g.) which drew on local professionals as part-time faculty. Students were taught by the individuals who actually generated the ideas or directed the programs which they were studying. There are adjuncts who are desperate for work and there are adjuncts who are otherwise-employed professionals who love to teach a single class and do it superbly well.Each student is different and each student seeks an academic experience appropriate to that student's needs and desires. While higher education in America has problems it also offers great diversity in its institutions. Students are best advised to become highly-informed but also to seek an institution in which they themselves are most likely to flourish.

Jonathan Kellerman is not really old, but he is reliable. I read Gone right after the newest Lee Child and still felt that the pacing was appropriate, the characters were interesting, and the plot advanced steadily. I like maximum Milo and minimal Robin/Allison and while the two ladies put in several appearances they play subsidiary roles. The climactic revelations were suitably grisly. All in all, a very polished, smooth read. I disagree with some readers on the specificity of the local color. L.A. is more than a setting for crime fiction; it functions at the level of a major character and Kellerman knows it intimately. Moreover, he does not hesitate to root around in the detritus beneath the freeways. What he finds there is seldom dull.

What is more gratifying and stimulating than observing the work of an absolute master? In what has become an unparalleled series Lee Child offers us a prequel, with fascinating personal elements, plus all the usual--brilliant plotting, skilled characterization, an attractive protagonist, and a wonderful sense of place, the latter all the more impressive considering that Child is an Englishman who characteristically depicts rural as well as urban America. Only one quibble--this time his Englishness peeks through on a couple occasions. Very few Americans would use the word 'greengrocer' and in the U.S. Army we would speak of Armor officers and Armor branch, not Armored. Having said that, the Reacher books remain the standard against which all mystery/thriller writing should be measured. I had a fresh delivery of new books that included THE ENEMY, all books by such masters as Parker, Block, Connelly, Kellerman, and a fugitive title by Charles Willeford. I opened the Amazon box and ripped out THE ENEMY. Dessert first.

Nobody does this better. The ingredients: a former Las Vegas cop turned shakedown artist; a Las Vegas mobster with an informant in law enforcement; a tired but obsessed FBI agent with his eye on the prize--putting the mobster away; a lady judge with an eye for the agent, a small-time financial grifter with an eye for the shakedown artist, a careerist paper pusher constraining the government's investigation and looking out for number one; some hoods who specialize in car bombs and, finally, the FBI agent's loyal partner.Shake and stir and watch the plot lines crisscross on the way to a very satisfying conclusion.This is Petievich's turf: the shadow land between top federal agencies and bottom feeders on the edge of the gutter--the world of the federal working stiff with a thirst for justice; the world of the semi-professional criminal, holding on from day to day.I have liked all of Gerald Petievich's novels. If there is an overlooked classic it may be To Die in Beverly Hills, but all are excellent and Shakedown is a very worthy addition to the list. So meet Eddie Sands, shakedown artist extraordinaire, and meet Special Agent John Novak as he tries to take down Tony Parisi. Set in San Pedro, Beverly Hills and (principally) Las Vegas, this is a fast read that will not disappoint.

This is a classic among the late 20thc studies of American education. It takes as its province the entire spectrum of our educational system, from K-12 to college, graduate school, and beyond. It pulls no punches. The criticism is harsh, the anecdotes salient and nearly every statement is anchored by a specific scholarly or journalistic reference, the endnotes comprising over 50 pp. of text.Thomas Sowell is a trained economist, one of the most lucid expositors of economic principles. He is also a cultural commentator, broadly conceived. I have yet to read one of his books that was not clear, trenchant and bold. He deals in hard facts and common sense and while his orientation is generally characterized as `conservative' he makes his points in persuasive, nonideological ways. When he confronts ideology he counters with empirical evidence. He is a social scientist, not a casual observer. He marshals historical evidence, philosophic evidence and anthropological evidence and always has a fresh slant on much-discussed issues.How candid is he in this book? He argues against racial admission preferences on the grounds that they serve to hurt the minorities they are intended to help. He then demonstrates that there were already concerns that this might prove to be the case, back in the 1960's, on the left as well as on the right. He does this all very dispassionately. He argues that one of the reasons for all of the touchy/feely `affective' education in K-12 results from the fact that education students are the weakest in the university, taught by the weakest faculty in the weakest school, required to take the weakest courses. Their affection for the `affective' derives, in part, from their lack of success in traditional academic subject areas. Hence, they flee from the `basics' because their personal experience with them was unpleasant, even though their very job is to teach the basic, academic subjects and that is what the vast majority of students and parents want them to do. While some of the arguments are carefully modulated there is not a wishy-washy sentence in the book.Some of the book is dated; we have ameliorated some of the concerns of 1993. On the other hand, the majority of the concerns have increased in magnitude. All we need do to bring his arguments up to date is to move the appropriate decimal points or add a more intensive adjective.Still highly recommended.

The jacket art of University Inc. is very misleading. It makes the book look like a popular screed, a bullet-pointed harangue. It is not. This is a very carefully-researched study of the lure of corporatist profits and the effects of those potential profits on higher education. Like many other books on contemporary higher education, it answers the question "Why aren't universities run more like businesses?" Ans.: They already are and often to their detriment as well as the public's.The principal focus of the book, its core, is the 1980 Bayh-Doyle act which allowed universities to reap the profits from patentable research that had been funded by the federal government. In the course of her study, the author suggests ways in which the act should be amended, so that research paid for by taxpayers could be of wider and more immediate benefit to a larger number of people.This is fairly wonky material, though it is presented lucidly. The book is built on scholarly materials but it also utilizes journalistic materials. Prominent, pertinent books on higher education are used, but there are also personal interviews with major players. Some of these, e.g., the author's interview with Michael Crow (former head of tech transfer at Columbia and now president of Arizona State) are very instructive.Washburn is an investigative journalist, not an academic. While that affects the nature of her argument it does not seriously limit it. Many commercial practices in higher education require the searching eye of the investigative journalist, e.g., the fact that big time college athletics nearly always operate at a loss. Most of the journalists who study such issues, however, go for the easy targets. They draw a little blood, push some hot buttons, overlook larger contexts and realities and then move on. This writer is an exception. This is a very thoughtful examination of an important subject.Highly recommended.

Jonathan Creek creates illusions for a smarmy magician. He lives in a windmill that has been in the family for five generations; he's shy, reclusive and generally put off by the oversexed magician who employs him. Maddy Magellan is an indefatigable journalist who partners with Jonathan to solve locked-room and other, seemingly impenetrable mysteries. Jonathan draws on his illusionist's craft to do this and, in the meantime, enjoys the sexual tension with Maddy. The shows are nicely written, well acted, clever romps. While the crimes can be violent, the overall tone is light. The concept behind the stories is very imaginative and the chemistry between the key characters is quite special. Highly recommended.

How did we reach this point? How could we possibly have come to equate acts of great violence with small, sometimes unintended slights? How could we come to characterize our current situation as commensurate with one that has not existed (thankfully) for years? How could we blind ourselves to the nuances of human action? How could we institutionalize ideas so stupid (as Orwell would have said) that only intellectuals could believe them? How could we cavalierly discard due process? How could we come to believe that we could create a world in which no one (or at least 51% of us) would ever feel uncomfortable?Daphne Patai is uniquely positioned to answer those questions because she is a historian, an individual deeply aware of feminist thought and an expert on utopian/dystopian writing. Heterophobia is a superb account of the Sexual Harassment Industry and the ways in which the thought of a few radical feminists has come to permeate our culture in unexpected, seemingly inexplicable ways. Now we know. The book is learned and eminently readable. It is also profoundly reassuring, since it utilizes hard facts and common sense to offer a measured position which can be embraced without apology. The author's reflections on her own experiences are particularly interesting. Our world is not always a fragrant one, as Raymond Chandler famously observed, but attempts to purge it, absolutely, of all unpleasantness result in a different form of inhumanity, one which the vast majority of our fellow citizens would find bland and chilling--a cure that in many ways is worse than the disease, even when that disease is exaggerated, extended and magnified well beyond its core 'realities'. I found particularly interesting the author's discussion of those elements of current thought (sociobiology, e.g.) which are rejected by radical writers simply because those new ideas may conflict with their ideology. We are observing the utilization of what Camille Paglia has described as 'Stalinist' techniques (which, Daphne Patai notes, are also profoundly anti-intellectual) by putative intellectuals. Hence the need for a counter argument, one that also provides an account of the origins of the heterophobic position (and resulting industry). Here it is.

This is my favorite David Lodge novel, one of his `academic' pieces (satires to some, documentaries to others). The powers that be in Birmingham (masked here as Rummidge) have cooked up an industry year scheme in which a university faculty member will shadow a local industrialist so that they might learn from one another. Given the university's disinterest in the project, a vulnerable colleague is chosen--a visiting feminist critic named Robyn Penrose. An expert on the 19thc factory novel, Robyn has never been inside an actual factory. She is to shadow Vic Wilcox, the managing director of a manufacturing firm whose gritty activities are matched by their gritty setting.Robyn and Vic are all oil and water, until, of course, they end up as bedmates. Lodge utilizes their relationship to make trenchant observations on the contemporary academy (in 1988), feminist criticism, town-gown relations, the English novel, the relationship between manufacturing and service economies and sex.Nice Work is funny, poignant, witty, wise and beautifully executed. This is a very fine novel that was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize (though I wouldn't hold that against it). Very highly recommended.

Deer and rabbits are both a blessing and a curse, depending on whether you're an observer or an edible plant. To protect such plants, homeowners use 'deer off' type products, whose smell repels the creatures but does no damage to the flora. It's too early to know whether this product will actually repel the animals, but I can review it as a delivery system.The problem with conventional systems is that they don't usually hold a lot of repellent and their use results in significant finger fatigue. The Havahart system solves those problems. It contains a great deal of material and it is battery-operated. All that you need to do is aim and hold down the trigger until you're finished. The system is well-constructed, utilizes 4 batteries (included) and emits a nice spray.Only one word of advice: you have to turn the nozzle to operate the system. In most spray bottles the nozzle is the nipple-shaped shroud at the end of the spray mechanism. Here, that piece is simply a shroud. You need to remove it and then turn the round end of the nozzle behind it. It doesn't turn easily. I needed to use a pliers to actually do so. Then you replace the blue shroud tip thingie, turn off the safety device and spray to your heart's content.

Once again, we are all in debt to Dennis McMillan for reprinting this Charles Willeford gem. Jesse Sublett discusses the Gold Medal original and the recovered manuscript and speculates on the parts written by Willeford vs. the parts written by his co-author. The overall feel is pure Willeford and many of the chapters are unmistakably his. This is a delicious piece of pulp fiction, beautifully conceived and beautifully plotted. The ending is very satisfying, though a bit unexpected. They don't write 'em like this any more because they can't. We're all overdue for a Willeford revival of the sort Jim Thompson experienced a few years back. This guy can do it all, from the pulpiest confection such as this to a masterful art novel/sendup like THE BURNT ORANGE HERESY. And his two-volume autobiography? Unforgettable. If you don't know Willeford you've got a huge treat in store. Enjoy. Kick back, find yourself a nice comfy chair in a decorous surrounding, hold up your trade paperback copy of KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE and watch the civilians gawk.

Ariel Jardell lives with her adoptive parents, David and Roberta, in Charleston. Their biological child Caleb has died, presumably of SIDS. Roberta has renewed her adulterous affair with Jeff Channing, a local lawyer. Roberta's house freaks her out. Did a woman who killed her children once live there? Is she somehow responsible for Caleb's death? Or did Ariel somehow kill him? Or, for that matter, did Roberta kill him?Roberta is having night visions of a ghost. Sometimes she holds a mirror. Sometimes she holds a rose with blood dripping from the thorns. Is she real? Is she the result of Valium-induced fantasies?What on earth is going on here? The book reads like a straightforward mainstream novel, but with gothic and supernatural elements. Is it an actual ghost story or is it a story of guilt and mental illness, the latter perhaps induced by the former?Some readers have loved the book and some have been baffled by it. Some have found it engaging; others have thought that Lawrence Block is out of his element here, way out of his element.What does your humble reviewer think? I think Lawrence Block is an ambidextrous writer who can do nearly anything he wishes to do. I think Ariel is about the fact that, as Plato put it, we're like charioteers driven by a white horse and a black horse. We try to keep the black horse under control and hopefully, most of the time, we succeed. Sometimes we don't. Sometimes the potential madness and evil in all of us succeeds.Except for a single scene in which Ariel does something that, for her, is unusual and disturbing, an act of self-defense and survival, she is the sanest character in the book. Like any tween-ager on the edge of puberty, lacking any friend except the geeky but engaging Erskine, she sometimes has strange and fantastic thoughts, but with her they are all, ultimately, under control. She is becoming aware of the black horse but she's holding tight on the reins.Finally, Ariel is a strange and interesting coming of age story. Now that she knows that the valley of the shadow of death is just outside the church door and now that she has realized, like the characters in David Lynch's Blue Velvet, that we inhabit two worlds, a conventional comforting one and a disturbing, dangerous one, she will be just fine. Although this is a 1980 book, I'd love to see a sequel--check out what Ariel and Erskine are up to these days.

Nonacademic observers frequently express the wish that universities `be run like businesses'. The (often sad) fact is that they already are so run, to the detriment of academic principle and academic quality. Derek Bok is all too aware of these realities and explores them in this relatively brief book.He is aware of the temptations, of course: big-time college athletics, licensing agreements with sportswear companies, the siren song of institution-saving patent income, the faculty/institutional participation in tech transfer businesses, medical school participation in clinical trials with self-interested pharmaceutical companies, the lure of the internet and mass, for-profit coursework, the exploitation of university extension, the erosion of admission standards in the face of significant development opportunities . . . the list goes on and on.Bok provides a nice enumeration of the temptations, expresses sympathy for universities with regard to conditions that are already too far gone (athletics, the relationships between medical schools and the medical industry, e.g.) acknowledges that survival will generally trump values and principles, shows the pros and cons of commercial activities, relates some horror stories and offers counsel which, if implemented, would help to ameliorate our condition before it is too late.Unfortunately, the advice takes a predictable form. For example, some university research has resulted in triumphs that have changed the institutions which developed the process or made the discovery. One thinks, for example (and Bok notes), Harry Steenbock's process for treating milk so that its constituent vitamin D would eliminate rickets. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (which manages the Steenbock (and other) patent income is one of Wisconsin's major comparative advantages. On the other hand, chasing patent income can often fail; it can divert universities from their fundamental purposes and it can distort their values. Bok then offers a host of examples of things that one might do (increased trustee regulatory oversight, etc.) to ameliorate this situation. However, he also acknowledges the fact that his proposals are unlikely to be a be-all and end-all solution, that there are two sides to this issue, etc. etc.Thus, we get a good elucidation of the potential problems, some examples of how succumbing to the temptations can be deleterious (but with an awareness that the payoffs, if handled wisely, can be very advantageous), some suggestions for muting the problems (with an awareness that they are likely to be insufficient in and of themselves) and a final hope that we will all do good and avoid evil, to the extent possible.The book benefits from Bok's extensive experience and usually clear-headed judgment; it is limited, of course, by the fact that Harvard's `problems' are markedly different from nearly everyone else's. It may have greater temptations but it also has the armor of a multibillion dollar endowment. At one point, for example, he argues that we should be wary of using extension as a cost center (i.e. a cost-generating center) because the college and graduate school (to which extension's `positive variances' would likely be reallocated) already have enough money. Ah, would that that were always so. He also talks about the generosity of the country in funding public education. Not to bite any of the hands which feed us . . . but that allocation now represents a smaller and smaller portion of public universities' total budgets and entrepreneurship (though hopefully not of the whorish variety) is now a university necessity.

When you can't locate that old Jokes for the John tome, reach for Redneck Haiku (and be sure to get the double-wide edition). It meets the critical need for this sort of volume; it can be read quickly. Many of the poems are predictable--dealing with turkey fry incidents, the absence of teeth and presence of highway patrolmen. Some are classics, e.g.:Putting fishhook inchef's masterpiece gets Jake tossedfrom new sushi bar.or:Wedding night fireworksas Flo's ex-husband threatensto bring back the kids.Bacon has a famous line about books, how some are to be tasted while others are to be chewed, digested, etc. This book meets the need for books that need to be consumed quickly, with pages that can be read in any order and at any pace. Throw it to your uncle in the back seat who keeps asking 'if we're there yet'. Throw it to your cousin who's pacing while the women folk get dressed. Take it with you while your car's being repaired or pull it out when that 50-seater hits some turbulence en route to Newark. This is a book suitable for multiple purposes and it delivers nicely.

I'm struck by the response of other Amazon readers. I agree that Coronado is not the equal of one of Lehane's novels, but short stories (and short plays) are seldom the equal of a novel, particularly a novel crafted by a writer as gifted as Lehane. Each of the stories here is dark and each is haunting in its own way. Like any reader, I have my favorite(s), but the collection as a whole carries the Lehane touch. I waited awhile to buy Coronado because, like most readers, I was waiting for the next Lehane novel. Paging through the book it felt odd to me, particularly with a two-act play that grew out of one of the stories. I should have read it earlier. Any 'collection' is, a priori, uneven, but each of the stories held my attention and 'Running out of Dog' and 'Before Gwen' are unforgettable. The stories also take Lehane away from his geographical base and demonstrate the range of his talent. I'm still waiting for that next novel, but Coronado has given me enough of a Lehane fix to help me tolerate the wait.

Great crime writing is not easily accomplished, but the key to it is easily stated--the feel of total freshness accompanied by absolute fidelity to the genre. The new master of this activity is Robert Ferrigno and THE WAKE-UP solidifies his position. The characters are quirky and engaging, the plot unexpected and clever, the one-liners classic. One line in particular sets a new standard. Unfortunately, it cannot be quoted here. It is a world-weary musing on the degree to which every job becomes just that, something you do because you're paid to do it. The line concerns a service-industry worker for the King of Siam. Check it out and then try to forget it. You won't be able to do so.

By all means buy, read, and enjoy this book. The cultural history alone is worth the price. Steve Hodel's father George, the perp according to Steve, lived in a famous house on Franklin in Hollywood, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son. Steve believes this famous house to be the likely site of the murder of Elizabeth Short. One of George Hodel's friends was the photographer and famed artist, Man Ray, some of whose work (Steve believes) bears directly on the case. Steve's mother's first husband was John Huston; in going to Huston for money Steve and his brothers meet Gregory Peck. Perhaps most interesting of all is the suggestion that George Hodel's killing partner, a man named Sexton, might well be the 'swarthy man' responsible for the murder of Geneva Ellroy, James Ellroy's mother.As a former member of the LAPD, Steve offers stories about Parker, Thad Brown, and other worthies at the top of the command chain, some of whom are accused here of perpetrating a mass coverup to protect the identity of George Hodel.The result is a great historical read, whether Steve's argument for his father's guilt is accurate or not. The strongest point in his favor appears to be the handwriting evidence which he adduces. The most curious part of the case concerns the impetus behind the investigation. After his father's death Steve saw his father's prized photo album, which contained a number of pictures of women with whom his father was involved. Lo and behold, smack dab in the middle of the album, there are two pictures of Elizabeth Short! The only problem is that they don't look like her. At all. The high cheek bones are the most notable feature of Elizabeth Short and they're just not there. Nevertheless, Steve (and a DA he enlists to examine his evidence) talk as if there's no doubt about the fact that the pictures are of Elizabeth Short. That doesn't mean that George Hodel didn't kill her, but his son's radically different reading of this bit of evidence raises questions in my mind (it has raised questions in the minds of others as well).

So here's what's up--this is one of the greatest movies of the decade, one destined to be seen as one of the greatest of all times. I do not say that lightly. I am writing from Ebertfest and while there were a number of interesting films screened, this one was in a class by itself.The story: we are in the silent-screen era of Hollywood, in Los Angeles in an unspecified year. A stuntman has been injured in a terrible fall and he is recuperating in a hospital along with a small girl, who has also suffered a fall and broken her arm. They encounter one another and he tells her an epic revenge story about a group of men who have been victimized by an evil governor. As the story develops we see that the individuals participating in the story have their lookalike counterparts among the patients and staff of the hospital. The story is part fantasy/part fairy tale, with scenes in India, Bali, South Africa and points east, west, north and south. The images are breathtakingly lush, though the use of CGI technology was kept to a minimum. What you see is actually what was there. The story is something like Peter Greenaway (on an optimistic day) meets The Princess Bride meets Lawrence of Arabia meets The Wizard of Oz. The evocation of the latter is particularly strong, though the director contends that he has never seen that film.The acting is stunning, particularly that of the injured stuntman and the little girl (Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru). The script is perfectly modulated as it moves between terror, humor, violence and utter sweetness. Ultimately, this is a movie about storytelling, particularly cinematic storytelling. It is a story about the ways in which stories save our lives, shape our world, develop our hearts and minds, stretch our imaginations and instill a sense of awe, wonder and delight. It is richly imagined, deeply moving and exceptionally satisfying.Ebertfest previously advertised itself as focusing upon `overlooked' films. That notion has sometimes been honored in the breach, for well-known films have been screened. The Fall, however, is quintessentially `overlooked' in that it should have received the recognition it deserves: a best picture, best director, best supporting actress and best script nomination at a minimum. This is a dazzling film--haunting, beautiful and in every way delightful. It is a realistic paean to cinema and an exploration of the wonders of the human imagination and the aesthetic forms in which those wonders are realized. Do not miss this film. This is a bona fide life-changer.

First, this is an important book, a book that should be pressed into the palm of every academic in the Humanities. It is, by turns, hilarious and yet very sad. As with the novels of David Lodge, what looks like satire to the average reader looks more like documentary to those who inhabit the enclosed world under examination. There are also allegoric elements and touches of the roman &agrave; clef. Many of the characters in this novel have specific real-world counterparts and they are not difficult to identify. The sadness comes when one realizes the accuracy of the delineation and its proximity to actual circumstances. As the commentary of other reviewers makes clear, the ending is problematic. Although it can be explained, the elements from separable genres which Hynes assembles and the dose of magic realism he adds to the mixture never quite coalesce. The result is that our response to the novel's conclusion is intellectual, while earlier sections of the novel bring on both tears and stomach pains (from laughing). A putatively academic book that is actually very visceral and deeply human ends on a more academic note. Blatant errors of fact (e.g., with regard to the actual governance of universities and the lines of legal authority therein) are unfortunate, since Hynes's knowledge of literature is broad and deep and his understanding of current fads and intellectual enormities is stunningly accurate and precise. The book is still a must-read and some of the portraits (Lester Antilles listening to Kenny G.) are unforgettable. Buy this book.

Great fun; great kitsch. The opening scenes with the obvious rear-screen projection, matte paintings, and intercut desert footage are laughable from a directorial point of view. The plot is stereotypical, but perfect, with unctuous baddies, a mustachioed rival, and uppity leading lady. As soon as Gordon and Kathryn begin to sing, however, we are transfixed, and all of the cinematic hoo-ha dissolves in the schmaltz of Sigmund Romberg. In short, it's delicious, and you succumb to it because the songs are so wonderful. And with Ray Collins as the wise general who helps sort out Arabia, what more could you ask? Note, there really were riffs and they really did have a legendary leader--in Morocco.

This is a fine book and, in some ways, an unexpected one. Kirp is a professor of public policy but this is not a dry data-ridden survey of the commercialization of the academy and its results for policy wonks. On the contrary, it is journalistic in the best sense of that term. Kirp looks at a series of discrete examples exemplifying various aspects of that commercialization and then homes in on the details. The principals involved are quoted and `insider' information is provided. Each chapter is a kind of case study, but written in a way that will both instruct and fascinate the book's readers.Among the subjects included are the unique positioning of the University of Chicago--its special ethos and its struggles to deepen its applicant pools, the building (overnight) of the NYU philosophy department, the budgetary experiments at USC and the University of Michigan, the separatism of the Darden School at the University of Virginia, an internet Classics alliance among several small southern colleges, the British Open University and for-profit institutions such as DeVry.The writing is authoritative, but all is done with a light touch. Each chapter is unique and each is very instructive. The bottom line of course is that while many commentators call for our universities `to be run like businesses' the bitter reality is that they already are, often to their detriment. We have lost our belief that education is a public as well as a private good and we have watched the liberal arts and general education degenerate into smorgasbords of distribution requirements or simply no requirements at all. We have, in short, hastened the advent of a system of higher `education' that is happy to simply offer training, so long as the USNews ratings are high and the bottom line is black.Very highly recommended.

This is an interesting think piece on contemporary higher education. Three of the chapters originated as lectures at the University of Virginia, but the book does not feel disjointed or thrown-together. The issues addressed include the problem of general education, legitimation within the humanities, the homogeneity of professorial political orientations, interdisciplinarity and the university's resistance to change, particularly with regard to seemingly intractable problems.Menand's approach to the issues is historical and the history which he charts is carefully delineated. The writing is lucid, his positions clear. You may disagree with him on a number of points but you always have a clear argument/narrative with which to disagree. When he faces difficult issues he does not hesitate to offer answers and possible explanations.The chapter on general education is, in my judgment, the best and it could well serve as the starting point for further discussions of the subject or further explorations of the issue by college curriculum committees.If there is an overall flaw it is one common to nearly all of the studies of the history of higher education in America. Historians must give significant attention to elite institutions, particularly institutions whose decisions have been watched and replicated by other institutions. And it is fair to ask `what did Harvard decide?' or `what did Yale do in this case?' since American higher education is very imitative.Therein, however, lies the problem. Institutions may have imitated Harvard, but Harvard is such a special case, such an outlier among the 4,000+ institutions of higher education, that the imitation has proven to be extremely wrongheaded. If, for example, Harvard largely abandons general education it is much less of a problem for Harvard than for its imitators, for Harvard has such deep applicant pools that its prep-school and one-of-a-kind-genius public school matriculants will have come to Harvard with a great deal of foundational knowledge/cultural literacy in hand. Students at less-selective institutions will not enjoy these advantages and may be in significant need of general education coursework. The fact that "we" have decided to do something in a particular way may have proven catastrophic for our students, but not for Harvard's, whose ways "we" have been imitating.

I'm keeping an open mind and will see more Wycliffes, but the length of the stories (45-50 minutes) is inadequate for the form. There is not enough time and space in which to develop characters, not enough time and space in which to develop subplots and, hence, mysteries and not enough time to linger over the lush Cornwall settings. I'm not arguing that it's all about the time. Frost is wonderful and only a little bit longer; Midsomer Murders are wonderful but sometimes a bit too long, but the time constraints contribute to the problem that the investigative triumvirs in Wycliffe are not particularly interesting people, the stories are not well-developed and the perps fairly obvious. The guest actors, however, are often excellent, so that there is material on which to build. I'm keeping an open mind, but so far I've found the series a bit dull.

DRAMA CITY is not for the faint of heart, but it is ultimately a story of redemption and not quite as depressing as a wrist-slasher like Mitchell Smith's STONE CITY. It is set in a D.C. where there is no government, no public buildings, no politics, no wealth, no power, few white people and no tourists. It is a city of violence, drugs, decay, poverty and neglect. There are more weeds than flowers, more dirt than grass, more death than life. The protagonist protects animals and he does it with love and care, but, again, there is more sickness than health, more abuse than affection, and omnipresent filth, flies, and disease. This is not for the reader of cozies who waits cheerfully for Parson Smith to solve the case and put society back on a happy, even keel. This is gritty realism, so gritty at times as to be less than fully realistic. The writing is excellent, the characters fully realized, the setting nailed. About two-thirds of the way through, as the plot lines converge and the suspense accelerates, it is almost pleasant. Most of the time, however, it is a book to admire rather than enjoy.

It has been said that a great biography requires that the biographer respect and love his subject. Sayer certainly meets that requirement. As a friend and former student of Lewis', he is able to offer unique anecdotes and a personal perspective to illuminate his subject. He is also a student of literature, so that he is able to comment on Lewis' work in a professional and sometimes incisive manner. I particularly enjoyed the fact that he includes an Afterword in which he answers the most common questions he has received as one of Lewis' principal biographers. He also includes information which does not always reflect favorably on Lewis. While he loves Lewis the book is not idolatrous. He sees him as a living, breathing, flawed, but wonderful human being. My only problem with the book lies in the fact that Sayer does not linger over dates. From time to time the reader has to reconstruct the narrative by repositioning the book's events within specific years and decades. This is not a major problem, but it is a problem. All in all, this is an engaging study of an engaging subject. Highly recommended.

Melissa Leo hasn't really left, but she hasn't been featured in roles deserving of her talent. One of the standouts of the great series, Homicide, she here plays an upstate New York mother, trying to tie a knot as she hangs at the end of her rope. Joining forces with a Mohawk woman, whose family is also under stress, she drives across a frozen river to smuggle illegal immigrants into the country. While this generates some cash flow, it brings her into contact with some dangerous people. Plus there's that river which might thaw in the wrong place at the wrong moment. Fortunately she's packing a revolver and a lot of moxy. This is a spare, moving, small-budget narrative that works in every way. It's a little difficult to watch, what with the desolate lives and the everpresent snow, ice and mud, but there is a not inconsiderable degree of redemption waiting at the end. Welcome back, Melissa and your fine supporting cast.

In The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch mentions the importance of Haven in a Heartless World as a prelude document. Among other things, Lasch attributes the culture of narcissism to an attempt by various social agencies, academics, health professionals and bureaucrats to create space for themselves by proposing ways of solving problems that are ultimately unsolvable. We begin our lives with a sense of loss, the world being a colder and more difficult place than the warmth and freedom from responsibility afforded by the womb. Enter the professional nurturers who will build careers for themselves by promising to remedy that sense of loss through their various ministrations (which, once applied, prove to be more problematic than the ills they have purported to cure).Haven in a Heartless World looks at the displacement of family responsibility by such individuals. Beginning in the nineteenth century, Lasch works his way forward principally through the study of sociological literature, most of which he finds radically wanting. While I agree with Lasch's critics that he spends less time articulating his own advice and principles than one might wish, his command of the literature at his disposal is very, very impressive. Haven in a Heartless World does not utilize the broad cultural materials of The Culture of Narcissism but it is an important step on the way to Lasch's major book.While not inaccessible to general readers, Haven in a Heartless World will be of particular interest to sociologists and other social scientists. It remains relevant today, even though it appeared over three decades ago.

It would be impertinent to call this novel 'Nostromo lite' because it is much more than that. Basically this is an account of the effects of war upon a continent and the manner in which smaller murders link with larger ones. It recalls Conrad's masterpiece, 'Nostromo' in the breadth of its canvas, the mixing of its time levels and the deft matching of historical sweep with personal detail. With the exception of a few howler purple passages, the writing is effective (though not at Conrad's level) and the period detail, geography, and plot architectonics are very impressive. This is a serious and significant piece of crime fiction. And with Nazis! If it is not quite up to the level of a master like Conrad it still manages to transcend genre in important ways. At the same time it is faithful to genre in lovely ways, from the delineation of a lonely, tenacious protagonist to the depiction of a nearly-hollow universe. Also a must read for anyone interested in Portugal and post-war history.

Those familiar with Kenneth Branagh's Wallander series will find a nice parallel in Single-Handed. Jack Driscoll is a Garda Sergeant on the West Coast of Ireland. Filmed in Connemara (and we get a glimpse of the Connemara ponies in episode three), the landscape is stark, wind-swept and wet. No one lives close to one another, but all know each other's secrets. The secrets involve sex, incest, murder and drugs (and that's just the beginning).Jack's father Gerry preceded him in the job. Gerry was an effective copper but not always a very nice man. He bent the rules. He sinned. He hurt people. Jack's backstory and his family story are interwoven with the cases he is asked to solve, so that we get freestanding stories combined with an overarching plot.The writing is superb, the atmosphere just this side of bleak. The stories are sometimes slow to develop, the background score haunting. These are crime stories for the connoisseur of British drama. Owen McDonnell is excellent in the lead role, his father Gerry (played by Ian McElhinney) a close second. The Guinness is lush and rich, the blood flowing.Don't miss this one.

Reading Therapy is therapeutic, but then reading any David Lodge novel is therapeutic, because they are inevitably funny, witty, wise, touching and sweet. Therapy is the putative 'journal' of Laurence "Tubby" Passmore, a successful TV sitcom writer whose personal life has soured. He's trying analysis, aromatherapy, acupuncture and platonic romance but nothing quite eases the angst or ameliorates the psychic pain. Eventually he tries a pilgrimage (in several senses of the word) and (well, I can't spoil the ending, but it's David Lodge, so that you know the ending will be satisfying).This is one of Lodge's best--right up there with Nice Work, Paradise News and his newest novel, Deaf Sentence. There are also some long reflections on Kierkegaard, which are great fun and, as always with Lodge, insightful. If you're feeling blue, save your money. Don't pay for analysis, acupuncture or aromatherapy. Read Therapy.

There is no official 'biography' of the band, but there are many filmed bits and pieces floating around that are familiar to Moody fandom. This dvd, however, brings together a plethora of fresh material that not only provides a rich sense of the band's history and the sources of its success, but also answers questions concerning the departures from the band of Denny Laine, Mike Pinder, and Ray Thomas. It is exceptionally candid. Things are said that one does not expect to hear said in a day of rabid, unending litigation. There are some omissions--no interviews with Gordon Marshall or Paul Bliss (nor from Patrick Moraz, though no one would expect him to make himself available) and the odd overlooking of the Keys to the Kingdom album and some other later work. It is especially nice to see the members of the band in their native habitats--Justin in Monaco, Graeme in Florida, etc.The focus is exclusively on the music; there is nothing, e.g., on John's love of golf and Rhone wines or on any of the band's philanthropic work. There is also next to nothing on their families, except for some asides on key divorces. The subsidiary material on the second disc (fulsome video of the garden party launch for Octave, e.g.) is also worthwhile. This dvd does not tell you everything but it tells you much more than you might expect and the production values are very high. Moody fans will also recognize some of their number in the audience and actually hear a few of them interviewed.Highly recommended; don't miss it.

Damrosch's biography of Rousseau is a fine piece of work--complete, readable and attentive to nuance and detail. It is said that a successful biography requires a sympathetic writer, one who respects and, hopefully, reveres his subject. This is not easy for the biographer of Rousseau, who was notoriously difficult with his friends. Suspicious to the point of paranoia, he always suspects plots and betrayals. Sometimes he is available, sometimes not. Sometimes he embraces, sometimes he avoids.Rousseau's first play was entitled Narcissus, or the Self-Lover, a subject that evokes no surprises from those familiar with his life and thought. A palpitating mass of feelings, with tears flooding from his eyes, he was, nevertheless, an extremely influential writer (for good or ill).Damrosch calls him a `restless genius' and that is as positive as Rousseau probably deserves. His life was far less eventful than the intellectual and cultural currents which flowed from his writings, but he felt its moments more deeply than anyone might reasonably expect and built a career on them.The book is a pleasure to read and it includes both contemporary illustrations and photographs taken by the author. The annotation is full, but done with a light hand so as not to impede the reader. My sole disappointment was the brief attention given to Rousseau's works. They are located within the scenes of his life and they are very briefly summarized but the focus of the book falls on Rousseau's life, not his thought and not his writings. The reader who wishes more information on the latter will have to seek it elsewhere, though the rudiments are spelled out here.This is a serious biography that will be useful to scholars but accessible for the general reader.

This Lynda LaPlante project recalls key elements of the Prime Suspect series--a solid, shrewd female investigator leads a team of assistants in solving a heinous crime. In this case, however, the woman is replaced by a man who keeps her in the loop and works with her as a trusted partner. A prime suspect is identified and the case is pursued through its many stages until we reach the trial. When new information surfaces during the trial the detectives are back in the field again, racing against the clock to find a crucial bit of evidence. The setting, the characters, the relatives of the victim and the perpetrator are all gritty. This is East London: gray bordering on grim, definitely not theme-park Britain. The direction is somewhat odd, with ample use of split-screen images, some of which work and some of which merely seem odd. There are inconsistencies in the evidence and shaky elements in the plot, just as in real life. Set 1 involves the abduction, abuse and murder of a small child. Steel yourself. It certainly will hold your attention. Nonsmokers: prepare yourself for profuse smoking by many of the principals. As the chief investigator says, 'if you don't smoke you shouldn't be in this job.'

I was very disappointed in this film, particularly after the hype. The cinematography is very impressive; visually, the film is beautiful. Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent, but not drop-dead exceptional. Comparisons with his performance in Gangs of New York are apt. The score is striking in its minimalism and insistence, but after awhile it becomes grating and annoying. Ciaran Hinds is wasted and the other supporting performances are little more than window dressing for DD-L. This is a virtuoso role as well as a virtuoso performance and everyone else is secondary at best. The movie is long (2 1/2 hours+), but, surprisingly, the story is undeveloped. There is a great temporal gap between the final, pivotal scene and those that precede it. There is also nothing about the lead character's youth in Wisconsin. He springs full born as an adult. That would not normally be a problem, but the story here is one of passionate greed and lust for control that devolves into madness. It would be nice to see that pattern and process's origins. It is sometimes said that we come to have affection for radically-flawed or even evil characters when we get to know them intimately, since to understand is to forgive, but there are really no central characters in this film who enjoy the audience's affection. Plainview's deaf son is a possible exception, but he does not exhibit a morality of his own until he is utterly brutalized by his adoptive father. Prior to that he is a blank-stare cipher who accepts his father's ways.Some did not enjoy No Country for Old Men, but it is really the diametric opposite of There Will Be Blood. The plot is airtight; the ensemble cast is superb; the film has a major, significant point (the ravages of drugs and their impact on a society) and, for all its grimness, a sense of minimal redemption in Tommy Lee Jones's character. It is also beautifully shot--a complete work of art.

This is a unique book, constructed out of common elements. It is part Hitchcockian 'average guy meets apparently average guy and disasters ensue', part crime novel, part love story, part fairy tale. The plot is wildly implausible but extremely engaging. The characters are not very likable, but they are still interesting. It is a fast, one-sitting read that picks up impressive momentum in the third act. If you summarize the plot aloud you begin to ask yourself, 'what was this thing that I just read?' Though apparently serious in subject, it is not always serious in tone, and much of the action descends into farce. Hence the sense of uniqueness. As Johnson said of the metaphysical poets, the elements of their works are yoked together with a degree of violence. Thus, this book feels forced, but it seizes your attention and doesn't let go until the fairy tale ending. I highly recommend it, but with the caveat that much of the book's uniqueness results from the fusion of discordant elements.

This may be David Lodge's best novel, though I love Nice Work, Therapy, Deaf Sentence and Small World. It is pure Lodge--a comic masterpiece with a serious core. Bernard Walsh is a former priest who comes to Oahu to visit his dying aunt. His dyspeptic father accompanies him and promptly walks into oncoming traffic. The driver who puts his father in the hospital then falls in love with Bernard. Along for the trip are a group of quintessentially British holiday makers, including the tanning bed salesman from Nice Work, Brian Everthorpe. The undercurrents of the novel are theological, with extended ruminations on faith and the possibilities of a heavenly paradise, in addition to the plasticized variety represented by Waikiki. The hallmark of a great Lodge novel is its balance--a balance between humor and pathos, two-dimensional and three-dimensional characters, academic theorizing and recalcitrant reality, jokes, whimsy and the truly profound. Paradise News is a perfect example of Lodge's skills and his deepest novelistic intentions. The book will make you laugh and it will make you cry. It is thus, in the deepest sense of the word, therapeutic, as great novels should be. Do not miss it.

If Coben is not a member of your stable of regular reads, add him to the list. His plotting is expert and his characters are engaging and fun. Myron is a nice blend of Parker's Spenser and Crais's Elvis Cole. The over-the-hill athlete is a nice fixture in crime fiction and this one, a lawyer/sports agent/investigator pursues a unique combination of activities. His lethal preppie sidekick Win is a category fiction staple, but Win's unprepossessing exterior and stone killer ways also represent a unique combination. The pages fly by and the skill level is high. Enjoy.

I loved the Parker novel on which the film is based and the film is worthy of the novel. Harris' direction is superb; the period details are spot-on and the script is lean and Parkeresque. It is a story of friendship, of friendship between men. As such, more is left unsaid than is said. The fact that things need not be said is the whole point. Everyone will think of Spenser and Hawk and that is fair, but I think as well of the laconic Jesse Stone, another Parker creation which has resulted in excellent film adaptations. Remember always that Parker is an English Ph.D., one who understands genre at the deepest level. Thus, this is a western in the purest sense. The story is relatively familiar (as western stories always are) and the experience of watching it is one that borders on ritual and sacrament. We know that we are entering a certain ethos and we know what will happen there. We pray that we won't be disappointed. Here, we are not disappointed. It is not as operatic as the Sergio Leone films can be, but it is respectful, almost worshipful, of the world which the genre celebrates. This is first-rate work, an exquisite film.

The Nasty Bits is largely a collection of previously-published pieces, some of which appeared in different form. They deal with all aspects of foodiedom--international cuisines, celebrity chefs, indigenous vs. scientific cookery, PETA, kitchen demographics . . . you name it, it's here and it's described with Tony's incisive, knowledgeable, snarky, politically incorrect, hypercritical, sometimes worshipful style. The language is rated R and so is some of the content.Interestingly, the separate pieces are followed by a commentary section in which Tony looks back over the pieces, contextualizes them in time and, in some cases, criticizes them harshly. This is very sneaky, in that it gives him the chance to have his cake and then enjoy eating it. A piece on New York, for example, celebrates the pre-Giuliani days of dope, danger, sex, belligerent panhandlers and general atmosphere of personal threat. Then, in the commentary section, he describes it as glib and over-romanticized. "What a twat I was when I wrote this," he confesses. The result is that when a reader disagrees or is offended with him, he turns around and congratulates the reader in the commentary section, saying, in effect, `You're right; I was a jerk to say that.'He walks a delicate line, of course. As I've said of his other books, we read them not just for the information and the insight, but to enter Tony's world, to hear his unique voice and receive his unique take on things. If he is tamed (as he is by the commentary section) we lose something of the authentic Tony. At the same time, the authentic Tony is indeed sometimes juvenile and off-putting, as for example in his piece on Singapore where he assures us of his gratefulness for the availability of oral sex in a place which criminalizes it. The Nasty Bits is not nasty to a fault. It is interesting throughout and when it steps over the line the `commentary' section puts things right again.Bonus: the book includes a fictional Christmas story that draws together a number of issues raised in the book (celebrity chefdom, the economic conditions of the Manhattan food scene, the competitiveness therein and the need for luck and good timing). Double bonus: it has a happy ending.

This novel has received great acclaim and a succession of awards. A hard-edged 'village' cozy, it is ambitious in its reach and largely successful in its execution. Caveat emptor, however. The first half is very, very slow, while the second half flies. It tries your patience but then rewards it. It also meet the full expectations of genre, by being both 'unique' and 'faithful' simultaneously. However, while it looks very different from most novels of its kind it is, simultaneously, extreme in its conventionality.It is a novel within a novel and, hence, recalls the 18th- and 19th-century antecedents in which a created narrative voice is seen from multiple time levels. The usual form is one in which an individual has found an earlier document and 'edits' it. Alternatively, a figure in the present examines a document from the past and the time/past and time/present narratives exist in parallel. This is a common 20th-century variant on the earlier models. A PLACE OF EXECUTION builds on this model, successfully, and then offers a 'twist' ending. The 'twist', however, is also a very conventional one. Christie readers, e.g., will not be surprised.Thus, in retrospect, the novel is a conventional one, but it does not feel conventional while one is reading it. In part that is due to its length and the heavy texturing which characterizes the first half. DO read it, but gird yourself for a 'cozy' conclusion following a near-epic exposition.

First, I recommend C. O. DeRiemer's plot summary (currently the lead review on the Amazon site). It offers nice details (with some spoilers) to flesh out the basic story: George Smiley is called out of retirement by a wartime colleague to investigate a letter from a woman at a very British public school in Dorset. The woman believes that her life is in danger and that her husband may kill her. Smiley investigates (meekly and mildly, but devastatingly effectively) and is later aided in the case by his friend, Alisa. The latter is played by Glenda Jackson, Smiley by Denholm Elliott. Along with a series of British character actors, Jackson and Elliott are joined in this story by Joss Ackland and a teenage Christian Bale.In some ways the story is quite traditional--violence in an academic setting that is replete with gossip, backbiting, sexual misbehavior (both gay and straight) and fine claret. The difference is that few such crimes are solved by the likes of George Smiley. Elliott is superb in the role--pitch perfect I would say--and so are Glenda Jackson and Joss Ackland in support. Matthew Scurfield, playing the local detective inspector (chain smoking but always bumming cigarettes) is also excellent, complete with wry lines, a bad haircut and untied coat belt. Bale seems awkward in the role of a schoolboy with shaky grades.The writing is excellent and it's a pity that many American viewers will have difficulty following it. The dialogue is replete with British idiomatic expressions, the sound levels fluctuate and the direction is very choppy, as if certain scenes were left out or have been edited in slightly improper order. Crank up the volume; you may wish to view the film twice to catch all of the details. It is worth doing so for the writing and for the individual performances.

A Touch of Frost has been on the British telly for 17 years. All good things must end. British coppers must retire at 60; Sir David is 70 and felt that the series had to end because of the implausibility of Frost still being on the force at his advanced age. Here is the conclusion and what a conclusion it is. Three endings were shot and Sir David was permitted to choose the ending that he preferred. (How often would that have happened in Hollywood?) I believe that he chose the wrong ending. I won't spoil it, but I would have chosen alternate ending number one. (Both alternate endings are included as special features.) All three of the endings are powerful and plausible; I like alternate number one because of its roundedness and because it ennobled. You have to watch to see what I mean.The concluding episode is a very powerful two-parter, with an A and B plot. The A plot concerns a drug dealer with a dog fighting operation on the side. This very unsavory character is a hateful bully with a sleazoid solicitor, both of whom enjoy badgering Frost. The B plot involves a set of crimes from the past which are being replicated in the present. In effect, the ending represents Frost's future (or lack of it, depending on the ending), the A plot his present, the B plot his past. It is all very tight, very tidy and very moving.Although we are in the gritty world of Denton, the Thames Valley and slimeball criminals, the A plot nearly takes on the dimensions of Greek drama. The characters are powerful, the acting superb, the conclusions shattering. With every fine story of detection there is often a parallel personal story. In this case, Frost finds a love interest, a woman who cares for the animals who are victimized and who simultaneously witnesses a murder. This makes her a target for the threats and assaults perpetrated by the criminal in the A plot. Frost needs her as a witness, but also wants her as a friend and lover. Played by the estimable Phyllis Logan, one of Michael Kitchen's frequent co-stars, this character provides an important dimension as Frost contemplates possible futures.I can only say that this is some of the finest television I have ever seen and a value at twice the price. (Note: despite what one reviewer said, the dvd does include subtitles, though, as always, they appear to have been done by someone who does not understand British English.) I hated to see the series end, but what a spectacular ending. The writing is heart-rending, the acting soaring.Do not miss this one.

A Taste for Death is one of P.D. James's classics and the plot and characters hold up in this film version. Dalgleish is investigating the death of a Tory M.P. and cabinet appointee whose death is staged to look as if it were a suicide. Curiously, the death occurs in a Paddington church and the M.P. is accompanied (in death) by an alcoholic tramp. Suspects abound. The M.P. had a mistress; his wife has a lover; that lover is sleazy; the wife has an equally sleazy brother; the cook/maid in the family house is angry and bitter; the house driver is an ex-Military man who has maintained his physical strength; the church altar lady is losing her faith; she is accompanied by a young boy who lives mostly on the streets because his mother is a prostitute; Special Branch has been investigating the M.P. and may have tried to put in some sort of fix at CID and, oh yes, the M.P.'s mother is an embittered atheist who long ago lost her husband and her son (who was previously engaged to the M.P.'s wife, who, I should have mentioned earlier, is pregnant). If that's not enough, the priest at the Paddington church thinks that he may have seen evidence of the stigmata on the M.P.'s wrists. Though plausibility is stretched, it all more or less works and the supporting roles are played expertly. Wendy Hiller plays the mother, Simon Ward the sleazy lover and Avril Elgar steals the show as the cook/maid.Now about those bookends. The story begins with some outside scenes in which the sound is, literally, awful. All of the ambient noise (including the wind blowing into the microphone)drowns out the dialogue. This is amateurish in the extreme. The story ends with a storming-of-the-flat scene in which the British equivalent of a SWAT team converges, clumsily, on the apartment in which the killer is holding two individuals. The team is large enough to attack/defend an entire village, though it doesn't really succeed at its task. When the perp is frog-walked to a police vehicle it looks like three crazed sprinter/drunks trying to run and simultaneously hold each other up. Just prior to that scene Dalgleish mans a megaphone in an attempt to persuade the perp to throw down his arms and give up. The megaphone is held against the door and the resulting sound is ridiculous in the extreme. The overall result is comic and campy and undercuts the seriousness of the narrative.Still and all, the video is worth watching, particularly for the supporting performances.

We all love to hear Elvis Cole's wisecracks and watch Joe Pike take down bad guys. At the same time, it's nice to see Robert Crais do a love story, in this case a story about a man's love for his son and his possible love for a woman.The story is tight, the characters engaging, the ending satisfying, and even though the ending is telegraphed to an extent it still brings with it an element of surprise.The subtext: honor among thieves. Of the purest variety.

It's nice to see Woody shooting in an exotic setting, but there's little here of Barcelona proper aside from a brief sampling of Gaudi architecture and a scenic street/alleyway. Several scenes appear to be of the Rambla, but they are tight shots, not long shots, so one does not have the full effect. That is not to say that the film is not beautiful. It is simply not an extended, loving portrait of Barcelona. That is somewhat surprising, since the film is part 'Americans Abroad' in the sun, getting into romantic situations they would otherwise avoid and part Almodovar, with passionate lovers fondling one another one moment and shooting at one another the next. The 'Americans Abroad' theme dominates. Its separate scenes are linked by an ongoing voiceover which I found to be intrusive and inauthentic. The film comes alive when Penelope Cruz enters, but the film lacks the exquisite script, urgency and momentum that one expects from Almodovar. Sorry, as Simon Cowell would say, but this was slow, very slow.

You don't have to be obsessed with wine to enjoy this book, since it concerns the impact of an individual on an industry as much or more than the technical aspects of contemporary winemaking. Hence, the book is part food/wine, part biography, part social history, part economic history, and part cultural history. It is also very important, since the impact of this single individual on a vast industry is--for good or ill--an important fact of life. It is also a very interesting story, as so many of the lives of those connected with the making and appreciation of wine tend to be. Elin McCoy is a knowledgeable commentator and her inclusion of a wine glossary is both helpful and useful.The book is perhaps most interesting in its confirmation of the fact that a single individual can have an immense impact on our world. The author also manages to tease out the sometimes unexpected details that contribute to the larger story, e.g., Addy Bassin's willingness to share his mailing list with Parker, a crucial element in Parker's success. How many people drive past Bassin's MacArthur Liquors every day, unaware of the fact of its role in shaping the world's wine industry? As a steady customer of Bassin's during my 17 years in Washington, D.C. I was pleased to see the author's awareness of its importance.

In Pie in the Sky, the great British character actor, Richard Griffiths, plays Henry Crabbe, a copper who's done his 25 and wants to open a restaurant. As it turns out he's forced to continue policing, but he does get to open his restaurant, Pie in the Sky. PitS is referred to as 'your cafe' by his unctuous superior, who has blackmailed him into continuing on the force, working on special projects, i.e. projects which would be of benefit to the superior in his career. Things don't exactly work out that way, as Henry is able to be true to himself and to his diners. This is an interesting concept--appealing to both foodies and mystery buffs--and it works. It works because of Griffiths, but a strong supporting cast and a series of interesting scripts helps. This is light entertainment with an occasional serious moment. Best of all, the original episodes are approximately 48 minutes in length, so that you can watch 1, 2 or more at a time, depending on your mood. There's no hour-and-forty-minute commitment at the get-go. Watch for Michael Kitchen as the baddie in the opening episode.

This is an interesting and informative book. Written by the former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, it is a useful introduction to research-university and research-college culture. It is written with grace and humor and includes sufficient data to support its authority and sufficient anecdotal material to support its wisdom.It is also a very limited book. It offers a sense of the `feel' of administration, the daily life of a dean, the nature of university relationships, principles and values. It is an account of university `culture'. It has almost nothing to say about the external forces that impinge on universities and the individuals (and share of the budget) devoted to dealing with them. It acknowledges the presence of university critics but opts for optimism rather than pessimism, even as it notes that some of the critics' claims are legitimate (grade inflation, trendy curricula, e.g.). Rosovsky's personal impulses are `old Harvard': moderate/liberal, northeastern and boosterish with a dab of sherry here and a love of crimson, silk robes there. The fact that he is an economist with an Asian area studies emphasis adds both rigor and breadth to some of his insights. The thrust of his comments is one of reassurance. "Here are the reasons for our procedures; they are rational and both tried and true."The book should be of great interest to keepers of the Harvard flame. He describes the book as an `owner's manual'; it is actually a stakeholders' manual. Stakeholders are not the same as owners and the stakeholders here (Harvard students, Harvard faculty, Harvard alumni/ae, Cambridge residents and so on) will be interested in how the academic core of this particular University functions.The problem for the rest of the reading public will be that Harvard is such an exception to the experience of nearly all other American institutions, including those whose stature approaches Harvard's. Its endowment, for example, offers it opportunities which few others enjoy; at the same time its dependency upon its endowment makes it subject to far greater threats when the market tanks. Its tenuring procedures are similar to a tiny handful of other institutions but markedly different from nearly everyone else's, including the 60+ members of the Association of American Universities--the top private/public research universities in America. Harvard does not tenure associate professors; nearly everyone else does. Harvard thus has a longer probationary period for junior staff, but then it requires candidates for tenure to compete with anyone and everyone outside of Harvard in the field in question. Harvard's every-tub-on-its-own-bottom budgeting is enormously expensive because it is duplicative. Its traditional `section man' teaching format, with large lectures presided over by tenured faculty with breakout sections managed by graduate students makes for larger class sizes than its cost and reputation would lead one to expect. Its size is relatively large and the number of professional students there creates an ethos that is not only vastly different from that of research colleges but also differently-proportioned than, e.g., top public institutions.These are more descriptions of the book than criticisms of the book. I believe that nearly all of the author's values, instincts and principles are solid ones. He has actually written a superb book, but one whose title should have been something like "The Culture and Governance of the Arts and Sciences at Harvard University--A Stakeholder's Introduction."

What a pity it is that films such as this are virtually unthinkable in contemporary culture. Explicitly Christian but not preachy or sectarian, it offers a universal message as appropriate at Christmas as any other time. The galaxy of stars (Young, Grant, Niven) and excellent supporting cast are used to great advantage. Goldwyn had thought of Niven in what became the Grant role, but Grant wisely persuaded him to cast it in its present form. 'Heartwarming' is the word that most quickly comes to mind, something that is just as necessary today as it was in 1947. The Bishop's Wife is a romantic comedy without sex, a reflection on wealth and religion without anger or bitterness and a reflection on essential human good without soppy sentimentality. It is hopeful without being doctrinaire and sweet without being saccharine. We would not want a current array of films that only included works such as this, but it would be nice to have a few from time to time. If you have not seen it, do so. It will lift your spirits.

The Haunted Wood capitalizes on the temporarily-opened archives of the KGB and the fruits of the VENONA deciphering project to trace the pattern of Soviet espionage in the U.S. during the Stalin era. It traces the experiences of individual spies and their handlers, so that there are mini-narratives within the overarching narrative of pre-Cold War espionage. The Soviets were interested in everything, including industrial secrets (at the level, e.g., of formulas for cosmetics) and there were those willing to provide them with those secrets, including a succession of individuals within the Roosevelt administration itself. (President Truman was far less sympathetic to the communists and reduced their numbers within his government.) In general, the 'idealistic' spies conducted their operations without compensation, many of them motivated by antifascist beliefs as well as pro-communist ones. The virtues of the book are its authenticity, objectivity and accuracy. It does not set out to hurl charges, wave flags and shout the words 'traitor' and 'treason'. What it does instead is make the case, convincingly, that the hard evidence exists and can no longer be denied. There were significant traitors within our society and within our government and that fact is now beyond dispute.The book is somewhat 'archival' in its tone, since it is, of course, archival in its sources. Hence, the book is scholarly, empirical, and a tad dry. It is not a 'thriller' narrative with cliffhanger chapter endings and larger than life characters. It is a straightforward account, with names, dates and references, explaining the nature and extent of treasonous behavior at the highest reaches of our government. Others may be particularly taken with other aspects of this story. What interested me was the fact that the American spies went about their 'idealistic' business in the face of the great Stalin purges of the late 1930's. One might have thought that that 'idealism' would have given way to a degree or two of realism in seeing the nature of the government for which they were betraying their own.

Check out the other Amazon reviews. The commonalities are clear. No one is more consistent than Burke. No one writes with the lush, lyric beauty of this man, who has been called the Faulkner of crime fiction. It is particularly poignant to read CRUSADER'S CROSS in the wake of Katrina's devastation; the sense of loss--already powerful in Burke's writing--is magnified. No one can match his sense of place.In this novel Dave's struggles with the past are amplified by the presence of his brother, Jimmie, and--as always, the presence of Clete Purcel adds a further dollop of violence, impulsiveness, and borderline irrationality which somehow simultaneously reinforces our sense of justice achieved. There is a shortage of courtroom mysteries and reviewers of such novels sometimes indicate to readers and devotees the proportion of the narrative that transpires in the courtroom proper. With a Burke novel I want to know how many scenes there are featuring Clete Purcel, Burke's Hawk. There are never enough, of course, but there are enough here to satisfy the most demanding reader.The key to the Robicheaux novels is that it is impossible to rank them in terms of quality and accomplishment. Their hallmark is their creator's dazzling consistency.

The new Lee Child is, of course, superb. The quality of his writing is unerringly even and unerringly high. He sets the standard for suspense writing. The savvy behind his craft is apparent in The Hard Way, since the canvas is very narrow and potentially even claustrophobic. The bulk of the novel is set in Manhattan, with strict geographic constraints. The latter portion of the novel is set in East Anglia, but again, with constraints. This could be a textbook case for aspiring crime writers--contrast this book with, e.g., Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code. All three novels are suspenseful, but look at the lengths (thematic, geographic, etc.) to which Dan Brown must go to create the suspense. Lee Child achieves greater suspense within great constraints. That could be part of the definition of masterful genre writing.Now for the mini-protest. Lee, we love you, but we need a more violent ending. A major catharsis requires a major blood-letting.

Readers expecting as many laughs as Dave Barry provided in this novel's predecessor are likely to be disappointed. The good news is that the story is tighter. Essentially, a collection of wacky characters travel from different directions, ending at a single plot point from whence a succession of conclusions (all mostly satisfying) follow. We are still very much in Carl Hiaasen's Florida, depicted with Dave Barry's rhetorical techniques. The problem is that the vehicle chosen--converging plot lines with quick-cuts between them just at the moments of maximum tension--requires that we care about the characters in order to be effective. When the characters are stereotypical (or identified by minimal, sometimes scatological, details) we tend to lose that necessary interest and the whole house of cards collapses. Bottom line: wait for the paperback.

This reprise of The Count of Monte Cristo (in modern times) is very readable--a feast of nonstop melodrama. The characters are slightly over the top; the settings are slightly over the top; the actions are slightly over the top and the violence is perfect. Upstate New Yorkers will particularly enjoy it--with scenes in Syracuse, Auburn and the finger lakes. This is my first Tim Green novel, so I have nothing to compare it with. The writing is slick, the plotting deft, the 'unputdownable' factor approaching 100%. This is the perfect airplane read.

For those with a taste for classic noir involving the long con, welcome to genre heaven. This forty year-old stunner could have been written yesterday. It's not just classic Block; it's mature Block. The writing is as slick as the seat of an accountant's pants and the plot is flawless. Although it's extremely different, the novel reminded me of the film A SIMPLE PLAN. From scene one you know that this story is going nowhere good. The plan is too simple, the characters too devious, the pitfalls too plentiful.With a true masterpiece of genre fiction the reader simultaneously surrenders to the plot while second-guessing the author. You know that the linear plot will go awry; you also know the ways in which it is likely to go awry; you know the dimensions of the consequences in each case and, hence, the stakes. You also know that Block knows all these things and that he may be working with you or against you.Block's forte is the ability to master genre while appearing to write effortlessly and simply. Of all the master crime writers out and about, Block is the one who always makes it look easy. We know how hard that is to do. Here is an absolute gem. Enjoy.

Classic hardboiled detective fiction, that is. With every t crossed and i dotted: a down-on-his-luck shamus with a taste for rye and a Bowery address, a femme fatale or two, a client who may not be what he seems, some toughs with lead pipes and blackjacks and cops who know how to interrogate without leaving bruises. The plot is tight and the whole thing works. Well. The language is 48 years old, but that adds to the charm, as do the elements of period material culture. Early work from a grand master. Go for it.

In And Flesh and Blood So Cheap, Joe Hannibal meets and falls for a journalist named Jan Mosby. In The Fight In The Dog, Jan has moved to Chicago and is writing for a prominent magazine. Her elderly neighbor's dog is stolen from a strip mall parking lot and Jan and Joe are drawn into the world of high-stakes, big-money dog fighting.Dogs are acquired/stolen by `bunchers' who assemble groups of them. Some are sold for research, some may be sold for human consumption; many are sold for dog fighting. The unfortunate, weaker dogs are used as simple fodder for the more aggressive dogs, developing in them a taste for blood and a need to kill.In The Fight In The Dog, Joe and Jan are dealing with a perverse, rich dog-fighting impresario, the biker gang which he employs for security and general dirty work, the rich man's ex girlfriend, her transexual friend, a vicious Texas dog trainer, a slow-witted wannabe anxious to please the bikers, his wheelchair-bound father and miscellaneous members of law enforcement. The cast of characters is rich and deep.Joe takes the lead in finding the bad guys, discovering the web of relationships that binds them and determining the best manner to bring them to justice.The novel starts slowly as the various characters are introduced and the pieces are put in place; it then ends in a crescendo of violence as Joe's plan is put into operation.This is vintage Hannibal and vintage Dundee. Enjoy.

There are four episodes in this boxed set. The first is the pilot for the series. While not dark, it is far more serious than its successor. Set in a British prison, it provides something of a back story for the succeeding episodes. David Jason's character, Des, is doing a 3-year bounce. A stammering, perhaps brain-damaged individual, he operates the prison tea cart, shuffling through his rounds, hoping not to be subjected to insults and physical violence. So we think. Actually, he is something else entirely--a jewel thief planning a huge heist that requires him to give up three years of his freedom in return for something in the neighborhood of three million pounds worth of ice.In the second episode he is a free man, living large on the riviera, when he (and his son--who he met in prison) are called upon to steal a humongous rock on display in Buckingham Palace. The second episode is more caper than biography. It is wildly improbable but delicious fun. Jenny Agutter co-stars in the second episode as an Interpol officer who may or may not be on Des's side. Both episodes are amusing, though very different in kind, and Jason is, as always, superb. The next two episodes follow the pattern of the second: caper movies built on cleverness and fun. Think of 'Mission Impossible' involving genial thefts rather than espionage. We know at the outset that Des will succeed; we can't imagine how. Then we see the disguises and the use of special technology as the plot (involving sprightly dialogue) unfolds. They're all thoroughly enjoyable and relatively brief (a little over an hour) so that you always want more. Highly recommended.

This is a thoughtful and fascinating book on a very important subject: the construction of literary canons. While Guillory is not politically conservative (he shows some contempt for the explicitly conservative, like Secretary Bennett and criticizes harshly the putatively conservative arguments of a traditional liberal like E. D. Hirsch) he confronts some of the shibboleths of the academic left and politely shreds them. Literary canons are not formed by conservative, hegemonic white males to deny a voice to the culturally marginalized, for example. His alternative explanation, in brief, is this: canons require `evaluation'; the `site' of such evaluations is the `school'. The nature of the evaluation is based on the social functions and institutional aims of the school. Canonical texts are therefore those works that form the cultural capital distributed by the schools. Thus, works serve the school's social function of regulating access to these forms of capital.Since the top schools distribute the `top' cultural capital, differentiation between schools (private/public, academic/vocational, and so on) sustains the differentiations within society. The dominant have their schools (and their canons), the dominated theirs. He argues instead for a unitary curriculum (delicately following Gramsci). Without a unitary curriculum you get different curricula for different groups. This produces the same social stratification as different schools for different social classes.Thus, he admits that "it is no longer politically strategic to argue for the necessity of teaching certain `noncanonical' works solely on the grounds that these works represent social minorities." Instead, he argues, we should now consider women's studies, black studies, etc. `research programs' and not as special curricula for separate constituencies. Following that principle would, of course, result in the dissolution of such departments or separate units, since those with an interest in pursuing such a research program could do so within the departments that preceded the separate units. Indeed, it is already the case that individuals within a multiplicity of such departments (sometimes joint-appointed to the separate unit, sometimes not) already pursue active research programs in these various areas. Having separate curricula for `separate groups' (following Guillory and Gramsci) risks the dissemination of different levels of cultural capital and continuing the differentiation between minority cultures and dominant ones rather than moving beyond those differentiations.Despite the highly flammable subject matter, this is not an edict from the battlements. It is a very, very abstract arguing of the case and (unlike Hirsch's work, e.g.) it will be largely inaccessible to most readers below the graduate-seminar level. While Guillory's erudition is impressive and his range of reference extremely broad, the writing remains extremely abstract and theoretical. The points are argued in very dense prose and vivid examples to elucidate those points are few and far between. It is almost as if it gives pain to the author to descend to a less abstract level. While the book rewards the effort it is unfortunate that it could not have been written for a wider audience, given the importance of the subject and the acuity of the arguments.While the issues here are of immense importance to the literary humanities, the writing is far more philosophic than literary and a key source of inspiration for the author is the sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu. This is not, however, the sociology of the chart, graph, statistic and regression and there is more than a little theoryspeak. For the undaunted, this is a very important book.

Martin Clunes is, of course, a first-rate British comic actor. Here he plays a more serious character with a sufficient number of foibles to add comic dimensions to his actions. He plays an eminent surgeon who has suddenly developed an aversion to the sight of blood and redefined himself as a G.P. in a small, seaside village in Cornwall. This is a succession of fish out of water tales, with the amusement coming in equal measure from the doctor himself and the quirky locals. The doctor is well-meaning but occasionally feckless, dead-panned in his honesty and laconic in his speech (when, e.g., he is being interviewed by the local talk show host). This is the sort of thing that the British do expertly. The individual episodes are relatively brief, so that you can watch several in an evening or shoehorn one in when you don't have the time or inclination for a full-length feature. The Cornish setting and ocean views are a significant bonus and the stories are sweet, clever and suitably clinical. Highly recommended.

What you probably know: this is a film about a Japanese cellist whose orchestra is dissolved. He misreads a job ad and finds himself applying for a position as an assistant to a man who prepares bodies for their coffins (and, then, their cremation). The process is beautifully ritualistic, a very professional act of loving care. His wife is embarrassed by her husband's job and returns to her parents' home (waiting for her husband to find a new job). What happens, of course, is that the cellist discovers both the art and the humaneness of his new position and pursues it with the passion and skill that he brought to his cello playing. In the process he even has the opportunity to reconnect with the father who abandoned him. The film is sweet, heartfelt, amusing in a host of ways and very, very moving.What you probably don't know: the script is perfect, the acting pitch-perfect, the direction simply amazing. Film schools often teach direction using the grand-scale example of David Lean. Lean is a magnificent director, but for those making a smaller, more personal film with a limited budget this work of Takita's could serve as a new exemplar.This is the kind of film Hollywood seldom makes and more's the pity. It assumes that there are common elements in human nature; it addresses universal human emotions and it manages to be deadly serious in a lighthearted, touching, totally-apolitical way. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the filmmaker's craft at its highest level of skill. It is not a film that will change your life; it is one that will endlessly enrich it, by confirming the beauty, humor and pathos of human life and death.

Americans say "scream bloody murder"; Brits say "scream blue murder". In Blue Murder, Set 1 there is also some 'blue' content. The murder victim, we learn, has been making s/m blue movies. He is found, gutted, at his gardening allotment, feet in the shed, face, torso and legs in the dirt. The principal investigator, Janine Lewis, is played by Carolyn Quentin; many mystery fans will remember her as the sidekick in the Jonathan Creek series. She is now a single mom, having discovered her husband in flagrante, with three kids and a fourth on the way. The narrative cuts between her problems and responsibilities at home and her work at the south Manchester nick, where she serves as a DCI with a largely male team and an annoying, bean-counting, paper-pushing supervisor. This all sounds like Prime Suspect, but the atmosphere is more comic, even though the crimes are violent and real. The supervisor is a little too fussy; the problems at home are more annoying than insuperable and the Quentin character, with her weight, pregnancy and would-be love life, is a 'lighter' character than Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison.The supporting cast is strong, with the ensemble police team consisting of just the right mix of 'characters'. The mystery is plausible and interesting. The production values are solid. All in all, a very, very good series.
