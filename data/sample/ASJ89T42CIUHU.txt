I read Frances Mayes's book "Under the Tuscan Sun" before watching this film and gladly so. While the film took a different road than the book they both wound up smack dab in the middle of beautiful Tuscany each with its own brilliance.This film was adapted from an original memoir by writer/teacher Frances Mayes as she undertook the renovation of a Tuscan villa. The book is actually quite different than the story in the film but both are wonderful. Diane Lane stars as Frances and the story begins with divorce and the loss of love but it evolves into a sensual journey into Tuscany and ends with genuine love. Lane discovers herself while on a much needed vacation to Italy. She stumbles across a few signs that lead her to buy a beautiful, although run-down, Tuscan villa. This is where the real story begins filled with extraordinary shots of the beauty that can only be found in Tuscany and a brief examination of what makes life in Tuscany so amazing. Lane hires four workers, one Italian and three Polish, to renovate her treasured villa. Along the way walls fall down in clouds of billowing smoke, water boils where it shouldn't, thunder storms create havoc for humans and owls, olive trees begin to bear fruit, and relationships begin to form from a great supporting cast.This movie about a lost woman found is a true inspiration. Lane is excellent as the middle aged woman who loses her sense of self and discovers she never lost it after all. The movie is about life and love, beauty and new discoveries but mostly it is about family, that richness that gives us life, whether our own or one we pluck from available sources. The scenes are filled with the beauty of Italy, flowers in bloom, wine and food prepared with love and great effort is paid to the scenic views of such a rich country. Be prepared to look for signs of your own after watching this film, craving a table full of food with a family to sit down and enjoy it with and you may even find yourself booking the next flight to Tuscany for some villa shopping of your own under the glorious Tuscan sun of course.

This French film is one of the funniest movies ever, with great writing and a cast of huge talents.It all begins in a condom manufacturing plant with a boring accountant (Daniel Auteuil) who overhears from a bathroom stall that he will be fired from his position. Upon returning home he informs his ex-wife and son of his pending predicament and vows to find another job in order to keep them in alimony. He meets a new neighbor (Michel Aumont) who convinces him not to jump from his balcony and the fun soon begins. Together they concoct a story to save his job believing that if he can convince his company that he is really gay he will save his position by suggesting a prejudice exists. The company sends its dogs out to fend off any chance of a lawsuit and uses the services of its most macho employee (Gerard Depardieu) to "romance" away any perceived distaste for the new discovery. From here the story spins and weaves into a web of hilarious lies that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter.This film is so well written and easy to follow that the sub-titles are easily accepted by even the most English of all English speakers. While some of the references in this film might be taken harshly by those of the gay persuasion it is really only a lighthearted stab at all of the stereotypes that lurk within a corporate existence. Boring accountants could also take offense for that matter! Auteuil is fantastic as the bumbling lead, Depardieu is never better as the macho man who eventually finds his true passion, Aumont wonderful as the helpful neighbor with a few secrets of his own, the incomparable Jean Rochefort adds his own brand of humor to the film cast as the company CEO and the cast just continues into a complete brilliance.If you love to laugh, especially at yourself, this film will keep you in stitches and one viewing will leave you wanting more. For collectors of comedy films this one is a must have. So forget your hang-ups and enjoy a moment out of whatever closet suffocates you.

I have had this book on my bookshelf for years having picked it up simply because I loved the title and then finding out it is actually a classic literary epic.This novel is a heavy read, at times tedious and at times quirky, it is most definitely not a book to delve into while half asleep. Gabriel Garcia Marquez forces his readers to pay attention wrapping his fantasy tales around deep and abiding characters it is sometimes very difficult to interpret where the story ends and the fairy tale begins. I found Marquez's writing style very difficult to read without having a few notes scribbled about me to refer back to. He has so many characters in the book, some with the same name, and bounces back and forth between decades that if you are an unorganized reader by page 50 you will already be lost. I am amazed at Marquez's ability to sustain his own thoughts during the writing of this novel. I found the women to be far more interesting than the men, each woman a central figure in family life as well as the most entertaining fantasies. You will be confused, uplifted, humored, informed, saddened and satisfied when you reach the end of this unique novel.I enjoyed this novel but did not find it to be the life sustaining recommendation that so many others insist it to be. So many literary professionals and celebrities have pumped this novel up to such great expectation that I would almost dare to say I was disappointed that I missed the affect it was supposed to carry. I imagine if this novel was read several times and studied with a fine toothed comb it may produce such elation. But for the average person this classic novel is almost a chore although very much worth the effort.

This movie is impossible to watch with a straight face and without flinching. A true comedy in every sense of the word it will have you rolling in laughter and remembering your own experiences with the dreaded dodgeball.In a world of infomercials and faultless people resides the perfect man, White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Goodman owns and controls a state of the art health club and spends his life combing his feathered hair, pumping up and electrocuting himself over donut and pizza cravings. With a personality as shallow as his appearance he is a true specimen of gag reflex in motion! Across the street is a run down gym for "Average Joes" run by a hapless man of little ambition, Pete La Fleur (Vince Vaughn). Goodman and La Fleur soon begin a power struggle over ownership of his little gym and the games begin. SMACK! SPLAT! In order to come up with $50K to save the average joes from being eaten alive by White's arrogant conglomeration La Fleur and his gang of misfit members join a dodgeball tournament. With all seriousness the nerds begin to work out with a legend in the sport and after getting hit by iron wrenches and plenty of balls they end up in Las Vegas for the championship. Needless to say Mr. White and his robotic over-steroided team are also willing to be turned into pulp by a bunch of flying balls...Ouch!!Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are incredible in their roles as very serious gym owners and it is absolutely impossible not to laugh while watching this film. Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) does an excellent job as the girl both over jockulated men eventually vie for. Rip Torn is hilarious as the urine drinking dodgeball legend who eventually coaches greatness from his wheelchair. The gags and stabs at seekers of perfection are downright on the money with plenty of pumped up pecs and abs to fill an egotists dream. The average joes are all absolutely side-splitting with their uncoordinated efforts and messed up lives. The tournament is filled with subtle innuendos directed at everything funny about Japanese, German, Eastern European and Red Neck American athletes as well as that ever present superior being the Bodybuilder! Cameo appearances by Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff offer a few short moments of additional laughs. But the real hero of this film is the dodgeball itself, that red ball that has instilled so much fear in anyone who has ever faced it while hugging onto a wall cringing. I still can't figure out why watching people get hurt in innocent ways is so funny but I dare you to dodge the giggles that come from watching this movie each and every time someone gets smashed by a flying dodgeball!P.S.....Make sure you watch the credits for additional chuckles by Ben Stiller!!

Carson McCullers has written a beautiful book about the Depression Era with tragic yet deep rooted characters who pull at your heart strings.Every character in this book is written with compassion and understanding. They all possess a desire for something and they are all led away from exactly what they desire because of poverty, growth, transitions, death, prejudice and/or responsibilities. Your heart will hunt along with them all for that one moment that &quot;it&quot; all comes together. But like most lives the thing that we most want is often in the way of real life and one must make choices often leaving the dreams and desires of our heart behind.I liked this book because of the depth of the characters and the descriptiveness with which McCullers writes. However I felt it was a bit too long and didn't really wrap things up completely at the end. I would recommend the book purely for the message it contains....stay true to your dreams and stay hungry for life even if you are lonely, the best company is often in your own heart.

I picked up this book not realizing the impact it contained. Anita Pratap is a journalist who relentlessly pursues her stories throughout war torn areas. As a woman she is inspirational and as a fact finder a bull-dog who gets her story done. She writes with great impact telling horror stories but still managing to find a fleck of beauty that emerges in her own life from the experience.Pratap writes about dowry killings, Taliban rule and abuse, tribal wars and atrocites, class prejudices, poor people and abused children in areas like Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and India. These stories are courageous and bold and horribly real at the same time. Your heart will ache for the families that witness the horror of war killings and the pain of losing all that they own. This book will make you re-think your idea of sadness.

Steinbeck has managed to carry a biblical idea into the future, taking everyday characters and bringing them to life with ancient tradition while allowing his readers to see the commoness of man through both good and evil doings.Not only is this book biblical in theory but it is biblical in proportion as well at 600 pages it is a testament to Steinbeck that he was able to sustain his idea for such a lengthy saga. I read the book voraciously and finished it within two weeks, a first for someone conducting a busy life. I will be forever haunted by the impressive characters I came to know so intimately in the pages of "East of Eden". Steinbeck mastered the art of transferring biblical characters into believable modern life, Adam and Eve, Moses, Cain and Abel etc... Steinbeck convinced me that all people hold within themselves a choice between good and evil and he further instilled in me the fact that I have a choice (timshel) to embark on whatever journey my soul so wishes. I once believed that evil stemmed from abuse or neglect but I am better able to realize now that evil sometimes is just inborn. Steinbeck's words make you question your own choices and prepare you to some extent for the outcome of those choices. Although a choice may seem easy today its repercussions can destroy you tomorrow.I am amazed how this novel can actually apply to the modern day accusations about American life as well. I highlighted one paragraph and will refer to it often when I am finding that I have become spoiled by this American way of life, "Lee went on, `That's why I include myself. We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed-selected out by accident. And so we're overbrave and overfearful-we're kind and cruel as children. We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are impressed. We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic-and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture? That's what we are, Cal-all of us. You aren't very different" (Pg. 570). As I search for connection in the world, not just as an American, but also as a human this paragraph says it all. We are a wasteful, ambitious and free nation that tends to exaggerate our excess and ignore our contribution to other nations in this world out of habit and a sense of security. These luxuries are something we have a choice to share or misrepresent. I can only pray that the novel of our lives ends with as much compassion and insight as did Steinbeck's, "East of Eden".

I purchased this DVD based on all of the hype surrounding the movie and of course Russell Crowe acting in a period piece. After watching this movie I wish I would have saved the purchase for a box of popcorn and a matinee discount.Even Russell Crowe didn't pull in this movie for me despite being a great actor. He is convincing as Captain Aubrey but instead of acting and emoting he does more posing than anything else. Maybe it's because the movie itself had absolutely no storyline to connect the viewers to the individual characters. The sea is beautiful, the Galapagos adventure amazing, the period pieces and ship detail as accurate as I could imagine, but there just is no plot. Two boats travel about a restless ocean trying to anniliate one another over political control, so what! I even rooted for the French in the end because their Captain at least attempted to help an injured Brit while Russell Crowe was busy posing and demanding the loudness of cannons for interest. I was ready to de-board and take in a documentary on the Galapagos Islands, the only really interesting aspect of this film.

A great adult animation film!! Tim Burton has blended stop action animation into a world of fantasy that is worthy of watching again and again.Jack Skellington is a long lanky skeleton who exists to inspire a creepy town on Halloween but alas he begins to desire something more. In his explorations he discovers an opening into a Christmas town where life exists with lights, presents and gaiety. Because of the theory that the grass is always greener on the other side our sad Jack feels the need to possess Santa and bring him back to his own dark Halloweentown while Jack becomes the new Santa. The story is great and a darkly humorous slap in the face of our over commercialized Christmas holiday. Along with Jack a cast of interesting characters exist in Halloweentown: Dr. Finklestein (a silly duck like version of Frankenstein), Sally (a lightly sewn together lady who needs a lot of stitches), Mayor (a two faced fatso with constant anxiety), and many others just as entertaining.This film would not be complete had it not been for Danny Elfman's musical score. The background music is really beautiful along the lines of a fairy tale with twists of horror laced in between. The lyrics for the songs are brilliantly poetic in a Halloweentown type of way and you may even find yourself humming a few for days afterwards. This is a must see DVD for every Halloween to come and maybe even the following Christmas just to add some nightmares into the overly sappy day!

Recently I viewed the movie, &quot;The Hours&quot; starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. The movie is based on the book by Michael Cunningham and follows the book's ideas about as precisely as possible for a screenplay conversion.The story revolves around the author, Virginia Woolf, as she writes her story, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and how the words she writes affect two other women in different time periods. Virginia is portrayed by Nicole Kidman and she does a wonderful job showing the essence of Virginia's depression and self-doubt. A brilliant writer who involves all of your senses in her prose she succumbs to the artist's tendency to be self-doubters and insecure, possibly from all the exposure to critics at every bend and corner. The cigarettes she smokes seethe about her as she contemplates her suicide and a word to leave behind, like her soul is going up in smoke. She lies beside a dead bird and she feels dead before her time, unable to fly and stifled by depression that is never fully explained. Her end is filmed in such a way that she surrenders herself to the river's current and slowly gets swept away by nature but she seems somehow freed by her own death, floating along in time and crossing the borders that time presents.Julianne Moore plays the character, Laura Brown; a pregnant homemaker in the 1950's who is struggling with what life has to offer her. She seems to exist in a blur of emotion all of which sways towards depression. She attempts to bake a perfect cake for her &quot;perfect&quot; husband's birthday and fails sending herself into a moment of panic that almost produces her own demise. She runs away from her child and stays alone in a hotel ready to take her life and that of her unborn. She reads &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and becomes involved in another's misfortune which somehow awakens her to her senses and she retreats back to the normalcy of her mundane life. I could not help but be emotional during a scene where she is preparing herself for bed and her husband calls from the bedroom, &quot;Come to bed Laura Brown,&quot; it left me with a sickened feeling. In Laura's eyes you see her sadness and her desperate need to leave but she stays, unhappily, like a servant.Meryl Streep plays, Clarissa Vaughn, a modern woman who follows the footsteps of Virginia's character &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; as she spends her day catering to others. She buys flowers in desperate attempts to cheer up those around her when in fact she is the one who is in need of cheer. She tries to revive a dying man played brilliantly by Ed Harris, Richard, who is succumbing to the power of AIDS and all of its downfalls. Clarissa opens windows for brightness where all she sees is gray; she perks up the grayness with flowers but only manages to bring a feeling of hopelessness to Richard instead. His writing award seems to go unnoticed although she plans a tremendous celebration his soul just shuts down. Under all of the pressure Clarissa breaks down and experiences the sadness of the day and the reality of death. Richard falls from his own window in his desperate act of suicide and mercy. Clarissa is left to deal with all of the pain.In the end we learn that Richard is in fact the son of Laura Brown. Seemingly she has transferred her loneliness and despair to the life of her own son without regret. She explains that she abandoned her family after all, needing to conduct her life on her own terms.The music and the language of the film inspire creative juices, especially the scenes where Virginia Woolf is speaking. Having read the book first I was able to experience more than the film managed to contain although the film was more easily explained. I recommend both expressions for the full impact of these desperate women and the lives they lead. It will not take hours to be gripped by their needs.

This film is stunning. The real Aileen Wournos is alternately scary and sad. This documentary is openly revealing and will make you contemplate justice.Aileen Wournos has been labeled a serial killer because of the murders she committed on 7 men who sought her services as a prostitute in Florida. Her story is depicted in the movie, "Monster," and after watching this film I give more credit to Charlene Theron (the actress who portrayed Wournos) because Theron really got her mannerisms down. Beyond the glory of the Hollywood movie however is a life that spun out of control. Wournos was born as a breech birth, abused drugs, came from a broken home, was sexually promiscuous and was ostracized from her home at 13 after giving birth to a baby and giving it up for adoption. So what, a lot of people experience the same circumstances and manage not to commit murder, right? Well in my opinion this case is as complicated as it gets. In this film, director Nick Broomfield brings to a head all of these questions and allows the public to see the behind the scenes mind of a notorious "serial killer," and how she got that way.Wournos gives several interviews during 2002 to Broomfield and as the film progresses she changes. At first Wournos appears severely angry, completely devoid of manners and calculating. Her eyes are black and somehow eerie to peer into and her laugh is a wicked cackle. When she loses her temper she does look like a "monster" and is quiet scary. But as the time passes it becomes more than obvious that the woman is completely insane. Her story changes and her original plea of self-defense becomes cold-blooded murder and then she changes her tale back again. She suffers from paranoia and begins to think the police knowingly allowed her to murder in order to clean up abusive men from the streets of Florida. Wournos attempts to explain how the prison is rigged with sound waves in order to destroy her brain.....here is where I lost it. This woman suffered her entire life and while I do not agree with her resorting to murder to appease her own weary soul I do feel our justice system owed her better treatment. Should insanity be punished by death? I questioned my own thoughts on the death penalty for days after watching this film.Nick Broomfield did an excellent job on this stunning documentary, bringing up many necessary points regarding our justice system. For instance Wournos is given a psychiatric evaluation by 3 doctors a day before her execution and they only interviewed her for 15 minutes. Being a layperson and watching Wournos speak for 15 minutes I was able to see that she is totally and sadly insane, why didn't the real doctors? One of the more emotional moments of the film is when Broomfield tells Wournos that he spoke with her real mother. Wournos becomes eerily enraged and horribly violent but after watching the mother's interview it is plain to see Wournos is not the only person at fault in her life. Wournos made a statement before her death stating "I'll be back," and sadly I feel her spirit exists in many young lives that are left on the streets and forgotten, only to suffer from abuse and neglect because they cannot conform to "normal" society. Yes, murder is wrong but so is the abuse and torture that accompanies all those "innocent" sexual perverts who prey on our lost and lonely youths. Wournos was executed, she should have been institutionalized in a mental hospital and probably behind bars for life, but how many others will suffer her same fate? I hope we can all learn something from this important documentary.

This movie succeeds where other award winners fail.....it works for every moment of viewing pleasure. For once a movie emerges that is well written, well filmed and well acted with a little controversy thrown in like a punch for good measure.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) emerges from a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. She reeks of white trash but manages to perfume herself with an undying dream. Maggie wears her heart on her sleeve and exists on the edge of survival pushing towards something better. She pursues the sport of women's boxing with relentless fervor befriending gym-owner Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Together the misfits persuade Eddie's partner, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), to train Maggie professionally. Beneath all the punches there exists vulnerable lives and failing egos but through teamwork and Maggie's brawn the boxing ring encircles them with life lessons.Oscar winner Hilary Swank is incredible in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald. Swank takes the punches and leaves behind the glamour of less gritty roles with her choices paying off immensely. She is entirely believable as the down on her luck loner trying to overcome the stigma of a worthless family. She is America, rough and rugged but filled with a blind passion to succeed despite all the critics who loom at large beneath her dreams. Clint Eastwood captures the power of simplicity in both his acting and directing on this film. Each scene is as unglamorous as most mundane lives unfolding quietly to reveal the true essence of living, that daily grind that most of us forget to appreciate. But it's the grind that reveals our true character and without Eastwood's brilliant low-key style this film would have never emerged as a million dollar gem. As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is subdued on the surface yet boiling underneath only overflowing with emotions as necessary. And of course the ever fabulous Morgan Freeman excels in his role as a half-blind ex-boxer content to mop floors and wipe bloody noses for his remaining days. His narration guides us forward and offers comfort to this hopeful and sometimes tragic story of real life struggles.This film is simply beautiful. It will make your heart soar for the grittiness of an underdog while identifying with a questioning soul. It is about hard work, perseverance and latching onto a passionate dream that guides you forward relentlessly. But it's also about hard choices and devotion that will leave viewers questioning right and wrong when faced with the desires of someone you love. This film sucker punches you in the end and leaves you breathless for days. But ultimately it takes you inside the ring of a family of misfits and makes you feel like a true champion with your own dreams.

This book is a perfect solution for those writers in need of something to write about.Caroline Sharp wrote this book after not writing for a significant period of time. She was searching for inspiration and invented her own. With this book she gives suggestions for various exercises and writing techniques. The book is meant to be done one chapter after another growing as you progress but some of the chapters are tedious and actually stopped me from writing, like the chapter on outlines (you have to write something in order to have something to outline!). I have found that skipping around works better for me only because some days are less patient than others.For those of you serious writers looking for new techniques and new ideas this is a wonderful book to absorb. Sometimes the best ideas come from out of the blue and this book just gives you the blue a little bit faster.

If you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts, but for those of you who prefer a plot and something that makes at least a little sense....skip it.A sports camera crew sets out to find the most daring of extreme sports heroes so that it can film an action movie in the Alps. They recruit a couple of crazy snow-boarders, helicopter pilots willing to outrun avalanches and then they toss in a pretty and dainty Olympic skier for good measure and some eye candy. The entire film consists of the frilly skier competing with the fearless snow boarders for attention and film time. They get thrown out of helicopters at high altitude without any oxygen and wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze...funny how that happens in movies! The real amazing feat is how they ski downhill in front of a major avalanche and can still talk to one another...have you ever heard how loud an avalanche is? Thank goodness for those sub-atomic hearing aids!! Eventually European terrorists enter the picture and a few automatic weapons (something has to encourage those slow moving avalanches). Well you know how it goes.The action is great and if you like skiing some of the stunts are literally unbelievable but other than that I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone with half a brain because you will just be frustrated with all of the impossibilities and missed reasons for people to die. I only watched it because I was forced into it by a couch potato with a remote.

This movie will make you think. What exactly are &quot;rules of engagement&quot; in battle? Can rules even apply to conflict?Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson are both excellent as veteran Marine soldiers fighting the battle of their reputations. Incidents occur in Yemen that unfortunately result in civilian deaths. So who takes the blame? Soldiers. This film brings to light the willingness of civilian judgement against someone volunteering to fight for his country. I don't think a bunch of desk jockies should have that right considering they have never faced a loaded gun and a moment to make the decision of their lives. This film will make you think about your own judgement and about the information you receive.William Friedkin directs this film with an easy hand, allowing the actors to carry the movie rather than a bunch of guts and glory. Although it was released in 2000 the events are very much related to today. Consider the court marshalls currently taking place against our soldiers in Iraq. Who is to say what rules exist for a young man or woman prepared to die. We know scapegoats exist if only politicians would take their share of the blame. Is it even possible to have rules when some people are immune to following them? Soldiers aren't playing a game that can be replayed for fairness, if they were none of them would ever die would they?

I found this book enchanting. Mma Ramotswe is both likable and hilarious as the lead character running her own detective agency in Botswana. She encounters many interesting sorts and solves their mysteries along the way.Alexander McCall writes with an easy style that encourages his readers to read a little longer. His chapters could easily be a short story within themselves. I was so wrapped up in his book that I read it in two days and am currently on to the next in his series about Mma Ramotswe. I see a movie in the future!!

After reading Alexander McCall Smith's first book in this series &quot;The #1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; I felt I had to read the following books as well because they are so enjoyable.&quot;The Tears of the Giraffe&quot; reads almost like a fable allowing us to determine whether or not lying for good or bad reasons can be wrong. It is an interesting delimma. I absolutely enjoy the way that Smith writes his characers. Precious Ramotswe, her secretary/assistant Mma Makutsi and her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are immediately likable and often shyly funny in the way that they interact with one another. This book brings two orphan children into Mma Ramotswe's life and leaves a door open for the next installment.The ending of the book is left with a wonderful fable-like suggestion about baskets being woven from the tears of a giraffe because that is all they have to give us. We can all give something no matter how small or insignificant it may seem and Alexander McCall Smith has given us a true treasure here.

This is the fourth installment in the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series and once again Mr. Smith gives us a dose of African pleasure.Precious Ramotswe finds a cure for her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni's depression and they are back on track. Her assistant Mma Makutsi starts her own typing class for men and falls in love. We get to know the apprentist mechanics a bit better and meet a few more interesting characters in search of mystery solutions from the detective agency. A few scenes are laugh out loud funny. Another enjoyable and easy read from Alexander McCall Smith.I rated this book one star less than the others in this series because of the fact that I felt portions of this book were repeats of the prior ones. I wish that author's who write a series would just allow the books to stand on their own without feeling the need to explain over and over again who and what the characters are. If a reader picks up the fourth book in a series without reading the first three.....isn't that the readers problem. I would have prefered more character's searching for answers than answers to questions that were already provided.

As the third in the No. 1 Ladies Detective series, &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls,&quot; continues along the same line as the first two books.Precious Ramotswe finds herself involved in a case for a &quot;government&quot; man and spends most of the book away from those that she adores. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni leaves his repair shop for a stint at the orphange to cure his depression. Mma Ramotswe's assistant is promoted to Asst. Mgr of the repair shop and takes on a case for the detective agency that leads her to discover the truth about beauty. All wrapped up at the end another moral lesson is learned from these wonderful characters.Alexander McCall Smith remains true to his original character concepts and deepens the readers understanding as to what makes them tick. He tells us another fable with a good moral to live by and leads us onto the next in the series. These books are easy, fun reads that blend light mystery with good judgement and relate an excellent lesson. I am looking forward to the next journey of Mma Ramotswe and her gang.

I originally purchased this book for myself but found its true value as a family heirloom.This book is a guided journal for writing an autobiography of your life. It contains 201 questions that are thought provoking and valuable. There are three life sections: Early Years, Middle Years and Later Years so that the journal can be written at any point in your life.

If you love films about strong women and what they can accomplish throughout the generations this flick is for you.The great Gena Rowlands stars as a homeopathic healer whose strength and spirit runs her town and family ragged. She compassionately treats a town of people with herbs and treatments made from love while watching over her daughter and granddaughter like a hawk. The daughter is played by Mimi Rogers, her character is a flirty frilly woman always in search of love and not very interested in medicine. The granddaughter is played very well by Susan May Pratt and she is the family member who ends up following in her grandmother's footsteps. The relationship between the grandmother and granddaughter is truly touching and inspirational. The strength of all of the women is to be admired especially because the film takes place during the 40's and WWII when women were still expected to be mothers, housekeepers and cooks rather than professional independent women on their own.Rowlands steals this film away and will leave you wishing for a grandmother just like her. The beauty of this movie lies in the compassion and relationships in a family of women. I believe it will charm you into a new way of living.

This little film leaves behind a huge impact. It is a tale of addiction and failure that will make you think.The ever interesting Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a stuffy bank loan manager who succumbs to the addiction of gambling. He spends weekends in casinos, hides his problem from co-workers and his girlfriend and suffers at the hands of his own actions. Hoffman is absolutely great in this role! Minnie Driver plays Hoffman's enabling and stupid girlfriend who believes in the lies more than what is before her eyes. Driver looses her savings and her life along with Hoffman in the spiral of gambling addiction and despair.This is one of those films that seems absolutely uninteresting but is deeply embedded with messages for us all. Gambling isn't the only addiction capable of destroying a beautiful and successful life so the mistakes seen in this film can certainly apply elsewhere. Mahoney is simply whatever owns you.....beware!

F. Scott Fitzgerald accomplished exactly what he set out to do with this novel. He wrote a simple and beautiful tale about sustaining the American dream.Fitzgerald offers us Jay Gatsby the overly confident, charismatic portrait of excess who falls in love with something beyond his reach, Daisy Buchanan. It is a classic love gone wrong story that embodies itself on the theory that we always want what we cannot have. Once money is added to the calculation the pursuit becomes all the more desperate.This novel is a must read if only for its classic status. It is an easy summer day exploration into the mind of greed, lust and all that it leads to. Fitzgerald managed to write something simple minded with great prose and compassion. But while uncomplicated it is also written with terrific insight questioning the concept of greatness at its very core.

This film is phenomenal! The story is small and somewhat insignificant in the grand scheme of things but isn't that what life for most immigrant American's really is?The Sullivan's arrive in America illegally and find themselves living in a junkie infested tenement in New York. With the dreams of immigrants, having arrived from Ireland, they set up a home proudly and without questioning their circumstances. The apartment becomes a bohemian beauty and is filled with love between the Sullivans's despite the dire circumstances they face. The family struggles with finding jobs, maintaining pride and adapting to the openness of life in America. The two young girls who play the Sullivan daughters are absolutely adorable and seem to run through life filled with innocence and hope, something adults sorely lack most of the time. The girls befriend many of the "strangers" in their neighborhood and seem to adapt to all of the endless oddities that surround them. Their greatest friend comes in the form of an ailing artist, (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou), who looms over them with what soon becomes a lifelong affection. The intricacies of the relationships in this film are what make it extraordinary. All of the actors are perfectly casted and deserve attention for what they have accomplished, no one is over the top yet they have all earned stardom for their down-to-earth simplicity.If you are looking for a movie that is effortless but well-written with characters of great depth and meaning this film is for you. Many scenes are touching and will make you consider your own existence in America, possibly appreciating it a little more.

I watched this film recently while reading Bill Clinton's book, "My Life," and after watching another DVD, "The War Room," and I have to say it's hard to tell if this "story" is fiction or a factual summary of Clinton's original run for the Presidency.Regardless of the story behind the story this movie stands on its own as an excellent political film. John Travolta is fantastic (amazingly close to the real Clinton!) as Stanton the Southern candidate running for office. He leaves behind all hints of his normal sexiness and turns himself into a slick, conniving out of shape politican beant on winning his campaign. He pulls off this role with amazing ability as an actor, tearing up when necessary and showing anger without any brutality, he held it all in his eyes.Kathy Bates plays a crazy campaign manager who tries to keep Stanton out of the dog house one too many times. She is brilliant in this role as a tough lesiban who succumbs to the reality of politics. She rants, she raves and she delivers great ethical speeches as her character attempts to right all of Stanton's wrongs (which are amazingly similar to Clinton's!).I believe this film will open up a new level of awareness as to what actually occurs during a presidential campaign. An interesting film with a slow growing message and quite appropriate for political followers. I just wish Stanton/Clinton would finally show his TRUE colors!

A MUST READ....but not for the faint of heart. Another truth about humanity and the lessons we should learn.Elie Wiesel, a Nobel Prize winner and Holocaust survivor, captures the pure horror of his experiences in the death camps during the Nazi regime. While the book can easily be read in a day the impact will remain for a lifetime. History has taught us to be aware but unemotional about one of man-kind's greatest atrocities but in this little book Wiesel will stir your emotion into action again. With horrible descriptions of babies being tossed into fires and prisoners having to make life and death choices everyday in order to survive it will leave you wondering how we allowed this to happen and re-happen (Rwanda!).Wiesel writes simply but so profoundly that you will physically ache with emotion after reading this book. But the fact that Wiesel's words remain relevant is the true tragedy. As human beings we must stop the act of genocide as it continues to occur around the world today. Let this small beacon of awareness shed some light on the generations that are to come and may we find our way out of the dark before additional memoirs must be written.

This is worst movie I have ever seen but I have to admit that is also one of the funniest!The movie contains a bunch of pranks conducted by a group of &quot;Jackasses&quot; who will try just about anything as long as it inflicts pain or can kill them. It sounds absolutely stupid but I could not stop laughing and I consider myself a mature, educated and conservative adult. You will wince in pain, feel a few disgusted gurgles in your belly, and feel totally offended but you will still watch the antics of these crazy dudes!So sit back and remember those old days of insane fun just because you believe your young and invincible. Everyone has been a jackass at some point just be happy these dudes are doing it for everyone to see and not you!

Sometimes a romantic comedy comes along that pulls at so many strings and is appealing on so many levels that you have to watch it at least once or twice a year...this movie happens to be one of those special treats.Paris becomes her own character in this beautiful comedy filled with the romance of a great city all under the watch of the sparkling Eiffel. This movie is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and he works the film around beautiful scenic French views leaving viewer's that love Paris breathless and begging for more. The storyline is humorous and the actors perfectly cast in roles that they seem natural at playing. The film is effortless to watch and that must be why it draws me in year after year.Meg Ryan plays a woman engaged to Timothy Hutton in a boring and predictable little relationship. Things change drastically when Hutton goes to Paris on business and leaves Ryan at home because she is afraid to fly. But there is nothing like an old jealous heart to overcome such a silly phobia and Ryan finds herself on a plane to Paris to save her man from the arms of a beautiful young Parisian. Aboard the plane she meets Kevin Kline, who represents all things stereotypically French! Ryan is always perfect as the girl next door who stumbles about trying to stay in love. She is cute and perky as usual. Hutton is staid and serious until he is seduced by a vibrant and passionate French woman and begins his mid-life crisis falling for the belief that this seductress wants him and not his salary. Kline is convincingly French, with his wild haired and open minded talk, his always present dismissing pout and his passion for life. The fun begins as the plane lands in Paris and it never ends.If you love France this film will romance you many times over. The cast is great together and the romantic comedy great for the heart. From the most romantic city in the world Kasdan gives us a new reason to dance and a desire to kiss as the French do!

Finally a romantic comedy that is really both, funny and touching.Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher form an excellent comedy team in this movie, they feed off of each other perfectly and offer great moments of sarcastic fun. Murphy is a rich young woman who prefers to fall in love for love's sake rather than for a financial portfolio. Her parents, played by Veronica Cartwright and David Rasche, are hilarious as the controlling rich folks. Kutcher is the beach dude with little besides charm in his portfolio. Needless to say the two opposites fall in love, marry and begin a honeymoon in Europe. This is where the film becomes a real comedy, watching Kutcher bumbling around Europe with absolutely no class while Murphy tries to smooth all of his behavior over. It begins with the smallest rental car ever and ends with a whole mess of confusion in Italy. Believe me if you have ever been to Europe you can completely relate to the bumbling Americans!This film is really well done, visually beautiful, highly comedic and even touching between the moments of laughter. Murphy and Kutcher are perfectly cast and work together really well. And we must not forget the little bulldog that spends a few scenes hamming it up! With so many other romantic comedies on the market that don't work this one is a happy surprise and perfectly just in its cause.

It's about a catAnd his big striped hatHe meets a bratThe sister ratsAs pesky as a gnatThey want him to scatBut the house goes splatAnd that was thatSo much for the catAnd his silly hatFor anyone who loves Dr. Seuss this silly movie brings the book to life in full blown color and lots of action. Director Bo Welch has captured the essence of a perfect little cartoon town with great vibrant colors, lots of lime green, orange and pinks, and an entire world that looks unreal as something that only exists in the best of imaginations.The cast in this fun family film is wonderful with Mike Myers grabbing the spotlight as the infamous Cat in the Hat and he does a marvelous job in this role despite some repetition with his characters from the Austin Powers movies. Dakota Fanning is the perfect little child and nicely contrasts her hyper-active brother played by Spenser Breslin. Kelly Preston is the ideal cartoon mom with not a hair out of place despite all the chaos she encounters. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly funny in his role as the scheming neighbor bent on seducing the innocent mom next door. Sean Hayes (as Mr. Humberfloob) and Amy Hill (as Mrs. Kwan) offer additional hilarities in their small supporting roles. Overall this movie is a great bit of entertainment for young and old alike and something that can be watched over and over again with a little something new from that silly Cat in the Hat and all his goofy acts.

I began watching this film on a late night of insomnia....it didn't help me to sleep and that's a good thing!Isabelle Adjani artfully plays real life French sculpturess, Camille Claudel. She displays pure emotion and passionate reactions such that she is completely believable as the tragic yet talented Claudel. Claudel becomes Auguste Rodin's assistant and eventual lover/muse. They fight and compete for fame together and seperately with Claudel always the more talented but underscored by Rodin's jealously and fierce connections to the art world. In the end Claudel succumbs to a broken and ravaged heart betrayed in many ways by her one true love, Rodin.I recently returned from a trip to Paris and having seen first hand the sculptures created by Claudel and Rodin I am even more impressed with this tragic story of talented yet conflicted artists. To see the obvious gentleness with which Claudel can carve marble and to feel the warmth that stems from a slab of cold stone left me mesmerized by her talent. Rodin appears clumsy and inept next to her creations despite his world reknown fame. I will always wonder what a woman of her talent could have created had she been alive today and not under the influence of an egotistical maniac!

This modern classic novel is not an easy read but it hides a multitude of reasons to keep reading between its cumbersome lines.Mrs. Dalloway leaves her upper crust English home one bright morning to buy flowers for her party. In the day that opens up Mrs. Dalloway crosses paths and encounters old friends to the point that she spends her day in contemplation, something it appears she hasn't done for quite some time. Against the backdrop of a ticking Big Ben Clarissa Dalloway remembers her youth, her exuberance and her dislike for societies norms but interestingly finds herself to be all that she distasted as a vibrant young woman filled with a sense of freedom. In her world is the ever moody, Peter Walsh, a man who never quite left his love behind as he watched Clarissa walk away with Richard Dalloway so many years ago and Sally (her long lost best friend) who once contributed to Clarissa's immature whims. Unknowingly Septimus Warren Smith lurks behind the day in his war-torn madness and he becomes a factor in Mrs. Dalloway's delightful day.Virginia Woolf wrote this novel in 1925 many years prior to her own mental illness and suicide, but within the lines of this novel I sensed a tortured soul and a scattered but calculated mind at work. I admit I struggled with Woolf's writing style and never quite found a fit that felt right. She writes with such stops and starts that one must almost be a literary professor to keep up with her thoughts as they are strung out into extraordinarily long sentences laced with a multitude of punctuations. I found that I was often lost on what character she was delving into and had to go back and re-read entire paragraphs to figure out where I had lost her thought. She is certainly demanding of one's attention! Interestingly enough there are many references to water in this novel and I felt the beginnings of a connection between Woolf's characters and her own suicide method. Don't expect simplicity in Woolf she believed that her style of calculated impressionism would open up the art of the novel. Certainly in one day Mrs. Dalloway experiences what most people search a lifetime for and I found Woolf's explanation of aging quite moving, "But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves. There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now...."I recommend watching the film, "Mrs. Dalloway," with Vanessa Redgrave after reading this book once or twice because somehow bringing Woolf's characters to life gives them a less elite meaning and allows for a bit of commonness and intimacy. But to grasp the meaning wrapped in Woolf's prose this novel must be read over and over again. For so fragile a creature as Woolf ended up being she is by far one of the strongest writers to have graced this world and her work is something to spend hours pondering over.

Neil Simon is a master storyteller and has such an amazing way of creating complexity out of simple characters. I found this film to be one of his better stories.This movie is timeless and for anyone nostalgic for the 60's it is a walk down memory lane. The story is found in the relationship between two young people who marry and move into a Greenwich apartment. Both the apartment and the relationship need a bit of work and throughout the movie the characters strive for a better living arrangement.Robert Redford is a bit stiff in his role as the serious lawyer husband to Jane Fonda's perky and ever curious wife. Together they are a mismatch that somehow works or at least you hope it will. The scenes are deeply written with lots of twists and turns and comedic outlets to maintain the viewer's interest. The funniest parts of the story arrive during the scenes with Fonda's mother, Mildred Natwick, and their Hungarian neighbor, Charles Boyer. Opposites attract from all angles and Simon's writing brings all of the mismatches together with an interesting flair.If you love New York, Redford, Simon or Fonda or just a great old love story with a few laughs this film is for you. So kick off your shoes and enjoy this walk in the park!

This movie is a great modern western complete with strong women, evil men and a little girl that will steal your heart.Ron Howard directs this western set in New Mexico and molds a beautiful and well written film into a masterpiece. Cate Blanchett stars as a woman who practices the art of healing; she lives alone on a ranch with her two daughters and survives with a lot of strength and gusto. Blanchett receives a visitor one day, her long lost father, (played with excellence by Tommy Lee Jones) and the story begins to unravel and pick up steam. Then she sends her daughters off with workers to the city but soon finds they never return. She discovers the campsite and finds her youngest daughter (Jenna Boyd) amongst the ruins. The men have been killed and her oldest daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) kidnapped by Indians bent on selling her in Mexico. Most of the film is spent on the chase between good and evil throughout New Mexico and is both suspenseful and stunning.Tommy Lee Jones is fantastic as the father who abandoned his family and Blanchett in order to run with Indians. He is wise and spiritual and ends up being a leader at the very center of this film. Meeting Jones's greatness is Jenna Boyd, she plays the youngest daughter of Blanchett and is a true spitfire, her role makes you question if true strength is born or made. Evan Rachel Wood is alright in her role as the kidnapped daughter but her character's ineptness is highly irritating although she certainly adds to the suspense of the film. One of the most effective roles is played by the grotesque Eric Schweig, who manages to portray the evil Indian witch with great conviction; he makes your skin crawl! Although the story that unfolds around these characters is fairly basic it is a fabulous experience filled with courage and depth while diving into the heart of evil as well. If you love westerns this should be added to your list but this movie is also much more than just a western filled up by guns and horses, it is a story about family and the relationships that bind us through our greatest despair.

Another who-dun-it involving cops, serial killings and San Francisco with an interesting outcome surrounded by a typical cast of characters.Men are dying in San Francisco, washed up with beaten faces and cigarette burns. You would think a few good cops could figure yet another murder mystery out but this one has a few twists. A woman detective might be getting framed or is she at fault for sleeping around? An evil eyed partner acts a little too familiar with her surroundings. An unsolved mystery is covered up by a malicious police force and a surrogate father pushes a bit too hard. So who did it? Let the fog of San Francisco be your guide!Ashley Judd plays the same character she always plays, vulnerable, tough, on the verge of tears and at the center of yet another murder mystery. In this role she is offered a bit of an edge, an angry one that she tries to cover by sleeping around with men that she picks up at random at bars.....would a professional detective really be open to the danger in that? Her partner is played by Andy Garcia who just sort of blends into the scenery except for a few random moments spent on his suspicious eyes. Samuel L. Jackson is Judd's surrogate father, the man who raised her after his partner (her father) is killed on duty. With a few other male detectives making their presence on screen just to snidely comment on Judd's sexual habits the cast is complete and entirely typical. The only surprise comes at the end...as it should!If you enjoy movies that involve a mystery then this film may appeal to you. The story is fairly basic but the plot leads you into the twist at the end. It is interesting but not original and suffers because of the storyline.

&quot;Would You?&quot; is a book in the &quot;If&quot; series and it has 250 questions that will challenge you to discover how much character you, or anyone else, actually has. The questions are thought provoking and some almost impossible to answer. This little book will force you to THINK in ways that test your values and beliefs. It is a great conversation opener as well as something to spend a few hours in deep contemplation over. It would be a great idea for the next presidental debate!

The only thing good about this version of Tolstoy's classic story is that it represents the novel very well. Otherwise this miniseries is a waste of time and entirely aggravating to boot.Tolstoy's great character "Anna Karenina" is reduced to a porcelain skinned bubble head in this film. Anna as played by Nicola Pagett just doesn't do justice to the original character who is supposed to exemplify all things seductive and selfish and remain aloofly beautiful despite all her faults, Pagett comes across as falsely attractive and lacking in any seductive ability whatsoever. But she is forced to work with Stuart Wilson as Vronsky and he is even worse! Looking like a tenor from a barbershop quartet and acting almost as atrociously Wilson shames Tolstoy's character beyond words. Vronsky is an expert horseman but watching Wilson attempt to ride around Anna's carriage in one scene is almost comical, he could have used the glue on his fake mustache to hold himself in the saddle a bit better!Some of the actors in this series pulled off their parts well: Eric Porter as Karenin, Caroline Langrishe as Kitty, Robert Swann as Levin (minus the fake beard!) and a few others. The scenery is gaudy and paper-like with doors that shut and almost fall apart. The costumes are often beautiful, especially the ones worn by "Anna Karenina". The film itself is exactly like a daytime soap opera and tends to make the entire production quite cheap and unattractive. More effort should have been paid to this miniseries in all aspects in my opinion. Thankfully the storyline followed Tolstoy's almost to a tee so for anyone looking to place a dramatic interpretation on the classic novel it will be interesting to watch. But I have to say that at the end of 3 hours I was ready to see Anna's end so that I could put an end to my own suffering. Sadly the best part of the novel, Levin's search for faith, is not covered very well. It just goes to show that sometimes the imagination is better than any professional version and in this classic case I believe it to be magnified.

Kevin Costner has brought the simplicity of an old western movie into a new age and done a fantastic job, both as an actor and as director.The storyline for this film is a bit bland and basic but the intensity of acting and the scenery make up for the lack of substance in the story. &quot;Open Range&quot; takes you into a real western setting where one could see for miles and miles only what God made and be humbled by it. The gunfight is fantastic and so much more than any found in the good old western movies.Robert Duvall is perfect as Boss, an old grubby cowboy with heart. Opposite Duvall you would think Costner would pale in comparision but he fits in almost as perfectly as a man with a mystery past. Annette Bening is subtle in her role, as a doctor's sister, but no less important to the film as Costner and Duvall. But the most impressive character in this film is by far the western scenery and the reality of nature's wrath out in the open range of 1882.

Every little girl has wanted to become the incorrigibly adventurous Madeline as introduced by children's writer Ludwig Bemelman and this movie brings her to new life.Madeline (Hatty Jones) resides in a French orphanage, wears a little blue suit and cap and creates havoc wherever she goes. Help is only a step away with Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) at hand and she rescues little Madeline often and with good cheer. But the orphanage is scheduled to be sold by the owner Lord "Cucuface" Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and the girls who live with Madeline devise a plan to save their home. All sorts of antics take place against the backdrop of the beautiful Parisian scenery that surrounds the worried little orphans.Hatty Jones is really superb as the classically mischievous orphan in blue, Madeline. Hatty has the perfect button nose and red hair to pull off the look but she also manages to capture the impish thoughts of the little character as well. Frances McDormand is highly likable as the Sister who adores her home full of orphans. Nigel Hawthorne pulls off the uppity roll of a wealthy property owner who could care less about the future of a few bratty orphans. But it is the beautiful city of Paris that steals the show, with glimpses of perfection at every corner how could an orphan in Paris ever be sad. No wonder little Madeline has remained such a happy sight for generations of children and adults.

This is my favorite Melissa Manchester album and I still listen to it often because the music is timeless.Ms. Manchester recorded this album in 1975 and it was her third album to date. She wrote most of the songs in collaboration with such biggies as Carole Bayer Sager and David Wolfer. The songs are classic cuts that defy time and span decades.Upbeat cuts include: &quot;Just Too Many People,&quot; &quot;Stevie's Wonder,&quot; &quot;Love Havin' You Around,&quot; and &quot;It's Gonna Be Alright.&quot; But the best songs are the torch songs that feature Melissa's fantastic voice against a soft or jazzy background, such as: &quot;We've Got Time,&quot; &quot;This Lady's Not Home Today,&quot; &quot;Midnight Blue,&quot; &quot;I Got Eyes&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want To Hear It Anymore.&quot; This CD will take you from fireplace, to car seat, to beach, to romance but mostly it will serenade you for years to come.

In the past George Michael has had some truly wonderful CD's, inventive, daring, funky, inspirational, but this CD I am sad to say has fallen a little short.The best songs on this CD are "Amazing" (classic George, popish and fun with a grabbing beat), "Round Here" (jazzy and cool), "Shoot the Dog" (club mix that will make you get up and dance), "My Mother Had A Brother" (a nice slow anthem to Gay life), and "Flawless" (another runway model dance mix).Most of the remaining songs are far too slow or have haphazard musical arrangements. I miss the old George with his jazz and funk influences. This CD is likable but not a classic like "Faith" and it lacks the daring inventiveness of "Older". I hope George Michael tries again soon with a little more heart.

I have been sorely dissapointed by this latest CD from Janet Jackson. The songs are far from jamming and nothing really stirs me. She sings in some sort of whisper or purr throughout the entire CD attempting to still be sexy. Wasn't the flash enough to convince America everything still works. I would much prefer a grove with a dance number to match than a whimpering sigh about nothing. What is happening to the talent in this family? Don't waste your money on this one, sorry Miss Jackson!!

If you are interested in watching two films in one this is the film for you. Hollywood has butchered a significant moment in history and what could have been a powerful film.Somehow the writers of this movie must have been trying to convince us of the errors of war without letting the horror of the bombings in Pearl Harbor speak for itself. Instead they threw in a horribly sappy romance movie in the midst of such tragedy. While I have no doubt that many of the people involved in the real Pearl Harbor were in love and beautiful, I have my doubts on whether or not &quot;love&quot; was the first thing on their minds during the attack. I also have my doubts that one woman could fall in love with two men who are both drop dead gorgeous and extrodinarily brave at the same time. Reality proves time and again the impossibility of this sappy romantic notion. This portion of the film should have been written out and left for the &quot;Lifetime&quot; network to promote!Now for the good part.....this film will have you on your seatbones during the battle scenes. It will rile your patriotism and inspire you to learn more about the actual event in history. The special effects are decent although some of the harbor scenes are obviously fake. But the horror of thousands of sleeping men being awakened to war is tragic. To even begin to fathom being buried in a sinking ship is horrendous. I wish the movie would have pulled a bit more at our heartstrings by focusing on true stories of what these brave men endured to survive such an event rather than just the magnitude of the bombings. This is where movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; reign supreme and this one fails.I recommend this movie purely for its ability to inspire you to learn more about the actual attack. Because the truth is in the men who survived this event not in this film. Worth noting of course is how our &quot;intelligence&quot; failed to protect Pearl Harbor. Maybe we need to construct a new word for that which &quot;protects&quot; us!

This movie with three actors in a seedy hotel room seems useless and inane at first but if you hold out until the end it is well worth considering.Vince (Ethan Hawke) is found in a seedy hotel in Lansing whooping it up and slamming back a few cheap beers while clamoring about in his boxers. Soon an old friend Jon Salter (Robert Sean Leonard) appears and the story begins. These two "friends" discuss old high-school days, mistakes and regrets leaving the audience to wonder about their supposed friendship. An explanation arrives when Amy Randall (Uma Thurman) knocks on the door. Be careful what you wish for sometimes old memories are better left behind!Ethan Hawke is eerily great in this role as a crazy, drug induced loser looking for answers about a past he can't seem to leave behind. Robert Sean Leonard is the subdued maturity of this film with his character seemingly capable of leaving a secret long in the past until the error of his ways comes back to haunt him. Of course Uma Thurman is wickedly brilliant as the supposed victim who turns a new leaf and leaves a few surprises. As with most independent films the writing and direction is fantastic in this film but the budget is shot! Some scenes are filmed irritatingly like an amateur videographer with far too much movement for the eyes to bear but other than that it moves like a staged dramatic play. Be prepared for lots of twists and turns and the possibility of no real answers as you reach the end of the tape!

I almost didn't read this book simply because it is a bestseller but thankfully I overcame my prejudice and found it comforting me at a time of great need.Mitch Albom has written a sweet little adult fairy-tale that reads easily, leaves an impact and even graces you with a bit of fable type wisdom. The main character, Eddie, is an old carnival man living his life alone and feeling practically useless until the day he dies trying to save someone on a ride. We follow Eddie on a magical ride through the stages of death. As Eddie goes through the death process he also reviews his life and discovers that several people he encountered in his life changed his life significantly. Some of these people were merely strangers and some loved ones, but they are all sent to meet him in his after-life process. Each small story is powerful and imaginative.Little did I know how much of an impact this little book would have on me but I read it only a few short weeks before my own mother passed away. Enduring such an experience is difficult at best but I credit Mitch Albom and this little fable as a huge comfort during a time of great need. I imagine the five people my mother must be talking to right now and I smile. Imagine the lessons we will learn if even a smidgen of this book's message turns out to be true!

I saw the movie made from this book first and I thought nothing could top the beauty of the film. I was wrong, as usual the book is always better than the movie.Alan Paton writes with extrodinary beauty making each sentence into a poetic phrase worth a second glance. He has written a story about racism, prejudice and forgiveness, ideas not often mentioned or acted together. Paton draws his reader into the beauty and magnificence of South Africa without the benefit of pictures, but your mind fills with splendor anyway. The lesson Paton provides is beautiful, to accept others, to betray society's prejudices and to die with a clean and pure heart.

Elie Wiesel has written a profound sermon on the holocaust worth the world's contemplation."Night" is written as a novel but I have learned it contains many actual events that Wiesel witnessed as a prisoner in camps Birkenau, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald during WWII. It is vivid and stabbing in its horrible descriptions about the concentration camps. Wiesel writes about babies burning in pits, sons burning their own fathers in cremation ovens and all of the complex choices that the victims of the Holocaust faced. This book is well written, great style, penetrating descriptives and straight to the point. It is definitely not a wasted afternoon spent reading this little book with such a huge impact.I am surprised this book is not required reading in every school. With so much racial profiling still evident in the world we could all benefit from a dose of wisdom written by a man who knows first-hand the outcome of pure hatred. "Night" will shed a great light on even your darkest day.

If you like evil kid movies this one may appeal to your senses but if you are looking for something that induces nightmares this film falls far short.This movie is basic at best and the storyline is entirely predictable. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos does a good job playing the over-protective and freaked out mother of the evil child, played unconvincingly by Cameron Bright. Completing the perfect family is Greg Kinnear who is the ever suspicious father in this modern nuclear family on the verge of destruction. Both parents spend the entire film speculating on what is happening to the child they created with a mad scientist, played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro. After losing their real son Stamos and Kinnear encounter DeNiro at their child's funeral and seem to happily go along with an illegal fertility procedure to clone the dead child. The story just seems very far fetched to me. First of all if a doctor is doing illegal procedures why is he stalking every funeral in town searching for candidates, isn't that a little too risky? Also why would parents who find themselves confronted with their child holding an axe just accept him as one of their own as soon as he says, "It's me Daddy!" Maybe this film is best left unquestioned.The best part of this DVD is the alternative endings with five or six different outcomes some are actually better than the ending of the film itself. But the scariest part of this movie is the sound! Most of the film is spent with the characters whispering their lines so that you find yourself turning up the volume only to have every picture on your wall vibrating when the so-called scary parts need added effect, the sound is much more terrifying than the scene. I was hoping for more of a psychological thriller with emphasis placed on the rights and wrongs of cloning human beings instead this film just warns you about making rash decisions after a funeral. Maybe we should just leave the decisions up to God and make another choice in a movie.

This movie is both suspenseful and riveting with the incomparable Al Pacino in one of his best roles.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a young, talented lawyer looking for his big break. But when it happens is it too good to be true? Whisked away to New York Lomax and his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) leave behind the slowness of the South and find all of their dreams coming true, a big apartment, lucrative career and all of their needs taken care of. But by whom? John Milton (Al Pacino) runs NY's greatest law firm and convinces Lomax of a bright future under his wing.....but a fire lies in wait.Al Pacino plays a great devil! Keanu Reeves plays the same character he always plays...does he know how to act? Somehow his ineptness works for this role however as the naive Bible belt boy who encounters the big city with all of its lies and corruptions. Playing the conscience of the movie is the brilliant and beautiful Charlize Theron. Theron's role is the most well rounded as her character melts from the fire. But its Pacino's creepy intensity that both shocks and draws the viewer in, just like Satan! The plot, writing and scenery are fabulous with a few unexpected moments at the end to throw a spin on the whole beginning.

This film lacks just about everything except great actors. It is worth seeing, maybe once at best.Anna (Julia Roberts) is a married photographer who meets her husband, Larry (Clive Owen) through a twist of fate porno site set up. She crosses paths with a writer, Dan (Jude Law) when she photographs him for his book cover but Dan is somehow involved with a young stripper/waitress (Natalie Portman). Inevitably when lies are told lives are fowled up and these characters really make a mess of things.With a great director like Mike Nichols at the helm of this movie one would think it would all work. However I felt it lacked depth of any kind. The characters are cruel and passionless despite being obsessed with sex 24 hours a day. Clive Owen is downright creepy in his role as a doctor who frequents porn sites for a thrill.....is he such a crappy doctor that he has that much time to kill? Julia Robert's character is more like his possession than a wife and her role seems to have no purpose whatsoever. It is never explained why a seemingly beautiful and successful woman would agree to marry a freak who believes he met her in a porno site chat room....any self-respecting woman would question that even if he were a doctor with a Mercedes! So there is definitely something deeper in there but it is never made clear and soon becomes absolutely frustrating. Jude Law's role is jealous and obsessive and would have made sense had he treated Portman's character with a bit more respect. And finally Portman is a bit over her naive head here pretending to be raw and racy while projecting far too much fear, she is a great actor but this role took something away from her.I'm not sure exactly where this film really fails, the writing, the directing or the subject matter. I think it would have worked had more attention been paid to the reasoning behind the flawed characters and their decision making processes. They should have stayed closer to a good psychiatrist couch rather than their bedrooms if you ask me. This movie is so far from close it isn't even near!

I read this book prior to watching the movie version and it prepared me for a gruesome ride.While the writing is basic at best, the horror and mystery is spellbinding. Hannibal Lecter will send chills up your spine for days and many nights! But amazingly he grows on you as a sickeningly likable character. Clarice Starling, the tough yet fragile FBI agent, pursues a murderer and with the help of Hannibal Lecter faces her true fears. Somehow they develop a relationship that makes sense....But how does madness make sense? That must be Thomas Harris's secret!

So I followed the hype and finally indulged myself....but I have to say I was lost period, even a translation dictionary wouldn't help me understand what people find so great about this movie.Bill Murray plays an old fart going through a mid-life crisis in Japan. So of course he is lonely and lost, big surprise! Scarlett Johansson is the young pretty thing living in Japan with her new husband who happens to be too busy to pay her much attention. So she is bored and lonely. Gee, I wonder what happens?I was bored watching this movie it felt a little too close to a day spent pacing the floor for something to do. Two people floundering around in Japan exposing themselves to situations that mean absolutely nothing. A great love story? NO! A surprise? NO! How many times do bad relationships start out exactly like the two characters in this movie? ALWAYS! The better message would be found in part two.....where the two lost people discover how stupid they were in the first place. But how many times have we seen a couple of bored people give up their lives for that moment of false recoginition...too many!

I love Frankenstein movies but this story is absolutely horrible, choosing to blend classic horror with really cheap Sci-Fi.Yet another time transportation film gone wrong, we find a future scientist (played by John Hurt) and his silver "Knight Rider" intelligent car sucked through a worm hole back into Mary Shelley's era. No one seems at all horrified by an over the top automobile speeding around the pristine Swiss countryside but as usual the Frankenstein monster is causing quite a stir. Raul Julia is Dr. Frankenstein and completely overacts most of the time that he appears in this film. Bridget Fonda (complete with fake English accent) is the beautiful writer to be, Mary Shelly. In this film Shelley falls for the future by taking a joy ride with Hurt in the "car" without the slightest blink of an eye. Intermingled in the cast are the characters of Lord Byron and Percy Shelley but they don't really have much to do with the story other than their relationship with Mary Shelley.The actual Frankenstein creature in this movie is angry, intelligent and made up to look more like a "Hellraiser" reject or someone who went to a really bad plastic surgeon rather than Dr. Frankenstein! The monster has lost all of the innocence and fear that the original creature had and thus the entire reason for liking him in the first place. The monster kills the good Doctor's fianc&eacute; and has a "woman" created for himself, but here we find the worst acting ever as the "woman" comes to life through the longest fake orgasm I have ever witnessed on film! Really bad!! I am surprised they were ever able to shoot this scene in seriousness I suppose it is the only saving grace in hiring great actors to shoot a bad film. The laser frying scene at the end is just pure stupidity and should have been left for an 80's disco movie. In this film you love to see the monster fried, he has no redeeming value. In my opinion this film should have been bound up and never released!

The writer of this film should have received an Academy Award alongside of Spielberg, it is nothing short of EXCELLENT!For the rest of my life I will watch this film along with the real D-Day documentaries on June 6th. The men who fought this war were true heroes and forever will be. I think every generation should pay tribute to the soldiers today and tommorrow who die willingly for our freedom. Spielberg has accomplished something with this film that touches upon both American pride and on the humanness of war. The scenes on the Normandy beach will reach in and grab ahold of your heart; torturing you beyond belief. But then pride will well up inside that same heart and your entire being will cheer as the first soldiers scale the hill. The movie just continues from there with scene after scene of triumph and terror with a storyline that will match the action in intensity, something rarely found these days.I hope you will watch and say a prayer for all those souls who fought so bravely for American freedom. Remember those who fight today and hope that it isn't in vain. Spielberg is a master director who believes in the truth and shoots his movies with conviction. I only wish politicians were of the same caliber.

This little book is brilliant, not only in its message but also in how it is presented. Andy Andrews combines history with inspiration and succeeds!The story is fairly simple: a man, dissatisfied with his life, finds himself in an accident and unconscious. During this period of immobility the dissatisfied man meets several people from history who relate the laws of success in various forms. The first rule of success is "The Buck Stops Here" (Harry Truman), second "I Will Seek Wisdom" (King Solomon), third "I Am A Person of Action" (Colonel Chamberlain, Civil War Hero), fourth "I Have A Decided Heart" (Christopher Columbus), Fifth "Today I Will Choose To Be Happy" (Anne Frank), sixth "I Will Greet This Day With A Forgiving Spirit" (Abraham Lincoln) and seventh "I Will Persist Without Exception" (Archangel Gabriel).The concept behind this book is unique and highly evolved. Andy Andrews has accomplished something here and after reading this book you may as well. Imagine the impact on one's life if we all had an opportunity to learn from the historical masters our life lessons. While such an experience will never happen in our actual lifetimes it is never too late to pick up a book and learn something new each and everyday. This is one of those books and it even includes a bibliography for further advice from those wise old owls not quite forgotten in the shuffle by a few who care.

What a tremendous impact this film contains! Not only are we witness to the horrors of pure hatred taken to the extreme but we are faced to contrast obscurity with the beauty of music.This true story of Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, will make you appreciate life and question your own character faced with having to survive such brutal circumstances. Imagine losing your home, your family, your friends, your dignity and then being faced with confronting death, not just as a situation, but as a horrible daily darkness that appears never ending. Left alone in a world destroyed as you know it, to fend for yourself by eating garbage and by checking the pockets of the rotting dead who surround you, would you, could you survive? Well Mr. Szpilman did and this film is a tribute to a true war hero. Although he may not be fighting with machine guns and grenades and he may not be actively filled with pompous arrogance, this war movie exposes Szpilman's character as a most worthy human being who sat in the pits of hell and came out on the other side a man capable of beautiful symphonic music.Polanski does an excellent job as director on this film by capturing subtle nuances alongside of the absolute horror to create a deep emotion within his viewers. He chooses to cloak this film in the colors of despair, grays, dirty beiges, all muted in tone and begging for light and brightness. We are only allowed to see the greenest of grasses towards the film's end. Many scenes in other movies have captured the horror of the cattle scenes, in which thousands of Jewish people are rounded up into freight cars and carried away to their ultimate deaths, but Polanski films a scene that ripped me to pieces just by the jarring sound of a metal lock closing on a freight car filled with life. Polanski also manages to convey the humiliation suffered by the Jewish people and not just how their lives were destroyed but also their dignity. He stays true to the humanness of his characters and in doing so never loses their impact throughout the entire film.What can we say about Adrien Brody? Simply that he is stunning! Brody becomes Szpilman and he personifies the walking dead. His entire being changes throughout this film, at first classy and dignified he transforms into a fragile beaten man who manages to feel a simple spark of recognition for life that keeps him moving. My heart ached with every step this tortured man took and cheered beside his undying ability to survive. Brody's walk becomes staggered and painful, his broad shoulders begin to stoop with burden, his mouth twists with scurvy and disease and his eyes reside in tragedy only to find some brightness with each chance survived. His hands become the instrument that seals his fate, sometimes elegant and well groomed and sometimes weak representations of their true abilities across a few dusty piano keys.This movie is a must have. It will stay with you for days and hopefully for an entire lifetime. We can only pray this devastating reality never touches our shores but as life goes hate somehow manages to exist. I hope that when faced with a moment of boredom, a pang of hunger or that furious glimpse of anger we can all remember this heroic story about Mr. Szpilman and that we allow it to change us into better representations of the human race. The truth is told in this movie and it must be respected and learned from because stemming from the bowels of hate the most beautiful music can arise if we strive to find it.

I bought this book because I thought the title was interesting. After reading it it all made perfect sense.&quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; is a unique story about a man who attempts to solve the mystery of his wife's death through the knowledge of his dog. Although the story is far-fetched it is appealing simply for the originality behind the plot. But the story is also sometimes too predicitable as well. How a linguist professor happens to own a dog who is smart enough to be the first talking dog....life isn't that easy. The dog story is entertaining if you like dogs and it sure will make you look at your dog a bit differently at the same time. I didn't like the animal abuse but I suppose if there ever was a real talking dog and scientists got ahold of it, &quot;real&quot; dogs would probably no longer exist. So not only do the dogs &quot;babble&quot; they also represent the story of Babel by attempting to cross communication gaps between species, in the Bible it was between tribes.So curl up with your favorite pooch and start your own babble for what it's worth. A nice read and something different for a change.

This essay taken from a lecture that Virginia Woolf gave to students in England during 1928 is an essential reading for writers and feminists alike.During the 1920's women writing literature were still struggling for a voice without prejudice. Virginia Woolf emerged as one of the first feminist voices ready to speak out against the silenced history of women writers and historians. In this book she argues that any woman serious about writing must have 500 pounds per year and a room of her own in which to capture a few moments of silence and restore her voice back to power without the pull of all her "womanly" responsibilities. Woolf seems to believe that one of the only true literary voices, one that wrote without anger, fear, or prejudice was Shakespeare and that his works have lasted because of the extension of this idea. Woolf discusses Br&ouml;nte and leans towards a woman writing with anger the seeps forth in her words and of Austen she expresses appreciation for what she must have endured in order to publish her works in a male dominated industry. Woolf clearly criticizes writer's that allow their gripes to appear in their works rather than their true talents. She appears hopeful that the future holds another Shakespeare and that inevitably it will be a woman who writes so extraordinarily this time around.Woolf shows herself to be one of the first true feminists our society had during her lifetime. She unabashedly criticizes a society dominated and silenced by men who felt it their duty to protect women from their own fear. Her critique of professors who openly claim women to be inferior is turned towards them as men concerned instead with being superior. She insists that the enlargement of men like Napoleon and Mussolini as well as the many wars society has experienced is purely because the light that is contained within women has been allowed to be dimmed by male domination. Woolf is saddened and disgusted by the fact that history and literature represented women so poorly in the past refusing to offer a woman as being anything more than a lover to a greater man. She also indicates that the suffrage movement probably contributed towards males feeling challenged by something far inferior to their inflated superiority. Her words are quite strong for a woman of her era but also fairly futuristic in thought.Woolf writes of many intelligent guidelines for any writer in this book. She offers a suggestion that one should write with an androgynous mind allowing both the softness of the feminine and the power of the masculine to come forth in words. A writer must not fear another's opinion but instead believe so forcefully in one's words that criticism cannot cause dishonesty of talent. And of course she is resolute in the fact that a writer needs a room of one's own to come to his or her center and in order to bring forth greatness without prejudice.

This French film is a charming tale of a boy coming of age during the 1960's while living in Paris.The story takes place on a busy little "blue" street in Paris during the 60's. A Jewish boy looks out his window each day awaiting his father's return from work and he sees the hustle and bustle of his neighborhood street come alive before his young eyes. He is on the verge of growing up and is fascinated by the street women and what they offer. Along the way he befriends an "Arab," the man who runs the corner grocery from Monday-Sunday. Together these two souls create a world as one, forgetting their age differences, religious differences and their placement in society. It is a lovely tale of growing up and finding true inspiration without the influence of anything but the heart.Omar Sharif is marvelous as the older Arab man, he is allowed to look older and scruffy rather than all dolled up in this quiet role. His smile is ever present and he portrays his role with great character. Playing the young man is Pierre Boulanger; a brilliant young French actor who I predict is going places. Boulanger is the perfect blend of innocence and youthful desire, handsome enough to be attractive as a man but boyish enough to still be naively curious. Together these actors form a wonderful team of youth and wisdom beyond what is captured on the screen.This film is relevant for today showing the perfect blend that can be found within cultural, religious and age differences when two people accept one another without prejudice. The message is clear, we are really one. This movie may be on the simple side but the idea is as complicated as growing up. With Paris as the backdrop of this striking tale it is impossible to fall short in the point it delivers.

This is a guided journal with writing prompts to get out all of the really important matters in your life. There is alot of writing space which can be looked as good or bad depending on personal preference. I would have preferred a little less space and more prompts. This journal is simple and easy to get through and at times more than just a book with blank lines running through its spaces.

When suffering from grief who better to place your heart with than C.S. Lewis, the master at heartfelt emotions and faith.C.S. Lewis wrote this little book during the process of grieving for his beloved wife, Joy. He brings his raw emotions forward and shares the act of grief in a very human and profound message. Showing a variety of emotions he spans the process of mourning and makes the act appear "normal" even when the slightest steps of self-care become a chore. Lewis braves the unthinkable and questions a God that allows despair and refuses to comfort the one left behind. Few would voice this common feeling but Lewis goes beyond simply voicing his doubt and eventually unravels the mystery of faith during the most horrible of times. Jesus Christ even experienced this desolate feeling crying out to God as he hung dying on the cross....so if He must go through such a bitter process why would the average human being expect any different? Realizing this places a perspective on the pain and allows us to stop questioning whether death and loss arrives in a package entirely explainable. It happens at exactly the right time for the one who passes and we must learn to accept this despite our lack of understanding. As Lewis writes so eloquently, "Fate (or whatever it is) delights to produce a great capacity and then frustrate it."Lewis takes standard thought processes and analyzes the theories behind their meaning and by doing so he helps the grieving process immensely. Hearing how our beloveds are with God causes one to ask, were they not "with God" before they died? And all those prayers said at bedsides and funerals, some with "miracles" attached and others seemingly lost actions are examined by Lewis as a process of torment by God, at once gracious only to prepare another torture in the end. Lewis reveals his anger towards God in hopes of leading to a deeper understanding of what faith really means. Grief becomes an act of desperation according to Lewis and seeing through tears often leads to blurred vision. Grief is merely fear incarnated. Ultimately it is through the observance of the dying that we discover the definitive peace and eventually find solace in faith.

Early feminism begins to emerge in this essay written by Virginia Woolf in 1938 as a follow up to her wonderful book "A Room of One's Own."Woolf received requests for three guineas from a women's college, from a society for promoting professional women and finally from a group requesting the prevention of war. This essay is Woolf's answer to those requests. While it is extraordinarily cumbersome to read the bottom line suggests that a society which promotes only one aspect of itself and suffocates anything else will never be advanced enough to protect its own culture and intellect from revolutions and wars. And because the idea of fighting rests in the very aspect so highly promoted (male dominated society) all of the laws and practices contain this strife and will until other parts of society are allowed a fair voice. The interesting concept is how little society has advanced from this original idea and the strife continues to be a factor today. Woolf suggests war exists as a profession and an act that offers "happiness and excitement" for the very society it falls under. In fact she goes as far to suggest that men would deteriorate without the outlet of war to contend with. Woolf discusses patriotism as a purely male act because of the fact that women simply cannot be patriots in a culture that suffocates their voices and refuses to educate them (remember this is 1938). The disturbing thought is that women are now able to vote, work and fight in wars but our culture remains basically the same with white males in domination. How slow we are to advance!Virginia Woolf believed that war could only be prevented through an educational system that stopped the glamorization of it and instead taught the inhumanity of the act. She found that poor educational systems actually taught better because they allowed art and creative processes to flow rather than the pomp and circumstance of wealth and the art of dominating, killing and capital acquirements. Sadly one of Woolf's most profound ideas applies today, "There we have an embryo the creature, Dictator as we call him when he is Italian or German, who believes that he has the right, whether given by God, Nature, sex or race is immaterial, to dictate to other human beings how they shall live; what they shall do." From a society of slavery, racism and suffering emerges a great savior promoting freedom? It seems an oxymoron does it not? Woolf continues, "And what right have we, Sir, to trumpet our ideas of freedom and justice to other countries when we can shake out from our most respectable newspapers any day of the week eggs like these?" The futurism of Woolf is astounding in this book as she finally suggests that women be labeled "outside" society so that her country is the entire world and her patriotism allowed to be the same. In a visionary profoundness Woolf manages to find an answer towards true freedom outside of the fascination of a few guineas.

&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was my favorite book as a child, this movie remains a favorite of mine even to this day.This film was made back in 1971 and is very simple in its style. The special effects are see-through and campy but the story line is a facinating metaphor for life that is forever timeless in its message. Willy Wonka is the creative genius who becomes a recluse in his chocolate factory because of society and its greed and malice. But he never loses his belief that someone in the world exists who can still believe in imagination and dreams. He finds this person in Charlie, a poor child who lives with his mother and four grandparents in a dirty basement home. Charlie has every reason to become dispirited and negative yet he remains a shining light of great positivity regardless of his circumstances. I suspect his attitude comes from the fact that his Grandfather Joe always supports his dreams, the boy never has to hear the word &quot;can't&quot;!The chocolate factory holds a contest and several children, including Charlie, get invited behind the doors with Willy Wonka. While on tour they are tested with fame, fortune, greed and honesty until one by one they succumb to the failure of a human heart. All except Charlie, who keeps a smile on his face and wonder in his eyes while being faced with the simple adversities that cause the other children to fail. Sadly I feel the parents are to blame creating children who thrive on material wealth, constant TV watching, gorging on food, and looking for constant attention. The parents of the children who fail refuse to believe in the dream of Willy Wonka surrounding the atomsphere with doubt and negative beliefs. How could anyone survive under such circumstances?The Chocolate Factory is filled with wonder, color and silly songs. Regardless of your age it will satisfy your sweet tooth and fill even a hardened heart. It certainly brings to life how parent's affect their children with their own actions and attitudes. Telling a child they &quot;can't&quot; accomplish all that they imagine only assists in stopping the world from greatness. Don't be afraid to dream!

This movie is almost impossible to explain but imaginative director Tim Burton has taken parts of Frankenstein mixed it with Desperate Housewives and added a bit of Beauty & the Beast eventually arriving at a hauntingly touching tale that is perfect for any audience.In a perfect sherbet colored community of track homes and manicured lawns there exists a woman named Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest). Peg is the local Avon lady and after running out of customers one bright spring day she decides to venture up to an old Gothic castle in hopes of finding new buyers for her cosmetics. Here she encounters a young man of a different sort all alone and begging to be taken home, meet Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp). Edward has been manufactured from the mind of a mad scientist (Vincent Price) and sadly has a bunch of scissors for fingers so he has spent life injuring himself and others, or so he thinks. Peg brings Edward home to her little 1960's suburban existence and as a curiosity factor he is immediately interesting to the housewives all vying for attention forcing poor Edward to indulge in all of their fantasies. During this time Edward starts to make topiaries and finds a talent for cutting hair, both for women and neighborhood dogs. He also falls innocently in love with Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). And so it goes until Edward is no longer useful to all of the hopeless housewives and falls short of his novelty existence in suburbia.The mind of Tim Burton is unlike any other and this film exposes all of the cruelties of society and the emphasis it places on perfection. With brilliant insight from an extremely unique perspective Burton brings forth the character of Edward Scissorhands from somewhere unfathomable yet he makes him entirely relatable if you have ever felt yourself to be an outsider. Johnny Depp brings Edward to life with a vulnerable innocence that can only be compared to the greatest movie creation of all, Frankenstein's monster. Winona Ryder is the beauty to Depp's beast. And of course the desperate housewives all have their own terrific roles here too with standouts like Dianne Wiest and Kathy Baker. Another character that cannot be forgotten is of course the great horror movie king Vincent Price who has a small but quite important role here. The music of Tom Jones and Danny Elfman contributes a haunting and humorous quality to life in this creative journey. But Tim Burton deserves the real accolades for no one other than Burton could have conjured up such a distinct fairytale like world and taught such an ingenious lesson at the same time for in a world where acceptance is so entirely materialistic and the mere mention of an imperfection a complete disaster, Burton offers the possibility of something more.

"Love Actually" is the perfect feel good movie for anyone who has ever felt the innocence and pitter-patter of butterflies in your stomach as you fall in love.This British film starts out a little shaky until you get involved with the stories behind all of the eight couples who will weave their way into the hardest of hearts. The movie contains many well known actors like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth as well as a few cameos. It is well written and somehow all of the interesting characters end up just as they should.Hugh Grant plays the British Prime Minister who falls in love with his assistant and as usual he is adorable and quirky, especially during his solo dance scene. Emma Thompson plays a wife who exists in a 13 year marriage believing it to be perfect until an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband ends up being for someone else. Your heart will break as she pulls herself together while Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background, "Both Sides Now." Liam Neeson is a recent widower who spends the film helping his adolescent son cope with his first case of puppy love....really adorable and holding all of the innocence that young love somehow always contains. Laura Linney is the ever responsible sister of a handicapped brother who is never able to break herself away from her duties in order to pursue her love interest, although she reaches that pinnacle of greatest accomplishment in unrequited love, that perfect moment where it all appears to work. Colin Firth is a writer who falls in love with a foreign maid while trying to work. His pursuit is both funny and touching as he learns another language and obviously does not master it while pulling an entire little town into his pursuit of love and relays the fact that love really can cross those awkward barriers. All of the rest of the stories are just as intriguing and often times gut wrenching for romantics.A perfect film to watch when love treats you wrong and you need to feel right. You will be reminded of all those simple treats that come with love. From innocent starry-eyed puppy love all the way through to a lengthy marriage that is safe and secure despite the wretched boredom. It shows you that love can work and even if it doesn't another flicker will always come along if you let it. The soundtrack is its own character as great background music influences many of the scenes. It is corny, campy, silly, touching, at times stiff and then again provocative....its actually all that love is in all of its various shapes and forms.

This book was created by a Japanese psychologist and is supposed to be a study of the mind or spirit based on solid psychological principles. I am not sure how accurate the results are but I will vouch for an entertaining experience. This book contains 53 situations all with a choice of responses and a key to what your particular response means. The idea behind the games is to reveal hidden beliefs and attitudes about love, work, relationships and other important avenues in life. You might be surprised at what you hide inside!

This CD is a classic that endures all the fickleness of time. George Michael has mastered an imaginative mix of upbeat and cool tunes with beautiful musical arrangements."Faith" is a great upbeat jingle that never fails to get you moving. "Father Figure" is as close to perfect as an artist can get. "I Want Your Sex" is a fun club beat. "One More Try" a slow sad song with great music behind it. "Hard Day" my personal favorite track on the CD because of the heavy bass. "Hand To Mouth" is jazzy and easy to listen to, nice drum influences. "Look At Your Hands" this one could have been left off. "Monkey" another dance mix. "Kissing A Fool" so here is where the 40's jazz begins. You will be able to listen to this CD over and over again and across many years. Have faith!!!

Nice try filmmakers......but the original version of this classic zombie movie cannot be extinguished with a few more sophisticated special effects.George Romero's original movie from 1978 is still one of the greatest horror films of all time with its touch of humor, graphic gore and subtle political statements it is impossible to better. Zack Snyder has attempted to bring the original story into a new light but in my opinion he fails miserably. The story has changed and the whole concept has been modernized so that the ultimate thrill is found in the updated special effects and new zombie make-up. Sadly even the campy Romero zombies, made-up in the color of sick blueberries, outdo the new zombies. There is just something about slow moving, moaning, flesh-eating dead people, who get to invade a shopping mall and fumble around to "muzak" that just can't be beat. Snyder would have fared better had he chosen to maintain the original film's integrity and storyline.The cast in this film is decent (except for the zombies) with Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Bruce Bohne and Sarah Polley being the most convincing of the actors. The zombies are scary and somehow very fast and strong in this film but the best make-up only enforces the fact that they are made-up actors. Some scenes in this film are better than many others but none really compare to the original film. The best part of this movie lies in the mystery that takes place during the ending credits....don't switch menus too quickly! Zack Snyder gave it a good try but he hasn't created a classic...that accomplishment can only be attributed to a true master George Romero.

I expected more from this highly touted film by Steven Soderbergh but sadly I felt lost and unaffected throughout the entire experience.I know this film is supposed to be artsy and creative, something profound that only a few really dedicated souls can figure out. I understand the movie within a movie concept and I get the need for all the grainy, jittery camera shots but I think this film went too far into the ozone layer for the average person to comprehend its full meaning.David Hyde Pierce, Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood, and a few other notables did good acting jobs but their characters were never really explained and then when they were things changed anyway so the theories once held were quickly swept away. David Duchovny is the "frontal" that caused all the uproar when this film originally opened, but if you blink you will miss what you came to see and it's dead anyway!I hoped for more from Soderbergh but the interesting writing found on a few of the stories never seemed to tie all together in the end. I walked away completely confused and unsatisfied; it just wasn't a picture for me.

A great comedy with perfect casting adds a twist to the old classic "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."Successful NY yuppie Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) has a busy weekend ahead of him, he gets canned from his job and must find a way to impress his soon to be in-laws. But there is a snag, that good old racial divide rears its ugly head. Green's fianc&eacute;e, Theresa Jones (Zo Saldana) just happens to be of another race but that's where all the fun begins. Meet Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) a racist for the sake of his race but mostly just a stern and caring father who would probably not accept any man being good enough for his baby. Will they bond or disagree? Finding out is the fun part!In yet another "meet the parents" farce issues of race are dealt with respectfully and with great humor. Bernie Mac is fantastic as the rigid and successful father. Perfectly matched to Mac's humor is the often ineptly funny Ashton Kutcher, together the actors feed one another and form a perfect comedy team. The other actors pale in comparison to Mac-Kutcher but they offer the proper support for the wise-cracks. Let the competition begin because it a great one!

Despite the dark story that lurks behind the comedy in this film it is entirely entertaining from beginning to end.Larry (Billy Crystal) is a creative writing teacher with a class full of inept writers. He is divorced from a woman (Kate Mulgrew) who has taken his novel and "written" it herself and is now receiving all the glory. Larry is stewing. One of Larry's students, Owen (Danny DeVito), becomes obsessed with a murder mystery he is working on and he follows Larry around hoping for a moment of his attention. Owen has issues....his Momma (Anne Ramsey). The fun begins with a mistaken clue being taken by Owen to mean that he and Larry should criss-cross their anger and murder one another's nemesis and it all leads to a completely amusing journey into the dark part of a suffering mind.Danny DeVito is the king of black comedy and here he stars and directs with a talented ability to find humor in the darkest desires. Along with Billy Crystal they complete a madcap comedy duo in search of some relief from those who taunt their insecurities. The stand out talent in this film is of course Anne Ramsey, who as Momma, will make you roar with laughter....you stupid poop! For you writers out there this movie takes a great look at the inevitable block that stares us in the face every now and then. Get ready to laugh and store this classic close at hand to re-watch time and again when your own heart feels a little heavy and you need a dose of Momma to ease the pain.

This movie is an exquisite masterpiece of cinematography and direction. The Academy missed its important message and passed on an excellent acting performance by Tom Cruise.Filmed in New Zealand it takes on the persona of 19th century Japan. The villages and costumes are so authentic that you are transported back into a beautiful time, with lush vegetation and a purity of living. The film is soothing and spiritual despite the battle scenes.Tom Cruise plays a civil war captain who has lost his integrity after fighting and killing Indians alongside of General Custer. He becomes a drunk wallowing in drink rather than deal with the guilt and trauma of war. A Shogun, working for the Emperor of Japan, employs his expertise in war to train the Imperial Army. During this time in history the Emperor was trying to modernize Japan and defeat the control that the Samurai had over his land. Because of the heartfelt beliefs of the Samurai's they rejected a modern Japan feeling as though a &quot;western&quot; culture would bring too much distance from true integrity. After watching this movie you may think differently about the enforcement of democracy on a culture steeped in ancient values.The battle scenes are epic and real, extreme attention is given to each and every detail. The warrior costumes appear historically accurate and a tribute to the Samurai culture. Cruise is captured in battle by the Samurai and eventually adapts to the culture that heals his integrity again. The sword fighting scenes are flawless and powerful. His adaption into this ancient society is impressively spiritual and he gains his belief in himself through code of the Samurai: Honesty &amp; Justice, Duty &amp; Loyality, Polite Courtesy, Compassion, Complete Sincerity, Heroic Courage and Honor. We could all use such healing.Although Samurai's have a place in history as brutal warriors and warlords this movie will give new meaning to their way of life. Is a true warrior someone who bombs individuals without looking his enemy in the eye or is honor to be found only through the way of the Samurai? It is an interesting concept to debate. Sometimes simplicity is the only honorable choice and quite possibly wars should only be fought by the code of these honorable men.

This film from 1989 is an absolute timeless gem. Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give stunningly sensitive performances as a Southern Jewish woman and her Negro chauffer during the most racist of times in America.The characters in this film are filled with depth and an openness that allows them to be touchable by all classes of people. Living in the Deep South Miss Daisy begins to lose her ability to drive and her son hires a poor black man to be her devoted chauffer. The relationship between these two very different people results in a 25 year long friendship. The story has been adapted skillfully from a play into this extraordinary film well worth watching time and again.Jessica Tandy won an Oscar for her role as Daisy Werthan, a widowed Jewish woman. She comes across distant and harsh at first but viewers soon learn she is just protecting her fear and lack of confidence. She is funny at times and vulnerable at others but entirely well-rounded and likable. The old school teacher mentality dies slowly in Miss Daisy and she bosses people around like crazy, reminding those of us familiar with old southern women who wears the pants. As Daisy ages her circumstances begin to change and she must rely on those who have surrounded her as loyal servants and family. But her strength lies hidden in the scenes where she teaches Hoke to read and where she discovers the true loyalty of her faithful friend/chauffer along with her encouragement as she listens to the Martin Luther King Jr. speech.As Hoke, the loyal chauffer, Morgan Freeman shines! He is humble, patient and compassionate in his role as Miss Daisy's driver. Hoke treats Miss Daisy with respect but he also has no qualms about putting her in her place every now and then. He relates to her during scenes where the two of them face racism from the good ole boy white police, a Jew and a colored man in the old south...imagine that! Because of the brilliance with which Freeman plays Hoke, we are able to imagine what it must have taken to endure during such an evil time. Freeman ages along with Tandy and the 25 year old friendship lasts throughout the years without faltering.Not short on talent are supporting actors, Dan Aykroyd and Esther Rolle. Aykroyd plays Miss Daisy's son, Boolie, with tremendous Southern character. Esther Rolle is Miss Daisy's housekeeper who loyally grumbles along behind Miss Daisy's back with a great sense of humor as only Esther Rolle was capable of. Films with great supporting members are often few and far between but thankfully this film only deepens in meaning because of these two great actors.This film is fantastic in many ways but most especially in how it brings to light the fear involved in aging and losing the functions of individual independence. Racism is graced upon and passed over as it should have done in real life allowing people to just be people and not a color or creed. The message remains timeless, that true friendships endure the harshest of circumstances and changes with the times surpassing all of the stupid prejudices that society conjures up.

I read this book after I had travelled to Paris and experienced a small part of French culture. After I read it I wish I would have gone to Provence.Peter Mayle's memoir of relocating to Provence from England is laugh out loud funny. Like many of us Mr. Mayle fumbles about as he learns new things and manages to entertain his readers with his follies. So sit back with a glass of wine, cheese and a comfortable chair and enjoy!

Whew......I have just finished reading "My Life" and I am walking away from it with a much better understanding of who Bill Clinton really is.I decided to read this book, not because I ever consider myself a fan of Bill Clinton, but because I felt open to trying to understand the man behind an 8 year Presidency. I discovered in the process that the man represented by the media is at best incomplete. I also discovered that for all Clinton's faults he managed to serve our nation with strength and a relentless pursuit towards a more global America. For this I have developed a respect where there once was none. I am more aware now of the spins placed on the presidency by our media and by all of the jealous few who do not have the backbone to sit in the seat at the highest pinnacle while being in constant judgment by the entire world. It appears easy from the couch I imagine but it is much different in reality. Clinton has written an insightful account of what it must be like to exist on the top when everyone is bent on bringing you down. His presidency was so much more than "girlygate" and his contributions to our society should be admired and respected whether or not we follow his beliefs. For democracy to exist we must be willing to change our minds when necessary, to allow for expansion and growth as individuals and as human beings existing in a world much bigger than ourselves. This book provides the opportunity for those willing to get beyond the stigmas and prejudices that cause our nation such grief.The best part of "My Life" in my opinion is Clinton's early years. Clinton writes about how he emerged from a normal childhood into greatness. He learned lessons along the way that formed his democratic convictions and enlightened him to the injustices of poverty, racism and prejudices. I found myself relating to him almost toe to toe in his early years and realized one of the reasons he succeeded where others like him have failed, is because he never had to hear the word "can't." Although he was surrounded in Southern prejudices and felt hatred and despair he was able to move beyond the grips of failing. So many people become traumatized when faced with the same circumstances that they end up fading away into oblivion rather than finding a way to make a difference, for this alone I applaud Clinton for his ability to fight life's adversities and maintain compassion in a damaged heart.I found myself absolutely enthralled with Clinton's relationships with leaders from other nations. He encouraged a true global perspective on how a world ought to be run and tried his best to find happy meeting grounds to all of those he encountered. In 8 years Clinton never fell to the power trip of taking America into war. He utilized our forces when necessary, made his point and got out without many enemies internationally. He formed friendships and powerful political ties with Rabin, Arafat, Chirac, Yeltsin, Kohl, King Hussein, Obuchi, Zemin, Mandela and many other noteworthy international leaders. His efforts in North Korea, Bosnia, Israel, Russia, Northern Ireland and China led to peaceful agreements and solutions on the verge of occurrence. Clinton braved visits to Palestinian refugee camps with Arafat, North Korea, Pakistan during an uprising, China, and war-torn Bosnia. He admits his failures in Africa, specifically Rwanda and mentions that going forward his focus will remain on establishing better living conditions in that continent. But the most profound statement that I came across in this book was Clinton's idea that terrorism can be controlled through education, nutrition and better living conditions in poverty stricken countries because terrorism stopped in childhood is a better defense than igniting more hate. I wish more leaders conformed to this philosophy!While I still believe Clinton caused some of his own problems I also see how he was relentlessly pursued to fail by the likes of Gingrich, Dole and Kenneth Starr. I remember being one of the bandwagon members during his investigations fully believing all of the stories I was being told by the media. Now that I see the other side of such sensationalized stories I can better appreciate Clinton's strength of character. He ran our country successfully where many lesser men would have failed under similar circumstances. For that he needs to be given credit. As for his apparent weaknesses towards women, whether it be right or wrong, it is merely a downfall of thousands of powerful men, imagine Jefferson and his slave Sally pursued by the media today! Men will be men. But what really makes a man is a willingness to admit failure and Clinton clearly does just that in many paragraphs throughout this book.In my opinion this book fails in only one regard: it really needed a better editor. Clinton rambles on and on about seemingly each and every person he ever met in his entire life. Some statements are simply unimportant and should have been omitted entirely. Others could have been elaborated upon. It also would have been nice to have full chapters devoted to one international issue rather than reading bit parts here and there all through the book. It becomes confusing if you are not a master of international history and all of its components.I believe this book is well worth the read regardless of your political views. It is historical, candid, interesting and at points even emotionally profound. Whether or not you like Clinton as a leader as a person he is worthy of respect and someone who continues to represent our nation internationally and in good faith. Going forward his focus will be on "overcoming poverty, ignorance, disease and bad government" as a way to end all of the hatred than stems from ignoring the true cause of terrorism. Clinton writes that through virtues such as hope, faith and love our world may no longer have to "see through a glass darkly." My Life will inspire you towards a richer involvement in American politics, a desire to serve rather than complain and encourage you to be active in this great big world despite all of its problems. Bravo, Mr. Clinton!

Once again a really good, almost epic, film is overlooked by a great majority. This movie is well worth its weight!The story begins in 1880 England with a handful of British soldiers preparing for war in Sudan. One soldier falls in love and makes the unheard of decision to leave the army rather than face death. But the very reason the soldier quits blames him for being a coward and the relationship ends. The soldier, played respectfully well by Heath Ledger, becomes an outcast but finds his way to the Sudan in order to help his friends. Watch the movie for the complete story because it is complicated, deep and troubling. The question that comes to mind is what would you do for your friends? Just how much should a brave man sacrifice in order to be courageous and accepted in society? This movie will bring about all sorts of deep rooted questions about the rights and wrongs of war and friendships.In my opinion the best actor in this film is Djimon Hounsou who plays a desert wanderer who rescues Heath Ledger in the Sudanese desert. Hounsou believes that God has placed Ledger in his path and that he is responsible for protecting him during the rest of the film. Again the question of what qualifies as a friendship enters the mind. Is a true lasting friendship worthy of death? I believe we would all be so lucky to fall into the path of such a man as Hounsou portrays....they are few and far between.The main focus of this film is the war between the British and the Sudanese. The scenes are well directed and powerful. The fancy professional soldiers don't stay pretty for long in the brutality of the desert. It becomes apparent that as usual a big powerfully choreographed army does not have all that it takes to fight native warriors protecting their land from invasion. The British expect the nomads to fight a war exactly as they do without taking into consideration the history and behaviors ingrained within such people who fight with swords and brutality rather than pumped up ammunition. It all sounds somehow familiar! Needless to say you may begin to look at the rights and wrongs of war after watching this movie. Is it really right to take over another country without permission from the occupants?As I said many questions will arise during the viewing of this film, it is deep and moving with reflection. Interestingly enough the message contained in this film appears to be timeless as it appears humanity still insists on creating war instead of peaceful negotiations. White feathers are distributed to cowards, at least in 1880 England, but this movie might convince you who really should receive the feather, for bravery comes in many forms.

Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore made this documentary in 1989 but it is sadly still very pertinent for American life in 2004, it is still a tale of big corporations making a mountain of money at the expense of middle class and poor workers.Michael Moore is a pest, irritating and opinionated to the ninth degree but I admire him like no other, what other American is willing to take as many stabs at his reputation and just keep on filming the truth? I agree that some of his films have moments that go over the top for conservative Republican types but for us humble left wingers he remains one of our richest voices against the machine called "corporate America." Moore is thinner and youthful in this film from 1989 but he was just as badgering and willing to take a fall then as he is now. In this film he takes on the devastating affect that GM and its Chairman, Roger B. Smith make on the town of Flint, Michigan when they choose to close down the manufacturing plant located there. Moore is filmed in his many attempts to meet with Smith only to be met by constant refusals; it seems Smith wasn't able to stand up to his own heat! One subject in the film states that the corporate world is all about making money and this film brings that awful truth to a head as 18,000 workers loose their jobs in Flint, MI.Moore has a way of filming that sets forth the truth, adds a touch of humor and then stops your heart. He shows how the rich only get stronger, while under the blanket of corporate security, while the security the workers expect can be pulled out from underneath them before they have a chance to right themselves. GM was financially strong during the time this film was made but it still decided to lay off over 30,000 workers from several plants in America so that it could move the facilities to Mexico and only have to pay the new workers seven cents an hour.....well you just can't beat that, right? Amazingly so this very same issue is a forefront in today's political agenda, do we, or don't we? I believe Moore is trying to say no! When American workers suffer with layoffs and entire town devastations the rest of America eventually suffers as well, unless you live in a manor overlooking a lake and have the letters CEO attached to your name of course. Moore follows Roger B. Smith to private clubs and films a Christmas speech while intermittently showing the GM workers being physically evicted from their homes. Pretty powerful stuff!Many aspects of this film are significant, some of the cleverest scenes revolve around displaced workers trying to make ends meet and the continuous stream of people being forcibly evicted from scraps that they have made into homes. Where can the justice be in a woman with small children being taken from a home with a caved in roof, should rent really be paid on a rat hole? I can just imagine the landlord on Christmas day! Another scene that bothered me is one in which a woman tries to make a living by skinning her rabbits; it's a brutal scene and not one for animal lovers or anyone who disguises where the meat on their table came from. So the saga of Flint continues and hopefully the heart of Michael Moore will carry on until this very American problem is resolved, the middle class is becoming poor and the poor falling off the face of the earth into oblivion if we keep up what we are doing. For now we need Moore's unwavering voice to spread the bad news and hope for a better way because "Roger" could be coming to your town next.

The French have done it again.....this time the magnificence comes in the form of a cartoon with great music.Sylvain Chomet directs this wonderful adult animation film and manages to capture all of the qualities of the French in his cartoon characters. Without many words the characters perform brilliantly, not an ounce of misunderstanding to be found! The story begins in a small cottage with a young boy, his grandmother and a puppy. The grandmother finds a hobby for the boy and he soon grows up to be a cyclist on his way to the Tour de France. The grandmother is short, stout and capable of anything. She trains her grandson by riding behind him on a tricycle blowing a whistle in time. The puppy grows into a very large dog that waddles to the window every 15 minutes to bark at trains that pass. The boy becomes an obsessed cyclist programmed to do only one thing, peddle! The individual characteristics are very French and very funny.More characters exist as the story unfolds and we meet square suited mafia men, stereotypical townspeople and most importantly the "Triplets of Belleville," a trio of old ladies who make strange noises and create music from everyday appliances while eating everything frog! The entire gaggle of characters ends up in a chase through the streets of the fictional town of Belleville with amazing scenic effects for a cartoon.This animated film is nothing like I have ever seen. It does not have the big-eyed innocence of Disney, or the animated ingenuity of Pixar but it has all of the most perfect qualities of the French, style, sophistication and depth. The characters are fantastic and highly likable and the music that surrounds the film more than makes up for the lack of spoken words. Simply fantastic!!

If you love a good mystery and a few titillating shots for good measure this French film will knock your Speedos off.Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a mystery writer who specializes in solving murder plots but she has become disenchanted with her direction and with her unrequited relationship with her publisher. His suggestion is that she takes some time away and re-think her concepts so she is whisked away to his beautiful home in Southern France. To Sarah's surprise and disappointment her publisher never visits but his incorrigible daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) does. Sarah discovers that Julie is hiding a past that has caused her to be sexually promiscuous and irresponsible but Sarah is drawn to her youthful vigor and experimentation. Let the games begin! Sarah discovers a new avenue to pursue in her writing and Julie seeks the approval of a mother she lost. Together the women form bonds that cross a few lines and create disaster.Yet another French film has succeeded in stumping the typical American audience who it seems gets lost behind in the nudity and spectacular flaunting of the beautiful Sagnier. But it's the story that is more impressive here. French director Francois Ozon has created a visually stunning film that seduces with much more than a few breast shots. Well written and complex this movie will fool you until the very end. To truly get what you have just witnessed it requires a few viewings and a mind that doesn't get lost on a naked body here and there. I found the story to be as brilliant as this film was hyped up to be and I can't imagine how anyone could find it disappointing. But the French don't need a stuffed Speedo to be brilliant; their cinematic seduction arrives in a much more subtle way... so dive in and enjoy a little swim with a filmmaker who knows what he is doing.

For those of you who had a love affair with the original Starsky & Hutch detective series from the 70's you will find this movie quite entertaining.Ben Stiller is nearly perfect as the serious Starsky, he even takes on many of the mannerisms and scowls that the original character embodied. Stiller makes this film with his dry humor. Playing opposite Stiller is Owen Wilson who creates a new Hutch. Wilson is quirky and somehow sexy in a very funny way. These two actors make a brand new comedy team and you won't be disappointed in this film if you enjoy the way they tag team off one another for a laugh. Of course Snoop Dog does a great job as Huggy Bear too and the red and white Grand Terino takes on the original car with a few new tricks!This movie is a great laugh and an evening of nostalgia for people who grew up watching the original series. Many scenes are re-created almost to a perfect tee! The 70's clothing deserves a shout out as well! The only negative aspect I found was in the dimwitted women, like Carmen Electra, who dance across the screen every now and then without much meaning. Otherwise this movie is a comedy gem and worth watching more than once. Look for the cameos of the original Starsky and Hutch and try not to feel too old!

After all of the promotional hype I expected something more from this movie than a catty meow! But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon.Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a "cat-burglar" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham.This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film "Batman Returns" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty. Sadly Halle should stick to what she does best DRAMA and leave the meowing to another litter of up and coming starlets without their reputation at stake.

This little gem of a movie is unexpectedly wonderful. It seems like a beautiful French love story at first and twists into something quite different.....But I won't give it all away.Audrey Tautou is perfect as the young student who falls in love with an attractive Doctor. Her innocence sucks you in and she is absolutely believable as a youthful exuberant woman in love. But beauty is what it is and sometimes it is what it isn't, be prepared to be taken on a surprising ride. Sometimes love takes on new meaning, especially for the young and easily influenced.This film is artfully directed with beautiful colors surrounding the scenes. It is all things French.....and highly recommended!

Quentin Tarantino expands his "Kill Bill" film with this movie KB Pt. II. This film answers all those questions that crept into your psyche during part one.While KB Pt. I was filled with unanswered questions, many fight scenes and brutal killings this film (Pt. II) is more on a psychological mission than a physical one. In a way this movie is the Western version of the East/West duo. The film still focuses upon the story of "The Bride" (Uma Thurman) and her revenge quest against those who wronged her. Most importantly in this film we finally get to meet Bill, played with interest by David Carradine. Together Thurman and Carradine take the audience on another uniquely original ride directed by Tarantino.KB Part II has less brutality and sadly less Kung Fu. But in this film we are able to understand the characters better and the tortures they are faced with are more psychological in origin. We meet "Bill," and the man "The Bride" intended to marry, Daryl Hannah has a significant part in the saga, Michael Madsen provides some interesting sensitivity, and finally the Kung Fu master Pai Mei (played by Chia Hui Liu) makes his debut training Thurman on to brilliance. This film is done with many black & white scenes and old western type scenes, while the music in the background sounds a little like an old spaghetti western from Italy I once saw.This film is less intense than Part I but more grueling psychologically. One great fight scene is not to be missed between Thurman and Hannah of course! Tarantino manages to keep the viewers interested while creating a completely different movie from Part I, but watch them both and experience something unique and interesting, with stunning visuals and great music.

The Wayans Brothers have managed to create a very funny film despite the obvious "drag-queen" gags and stabs at the differences between blacks and rich whites.This movie is laugh out loud funny and you may even find something in it to make you even laugh at yourself....we are all at risk when the Wayans are involved! Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and starring his two hilarious brothers, Marlon and Shawn, there are so many silly moments it will keep you in stitches. Marlon and Shawn are FBI agents who begin by messing up a stake out in a convenience store only to embark on another case in which they must pose as two rich heiresses in order to protect them from a kidnapping. Needless to say it sounds impossible for two handsome black men to suddenly become two likable white chicks but somehow the makeup artists manage to almost pull it off. While the initial gag rests in the fact that men are attempting to act like two cute women the true gags come in the surrounding material, with an excellent cast of comedians pulling it all off with brilliance.Marlon and Shawn Wayans are truly funny in their roles as rich white chickies, they perfect the mannerisms and accents of spoiled "valley girls" while retaining just enough of their bumbling machismo to make the act even funnier. The reference to botok and silicon only makes their plastic made up faces all the more believable because we all see enough of those zombie women running around to believe a frozen cosmetic face works in our society. Surrounding the brothers is a great cast of characters all playing up the snobbish idea of life as a rich white Hamptonite complete with shopping tips (wear open toed shoes if you have a size 14 foot and buy a 12!), cosmetic slumber parties, valley girl music and Prada, Prada, Prada. The funniest character in this film however is played by Terry Crews, as basketball player Latrell Spencer, who has an appetite for rich white meat. With every stereotypical slap presented Crews just plays along and does so brilliantly and he shines during a scene where he serenades his date with a very frilly white chick song!This movie is great for a day of laughing, at yourself and others. It is silly and meant to just be entertaining. Although the Wayans brothers could never be mistaken for real women this movie would have failed if they had perfected the art of real drag-queens. The true creativity in this film comes exactly from the imperfections, something we all have but too many of us try to cover up under layers of plastic at least the Wayans can still smile and laugh under theirs.

This film has a great cast but for lovers of intrigue and murder mysteries I have to say this movie fell short on explanation.Robert Redford plays a retired but very successful businessman who leaves his home one morning and finds himself in quite a predicament. His wife, Helen Mirren, reports him missing once he fails to turn up for a dinner party. William Dafoe becomes Redford's new partner in the film and through a series of revelations on the past it becomes apparent that Redford isn't exactly on the up and up, but neither is Dafoe and as the movie progresses I began to wonder about Mirren as well. Eventually most of the story is revealed and it all makes sense but unfortunately all of the suspense was for nothing....the movie explains itself within the first 10 minutes and all of the usual suspects need not even be suspected after all!The cast in this film is wonderful and their superb acting cannot be faulted. Robert Redford and Helen Mirren are great as a couple that has grown to understand one another after many years of respectful marriage. Of course Willem Dafoe is absolutely convincing as the floundering failure in this film. Two stories take place simultaneously with the director weaving in and out of both stories sometimes to a point of confusion. But the real treat of this film is not with the direction, or the story, but instead lies entirely in the brilliance of the actors and their subdued performances against the backdrop of an unclear case.

Joan Anderson has written a really lovely book of independence strength and fulfillment during a crucial period in a woman's life- and it's all true! I would love to be free myself of the constraints that men often put upon us as women and spend time alone to ponder on life and where I am headed, so this book was right up my ally. I think I would have stayed on my own unlike Joan however the sea and the seals all sounded so peaceful and beautiful to wake up to every day!! I highly recommend this book to women struggling for survival amongst the demands of family.

This book should be required reading. Within the pages of this book a wealth of knowledge about hatred, prejudice and the human's desire to survive, exists.Wladyslaw Szpilman was one man who survived a living hell during the Holocaust of WWII. His story is better than great and gut wrenching. Residing in Poland and living a happy life as a Jewish pianist, Szpilman, shows no signs of his upcoming peril. Slowly his world crumbles and hoards of Polish Jews are herded around like cattle, killed and tortured in the streets and separated from their loved ones. Szpilman manages to defy death often and unthinkably. Soon he is faced with living alone in a city that no longer exists except in ruins. He eats whatever he can find, molded bread and insect infested oatmeal or flour. He drinks water left behind in canisters reeking of chemicals and drowning with insects. He avoids fire, bombings, torture but most importantly capture. His entire family is killed after they are carted away to the Nazi gas chambers but somehow this gentle man finds a reason to survive. He witnesses bodies blown apart, severed heads, crying babies stuffed in bags, dead rotting corpses litter his streets and in the end his only friend is a charred and bloated corpse he must pass over everyday for shelter. Would you, could you survive?I read this book in one day because I was unable to tear myself away from the heart of this man's story. I was reminded of the story of Job; here existed a man humble and wise who never succumbed to his suffering. His shoulders were burdened, his heart taxed and his will tested yet his spirit never wavered. Not once does he mention his hatred for the Germans, not once does he allow himself to sit back and feel sorry for himself and not once does he doubt that the war that has torn his country apart will end. Szpilman is true inspiration and the definition of hope. He writes of his survival with all of his senses intact, relating the horrible smell of rotting flesh, the taste of moldy food, the sound of death, the touch of a human being and sights of a living hell. Szpilman's true story has been made into the award winning film, "The Pianist," and the film graciously captured almost each and every account of horror that Szpilman experienced.The most profound thing that I read in this book was the account of Szpilman being discovered by a German officer and the humanity that the officer summoned up in his soul. Both men face the chance for brutality and hatred to invade their emotions yet the two "enemies" are able to reach past the barriers society placed upon them and realize where right and wrong exists. This German soldier is another brave soul, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, and because of his compassion for Szpilman, he helps him to survive until the war finally ends. Excerpts from Captain Hosenfeld's diary can be found at the end of this book and deserve to be read as well. Hosenfeld questions and answers why the Jewish people don't defend themselves, he recognizes that where godlessness exists so does hate, and he expresses his concern for the German nation to recover from all of the atrocities that his own country has allowed by forsaking the Jewish people. A soldier fighting a war he no longer believes in is a sad existence! This book allows us to see that good and bad exists within us all and that it is purely a matter of our strength of spirit that dictates where we will turn when faced with tragedy. Szpilman's spirit deserves your attention, his heart deserves your compassion and his life deserves respect.

Having recently bought a farm in the country I had to read this memoir in order to prepare for what I had gotten myself into.Laskas writes with humor and reality about uprooting herself and her city man to the country. Many stories are humorous like mule buying, tractor trading, weed wacking, and the concept of a fancy French poodle who gets car sick becomming a country dog. Sadly some stories are tragic like when Laskas loses her loyal pet cat and when her neighbor battles cancer. Good and bad all part of real life and written well. So sit back and enjoy your work has only just begun!

For Sci-Fi lovers this is probably a great movie but for people who prefer their romance stories on earth it is a little too spacey.The director for this film is Steven Soderbergh and he tends to capture all of the scenes in dark close-ups of body parts and profiles while new age subliminal music plays in the background. There are too many moments of quiet and unexplained emotions shrouded in the complexities and visual harshness of a space station. The story is interesting but may have worked better on earth rather than aboard an alien type space mobile. Psychologist Kelvin (played by George Clooney) is called to resolve lost communications aboard a space station in orbit around an alien planet. From this point we are left to contemplate the circumstances taking place aboard the craft.George Clooney is decent in his role as a space psychologist attempting to resolve a mystery aboard a space station, but he has way too many dark close-ups. Aboard the ship he tries to deal with eerie circumstances that involve dead loved ones seeming to come back to the crew members in dreams or is it in reality. Jeremy Davies plays a kooky crew member who actually looks a little too much like Charles Manson to be likable! Clooney's wife is played nicely by Natascha McElhone. Clooney and McElhone pass back and forth between dreams and reality, future and past during their romance and old issues are brought forth in an attempt to re-configure them into something more reasonable. But the viewers are left to decide what truth is and what is misconstrued by the alien infection.The ending of this film is abstract and will leave one with a choice between heaven, dreams or reality as the existing environment. Will the future of love exist only under controlled circumstances or will life continue as normal far from the glow of Solaris?

This film is one of the best love stories of all time showing how love can develop from a simple glance or meeting anywhere in the world.Filmed in Vienna the director has managed to take the conversation between two strangers and the beautiful European setting and make a fabulous romance work. He maintains the simplistic integrity all through the film preferring to keep his characters straightforward and thus open to opportunity. The sophisticated conversation develops over a supposed 14 hour period of time that the two people have together and it is both psychologically deep and interesting. And what can you say about Vienna, a beautiful character in itself, holding all the answers just as it did for Freud.Ethan Hawke plays an awkward and unsophisticated American who is taking a Eurorail to Vienna in order to fly back home. He has been rambling about Europe not wanting to go home and face the music of his relationship (with an American student in Spain) having come to an end. Hawke is fantastic in this role showing a vulnerability that is sorely lacking in many young men and entirely captivating to women. Hawke meets a fresh faced and luminous Parisian girl, played by Julie Delpy, while on the Eurorail train and they strike up a conversation so interesting that it exists for the entire film and never gets old or tiresome. Delpy is magnetic as a simple young woman with intelligence and a great adventure for life. Together Hawke and Delpy will have you wrapped around their fingers as their hearts become entangled in the beauty of a grown up romance.If only all strangers were so brilliant to talk to! This easy conversation will leave you pondering the meaning of life and asking yourself or your own loved ones the same questions and hoping for insightful answers. If you love Europe, simple romances and psychology this is the film for you because of its inspiration and profound thinking and of course the beauty of Vienna and the Danube.

I had previously read the book, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; and was passionately impressed. Needless to say I held high hopes for the movie and can honestly say I was not disappointed in any way.Jennifer Connelly plays, Kathy, a depressed hopeless woman who suffers loss after loss until she breaks. Sir Ben Kingsley gives a masterful performance as an Iranian man who has had all of his cultural wealth taken from him prior to arriving in the US. You are torn between rights and wrongs in this film and unlike most stories you are allowed to see two sides. Most stories thrive on good vs. evil, here you are unable to decide and the twists that occur leave you wishing you could help both parties. You will cry at the pride and at the despair of human beings facing choices that bind them for life. Brilliant!!

For lovers of foreign films this German creation is wonderful and a true gift for the senses.I found this film to be well written despite the simplicity of the storyline. Martha (Martina Gedeck) is a head chef at a prestigious restaurant, her life is a mess but her culinary creations something to be celebrated. Her world is turned upside down when her sister is accidentally killed and Martha is left to care for her sister's daughter (Maxime Foerste). As she struggles to adapt to a new life and schedule that involves a depressed and independent niece, the restaurant she works for makes a few changes of its own and hires another chef (Sergio Castellitto) who adds a bit of Italian charm to the picture. All of the actors are superb but the food really makes an award winning presentation of its own.This foreign film is so beautiful and appeals to every sense imaginable that I guarantee you will be up and cooking yourself a great meal after watching this one. With almost every scene filmed around a plate of elegant food your taste buds will water and your stomach will stir. Somehow you can even smell the basil, sage and pungent sauces brewing in the background. Alongside the extraordinary cooking is a joyous soundtrack of uplifting music to cater to your ears. The story is one of possibilities and new families being formed from all sorts of ingredients but mostly it's a purely sensual experience.

When did divorce become a laughing matter? I only laugh when it is done darkly and with more effort than what was exerted on this movie.The Coen Brothers normally bring magic and obscurity to the screen in their movies but this film is sadly lacking much originality. The story revolves around sneaky, greedy lawyers and gold-digger Hollywood wives who try to outdo one another all for a little cash. It isn't a story deeply thought out or highly imaginative as I suspect the same story has been told over and over again by many other filmmakers with less of a gift for a gag.George Clooney only added some pretty white choppers and a decent face to the screen. His character is shallow and not very funny, Clooney tried, but nothing happened in my opinion. Catherine Zeta-Jones comes across somehow too familiar as the vain and money hungry Hollywood wife bent on marriage and divorce one too many times. In a land filled with Botok, silicon, and far too much time you would have thought something funny could have been found to talk about. The bright spots in the film are offered by Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Cedric (the Entertainer) as sidekicks to the pretty regulars. The Coen Brothers would have fared better leaving the pretty out and adding a little more ugly and then maybe this film would be somehow tolerable to get through.

Finally, an interesting, timeless and understandable classic that has at least one character that will appeal and bring recognition to every reader, Tolstoy is a master at storytelling and this epic novel is absolutely exquisite.The title character, Anna Karenina, is the essence of selfishness and seduction, living life as a married and wealthy woman who abhors her older husband she finds another truth. In parallel another searching soul, Konstantin Levin, finds a different truth following a deep and abiding heart. Tolstoy mastered the ability to include two stories into one with this novel almost giving his readers a choice between living life right and choosing to live life wrong. The results convey the consequences of each character's actions. Interestingly enough the two main characters never directly connect until the novel comes towards its end although Anna and Levin have been remotely connected through other characters throughout the book. The story is complex but certainly far from cumbersome.As for the tragic romance of the character Anna Karenina I found her to be unkind at best. She may be extraordinarily beautiful and capable of seducing the charms of any man but she never fooled me. As a woman I began by feeling sorry for her desperation and her confusion over loving security versus passion. But I soon realized that she is a grown woman, spoiled and pampered but most importantly a mother and I felt her choices should have been more responsible. Her life reflects her inability to make mature decisions and I often thought back to the exuberance and silliness of youth as I read her tale. By the end of the novel I was not surprised to find her ultimate choice completely wrapped up in herself and in disregard for anyone she ever "loved." Tolstoy clearly captured all the excess of a life lived for oneself and the self-absorption of the beautiful in his title character.I found my heart following Konstantin Levin in his liberal pursuit of happiness and connection to the world. He turns away from the profanities of wealth and becomes a hands-on farmer with an understanding for the poor muzhiks who sow his fields by his side. Levin represents the hard working class and he gives voice to his servants rather than abusing them as the rich tend to do. He is a man tortured by questions regarding his faith and if God in fact exists. This exploration by Tolstoy is mind opening and something to read often. Levin is a character who knows about love, both unrequited and committed and this character is a man after my heart! His strength is in his being and his richness in his soul while the rest of society insists on finding their wealth superficially he maintains an integrity not found in other characters. I will be forever perplexed as to why this classic tale did not carry Levin's name rather than Anna's.I recommend this novel to everyone! Despite its length and the intimidation of being a classic written by a Russian it is an easy and absorbing read. The complexities of each character are well thought out and explained in many ways by Tolstoy. This novel is worthy of its classic status because it is timeless. All of the triumphs and tragedies of life and love in this 1870's novel apply strangely enough today and it is completely relatable. My favorite line from this immense novel is, "If good has a cause, it is no longer the good; if it has a consequence - a reward - it is also not the good. Therefore the good is outside the chain of cause and effect." Tolstoy not only writes brilliantly but he teaches with great enlightenment as well. The wealth in this novel is not with Anna Karenina but in Tolstoy's constant message to live life well and to seek personal fulfillment outside of the inhibitions of love.

Jane Fonda has managed to write an intelligent and forthright autobiography, one deserving of more than just a half-hearted glance.....it deserves to be read entirely.Ms. Fonda writes eloquently about her life "so far" in three stages: childhood, middle-age and her awakening life as an elder single woman. With almost 70 years under her belt she continues to be smart as well as a spectacular specimen of what a real woman should strive to become. Yes, Fonda is one-sided in her political views but most definitely never self-serving and she has managed to conduct her life with an unfathomable integrity, something I defy her critics to arise towards. Her views do not waver or change with the current fad she staunchly protests war and its entire backlash. Despite appearing a harsh liberal, traitor and even the ultimate bimbo (Barberella...Yikes!) in reality she is more than just a surface ornament instead Ms. Fonda grows riper and wiser with each day while the rest of us waste away into old prunes.So what interest lies in this autobiography that anyone who isn't rich and famous will relate to? Just about everything! Sure Fonda had the typical bad parental upbringing but she has eventually moved beyond excuses....a skill we can all learn from. She had the chance to be a huge sexy star in Hollywood but gave up a fancy yet empty career to try and make a difference in the world as she saw it....we could all be more useful. And of course she had her share of crappy relationships......no need to explain that one! But the gift that Fonda extends with this book is one of insight, growth, forgiveness and responsibility....something few of us manage at the end of our days. So as she nears 70 she is happy, fit, healthy, strong and most importantly willing to look at herself through honest eyes and fix the things within her control. Would you, could you do the same? Most women in her shoes would be eating bon-bons, buying a face filled with botok and going to a few teas along the way....Fonda remains a true American and refuses to sit back on her laurels and let the time pass away with useless repetition.This autobiography is about more than Vietnam, more than a few films, more than a famous and pampered life instead it is about how one woman used her voice and her wisdom to challenge the things in life that she disagreed with while never wavering even as she waltzes off into her last sunset.....may her special character and voice remain more than a mere whisper!

Finally an answer to a loner's prayers! We are not as strange as the world wants to make us out to be afterall.Anneli Rufus has done a magnificent job telling about life from a loner's perspective and making it all sound capable and NORMAL. She writes chapters on the loner in community, popular culture, films, advertising, friendships, love & sex, technology, art, literature, religion, sanity, crime, eccentricity, clothes, environment, solo adventures and at last childhood. The words are a true manifesto for a loner's hungry soul, finally another person who understands.In a world where loners are thought to be strange, crazy serial killers who cannot conform to society, Rufus encourages the idea that most loners in truth are the great creators and contemplators of the world. Issac Newton, Michaelangelo, writers, artists and philosophers become necessary human beings within all of their secretiveness. Instead of being arrogant attention getting hounds most loners create from the heart and give without a need for recognition, the truly unselfish can be found only in those selfish enough to enjoy being alone.I would have loved to have given this book to a teacher who I had as a child. I remember sitting in a room with my parents while they were told by the "teacher" that she felt I was somehow autistic and withdrawn and might need "special" education. Despite my A's, my ability to pay attention and my athletic ability I was labeled and marked as a failure in her eyes. I wonder how many children today are pegged as something they are not and guided in a wrong direction. It took me 40 years to figure out how unique and completely normal I really am but I would hope after reading this book many others could celebrate the adventure alot sooner. A must read for those of you with quiet, withdrawn children who would rather day dream than stand around with all the other cattle.

I love a good horror movie but this one falls horribly short.The first problem with this film is the ghost. Although the attempt is made to explain what is behind all of the ghost's anger it just isn't conceivable or interesting. Wouldn't someone who bought teeth for a living because her face was burned off rather just be dead than run around a town scaring little boys? This villain is only semi-scary in one scene at the end of the film when the scarred face is finally revealed. But the ghost spends the entire film cloaked in a tattered black cloth and a rip off of the "Scream" mask. I always thought ghosts lurked in places they had ties to; this one seems to be tied to homes, hospitals and even lighthouses, why? Maybe she should have tried the local dentist's office since she has an obsession with teeth!To complete the horror (ha, ha) of this movie is the ever present horror movie recipe: one hunky dude who saves the day in a tight sweaty shirt, one helpless girl in a tight tank top and a scared little kid, not to mention the countless inept policemen and hospitals that allow civilians in the surgery rooms! What I am trying to say is that none of this makes much sense and will have little impact as a horror movie on even the jumpiest of viewers.

I can't even count how many times I have seen this movie. Each time I watch it I cry for days. A visually beautiful film with a tragic story line that involves war, political conspiracy, a haunting love story and wonderful characters of great depth.This is one of my all time favorite films and top five love stories. It is breathtakingly beautiful and powerfully tragic at the same time. Worth every moment!!

I am constantly amazed at how French filmmakers are able to capture the essence of relationships within simple story lines. "The Housekeeper" is just one of those films.Jean-Pierre Bacri plays a middle aged man, living in Paris, who is recently alone. His apartment becomes dirty and his solution although quite innocent becomes very complex. Bacri hires a youthful housekeeper, played brilliantly by Emilie Dequenne, and the story begins. At first the two lost souls appear to be from two different worlds, one childlike and innocent against the other so very harsh and bitter. As life progresses the two characters interconnect in a deep way that on the surface appears simply to be one of those silly French affairs of the heart. The simplicity of this film is also its brilliance.Bacri allows his audience to see what a man feels during middle age; he conveys so much more than just a mid-life crisis. Through this actor's eyes we are able to find illusion, arrogance, and mindless sex turn into a life changing moment where the man left on the beach in the end is more than a simple shallow point. Against Bacri, Dequenne portrays her character with such nave innocence the audience wants to reach in and protect her. In the end her youth protects itself with renewal and endless hope."The Housekeeper" is a French masterpiece more than worthy of your time. It presents the commonality and the distances between the ages as well as between men and women. It is certainly not a romantic comedy filled with American fluff but more a beautiful human story filled with nuances and depth that gives your mind a chance to breathe. So leave the dusting and vacuuming for a few hours and delve into this extraordinary film in order to find a new sense of energy.

For a film with such worthy actors and an interesting storyline one would expect this movie to really be on fire...sadly its embers don't last very long.Denzel Washington plays an aging alcoholic body guard who finds a job protecting the child of a wealthy couple in Mexico. The young girl is played beautifully by Dakota Fanning who is the one breath of fresh air in this movie! Washington does his best to protect Fanning while becoming her unexpected mentor and friend along the way. The story has touching moments that could have lapsed into great ones had this film been directed by someone who cared about the outcome and not the quirky artsy movements of his camera lens instead. Despite all the "fire" this movie was supposed to contain it was hard to see its true meaning through all the smoke and awkward camera angles. If you like "who-dun-its" this one leaves little mystery; the culprit is obvious from the first few scenes.I found myself sorely disappointed in this movie because I had high expectations. The director Tony Scott has done excellent movies in the past but this one should have been left on the cutting room floor until he adapted his camera styles and strange moving sub-titles to a more traditional sequence. I found myself far too distracted by all the darkness and movement in the film when in reality the story itself would have sufficed. Scott never allowed Washington's mystery character to reveal himself; for instance the camera catches severe scarring on his hands many times in the movie but the viewer never finds out where they came from or why the scars were sometimes important. Dakota Fanning gets lost in this film as well. I felt her character would have had more impact had Scott allowed us to see what she was experiencing. It is a good film for action junkies but people who enjoy substance will walk away wondering what just happened to them and reaching for aspirin to correct the overactive camera damage to their eyes.

This French film is a depiction of infamous lovers, 19th century writers George Sand and Alfred de Musset.The storyline for this movie is based on a memoir written by Alfred de Musset after his notoriously bitter breakup with George Sand. Musset bordered on crazy and his passions became ignited by the independence of Sand, never one to cower before a man. Sand admits her passionate frustration toward Musset in her own memoirs written years later. They are the essence of the perfect couple until they drive one another insane; Musset with his arrogant talented laziness and ever roaming eye for sexual escapades and other outlets and Sand for her feminine machismo that defies the strongest of men during her era.I was disappointed with the casting of Juliette Binoche as George Sand in this movie because Sand was far from beautiful and even very often described as ugly, so why cast the exquisitely delicate and beautiful Binoche in this role? Binoche is perfect as the actress in this part she just doesn't capture the essence of George Sand. But if Sand is just another 19th century woman to you then you will never notice the difference and not be harmed by this miscasted role. Benoit Magimel, however, is the perfect actor to play the wildly mad Alfred de Musset. Magimel is the essence of childishness in this role, arrogant, spoiled by his talent and open to anything even to what will ultimately doom him in the end. Together Binoche and Magimel portray lovers with too much passion, that crazy kind that never works but always stays around to haunt you.I recommend reading about the controversial lives of these people, George Sand and Alfred de Musset, after watching this film for a better perspective on how they each affected one another's lives. Both figures were notorious in their day yet they contributed great works of art to our world and deserve their notoriety. As with all irresponsible behaviors and relationships they eventually move on to dust blown away in the wind. This movie is better than dust but the lives of Sand and Musset held better value once they were apart and as a historical record there are other avenues to pursue. As a film however this one is beautiful and sadly tragic at the same time well worth the childish behaviors.

Hayden Herrera has written an excellent portrait of the great artist Frida Kahlo, complete in thought and tender in describing a woman well lived.Frida Kahlo is the ultimate survivor and represents women for their strength, tenderness, fierceness and suffering compassion. She lived during a time when women had few rights, especially Mexican women, she faced the dreadfulness of the Mexican Revolution in her early years, a bout with polio, a horrible bus accident that attempted to cripple her for life, an often unfaithful husband, criticism of her dreams, activism, accused Communism and many exciting adventures in life. She lived a true artistic life and her paintings represent the complicated nature of her inner soul. She loved hard and fought often, for her rights, her dreams and her man. While bed-ridden and suffering in the severest of agony she taught herself to paint, her body encased in a huge white cast, she painted to survive and reached the other end with a unique perspective on art. Her life and home were surrounded with color, a rainbow that never needed the promise of something golden at the end. She danced her own rhythm and never stopped walking her own path. This is a woman to be admired!Herrera does an excellent job as the biographer of this phenomenally complicated woman. Her research is thorough and her suggestions entirely believable. You will be transported back in time into the life of a controversial woman who deserves every ounce of recognition that Herrera has given us.

For those of you who enjoy getting to know yourself this is a perfect book for you. It is filled with thought provoking questions and factual data. It takes awhile to complete and probably should be re-done every few years or so. This journal is a perfect gift to leave the world in your wake.

This movie is probably the most realistic film to date on war. Amazingly descriptive and hauntingly tragic it stays with you for days.Ridley Scott has made a phenomenal film depicting the true events of the American involvement in Somalia which lead to the downing of a Black Hawk helicopter. The opening images of Mogadishu give the impression of hell on earth. Emaciated Somalis walk about the desert with no hope, the dead are piled up and forgotten, nothing exists to base a life upon. Scott develops two ideas from these tragic opening scenes, one the heart-wrenching sorrow of the Somalian people and two of the necessity for American troop involvement. Scott has recreated Mogadishu as perfectly as Hollywood is capable of doing. You feel the heat and dirt clinging to your skin; you smell the burning weapons and dying flesh. He has accomplished an amazing feat without sacrificing the humanness of the situation.The Somalian people are portrayed as wild representations of human beings. They are bold and brave while at the same time being people of tremendous calculation and cooperation. Their markets are aisles of weapons and entire towns are prepared to fight and kill without question. The warlords are heartless choosing to control the population by starvation, drugs and death. Families are ripped apart, children become murdering soldiers, and thousands of people become living skeletons before they die. The soldiers are prepped with Quat, a cocaine like substance, and they soon become absolute killing machines with no mercy. Everyone is armed with AK47's and the decimated streets become killing fields. Nothing is sacred except the call to prayer, the Mosques being the only buildings that remain intact. It is unfathomable to imagine how someone survives under such circumstances.The American soldiers are portrayed by convincing actors like, Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard and most especially Eric Bana. They bond as a unit thrown into a war and used as pawns by Washington. They are noble, brave and proudly willing to fight a mission they soon lose control of. The people in charge of the mission misguide and misdirect one too many times losing touch with the violence that the soldiers face while on the ground in Mogadishu. The scenes depict the absolute chaos that takes over the well planned and sophisticated mission to capture the Somalian warlord, Aidid. It shows how war on paper and on video games is much different from reality. This film violently brings to life the horror of war. Bodies are blown apart, torsos severed in half, soldiers left behind to die and no answers in sight. Scott does a fantastic job of showing the pride of American patriotism while also convincing us of the suffering that the Somalian people have lived with.Unfortunately this film would have to be several hours longer to include all the background for the violence exhibited against the American soldiers. Watch documentaries and read books to get the full story behind "Black Hawk Down". Although it is horribly tragic to lose the lives of American soldiers, especially to have their bodies dragged and mutilated, it is also tragic to lose thousands of lives on the other side. This film will hit you with such force and open your eyes to the horrors of war. It takes hatred, rage and revenge to another level. It brings to the forefront how our world has changed; no longer can powerful sophisticated armies override poor countries as a granted privilege. Although you will scream with patriotism while watching this film you will also realize that humans are humans and blood flows the same regardless of who it comes from. I will be forever convinced that there must be a better way.

Tracy Chevalier has written a beautiful novel of Dutch life in the 1600's blended with the art of the renowned painter Vermeer.The story revolves around a young Dutch girl named Griet who is employed by a mistress and her husband (Vermeer) to work as a maid in their household. Griet comes from a poor family who struggles to survive after an accident takes the sight of her father and leaves him unable to provide for his family. As a young maid Griet tries to fit in with the large family and tangled webs they weave. She is fascinated by the art of Vermeer and becomes an unofficial assistant to the great man. But the story lies in the subtle nuances and splendid metaphors that Chevalier creates to guide her characters along. Through her beautiful writing you will fall in love with the period, the art and with young Griet.I recommend having a Vermeer art book near by as you read so that you can reference the many paintings as Chevalier leads you through their creation. Along with the assistance of her character Griet we are able to imagine how Vermeer used moments in time, the camera obscura and objects placed just so to create his art. All of the fiction could easily be something that actually occurred because little is known of Vermeer's life behind the scenes. Chevalier manages to paint her own masterpiece with this lovely novel. Once you begin to see life through Griet's eyes you won't be able to put it down and love will seem so harsh in our own time period as compared to the subtle innocence of the 1600's when a touch on the lips or a look into a sparkling eye would produce shockwaves of emotion. Find out how a little pearl earring can produce so much elegance yet hold the most complicated of truths.

The French certainly know how to film a sensuous romantic tale without an ounce of vulgarity. This film is a beautiful tribute about a young boy growing up with an obsession for hairdressers. It is often funny, sexy, and even sad but woven together masterfully into a striking film.Jean Rochefort plays the man who recounts his life story as it pertains to his love affair with women hairdressers. He begins the story developing a crush upon an older robust woman who cuts his hair. As a grown man he falls in love with a beautiful woman who holds a life of mystery but he marries her without question and never seems to see any faults within her. Rochefort represents either a man in complete and blinding love or an obsessive pervert depending on how you look at him. He is tender and loving but also pretty close to stalking material! His best scenes are also his funniest when he dances to Arabic music and tries to mesmerize little boys into getting their haircuts without fussing.The woman who plays the "hairdresser" is Anna Galiena, an absolute beauty who is seductive and troubled. She holds the town's men within her grasp but only loves Rochefort. The love scenes are extremely erotic without any nudity, something only the French are capable of filming it seems. Galiena never reveals her past or why she seems somehow desperately sad. She seems to cover up her emptiness through an anxious obsession with cutting hair and having sex with Rochefort. Her quiet complexities carry the film because the viewers continue to hope for something to be revealed about this private stunning woman.Although this film is exquisitely beautiful it is also frustrating because the characters never reveal their truths. It is easy to see why Rochefort would be passionate about Galiena but what drives Galiena to be interested in Rochefort? Possibly the filmmakers decided to let the viewers form their own opinions about each character. Regardless it is worth the effort but you may never look at hairdressers quite the same.

This is a simple yet complex French film about relationships and finding a faith that one can stick to.The incomparable Audrey Tautou stars in this lightly serious film and portrays a young model who is struggling with her faith, both in herself and with God. Her relationship with a man has ended and she suffers from a broken heart and a lost soul when she meets a handsome veterinarian (played by Edouard Baer) and begins the quest of falling back in love with something. She stars out a semi-Buddhist and upon meeting Baer feels the need to show him his Jewish roots, convincing him they should become a couple of practicing Jews, before they get married, by taking classes with a local Rabbi. It is an interesting look at how easily faith can be lost and found depending on one's self worth and life circumstances.This little film is fun to watch and has a very appealing content attached to it but I found myself irritated by the camera work, it jittered and moved around like a camcorder in the hands of an amateur. Audrey Tautou has that childlike grace that offers a camera such depth if it holds her in close-up for longer than a second but her beauty was lost in this project. Instead of being a deeply introspective character in search of something better than herself Tautou just races around flittering about in a camera lens unable to spotlight the message in this story. It could have been great with a little more focus!

I have watched several versions of this story and in my opinion the original version is still the best.This modern version is hyped up with sexy teenagers and definitely more obvious gore....like legs getting severed and bodies hung up like meat. Those aspects were also in the original but your mind was what presented the gore more than actual special effects.The actors are all pretty lame, stupid and witless. But who else would stay around in such a crazy town? The "chainsaw" family are all pretty disgusting, inbred and wicked. The scenery is trashy, dirty and littered with pieces of old dead bodies and rusty cars. Of course it is always dark and rainy, a must for bad horror films!The only thing that makes this film at all interesting is the way that the filmakers present clips at the beginning and end leading one to believe this story might actually have taken place in some small creepy town right in our own backyards. That in itself is enough to creep you out. Don't watch it alone but don't miss the original either.

I thought the concept behind this film was interesting so I watched it, only to be sadly dissapointed by the lack of effort behind a good idea.I believe 14th century France would be mortified at how it was portrayed in this film with just a bunch of cardboard boxes thrown together as scenery and badly sewn together costumes. Even the attempt at speaking French seemed somehow out of a French 101 class in high school! The battle scenes are puppetry at best and nothing close to what a good Shakespearean play would have slapped together. The script itself is just far too predictable for my taste.I hoped for more because like I said the idea behind this film is interesting. But next time I think I will spend my money on the book rather than a movie that has sadly run out of time.

This movie had a deeply profound affect on me, not my religious beliefs, not my historical knowledge, but on ME as a person. Despite all the rhetoric involved in the release, the promotion and the hype it clearly sends a message to humanity.....to suffer for your fellow man is the ultimate sacrifice but it will lead to the greatest of honor.This extraordinary film is the re-enactment of the passion as explained in the four books of the Gospel. It helps to read these books prior to the film if you are not familiar with the story or if you want to be able to compare and contrast Gibson's idea to the truth as told within the Bible. Most of the film is very dark but brings to light historical figures that lived in a time of horrible brutality. If crimes were punished in a similar way today I doubt we would have many criminals! Christ knows his direction in life and has willingly accepted his own death in order to save the sins of humanity. Whether or not you believe the religious theory behind this sacrifice the story represents what all humans should be willing to do for the life of another. This movie is absolutely brutal and so graphic that the faint at heart will have to turn away, but don't, the least we can do for this historical figure is watch a movie that depicts His suffering. As for the anti-Semitism that was so widely touted I didn't see it. To be honest with you I felt angrier at the Romans for the relentless beating they gave to Christ. But it isn't a class, gender or race issue that is involved in this story it is about humanity as a whole and how we resort to violence instead of acceptance towards the things we don't understand. All creeds, religions and sects have authorized brutal killings for the sake of their faith so no one is more able to wipe their hands of Christ's death than any other.James Caviezel plays the part of Jesus Christ with such perfection you will feel as though you have been transported back in time and are actually meeting the image of the man Himself. This role required a great deal from Caviezel, demanding endurance and exhibiting compassion without going overboard as so many other actors have done in the past. The film is spoken in Aramaic and Latin (with sub-titles) and Caviezel is flawless in his accent bringing even more depth to his portrayal. By the end of this movie the only thing that can move on Caviezel is his eyes and in those last subtle shifts of movement his acting becomes something phenomenal. Beside Caviezel in her role as Mary Magdalene is Monica Bellucci whose loyalty and soft determination follows Christ to His grave along with Mother Mary (played by Maia Morgenstern). The women are the strength of this film just as I imagine them to have been in real life although they were ostracized by the men who wrote the Bible. Rosalinda Celentano is the ever present Satan that horrible evil that lurks in every nook and cranny of this film and she is downright scary. Caiphas is presented as a vindictive man and is played nicely by Mattia Sbragia. Close to Caviezel in excellence is Hristo Shopov cast as the powerful but weak Pontius Pilate. The truly amazing thing is that none of the actors in this film are really "stars" but they all succeed in their roles with a grace and spirit that stands above the fluff and muster of Hollywood.Mel Gibson has done something here that surpasses bravery, he has taken a highly controversial subject (religion and faith), stayed very close to the story as told in the Gospels and dared to put his own funding up to support it, so is he crazy or was he driven to bring a taste of faith back into a hollow humanity. Not only is this film beautiful to watch but it is as accurate a story as can be told based upon historical and religious records. The music is haunting and magical. The use of foreign language a feat in its own right for American audiences who would rather eat popcorn than read subtitles. But Gibson's real gift is how he manages to inspire something in people who see this film, it may be tears, compassion, renewed faith, anger, spite or indifference but at least it stirs up something in a massive audience of people who all too often don't have to feel anything while watching a film. If you don't walk away from this film feeling changed inside and willing to see Christ as a human being who loved more than himself then the sadness rests with you.

This movie is amazing in many ways offering a showcase for the writing talent of Michael Cunningham (the writer of the original novel) as well as providing a solution for all of the lonely families that exist in the world today...make your own.As a young boy Bobby Morrow (Andrew Chalmers) is exposed to the magical world of his older spaced-out brother and he learns that happiness can be found in the simplest of experiences. However a freak accident takes the brother's life and Bobby is left to mature in a world not always so welcoming. As a teenager Bobby (Erik Smith) befriends another boy, Jonathan Glover (Harris Allan), and they experiment with weed and sex forging a friendship/relationship that lasts for a lifetime. Bobby finds a new family in Jonathan's after his own mother and father eventually pass away. Lost and alone Bobby retains his innocence and openness managing to capture the admiration of everyone he encounters it seems. One of his strongest relationships happens with Mrs. Glover (Sissy Spacek) Jonathan's mother who teaches him to bake and provides him a direction in life. As an adult Bobby (Colin Farrell) works in a bakery and lives with the Glovers until they move to Arizona. This prompts Bobby to move to New York to live with Jonathan (Dallas Roberts) and his kooky artistic roommate/girlfriend Clare (Robin Wright Penn). From this crazy situation a family forms, crossing barriers and fine lines in order to incorporate the needs of three misunderstood and lonely people.I can't say enough about how beautiful the message in the movie is. It is both complicated and simple in theory resulting in something incredibly profound. The question is raised about the rights and wrongs of relationships and how society perceives them finally offering a solution that can only be accepted by someone who has evolved beyond believing that society's norms are the only answer. Isn't it more important to experience true unconditional love rather than what most families pretend to feel in order to appear "normal"? The acting in this film is extraordinary with Colin Farrell showing his true gifts to tremendous ability and playing the infectious Bobby to perfection. Robin Wright Penn is brilliant as always along with Dallas Roberts. And of course Sissy Spacek is seen here in an extraordinary light as a mother who cares more about her family than her own image. It is impossible to walk away from this film with a hardened heart and for anyone who has ever felt the stork dropped them on the wrong doorstep this movie inspires hope and shows that a family can form from the most surprising circumstances if you open up your heart and allow it to find a real home.

Now the monsters are in our computers.....when will it ever stop?This dark and confusing film is directed by William Malone, someone notorious for filming with strange lighting and alternate worlds from what normal human beings reside within. This entire film is in the dark and that includes the storyline. Viewers are asked to believe that a website that features murder, mutilations and abuse can infect their brains via the internet.....just not very plausible! But as horror films go we must believe so that we can be scarred to death, which is exactly what happens to the victims of this film. Each person who logs onto the horrible website dies in 48 hours of what they fear most in the world. Unfortunately the story does not explain itself until the very end when it is all supposed to make sense. It would have been a better film had the story been part of the movie before the ending.Acting in this movie are Stephen Dorff, as a moody detective, and Natascha McElhorne, as a health inspector. Together these two people solve the internet "virus" while also getting sucked into the game. Stephen Rea is also seen as a creepy doctor and manages to be the only one with any clout. The acting is alright but I feel the actors suffer from the material they were given to work with. This film may appeal to "techies," all those overly educated souls who might be able to conjure up something as remote as the concepts portrayed in this film, but for the average internet surfer we have nothing to fear....including this movie!

It's a little bit Faulknerish but stakes its claim with McCullers either way this film is a love song to the South enriched by the great city of New Orleans.Who exactly is Bobby Long (John Travolta), a college literary professor, a master of prose, a lover or just a rotting loser? The explanation begins with the death of a matriarch named Lorraine who during her hard lived life enchanted a wealth of misfit men. Lorraine is the mother of estranged daughter, Pursy (Scarlett Johansson) who shows up to claim her portion of a dilapidated house with similar inhabitants. Pursy finds herself a roommate to both Bobby and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, writer Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht). The relationship is strained to say the least between the lost young woman and the two un-ambitious lugs that she waits hand and foot on without knowing exactly why. Stories about Lorraine emerge through bar-hopping oral histories and memories spewed forth between alcoholic fogs. But through a somewhat restless process all of the mysteries fall into place and become familiar.This film is so pretty to watch filled with colorful characters and scenery against the artistic backdrop of New Orleans, the city becomes a character within itself. You can feel the heat as the characters struggle to find their way but there is almost always something beautiful to capture your eye. Scarlett Johansson is wonderful as the confused young woman who searches for answers about herself and her family. She haunts the screen with her luminous innocence and captures the character with perfect honesty. Travolta seems mis-cast at first as the aged and ailing Bobby Long but once he begins to spout the legendary prose of Eliot, Frost and all the others he captures the true essence of Bobby Long. Lurking quietly behind Travolta and Johansson is Gabriel Macht, as the talented yet sluggish Lawson Pines. With beautiful bits of music to add charm to an already stunning film the viewer is drawn directly into a long lazy Southern summer in New Orleans searching for answers beside the wonderful characters. So it is apropos that a love song emerges to explain it all.

I have heard of &quot;The Alchemist&quot; for years but I suppose I wasn't ready for its message until recently.I honestly feel this book should be required reading for all people. Coelho has an amazing way of writing fiction with a theory about reality, and it works. He gives us the tale of a young boy disenchanted with his life who decides he must search the world for an answer to the hole in his heart. We are taken on a journey from Spain to Egypt with young Santaigo. Along the way we, like Santaigo, keep thinking that we have found life's answers but in the end we discover we had the answers all along. This is a profound discovery for some and a comforting redirection for others.Paulo Coehlo writes with such a depth that I found myself taking quotes on almost every page for future inspiration on how to run my life. With all of the global issues taking place in the world today I was floored by the following quote, &quot;No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he dosen't know it.&quot; In one paragraph Coehlo offers the answer. If we all felt so important we wouldn't need unnecessary attention would we? And maybe, just maybe the world would start to change.The most important message to take from this wonderful time honored tale is this, &quot;Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.&quot; Enough said!

Bravo to the filmakers for making this movie based on the plights of many war torn countries in Africa. This film exposes some of the atrocities faced by Africans, genocide, rape, torture, mass graves and the list only grows. A very necessary exposure for the world as it sits back and watches a great nation destroyed.The direction is excellent, war scenes mixed with touches of humanity and nature giving a sense of what people are fighting over. Some of the acting is a bit overdone, but then what other reason is there to watch a Bruce Willis movie? The most touching scenes are unfortunately the most brutal, the slaughter of towns, the piles of dead bodies, innocents pleading for life and the factual account of women being raped by militias who "de-breast" them so that future generations are deprived of something as simple as a mother's milk.I highly recommend this film for the horror it provokes and try to imagine the nations of Africa pleading for their lives while our fat and happy nation only fights for oil. Shouldn't war be about saving lives? This movie says it all....the right way.

This classic Halloween tale has been taken to new scare tactics by the fantastic imagination of director Tim Burton....don't expect a cute and comical kiddie film here!In a little spooky town called Sleepy Hollow a haunting occurs and people are losing their heads over it, literally! To the rescue arrives a less than nerdy Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) a forensic scientist with a bag filled with strange and revealing gadgets. Crane isn't the goofy, inept comedian from the original tale but some of the original characteristics remain in Depp like squeamishness and a bit of trembling fear. Sadly Crane lacks the efforts of his gangly foolish horse in this more serious version as well. But the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) is terrifying and his horse a bold and angry beast both pouncing through the screen with a vengeance. The heroine Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is wise in her own regard having a few ancient tricks up her sleeve to aid Crane with his fight against the evil haunting in Sleepy Hollow.Depp and Ricci are always great together and especially when paired with the amazing mind of Burton and the set creations he manages to conjure up in all of his pictures. Some of the be-heading scenes are rather gruesome especially in light of what our world has become since the making of this movie. The special effects are really astounding and the world of Sleepy Hollow (created in a film studio) is spookily enchanting just as a fairy tale should exist within. As with all of Burton's films between the darkness there exists a sense of comical wonder that creeps between the edges of fear. This is a great Halloween movie but I wouldn't watch it until the young ones are asleep because it is penetrating enough to cause a few nightmares worth waking up from.

As a Thoroughbred owner I have been facinated by the racing world and all of its stars from Man O' War to our newest star Smarty Jones. But I have to say Ruffian is my all time sentimental favorite.I can remember watching the match race between Ruffian and the colt Foolish Pleasure. It was a time for women's lib and Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs. I always wanted the girls to win!! But tragically Ruffian paid the price in front of our own eyes. I can remember crying for weeks after watching her beautiful black body fall. My heart was broken for years!This book is truly a magnificent tribute to one of racing's greatest heros, a big black filly named Ruffian. It reads much more emotionally than other tribute books currently on the market and will stay with you for years. Reading about Ruffian's will to keep running even with two broken legs will rip your heart out! Make sure you buy some stock in Kleenex before you begin this emotional memoir.

I watched this film because one of my favorite rides of all time is Disney's &quot;Haunted Mansion.&quot; I have to say the only reason I really enjoyed this film was for the special effects and memories of all those old spooky ghosts from the original ride at Disneyland.Eddie Murphy plays an overly ambitious real estate agent who ends up at the mansion with his family trying to strike up a deal with a few ghosts. The story is horribly hokey! The acting is silly and filled with typical Murphy antics: silly laughing and funny smiles.The best part of this movie is the special effects and the graveyard scenes. I found the movie to be a bit scary for children as some of the zombies are very &quot;real&quot; looking. For adults it is an evening of silly fun but sadly for young children they might spend their evening with nightmares instead of giggles!

This movie is worth watching if you have a few hours to spare but don't fall over yourself to catch it.The story is supposed to be a funny romantic comedy but it is only partially that at best. It begins with a bachelor party and a would-be-groom waking up next to a hula dancer at the same time that his fianc&eacute; is coming over. How many times has this story been told? From here it only gets more and more predictable, the dancer is part of the fianc&eacute;'s family, the parents of the couple are opposites (one rich, the other poor), crazy friends fall about complicating things and it all gets very confusing if it hadn't ever been done before. The movie is filled with lewd jokes that are grosser than they are funny, like crotch-itching, dirty underwear and a spell with the runs. There are just too many other movies that work and are held together by the same concepts with better stars and better writing.Julia Stiles plays the dancer and I was disappointed in her comedic ability, she is such a good serious actress I could never figure out why she chose this role. The doomed groom is played by Jason Lee who falls far short of the great leading man category. Selma Blair works as the worried fianc&eacute; but her role is really boring. A few others add a bit of whimsy to the cast but nothing significant.I would recommend spending your time and money on "Meet the Parents" or "My Best Friend's Wedding" if you are looking for really funny wedding films. Otherwise this will do if you have no imagination and expect less than the best from romantic comedies, it certainly isn't this girl's thing!

I have recently become facinated by all things French and unfortunately the Marquis De Sade just happens to be French.So I dared to watch this movie because I had only heard about how horrible De Sade was but never ventured out on my own to really see what he was all about. For a first encounter this movie is probably pretty tame, it hints at abuse, beatings and sexual perversion but dosen't actually show anything worse than the average R rated movie these days.Geoffrey Rush plays Marquise De Sade with perfection....what other actor could play a pale, ugly, pervert with such conviction. He will give you the creeps when he attempts his seduction on Kate Winslet, the hairs on my neck CRAWLED. He convinces with a sincere eeriness as he spends the film writing his shocking stories with everything from ink, to blood, to his own waste. I suppose some will admire his tenacity to his art....I just found it insane. Kate Winslet plays the role of a virginal chamber maid who relays Sade's stories out of the asylum and onto the French masses. Joaquin Phoenix as usual plays someone who begins with morals and ends up being a freak. He is also an actor who can deceive convincingly. Michael Caine is the aged doctor who arrives at the aslyum to try and stop Sade's writing. He marries a very young girl and shows his own sexual perversions along the way. Another creep! The other actors who play the insane members of the asylum are fantastic and entirely believable. A great production on an awful subject and it will leave you sneering!

Pearl S. Buck delivers a brilliantly written novel about life during pre-revolutionary China capturing all of the harshness and splendor of this well deserving country.Wang-Lung begins life as a poor farmer struggling to make his way in the world. He spends his days toiling in an infertile field until he finds his wife O-lan. O-lan works as a servant in a rich family's home so she carries within herself a work ethic and many valuable clues on how to prosper. She agrees to be taken away by Wang-Lung and marries him without knowing where this decision will eventually take her. Intermingled within the tale of Wang-Lung, O-lan and the earth are children still to arrive, relatives who need taking care of and the rise and fall of wealth during a developing China. The story is about struggle, success and the inevitable despair of too much wealth and not enough value. Much of this story's importance lies within the suggestion of beauty and whether true exquisiteness is found in a youthful, naive girl with porcelain skin and bound feet or whether age, wisdom and a hard-working nature represents the idea more truthfully, for does true beauty lie only in the physical or is it held deeper within?Pearl S. Buck writes with a wonderful flow making this seemingly simple tale into something hauntingly beautiful. She touches upon the contradictions of Chinese society in its pre-revolutionary time, beauty and wealth is awarded while workers struggling to survive are often left to die in the very earth they toil. The price of a woman's beauty is brought forth delicately here with references to brothels, the horribleness of foot binding and the useless throwing away of female babies. Buck brings her readers deep into the earth of China and she allows us to suffer and emote right beside her characters. Wang-Lung will bring you a range of emotion including grating disappointment, O-lan provides a grounding strength that perseveres throughout this saga, Lotus Flower offers calculated opportunity and becomes the fear of all married women. Buck's characters carry depth and possess such heart that they will stay with you for days on end. But the real grounding force here is the earth that loamy fertile soil that provides for us all but can always take what it gives away with such tremendous force.

This film might bring back a little spring to your step while appealing to that sense of adventure we all stuff away as we get older.The story was originally a novel by the great Tennessee Williams and it contains all of the tragic passion that Williams became a master of putting into words. Mrs. Stone is played by Helen Mirren as the ever tragic but beautiful lady aging in grace. With a career that begins to betray her, Mrs. Stone, travels to Italy with her stable but not very vigorous husband (Brian Dennehy) and falls in love with her surroundings. Tragically her ailing husband passes away and Mrs. Stone is left to contemplate her future as an aging widow with an ache for life and love. She returns to Italy only to be seduced by such beautiful evil due to her vulnerability. Anne Bancroft is exceptional as a countess (really a poor madam) who "befriends" Mrs. Stone. Eventually Mrs. Stone finds a new life, so she thinks, in the seduction of youth as found in a gorgeous gigolo (Olivier Martinez).Helen Mirren is wonderful in this role as an aging but still absolutely vibrant widow. She makes the aging process look tireless and inspires a mature but youthful look at the world. Anne Bancroft is cunning and calculated as the Italian madam looking out for her own interests. What can anyone say about the extraordinary beauty of Olivier Martinez cast perfectly in his role as every rich and lonely woman's nightmare? Tennessee Williams has created a brilliant look into the brutal act of trying to age gracefully showing how the vulnerability of vanity can lead towards a horrible season. The backdrop of Italy adds a flavor that only encourages the characters into unknown passions. This film will leave you wondering if narcissism or maturity will rule in the rites of a glorious Italian spring.

If you enjoy movies with complex characters and a simple yet tricky plot this film will probably appeal to you because it is filled with great actors and a wonderfully intricate storyline as well as offering up a world of thorny possibilities.The story takes place during the 1940's when influential people were held to extraordinary standards and morality meant much more than it does today. Society upheld Arthur Barret (William Hurt) and his beautiful wife Eleanor (Madeleine Stowe) but underneath their social relationship lurked a barrenness, literally. Arthur makes the choice to hire another man to impregnate his wife because of his own inability to do so. But what begins as a secret and interesting choice soon gets blown into another dimension once real feelings are mixed up between all of the parties involved. The young man employed as a stud, Roger Martin (Neil Patrick Harris), becomes enamored with Mrs. Barret and threatens to expose the couple to their society crowd. Lurking behind the scenes is housekeeper and busybody Syril Danning (Blythe Danner) who along with her employer put an end to the scandal. But all is not what it seems.The actors are all very good in this film with the standouts being William Hurt, Madeleine Stowe and Neil Patrick Harris. Of course Kenneth Branagh is wonderful in his brief role here as well and Blythe Danner and Robert Loggia offer perfect supporting roles. It is a complicated story that leaves you wondering what you would have done in the same predicament especially during the 40's when everything seemed morally questionable. With all the availability for childbirth in this era it is hard to fathom how the problem of barrenness was dealt with in earlier times. Either way when a third party enters the realm of a marriage the proof comes out in the pudding or in the proposition.

I would have never read this book had it not been for the advice from someone I admire greatly. It was highly recommended as a spiritual experience....so I tried it.With all of the emphasis placed on religion today I found this book to inspire not religious practice but true inner peace and spiritual values comparable to many religious texts. This book has something to say and if you get it the message will follow you forever, yes it has that much impact on an open heart.The story revolves around an Indian youth named Siddhartha, who with a restless heart and many questions attempts to experience the world before making a commitment to tradition. He struggles with the ties of family values and the pull of an unknown world. So he takes a plunge and leaves his security nest to find what life is all about. He works, he strives, he succeeds, he finds wealth, love and humanity but in the end all he really needs is peace of mind and freedom to choose his own path. Sounds achingly familiar to us all dosen't it?I highly recommend you experience this book, for the beauty, the bravery and the freedom of choice. It will remain a part of your soul if you let it!

After returning from a trip to Paris I decided to read this memoir by Hemingway because I heard he loved Paris as much as I. I have to say I imagined a beautifully descriptive book filled with telling prose and wonderful scenes of Paris. I love the way Hemingway writes but this book disappointed me. It may be that it was published after his death and slapped together without his perfectionistic control."A Moveable Feast" is an interesting read, simple even. If you know Paris you can even walk with Hemmingway along the Rues and conjure up a few old cafes that are still in business. If you are a writer it is nice to imagine yourself as the poor and struggling Hemmingway bent on a dream. But the stories are really nothing more than gossip about other writers and reknown figures such as, Fitzgerald, Stein, James, Pound and others flocking through Paris in the 1920's. I was hoping for more. The only paragraph I paid much attention to because of its "Hemingway" quality read like this, "They say the seeds of what we will do are in all of us, but it seemed to me that in those who make jokes in life the seeds are covered with better soil and with a higher grade of manure." Gems like this can be found but unfortuneately not often. Paris and Hemingway are both such profound enigmas that I expected a gourmet feast not just a trip to Denny's!

Between the spooky writing of Stephen King and the eerie direction of Stanley Kubrick it is hard to tell who made this movie scarier but it is a must for horror fans.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer in search of a quiet place to sit down and finish his novel so he interviews for a winter solstice as a caretaker for a remote resort in the Colorado mountains. In tow is his fragile wife (Shelley Duvall) and susceptible son (Danny Lloyd). The resort is filled with old haunted tales and legends so it becomes inevitable that something will be lurking behind those scary bushes! Jack settles into life as a writer but soon suffers from a bout of writer's block or is it something else? His frustration shows up in irritated bouts of abuse directed towards his family. His wife, Wendy, seems to slip lower and lower on the totem pole and becomes a shell of her former self as she tries her best to avoid angering her volatile husband with wicked eyebrows and an ever present smirk on his face. Meanwhile their son, Danny, spins about the hotel on a bigwheel and discovers all sorts of little secrets lurking in the rooms, a pair of spooky twin ghosts, blood soaked walls and a maze of manicured shrubs. Redrum, redrum.....beware!!There is always something unsettling about Stanley Kubrick's pictures and this film is pretty creepy. I must admit I never read Stephen King's novel but it is my understanding that Kubrick took it upon himself to change a few things resulting in a riff between the two artists. Regardless this film will remain a classic thriller despite succumbing to a recent remake. Jack Nicholson is downright terrifying in this film and Shelley Duvall becomes his squealing victim. Pulling some fantastic creepy performances out of nowhere are the young Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers who both manage to add a few eerie scenes to their bag of tricks. You will definitely want to leave the lights on while watching this movie and hope they keep shining bright well past bedtime!

This movie is both great and awful depending entirely upon one's need for accuracy or how deeply you may have felt about the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald.Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for this film and followed the classic book about as closely as a film is capable of doing. But I found the direction to be flawed somehow. The film is filled with starlit close-ups (no one's eyes sparkle like that, not even Daisy's) and smoke screen silhouettes, complex party scenes and plenty of flapper costumes. I just couldn't figure out why all of the strange lighting existed after hiring two nearly perfect looking actors, in Mia Farrow and Robert Redford. I would have preferred to see the stars in Daisy's eyes stem from a great acting performance rather than the eerie sparkles falsely placed in every close-up!Robert Redford was good as Gatsby and he conveyed some of the character's desperate and lonely love. I was disappointed that all of the complexity of Gatsby was never fully explained. If I would not have known the story beforehand I would have never understood what tied Gatsby and Daisy together, other than money of course. But Redford captures Gatsby's aloofness to a tee and one can easily see why Daisy would be in love with Gatsby.I found Mia Farrow to be disappointing as Daisy Buchanan, the spoiled debutante who manages to seduce the great Gatsby for a lifetime. As stated previously Farrow's close-ups were far too crafted to seduce anyone. She came across as a flirty silly girl more than a classic seductress and paled in comparison to Redford's portrayal of Gatsby. She looked cute in all of the frilly costumes of course, but I never really found her character believable.Karen Black is downright scary as the mistress of Mr. Buchanan, with her eyes crossing and spitting with every close-up. Bruce Dern plays the arrogant competitive Mr. Buchanan with great nastiness. Sam Waterston steals the show however with his portrayal as the narrator of the story. He captures innocence and compassion while keeping his open-eyed curiosity and faithfulness to Gatsby from beginning to end.Overall this film is good, if you have read the book first, but lacks a full explanation. The filmmakers relied more on scenery and lighting than perfect casting and a deeper meaning. Some scenes are magical while others fall flat. For Redford fans and lovers of the 20's it is a gem. The greed and power hungry people are captured but sadly the deepest desires of all that passion become lost behind the filmmakers vision.

Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are two people destined to end up as one in this funny and romantic comedy.At times Kate Hudson comes across as enchanting as her mother, Goldie Hawn, her smile is absolutely contagious. Her character is a magazine writer who finds herself stuck with the writing assignment of losing a man through all the typical dating &quot;dont's&quot; that women fall into. She is engagingly funny as she talks baby talk, brings over a suitcase full of stuffed animals and carries around a silly toy dog during her 1 week relationship. But despite all her clingy, controlling stupidity she still gets the guy because it is a movie after all.Matthew McConaughey is his usual gorgeous self playing an ad exec who tries to bag a deal by making a woman fall in love with him, instead of the diamonds in his ad. I imagine this would not be too hard....but the movie makes it out to be. It is one of those romantic play-hard-to-get tales and it works in its own simple way.So watch it with the girls or on a night spent all alone and hope the man of your dreams looks like Matthew McConaughey, just don't lose him!

Although the premise of this movie is far fetched it works because of its sweetness and fantasy.Jennifer Garner plays a woman who gets transported from her 13 year old birthday party straight into her 30's, by passing all the joys of childhood and puberty she finds that she has turned into a horrible grown-up in more ways than one. Garner is pure innocence and absolutely infectious in this silly role that few actresses could have pulled off so well. As a modern woman sophisticated enough to be an editor for a fashion magazine in New York she fumbles about as the transported child/woman and causes quite a havoc in her childish wake. The pranks and gags are funny especially the constant references to that great old era "the 80's", completed by the "Thriller" dance remake that will have you dancing or laughing or both!Mark Ruffalo is cast as the love interest for Garner. As her childhood best friend he has become lost in the shuffle of Garner climbing to the top and he gets lost far behind. But as the child/woman Garner finds all that she missed along the way and the puppy love begins. Ruffalo is a great guy, not too macho and not too pretty so he manages to come across perfectly as the best friend that waits patiently in the wings and he is adorable.This movie works for adults as well as teenagers and is a pleasant film to watch. If you know the 80's it is filled with funny nostalgia and great music. If you skipped your childhood bent on success this film will encourage you to find that playfulness and inventiveness that so many adults lack. Colorful and fun this movie ROCKS with plenty of magic dust to take us all back a few years to the land of enjoyment.

A picture filmed beautifully and full of dilemmas. Originally a book by Graham Greene, this story is compelling from simple beginning to bitter end.Michael Caine plays an English reporter in 1950's Vietnam. Caine is brilliant in this role and has moments of complete vulnerability. He lives with a young Vietnamese woman named Phuong (played by actress Do Thi Hai Yen) and uses her as his cushion while ignoring his wife. At some point in the film the question arises on whether or not Caine's character is in love with Phuong or merely holding her as a possession. This dilemma complicates the role of Phuong as well, why would a beautiful young woman spend her time with such an old coot? It turns out that love is only about money and status in 1950's Vietnam. Both characters become interesting backed by this complication and the way they use one another understandable to some extent but also sad.An innocent American, played by Brendan Fraser, appears on the scene and befriends the English reporter and claims to fall in love with Phuong. He carries on a friendship with Caine's character while hunting his mistress behind his back. It seems creepy and sly but if he really loves the woman wouldn't it be a better situation for Phuong? Yet another dilemma to ponder during this complicated film. Fraser is excellent as the conniving American with a few tricks up his sleeve revealed slowly through a series of dangerous situations.Caine and Fraser play brilliantly off one another in this film with both actors stepping out of their normal safety zones. The film will leave you wondering how justified the Americans were in their involvement in the Vietnam war.....if it started wrong why shouldn't it end wrong? The ending of the film is something to contemplate begging a decision between right and wrong where violence is concerned. In a country where people and politics are merely tools it is hard to make such choices and right and wrong becomes frayed at the edges. Pay attention to the quiet one he may have something important to say!

This sountrack by Hans Zimmer is terrific. I don't believe you can watch the film and not leave the theater without the music in your head. Ethnic, violent, hanunting and tragic all at the same time it continues to bring to life the tragedy of the film with each listen. A powerful ride and well worth the purchase!

This epic film is the first in a trilogy of Civil War re-enactments and tells the story of events that took place in Virginia and West Virginia during 1861-1863.I was very impressed with this film and the seeming accuracy with which the filmmakers stayed true. While I am shamefully unaware of all of the complex history that took place during the Civil War I imagine most of this film to be a just depiction of the history books. The film is very long and almost impossible to get through in one sitting unless you are a Civil War fanatic. Many of the scenes are devastating and bring to life the horrible reality of what real war was all about. These men, and sadly many boys, went to battle with nothing more than their own feet, woolen coats for armor and felt hats as helmets with their hearts as their only shield. Just watching the effort it took to fire one shot and then to re-load and hope to not get hit by fire in return was shear torture to observe. Life is just much easier all the way around for Americans these days. This film is powerful, inspiring and extremely sad all at the same time. But it is after all how America came to be and shows the integrity with which our Nation was created.While I found myself being disappointed at times with the endless stream of unknown actors who graced the screen and the often comical mis-glued beard, I did enjoy a few of the noted performances. The always brilliant Robert Duvall portrays Gen. Robert E. Lee with a quiet extremely conservative conviction. Duvall masters dignity in this role and enforces the greatness of Gen. Lee. Beside Duvall, portraying the great "Stonewall" Jackson is Stephen Lang. Lang is absolutely superb as Jackson and showed him to be a faithful servant of the Confederate campaign. Lang has touching scenes with a young child he befriends on Xmas day and during his breakdown on the field once he learns of her demise. I have to say that for the majority of this film I was rooting for the Southern Confederates because of their extreme integrity and awesome faith in something higher than themselves, but then I remembered my history lessons and realized they were for slavery ( an idea I abhor!) so I switched sides....yes, I flip-flopped!!This movie is epic in proportion using a cast of thousands of extras to fight in the battle scenes. My only complaint is that sometimes some of the scenery and little details come across a little on the cheesy side but then it would be impossible to be perfect on such an extraordinary historical set with so many people to tend to. I felt as though the film was pretty one-sided with the emphasis on integrity and faith resting with the South and the Northerners being the sneaky, stealing side resting their laurels on the faith of old Roman soldiers rather than a true God. Slavery had to end for democracy to continue so all of the good ole Southern faith and glory couldn't be as wonderful as this film tends to portray. But an important aside stems from such a film, it makes you want to learn more about American history and how we came to be. It seems a country built from such hardship, strength and honor would remain planted in roots sown so bravely but divided we begin to stand once again. Hopefully our new generals find faith in some of what the old ones left behind, not in history books but in every American heart.

This film made in 1978 is a behind the scenes look at the world of professional football that remains sadly pertinent to the NFL today making the meshing of the business world and athletes a sport of its own.Nick Nolte plays an aging and aching receiver who has the heart to play the game of football but lacks the ability to have his mind controlled by the people who run the game. Nolte is excellent as he winches and moans throughout the film waiting for his chance to play but being continuously undermined by a corrupt coaching staff and the owners of his team. Mack Davis plays the handsome Texan quarterback who cares little about the mind control and more about having a good time. Charles Durning is the Maalox drinking assistant coach who adds some comedic relief to the story, along with Bo Svenson who plays a psychotic linebacker with nothing but "kill" in his heart. Dabney Coleman and Steve Forest are the evil business brothers who treat their players like machines tossing them out whenever necessary without a thought. Finally G.D. Spradlin does an excellent job as the head coach without much of a soul but with plenty of insight.The story shows a world filled with parties, adultery, corruption and drugs as it engulfs the football players searching to fulfill their dreams of stardom and self-importance. One hit can end it all and one badly placed step can change their world. In order to succeed and have a long career in the game drugs are used to keep the aging body going. While on the outside a toke of marijuana ends the game (shades of Ricky Williams here!). Somehow it just doesn't make any sense. The film is a great classic if you love football but the actual game scenes are high school football at best. And politics......aren't they everywhere? Watch for the stirring speech from an athlete's heart delivered by the late great John Matuszak.

Camille Claudel was an amazing Parisian sculptress who lived far before time was good to her and this biography does her justice...finally!Born in 1864, Camille Claudel grew up with an ambition un-worthy of her sexual status. She held within her being an artistic fire that was only extinguished by supposed madness. I have the feeling that had this woman been alive today her art and her spirit would thrive. But during the 19th century women were still meant to be barefoot and pregnant with no ambition other than being a wife and mother. Claudel struggled to represent her art and her spirit was destroyed by those she loved the most. She fought against a mother who wanted to keep her quiet and reserved, she defied her brother's idealistic religious beliefs and she competed against the world renowned artiste, Auguste Rodin. Despite the odds against her she created many works of pure and exquisite beauty proving that women could surpass men if given a chance. But because of her spirited talent she was eventually relegated to a hospital for the insane due to her inability to deal with the pressures of a love not returned (with Rodin), financial ruin and a lack of respect for her hard honed works.Camille Claudel captured the struggles of love, aging and sexism in her famous sculptures: Jeune Fille a la Gerbe (1887), Giganti (1886), Vertumme et Pomone (1905), La Valse (1905), Clotho (1893), L'Implorante (1894-1905) and the magnificent L'Age mur (1902). Her abilities were innate but fine tuned through her affiliation with Auguste Rodin. In this relationship Camille flourished at first, guided under the wing of a master (24 years her senior), but she soon succumbed to his jealous competitiveness and his inability to commit fully to her love. Comparing the two sculptors one finds Claudel to be the true master because she refines lines that Rodin tends to leave unbalanced. Their competitive natures are apparent in the similarities of ideas but in my opinion Claudel outshines her "mentor." Claudel created sculptures from many mediums some plaster, some clay, many marble and even onyx, jade and bronze as well as dabbling in other art forms such as charcoals and portrait paintings. Many of Claudel's best works remain lost due to her internment and her loss of ability to control her own work. She also destroyed many of her own pieces in her angry despair believing them to be under jeopardy of being stolen by "Rodin and his gang." Thankfully the art world has managed to retain most of her great pieces and they currently reside in (of all places) the Rodin Museum in Paris.This biography is a wonderful read being both interesting and factual and additionally very well written by Odile Ayral-Clause. Camille Claudel lived a tragic life full of ups and downs eventually ending in complete despair. Her life is interesting because she was one of the forerunners for women's rights in that she refused to be dominated by male society and ferociously attacked anyone who attempted to destroy her dreams, unfortunately in 19th century Paris her actions labeled her insane, remember a woman who chose to wear pants was considered a criminal unless they obtained special permission from the police to do so and it was a popular thought at the time that talented women possessed genitalia very similar to men! I think society was more insane than Miss Claudel and I will forever wonder what she could have contributed had she been born in this century. The ending of this woman's tale is heartbreaking in itself but every page in between provides an eye-opening experience of what it must have been like to be an artistic woman during an age controlled by men.

I purchased &quot;Without Reservations&quot; after returning home from a quick trip to Europe. You see I had left my heart there and I needed a quick fix while pining away at home waiting for yet another friend to venture out and dare get a passport.Alice Steinbach writes with a capturing style about her adventures abroad (England, Paris, Italy etc..) all alone. For once a woman who believes in experience over fear! She is a mother, divorced, successful and still desiring a fulfilling life. I admire her spirit and enthusiasm for life. While capturing her inner fears she relies on her wit and knowledge to overcome what would leave most of us sitting at home cowering in a corner.Ms. Steinbach meets interesting people along the way, a fashionable older woman in Paris, a Japanese man who shares her love of Monet, a young student eager to grow and many others. She inspires one to want to reach out and learn something from the others around us, not for gossip, but for true wealth of character. I believe after reading this book I will no longer seek the security of familar travel partners but instead search for a lesser known commodity, me, a suitcase, a destination and a dream! Sounds exciting to me!

This is the second book I have read by Joanne Harris and although it is different from the first I still enjoyed the experience and highly recommend the journey.The story is fairly predictable, a frustrated writer escapes to France and finds himself drawn to a beautiful but reclusive neighbor. Yes, typical romance.....but alas so much more! Harris writes so beautifully that she draws you into the surroundings and your heart leaves your body and enters a quaint French village while being entertained by all sorts of quirky characters.I would recommend a good bottle of wine, some cheese and a long lazy afternoon to read this enchanting novel. But get ready to book a flight to France once its over. Harris is such a sensual writer that you will be unfulfilled until you experience all of the tastes, sounds, scents and pleasures of France along with her characters. I am convinced about both France and Harris.

This novel must be read with an educated mind or at least a cultural understanding of what it produced in order to benefit from its pages. It is not a simple read; in fact I found it quite needlessly lengthy and cumbersome but it just might teach you something important about the conditions of faith in other parts of the world.As a novel, "The Satanic Verses," is an epic about human frailty and the ever present battle between good and evil. It begins in the English Channel with a crashing plane and two men who seem to fall from the sky. Gibreel Farishta, an Indian movie star, borders between a life of excess and consumption and life as an archangel who has lost his faith. It is often difficult to tell where Gibreel is really coming from. Saladin Chamcha returns from Bombay to London where he hovers between life and death as either human or a strangely metamorphosed creature resembling a devil. Neither man contains pure evil or innocent good so the struggle to live or die causes them to knock against the doors of heaven and hell with equal regard. It is a very human struggle written behind a fairy-tale idealism.Salman Rushdie is obviously well educated and his writing borders upon snobbishness having missed the ability to relate to an audience rather than attempt to impress one. In my opinion this novel was horribly calculated in order to anger an already emotional crowd while reaching the echelons of controversy and thus further his debatable career. Had Rushdie been a truly great writer of literature he wouldn't have needed the now notorious backlash to sell his ideas. The difficulty with this novel exists in its complicated cultural references making it far too remote for an average reader to understand unless they are willing to spend a few hours educating themselves to the ways of India, the Middle East and Islamic religious practices. Rushdie writes with a frenzied chaos and forgets to reach out towards the average reader. But his writing certainly begs for a deeper understanding if in fact one actually does exist.A few recommendations prior to taking on this novel, be sure to have at hand a dictionary, a book on Indian and Middle Eastern history, an Indian slang reference, of course the Holy Qur'an and possibly, "The Rushdie Affair," (by Daniel Pipes) to explain it all. At the minimum you must have a very vivid imagination, an extremely open and tolerant mind and finally the ultimate desire to learn something new. Rushdie's words will have your mind spinning in several directions at once maybe this pattern is purposeful to some extent, if you don't pay attention you just might miss some of the worst slights. At the core of all the controversy are a few verses that the Prophet Muhammad was supposed to have written (by some historic accounts) to please authorities so that he could continue his preaching's. These verses seem to acknowledge Meccan goddesses and allowed nobles to accept the Prophet but it also placed Islam in controversy because the entire basis of the religion is monotheistic, the Qur'an without fault and these verses placed doubt behind the entire validity of Islam if in fact they were ever considered by the Prophet. The angel Gabriel is said to have grumbled about Muhammad's actions claiming the acceptance of goddesses to be stemming from Satan himself. Thus the verses were stricken from God's word by God himself via Gabriel. Rushdie implies further that the scripture which Islam is based upon, the Holy Qur'an, was in fact not written by God through the angel Gabriel, but from the man Muhammad who instead dictated words to Gabriel, thus making Islam human rather than faith based. Here is where the sacrilege came into play because Rushdie implied that Islamic faith is deceitful. Rushdie attempts to cover his tracks through creative uses of names and historical references, i.e. using the name Mahoud for Muhammad and Jahilia ("ignorance" in Arabic) for Mecca. Needless to say Rushdie placed his own head on a platter and it appears he served it up without naive innocence but rather with a huge slathering of egoism! I think that people of any faith will be able to see the injustice and a fine line appears between independent thought and all out blasphemy.

It seems that wherever racism exists a fence threatens to be built even to this day. This film is just another example of the world's great racial divide and brings to light the much ignored history of Aboriginal people.Director Phillip Noyce has created a simple movie with a huge impact. He used real Aboriginal actors and managed to get a mountain of emotion out of the eyes of the three young girls that the movie centers around, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. The story is based upon a true tale written by one of the central character's children. It begins happily with a beautiful family of Aborigines who exist in Australia during the 1930's, they live off the land in a peaceful existence until the white society decides that the "black" needs to be blended into the white race and eliminated, hints of Nazism invade here. Camps are set up and girls are captured to be trained and blended into the "supreme" white society without a care, almost as if they were merely cattle and not actual human beings.The majority of the film is spent following the three girls through their escape from the camps and into the desert. It is adventurous, thrilling and often horribly sad. The girls encounter people along the way who see them as human and some help is offered through crusts of bread and warm coats. They follow a fence line to find their way back home and end up traveling for nine weeks and over about 1,500 miles. The ending is beautifully touching and well worth the adventure.I learned something new from this film. I was never aware of what white society tried to do to the Aborigines, yet another horrid aspect of racism not taught in average schools. It seems that Australia committed atrocities towards the Aborigines well through the 1970's and possibly even to this day to some extent. While I am constantly disappointed by humanity and its constant desire to separate the races I was not disappointed in this film. It is a beautiful and heroic saga about the human spirit and the struggle for personal freedom. Let this fence topple all others with its important message.

This film is a good thriller but it starts off slowly. The cast is interesting and international and the story sadly too believable.The plot of this film is basically fulfilled in the London underground where the poorer aspects of society exist. A Nigerian doctor in hiding makes his way in life by driving cabs, working a hotel front desk and administering antibiotics to low life men with penile infections. He lives on the brink of an illegal world running from immigration authorities. This character is played nicely by Chiwetal Ejiofor. French actress Audrey Tautou plays an illegal Turkish woman who offers her couch to Ejiofor, befriending him while working as a maid in the same hotel. Both characters become involved in an underground scheme that offers money and passports to illegal immigrants who are willing to sell their internal organs on the black market.This movie is interesting and I would imagine far to close to the truth for many poor immigrants who exist in countries as they try to escape torture within their own. It is suspenseful once you get into the meaning of the film and the ending is worth the wait. The sad plot filled with hookers, men that threaten women with sex, drug dealers and a row of men infected with sexual diseases is pretty disgusting but they all add to the dreary story deep in the London underground.

This book of short stories centered in or around Wyoming is about half great but really half bad. I only found 3 of the 11 works worth reading though I forced myself to read them all. It sort of shocks me that a writer of Proulx's stature and talent could not inspire me to love the great state of Wyoming....not even close.This book is filled with stories written with intelligence but most never quite grasp the reader with their meaning. The pages are mostly just an endless descriptionary of tumbleweeds, thin lipped, stubble faced and leathery people with no dreams and no hope. The wind blows a lot and the only thing that survives much is cows and alcohol. It was simply frustrating to me to have to read one whole page about how a tumbleweed crosses the road....very slowly! The people in the majority of the short works are severely depressing souls without much as far as character, integrity or redeeming value so I found my mind a wanderin'. Maybe I'll try Montana next time.Proulx has a few shining stars in this book that redeem her writing and imagination, thankfully. "The Half-Skinned Steer" is a shocking look at ranch life that flows well enough. "A Lonely Coast" provides a glimpse into what it's like to love a cowboy and yet never know where you stand. The best quote comes from "Pair a Spurs": "Men had that flaw in them, Inez thought, to go over the cliff of events and fall precipitously into moral sin." (Page 165). But by far the best aspect of this book stems from Proulx's wonderful story, "Brokeback Mountain," which is probably one of the greatest short stories ever written, and now amazingly well adapted for the movie screen.I imagine Wyoming must hold something more to its mystery than dead and dying things. I imagine it to be a place of great splendor and vast emptiness but compared to complicated urban sprawl it must be magnificent and I wish Annie Proulx had captured a sense of this next to the harshness of the state. The stories in this book beg to be written simply rather than overly educated with their big words and thousands of descriptions. An ole cowboy wouldn't be sayin' words that can only be found in an Ivy League thesaurus so maybe that's why I felt out of range with the stories in this book.

Paris has what must be the most beautifully peaceful cemeteries in all the world. Each tombstone becomes a extraordinary tribute to a life well lived. This guide book provides maps, some photographs and interesting biographical clips about a few of the permanent residents of Paris. The book gives directions to graves of such well known Parisians as Marcel Proust, Emile Zola, Isadora Duncan, Oscar Wilde, Alexander Dumas, Gertrude Stein just to name a few. Walking tours are provided for Pere Lachaise, The Pantheon, St. Etienne-du-Mont, Montmartre, St. Vincent, Les Invalides, Passy, St. Germain-des-Pres, The Catacombs, Montparnasse, La Chapelle Expiatoire, St. Denis and a few others.After taking this guide with me on a trip to Paris I was able to find every grave I searched for with ease and an understanding of exactly what made these permanent Parisians so interesting. Pere Lachaise is overwhelming in scale but probably the most popular cemeterie in Paris. The Pantheon holds scientists and philosophers. Les Invalides proudly holds the remains of a little man named Napoleon with a great big history. The Catacombs are spookily interesting. Montparnasse has many tombstones that could be sculptures standing in the best art houses of Paris. My favorite cemeterie in all of Paris is Passy, a peaceful, quaint refuge underneath the Eiffel Tower, where birds are chirping and old graves lay covered in simple coats of moss and chipped iron, you can almost feel the restful sleep of those who reside within its walls.

I found this film to be disturbing, haunting and quite confusing.Clint Eastwood did a great job directing this film, allowing the actors to take on the character's personas with stunning ability. He also kept extremely close to life as it exists in the Boston suburbs, nothing fancy or colorful, just an average working class living. The actors were cast in nearly perfect roles for their vulnerabilities. Eastwood allowed the story to evolve without pushing but I wish he would have included more explanation and a more thorough ending.Sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar. He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out. Tim Robbins edged upon scary as his character dealt with the consequences of his childhood. Kevin Bacon seemed a little too reserved and I kept expecting him to open up and really act at some but sadly he never did. The wives are all a little too sappy for my taste and seemed to agree with whatever their crazy husbands decided to do so I was disapointed by their characters.This film is good and mysterious but sort of leaves one hanging at the end with many strings seemingly unconnected that should have been. Sean Penn's performance is well worth the watch however. At least I was eventually able to figure out where the title &quot;Mystic River&quot; came from, but as for the rest of my questions I will search for them in the novel.

Although this film is far from perfect it is a wonderful depiction of Paris during the infamous 1920's when all the great American writers and artists resided there.Nick Hart (Keith Carradine) is a starving American artist who haunts little Parisian cafes with his charcoal pencil and drawing pad in hand as he sketches people he deems interesting. He becomes intrigued with a darkly mysterious woman named Rachel Stone (Linda Fiorentino) and her corruptly powerful husband Bertram Stone (John Lone). As the story unfolds we discover a past exists between Hart and Mrs. Stone and danger follows their lurking interests along Parisian streets. Mr. Stone is supposedly an art dealer/collector who seems to know all of the most important of people while reducing those he cares little for to pulp. A drunken Hemmingway (Kevin J. O'Connor) along with the likes of Alice B. Tolkas (Ali Giron) and her mate Gertrude Stein (Elsa Raven) make fleeting appearances during the film in a half-hearted attempt to maintain the allure of Paris during the 20's. Hart discovers a way to make a living through his involvement with a rich heiress (Geraldine Chaplin) and an influential gallery owner (Genevieve Bujold) but this connection could also be his decline.If you are someone who carries on a romance with Paris and all that she holds then you will probably find this film very appealing. Director Alan Rudolph manages to capture what life must have been like during the time of Hemmingway, Fitzgerald and Stein as Americans in Paris. One would almost prefer he had made a film directly related to the famous people he randomly refers to in this movie, we all know they were in themselves extraordinarily interesting subjects. But overall this film is worth watching despite the little imperfections and a bit of bad acting here and there. Carradine and Fiorentino display a decent chemistry in order to carry the story to completion. As always though the true hero here is Paris, a city as old as it is timeless.

This is a nicely done period movie depicting the life and loves of the controversial 19th century French writer George Sand.George Sand was one of the world's first feminists, preferring to personify the life of a male rather than cower to the nitwit life of a woman in the 19th century. Sand chose to divorce an abusive husband, make a living as a writer and stand up for her beliefs although they were harshly criticized during her era. As a writer Sand took on the flaws of society in her characters and scolded the public in her subtle but effective way. As a woman Sand was far from beautiful but she had numerous affairs of the heart with many famous and powerful men. She managed to thrill her lovers with her mind and her ever present need to be free from constraints, preferring to set her lovers free yet they always came running back for more or went crazy doing so. Needless to say Sand is an extraordinarily interesting subject but to really know her one must read about her because she is far too limited by film.This film is wonderful but incomplete. Judy Davis plays the great George Sand about as perfectly as she can be played on film. Davis takes on the famous characteristics of Sand, the tomboyish walk, her bold feministic approach and her enduring passion for life and love. In this film Sand is introduced only briefly as a young girl without much explanation as to how she arrived at her independent nature. Sand is already a successful writer dividing her time between her estate, Nohant, and Paris. She is frustrated because she has fallen out of "like" with her children's tutor (who continues to pursue her madly), but soon becomes infatuated with Frederic Chopin, a frail and sickly Polish composer. As she pursues Chopin, she continues to deny former lovers such as poet Alfred de Musset. The film is actually quite entertaining although much of the history involved in these famous relationships is lost in the effort. Hugh Grant is convincingly fragile and helpless as Chopin. Mandy Patinkin insanely perfect as Alfred de Musset. Bernadette Peters is great as the backstabbing and snide social climber, Marie D'Agoult. But this movie would not be complete without the comic wit of Emma Thompson as a rich but bored Duchess who preys on the artistic talent willing to spend time at her estate.George Sand is too much woman to be contained in one film but she is almost captured in Judy Davis's performance. Had the filmmakers made this movie into a mini-series instead I believe it would have done history and Ms. Sand more justice. However this glimpse into the life of an amazing individual who stood alone against her own machine will inspire you to read and search for more details about Sand's fabulous life.

Danny Glover directs this film about a young boy growing up in Dayton, Ohio during the 1960's.A young boy finds himself struggling with his youthful innocence and the sins of adulthood. His father, (Robbie Benson), and his mother, (Ally Sheedy) have a relationship that is falling apart. Benson is the town doctor and apparently he has a few activities on the side that take him away from his family. In search of a father figure the young boy befriends an African American man who has a crush on Marilyn Monroe and a Native American bartender who offers up a bit of wise advice and hope every now and then. Both men teach the boy about life and the struggles of right and wrong. Another influence in the boy's life is a strong woman (Amy Madigan) who owns the bar that the boy works for. Surrounded by the arms of these unlikely friends the boy grows into a wise and happy soul. The writing is well done and most of the characters rich with meaning.The best part of this film has to do with the fantasy as it revolves around Marilyn Monroe. The dreams of the characters seem somehow distant and unobtainable, just like those in reality, but when some dreams finally come true the scenes are absolutely touching. This film is a true sleeper, lost somehow in the shuffle but well worth its weight in gold. The story is inspirational in a softly portrayed way showing us that sometimes life is more than just another dream.

This dark comedy is a barrel of laughs and worthy of more attention than it received.Danny DeVito directs yet another great comedy frayed with darkness around its edges. He manages to create humor from characters that are struggling with their consequences. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are a young couple in search of more space to live in when they are sold a duplex by a slimy real estate agent, played by Harvey Fierstein. But the duplex comes with conditions that unfold as the movie progresses. Living above the young couple is an old Irish lady (brilliantly played by Eileen Essel) who creates all sorts of comedic havoc. Appearing sweet and innocently feeble she irritates and riles her landlords with the blare of her TV, constant calls for assistance and a many more silly moments that will leave you in stitches. The young couple is driven crazy and that only leads to additional antics well written and as funny as can be.Stiller and Barrymore are perfectly cast as the young couple with Stiller stealing most of the scenes with his neurotic, paranoid and defensive acting. Just his facial expressions alone are enough to rob you of a few laughs. But the star of the movie is Eileen Essel who has an unending sense of humor and natural comedic energy that rivals Stiller's. Beside Essel is a macaw that adds a bit of animal life to the scenes and flaps about with additional value. Leave it to DeVito to add a bit of a dark twist at the end. He has created a film with imagination and fun antics tinged with blackness and danger as only DeVito can.

Judy Reeves has boxed together a book of prompts and practices along with cards that offer advice on the practice of creative writing.This set is a nice gift for anyone who suffers from writer's block or who wants to embark on a career in creative writing. The book offers a year of writing prompts, recommended readings, many quotes from famous writers and several pages of open journal pages that holds all of the inspiration one might receive. The cards offer 25 suggestions for becoming a better writer, from overcoming bad habits to developing new ideas freely.All in all this is a nicely packaged set for a gift to a would-be writer. For serious writers I recommend Reeve's more thorough book on writing, "A Writer's Book of Days". But any inspiration is good inspiration!

This film is cinematically stunning and makes an impact in subtle ways just as the book did, but offers a few alterations to the original novel.The story involves a young maid (Scarlett Johansson) who is employed to work for the family of painter Vermeer (Colin Firth) in Holland during the 17th century. Instilled within Griet, the young maid, is sensitivity to art which she received from her father who was once an artistic tile maker until blinded in an accident. Griet is sent to work for the Vermeer's because her family no longer has a breadwinner to support their expenses. She toils about in her new job unable to really fit in with the children of the family or the other maid. Her love of color and art draws the attention of the house master, Johannes Vermeer, and she is soon his unofficial assistant. Vermeer is entranced by Griet because in his own wife (Essie Davis) and mother in law (Judy Parfitt) he is seen as merely a commodity to maintain their aristocratic lifestyle. Vermeer struggles to matter and bonds with Griet. Needless to say the story becomes complex and ends with the power and beauty of a little pearl earring.Johansson is perfectly cast as the young woman depicted in Vermeer's famous painting, "Girl With a Pearl Earring," and the masterpiece is brought to life when she poses for the painting in this film. Colin Firth plays Vermeer in a troubled sense, restless and alone in his art while bowing to subjects in order to make a living for his ever growing family. Firth is both distant and intimate in his role with few lines but great intensity. The role of Vermeer's jealous wife, Catharina, is played with excellence by the luminous Essie Davis. Other mentions are Judy Parfitt who plays the controlling mother in law and Tom Wilkinson who portrays Master Van Ruijven with expert creepiness. The scenes are beautifully shot and bring the gray chill of Holland in 1664 to life with great effect all intermingled of course with Vermeer's fantastic art.My only complaint with this film is that the story does not follow the book in the end. It is not incomplete but will seem so if you read the novel first. Either way I feel it is well worth the viewing but don't forget to read the novel by Tracy Chevalier as well. Both formats explain the innocence of the era while weaving tremendous passion and beauty into a simple story filled with naive obsession and the power of a little pearl earring on a beautiful girl.

&quot;Chocolat&quot; is a movie based on Joanne Harris's novel of the same name. I recommend experiencing both.This movie is visually stunning with alot of work having been done to perfect the scenery so that the viewer is transported into a quaint little French Town. The musical score is upbeat and passionate which adds a special dimension to the film.Johnny Depp does an excellent job as the gypsy drifter that is greeted with reserve and prejudice by the uptight townspeople. Juliette Binoche plays the single woman with child who blows into town with a wind and leaves it in stiches. She opens a chocolate shop and falls prey to the overly religious mayor of the town because she entices others to sin during lent. I have to say that my favorite character is played by Dame Judy Dench, she is the free spirit of the town refusing in all of her years to be programmed by the rest of the world. She indulges in the delicious chocolate despite being diabetic and scolded by doctors and her own daughter. The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires.A sweetly sinful indulgence indeed!!

This is the second book in the &quot;If&quot; series of questions. By now the answers should be easier but &quot;If 2&quot; provokes 500 more questions to contemplate each one a little deeper in theory than those contained in book one. Another great conversation piece and get-to-know-you type book.

This film is a romance with a twist even a touch quirky but well worth viewing for both the writing and acting.Louise Harrington (Laura Linney) is a 39 year old college admissions worker. Her marriage/divorce from Professor Peter Harrington (Gabriel Byrne) is amicable but as friends new incidents that occurred during their marriage are revealed which throw Louise off kilter. Almost at the same time a young art student appears with the name F. Scott Feinstadt (Topher Grace) and his name is not the only coincidence to an old love who passed away. Searching for connection Louise interviews F. Scott and a May-December relationship begins but not without its faults. Does Louise love F. Scott or the memory of another man? Add to the flame her best friend Missy Goldberg (Marcia Gay Harden) who encourages the memory and adds to the mess.Laura Linney is wonderful in her role as a woman with a re-ignited flame. Opposite Linney is Marcia Gay Harden as the stalking greedy best friend always looking to one up Linney. Gabriel Byrne does a great job as a troubled professor who can't seem to figure out his true heart. And Topher Grace accomplishes the naive student role extremely well however for my tastes he isn't the perfect romantic lead...a little too boyish in my opinion and a sort of creepy. But the idea is certainly interesting. Is it re-incarnation, mistaken identity or just a strange coincidence luckily it is all explained in the end.P.S.......Not sure this film would have worked if the gender roles had been reversed!

Eric Maisel has given us a nice book filled with inspiration and creative guidance.This book is structured in 52 weekly segments starting with beginning work and ending up with a project that should be completed. Each short chapter contains a brief essay of guidance and then an inventive exercise to try on for size.The author of this book, Eric Maisel, Ph.D., is a psychologist who teaches that the act of creating impacts all aspects of one's life. So this book is intended for everyone, not just those struggling to survive artistic blocks. Executives can develop new business ideas, cooks can create better dishes, lawyers can find new ways to argue, politicians can consider alternative ways to create democracy, children can become better students and so on. Overall an extremely good book for those willing to put forth a bit of effort towards creating new ideas.

Julianne Moore does another fabulous job as an LA housewife exposed to the hazards of suburbia. The film is dark and stale adding to the creepiness of its message.Moore's housewife is lifeless, she exists in LA going from post office to dry cleaners to aerobics class. She sips milk while her Spanish housecleaner does all the actual work of keeping up a home. She does her &quot;wifely duties&quot; with the same boredom with which she lives. Her world is protected and safe but she somehow ends up ill (is it real toxic poisoning or just a cry for attention?) and it all gets chalked up to stress.....what stress could she be having? The creepiness lies in how easily she gets programmed by all the others in her life. With no direction of her own she exists as a mere robotic representation of what she is supposed to be. How many of those do you see in a day?Moore soon becomes so strangely ill that she can't even perform her meaniless tasks. This eventially lands her in a cultish type retreat where she is supposed to get well. Without her own backbone she flounders around influenced by everything external and open to all sorts of advice except what works. So we learn two messages in one movie, first be your own person and second that our environment may in fact be causing more undiagnosed illness than we imagine. Find your own influences before the Jones' get you down and above all stay SAFE!

This movie is a really fun film for the entire family with lots of music and plenty of laughs.Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a loser; he even gets fired from his own band because he can't control his ego and wants the entire limelight. His roommate has grown past the rock and roll life to become a teacher and along with his uptight girlfriend they barrage Dewey with all sorts of negative inspiration forcing him only to withdraw. But then one day a phone call arrives that inspires Dewey into action and he finds himself employed as a substitute teacher at a reserved private school. With a class of brainy nerds awaiting direction Dewey has nothing to offer except music.....and so the story unfolds. Dewey takes this class of intellects and turns them into a great kid's band despite the watchful eyes of the school headmistress Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack).Jack Black is funny just watching him exist in all that hyper energy he possesses but in this movie he gets to also show his stuff around music. Although he is sometimes irritatingly crazy most of the time he is really great in this role as a teacher that knows absolutely nothing. Joan Cusack joins Black as the comic relief in this film as the rigid school marm with a secret passion to be Stevie Nicks and flaunt herself in a rock and roll band. The kids are also great in this film in fact almost musical geniuses playing their own instruments as well as pulling off wonderful acting roles. Everyone can watch this movie and find something to enjoy and it's a great motivator for all the losers of the world who just want to play rock and roll....rock on!

I am not a huge Sci-Fi fan but I must admit I enjoyed the message this movie contained.Christian Bale does an excellent job in this film as the one intelligent person in a dead society who is willing to question an authoritarian system. His acting is found within his eyes, the only bright spot on a face tightened by a society that kills emotion. Some of the fight scenes are a bit &quot;Matrixey&quot; without all the over-priced special effects. Bale's scenes with the puppy will grab at your heart!The concept of this film stays along the lines of the &quot;Matrix,&quot; &quot;Metropolis,&quot; &quot;1984,&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; exposing the horrors of controlled societies. The government controls people in this film by a drug that removes all emotion from their lives, no anger, no fear, no sadness, no laughter and no love. Great art is burned and hidden by the underground who would rather die than live without beauty and emotion. Everything is mechanical, clothing is uniform and dull, relationships are for the growth of the species and crime is punished by a horrible cremating death. The story is facinating but don't fall into line with the robots instead fight for passion, like Christian Bale, without the guns of course!

This film is an interesting adaptation of E.M. Forrester's novel. The story meshes British colonialism and India's great culture into a bowl of horrible racism.Director David Lean did a fine job on this classic story. His direction is subtle and calming somewhat as I imagine India to be in a traditional sense. Unfortunately I had the feeling Lean resorted to stereotypes in his projection of the true India. Some of the scenery seemed adapted to the screen rather than truthful for 1920's India. He scanned over the poorer aspects of this beautiful country in order to save the beauty of his film. Also I found the casting of Alec Guinness (as Indian Prof. Godbole) really atrocious. With all of the decent actors from India why waste a bunch of makeup and fake accents on a British actor who is capable of better roles? Other than these exceptions I felt Lean did a marvelous job filming such a unique and vast country, he frames beautiful landscapes and manages to capture the heart of the moon several times.The actors in this film are marvelous (except for Alec Guinness!) with Peggy Ashcroft and Judy Davis stealing the show as two British women daring to travel and see something other than what feels safe. Davis is somewhat irritating as the boneless woman who can't decide if she wants marriage or love, she is passionless and becomes intimidated or enthralled by the passion found in India. Because of her wavering existence she jeopardizes the life of Dr. Aziz (played perfectly by Victor Banerjee) by accusing this honorable man of rape. Needless to say the powerful British take this accusation as a reason to act upon their upper class laurels and persecute the Indians. And yet another picture shows the devastation of racism at the hands of a white society touted as being civil.This film is a bit long and begins with a tinge of boredom but once the story unfolds and you find yourself transported to the beautiful scenic views of India it is worth the effort. The way the peaceful native Indians were treated by the British who occupied their country is horrible and the racism absolutely deplorable but the facts are important to history and in need of being told. Too bad the entire world could not see through the eyes of Mrs. Moore (Ashcroft) and feel that all people deserve the same treatment but I guess we have to wait for another passage to open up before that happens.

This movie is dark, violent and quietly interesting as a look into the mind of a lonely woman who decays into psychopathic behavior.May (played perfectly by Angela Bettis) is born with a lazy eye that causes her to be outcast from her peers at an early age. She grows into womanhood not knowing or feeling love, admiration or respect except what her mind conjures up from a spooky doll that she claims as her best friend. May spends her days working in an animal hospital and her nights sewing parts of clothing together. Along the way she meets people that continue to treat her poorly, namely a mechanic with beautiful hands (Jeremy Sisto) and a co-worker seductress (Anna Faris). Desperate for a true friend May volunteers to help blind children and takes on the ownership of a cat but all of her relationships unravel just like the thread she works with every night.Lucky McKee wrote and directed this off-beat and twisted film and in doing so managed to reach the darkest corners of human interest. We all carry insecurities and in our weakest state hope for revenge against those who betray our confidences, but thankfully most of us never go so far as May. McKee takes an in-depth look at how a mind twists after years of torment and loneliness, he offers a bit of humor and light hearted pokes at his character's despair before delving into the ultimate darkness. May is likable as a film and as a character but both are also horribly sad as the pieces get woven together.

This biographical film relates the story of Auschwitz survivor, Dr. Gisella Perl, providing an important chapter into the lives of those poor souls tortured into unthinkable acts in order to survive during the Holocaust of WWII.Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) arrives in New York with tear filled eyes begging for a new life after WWII. Perl wanted to be a doctor from childhood; she studied hard and managed to open a very successful private practice in Hungary. Her only downfall ended up being her bloodlines and this very strong woman soon found herself carted off to Auschwitz. In a series of flashbacks Perl is examined by a committee of American INS men who are judging her character as a step towards her citizenship. Perl is seen as a survivor who at times may have saved her own life at the sake of others and she is accused of collaborating with the Nazi doctor like the retched Josef Mengele. In actuality Perl saved many women by sacrificing the unborn lives of their fetuses after being tricked by Mengele into submission and having to see what went on behind the walls of Auschwitz. Despite the horrors she witnessed Perl survived to flourish once again and her true story is one of an undying spirit.Christina Lahti is phenomenal in her role as Gisella Perl. She manages to capture both the brokenness and the strength of this woman with equal determination. Many scenes in this film are absolutely gut-wrenching but entirely important. As stated in the film Auschwitz became its own country and the "rules of humanity" no longer applied. Under these circumstances many atrocities were committed by Nazi's and the Jewish prisoners alike...who is to say what depths a human being can reach under the horror of the Holocaust? In order to thrive in the conditions faced by the prisoners they were forced to either submit and then be burned alive or to calculate another way of living. Gisella Perl did just that. Despite how you feel about abortions this woman had to perform the procedures bare handed and under intolerable conditions in order to save the lives of women prisoners. She was forced under threat to assist in "experiments" beside Mengele and even went as far as saving a female Nazi guard from her own "predicament" without question. Placed in the same circumstances few of us would have ever survived so leave your moral judgments behind on this one. Instead allow this one woman's story to matter so that the ashes of Auschwitz and all of the other concentration camps never establish a foothold in our world again.

This film starring Colin Farrell is interesting at best but doesn't quite fill the bill.Farrell does a great job running through every emotion possible while being stuck in a NY city phone booth at the mercy of a creepy voiced sniper (played by Keifer Sutherland). But the film stays incomplete because nothing is ever explained. Why did the sniper pick him? What is the sniper's motivation? Had the motives been explained it may have been a hit.Don't waste a dime on this DVD, wait until you can catch it on TV unless you are a true Colin Farrell fan.

This film is interesting and suspenseful the entire way through. Both clever and well written it tells the story of a military training mission gone wrong from the perspective of several different officers. The cast of characters are great with the best performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Giovanni Ribisi and Harry Connick Jr.If you are looking for a military movie this will satisfy you but it takes more credit as a murder mystery. It is gripping, intriguing and a great whodunit with a twist that is unpredictable at the end. Highly entertaining and well worth the ride.

First of all I will say that the importance of the concept for this film is necessary and much overlooked. The involvement of American Indians in war is sadly left out of too many history books.I was hoping this film would be better than it turned out to be. The historical facts should be recoginized along side all of the other celebrations of war heroes. Sadly this film was a complete bomb. The direction was predictable and the action scenes could have been shot by a five year old boy playing &quot;war hero&quot; in the backyard, alot of noise and piles of dust and actors pretending to be dead. All this with the constant drone of a musical score best left for a karoke bar to hum along to.And what happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to be a great actor with individual style and presentation. It seems that he just keeps slipping away. I just was not convinced of his &quot;hero&quot; ability in this film....and his death scene is almost the most horrendous I have ever witnessed, not for the gore or emotional impact, but because it was simply awful acting!

This movie exposes the events surrounding the brutal murders of four people on Wonderland Drive in 1981 bringing insight into a mystery never quite solved.John Holmes (Val Kilmer) made a name for himself and his "member" during the 70's as a popular porn star but the excess he lived with only served him poorly in the end. In this film we meet Holmes as an aged drug addict with no real ambition or future other than staying in drugs and trouble. He has left his wife (Lisa Kudrow) and carts around a teenage girl (Kate Bosworth) using her for his drug induced whims along the way. Holmes exists between two powerful parallels where gangs and drugs control emotion and the apparently the ability to remain alive. Several different versions of the notorious night in 1981 are told and a straight answer is never really divulged making it seem possible that the actual murders of Wonderland were never completely solvable.This movie is dark and filmed in a very gritty and up close and personal way by director James Cox. At the forefront Val Kilmer plays Holmes as a drugged up loser who exists in a world of excess, using everyone around him for a moment of induced mindfulness. Kilmer, always great, is dreadful in this role bringing the soiled selfishness of the real Holmes to new life. As his wife Lisa Kudrow exposes herself to the lens as an older, less attractive version of herself but holds her own against Kilmer. Kate Bosworth is the trusting teenage Dawn who ran about with Holmes without understanding her real predicament. Dylan McDermott pulls off a less than attractive role as a tough gangster willing to expose the events of Wonderland to detectives searching for answers. The movie is interesting because it shows how difficult piecing a puzzle together can be when your only answers come from untrustworthy characters. The life of Holmes isn't something to celebrate necessarily but exposing his life as a tragic piece of excess may lead to a better understanding of a world most of us would prefer not to delve into. So it becomes no wonder that the Wonderland murders occurred only that it was a bad road to travel down.

I picked up this book knowing it would be different and initally I found it to be very difficult to keep up with. I found it confusing to try and figure out at what age and time the writer was dealing with. But once I figured out the writer's style and marvelled at his brilliance and individuality I found myself caught up completely in this little tale about Max Tivoli.Andrew Sean Greer has written a book that is profound and very much in its own class. He writes with great prose and many phrases read like poetry, causing one to pause and treasure the thought. I applaud Mr. Greer for writing unlike any other and being brave enough to stick his neck out to reap the rewards.You will fall in love with Max Tivoli, pain in his lonliness and ache for someone to love him. It is such an interesting concept to start from the end, to be old when you are young and young when you are old. Maybe we should all try a bit of his wisdom. Max reminds me of an old soul reincarnated into a young child and hindered by all the handicaps of youth and then slowed once again by the horrors of aging just when exuberance is at its most inspirational. It brings new meaning to deja-vu'!! While Max brings such sadness it is a wonderful thing to feel emotion just from the simplicity of reading. I wish more books were written with such warmth and heart.

How can you review a Toni Morrison novel? With the humbleness and appreciation that only she deserves. Morrison is simply a masterpiece to the English language, writing with an individual prose that only she can perfect with such intensity. Her novels linger within you and ripen with age. But beware for you can never walk away reading her stories only once and "Love" begs for more.The basic ideal of "Love" is as simple and as complex as love itself. Bill Cosey is the man that all of Morrison's characters love and hate with intense fervor. At the center of life for May, Christine, Heed, Junior, Vida, L and Celestial, he wraps their lives in mystery and passion like no other becoming a father, a lover, a friend, a husband, a security blanket and even a beast to all those he encounters in the little town of Up Beach. Each of Morrison's women is weakened in some way by Bill Cosey yet they find strength within one another and in love. The relationships are rich and riddled with secrecy, so much so that one read will never reveal this novel's full meaning.Toni Morrison's phrasing in this book is shear literary perfection. Despite the difficulty and moments of absolute confusion that will appear while reading this novel, the effort it takes is only something to be gained. Read it once and feel satisfied, twice and be enlightened, more and feel its true gift of love.

Having no expectations I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this little film about nerds in search of a dream.Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the high school nerd who gets pushed around and taunted by the cool kids. He befriends a new kid Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and together they form a union that takes them into the political arena, running for school president against the most popular girl, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff). But Napoleon must also deal with his missing Grandmother (Sandy Martin), his nerdier brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his haphazardly enterprising Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). With a subdued laugh a minute Napoleon's life is revealed with a bang.This little film may seem rather dull at first but once the Quaalude induced dark humor of the title character makes his point you will beg for more. Jon Heder is absolutely convincing as the buck toothed, pale and athletically inept Dynamite, just looking at him doing nothing will begin the giggles! Along with Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries you can't ask for a better comedic team to marvel at. Gries gets the gist of the cool nerd down, spending most of his time trying to be attractive but falling far short while Ruell is at an even tie with Heder for who plays the perfect outcast. Under all the humor of course lies the dark life of someone who doesn't "fit-in" and in a casual way the filmmakers divulge this side of life without making it so harsh as to make a definite statement, although the point is made within the blast that is Napoleon. Make sure to stay until the credits are run for a short hint about the outcome of all the character's lives. This movie is simply a blast!

Daniel Wallace has written an adult fairy tale that can appeal to the ages, it's about families and tall tales, about truth versus reality and about what makes a person decide to get up and go each and every morning.William Bloom is faced with his father's death and forced to deal with his tall telling father's view of how his life unfolded. Edward Bloom spent his life spinning a myth and created a legend in his own mind. As William sorts through all of the fantasy lives his father created it leads one to wonder where the truth begins and the daydream ends. Edward Bloom was loved by everything in his made-up world, he could do the whole thing faster and better and he also met the most amazing people along the way. William searches for his real father amongst the ruins of his tales and ends up conducting his own inherited legend in an unintentional twist of fate. William creates his father's death in four different ways in hopes of finding the perfection worthy of his imaginative father. In doing so he finds more than he bargained for and he skims the line between realities and dreams himself.Wallace is a beautiful writer and has written a book like no other here. With a sense of humor and a child's idyllic wonder he tells his own tall tale through the depth of his characters. His readers will be taken on a very special journey that crosses the bridge between a warped reality and a boring everyday life. Finding the enjoyment in an exaggerated fib here and there can't be all that bad. If it takes a fantasy to fully experience life then so be it, sometimes tall tales lead us away from nightmares. Wallace brings us a wonderful fantasy laced with the sentimentality of a son yearning for a deeper understanding of his father as he lay dying. Written in almost a fairy tale format with short clips of wonder and longer snips full of moral fiber Wallace's story is unforgettable. Big Fish will make you smile, laugh and even shed a mountain of tears but mostly it will make you appreciate your own family's legends and search for a few new fish in that great big sea of dreams.

This little novel about the atrocities suffered by Afghani people is a real eye-opener and only takes an afternoon to get through but it will stay with you for a lifetime.Yasmina Khadra is actually a man, Mohammed Moulessehoul, and he has written a hauntingly beautiful novel filled with spirit and tragedy along with many important truths. Khadra takes his readers through the daily lives of two main characters along with their wives and profoundly reveals the harshness of life in Kabul under the Taliban rule. In a country out of control and under a religious zealot scrutiny we meet Moshen and his wife Zunaira. Moshen is changing and sadly falling to the stresses of what his once enjoyable life has become. His wife Zunaira, still extraordinarily beautiful and strong now finds herself shrouded in darkness under a dirty burqa and within the walls of her home now boarded up. Moshen and Zunaira are subjected to abuses outside their home and begin to lose their sense of self-worth thus expanding the despair into their relationship at home as well. Another family exists in Kabul who will play an integral part in the lives of Moshen and Zunaira, this couple is Atiq and his wife Musarrat. Atiq must work and he finds himself employed at a woman's jail and becomes the last person who walks the imprisoned women towards their executions. Atiq can see the injustice but can do nothing about the rules imposed upon society by the Taliban. His wife, Musarrat, is aged and ailing under the strain of life and the lack of healthcare but she is Atiq's one shining light. Khadra weaves the lives of these two families into one that will remain in your heart.Watching how life unfolds in Afghanistan today on the TV does not give the actual existence a voice but this novel by Khadra certainly does. It is possible to smell the stench, to breathe the filth, to taste the bitterness and to see the destruction through Khadra's words. He touches upon the way a life changes when faced with circumstances no longer under individual control. He makes sense out of hatred and the depths of hopelessness suffered by people who see no future. So where do they turn? Khadra describes so eloquently the beginnings of "terrorism" in this verse, "Whenever Atiq sees these children, he feels a deep uneasiness. They're invading the city inexorably, like the packs of wild dogs that turn up out of nowhere, feed in rubbish dumps and garbage cans, eventually colonize whole neighborhoods, and keep the citizenry at bay. The innumerable madrassas, the religious schools that spring up like mushrooms on every street corner, no longer suffice to hold all the children. Every day, their numbers increase and their threat grows, and no one in Kabul cares." Khadra provides a key to the world on where "terrorism" begins and shows the world that hate and more violence isn't the way to end something that begins in such misery. This little book of insight into life within Kabul is sometimes hard to swallow but then all medicine starts out that way until the benefits are reaped.

With a cast like the one starring in this comedy how can it go wrong? It doesn't and is actually a funny romp filled with pranks and antics.Ashton Kutcher plays a quiet young man secretly carrying a crush on his boss's daughter, Tara Reid. The boss is a rigid, angry business man who expects perfection and no errors; he is perfectly cast and played by Terence Stamp. The story begins with Kutcher accepting a house-sitting job for Reid believing he was going to have a date instead. He is given strict rules and regulations on what not to do in the house by his boss, he is to feed and doctor a pet owl (with all sorts of neurotic behaviors), leave no damage to anything and protect the house from invaders (despite a bear trap on the lawn meant to do so). Needless to say all hell breaks loose when a cast of characters shows up filled with comedic havoc (Andy Richter, Molly Shannon, Michael Madsen, Jeffrey Tambor, Carmen Electra and Dave Foley).This film is filled with great comedy, silly antics and a constant stream of characters that will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Kutcher shines as the inept hero and the other comedians perfect their odd roles and bring them to hilarious life, get ready to laugh!

This book is now one of my favorite all time reads! Rick Bass did an excellent job of bringing his readers into his world in Yaak, Montana- you can actually vision the beauty of the environment though his words. He makes bird hunting seem mysterious, romantic, beautiful and honest- nothing I would have thought I would feel. I read the book because it was about a dog but I finished it with so much MORE!! Beautiful verses with depth and emotion throughout- you will cry and you will laugh. I was actually sad I had finished this book, it's been with me ever since. I ran out and bought Rick Bass's other books today!!

I expected more from this film than it held. With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise cast in this novel adaptation how could it fail?I understand that the novel written by Phillip Roth was difficult to adapt to the screen which may have led to the so-so effect of this film despite a brilliant cast. I found the film to be slow and straining to get through but good enough to watch. The story is very American centering on the acts of a man born as an African American but light skinned enough to pass for white. Because of the era that this character (Hopkins) grew up in his success or failure, sadly, could have been driven by the color of his skin so he chose to pretend to be white and disown his family instead. As a college dean many years later he makes a remark that is construed to be a racial slur and his life changes drastically. Following his wife's death and the loss of his position in life he begins an unlikely affair with an illiterate woman (Kidman) who is running from her own life in many ways. The characters are interesting and filled with depth but the film tends to show them in almost a shallow context.Nicole Kidman is very good as the 34 year old illiterate woman who has an affair with Hopkins who is much older. She is vulnerable and secretive and on the run from her husband who is abusive and controlling. Kidman scores highly in many of the scenes exhibiting a great deal of emotional effort in this role. Anthony Hopkins is typically brilliant as the troubled man of questionable race. Through flashbacks we meet the younger man that Hopkins plays and are able to grasp why he chose to betray his race for success. Ed Harris is superb as the stalking ex-Vietnam vet husband of Kidman. Harris's character is eerily unstable and although he only appears in a few scenes he manages to steal them nonetheless. The stabling force in all of this character study is Gary Sinise who is a writer that befriends Hopkins and eventually pieces the entire story together. All of the actors are excellent but somehow the film just doesn't cut it and is a bit of a strain to get through surprisingly.

This movie is great for baseball and Bernie Mac fans but it strikes out on the writing and plot and would probably work better after a few beers and hot dogs.Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) is an arrogant and boastful Milwaukee Brewers baseball player who retires believing he holds a hit record. His retirement couldn't have been more politically incorrect and he swings a few hits aimed below the belt at the exact people he will come to need in the end. Finding the life of a retired ball-player not what it is cracked up to be he decides to return to the game to correct his faulty hit record. His return sparks a flame with an old love, reporter Mo (Angela Bassett), and he has to reach far beyond his seventh inning stretch to keep in her good graces. He only needs 3 hits but will his body, mind and attitude cooperate....its a new game in town.Bernie Mac deserves a better role although he does his best to pull this badly written part off. His best scenes involve a modern workout regime! Next to Mac is Angela Bassett who is given a horrible role as a sports reporter who spends all of her time catering to the arrogant has-been Stan Ross. Both actors get a walk on this at bat, falling short of the home runs they are capable of. Great music and baseball scenes though!

This film is a great suspenseful thriller with a decent enough cast to be more than interesting, but it is also superfluous and irritating at times.The story is a real twister and will keep you guessing until the very end. Murders are being committed in Montreal and a team of experts sets out to solve them. As a viewer you are left guessing, then suspecting, and then guessing again. The actors are well cast and appealing in their individual roles with each contributing something worthy to the film. The three French detectives, played by Olivier Martinez, Tcheky Karyo and Jean-Hugues Anglade, are all great in their nose-to-the-grindstone tenacity. Martinez stands out as the sexy mysterious one that stirs a few questions. Kiefer Sutherland appears in an eerie way sending all sorts of messages to your senses and always playing such a part perfectly natural. Ethan Hawke is a witness who seems legitimate but also has an edge to his realm. Gena Rowlands is excellent as a worried mother who believes her evil son may have been the killer of so many young men. So the plot is set get ready for the ride.Of course the star of this movie is Angelina Jolie, a woman who is either amazingly lovely or downright irritating in her roles. Jolie begins this film as an incredibly strong and independent FBI agent/profiler who is appointed to help the Canadian detectives solve the murder mysteries at hand. She is great in the beginning of this film exhibiting a toughness that she sometimes lacks despite the attempt. Jolie is distant and constantly thinking, placing herself in the killer's shoes and attempting to master his/her thoughts. So what happens half-way through this film? Jolie suddenly becomes a stupid inane idiot, falling for someone who has danger signs written all over him, simply because she is lonely. She lowers herself to an entirely gratuitous sex scene and spends all of her close ups concentrating on how enormous her lips are and how much waterproof mascara she can wear. Needless to say I wasn't shocked to find out the director of this film was a man! Jolie's role goes from strength and wisdom to barefoot and pregnant and her integrity almost goes down the drain too. But thankfully with an ending twist she is revived to some degree as the woman she started out to be. Enough with the close-ups we all know she has lips, let her act already.For thriller and murder mystery fans this movie is a perfect treat. For lovers of gore and slasher films this movie contains enough to wet your whistle. Sadly even lovers of Jolie get more than they ever bargained for, much to her disgrace. The director does an excellent job at adding some scare tactics that will leave you jumping as well as a few chase scenes filled with excitement. Overall this film is pretty good but it could have been better if treated with a bit more care and respect for Jolie who ended up taking a few punches along the way.

This book is full of meaning, often insightful and completely unforgettable it is written with candor and wit despite its serious edges.Nega Mezlekia has written a memoir about his boyhood growing up in Ethiopia during the fall of Emperor Selassie. He experiences all of the curious playful things that all boys are reared with yet he also discusses the harshness of the environment during the rise of Junta communism in which thousands of young people were ruthlessly slaughtered. He writes on page 183, "Apathy in the face of continual violence is something someone who has never lived through a war cannot understand......People simply gathered about themselves, like rags, what life there was left, deafened and inured to the inevitability of death." Although Mezlekia has many horrible atrocities to write about this is not all he adheres to. At times this memoir is very witty and I laughed out loud several times imagining some of his shenanigans. His adventures with medicine men and native cures is hilarious as well as his attempt to capture the loose cattle in his village with pepper.I am always impressed with the attitude of Africans who survive the atrocities they have faced in their home countries. Their spirit and survivalist hearts seem to always prevail despite the horrible circumstances they are often forced to endure. Mezlekia managed to escape his country at possibly its worst moments, not without heartache, not without suffering, but with a true gift as a storyteller. I would recommend this memoir to everyone interested in a great true tale but especially to those concerned with the plights of our fellow human beings who suffer so gracefully for their native lands.

I recommend this film as an afterthought to the original novel by Virginia Woolf; it will clarify any confusion and bring an intimacy to Woolf's wordy explanations.Mrs. Dalloway (Vanessa Redgrave/Natascha McElhone) begins her day on a journey to buy flowers for her party. Along the way she encounters a mysterious man ravaged by the memory of war named Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves) who will become a factor towards the end of her delightful day of contemplation. Clarissa Dalloway meets a man from her past, Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen/Alan Cox) and memories of her exuberant youth flood her with thoughts as she goes about her day as an English upper crust wife. Added to Clarissa's memories are thoughts of her long lost friend Sally (Sarah Badel/Lena Headley) a young woman who once embraced the immaturity of whims. So that in the end a day of celebration becomes a deeper exploration into life than Mrs. Dalloway could have ever expected.Virginia Woolf wrote the original novel, "Mrs. Dalloway," in 1925 and she intentionally wanted to stir a contemplated thought process into the art of a novel. She succeeded in that her novel is considered a modern classic and is timeless but extraordinarily complicated. However once read I believe that this film will bring about a closeness to Woolf's original characters and some closure to the reading experience. The actors in this film are all very good with a few standouts like, Redgrave, Graves and McElhone. Thankfully the film stays very close to the original novel and any changes are more of an awakening thought than true alterations. Add "The Hours," (novel/DVD) as an added exploration into Woolf's mind as a writer.

This cute little book is a must have for list makers. With 365 lists to complete you will stay busy for at least a year coming up with new things to do and crossing off old wishes. Some of the lists are goofy and some worth saving for all time. The main idea is to complete the ideas that you originally place on your lists and not just continue making lists for the rest of your life of course. So enjoy and place the emphasis on the &quot;Did It&quot; section!

I decided to read The Known World because I was told it was written with a very informative look towards slavery and offered many ideas not often covered in depth.Unfortunately undertaking the reading of this book started for me with difficulty. I could not grasp the author's writing style and I almost gave up several times in dissapointment. But thankfully I read on and towards the last 100 pages finally got involved. With so many characters to keep track of it would have helped to take notes in the beginning, especially since the author jumps about from time, character and place so often. The author's writing style distracted me from involvement with his characters until the end of the book.But most importantly I learned something new. The Known World expanded my own. Not only did I learn about other sides of slavery, I also learned how to read outside the norm and found myself involved in a facinating read.

Gregory Stock has put together a geart book filled with insightful and thought provoking questions. This little book has so much potential between its pages.I originally purchased this book for myself in my continuous quest to know myself better. It took some time to get through the 200 questions, some of them easy and some requiring great moments of contemplation. This book is also useful at parties, events, dinners and when meeting someone new. It would be a great exercise for relationships as well...opening up a whole new ball game I imagine. But mostly it is just fun and something interesting to think about or discuss with friends.

While the concept of this film is entirely interesting to viewers in search of enlightenment especially when it regards birth, death and transition, it sadly fails in quality.Eliot Jay Rosen hosts this badly filmed documentary in an attempt to show how a soul arrives, leaves and spends one's time on earth. The concept is fascinating and essential to someone on their death bed in my opinion. But the script is haphazard at best with glimpses into the life of a few people dying of cancer, and others who have had life after death experiences. But unfortunately I felt some of the interviewees seemed rather spooky and cultish in their descriptions. Because of this anyone not open to the concept of enlightenment will probably be completely turned off to the idea if they watch this film. For anyone versed on the ideas expressed within this film it is basic at best and just sort of an overview of the theory. The quality of the film is really horrible as if done by amateurs so I found myself being distracted by the film rather than the notion.Rent it.....the purchase isn't worth the experience.

For those days when your own family seems all wrong watch this movie! It is a funny, tragic and beautifully quirky look at family life with a fantastic cast to pull it off.The writers for this film are very talented as they blend tragedy into a comic reality that somehow works. Igby (Kieran Culkin) just wants to grow up feeling important and ultimately loved. Unfortunately he belongs to a crazed and selfish family of mismatched efforts and gets lost in the entire dramatic shuffle. His mother (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate drama queen only accepting what is right from her demented throne and harshly judging anything that falls short. Her husband (Bill Pullman), eventually cracks from the stress and breaks down right in front of poor young Igby's eyes. So life continues for Igby as he is shuffled from private school to military school and never quite grows up. Upon returning to New York he begins work for his eccentric and arrogantly obnoxious god father (Jeff Goldblum) and begins an affair with his god father's mistress (Amanda Peet), a drug popping dancer who never dances. Along for the rest of the ride are notables Claire Danes (playing a college girl on hooky) and Ryan Phillippe, as Igby's irritatingly perfect big brother. This cast is phenomenal with every actor playing their part to a tee and no one upending another.I had no idea what to expect from this film but was pleasingly surprised as I related to the irony found in this misfit family. You may find characters that remind you of your own crazy relatives or you may be thankful for the lack of similarity as well! Overall this film is funny and sad sometimes exactly at the same time and you have to wonder how it all works. Igby may be on his way down but you will root for him to remain up!

For a movie that was deadpanned by the critics this film is actually not so horrible. It is visually stunning with great scenes of Greece and the Mediterranean islands.Madonna stars in this movie as a rich aristocrat with no soul; she is bossy, obnoxious and bitchy. Her character is entirely unlikable and her performance is bland. She perks up after she gets stranded on an island with the super hunk Adriano Giannini, who wouldn't! Once Madonna's role is pared down to survival her acting gets better too. Giannini is excellent as an Italian fisherman trying to earn a few extra bucks working on a Greek yacht. The story becomes a bit predictable until the ending which is actually quite sad.This film's redeeming quality is found in the gorgeous backdrops as well as Giannini's character. It is a blatant slap in the face of the rich and powerful and shows them as a lower class hidden beneath all their wealth. Maybe that is why this film fared poorly at the box office! An afternoon would not be wasted getting swept away by this visually beautiful film.....the story might leave you begging for something more but it isn't horrible.

This film is a French adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's classic tale of human bondage, "Madame Bovary."I expected this adaptation to be better than others I have seen simply because it was done by the French, but sadly the film does not hold up to Flaubert's original work. Isabelle Huppert does a so-so job as the lead character, the great sufferer, Madame Bovary. Huppert does not show enough passion and emotion for my taste though, the original character is consumed by suffering and desperately stabs at whatever form of relief comes her way, but Huppert doesn't quite get any depth out of this performance. She looks lovely in her period costumes however. Madame Bovary succumbed to adultery, debtful spending habits and even suicide while being married to Dr. Bovary and never feeling passionately satisfied with her life. The character is both the ultimate victim of her own circumstances and that of the stigma society held over women of her time. In the classic novel she screams for understanding and compassion but here Huppert only manages to stir a selfish and self-absorbed creature lacking any decent humanity.Contrasting to the Madame is Dr. Bovary, played decently by Jean-Francois Balmer, who manages to bring a sorrow to the dutiful man who cowers at the Madame's feet. Malavoy is sweet and hardworking much as I imagine the original character to be and also sadly unsuspicious of his wicked wife's activities at his expense. The enigmatic and suave character of Rodolphe Boulanger is played by the handsome and convincing Christophe Malavoy. Malavoy is seductively charming and maliciously evil at the same time, the perfect match for Mrs. Bovary!I enjoyed this film for the French aesthetic value but feel the need to dust off my old classic novel and re-read the story as written by the master, Flaubert. I enjoy the message contained in this story about the sin of excess and lack of reason behind decisions, interestingly enough this 1856 novel could use a few more readings in today's world. The film is good but the novel is GREAT, enjoy both for the experience.

Michael Cunningham has written a beautiful modern version of Virginia Woolf's classic "Mrs. Dalloway," managing to capture the complexities of the original and add a few of his own.Clarissa Vaughn begins her day searching for flowers for a party she will throw to celebrate an award her writer friend, Richard, has won. It is Richard who compares Clarissa to the famous literary character "Mrs. Dalloway." As Clarissa goes about her day we are taken back in time to meet Virginia Woolf as she begins to write her classic story. And as we read Virginia's beginning words another of Cunningham's characters, Mrs. Brown, picks up the book to read...."Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself." Cunningham weaves the story of three women into one, all suffer from melancholy, and all struggle with an aspect of her day as they each deal with their own hours in circumstantial and age related ways. Mrs. Brown fails at baking a cake, Clarissa fails as a friend, and Virginia wonders how she failed in life but all the while lurks "Mrs. Dalloway," going about her day hoping to extinguish her own emptiness.Cunningham has managed something quite extraordinary with his re-written modern version of "Mrs. Dalloway." In his version the famous character is free to experience her true heart with the freedoms that modern society has provided. Clarissa and Sally have carried their infatuation from the original story into a committed lesbian relationship here. Richard, a tortured and reluctant soul, finds himself a character confronting AIDS and pondering the direction of his life while still seemingly obsessed with Clarissa. Clarissa's daughter is again pursued for her youth and vitality by both old and angry lesbians seeking her energy. The party begins the day but in Cunningham's novel the ending arrives quite differently. Cunningham writes beautifully and captures a whisper of Woolf as he goes along to reveal how "Mrs. Dalloway," may have went about her day had she experienced this age. Cunningham guides us between his three stories always sure to connect them in some seemingly insignificant way that is actually hauntingly real.While I fully believe Cunningham's work here can stand on its own I also believe it is enhanced with a familiarity to Virginia Woolf's original story. As a reader I did not grasp all of the intricacies of Cunningham's novel until I had read Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway," and then re-read Cunningham, only then was I able to understand just where Cunningham's ideas stemmed from and fully marveled at his talent. But no matter how you read between the lines this novel is well worth the hours spent within its pages.

I happened to catch this documentary as I was reading &quot;My Life&quot; by Bill Clinton, it brought to life all of the hustle and bustle of his first Presidental campaign.The real people involved in Clinton's first campaign for President are better characters than most actors. James Carville and George Stephanopoulos are the main focus of this film and they are true heroes. Clinton has moments where he shows all of his Southern charm but the real workhorses are Carville and Stephanopoulos who brave polls, reporters and other anti-Clinton politicians. It is an insiders view on how a campaign is won or lost behind the scenes just as easily as in front of all America. But is does make you question if the person who ends up in office is all they are cracked up to be or just a puppet pulled by the strings attached to his campaign managers.A great film to watch if you love politics or if you are reading Bill Clinton's book. It gives an honest representation of how the wheels spin and the tides change at a moments notice. This film will convince you that political campaigns are calculated almost as professionally as a war and can take on the same persona.

The second film in George Romero's cult zombie classics is &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. We are transported to the after affects of the zombie invasion from the first film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and see that chaos has taken over where order no longer exists.The zombies become target practice for rednecks and society loses its grip. From this chaos a few escape by helicopter, a couple of SWAT guys (one black of course!), a wimpy nerd who oozes fear, his feeble girlfriend, and you know the rest.....So these people take over a shopping mall and have a blast living in free luxury until the zombies figure out a way into their secure compound. Then all hell breaks loose!!Sometimes comical, gruesome and even remotely possible (without the zombies of course), this movie captures the essense of what drives Americans, control, survival, material possesions, freedom, democracy and FEAR!! Look for all the nuances and don't be surprised what you find. Romero is known for his political understatements. This is a must for all you fellow zombie fans...so cuddle up and scream!!

It seems the butterfly effect is alive and dancing in Paris as portrayed in this sweet French film.Audrey Tautou is her usual brilliant self as a young girl who sets out on a Metro one day, for work, only to have her entire life change because of the actions of other people. Tautou loses her job and the day spirals into more of the same leaving her deflated and without hope, but on her way out of Paris things begin to change and another great French film is born.This film is filled with a cast of interesting characters who manage to change and shape the lives of the strangers around them. A dirty bum falls at someone's feet, a married man bases his decision to tell his wife on a skipping stone, chocolate and coffee even have their own distinct roles.Mixed within all of the sweetness of this film is the subtle message of cause and affect. In the matter of a day each and every person causes a reaction based upon their own actions. It is an interesting concept to ponder because it shows how the world is tied together as one whether we like it or not. But the best thing about this movie is that it conveys the fact that even on our worst days, where nothing seems to go right, we all have something interesting waiting for us around the bend and under the watchful eye of a bright full moon that shines the world over.

Despite the sensationalism of this film back in the 90's in remains a classic murder mystery with many twists and turns which only add to the suspense. It actually is a very well written movie and has more to offer than a few naked bodies.It begins with a psychiatric tragedy and a psychiatrist who begins to doubt his ability after one of his patients dies. Dr. Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) heads for Los Angeles and some rest at the home of his friend Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula). Within a few short days Dr. Capa's life is tossed upside down and he finds himself involved in a murder mystery, a new affair and working again with a crazy group of patients. But soon the patients begin to disappear and slowly an interesting sequence of events reveals a plot filled with all sorts of surprises.Bruce Willis is interesting in his role as Dr. Capa; he has a bit more to do in this role than just action shots. Jane March is wonderful and maybe a bit confusing for some. Together the pair work well and manage to pull off their parts decently despite taking off their clothes quiet often as well. Lesley Ann Warren plays a great neurotic obsessed with her sexuality. Ruben Blades offers a bit of hilarity as a cop bent on solving a mystery despite the complications and Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif and Kevin J. O'Connor round out the remaining patients each with a distinct personality disorder. Overall this picture is well cast and is capable of holding your attention in one way or another. I found the story to be very well thought out and even surprising. So depending on what your favorite color happens to be you will probably find it somehow woven into this complicated film.

This remark of an original 1973 biography of Sheriff Buford Pusser falls far from the original but has some redeeming qualities.The Rock (Chris Vaughan) manages to pull off a decent role in this film as a man returning to his home town only to find it corrupted by drug dealers and a bought off police force. In typical macho bravado this movie contains more fight scenes than dialogue but at least the fight scenes are worth the wait. The Rock is definitely not someone any normal person would mess with! But playing his nemesis effectively is Neal McDonough who has the act of evil down pat. The story is pretty basic but interesting enough to sustain a film that only lasts 75 minutes. Humor is inflected throughout this movie by the incomparable Johnny Knoxville who plays a bumbling deputy trying to live up to The Rock's ability in a physical sense.Overall if you like action movies this is a decent bit of entertainment. It will definitely inspire a bit of "whoop-ass" and integrity as it begs to attack the power and seduction of drugs being filtered down to our children. The Rock pulls off a better than average performance here but I would have preferred the story had it stuck to the original heroic tale.

"The Observation Deck" is a cute boxed set from Naomi Epel for writers who suffer from writers block or other inspiration malfunctions.The set from Epel contains 50 cards meant to inspire thoughts, stories or other ways of thinking during the writing process. A little book is also included that contains techniques that have worked for other writers such as "Eavesdrop" a little trick apparently used by famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty and many others. The book is more effective than the cards and I would like to see that thought continued in larger volume by Epel.This set is a nice handy tool to have at hand when doubting your worth as a writer. Grab it for inspiration but rely on your own observations.

I am not a person who normally reads the raving bestsellers, mostly because I have been disappointed in the past when I do read them. &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; was described to be out of the ordinary and received such outlandish praise that I jumped aboard the fan wagon.Alice Sebold is a &quot;lovely&quot; writer and worth reading, her subject matter is unfortunately real and she approaches &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; from an interesting point of view....that of a girl recently raped and murdered and telling her saga from heaven. Thankfully this novel is not another slapped together version of something that gets written about over and over again. This novel broke through! However I do feel it was rather tame and toned down to meet the masses as most &quot;bestsellers&quot; are.&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is an easy read despite the horrible character delimma. It is gripping and well written but not unforgettable. I almost wish this novel had been allowed to stand on its own and not become an over-edited version of itself. But then maybe this subject matter needs to be presented to wider audiences and discussed in detail so that the impact of child kidnap and molestation becomes a &quot;bestseller&quot; as a cause.

This movie is a perfect choice if you enjoy dark comedy and nuanced pranks it will appeal to your senses, in many ways offering numerous stabs at the supposed greatness of wealth and "the grass is always greener" theory.Two co-workers drive to work everyday in their daily stupor each suggesting stupid ideas on how to get rich. Jack Black is toned down in his role as the man who invents a way to eliminate doggy waste and his sad side kick, played by Ben Stiller, sort of wallows in his waste. The two friends develop different personalities as they experience success and the inevitable jealousy of the left behind. Black and Stiller are great together darkly conveying the excesses of human nature to a tee. Their wives (Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz) are just as crazy and succumb to the pull of a padded paycheck. As Black increases his wealth and fame Stiller and his family sulk in despair and desire what exists on the other side. Offering further comic relief is Christopher Walken as a conniving homeless man who befriends Stiller at one of his lowest moments.While this film isn't a laugh out loud fest it is entertaining in a subtle way. Anyone who passes a mansion and wishes for what it contains can relate to the understated stabs at the principles of the wealthy and the wake they leave in their pompous paths. Both Black and Stiller are perfect at pretending to be serious while simmering with dark laughter. The lesson found in this film is one of American excess, fast, furious and often coming from crap only to fail the system that brought it to existence in the first place. So don't be too envious when the grass grows a little greener we all need a little fertilizer now and then.

Wow......Charlize Theron is brilliant in this film with her portrayal of &quot;serial killer&quot; Aileen Wuornos. Theron not only manages to completely change her looks but her entire persona, she becomes Wuornos, capturing all of the mannerisms and deep bedded anger that Wuornos exhibited during her trial. Theron's acting is fantastic and through her performance many questions are raised, some that will stay with you for awhile.Christina Ricci should not be ignored in her performance in this film either. She captures naive innocence in her role as Wuornos's girlfriend. Ricci's emotions are raw and she holds her own against Theron's brilliance.But this film is really more than just the acting; it is a statement about right and wrong and about the justice of our death penalty. I don't think anyone can walk away from this film and not feel that Wuornos might have deserved a different sentence. While I agree she was wrong to kill her victims I have to wonder what any normal woman might do under her circumstances. Rape is almost as brutal as death despite the lack of permanence. After seeing the life Wuornos had to live I became wracked with compassion for a woman with no place to turn. Was she right to kill? No! But at what point is a person a cold blooded murderer and at what point is she crushed by her circumstances. At some point blame needs to rest with the child abusers, rapists and sexual predators that helped to create Wuornos and others likely to come in her wake. This film will really cause you to reflect on where you stand on issues like this.

The previews for this movie looked funny but sadly the film itself is worthless and the real joke arrives at the expense of racial stereotypes gone extreme.I imagine if this movie had the direction of someone experienced in gag reels it would have stood a chance. The concept is funny but sadly it caters to the idea that all people of "soul" are cool, overly sexual and ready to get up and dance the moment a bass makes its first BOOM, while white people are the inevitable nerds with tight behinds and no rhythm and I won't even mention other anatomy differences. While the stereotypes might be funny if referenced once in a while they are definitely not funny when the mention is constant and just irritating. Both races deserve a bit more class here. I enjoy a good laugh, even at my own expense, but I just couldn't make it through this one.I believe this movie is geared towards 20ish boys who find racial humor hilarious and the idea of a hip-hop plane conceivable. Women should be offended that the filmmakers have lowered their standards to just being a strip show without any real substance. Get a refund for your ticket and take another plane!

Interesting......with a bit of a twist to keep it so!Johnny Depp plays a depressed writer living alone in a cabin while going through a divorce due to his wife's affair. Depp is very convincing as the loner in the wilderness, taking days to sleep and walking about in a tattered robe, while letting his hair go wild. His character is completely likable and throughout the film you somehow hope for a better existence for this down on his luck guy. He crosses paths with a few eerie characters played by John Turturro and Timothy Hutton, both actors effective in their individual roles as well.I was surprised to find out that this film is an adaptation of something Stephen King wrote because usually I find the King books un-complimented by their movie versions. However I found this film to be along the lines of something Hitchcock would have mastered. The story is interesting and the movie moves along most of the time without much effort. The great surprise for me was that I didn't have the film figured out in the end; I like movies with those kinds of mysterious secrets!

After watching this movie I am even more convinced that the original "American Pie" film was a fluke....it worked....the other's in the series suffer from trying way too hard.This film has all of the usual actors in their roles with Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan on their way to the altar. So while the women plan a wedding the "men" run around town still in search of sexual pleasure in all of its most inane of forms. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is full of his typical gross antics, this time with dogs, dog waste and a focus upon the only thing he seems capable of understanding.....sex. While most of the silliness and surprise of the original "Pie" film worked that same vulgar effort misses sorely in this film, basically just grossing people out with the worst of gags and a really stupid and entirely gratuitous T&A; scene that could have easily been thrown on the editing floor.The filmmakers were smart enough to stay with Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush as the parents who birthed all of these nincompoops! The humor found in the older actors is the only redeeming quality of this movie. Maybe on the next "American Divorce," something will change!

This quirky project from the outrageously funny Coen Brothers will confuse you at first but leave you with a great appreciation for Southern stereotypes and Gospel music.Tom Hanks stars in this film about an old-fashioned southern professor and his band of goons as they try to steal a stash of cash from a moored river barge. Hanks looks like a Mississippi gentleman complete with crisp white linen suit and a Colonel Sanders beard. In this role Hanks is absorbed in all the refinement and politeness of the South, capturing the accent with perfection. He rents a room from the religious and proper Irma P. Hall, who is incredible as the proud God-fearing woman that lends her root cellar to Hanks' "renaissance" band, despite being oblivious to what is really taking place. Marlon Wayans, Garth Pancake and Tzi Ma complete the peculiar criminal package and they all bumble their way into a hilarious farce about Southern rights and wrongs. With a background of great Gospel music that becomes its own character you will walk away from this movie kicking up your heels.The Coen Brothers have remade this original 1955 film and they have done a superb job. While this movie isn't nearly as crazy as their other pictures it offers a very unique look at the South finding humor in all sorts of places. Everyone will want Irma P. Hall as their mother because she is so infectious in her role here. Make sure to watch the bonus material and the full Gospel productions by the choir; I guarantee you won't be able to watch them just once. A great message is found in this film, unexpectedly and possibly unintended, that the faithful always rise above.

If you loved Helen Fielding's novel you will find both similarities and differences in the film version of her story. I have to admit I laughed harder reading the novel than while watching the film but I found the movie endearing in its own right.Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a bumbling British woman who at the age of 30 or so has decided that she is turning into a spinster. Her friends and family make every effort to find her a mate but only end up embarrassing her more than she is capable of on her own. Jones is secretly in love with her hunky but totally unavailable boss (Hugh Grant) and spends an enormous amount of time trying to get his attention. Along the way she meets a family acquaintance Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and they play back and forth at a serious stab at a relationship. All the while Jones writes down in a red diary all of the escapades she encounters as well as her obsession with her weight thus leaving a trail of words in her wake that could come back to bite her.Renee Zellweger has successfully managed to become British for her role as Bridget Jones. Much has been made about her weight in this movie but in reality she is still slimmer than the average American woman even though she is supposed to possess "enormous underwear" Zellweger has excellent comic skills and hits this character on the head but unfortunately the director left some of Helen Fielding's funniest written scenes out of this movie. Hugh Grant is perfect as a cad but somehow still lovable. Colin Firth is so appealing as Mark Darcy and the friction between him and Zellweger works as beautifully as a romantic comedy should. Overall this movie is fun and entertaining capturing all of the awkwardness felt by those of us who never quite fit into this world so bent on perfection and leaving us with someone else to laugh at besides ourselves for a change.

This movie is a sweet and sometimes touching holiday treat for the whole family with a touch of hilarity and a little sadness it could be added to any holiday collection.Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's (Ed Asner) bag as a baby and is eventually adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). Buddy grows up making toys for Santa but never quite gets up to the speed of the other elves and after trying a few odd jobs at the Pole he overhears the fact that he is really a human being and not an elf. This sets Buddy off on a search for his real human father in New York City. Buddy does his best to snuggle up to his father Walter (James Caan) and his step-mother Emily (Mary Steenburgen) while having a hard time dealing with all of the harsh chaos of human life.This film is a sweet portrayal of a human being brought up among elves in the faultlessness of Santa's home. It takes an innocent, positive person and places them right in the middle of all the negative human behaviors that seem to be magnified during the happiest of holidays. It places a smile back on the faces of anyone who lost the magic of Christmas and the joy of Santa Claus. And it definitely makes you look at your own attitude towards the people you "love" and care about while sadly showing all of the lost virtue of humanity. With Will Ferrell cast as the childlike elf it never ceases to be funny but some of the gags are a little far stretched...especially the burping scene! James Caan is great as the shut down, stressed-out and angry father. And who could forget Ed Asner as Santa! Overall a great message stems from this Christmas movie and you might even find yourself hoping for one last meeting with Santa Claus before your heart freezes over for good.

I have placed this film as one of my favorite films of all time because it works on so many levels. This film is visually stunning, musically magical, written beautifully and is most importantly a powerful message about how life was during the 1864 battle of Petersburg, Virginia.The cast in this movie is fantastic, not one of the actors fails in their role and combined these brilliant actors weave together a phenomenal tale of the harshness of life on "Cold Mountain." Nicole Kidman is a beautiful, educated city girl who has moved to the country with her pastor father, played by Donald Sutherland. Kidman represents purity and the ultimate in feminine weakness as expected during the 1800's, she can look fresh and pretty, play beautiful music, read and speak French but she was never taught anything else. As the movie advances Kidman adapts to her changing role and is absolutely convincing in her strength as a woman during a time when the least was expected of one. Kidman falls for a character played by Jude Law and a great love story unfolds in the midst of war. Jude Law's character plays at war but never becomes convinced of its value towards humanity so he pays a very high price. Although the love story in this film is touching and emotionally significant I found it paled in comparison to the heroic efforts found in the side story.Renee Zellweger is a central character to this film and pulls off an excellent performance as the tough and robust country woman who saves Kidman's farm. Zellweger transforms herself into a woman who verges on manhood, gritty and absolutely unfeminine for the time period, but she is the perfect savior next to Kidman and with her role makes a great statement about the worthiness of women during the era. Many other actors make brief but powerful appearances starting with Eileen Atkins, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, and others. Each supporting character strengthens the story and is found to have a reason for being cast in the film rather than just appearing at random.This film is directed by Anthony Minghella and he has done an excellent job bringing to life the harshness of life during the war of 1864 in Virginia, he captures the beauty that surrounds all of the hate and shows how nature has its own hand at what unfolds. Minghella brings forth the message that women were nothing without men to support them but that the strong ones managed to survive when they were willing to take on the additional burdens of "manhood" while their men were being killed at war. The hatred and prejudice of the time is handled with intense scenes of slaves being killed, families being tortured and with realistically impressive war depictions. Minghella creates paintings with almost every shot. So often epic sagas such as this one fail because the expectations run high but I could find nothing in this film that failed, it is simply amazing.

I watched the movie &quot;Chocolat&quot; a year or so ago and found myself amazed at the sensuality of this little story. So I decided to read the book although I felt I knew the story.Joanne Harris is a brilliant story teller with such admiration for the senses that she pulls her readers into a land of sensory overload where you want to reside forever. The book is different than the movie (isn't this always the case?) but just as entertaining. The delicate prose and romantic verse keep you interested until the very end and then for days and days afterwards. I dare you to read this tale and not find yourself sipping wine and cocoa while being tempted by all the chocolate. France will be calling your name!

Ahhh the holidays....that wonderful time of thankfulness, love and laughter, NOT!!! This movie will have you in stitches each and every holiday season if you suffer from that ever present disease of dysfunctional family syndrome.Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) is wallowing in self-pity for good reason, she was fired from her job, her daughter is about to have sex for the first time and she is traveling back home for the holidays. What more could a girl ask for, a cold? She arrives to a snowy existence and a family of little understanding. Her father Henry (Charles Durning) and her mother Adele (Anne Bancroft) are seemingly oblivious to all of the turmoil they have created and that now resides within their children. Soon the house is filled with love and lots of arguments! Gay brother Tommy Larson (Robert Downey Jr.) appears to torture the entire clan with mischief and in tow he has a co-worker/friend, Leo Fish (Dylan McDermott). And of course what family would be complete without the crazy aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a branch of perfection that breaks off and becomes the norm, sister Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson) and her [...] husband Walter (Steve Guttenberg). So sit back and have a toast with a perfectly normal American family for the holidays but get ready to laugh uncontrollably too!Jodie Foster directed this film about the typical dysfunctional family during the holiday season and she brings both a sensitive understanding and a full blown sense of humor to this holiday table. Holly Hunter is really wonderful as the hopeful but often misunderstood sister in a clan of crazies. Despite his drug induced performance, Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the troubled brother with secrets to protect from a family that can't accept modern life. Dylan McDermott is the pretty boy of the film but offers much more than a cute mug in his role as the charming outsider. Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft are brilliant as clueless parents who are stuck in the roles they took upon themselves many years ago; both are unknowingly hilarious just like most parents who prefer to keep their eyes closed. Cynthia Stevenson is great as the perfectionist sister that seems to lurk about in every family and marries a nerd so that she can pretend to be happy. But the true scene stealer of this film has to be Geraldine Chaplin as crazy but oblivious Aunt Gladys, you cannot watch her performance and not fall on the floor in hysterics! Overall this is the perfect holiday movie to bring good cheer where little may truly exist.....after all if you can't laugh at yourself what is the point in holiday reunions, isn't that what brings us back home year after year?

This film is actually presented as a play with chalkboard homes and an entire invisible town created on a soundstage but it is still an indispensable look into the psyche of humanity.The town of Dogville exists during the depression era and is nestled deep into the Rocky Mountains, away from prying eyes and the influence of "civil" society. It is here that we meet Grace (Nicole Kidman) a mysterious woman who stumbles into town looking for acceptance. The moral influence of the town is Tom (Paul Bettany) and it is in him that Grace seeks refuge. The townspeople are presented with a dilemma to harbor a so-called fugitive or to take pity on a woman running from a fearful past. At first the people shun this mysterious woman but soon find her handy at chores and useful to some extent. As with all human nature Grace is soon exploited because she is weak and at the mercy of the strong, her services used and trodden upon and soon the beginnings of destruction stand firmly in Dogville. The ending is justice and vindication based on the need of all humanity for revenge and a violent end to an unfair situation.This film is intriguing in its message and theory on what exists in the heart of man. Directed brilliantly by Lars von Trier it all seems strange at first until the truth is somehow brought into play. Nicole Kidman is phenomenal as the mysterious woman who becomes the town stepping stone at the sake of her true character. Paul Bettany is perfect as the town philosopher who steers the sleepy inconspicuous town into trouble. The townspeople are played with precision by such great actors as Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazzara along with many other talented individuals. This film is something original and profound with an ability to strike a cord with any society. The story is narrated by John Hurt and the writing is visionary and powerful.If you like films that make you think this one will do it. In this movie you may find bits and pieces of your worst self as well. It isn't a light hearted look at a small town but rather a study on how man literally becomes as uncivilized as a pack of dogs given the right prey.

After hearing about this film for years I am happy to see it remastered and now on DVD. Indulge yourself in this basket of sweetness because the message Fellini conveys is significant.This film was originally made in 1961 during a time when experimentation was the rage. The movie reflects all that life was during that decade and sadly shows that we haven't grown much as a society since we still fall for immediate gratification. The magnificent Marcello Mastroianni stars as "Marcello," a successful tabloid reporter who finds himself revolving in and around high society in Rome. Within Marcello's heart lurks a deeper fervor, but that passion falls to the seduction of excess. His dream to seriously write gives way to the lure of wealth and fame. Marcello wanders around in dream like sequences where he encounters people of all sorts, all unhappy and drowning in overindulgence. Marcello is loved by Emma (Yvonne Furneaux) but it is a love that exists on the verge of an urgent madness and drives him away. He uses Maddalena (Anouk Aimee) as his divergence and becomes convinced that sex is as powerful as he feels love is confining, but Maddalena is empty and her attentions easily swayed. It is inevitable that Marcello falls for the great American moviestar, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), while trying to rescue her from the paparazzi and her abusive moviestar boyfriend. In the end Marcello discovers his life to be shallow and insignificant and as ugly as a washed up sea creature only to find the appeal of life in the youthful vigor of a young girl's wave.Fellini is a master at the art of filmmaking confirming the art of his mind with this complex yet extraordinary look at life. His vision can be confusing and even considered misleading if watched with a closed and shallow mind. Look for all the subtle nuances he leaves in his scenes such as the cleansing water of a fountain, the finality of a dead fish, and the gentle exuberant wave of youth. The actors in this film are outstanding conveying a sense of boredom and fear as they go about their indulgences. The smiles and laughter of a drunk only hide a painful reality and Fellini captures the losses with an insightful ability. This film allows you to delve into your own shallow areas of life, the passionate ups and the despairing downs, but if you live right you can walk away smiling knowing that life is certainly sweeter once you learn from your mistakes.

After hearing what the critics had to say about this movie I expected the worst. While I agree it isn't the greatest movie ever made it certainly has some retaining qualities.Jennifer Lopez, playing a lesbian hit woman, does a really good job on this project. She is deep, thoughtful and sensitive but understandably hiding behind a tougher exterior. Her character is the soul of the movie. Certain scenes are rather erotic but in a necessary effort to explain the beauty of sex to a less than qualified man, who happens to be played by Ben Affleck. In the scene on the yoga mat Lopez is seductive and enticing but speaking with poetic justice about the differences between the sexes and sex. Lopez grounds the movie by keeping her leading man from acting violently and continuously attempting to find some depth somewhere down inside what appears to be just another shallow hitman.Ben Affleck is alright in this movie, not much more can really be said. His character is tough and impatient but somehow Affleck doesn't quite have what it takes to pull it off. When he sticks to the sensitive scenes and when he starts to show his love for Lopez's character he becomes more real and some depth in his portrayal can be found.The star of this film is in my opinion is Justin Bartha who plays a mentally challenged young man who is kidnapped by Ben and Jen. Bartha personifies the innocence and inexhaustible curiosity of the mentally challenged with great skill. He masters the lyrics of rap songs, has a religious obsession with Baywatch and loves to dance making most of his scenes quite entertaining.So watch it.....it is worth a few hours and won't stay with you forever. The ending is touching and many scenes show a nice blend of compassion and romance. Don't miss Al Pacino, of course, who never has a bad scene! Take the time to make up your own mind about this one.

Love him or hate him Michael Moore really puts it all out there in this film. But one must watch it with an open and honest mind to grasp its true value to America.After months of anticipation and media hype (most of it bad) I couldn't wait to watch this DVD. I will say that one should watch this film after having formed their own opinion because I imagine it has the ability to make up the mind of the entirely clueless. Moore portrays President Bush as an arrogant bumbling idiot without one good quality. Personally I don't believe that to be so but I also have a healthy perspective on where his administration has erred America as well. Every one can be filmed during their worst moments and made to look foolish so the scenes filmed by Moore about President Bush didn't impress me. I don't believe ANYONE could have known how to react on 9/11 and not look foolish, we all paid a price on that day that shouldn't be mocked, it is history and that day will never be changed it is only our futures that stand a chance. I believe this film will force you to get involved, to take a stand and to care how America is represented, the fog has been lifted and now we are all responsible.This film does not get interesting, unless you like to "Bushbash," until the Iraq war comes into play. We see children playing on swing sets and women going to market, Iraqi smiles and laughter and then BOOM! For people who have chosen to watch the war only through the eyes of our popular media this film will open your eyes to a truth really too horrible for any of us to imagine. Moore manages to show the devastation that Iraq has felt because of American decisions. Their blood drips on each and every one of us especially our precious soldiers. It is important to realize here that the poor and uneducated are fighting the same. An effective moment in this film is when Moore attempts to recruit the children of American congressmen for service in Iraq.....and the answer is? As for our soldiers they are trained to kill, asked to kill and faced with death every day something unfathomable to imagine dealing with. Moore presents the difficulties that our soldiers face in Iraq as well as the abuses that Iraqis are suffering. The footage is not easy to get through without feeling touched and often ashamed. Watching a mother read a letter from her son killed in battle is almost impossible to endure but we must in order for it all to change. Regardless of your political beliefs allow this film to affect you!This DVD has many very interesting "extras" that further the horror of what is taking place before the world's eyes in Iraq. But what can be done? Moore is doing something, taking a stand is doing something, developing compassion is doing something and asking questions is doing something. The only bad question is the one not asked! Moore asks and even answers many questions with this extraordinary film. The fact that it was accepted so well internationally must mean something. Like it or not being a proud American doesn't just stop at our own borders, our pride exists in the universe as well and maybe after watching this film that fact will matter. Allow your temperature to rise with knowledge and compassion and realize that the answer cannot and must not be found in hate.

This movie is an interesting docudrama about the last years of F. Scott Fitzgerald as he was writing "The Last Tycoon."Starring as F. Scott Fitzgerald is award winning actor Jeremy Irons. While I have the greatest respect for Irons as an actor I just didn't feel he pulled off this part. Irons has an evilness that seems to hang around his characters and Fitzgerald never struck me as evil only severely flawed and tempted. So the brooding and self-deprecating Irons never allowed the vulnerability of Fitzgerald to shine through in this role, but he sure plays a mean drunk.Neve Campbell plays Fitzgerald's faithful and infatuated secretary, Frances. Campbell is pretty good in this role but cowers against the strength of Irons at times. She pulls off the period well conforming enough to the standards of women working during the late 30's. Also appearing off and on as a negative force in the film is Sissy Spacek as Zelda Fitzgerald. I thought the film would have been much more interesting with a little more Spacek and some of Zelda's drama.I enjoyed this film only because it provided a bit of an inside look into the downfall of the great F. Scott Fitzgerald. It always seems that the greatest minds of artistic people suffer from exactly what makes them brilliant, a very vivid imagination that ends up haunting them into a deep black hole.

This is a great character film expanding the lives of four young girls from the good old 70's decade and stirring up a lot of old memories.The film starts with the adult versions of the four girls played by Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson as they come together for a reunion for the birth of Wilson's child. Not much has changed! O'Donnell has become a doctor, Griffith a movie star, Moore a writer and Wilson a pink and perky mother to be. This film allows us all to discover how these women came to be and it is actually pretty insightful. So sit back and take yourself on an "old school" journey back in time.Soon enough this movie goes back in time to the early 70's when kids could ride bikes all over town, ice cream sodas were the rage, AM radios hung on every handlebar, laughter hung in the air and stories were meant to be told. The young O'Donnell is played by Christina Ricci, a tough tomboy growing up in a family of men because her mother was killed. Ricci is the strong one, the shoulder to cry on, the fighter who would rather play sports than sprout a couple of breasts. Griffith is portrayed as a young girl by Thora Birch and as a youth is fascinated early by sex, fake breasts and being an actress. Birch is the adventurer, the wandering heart and the heartbreaker of the group. Moore's child is played by Gaby Hoffman and she is the quiet, introspective and questioning young girl. Hoffman gets herself in all sorts of dilemmas stemming from the shame of divorced parents who act more like children than she does. Finally Wilson is played by Ashleigh Aston Moore, and of all the girls she remains steadfastly the same in adulthood as in youth, a simple, rather innocent girl surrounded by a perfectionist mother (played by Bonnie Hunt!) and an entire room of pink and lacy curtains.The young girls are shown growing up and daring the world, finding where they all belong and how they are alike yet very different. The film brings back great memories of the time through the use of great music and ties to certain events that impacted the generation. The happiness and innocence of the decade is found on the country roads and soda shops as the girls plan their adventures. Silly crushes and fights with boys are inevitable along with all the challenges of growing up imperfect. All of the fun of childhood is represented here, the cemetery s&eacute;ances, tree-house meetings, excursions on bicycles, splashes in the river, sneaking out the bedroom window at night and childhood friendships that should last a lifetime. I found this film inspiring and insightful, but then I came from the same generation so I can totally relate. So I watch it every now and then for the sweetness and the memories of a great childhood.

Ilene Segalove and Paul Bob Velick have several books of lists where one explores their deepest self in a fun and imaginative way.&quot;List You Self&quot; is terrific fun and amazingly revealing. Each page offers a prompt and requires you to jot down a list of responses, this is best done without alot of thought because the immediate answers are the most honest. You will be asked to divulge to yourself your inner most passions, dreams and fears along with people that you find heroic or as mentor qualifiers along with many other exciting areas of exploration. The most enjoyable prompts take you back in time to old memories and favorite times.I enjoy these &quot;list&quot; books as a way to get to know myself but I also see the value in these books as a way to leave behind something interesting about yourself. Parents, Grandparents and even some children could have hours of entertainment completing the lists provided while stirring up old treasured memories along the way.

This documentary is an interesting concept, throw 150 video cameras at a population of people in a war torn country and see what they have to say.....like I said its interesting.If you can get beyond watching a bunch of amateurs trying to film their lives this film really has some important information contained within it. Over a course of several months video cameras were distributed throughout Iraq and passed from person to person in hopes of obtaining a realistic look at what life is like in Iraq today. Although I found this movie quite intriguing I also question the editing.....in 90 minutes of film there is only a stray comment here and there showing any negative view of the American occupation. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the smiles and laughter from Iraqi children and hearing that most of the people included on this film were very pro-American but I am not convinced it is a true representation of Iraq today. In America, a democracy and a country of peace, we can't even agree between neighbors on who should run our own country so to try and sell a war torn country as a happy go lucky nation with only one opinion about its future I just found it to be a very hard sell. If it were all true then Americans would not still be getting killed in an effort to establish democracy, it would automatically exist and be agreed upon.Some of the clips incorporated into this film show insurgent ads that are geared towards recruitment of people opposing the war in Iraq. These people were not given video cameras and probably for a good reason! But if this film is to be the "voice" of a new democracy shouldn't all voices be counted? Don't tell me Iraq will be colored red and blue too.....for true democracy and peace to exist someone, somewhere has to agree on something, right? This film definitely shows the brutality of the Saddam regime with a few clips that are downright brutal. I have no doubt that many Iraqis are thrilled to have their horrible dictator out of power but I just can't see anyone agreeing with bombs, poverty and mass confusion on a daily basis....it has to affect a person with more than a smile! I would have been more impressed with this film had the producers chosen to show a more honest representation of the true Iraq it seems to me that after all they have been through they deserve better and they certainly deserve a chance to speak with a honest mind rather than a voice covered in red.

This film is edgy and incredibly imperfect, it bounces around in time and begins where it ends but there is a method to the madness.In every life a stranger's actions may reflect our future at any given moment and this film brings together three lives and three families as no other. It begins with the ending, an unexplained moment that makes no sense and seems entirely insignificant until the end. We find a cynical almost self-loathing man in need of an organ transplant, he sits alone in a room waiting to die or be given life through another's death. Another core character is a busy mom who bakes a cake with her girls but hides her deepest secrets from her family. The driving force in the film is an ex-con who covers his anger by representing a born again Christian to the outside world. The film takes these main characters and twists and turns back and forth through time revealing the past and presenting glimpses of the future as it rolls slowly along. It is difficult to get through but worth the effort once all of the scenes are eventually tied together.The actors in this film deserved more attention for their roles. Sean Penn is the ailing professor and puts his all into the struggle of this man's life. Penn is perfect as the seriously conflicted man managing to always be flawless in such challenging roles. Naomi Watts is the seemingly happy young mother but soon changes face as tragedy disrupts her protected world and Watts decays into a different character. Watts is brilliant next to Penn and is not even close to suffocating in his turmoil; she brings her own agony right back and does it extremely well. Finally Benecio Del Toro is superb as the flawed ex-con trying to control his future by a false faith. Del Toro is anguish! He always brings something extra to his roles. Adding to the fantastic acting of these individuals is the way that the director filmed this movie. The actors are filmed in a gritty light that sticks in each and every facial imperfection and traces the tragedy of their lives. The actor's skin is sallow and almost gray, with dark circles under their eyes and grimy fingernails clasping cigarettes in most of the scenes. If you are looking for pretty this isn't it! But the filmmakers deepen the tragedy of the characters with this unique technique somehow.The message that extends from this gritty film is that our lives intersect with many others through a series of events and that one bad decision can off shoot into a million others. With all of the people we pass by unconsciously everyday it may make you wary or it may make you aware of the impact your life has in the world. The message is clear and the writer/director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has managed to convey his worth to the world in an amazingly unique and profound way. The weight of this film is more than a few grams and Inarrito has carved himself a brilliant future.

George Sand lived larger than many lives today during a time when women were cattle and broodmares she managed to enforce the beginnings of feminism upon French society.Born Aurora Dupin, George Sand changed her name to that of a man so that she could write and earn a living during 19th century France, by doing so she made herself as famous for her lifestyle and character as for her writings. Sand is explained as an extraordinarily complex woman who refuses to stay in a box that denies her freedom. She explores passion and sexual escapades with such renowned figures as, Alfred Musset, Chopin, Liszt, Flaubert and many others not so well known. Sand laughed in society's face and stunned them all with her outrageous take on life becoming one of the world's first feminists, defending the rights of women in marriage and in a masculine culture. Sand walked around Paris alone, dressed in men's clothing and assumed herself to be free of the stigmas most women cowered to; for this Sand must be acknowledged and Belinda Jack has accomplished that in this interesting biography of Sand's life.Belinda Jack writes well but tends to stick to many facts and less description. She keeps this biography geared on Sand and her accomplishments rather than the scandals that most people place their attentions on. Sand is explained as a child who grew up conflicted on status and her place in life, through this she appears capable of staying on the outside of society and becoming a great observer of human nature and character. It is said that Sand had so many relationships because she needed inspiration for her stories. Jack writes about the connection Sand has to animals and nature, to philosophical ideologies and religious teachings and interestingly enough it seems that Sand felt guided to art because she felt that the magnificence of God existed within the creation of beauty. Sand's approach to life seems to fit into modern society rather than the one she was born into and we can only imagine what an extraordinary woman she would be today had she lived in this century. One of my favorite lines in the book is, "Not to be noticed as a man, one has first to be used to not being noticed as a woman."George Sand is astonishing and a true rebel against the machine that tries to hold individuals back from independent thought. This biography brings to light the struggle of women and George Sand overcomes it by portraying a man with more depth and compassion than the lesser gender has ever been capable of. It seems that Sand was so often bored in her relationships because the men lacked her strength and although she was not considered a proper beauty her talented personality and search for freedom was what caused her to be the ultimate femme fatale! Sand's life is worth celebrating and Belinda Jack has done an excellent job in bringing this shining light back into existence.

Frances Mayes has written a beautiful memoir about her home in Tuscany. Along with Mayes you experience all of the crazy unsettling ups and downs of purchasing a home abroad and attempting to renovate it on American time.Both humerous and faithful to Tuscan life this book inspires new life, new dreams and new hope even in the deadest of hearts. Mayes will leave you hungry physically and emotionally for a life well lived. She introduces characters who adapt to the whims of an American woman with no idea of how Tuscan life really works until she becomes absorbed in her new life and home.The book is FAR better than the movie and the recipes included will leave your taste buds in heaven. I recommend fresh air, a sip of Tuscan wine, good cheese, olive oil, and a dinner of sage and butter pasta and I believe you will melt into this book like I did.

If you enjoy cabaret singers, lots of makeup and a little choreographed dancing this movie is for you. With lots of Broadway songs and a few silly antics it explores the fun side of a "queen's" life while also delving gently into the difficulties.Connie (Nia Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Colette) are enthusiastic singers living in Chicago when they witness a crime and must find a way to hide from gangsters while still enjoying their lives. They end up in Los Angeles and find themselves masquerading as drag queens. The difficulties arise when they become successful as their alter egos and must maintain their false identities in real life circumstances. Connie hides her feelings for the man of her dreams, Jeff (David Duchovny) while helping him to bond with his own brother who has estranged himself from his family because he felt they would never understand his life in drag. Eventually the games are off but while they last a lot of fun can be had by all.Nia Vardalos is her ever enchanting self in this role and has the opportunity to show off her true Broadway ability along with co-talent Toni Colette. The music and acts are really entertaining and you might even find yourself signing or humming along. Unfortunately the storyline is totally predictable and filled with a few really poor written lines. The best thing about this film however is its exposure of a lifestyle often misunderstood and it manages to show with sensitivity some of the loneliness and estrangement that a drag queen suffers in order to live an authentic life. So despite the simplicity of the script something good comes from all the dramatic effort.....and girlfriend get ready to hum along, snap!!

Rick Bass is one of my favorite writers and in my opinion deserves much more attention.This book is a memoir of his first years in Yaak, Montana with his wife Elizabeth. They move from the city to a small cabin in the Montana wilderness. It is a beautifully written tribute to a world no longer in demand where the sound of silence feels too loud. Bass finds out just how little he actually knows, a marvelous experience in humility, once he encounters the harshness of winter. He writes about snow being strong and silent in the same breath. He discovers a new life where he only needs bare essentials to survive and soon finds that all other existence seems superficial. He writes in a style like no other man I have ever read almost poetic but not overdone, and like Walden, he suggests that tremendous value exists in the wilderness away from a roaring crowd.If you love nature and the idea of healing such as that found in solitude this book is for you. Bass writes so wonderfully that your senses are taken along with him on his various wilderness excursions for life's rations. My favorite passage is on page 81, on which he describes a lone male moose, "He broke into the smoothest of gallops, a lazy, long legged floating. His wide antlers could have held a tea service without spilling a drop, so smooth and level was his gait." How many men do you know who would think of a tea service and not a loaded gun upon seeing a magnificent male moose? This is where I find Rick Bass so appealing; in all his male machismo he finds the subtle intricacies of art in nature and has the ability to describe it all magically.

Peterson has written an excellent report on the atrocities that have taken place under our eyes in Africa. Most Americans know about Somalia from &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; but Peterson reports from a different perspective and brings new light to an old meaning. He reports on what both the UN and the US did wrong while on a &quot;peace mission.&quot; I would have hoped we would have learned our lesson but some aspects Peterson describes ring much too true for our involvement in Iraq as well.The most horrifying account that Peterson writes so vividly about is the genocide in Rwanda. How does a world ignore such atrocity? I cried often during the reading of this section. I can't imagine how any country could ignore the pleading of such a dying nation in such a beautiful part of the world. To read about a man living in a wall for months to avoid being murdered, a child hiding under her parents while they were hacked to death, and see pictures of streets lined with death is beyond understandable. This is where our billions in defense should have gone!I believe this book to be a must read for all humanity. From each horrible account something is learned. Africa is a beautiful country on the verge of catastrophe while the rest of the world ignores its pleas. From such anger, bitterness and hate comes furure generations of the same unless the world steps up with bravery and defends a peaceful solution. A billion dollars of understanding would go alot further in this country than the others we chose to toy with. Peterson has brought the injustices to life masterfully. This book NEEDS to be read by anyone who cares about a global existence and our future.

This journal is beautiful as well as practical. It is full of writing prompts, charts and artwork to inspire true soul work."Soul Catcher" is a guided journal complete with great artwork and journaling suggestions. The writing prompts are easy to relate to and inspiring, this journal begs to be written in. The section on fear and worries is my favorite I found that I could easily work through all sorts of road blocks in the way of my success. Another great section is one dealing with jealousy and obsession those often overlooked success blockers. Who wants to admit they are jealous much less obsessive? At the end of the journal is a recommended reading list that contains great suggestions for further exploration into the psyche.Sometimes a little bit of effort goes a long way. This journal will get you a few steps further than expected. So instead of letting your soul just flounder about why not start to catch it before it sprouts those angel wings.

This film is the perfect love story adding to "Before Sunrise" filmed in 1994 it takes us through the awkwardness of a love so passionately unrequited.In 1994 a little film was made entitled "Before Sunrise" and we met an awkward American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) as he encountered a beautiful exuberant French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy). The original movie took us on a visual journey through Europe starting on a Eurorail and ending with the sunrise in Vienna. The couple agreed to meet in the same place and we were left to wonder what ever happened to this engaging couple and their great banter. Well finally the answer can be found in this updated conversation between Jesse and Celine in of all places, the most romantic city in the world, Paris! Jesse, now a writer, is surprised by Celine during his book signing in Paris. Celine has become an "angry activist" and she still holds a definite opinion about everything under the sun making for yet another fabulous tte-&agrave;-tte. We follow Celine and Jesse through the streets of Paris, sipping coffee at caf&eacute;s, strolling along the Seine and passing through gardens of excellence, eventually ending up at Celine's Parisian apartment.....will it ever end? I for one hope not!Expect nothing short of brilliance from this simple and straight forward film about a couple re-kindling a flame not ready to die. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy maintain a fantastic rhythm throughout this film walking through Paris while having a most interesting conversation. Despite its simplicity in actuality the writing is quite sophisticated and now very grown-up. All of the passion and chemistry from the first film remains between the characters here and I imagine a third film will be on the back burner. All of the great romances always end in Paris but we are left again to wonder if Jesse and Celine will really make it after all. Director Richard Linklater has filmed pure poetry against a perfect romantic backdrop and he will leave you begging for more with or without the sun.

Regardless of the truth behind this book it is a work that is both inspirational and spine-tingling and well worth the read.James Frey depicts his version of events surrounding his drug and alcohol addiction in a heart wrenching rhythm that will leave you breathless even after it is over. Frey's writing style is full blown stream of consciousness and rivals such greats as Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf with its intensity. From page one Frey grabs his readers and the addiction begins. The story is raw and often sickening especially if the reader has ever dealt with the horrors of addiction in any form. However the most amazing aspect of this book is its ability to relate towards raw human emotion and the frailty of human beings when faced with dire circumstances.As for the controversy....I read this book prior to the "outing" of Frey and while I understood it to be a memoir I also could see seeds of elaboration. The fact of the matter is that this book was written by an addict and his memories may or may not be as factual as those sane enough to criticize this piece of work. It felt far fetched to fully believe Frey's story even prior to the controversy but as a reader I was willing to go with the elaboration in order to reap the benefits. Yes it's hard to believe a man with a gaping hole in his face and a blood filled shirt could manage to board a commercial plane but stranger things have happened! The wonderful thing about this book is the suggestion that an individual can find recovery on their own will given the right direction. The "cult" therapy organizations are not the only answer and I applaud Frey for braving his critics in order to express his views on this subject. Any individual can overcome any circumstance if their heart and mind is in the right place....I believe Frey's is. With rare emotion Frey captures finding his center within and without typical beliefs in addiction therapy. Don't shun Frey's work for the slam campaign but rather appreciate his words as the inspiration they were meant to be. The truth of this book remains in what a million other works have never been able to explain....the responsibility lies with the individual. I imagine Frey is fully aware of that fact.

I picked up this book after having visited the graveyards of Paris and falling in love with the artful serenity they exude.At times witty, charming and even historical this little story takes a visit to a French graveyard into a whole other world. Famous people who reside in death at the Pere-Lachaise Cimetiere in Paris are finding theselves reincarnated into stray cats. Bill Richardson is loyal to the original historical figures and allows all their known eccentricities to remain alive within the cats. Alice B. Tolkas pines away for the return of her beloved Gertrude Stein, Jim Morrison is a swaggering sexy tomcat, Fontaine describes the cats with great poetic harmonies, Oscar Wilde falls in love with Morrison, Isadora Duncan still dances in the moonlight with ribbons, Colette still exudes desire, Maria Callas is still quite the diva, Sarah Bernhardt the consummate actress, and Proust becomes a reculsive private eye, just to name a few.I rated this book with only 3 stars because it is a bit complex to read. The style is chaotic, bouncing around from letter, to narration, to poetry and more letters. The writing is littered with uncommon words that leave you feeling ignorant if you don't take the time to look them up. The characters are complex, of course they should be, and halfway through the book I stopped to refresh my memory on who was who before continuing on. I recommend a quickie refresher course on interesting French figures before beginning to read this story only because it allows you to grasp all the subtle nuances as you go along. All in all a GREAT idea had it been toned down to the masses but a superb book for literary snobs and the French aficionado. My favorite conversation in the book is between Oscar Wilde and Alice B. Tolkas (as cats), "Never disparage a surface. Nothing recommends beauty more than superficiality. Real beauty walks through the world uncluttered and unmasked. It dosen't hide in the earth like a truffle, attendant on the tender mercies of a passing pig." Bravo, Bill Richardson for awakening the dead!!

This book is a must read for anyone contemplating the reading of Salman Rushdie's, "The Satanic Verses." It places into perspective an insight into all of the hoopla.Salman Rushdie wrote a little book back in 1988 that literally placed his head on a platter. Was it literature or blasphemy against the Islamic religion? The debate continues to this day. In this book Daniel Pipes (author of several books on the Middle East), attempts to explain the controversy that exists around Rushdie's words. The satanic verses are basically a few words referring to the existence of Meccan goddesses and whether or not they were acknowledged by the Prophet Muhammad. Apparently historical beliefs exist that suggest the possibility of Muhammad being coerced by nobles to recognize their idols/goddesses in exchange for a chance to continue preaching within their vicinity without restrictions. The problem with this theory is that it then makes the religion of Islam non-existent as a faith because it goes against the monotheistic belief that Islam is based upon and also suggests that Muhammad wrote the Holy Qur'an as a human being and not as an inspired prophet of God. Rushdie ran into trouble when he wrote an extremely blasphemous novel based on these controversial verses and basically laughed into the face of the Islamic faith ruffling some very fundamentalist feathers along the way.Daniel Pipe brings a relatable book to the table which explains how Rushdie, the Ayatollah and the West started and resolved the controversy surrounding, "The Satanic Verses." What was once a complicated issue now seems entirely explainable from all fronts due to this book by Pipes. Rushdie is explained as a highly educated man who spends his life basically making a mockery of many things with an intellectual snobbery and seemingly massive ego. However Rushdie has a right to freedom of speech that is without question, but was that right taken to extremes in order to create a platform for infamy? In my opinion Rushdie knew exactly what he was creating and in fact weathered the storm quite well while receiving a mountain of publicity and notoriety that quite possibly the novel on its own doesn't stand up to. I believe the average reader would not be able to relate to Rushdie's weighty style and cultural references and that had the uproar been non-existent the novel would be relegated to the discount book pile and soon forgotten. Rushdie has great marketing skills but at what price?So why such a violent response? Pipes writes a thorough explanation as to why the Ayatollah decreed a fatwa against Rushdie and his publishers. In the western world this action appears rather harsh but in the Islamic tradition of punishment towards individuals who blaspheme God it was merely an action supported by a law most westerners do not understand. Call it cultural divide if you will with a huge exclamation point! And so it goes. This book provides additional insight into the ever present differences between the Middle East and the Western world and continues to pertain to modern issues as well. From a tolerant God stems the intolerance of man and his religions. After reading this book you might begin to understand the serious faith of the Islamic world and the laws they live by. Although we live in a complicated world taking a step towards understanding one another can begin with well-rounded explanations such as those found within this book by Daniel Pipe. The ideas are multifaceted but very necessary to contemplate in order to be a citizen of the world today.

Is it real or make-believe? Regardless this independent film offers a stunning, tension filled ride through the streets of war torn Afghanistan. Filmed in a documentary filmstyle with hints of bravado it will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end.The film begins with a reporter Don Larson (George Calil) aboard a plane destined for Kabul. His goal is to capture video coverage of the Al-Qaeda operatives and to possibly get in on the bounty for Bin Laden. He is young, exuberant and bold in his pursuit of the men he believes to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks and he does not back down from questioning by Afghani supporters of the attacks. Larson places himself and his crew into all sorts of hairy predicaments fully aware that his life is at stake such as an arms deal gone wrong, an ambush by Afghani police and a shoot out with unknown assailants in the complex mountain areas bordering Pakistan. Acting as Larson's interpreter is Wali Razaqi, an American of Afghani descent and the often unseen camera man follows their every move. The footage is both chilling and authentic and the actors bravely insane.Although the filming style of this movie is its draw I found the writing to be absolutely effective. The characters are allowed to be more than war mongers in pursuit of blood. The script allows for Calil to be the action hero as well as a very vulnerable and afraid man. Calil is excellent in this role and stepped out on a limb in order to play it. But it is the ending of this film that really hits home and ties the tangled web together with more than just tape.

This is a visually beautiful book with tests and profiles that are supposed to guide you towards seeing yourself better.There are four sections in this book: Body Types, Feeling Types, Thinking Types and Spiritual Types. Each section contains several ways of pinpointing your unique structure. Unfortunately some of the profiles offset one another, such as having a thin body full of energy and being told later that you were born under a sign that encourages laziness....but then I don't think it is meant to be entirely accurate just entertaining. Regardless the tests and profiles are interesting and fun to do. The best part of this book is the way it makes you step out of the norm and see yourself under a new age light.I recommend this book purely for the entertainment value and something interesting to do on a lazy afternoon or with friends. But to really see yourself just take a long look in a mirror and be honest!

This remake of a 1975 horror film is actually much more of a comedy but it carries tremendous punch directed at the heart of all the so called "moral values" of wealthy American families.Joanna (Nicole Kidman) begins this film as a real power hungry modern woman who runs her own network. Her husband (Matthew Broderick) seems happy to just surf behind her enormous wake while their children have everything but a real family to relate to. Upon losing her career, Joanna hits rock bottom and her husband sees a way to move the whole family to Connecticut in order to re-group and get happy. Meet Stepford, a charming and affluent town of plastic wealth where everything is just as perfect as can be and oh so morally correct......American suburbia explained. The town is filled with fixed smiles, happy but nerdy husbands, lots of lace and pastels and not a hair out of place, except for the husbands with comb-overs that is. From the outside such perfection is enticing but finally a film dares to show the reality of being a modern woman at the mercy of the American dream.....the idea fails but this movie soars!This film is directed by Frank Oz and he has done a really beautiful job with the scenes and coloring of this project. The funniest scenes are also the most heartbreaking exposing the realities of life behind all those perfect houses in the suburbs. Nicole Kidman is really good as the strong willed yet vulnerable Joanna. Broderick is the perfect nerdy but loyal husband with a desire for more control. Glenn Close is excellent as the main Stepford wife and her husband is played eerily by Christopher Walken. But by far the best couple in this film is Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz as the town's Jewish couple so far from perfect that they become infectiously endearing to anyone who can relate to reality.This movie leaves many socio-political stones upturned and vulnerable, mainly the idea that women must be extraordinarily beautiful, concentration camp thin yet extremely well-endowed, proficient at baking a perfect cake, a fiend for boring sex and capable of being placed on mute by a remote or through a controlling man. Sadly I see these women everyday in the nearest grocery store with plastic smiles and botoked cheeks. Unlike the original, this film suggests that the blame lies in a nerdy husband's fear of being overshadowed by a powerful wife with her own opinions. If they can have remotes why can't we? Beware of the mask that society has placed on women and always be willing to control the remote yourself or you might end up in Stepford!

This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. The storyline has no explanation, the characters no soul and the cinematography absolutely no color.Meg Ryan has stepped to an all time low by starring in this movie based on nothing. Her character teaches literature but only shows her teaching in one scene for a brief moment. Other than poetry the only other thing on Ryan's mind is sex. Sadly cute little Meg Ryan just doesn't cut it as a sexual predator who falls in bed at the drop of a hat with homicide detective Mark Ruffalo. Her character is just not fathomable or believable and what did she do to her pretty little face? Ruffalo comes across as just a perverted pig cop looking for a thrill and not smart enough to figure out a crime that exists right under his nose. Maybe it's more than alcohol that rots ones brain! Appearances by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kevin Bacon don't add any depth or understanding to this picture either. As for the sex scenes.....so what! I guess if you like mousy brown colored women who sneer a lot you might get a thrill but Meg Ryan just did herself a complete injustice in my opinion.Director Jane Campion filmed this movie without a drop of any color; every scene is filled with a smog colored hue that almost makes you sick after a few hours. I am not sure what Campion was trying to accomplish with this project, her characters were horribly mis-cast, her script haphazard and lacking in substance and her camera angles only emphasized the worst in her actors. Someone should have been shot for making this movie but I am not sure who to blame more the actors, the director or the scriptwriter. Even the title references something disgusting, as explained by Ruffalo in one over acted sex scene. In my opinion it just doesn't cut it....period!

WATCH THIS MOVIE because of its message and its importance in the death penalty debate within this country.Stanley "Tookie" Williams (Jamie Foxx) founded the LA gang "The Crips" as an outlet towards a violent and often un-regulated community. His intention was not to form a world of calculated killing but rather to protect his small part of the world. But unfortunately with power comes arrogance and violence begets additional violence. Williams lived a superficial life within this turmoil so the so-called monster that emerged should be no surprise. However Williams discovered his purpose and spirituality while confined within the walls of San Quentin Prison and I believe his life was redeemed. Through his writing with the help of journalist Barbara Becnel (Lynn Whitfield) he managed to bring moments of peace and brotherhood to many notorious gangs as his apology to society.Jamie Foxx is brilliant in his portrayal as `Tookie," capturing the essence of the man and providing a glimpse of what it must have been like to be Williams. Lynn Whitfield is as always wonderful in her role as the steadfast reporter who begins to see the human side of a world she once looked down upon. Brendan Jefferson emerges as the young "Tookie" and matches Foxx with his intensity. But it is the director Vondie Curtis-Hall who deserves a round of applause for bringing forth such a tragic and encouraging story about Williams who is now only a part of history. My only criticism on the film would be the fact that the evidence and crime that convicted "Tookie" were not really dealt with...for that we have court documents which are questionable at best.The death penalty debate will rein supreme after watching this important film especially now that "Tookie" has been executed. Is a life in prison for 25 years really the point at which a criminal should be put to death? While the victims that "Tookie" was convicted of killing can never speak is his death their only redemption? It seems that "Tookie" became a real man in the process of his life by overcoming a life of violence and external living and emerging a deeply reflective human being. It seems then that hard and fast rules about the death penalty cannot be cast in stone because some of our country's men are indeed redeemable after all. R.I.P. "Tookie" your last judge is before you! May the works of Williams inspire a life less violent despite his questionable death.

In this film the chaos theory is visited and an interesting dilemma is presented, if you could change the past would it be worth changing?Ashton Kutcher and his childhood portrayers, John Patrick Amedori and Logan Lerman (excellent representations by the way!), go back and forth through time in an attempt to alter the past so that the present circumstances might be better. Kutcher as an adult is a psychology student who can access the past through his childhood journal entries. After several violent incidents that occur during his childhood along with his friends, specifically child abuse, animal torture and a bombing dare gone wrong, Kutcher believes he can change the outcome and save the lives of his cherished friends. In a film that twists and turns and keeps your mind wondering the characters walk back and forth over time making changes and living the outcomes only to continuously be disappointed, life is never perfect no matter how hard they try.Kutcher and his gang do excellent work in this thriller with a message. This movie is suspenseful, gut wrenching and something that will cause one to ponder the source of our own childhood guilt. It will leave you questioning how much you would sacrifice to save the life of your friends. With so much psychological interest on the past affecting ones future it is an interesting concept to theorize upon. By altering the past would it really make life any better or would we just flutter about looking for new butterfly wings to carry us forward into yet another unknown?

George Romero has outdone himself in this third part of his zombie trilogy. This film is his most gruesome and all of the most horrible scenes are described in detail on the added DVD in this version.The zombies have taken over the world and after a "night" of coming to life and a "dawn" of new direction they now outnumber the humans by 40,000 to one. A handful of scientists and military personnel have taken over an underground bunker and slowly drive themselves and the brain-dead zombies more insane. Romero adds the political battle between thinkers and fighters leaving the brink of society to battle out who will win. This time zombies are being studied like lab animals with just about as much disregard. Viewers will ponder if the torture and dissection are really worth the effort until "Bub" begins to show some of his previous human tendencies. Sadly force outweighs will and the humans turn into monsters themselves leaving the last traces of civilization with a slim chance to survive. Be prepared for some very graphically violent scenes and lots of gore!George Romero is a master horror filmmaker and although this part of his zombie films didn't receive as much attention as the first two it is the one with the best storyline and most sophisticated zombie makeup. As always Romero threw in a few questions about society to think over between all the horrors. The "extra" DVD included in this set has another hour of special effects and explanation of how Romero was able to make the zombie bites so terrifying in this film. Also included are cast members who flash back to the original filming and the ordeal they had to endure in order to bring this gruesome film to life. While I still feel the original "Night of the Living Dead" is the all time scariest horror film I also feel that "Day" will still sends shivers up and down your spine in an even eerier way.

This book is based on the Myers-Briggs tests taken by many people in all walks of life, recently very big in business circles and universities. Carl Jung was influential in the development of the original idea for personality tests.As far as accuracy goes I would dare to say this book gets pretty darn close to what our core personality really is. If you answer the questions as honestly as possible the book will describe you almost in a nutshell by the time you finish. Very interesting! Once you figure out what anagram you fall under this book will also offer advice for successful solutions to work, relationship and leisure problems based on personality type.I highly reccommend trying this test at least once, it's fun, revealing and informative. The suggestions may also provide a bit of insight into a better fitting career and/or relationship as well....although nothing is set in stone. Just bring a pencil, an open mind and a honest heart and who knows what you will discover.

For Irving fans only.... because as a work on its own this novel is missing more than the main character's hand.Main character, Patrick Wallingford, is the pretty boy newscaster everyone wants until he suffers an accident while reporting a story in India. Through his search for a missing hand Wallingford finds other parts in his life lacking as well. But his ability to piece his body and his life together is flawed at best.John Irving offers only a fragment of his capabilities in this novel leaving true fans to wonder if it was written by the phantom hand he writes about. Instead of providing us with complex and comically interesting characters, Irving only touches upon his true abilities here. His characters are rather shallow and the plot not very well thought out. If this is your first Irving read....try something else before stopping here. While this novel is readable it sort of leaves you wanting something else to applaud in other words it leaves the reader feeling like clapping with one hand instead of two. I'm glad Irving has better works to pick from!

I admire Maria Shriver for what she has accomplished in life without the constant help of the silver spoon she was born with. She is an amazing woman in her own right and has worked hard to become a person of great integrity and wisdom. So who better to write a book on life lessons than someone who has learned a few along the way.Ms. Shriver wrote this book after she received so much positive response from a little commencement address she had given. I only wish I had heard such a profound speech before I had set off into the world. After reading this book I realize I only do part of the necessary steps for life success and I am now inspired to work my way into all 10. She recommends: Finding your passion, take any job as a stepping stone, respect your coworkers, be responsible for your behaviors, fail without fear, discard the myth of Superwoman, pay attention to your family life, work on your marriage, make your own money and LAUGH!! It takes alot of energy to live life correctly so be prepared and reach for this little book of wisdom for inspiration.

I ran to buy this CD after seeing &quot;The Passion&quot; and I have nothing but an excellent rating for this soundtrack.The music is haunting and wraps you in a cloak of inspiration. Perfect of meditating, praying, pondering life as well as relaxing after a long day. I personally find arabic type music breathtaking and many songs on this CD carry whispers of instruments that are not often heard on American CD's. You are able to envision biblical times, with harems and tribes and all that life offered even the tragedy and triumph of Christ. John Debney has orchestrated a masterful soundtrack that I highly recommend for those of you spiritually inclined.

This movie brings to life the horror of what war is really about. Civilization becomming zombies to ethnic cleansing...it continues to happen right before our eyes.Dennis Quaid does an EXCELLENT job as an American soldier who witnesses the murder of his wife and son, while in Paris, by terrorists. He reacts the way most people react, with anger and revenge on his mind. This lands him in the Foreign Legion where he continues to kill in anger as a mercenary for the Serbs. He plays the part of a heartless killer, backed by an army, with great conviction.Natasa Ninkovic plays a Serbian woman who is pregnant by a Muslim rapist. She suffers the fate of many women during war, persecution for something that is not her fault. She is beaten because she carries a Muslim child, disowned and stalked by her family for dishonor and walking through life unsure if she even wants to live. Who would? After giving birth because of the beating she becomes distant and withdrawn only surviving by the protection of Dennis Quaid who comes to her aid and wakes up from his own death trance. The scenes with the baby will rip your heart to pieces, especially when you imagine the reality behind it all. Children are born into this hateful nonsense everyday.This movie is an excellent saga that brings the truth behind hatred to a head. War kills and creates killers out of people who once were only men. It changes societies into cleansing grounds and forgets the individual heart. This war of the Muslims against the Serbs was mostly ignored in America but it was yet another genocide that needs to be remembered and addressed. The director Peter Antonijevic pulls no punches in dealing with the atrocity head on. Bravo to this film....but shame on acts of war!

Oprah's talent contest did not dissapoint. This CD is well put together with the best songs performed by the most talented singers of the group. Lashell Griffin has a beautiful voice with great vocal range and she can give Whitney a run for her money I believe. But my favorite is Lorenzo Owens...the boy can SING!! I see a bright future ahead for Owens and his lead Temptation soulful voice. The other competitors do well especially Lanesha Baca who is well worth mentioning by name. My only complaint is the song by Joe Herzog.....somehow it just sounds like a bad rendition of a Vince Gill song, not my cup of tea and the only song I skip when given a chance.

This is an amazing adult fairy tale filmed by the ever impressive imagination of Tim Burton with several great messages contained within the disguise of an old man's dreams.Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying but he refuses to leave behind his tall tales about all of the situations he has encountered in his life. His wife (Jessica Lange) remains humored by her husband's fantasy life but is troubled that her son cannot seem to warm up to this extraordinary man. Edward's son Will Bloom (Billy Cudrup) has grown weary of his father's inability to deal with reality and is sick of hearing about oversized fish, perfect Southern towns, spectacular circuses, Siamese twins, glass eyes that see the future, haunted forests and gentle giants who don't exist. But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it. With flash backs to Edward's youth (played by Ewan McGregor) all the tales seem come to new life.This is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication. It shows the despair a child experiences when shadowed from the truth and the distance a father creates by telling tall tales hoping to make himself appear more than he seems. But it also shows the ties of a family never quite severed and so close to the core. With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well. This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability. At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace. Only Tim Burton could have managed to bring this book to life. For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments this movie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping. But in the end what is a tall tale? In a world of differences trying to understand another's reality may seem blurry at times but imagine the possibilities if we allow others to envision our most precious dreams.....Tim Burton opens up that other world so grab your pole and go fishing!

I am always intrigued when actors like Daniel Craig can go from playing blockbuster roles (James Bond) back to portraying the vulnerable man. In this film Craig manages to span a range of emotion within the has-been actor he portrays and it certainly makes for an interesting film.This movie is darkly captivating in ways that are often missed in the more popular films with mega-stars. It begins with the superficial surface living of an aging Hollywood star who is obviously succumbing to the excesses of his fame. Craig appears far from his Bond role here. Pop-star Eve makes an appearance as the woman who puts together the pieces of Craig's life and allows him to maintain some semblance of respect. But it isn't until Craig's character hits bottom that we get to the true meat of this picture. In flashbacks we discover how this creature of Hollywood fame was created and suddenly the excesses and egocentricities are allowed. Tragedy and lost love surround our character's younger years (played brilliantly by Harry Eden). It's a coming of age story that ends with surprising results despite having met the outcome of a youth spent so self-absorbed.I have to say that the first part of this film all but bored me, mostly because I abhorred the overly narcissistic character that we are first greeted by. I didn't really care how the man was created and I almost didn't stick around to find out. But to the writer's credit I am glad I did. The early story is beautiful although horribly sad. Craig does an excellent job in his role being both vulnerable and subdued. I was not expecting the raw sentiment so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film after such a shaky start. I confess it isn't my favorite but it is well worth seeing for the consciousness it provokes.

This DVD is described as a &quot;heart-pounding thriller&quot; with &quot;tension filled suspense&quot;......it fails.Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone buy an old home in the boonies (120 acres and a manor for $210K...yeah right!) and never question any of the strange events that occur. Like a weirdo who shows up in your house looking through your things. Instead this guy, played by Stephen Dorff, gets a good meal and a job.As for suspense, it only happens during the snake scene and when the two city ding-dongs are standing over a pit....you just know one of them will be pushed in! All in all this movie could have been interesting if only the characters would not have been so incredibly weak and stupid. Worth watching but not buying unless you adore mindless scare tactics.

For anyone concerned about war and the repercussions of a single mis-guided bomb this documentary will shed some light on often ignored ideas about the subject of war.This film contains mostly historical images and memories of the Cold War Era, World War II and Vietnam as seen through the perspective of Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Despite looking at war through hindsight the results remain the same, civilians die in despair, soldiers are placed in harms way and educated desk jockeys with a famous name direct it all behind the cover of powerful governments. I found McNamara to be both humble and amazingly sensitive to the catastrophe of what he subjected our American soldiers to during the Vietnam War. Even though McNamara was notorious for being arrogant, uncommunicative and boldly defiant when faced with protecting his presidents (Kennedy & Johnson), with age I think you will find he has mellowed and looked at his wake honestly and with some regrets. I found him to be similar to our current Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who has apparently not learned any of the lessons McNamara is teaching these days. I wonder if Rumsfeld will be so forthcoming in another 30 years to admit his weaknesses and errors along with his administrations.McNamara claims that war cannot end without ruining communities and propagating death and destruction in its wake. He is honest in his description of the loss that other countries have suffered at our often expedient retaliations, for instant 100,000 people were incinerated in Tokyo alone PRIOR to dropping nuclear weapons during WWII and he feels that this occurred partly because of his analysis of what the weapons our government was developing could do. McNamara clearly states he felt he acted as a war criminal but was never tried. He also fully admits responsibility for the deaths of thousands of civilians. He questions the survivability of the human race when over 2500 nuclear weapons exist within reach of a single world leader who chooses to make a very bad decision on any given day. He feels that war morality is purely based upon winning and that leaders choose war because they believe what the see and not what is truth. Funny how that statement applies today! Interestingly enough even in Vietnam our generals were asking for more troops while the Washington desk jockeys reduced the call-up by half and this fact continues to occur today. Many aspects of this film will clearly resonate within the Iraq war. So how much evil will eventually equal good?Robert McNamara provides 10 lessons about war that need to be heeded by all future generations and leaders:1. The human race will not eliminate war but can reduce brutality by seeking "just" wars.2. Human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to destruction.3. America is not omniscient and should not proceed unilaterally except in our own defense.4. Moral principles are ambiguous but US Foreign policy should seek to avoid the carnage of 160 million dead in the 20th century alone.5. We have failed as a nation to advance fundamental necessities of nutrition, literacy, health and employment both at home and abroad.6. Corporate executives have a responsibility to their employees, their customers and to society as a whole.7. Kennedy states: "The primary responsibility of a president is to keep the nation out of war if at all possible."8. Individuals should be held responsible for crimes against humanity and a system of jurisprudence based on the International Court should be supported.9. Terrorism will not be dealt with effectively without empathy.10. The U.S. is contributing to the breakdown of the Non-Proliferation Regime and placing society at risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction.It seems the fog has indeed been lifted but now it takes listening to. Afterall "out of the mouth of babes" may come something interesting but true wisdom always comes from the elders, those folks that have lived through exactly what we never want to live through again but are on the verge of doing. The most profound revelation I learned from this film was a fact that McNamara struggled over, he stated that the mere mention of withdrawing troops from Vietnam by Kennedy resulted in the military coup that killed Diem of South Vietnam and began the war in Vietnam. Aren't we currently doing the same in South Korea and will America only be left to blame once again? McNamara's learned wisdom is important to contemplate but more significant is caring how we are represented by our government to the rest of the world and realizing that all of the blood shed in our name can never be washed clean. It will always leave the threat of fog if we place our future in the wrong hands.

A cutsey journal geared towards young girls but fun for anyone. It even contains a test to tell just how dysfunctional you really are.This journal has pages of crazy graphics and fonts, places for pictures of people who make you gag, lines to record your lies and mischievousness and many quotes from famously naughty people. A great gift for teenage girls as most of the questions are geared toward their mentality. Adults might find it fun to remember the old glory days as well. Silly and playful and fun for the young at heart.

Tim Burton is pure genius. In this little book of melancholy poetry he combines humor, darkness and independent thought into indescribable delight.This petite book of 23 short poems is the definition of creativity and artistic expression. Burton's poetry is simple, rhythmical and completely unique. His characters are as varied as "James" to "The Boy With Nails in His Eyes," each offering a touch of whimsy beside an outsider existence. Anyone who has ever felt different will somehow relate! Complete with Burton's own drawings of each distinctive character it is a very entertaining experience.If you enjoy Tim Burton's films and relate to his ability to tell the tale of misshapen outcasts you will enjoy this chance to savor Burton in print. Adults and children alike can chuckle and moan at the inventiveness of a true original.

Quentin Tarantino has managed to create something unexplainably brilliant with his duo of films, "Kill Bill." Only Tarantino could have pulled these films off. Part one is the Eastern version with a huge emphasis placed on the physical aspect of the characters.In KB Pt. 1 we meet "The Bride" played fantastically by Uma Thurman. The opening scene is gruesome and starts this film off on a path that others would have totally butchered. Part one is graphic and brutal in some scenes so be prepared, blood flows in buckets here! Thurman is a trained assassin who discovers that she is pregnant and decides to retire, an easy decision but it makes a mountain from a mole hill. Thurman spends the rest of the film seeking revenge for the wrongs she suffers and she does it brilliantly. "The Bride" aka "Black Mamba" aka Thurman uses the finesse and artistic beauty of Kung Fu and other martial arts to reek havoc on her prey. The fight scenes with Lucy Liu are cinematically beautiful and the group fight is perfectly choreographed. Thurman outdoes herself!Starring with Uma Thurman is a cast of characters played by, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Julie Dreyfus, and many stars from the real Kung Fu genre. Tarantino managed to cast his characters perfectly and has created some very interesting foes for Thurman to avenge herself against. The film is told in chapters with each arch enemy dealt with in a great short story. Tarantino shoots with fantastic colors and unique lighting so that each frame is something stunning to behold. He takes a fun stab at Kung Fu films from China, the old spaghetti Westerns from Italy and even a few horror scenes straight out of De Palma's generation. Tarantino winds his way through this film making many little pictures that mesh into one, he has become a master at directing this type of picture and manages to hold the interest of his audiences the entire way."Kill Bill" Pt. 1 may not appeal to all people although it is a journey highly recommended for its utter uniqueness, beautiful scenes and great music matched perfectly to the background stories. It is bloody and brutal but in some strange way entirely necessary and not out of context. Between all of the sword fights, Kung Fu kicks and fatal injuries the story is really good. "The Bride" is relatable and you will root for Thurman and her stoic vulnerability until the very end. All I can say is Wow!

This grand monster hunt comes to life as Van Helsing and pays tribute to all the truly great classic monsters while remaining visually interesting enough for all of today's special effects enthusiasts.The movie begins in a creepy castle, filmed in black and white, and we meet Dr. Frankenstein, his Monster, Dracula and Igor as all the fun begins. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is busy in Paris battling a nasty but large Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame Cathedral. Meanwhile across Europe, and in a little country called Transylvania, a brave and daring heroine (Kate Beckinsale) has hopes of saving her brother from life as a Wolfman. All of the greats are represented here (minus the Mummy) and the story is both interesting and classically told.Stephen Sommers has made a visually beautiful and classic monster film paying fantastic tribute to all those who came before him. The special effects are quite good and you will find yourself transported into a really good video game that allows one to discover something different every time this film is seen. Jackman is the perfect hero as the title character being handsome, strong and silly all at the same time. Kate Beckinsale brings the typical frail heroine into a new light as the strong and feisty Princess Anna. The main nemesis is Dracula, played humorously by Richard Roxburgh. Dracula's brides are sexy, evil and quite vicious. Will Kemp plays the Wolfman and looks great out of costume! Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to life with the perfect blend of humor and snide remarks but sadly no flies and finally the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) finally has a voice and uses it well. Altogether the cast in this film is highly entertaining and the storyline quite interesting. Of course the special effects in this film often override true human talent but they are well worth your time.This film is fun, entirely entertaining and beautiful to watch unfold while at the same time being a wonderful tribute to all of the classic monsters. A great film for the family that doesn't take monsters (and fighting them) too literally. Sommers has mastered the ability to take traditional monster movies and spin them into a new form while paying proper tribute to the original. I suspect Van Helsing will emerge as the new hero of modern monster films and foresee a sequel ready to be bolted into life.

This interesting foreign film is a character study involving three young girls growing up feeling a need to rebel against authority.Another Audrey Tautou hit...In this film she is still the camera's best friend as a 20ish woman breaking away from her mother and trying to reach her older lover. She encounters a few setbacks and meets two sisters along the way who give her life new thrill. The sisters are played by Olivia Bonamy and Axelle Ade-Pasdeloup who both do fantastic jobs portraying a pair of bored and lonely kids looking for a better way in life. Unfortunately the sisters coerce Tautou into joining their amateur game of stealing wallets from men they entice with the possibility of sexual favors. It seems to be a good game with a lot of vulnerably stupid men falling for promise rather than brains but the game is illegal and only serves to cause the young women more problems.This French film is not high powered and action packed but it is enticing in its subtle way. Each of the three young women arrives at the little game they develop with a different goal in mind. The youngest (Ade-Pasdeloup) is a straight "A" student and enamored with biology, her older sister (Bonamy) it a bitter calculator who shrewdly distances herself from others and lastly Tautou is the fragile woman on the edge feeling a need for a heart stopping thrill. As the film moves along the driving forces are slowly revealed finally satisfying viewers. It is not Tautou's best but it is pretty good despite the devilish activities.

This film should have received much more recognition; it is a beautiful true story about a mentally challenged person who strives to fit in with society as a functioning human being. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. deserved Oscar nominations!If you love sports and "old-school" memories this film is a perfect picture to watch. The movie begins in South Carolina during the 70's it is based on the true story of a boy named "Radio" and a football coach who takes him under his wing, Coach Jones. It is a story of triumph mixed with racism, prejudice and great spirit. Coach Jones suffered persecution from town folks for his loyalty to Radio and Radio suffered taunting and old southern racism at times. The friendship is heroic and uplifting you will not be disappointed by the film or the storyline because it will appeal to almost anyone.Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as "Radio"; he takes on the intricate behavior of a man afflicted with a mental challenge. His smile will pull at your heart strings and his spirit will inspire a better life for those of us without handicaps. Gooding conveys the innocence of a man-child who wants to belong as an active part of his hometown. In my opinion he deserved to win an Oscar for this performance, especially the scenes involving his feelings towards his loyal Mother.Along with Gooding I felt Ed Harris (as always) did an excellent job as Coach Jones. Despite the hardships remaining loyal to Radio presented, this man endured it all and assisted in helping Radio become a contributing member of his town. Harris is stoic and tender able to show great emotion and endure the backlash. Together Radio and Coach Jones manage to create a useful life where one could easily have been overlooked, especially in the South during the 70's.I recommend this film highly for an evening of true inspiration. Not to be overlooked is the fantastic music playing in the background filled with "old-school" memories and all those great AM radio moments.

Believe all the hype that you have heard on this film it is absolutely wonderful in so many ways.Meet Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his engaged friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) as they embark upon a last effort at freedom before Jack heads down the aisle. Miles is a hapless writer struggling to overcome a breakup with an old flame and Jack is every woman's worst nightmare...that really stupid, overly sexy man who lies like a fiend! The friends end up going for a tour of wineries, Miles is obsessed with Pinot Grigio and Jack with sex. As they spend a week together things start to unravel because of lost dreams, new lives and selfish indulgences that lead to broken hearts along the way. The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco. A waitress (Virginia Madsen) coming to terms with a divorce and a new way of life describes wine as only a true poet can. While a wild and exuberant wine pourer (Sandra Oh) indulges herself in more than one area. So it is a week of laughter, disappointment, rage and discovery for all the parties involved. But the wine is the true star!This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub-textural subject. It deals with the complexities of relationships the same way that wineries deal with their crops, some are quick and tart while others have to sit before they build their full bouquets. The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters. Madsen is luminous and has the best lines; her character probably the best soul. Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold. Church makes women swoon and then cringe but he also makes viewers laugh out loud. And Sandra Oh has the best revenge scene ever filmed....you go girl! Together the blend has an essence of vanilla, a touch of oak and absolutely no horrible aftertaste because it is aged and cared for just like a fine body of wine shelved sideways.

And suddenly the silly boy grows up.....George Michael has scored a fantastic adult contemporary CD. He brings together his upbeat club world with that of a 40's jazz singer and merges the two worlds in a classic setting with beautiful music attached.&quot;Jesus To A Child&quot; is musically brilliant. &quot;Fast Love&quot; is upbeat without being obnoxious. &quot;Older&quot; is pure sentimental jazz. &quot;Spinning The Wheel&quot; merges two worlds without colliding. &quot;It Dosen't Really Matter&quot; soft and quiet. &quot;The Strangest Thing&quot; another musical gem. &quot;To Be Forgiven&quot; traces of a romantic movie seduction. &quot;Move On&quot; back to the jazz club. &quot;Star People&quot; classic George club beat. &quot;You Have Been Loved&quot; great slow cut both musically and vocally. &quot;Free&quot; a final trace of Film Noir, mysterious and calling.Bravo!! George Michael has convinced me he isn't just another pretty boy but a true musician with an inventive mind who is willing to take a risk on something out of the ordinary. I hope we all age so well!

For journal writers who need a push to get going this is a perfect little set of inspiration."Inner Outings" is the perfect tool to have on hand for those days when journaling seems like drudgery. The Book of Exploration contains suggestions for keeping a diary and how to develop the best writing technique for your life. The book explains the cards otherwise you might be lost without it. The cards are pretty and creative but make little sense on their own standing. With titles like "A Gift For Me" and "Doorways" you would have to be very creative to find inspiration from the cards alone, but with help from the book you will discover that "A Gift For Me" could be a prompt to write about a great gift, a person, a talent, who you are a gift to, your ten best gifts and so on, while "Doorways" become real or imagined and open or closed.Once you run through the cards a few times the process gets a little easier and journaling much more interesting and individual. We all wake up in the morning, go about our routines and fall into a deep slumber at night, but with this set next to your journal you might surprise yourself with how interesting you really are.

This book offers sensible advice for practicing writers and other so-called dreamers. It is well written but holds no surprises.Carolyn See has offered her words of wisdom for anyone embarking on a literary life. Her approach is no nonsense and hands on but it seems to lack creativity. For any writer who has approached writing as a business rather than a creative project there is nothing new to be learned here. See suggests writing 1,000 words a day, pretending to be a writer, learning to write "charming notes" to other writer's and editor's, figuring out how to handle criticism and hanging out with others subjecting themselves to the same torture for the sake of their craft. At times See writes with great vision and offers practical support but at other times she drifts towards a personal memoir that is scattered and irrelevant. But for beginning writer's searching for advice on the business and some of the processes involved in paving that golden road towards publication this book is well worth delving into.The process of writing is given great attention in this book by Carolyn See however it is geared towards the beginning writer trying to learn the ABC's of the business. See has been successful as a writer using her exercises and theories but she seems to lack creative vision in this book preferring instead to stay on the practical side. But overall this is a wonderful book to keep on your shelf for reference when all else fails and you are suffering from a bout of writer's block. With methodical precision See will have you back in the game.

I love taking a trip to France with Joanne Harris, but this novel fell short of what Harris is normally capable of.The main character is a much used Harris character, a crotchety old lady who runs a caf&eacute; in a quaint little French town. Her life is a bit of a mystery but explained with flashbacks to her tragic childhood urged on by messages her mother leaves her in an old scrawled cookbook. Eventually the anger of the old woman makes sense but I was left hoping for more. Harris writes with such explanatory sensitivity to the senses that her books are normally explorations into another world. I enjoyed this novel but I didn't find it as appealing as many of her others.Harris makes a mystery out of this novel, leading the readers down paths that would have been more effective had they been written with her more unique and magical hand. Instead we are immersed in the beauty of French cooking, the countryside and in the quaintness of little villages only to be sabotaged by the harshness of corrupt Germans and a touch of the war resistance. I wish the story had been told with less effort and more lyrical meaning, as Harris is quite capable of weaving together great fairy tales of hope. I loved certain aspects of this novel but yawned through other parts. The smell of oranges will pervade your senses as you read, don't forget what Harris brings to the table despite the five quarters of this story.

What an interesting idea....&quot;If&quot; asks all those questions no one ever thinks to ask. Inspiring thoughtful answers and a few moments of contemplation. It starts out as a game and ends as a revealing guide to character. A great way to break the ice at parties and boring business dinners. I love to present this book over a bottle of wine with someone I love, you would be amazed at what you don't know about those closest to you...hours of innocent fun!

This book is a wonderful memoir of a New York family that moves to Paris for a period of 5 years with a young son in tow.Adam Gopnik writes this book in a style of short stories or essays that weave into one great book. He offers a well thought out idea of what must be said from an American in Paris. His comparisons are very real, some light-hearted, some blatantly profound. Gopnik shows his vulnerability many times as a fish out of water, but he tries harder than the average American to blend into his surroundings and take on some of the easier characteristics of becomming French like developing a fondness for a life of profound beauty, a taste for well prepared food, relaxing into the dining experience of the cafes and brasseries, showing his son the art of the carousel rather than the brainlessness of &quot;Barney&quot;, and eventually creating another child born a Parisian.The best chapters in this book are the ones that Gopnik writes about his son discovering himself in Paris. His favorite food becomes croissants rather than ketchup fast food burgers, his puppy love with a young French girl in the Ritz pool, how he would rather play at the Luxembourg Gardens than with a television and most importantly how he adapts to becomming a childish little Frenchman. With this said the one chapter I would skip is &quot;The Rookie&quot; a portion in the book that somehow just dosen't fit. From the elegance of the French life back to the world of baseball? Personally I would have just left the entire chapter with an editor and walked away.Gopnik shows how well he has adapted to French life in the portions of the book that he dedicates to the cafe Balzar. This cafe becomes the victim of a corporate buyout and is almost lost until a band of dining brothers glue themselves together and form a secure fortress in pure French flair to save the cafe in its original form, garcons and all! It is an interesting look at how easy and yet how complicated life can be in Paris, all that French discussion can lead to something good.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Paris and craves a walk down its Rues. Gopnik makes little things seem absolutely important and accurately describes all of the large and small nuances between the French and Americans. His wife, Martha, says it best, &quot;We have a beautiful existence in Paris, but not a full life, and in New York we have a full life and an unbeautiful existence.&quot; This must be why Paris remains in the minds of most Americans who walk along its streets but slowly find themselves returning home, to the rush and bustle of America with an over-inflated heart.

This film is one of the greatest suspense films of all times and yet has received so little attention. The director combines the suggestion of madness along with the weakness of the wounded human psyche to create a thrilling yet subtle terror movie.Brad Anderson directs this film along the same route as Hitchcock, adding dim lighting, the illusion of fear and suggestions of madness around each and every bend. Filmed at Danvers State Mental Hospital the building itself is as creepy as can be with haunting hallways and torture gadgets, used on the unlucky and insane, lurking in every corner. Anderson allows this story to unfold without being overly graphic or campy. A five man crew is hired by the state to clean up the old hospital and rid it of the asbestos that is contaminating its walls but much to their surprise other contaminations exist. David Caruso is the crew negotiator suffering from anger related issues towards the crew man who stole his wife. His partner, Peter Mullan, is the first to become unknowingly sensitive to the evil that lurks in the walls. Another crew member discovers tapes in the basement that reveal the trauma of a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder and opens up more than he imagines. So in one week the crew is faced with various events that lead to a frightening conclusion.Anderson opens up the definition of madness leading one to believe that we all carry a bit of it inside of us waiting to be ignited. In today's world where medication is the treatment rather than lobotomies it is a scary thought. Anderson manages to trigger our senses with eerie tapes and looming walls, suspending his viewers within the gloom of an empty madhouse. The voice of "Simon" grabs the weak and wounded how will he affect you?

Lionel Richie is/was a great artist and I am a big fan, but sadly this CD dosen't live up to what I expect from such a great singer/songwriter.The Hits: &quot;Just For You&quot; although it almost sounds like a U2 ripoff. &quot;I Still Believe&quot; a standard hopeful easy listening cut. &quot;Just To Be With You Again&quot; a soft almost old Richie jingle. &quot;She's Amazing&quot; upbeat and jazzy. &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; a folky sort of cut. &quot;World Is Our Party&quot; old school dance cut. &quot;Dance For The World&quot; a modern &quot;We Are The World&quot; with a cool Indian chant attached. &quot;In My Dreams&quot; nicely done softly jazzy. &quot;One World&quot; classic Richie, simply done, simply put with a big chorus for inspiration.The Misses: &quot;Time Of Our Life&quot; a really bad duet with Lenny Kravitz that dosen't do either justice. &quot;Outrageous&quot; a teenage garage band could have done better. &quot;Road To Heaven&quot; starts out like an old motown groove but then somehow crosses with bad country. &quot;Do Ya&quot; a bad old guy/young guy mix that stabs at funk.Overall this CD is half worth the purchase. I wish artists like Lionel Richie would wait until they have a complete album before releasing it. In the past Richie's CD's have been of the quality that can be left on the player to replay over and over again...the music blends nicely together. Unfortunately this CD makes me restless and I find myself getting up to fast forward a few too many times.

This is a great gift for for anyone claiming "diva-status." A silly journal filled with places for pictures (of yourself of course), an all about me section (for those of us who find ourselves facinating and worth mentioning), all about clothes, sex, men, shopping, and shallow silly incidents. This journal is a gag gift for adults, a real gift for teens, and a hoot for old farts bent on remembering their fabulous life as a diva.

&quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; is one of those books that got so much hype and presentation that I almost didn't bother to read it....I usually don't find bestsellers very appealing. However I kept running across the book and decided to give it a try.I LOVED this book. Sue Monk Kidd writes beautifully about a young white girl in search of her own mystery. She finds her answers in a unique and forbidden place, the home of Black Madonnas and bees. I imagine Jim Crow is rolling over in his grave about now! A perfect book for our times crossing racial divides and knocking them into dust. Love and respect can conquer all.I was very impressed with the way Kidd involves bees as their own character within the book. I learned something I never knew about honey, not just that it is sweet, but that it can also be considered medicinal. The story is woven together by the bees and their glorious honey in a way that keeps you reading until the very end. You will never look at bees or race in quite the same way.

Bravo to the filmmakers for this international psychological thriller! I found this film to be one of the best suspense pictures I have ever seen.The film takes place in France as a Dutch couple is about to embark on a vacation together. After stopping at a highway rest stop their lives change forever and with an eerie foreboding that lingers throughout the entire film. The couple is played by Gene Bervoets and Johanna ter Steege with convincing roles as innocent lovers who never suspect danger lurking in their paths.Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu is brilliant as the sociopath mathematician who stalks women at rest stops throughout the film. He is the perfect villain, an unsuspecting and happy family man who commutes between his city home and country home all the while plotting with numbers and calculations to capture gullible women and commit some mysterious act on them. Donnadieu is creepy and scary without doing anything obvious to portray himself that way. The uneasiness that surrounds him is comparable to some of the best American suspense films involving psychopaths. He decides from an early age to go against the odds and jump from buildings just because the probability factor is so remote that he would ever do so. This act then extends into adulthood and begins his current quest. The filmmakers never reveal exactly what Donnadieu is attempting but you will be glued to this film so that you can find out.The ending of this film is phenomenal.....one of the best ever! It will send shivers up and down your spine. For suspense lovers this is a must own DVD for the French scenery, the creepy evil that lurks in its corners and the ever present sense of dread.

I began reading this wonderful biography of Marie Antoinette while planning a trip to France and although the book is long, and at times rather tedious, it did not dissapoint my intrigue with this historically tragic figure.Antonia Fraser has written what seems to be about as accurate a biography as possible. Many horrible stories have been told about Marie Antoinette and this book covers those as well as many more that I never knew. Like most people my introduction to Marie Antoinette was with her &quot;Let them eat cake...&quot; speech and her over-extravagant life style. It seemed almost understandable that she was beheaded based on such misrepresentation. In reality the story reads much more tragically once you get to know a bit about her life and how it all ended.Imagine being a precocious but innocent young girl raised up like property to be sold to the highest royal bidder. Then at 14 being sent away from your friends and family to become the wife of another royal child. Marie Antoinette left Austria and had to adapt to becomming a future queen of France within only a few short years. The French, during those times, being notoriously inclined to think of Austrian women as unflattering and unfeminine oafs. But young Marie pulled it all off and successfully became the star of France. Her husband Louis XVI was more interested in hunting and gadgets than creating a future French dynasty with Marie. So it isn't a wonder that she fills up her life with all the riches of royality. Her life is a sad saga from beginning to end despite her royality and wealth. The final chapters of this book are unimaginable to fathom. She is taken from her family once again, thrown in a small cell, stripped of any royal privileges and left to contemplate her own demise.Imagine becomming all you never dreamed of, hearing the crowd cheer the beheading of your husband, listening to the coerced testimony of your only son stating the abuses he suffered by your own hands, seeing the head of your friend paraded on a stake past your cell window, hemorrhaging from stress and exhaustion and then having to walk up a platform towards your death with a roaring crowd surrounding you.....few of us could stand it, but Marie Antoinette did. Her story is a great read but in order to get Marie's true essence one must walk the halls of Versailles and then sit in contemplation near her cell in the La Conciergerie.....this extraordinarily strong woman lives on in infamy and her spirit reigns supreme.

Meet the new generation's vacationing family as they travel from California to Missouri and encounter all sorts of silly experiences along the way.Nate Johnson (played by Cedric the Entertainer) begins his family vacation by picking up his SUV from the dealer and finding out he now has a "hip-hop mobile" complete with hydraulics and rapper wheels. His son, (Lil' Bow Wow), now of course thinks of his dad as cool. Estranged from his wife (Vanessa Williams), Nate has convinced her to take a ride to his family reunion along with his teenage boy-crazy daughter (Solange Knowles) and his youngest child (Gabby Soleil). All kinds of funny things happen along the road and family issues begin to come to a head. The reunion is hilarious with Nate and his brother (Steve Harvey) competing for their mother's attention....let the competitions begin!Cedric the Entertainer is very funny in his role as the nerdy insurance selling dad; he is a gifted performer and has the chance to show off all his stuff in this role. Vanessa Williams is still beautiful and amazingly good as the serious Johnson mom. Lil Bow Wow shows he is not all hip-hop in his role as the Johnson son. Solange Knowles is perfectly cast as the teenage Johnson daughter with an eye for the boys. And how sweet is little Gabby Soleil as the youngest Johnson. Of course Steve Harvey cannot be denied as the competitive Johnson brother. The best part of this movie is the talent contest at the reunion where we get to see Cedric in all his glory and Harvey doing a "Miss Jackson" routine! This movie is light-hearted and entertaining for the whole family with a heartwarming ending of course so sit back and let the Johnson's do the driving.

I recommend all of Segalove &amp; Velick's &quot;list&quot; books for people interested in knowing themselves better. This one focuses upon your creative side and exposes strengths and weaknesses you may have thought you never had.This list book contains 8 chapters all centered around different aspects of a person's creativity: Favorite Things, Says Who, You've Got The Power, Heroes, Those What If's, Pride and Joy, The Lightbulb and Brave New World. Each page lists a prompt like &quot;What Do You Do When You Play?&quot; and then provides spaces for your entries. The prompts are interesting and will start the thinking process going and you might even be surprised when you read back your lists....I was.For those of you who are writers or artists this book will help to un-stick you on those foggy days and may even point you in a totally different direction in your thought process so list away!

This little book is perfect for anyone suffering from a bout of fortunate coincidences or a spell of those eerie occurrences that send shivers up and down your spine.Synchronicity is defined as meaningful coincidences and the idea was brought to the forefront by famed psychologist Carl Jung. In this book Deike Begg discusses further meaning to the word and the actions which commonly occur. Begg discovered her own series of coincidences during her research on the Holy Grail; she often ended up right where she needed to be despite the remoteness of her searching. This led her to believe she was being shown the way toward answers she was seeking and she found that if she kept her logic out of the picture and followed the lead of this phenomenon she was always placed in a position of learning. She found that human beings experience this concept at a higher rate when taken out of their normal settings and behaviors. Begg suggests that loved ones we are connected to often find connection through synchronistic events. This fact can be traced to a series of connected events that often occurs after a loved one is lost for example through death. Many times nature comes into play with birds or some other natural being hovering around as if to say goodbye. Cases of such events have been described throughout history from various sources and despite being disregarded by logic and science the events continue to crop up yet remain unexplained.I read this book in one afternoon after receiving a few too many "signs" that something was in the air. While at times Begg may come across as a little new-agy for logical minds you have to allow your mind to expand upon the ideas she presents in order to grasp the concept. Do angels or divine interventions really exist? Begg offers the idea that angels aren't necessarily found in full heavenly gear, in fact at times they may arrive as a passing stranger who happens to offer a few words of advice. It may sound strange but getting lost isn't always a bad event according to Begg who appears to be notoriously taking the "wrong" path only to find another direction that ends up being right. And of course animals offer human beings yet another avenue to explore. How many times do "lost" animals suddenly appear on a doorstep only to deepen life through some unexplained act? If you possess an unalterable scientific or factual mind Begg's book probably won't appeal to you but it may have been synchronicity that brought you to this point, don't pass up the opportunity to learn something new and possibly find an alternative direction.
