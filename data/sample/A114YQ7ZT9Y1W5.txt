A highly interesting and introspective piece into the art of novel writing from one of Europe's finest contemporary authors, Mulan Kundera. His philosophical background is particularly impressive has he attempts to relate back the meaning of his work to existential and phenomenological origins in Husserl, Heidegger, and Nietzsche. I also particularly enjoyed Kundera's comparisons of literature to music in which he describes the forms of multiple Beethoven compositions as well as the basic structures of his own novels. This is an enormously stimulating read, though not necessarily helpful for the blossoming writer.

In this powerful work of philosophy, Nietzsche ponders the value of nearly everything. In the first text Twilight of the Idols, he offers a compelling attack on the prevalent beliefs of his time, including such thinkers as Hegel and Kant, as well as Socrates, theology, morality, and all things German. In the second text, the Anti-Christ, Nietzsche brilliantly and energetically provides his counter-arguement to Christianity and the ways the institution has distorted and murdered the teachings of Christ. His writing is breathtaking and his arguments are made in brief, explosive flashes of immense genius. However, his work can be exhausting as he continues to negate all thought besides his own, and his ability to draw references can be formidable. I'm sure the latter essay will not be palatable to devout Christians but it is necessary that you read it, for it will surely shake the foundations of your belief.

Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict.

How should one read Ulysses at the beginning of the 21st century? The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking `stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: "He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the `meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with.

An epic tome on the art and grandeur of Spanish bullfighting from one of America's greatest aficionados, Ernest Hemingway, who explicates the craft and spiritual intensity of this ancient European ritual through terse, journalistic, prose and rigorous scholarship. Not surprisingly, Hemingway is not terribly perturbed by the grotesque barbarity of the violence of bullfighting; Hemingway was an enthusiast of hunting and had little to no moral qualms about killing animals (and sometimes people). Yet he is not totally insensitive, warning the reader that most spectators of bullfighting are normally disgusted by the killing of the horses more than anything else.For Hemingway, the bullfight is not meant to be understood as an equal battle between man and beast. Rather, it is a tragedy, and the tragedy is for the bull who ought to be killed. He writes, "The best of all fighting bulls have a quality, called nobility by the Spanish, which is the most extraordinary part of the whole business" (113), yet Hemingway does not provide any comment on the utter absurdity of the whole business. Hemingway was a writer obsessed with, and in search of true courage in the face of natural danger and fate, and he found it most explicitly in war and in bullfighting.However, some readers will be surprised to find that `Death in the Afternoon,' is not simply about bullfighting. Hemingway also expounds quite at length about his views on art and the craft of writing. He says: "When writing a novel, a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature" (191). Unfortunately, Hem was never fully successful at creating a living woman, but every writer has a weakness. "A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl" (192).Also included in this altogether excellent volume is a collection of stunning photographs depicting various stages of the bullfight and various matadors of fame; there are also fascinating portraits of the running of the bulls in Pamplona (echoing those fabulous sequences in `The Sun also Rises'). Additionally, Hemingway has provided the reader with a detailed glossary of important bullfighting terms for true aficionados. Originally published through Scribner in 1932.

This little book is indubitable proof of the breadth and depth of Freud's thinking. It is a fascinating and multi-faceted read, containing elements of psychoanalysis, philosophy, poetry, biology, and the literary theory. You will not believe how quickly Freud is able to move from topic to topic and the absurd range within which he is able to speculate. This is also an extraordinarily challenging read, it requires patience and many re-readings. Freud discusses the compulsion to repeat, transference neurosis, life and death drives, and a number of other cognitive and behavioral topics.Here is a curious quote I adore: "In the last resort, what has left its mark on the development of organisms must be the history of the earth we live in and its relation to the sun" (pg. 45).Beyond the Pleasure Principle is a seminal component of his expansive corpus, and should be standard reading for psychologists.

Alexander Dovzhenko's silent war film about the 1918 struggle of Bolshevik workers at a Kiev munitions factory against White Russian troops, which he intermingles with Ukrainian myth. It's an intriguing relic of European filmmaking, clearly influenced by the virtuoso montage editing of Sergei Eisenstein, though it is dated and hampered by the feeling that it was commissioned as propaganda at the time. A multifarious moral examination of war none the less.

This book is not serious scholarship, it is merely an op-ed piece. The author, Michael Parenti does not provide any footnotes to back up his claims; strange coming from a scholar from Yale. No matter how much is said that conforms to my beliefs about politics it simply cannot be relied on as there is almost no evidence within.

A fine work of prose-Duras constructs an impressionistic work about a French girl growing up too fast in Vietnam. Broken and destitute, the narrator grows to fall in love with a Chinese man, as her mother is forced to incessantly handle the problems of her older brother. Duras moves seamlessly moves from first to third person in the web of her prose. This is a book devoted to the act of memory and the emergence of sexuality-it is both autobiographical and yet distant-and it casts a luminous, though faint glow.

Okakura' small distillation of 'Teaism' is really a survey of Eastern philosophy. He points to Zen and Taoism as the foundational ways of thinking that anchor this idea called Teaism. There are brilliant moments of insight in this small and curious book, with many true assessments of the West's shifting perceptions of Eastern civilization. I am reminded of the late Heidegger's philosophy (and indeed Heidegger read 'The Book of Tea), particularly in essays such as 'The Thing' which point out the significance of our everyday objects and their intimate relationship to world and culture. This book is truly a small treasure of Eastern thought.

The classic text of the Frankfurt School remains the most ambitious attempt to synthesize the tools of Marxism and Freudian Psychoanalysis for the project of critical theory. Horkheimer and Adorno have attempted to construct nothing less than a critique of the entire logic of modern domination, immanent within the project of the eighteenth century Enlightenment. Through a highly sophisticated, nuanced analysis of Ancient Greek Myth (with a particularly fascinating exegesis on Homer), Horkheimer and Adorno proceed to interrogate the logics of key Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant and Sade in an effort to further interrogate the "culture industry." Standout analyses of the text include the chapter on anti-semitism and the limits of enlightenment as well as enlightenment as mass deception. While I fundamentally disagree with their argument that the Enlightenment was a project of universalization and technical mastery without self-reflection, I nevertheless see here an intricate, brilliant anatomy of the modern situation.

This book is simply a a joy to read. The language is simple and clear, and yet it evokes extremely powerful images. I think the Old Man in the Sea is not Hemingway's best or most important book, but I do think it contains only what was good about his writing, and nothing that was bad. To me, despite its length, it is biblical in scope and vision, painful, meaningful, and very sad. The old man's return to his home after the sharks have eaten his marlin is one of the greatly tragic moments in all of literature. Be sure to read this beautiful novella over and over.

Lenin's State and Revolution is the most crucial analysis of the Marxian theory of the state and its relation to class struggle. Lenin was a revolutionary determined to reveal the provisional government's capitulation to the forces of imperialism and to revivify the revolutionary edge of Marxism that "socialists" had attempted to obscure. Lenin writes"According to Marx, the state is an organ of class domination, an organ of oppression of one class by another; its aim is the creation of "order" which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression by moderating the collisions between classes."In Lenin's view, the aim of the revolutionary proletariat is to overthrow the state, and in turn, use it to redistribute the wealth and seize control over the means of production. The state will subsequently "wither" in time. State and Revolution is a powerful testament to the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as an excellent critique of the anarchists and social-democrats.

Nietzsche's complex sequel to Beyond Good and Evil is a remarkable achievement of philosophy, philology, and history. It laid the groundwork for such 20th century thinkers as Foucault and Deleuze, though they would never reach Nietzsche's complexity and moral sophistication. In the preface to the book, Nietzsche proposes the project of investigating the origins of morality on the grounds that human beings are unknown to themselves. He is ultimately concerned with the development of moral prejudices, and the value of morality itself. He criticizes mankind in its acceptance of moral principles, and writes: "we need a critique of moral values, the value of these values themselves must first be called in question-and for that there is needed a knowledge of the conditions and circumstances in which they grew, under which they evolved and changed" (456).Nietzsche begins the essay (Good and Evil, Good and Bad), with a philological examination of the words and roots of the words related to good and evil, and a delimitation of their evolution. He makes a connection between the creations of words and places them within the historical context of rulers and nobility. Linguistically, Nietzsche has discovered that the `good' is linked with nobility. He writes: "everywhere `noble,' `aristocratic' in the social sense, is the basic concept from which `good' in the sense of `with aristocratic soul,' `noble,'" (464). Alternatively, words associated with the `bad' invariably were linked with the `plain,' `simple,' and `low.' In this way, morality as a human construction is an extension of power, wealth, and civilization. The origin of evil is intertwined with priestly aristocracies.Nietzsche moves into a discussion of a shift in the history of morality, in which the morality of the priestly aristocracy is superceded by Jewish morality. For Nietzsche, the Jews inverted the morality of nobility and established a system which places value on the lower order of mankind. He indicates that the Jews believed "the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good; the suffering, deprived, sick, ugly alone are pious, alone are blessed by God" (470). Nietzsche describes this turn as `the slave revolt' of morality. He describes the triumph of Judeo-Christian morality over the previous system of values, and indicates that this turn is a triumph for the herd instinct, and for ressentiment. He writes: "The slave revolt in morality begins when ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values: the ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction, that of deeds, and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge" (472). Noble morality develops as an affirmation of itself, while slave morality always says No to what is external to it. For Nietzsche, the need to constantly turn outward to an external `other' and place judgment on it is the essence of ressentiment.In the proceeding section of the treatise, Nietzsche discusses civilization's taming of man the animal. Here he writes: "Supposing that what is at any rate believed to be the `truth' really is true, and the meaning of all culture is the reduction of the beast of prey `man' to a tame and civilized animal, a domestic animal, then one would undoubtedly have to regard all those instincts of reaction and ressentiment through whose aid the noble races and their ideal were finally confounded and overthrown as the actual instruments of culture" (478). Nietzsche insists that Europe's taming of man is a tremendous danger, for we are made to be weary of our own being. For Nietzsche, this weariness and fear of man has compelled us to lose our love for him, to turn our backs on our instincts, to reject affirmation.

This collection of three novellas is indicative of a major turn in avant-garde of American literature. Gertrude Stein's prose here functions through its lacuna's and omissions; it is minimalist in content, but her command of dialect is truly accomplished. Melanctha is the finest work here-the story of a black woman and her relationship in a society that hates her. Of course Stein has been accused of employing stereotypes-but such a critique fails to really live the text in its complexity. I can't say the other two works are as strong, Stein feels almost restrained in her commitment to the vernacular. Nevertheless, this is a seminal work.

Bennington/Derrida's coauthored text is a creative (and often lucid) attempt to demonstrate deconstruction, as well as the life and work of the ever bewitching Derrida. Bennington's contribution is one of the finest attempts at an explanation of Derrida's work yet available. He attempts to systematize deconstruction through a rigorous reading of Derrida's moves and positions from the early work found in 'Writing and Difference,' to the later texts regarding politics and religion. Derrida contributes his 'Circumfession,' a free-wheeling text devoted to the idea of the confession found in St. Augustine (and of course Rousseau), while at the same time providing an opportunity for Derrida to reflect on memories from his life. The circumfession is also a demonstration that deconstruction cannot be systematized, as Bennington's commentary fails to truly 'pin down' the life of Derrida as made evident in this curious little text. Admittedly, I found most of 'Circumfession' hard-going and uninteresting. Perhaps there is simply too much about Derrida's penis. Nevertheless, this book is one of the finest of critical commentaries available.

Louis Malle was perhaps, the quietest, the most meditative, and yet also the most overtly political of the French New Wave filmmakers. Godard eclipsed him in creativity and Truffaut in human empathy, yet there remains a solemn and beautiful unity to Malle's work that often goes unrecognized.This collection includes three films, `Au Revoir Les Enfants', `Murmer of the Heart', and Lacombe Lucien.' `Au Revoir' is about a Catholic seminary that hides some Jewish children during the Nazi occupation. It is apparently autobiographical, but that should not concern the viewer, for it remains a cinematic (and therefore fictitious) meditation on the possibility of a friendship in times of hardship. The film is unfocused, slow, yet very beautiful and affecting. Although there is something peculiar about the way Malle transforms Jean, the Jewish student of genius into an aesthetic object of exoticism. It reflects the nature of anti-semitism in France, which saw Jews as the enlightened `Other,' in contradistinction to the German conceptualization of the Jewish vermin.`Murmer of the Heart,' is the outstanding member of the collection. It is a (I hate to say it) coming-of-age comedy, about a precocious young boy thrown into a wild and raucous wealthy family, where is brothers incessantly create commotion, and his brainless and beautiful mother participates in the chaos to the dismay of her husband, who is a gynecologist. Lea Massari is wonderful as the mother. The film is funny, elegant, and highly sensual and provocative."Lacombe Lucien,' is about why Fascism exists. It is a study of an adolescent who has no moral center, and blankly works for the Vichy regime and informs on members of the resistance. It is about nihilism, though the film's tone is never severe (perhaps regrettably). There are beautiful moments in this film, particularly of the interiors and that marvelous, yawning great dane. But the film simply goes on for too long. The last half hour of the film is simply devoid of any meaningful or stimulating content. It is a handsome failure.A very nice collection of films on the whole, the extra features disc is just a way to raise the excessive price.

Trotsky's analysis of the early stages of the Communist Revolution in China is a remarkable exegesis of Stalin's dictatorial and anti-revolutionary attempts to organize a political leadership for the sake of working against the peasantry. Trotsky is especially meticulous in his documentation of Stalin's internal declarations of aligning the U.S.S.R. with the Chiang Kai-Shek and the Kuo-Min Tang. Trotsky writes: "The Communist Party of China has been a shackled party in the past period. It did not have so much as its own newspaper. Imagine what this means in general and especially in a revolution! [..] Can we tolerate anything like this? This means to disarm the the proletariat politically" (89). Trotsky constantly called for the arming of the proletariat and the forming of independent Soviets in China, while Stalin constantly fought against it. Perhaps if Trotsky had been in the position to implement his politics more directly the history of Communism in China would have been different.

Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains one of the most powerful and cryptic tomes in the history western thought. Is this a work of philosophy or poetry? Due to the immense power of Nietzsche's writing, it remains highly readable, even for those who are not usually comfortable reading philosophy. In the prologue, Nietzsche describes Zarathustra's isolation in the mountains and his intention to descend so that he can teach mankind. Zarathustra proclaims that God is dead and the overman, the sort of man who has overcome his own nature. Zarathustra proclaims: "The time has come for man to set himself a goal. The time has come for man to plant the seed of his highest hope" (17). Nietzsche is passing his philosophical project onto Zarathustra as an author might pass his personal impressions onto a fictional character. Zarathustra is a new symbol of wisdom in the modern era; he teaches that man is now burdened with the task of creating a meaning for himself. In Zarathustra's speeches, he speaks of the "three metamorphoses of the spirit" (25), which include how the spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion a child. For Nietzsche, even the lion of freedom is not sufficient; the child who can create represents the possibility of an overman. Zarathustra says: "The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred `Yes.' For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred `Yes' is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers his own world" (27). Zarathustra teaches man that God is the result of an act of creation, that man is capable of willing new gods and goals. He says: "this god whom I created was man-made and madness, like all Gods!" (33). Zarathustra might be called the God of the Body as he claims that it was originally the sick and decaying who hated the body and nature and subsequently created heaven. Zarathustra provides and alternative: "Listen rather, my brothers, to the voice of the healthy body: that is a more honest and purer voice. More honestly and purely speaks the healthy body that is perfect and perpendicular: and it speaks of the meaning of the earth" (33). Zarathustra warns man of the power of `Good and Evil,' of preachers of virtues and the soul. However, for all of man's creative efforts in conjuring systems of value, man still is left without a clear goal. Zarathustra concludes the first book by insisting that he will only return when his listeners have denied him, for he desires to cultivate an independence of thought.In the second book, Zarathustra returns and begins to speak about creation and pitying. In the second section (Upon the Blessed Isles), he argues that "God is a conjecture; but I desire that your conjectures should not reach beyond your creative will. Could you create a god? Then do not speak to me of any gods. But you could well create the overman [...] of the overman you could recreate yourselves: and let this be your best creation" (86). For Zarathustra, creation is the solution to redeem man from his suffering. Additionally, man's will to power is a potentially liberating capacity. In the fifth section, Zarathustra critically examines different conceptions of traditional virtue. He says: "you are too pure for the filth of the words: revenge, punishment, reward, retribution" (94). After much vivisection and refutation, Zarathustra moves into a discussion of the possible meaning of existence for man in the section On the Tarantulas. Here, he makes a proposal: "For that man be delivered from revenge, that is for me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms" (99). Zarathustra warns man to mistrust all who have a powerful inclination to seek revenge and enact punishment.In book three, Zarathustra continues his prophetic teachings to mankind, though he insists that he is "Godless" (170). He reflects about the absence of having a true audience; one gets the impression that Zarathustra is echoing Nietzsche's loneliness as a largely unrecognized philosopher and writer. He continues with a transvaluation of all values wherein Zarathustra declares the `three best cursed things,' which are: "sex, the lust to rule, [and] selfishness" (188). He condemns Christianity's disapproval of these things, arguing that sex represents a happiness of the body, the lust to rule is a variant of the will to power, and selfishness is a mode of self enjoyment. Zarathustra is concerned that the dominant institutions of our time have conditioned human beings to hate and fear themselves. Additionally, he teaches man about man's ultimate purpose, which he describes in the third section of `The Old and New Tablets,' where he writes: "There it was too that I picked up the word `overman' by the way, and that man is something that must be overcome-that man is a bridge and no end" (198). For Zarathustra, a going under is a crossing over, a transition. In this way, mankind is taught to confront his own mortality.In `The Convalescent,' Zarathustra rests for seven days after a collapse in his cave. He is upset with the animals for watching him in pain, for pain and cruelty (whether it is directed inward or outward) is the greatest flaw of man. It is here that Zarathustra gives his most profound teaching: "Alas, man recurs eternally! The small man recurs eternally!' Zarathustra has established his reason for being: to teach the eternal recurrence of the same. All events and beings of the universe have existed an infinite number of times and will continue to repeat eternally. Zarathustra claims: "I myself belong to the causes of the eternal recurrence. I come again, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent-not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: I come back eternally to this same, selfsame life, in what is greatest as in what is smallest, to teach again the eternal recurrence of all the things" (221). It is because of the eternal recurrence of the same that mankind should affirm life and will subsequently overcome nihilism. Zarathustra expresses a desire that mankind embrace himself as such, and to be willing to act as a bridge for something greater. He declares: "You are mere bridges: may men higher than you stride over you. You signify steps: therefore do not be angry with him who climbs over you to his height" (283). According to Zarathustra, it is only since God has died that mankind can be resurrected. In `On the Higher Man,' Zarathustra announces the life of the overman, an indication of a higher being able to climb over man. Zarathustra announces: "O my brothers, what I can love in man is that he is an overture and a going under [...] Overcome these masters of today, O my brothers-these small people, they are the overman's greatest danger" (287). Human beings must, in accordance with their nature, be willing to go down in order to go across. They are the bridge to something higher. The thought of eternal return contains many facets and implications. One the one hand, the notion of eternity without the trajectory of a goal and without a definitive close could be viewed as the essence of nihilism or pessimism. However, this is not a complete thought of eternal recurrence. Yet if the thinker understands the relation between nihilism and the eternal recurrence of the same, he can fully affirm life.

I was surprised when I read this little known Orwell gem to find that it is in many ways superior to 1984 and Animal Farm. For one thing it is an absolutely first rate account of the Spanish Civil War which is a difficult subject to apprehend because of the massive propoganda of the party literature, as Orwell notes in the text. Some may find the more strictly political sections a bit tedious (Orwell actually warns the reader about such segments) to get through, but for those interested in the politics of the revolution they are intelligently expressed and carefully put together. But Homage to Catalonia is such an amazing and complex blend of everything Orwell; it is a deeply human and observant depiction of war and struggle, it is a political document, a scathing assesment of power and manipulation, and a satirical commentary on the follies of war. Why this over-looked classic is not mentioned in the same breath as 1984 and Animal Farm is beyond me.

This great and slowly moving novel remains one of the final great works in the English Romantic tradition. D.H. Lawrence's conservative style almost wants to remain in the pre-industrial world. This wonderful novel is both an oedipal portrait of a bourgois mother and her domestic conflicts with her mismatched and drunken husband and her future attempts to conserve her possession over her children. Paul Morel is the central figure, whose life revolves around his struggle with his love of two women and his devotion to his mother. Sons and Lovers is at its core about the dehumanizing effects of the modern world. It is no longer possible to live in peace and harmony with ones environment. Man has now been reduced to his functions. Although this novel does not really get going until the second half, the final passages remain some of the finest of English writing. A great though often dreary classic.

'Walkabout,' is a film that is so easily reducible to its basic themes-the ignorance of colonialist settlers, the clash of civilizations, and perhaps even the loss of innocence. Yet at it's core I think the film is still effective today because it is so enigmatic-Peter Roeg's direction glides across oppressive landscapes and the characters appear to mumble rather than pronounce. The breakdown of communication is crucial to the accumulation of incommensurable elements. In the end, there is no contact, and everyone is in some sense broken. A fine achievement with many resonances today.

How can anyone summarize even a single volume of Proust's massive six volume novel? Within a Budding Grove (sometimes translated as In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower) is the second installment of In Search of Last Time. We find the narrator perhaps marginally older on vacation with his grandmother living in a luxurious hotel in Balbec off the coast. This volume, paired with the first (Swann's Way), is really the introduction to the work entire if you can believe it. In it, the narrator perhaps matures slightly; he cultivates his keen awareness of art, meets new people, and ultimately falls out of love with Gilberte and falls in love with Albertine. His relationship with his grandmother is certainly expanded, and the reader comes to learn that the narrator is not merely motivated by a trivial pursuit of pleasure and bourgeois charm. He is in fact, a truly full human being, complete with fear, love, desire, and ambition. He meets one of my favorite characters in the whole book, the impressionist painter Elstir, a character clearly based Monet, Manet, Pissaro, and others. He introduces the narrator to Albertine through his paintings, and teaches him about the joys of life and art. There are some passages in this section of the book (the latter half) which I just can't resist from quoting,"I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was no more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had felt so intensely the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon his canvas, the imperceptible ebb of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and at the sight of this magic portrait, one could think of nothing else than to range the wide world, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty" (pg. 657).also (how French is this?),"For a convalescent who rests all day long in the flower-garden or an orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes sweeten in the sun. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and sunning themselves, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague dazzlement that had spread from brain to eyes" (pg. 669).I certainly cannot add any insights into the greatness and profundity of this work which has not already been said by Edmund Wilson or Vladimir Nabokov. Within a Budding Grove is a deeply felt, beautiful and fleeting segment of one of the finest novels of the last century, I urge you to read it.

The final installment of Proust's grand `a la recherche du temps perdu' is a masterful and eloquent meditation on art, on the loss of love, and on the complex and enigmatic quality of experiencing relationships over the course of a lifetime. This is the period, the final breath of literary genius from the great Marcel Proust, who devoted his life to this great novel.In `Time Regained,' the reader is permitted an extraordinary prolegomena on the writer's craft, a self-reflexive exposition of the literary form that prefigures post-modernity and the works of Brecht, Breton, Beckett, and all the rest of them. Proust creates a work that is more exacting, more precise and perspicacious than any work of aesthetic philosophy in the western tradition. He discloses that the art of writing is, in its essence, an act or translation.The artistic content is already contained within the mind and soul of the artist and the act of writing is an act of transporting the content to form.This is a novel about time, and it requires time to read. In this way, Proust the reader develops a relationship with the work within the register of a temporal horizon, which mirrors the register of temporality internal to the characters and unfolding of the fictional universe that Proust has created. It is a joy to read.Also included in this volume is Kilmartin's guide to Proust, a summation of all the central characters, events, and allusions in a la recherch&eacute; for readers who (inevitably) get lost in Proust's complex literary web.

This is a competent guide for new students of Heidegger, though it is necessarily crude to have to simplify and reorganize his thinking. The chapter death, time, and history is probably the most helpful, for it is some of Heidegger's most challenging material. Also included are essays on Heidegger's thoughts on psychotherapy, ecology, Buddhism, and technology. Although the essay on Heidegger's politics is fairly amateurish. An average text on the whole.

Colette's late novella is the story of the renunciation of eros. Breaking through to her final conclusion, Colette finally abandons the heartache of romantic love in the name of living a life devoted to the beauty and enduring vastness of nature. Colette's prose is a sublime construction-a woven fabric emanating from a deeply felt, naturalistic sensibility. Her descriptions of the changing of the light, of the fineness of the sand and of the convulsions of the romantic psyche are incomparable. This poetic "memoir" is sui generis-it is a love letter, an act of betrayal, a poetic epiphany.

Moby-Dick is a sprawling, unwieldy yet very great novel about the obsessive pursuit of happiness and fulfillment. "Call me Ishmael..." the famous opening lines establishes the omniscient narrator for this whale of an epic. The novel is filled with remarkable characters; their composite comradery is a true achievement of writing. Melville's insistence on explicating precise technical minutia on the craft of whaling and oceanography turned off most readers when the book was initially published (these sections still turn off most who dare penetrate this tome), yet it is really these sections that allow the reader to become immersed in the world of Ahab, the deranged symbol of evil amidst the beauty and sublime grace of the sea. Melville was an undisputed master of literary style, and this masterpiece is difficult to place for the simple reason that its' incomprehensible scale defies categorization. This is a reader's book; it is a divine allegory, a conventional adventure, and a bewitching construction all at once. Not for the weak minded.

Often overlooked, this concise exploration of origins and manifestations of anxiety is often brilliant and provocative. Freud explores the basic properties of fear, anxiety, and touches on the sexual component of these human states of mind/body. Freud hypothesizes that the origin of anxiety is founded in the repressed memory of the human's separation from the mother's originary nutrition during the act of birth. All manifestations of anxiety are (in essence) a resurgence of this primal fear. This is crucial to the role of biology and nourishment to psychoanalysis, often glossed over in its modern variants.

Henry Roth was a truly talented writer and I feel frustrated as a reader that there are only a few books of his to read. However, "Call it Sleep," is a wonderfully full and vibrant novel about a poor Eastern European Jewish family that settles in the Lower East Side slums of New York. David is the protagonist, a small, fearful, and imaginative boy who must contend with the fast moving intensity and danger as a foreigner in New York. He is surrounded by moving characters, such as his brutish and impatient father, who struggles to support his family or Aunt Bertha, the sanguine flirt who represents the peace and comfort of the old world. I don't ordinarily enjoy these kinds of sociological novels, but Roth is able to conjure up breathtaking images, and he paints his canvas with fascinating dialects with encompass the multi-culturism of American life. "Call it Sleep," is truly a neglected piece of depression-era literature.

`Civilization and its Discontents' is Freud's miniature opus. It is a superficial masterpiece that stretches further than any of his other works; he is reaching for an explanation for human nature in terms of the id-ego-superego structure of the individual as he exists in civilization. For Freud, human beings are characterized by Eros (Sex Drive) and Thanatos (Death Drive), which remain in opposition to one another. This small book is filled with as many interesting ideas as any work of modern philosophy. Freud adopts (perhaps a bit hastily), a Nietzschean position with regard to the role of religion and institutions of social morality which curb and shape primordial human drives. As a result, human beings, and civilizations as a whole remain unsatisfied and suffer from neuroses. He concludes with a discussion of human aggression, which manifests itself in the form of communalized human aggression. He wonders as to whether or not human beings will be able to overcome this drive. It seems to me that this question remains the most important for human beings in the 21st century. Will we be able to overcome our Thanatos and survive the destructive powers that we have created? I suspect that Freud will be better remembered as a thinker and philosopher than as an analyst or doctor precisely because he asks the questions that remain relevant for civilization today, and are likely to remain imperative in the future.

'Code of the Woosters' is frequently cited as P.G. Wodehouse's best entry in the Bertie and Jeeves series. It is a deliciously funny and clever little novel, revolving around the acquisition of an antique cow creamer. Bertie summarizes his pickle perfectly:"Right. Now then. Item One-Aunt Dahlia says that if I don't pinch that cow-creamer and hand it over to her, she will bar me from her table, and no more of Anatole's cooking.''Yes, sir.''We now come to Item Two-vis., if I do pinch the cow-creamer and hand it over to her, Spode will beat me to a jelly.''Yes, sir.''Furthermore-Item Three-if I do pinch it and hand it over to her and don't pinch it and hand it over to Harold Pinker, not only shall I undergo the jellying process alluded to above, but Stiffy will take that notebook of Gussie's and hand it over to Sir Watkyn Bassett. And you know and I know what the result of that would be. Well, there you are. That's the set-up. You've got it?'Yes, sir. It is certainly a somewhat unfortunate state of affairs." (106).Revealing much more of the humor involves revealing more of the plot, which I won't do. I will simply say that Wodehouse was one of the literary comic greats of his time. This novel is a good place to start.

This huge work is the foundation of classical liberalism; it is the basis for Locke, for Smith, and all economic neo-liberalists all the way up to the current period. Written during the English Reformation, Hobbes was confronted with the problem of absolute individualism; he begins this work of political theory with a demolishment of objective truth swift enough to impress any post-modernist. He then proceeds to demonstrate the logical conclusion of man in a state of nature, and compels the modern world to enter into his social contract, or Leviathan out of necessity and fear. It is tempting to write off Hobbes as a cynic, but who can deny that much of what motivates individuals in the modern world is simply a fear to maintain survival and acceptance. It is the driving force of modern societies in terms of economic competition, and inter-national conflicts. Hobbes was a thinker of true depth and insight, though his ideas are so commonly ingrained in modern society that it is difficult to see why they were revolutionary when they were composed.

kingsley Amis' established himself as a literary celebrity in England with the publication with this short work of comedy, which would continue to occupy a comfortable niche in the academic-farce 'genre' for the duration of the trend. Yet I found Lucky Jim terribly stiff and antiquated; it lacks any of the satirical wit that it must have possessed during time of its publication. We are asked to follow a fairly inept junior professor through a series of contrived situations at a major university amidst a cast of comic-book-esque academic types. I suspect that this brief whimsy will be an object of sociological curiosity rather than a highly regarded work of literature. Kingsley has the ability to reveal the absurdity of a given culture. He does not however, have the ability to make it pulsate with life and mystery the way his son can.

Lukacs' critique of modernism accurately reflects the socio-historical strictures of vulgar Marxism. All deviations from realist representations of "The Social Totality" are identified with bourgeois ideology, and are therefore mere acts of reification, ideology, or false consciousness. While not as dogmatic as the worst social realists, Lukacs has placed literature in an aesthetic straightjacket, which is probably why he misses the formal beauty of figures like Joyce, Kafka, or Beckett. While the essays in this volume represent an important contribution to the debate on realism within the critical theory tradition, one can't help but feel that something is fundamentally misguided in its approach. Although Lukacs is correct when he says that radical aesthetics is not equivalent to radical politics (the examples of aesthetic radicalism coupled with reactionary politics are too numerous to recount), it is nevertheless dangerously nave to castigate aesthetic experimentation in the name of revolutionary consciousness.

Lawrence Durrell's third novel in his Alexander Quartet is larger and more political in scope than its predecessors. This time the narrative is focused on a British diplomat named Mountolive who has been stationed in Egypt. He has an affair with the mother of Nessim and Narouz, and the action takes us back to the original collection of characters from Justine after several years of build-up. Mountolive is a work that grounds Durrell's foot firmly into the cultural and historical framework of his environment; Alexandria is no longer a phantasm of his mind, he successfully fills it with depth and time, thus expanding the quartet in scale and feeling.

How can I possibly write a brief review about the greatest and most significant work of philosophy of the 20th century? I can't of course. However, I can make some brief comments. First, for those of you who have never read Heidegger, you should. This text will force you to confront your life. It will change the way you think about the world and human existence. Heidegger's existentialized phenomenology is a radicalization of the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, with the question regarding the meaning of Being as its ultimate goal. Yet in order to adequately pose the question of the meaning of Being in general, Heidegger must first investigate the being of the one who is able to pose the question, namely Dasein, or human existence. What follows is a mordantly brilliant destruktion of the history of western metaphysics. We are left with an irreversible transformation of the understanding of Being and existence. A few words on the revised Stambaugh translation. There are a few improvements, and a few disadvantages. Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit have been translated as `objective presence' and' handiness,' rather than the previous `ready-to-hand' and `present-at-hand.' One can see that the former is more elegant, but I still think some of the sense of the German is lost in places. However, Stambaugh often includes German terms in brackets. This is proving to be a more authoritative edition of Being and Time every year in philosophy programs. And there are good reasons why. Still, be sure to consult both in order to see where things have been altered in inadequate ways. Don't miss this astonishing masterpiece.

With an air of smug narcissism, a trio of post-war Americans seek the exotic in North Africa. A love triangle develops, which progresses into a story about jealousy and betrayal, though without any traces of melodrama. Bowles' famous novel is beautifully composed; the vibrancy of the landscape is reminiscent of early Hemingway. In a way, the Sheltering Sky is a rewriting of the Sun Also Rises, though it is an inversion. We are faced with the inevitability of understanding and compassion, and the only natural consequent is destruction. This is a powerful and consuming novel written in elegant and lyrical prose. It is now something of a forgotten classic.

This collection of stories by Cortazar is an extraordinary testament to his brilliance as an inventor of the fantastical. Ranging from brief, elliptical, even metaphysical observations to the mysterious and tragic, Cortazar is a master of the short story form. In "Axolotls" Cortazar develops his style as a brilliant phenomenologist-a true observer of the natural world and its profound mysteries. I am particularly drawn to stories like "The Pursuer" and "At Your Service," because of their combined sense of the strange and the minute particular. This is modern literature at its most interesting and exciting.

It is impossible to distill the complex mysteriousness of this great work in a review. Faulkner's 'Absalom, Absalom!' is perhaps his most difficult and experimental novel-a novel that is composed entirely in thickly wrought stream of consciousness prose, with switching perspectives and an a linear chronology. It is too simple to call this great work "Southern Gothic," for it is so foreign in its conception and is a radical departure from the kind of writers Faulkner is normally associated (O'Connor, McCullers, Anderson). Rather, this text is closer to Joyce's 'Ulysses,' in terms of its linguistic complexity and attention to the labyrinthine workings of the mind. This is a novel about ruin, about decay, about what it means to be a part of a deteriorating empire. It is both political and personal, as all the great tragedies are. Through an inspired interplay of interior voice and secondary hearsay, Faulkner creates the story of Henry Sutpen and the gradual decline of his once prestigious family. This is a novel about slavery, about incest and miscegenation. It is American in its content in only the most horrifying ways. It is an incomparable literary achievement.

This collection of Walser stories gives you a rough estimate of his creative project-namely, an accumulated micro-portrait of a life devoted to wanderings, observations, and obscurity. Walser was a literary genius whose life is shrouded in madness and tragedy-but his fiction is teeming with poetic life. These sublime musings are musical and woven with sinuous transitions and appellations of the ordinary. They are at once miniatures but they are never strictly minimalist. One could go on and mention his impact on such giants as Kafka, Benjamin, and the like, but you should simply discover the brief texts for yourself. Christopher Middleton's translations are faithful, but occasionally awkward. There is no easy way to translate Walser, but they are still worth reading even if one hasn't any German.

Mailer's memoir is sui generis- it is an unbelievably arrogant exercise in self-creation. Although Mailer complicates the relation of the work to the creator through an eclectic compilation of self-portraits, self-criticisms, and self-praise, this is still a deeply troublesome book. Mailer's self-aggrandizements probably did more harm than good, though it was clearly inherent in the psychology of his creativity. What emerges here is an interesting portrait of the self-creation of a writer-and writers who are interested in problems of method and strategy should read it, because Mailer makes you believe you can produce magic through developing the proper disposition. An esoteric work, with a wide variety of writing.

Rousseau's 'Confessions' is a rarely intimate reflection of a classical philosopher's life and observations. The Confessions is also a sort of aesthetic precursor to Flaubert and Proust, a kind of interior amalgam of social reflection. Rousseau lived as exciting a life as practically anyone-he was friendly with the giants of his era, Voltaire, Diderot, D'lambert. He was also a bitter and paranoid provocateur who split with these figures as well as the enlightenment project as a whole. I honestly found sections of this text hard going, but I find it fascinating for its preoccupation with the text itself. Rousseau indicates that his life had been meaningless until he had begun writing his 'Confessions,' an admission of the centrality of this project to his life as a whole. Rousseau remains an admirable thinker for his clarity and honesty. Although he was pretty insane by the time he wrote the 'Confessions,' it remains a wildly entertaining and illuminating entry into the mind of one of our greatest minds.

'The Savage Mind' is probably the best known work of structural anthropology despite its difficult and technical nature. Levi-Strauss is searching for the universal structures of myth in archaic societies-through in application of Saussure's theory of signification, Levi-Strauss seeks to reveal the underlying process of mythological signification. The difficulty lies in Levi-Strauss' privileging of the synchronic over the diachronic-his approach removes the temporal aspect anthropological inquiry. There are interesting revelations in this text, such as the claim that the content of myth is arbitrary and infinitely variable. However, Levi-Strauss' attempts to reach the universal structure of myth have proven to be erroneous by all contemporary accounts. Still, this text is an important object of the history of 20th century structuralism.

John Cheever's fine, woven prose is the perfect fit for this novel about an eccentric family living in along the coast of Massachusetts. St. Boltophs is a fictional town, where the Wapshots, a declining though still respected east-coast family reside. At its heart, this novel is about a contrasting pair of brothers, Moses and Coverly as they live under the fading light of their father Leander. Moses is the ambitious brother who marries into money, and Coverly is the sensitive, if a bit timid brother who also falls into a tragic marriage. There are fine moments of writing in this novel-Cheever's attention to voice and detail is among the strongest of American writers. Though this is far from a great book, it is clearly a fine achievement and well worth reading.

`Life of the Mind,' while incomplete, nevertheless serves as a phenomenal exegesis of Western thought from one of the leading political and metaphysical thinkers of our era. Arendt breezes through an exorbitant quantity of philosophy with remarkable clarity and grace in this two-volume work. In it she provides a critical review of classical thought, including Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Dons Scotus, leading all the way up to Kant and Rousseau. She also explicates the notion of the Will in Nietzsche, and then Heidegger's `Will-Not-to-Will' in his later thought. It is possible that Arendt will remain among the greats in Western philosophy, political theory, and journalism more broadly. Her depth of knowledge and insight and capacity to read a text with fresh eyes will astonish you. Also included in the second volume of the text is one of the most cogent explications of Heidegger's Being and Time you are ever likely to find.

Cahiers Du Cinema most far and away the most important film magazine during the 50's and 60's. It contained the film theories of Bazin, Truffaut, Godard, Rivette, and all the other pioneers who forged the New Wave. This collection contains excellent and extensive intellectual essays on Rossellini, Mizoguchi, Mann, Hitchcock, and many other directors who made the 50's such an extraordinary and rich period of cinematic creativity. Jacques Rivette has a magnificent essay on the dimensions of cinemascope, and Godard has such an enthusiastic piece on Nicholas Ray, it probably contributed to his belated stardom as an auteur.This is an important collection for any serious film student.

Gayatri Chekravorty Spivak has done justice to this famous (some would say infamous) work of philosophy and literary theory. Derrida's Grammatology exploded like an intellectual bomb in American and European literary circles upon its publication, and it has remained the source of considerable debate and often vituperative outrage within the halls of academe. Derrida questions the Western privileging of speech over writing through a deconstruction of modern structuralism. A sustained and nuanced reading of Saussure, Levi-Strauss, and Rousseau reveals an ethnocentrism and logocentrism determined by a classical metaphysical understanding of being as presence. But Derrida proposes the centrality of the play of absence and presence as the horizon of significance and meaning, of 'Differance.' With a collapsing of the clean Saussurean distinction between the signifier and the signified, Derrida presents the 'gramme,' the mark, as a productive force in signification. "A writing that breaks with the phone radically is perhaps the most rational and effective of scientific machines; it no longer responds to any desire or rather it signifies its death to desire. It was what already operated within speech as writing and machine. It is the represented in its pure state, without the represented, or without the order of the represendted naturally linked to it." 'Of Grammatology is a crucially significant development in 20th century thought. A knowledge of Heidegger, Freud, Nietzsche, Plato, Rousseau, Saussure, and Levi-Strauss is assumed.

The question of Heidegger and politics has plagued (and will continue to plague) continental philosophy since Heidegger's induction into the Recktorship under the Nazi regime in the thirties.Why did he? But, and perhaps more importantly, why does something like Nazism come up? What is it about the West that breeds this kind of pathological racism? And how could Heidegger, for all his time concerned with, and working on authenticity and inauthenticity get swept up in the most inauthentic political movement of the century?For Derrida, this kind of fascistic-nationalistic racism is not a problem of facticity, it is a problem of Spirit (Geist). Heidegger avoids the question and problem of Spirit, and it is a failure of his fundamental ontology and onto-theology.This is a fascinating lecture from the late Derrida, who investigates Heidegger in new and unfamiliar modes. He relates (what he and the majority of others perceives to be) Heidegger's avoiding (vermeiden), of the question of Spirit ( Hegelian Geist). Avoiding means the saying without saying, the writing without writing, using words, without using them."No one ever speaks of spirit in Heidegger" (pg.4), well now Derrida has provided us with the speaking."The question of spirit must be recognized in indifference" (pg. 19), and Derrida performs this with remarkable coolness, though not lucidity.This lecture is about spirit, about politics, about Europe, and about language. All students of Heidegger should read it, as it is one of the best.

The first of the bard's great Henry tetrology does not have the power or greatness of the its titular character to the extent that the latter plays have, but it still contains some of Shakespeare's greatest soliloquies. Richard II orates famously:Of comfort no man speak:Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyesWrite sorrow on the bosom of the earth;Let's choose executors and talk of wills:And yet not so -- for what can we bequeathSave our deposed bodies to the ground?Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,And nothing can we call our own but death,And that small model of the barren earthWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones.Richard the II is a tragedy about folly, about the farce of monarchical politics. It is clearly ahead of its time, though it falls short of the philosophical depth that Shakespeare would reach in such masterpieces as Hamlet and Macbeth. An indispensable part of the canon all the same.

Andre Gide's small confession is a key work of French modernism. In a way this novel is a precursor to Camus' Stranger, though it is much more elegant and subtle than the latter.Michel is the titular Immoralist, a man determined to live life fully without the arbitrary constrictions of religion or morality. He is recently married to a woman he admits he does not love; but when he falls ill to tuberculosis her loving comfort wins him over.Together they travel throughout the beautiful coast of Italy, and later off of Michel's inherited farm and land. Gide's prose is both sensual and dark; we know through Michel's subtle ruminations and interactions that he is illicitly attracted to young boys. What is brilliant about 'The Immoralist,' is Gide's refusal to centralize this topic; rather, he constantly pushes it to the margins in the same way that Michel's unconscious remains obscure.This work is an essential and very beautiful work of modern French literature; it will be read and studied for many ages to come.

While I have little to say about the anthropological veracity of this seminal text, I am capable of recognizing its vast aesthetic and intellectual beauty. Levi-Strauss places himself (or inserts himself), in a number of so called 'savage' tribes in Brazil- the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib. This is also an anthropological memoir, Levi-Strauss retraces his training in philosophy to his break and subsequent beginnings as a professor of anthropology in Brazil. This is a universal text by a man searching for universal structures of meaning. He poses questions that remain central to the role of the anthropologist to this day. How can the observer not also be an intruder? What is the basic object of inquiry? Can one avoid proselytizing ones subject? Levi-Strauss is searching for the purely human society, which he finds perhaps most completely in the Nambikwara. "Whether traditional or degenerate, this society offered one of the most rudimentary forms of social and political organization that could possibly be imagined." Is this search an essential rejection of the West? In the final analysis, Levi-Strauss laments the eventual disintegration of the purely human society. A beautiful an important (albeit dated) text.

Masterful work of Italian neo-realism by the grand old man, Roberto Rossellini and filmed in war-torn Berlin and widely regarded as the precursor to Rossellini's 50's masterpieces.A young boy is manipulated by his teacher who later turns out to be an appalling Nazi sympathizer who manipulates the boy into murdering his father.Mesmerizing and always stylized and breathtaking form. This film conveys the horror and destructive inevitability of war far better than the gross Hollywood extravaganza's of the Longest Day variety.Rossellini was criticized by the neo-realists for injecting greater melodrama and lighting control than was though appropriate, but the film still exists in a magnificent documentary style, and it runs circles around DeSica's Umberto D.

'Balthazar' picks up where Durrell left off in 'Justine' not chronologically, but from a different perspective. The doctor Balthazar has paid a visit to the narrator of Justine, and gives him a text called the Great Intilinear, which details what has already unfolded in the previous novel. The fact that Lawrence Durrell was trying to explore the idea of relativity in the Alexandria Quartet is almost completely inconsequential to what makes it any good. What remains interesting in this text is his rich prose and broad canvas. He his building a world that is situated in both the real and the imaginary. Even as 'Balthazar' devolves into elements of Orientalism, it remains an extremely fine novel.

This collection of Robert Stone stories is a deeply felt, often beautiful arrangement of fictions dealing with the great themes of Conrad, Hemingway, but also without the obligatory machismo. "Helping," in particular, is an extraordinary story--masterfully crafted and with a beautiful command of negative space. Stone's preoccupations are with the possibility of heroism in the modern world, the nature and contradictions of piety and faith, the tragedy of addiction, as well as American hubris and stupidity. "Under the Pitons" is a particularly engaging story that doesn't shy away from the conventions of the sea-adventure--Stone employs his tropes strategically and with obvious skill. "Bear and his Daughter" takes you to the fullest depths of tragedy--its precision of feeling lies in the kind of command of character rarely seen in American short fiction today. An outstanding collection.

This is of course an analytic philosopher's history of western philosophy, which means that Russell presupposes that there is a single rational goal which all philosophers are seeking to reach through collective progress. Unfortunately, philosophy is not mathematics, nor is it science. Russell's account is sometimes troubling, sometimes funny, as he methodically points out every logical error in the Ancient Greeks, the rationalists, the empiricists, etc. The notion of progress as it pertains to philosophy is always problematic. Granted, Russell examines each thinker in their socio-historical perspective, but he fails to give credit to the work and creativity of the thinkers as ends in themselves, not particles of a universal human project. This is not to say that a history of Western philosophy should be all adulation, but it should never be exclusive. Russell is quick to dismiss all religious thinkers as absurd (which isn't that far off the mark), but also treats Nietzsche with supreme cruelty as Nietzsche was a thinker that broke from the Enlightenment tradition and refused to play with numbers. Similarly, Heidegger is a glaringly absent in Russell's account, as he refused to admit that there was any seriousness to Heidegger's thought. This sentiment is more a reflection of philosophy's break between the analytic and the continental modes of thought than it is an honest criticism. This book does have valuable information and it does represent fairly competent historical research. But it should be read always be read as Bertrand Russell's history of Western philosophy, not THE history of Western philosophy.

David Cronenberg's Siamese-twin freak show with Jeremy Irons playing two gynecologists at the peak of their profession. One brother, the more manipulative of the two, seduces women and then passes them off to his brother when he grows bored.However, they encounter a woman who manages to captivate them both; sounds conventional from here right? Come now, it's Cronenberg.The film progresses into a totally bizarre pastiche of self-mutilation, deception, and murder, all set to the tone of the invasive nature of gynecology.Jeremy Irons is absolutely excellent as the twin brothers as he is able to convey which brother is which in every scene of the film despite their identical looks and voice. The subject matter however, is simply too creepy for most tastes.

Cormac McCarthy has risen to stardom in the past few years through the esteem of several major critics, and through the very fine adaptation of No Country for Old Men. Blood Meridian is widely regarded as his finest work, and I don't disagree. It is an extremely dark and well crafted vision of the barbarism of the West, with particular emphasis on the brutality of the U.S. in its conquest of Mexico. We are given unfathomable acts violence and hatred amidst the landscape of godless oblivion. However, I'm increasingly inclined to feel that McCarthy is a one-note writer; his persistent need to repel is strange and often uninteresting. Although he is truly capable of telling a good tale, his characters are often flat caricatures. Although very good, to call Blood Meridian another 'Iliad' or 'Moby Dick' is simply hyperbole.

"What is phenomenology? It may seem strange that this question has still to be asked half a century after the first works of Husserl" So says Merleau-Ponty in the opening pages of `Phenomenology of Perception,' perhaps the major work of phenomenology after `Being and Time.' Merleau-Ponty sought, rather brilliantly, to redirect attention to the human body as the locus of our being-in-the-world for phenomenological inquiry. Unfortunately, I am convinced that Merleau-Ponty's efforts to turn the results of his phenomenology into an ethics and a politics are less impressive and important than Heidegger's breathtakingly brilliant attempt to use phenomenology as a means to fundamental ontology. Still, one has to admire Merleau-Ponty's command over biology and the natural sciences. His descriptions of visual illusions and phantom limbs are by now established classics of the field. However, many of his examples are needlessly extensive and dense. Less committed readers should turn to the final chapters of the book, where the majority of his philosophy can be found.As a side note, Routledge has produced an edition here that is positively replete with typos. Surprising for such a reputable publisher. Most readers will find the carelessness on their behalf extremely irritating.

A masterful creation about artistic genius, jealousy, betrayal, and failure. Thomas Bernhard has constructed an immensely readable novel about the competitive relationship between three piano virtuosos, and how Glenn Gould drives the other two into self-abdication. The Loser puts Bernhard's own inimitable voice into the central character as he attempts to piece together the protracted process of descent his friend and colleague falls prey to. This text has astonishingly accomplished portraits of the nature of artistic genius and its strangely bewitching tendencies. In the final analysis, Bernhard asks us-as well as himself-whether or not we can truly face our own insurmountable limitations and appreciate divine genius when we finally encounter it. Unfortunately for his protagonists, and perhaps for himself, the answer to that question is a resounding "No."

This is the most authoritative collection of Kafka's immortal short fiction; it includes the most respected translations of each story (mostly by Willa and Edwin Muir), and a fair introduction from John Updike.Kafka was the greatest writer of short fiction of the modern era. Such stories as 'The Metamorphosis,' 'In the Penal Colony,' 'The Hunger Artist,' and 'The Great Wall of China' encapsulate the tyrannical, dehumanizing regimentation of the modern world. Kafka may be difficult to read, and the allegorical form is not enjoyable for everyone. However, it is impossible to not be drawn into the strange madness of 'The Hunger Artist,' or 'The Country Doctor,' surely two of the most terrifying works of literature of the period.In many ways, Kafka was a precursor to the sort of self-reflexive artistry that would later be found in Beckett, Sartre, and Brecht; Kafka is always aware that he is working within the literary realm, and he knows that he cannot escape it. Therefore, (brilliantly), he turns it into an advantage, by intoning the mystical, the metaphysical, and the surreal. His characters are often animals, metaphors, or simply moods. This approach has its strengths, but only in the hands of a true master. Fortunately for us, Kafka was just that, in the truest sense: a master of form, and unity of content.

Berkeley Professor Hubert Dreyfus assesses the predictions and subsequent failures of artificial intelligence from its inception in the 1960's with innovators like Turing to the present day with a detailed and honest account of why higher level AI is impossible. After evaluating the history of AI's minuscule progress, Dreyfus provides a compelling analysis of human intelligence, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty in order to demonstrate that higher level cognitive faculties are not reducible to computational representations. This book is an important reversal of commonly accepted assumptions within the cognitive sciences, from linguistics to psychology. It is also an important example of why the cognitive sciences would benefit from paying greater attention to the achievements of contemporary European philosophy.

A brilliant, probing, though methodologically suspect work of political ontology that seeks to interrogate the origins and causes of biopolitics in the modern world. Agamben traverses enormous swaths of history with the acumen of a true Renaissance man--his handling of the emergence of the concept of "sacred" life in Rome is particularly skillful and well researched. However, Agamben begins his search with an investigation of the Ancient Greeks--he identifies an originary split and privileging within the concepts of "life." That is, there is an historical disjunction between bios and zoe--the latter of which will turn out to be affixed to the notion of "bare life" which will turn out to reemerge in a new form in the era of biopolitics, with the concentration camps as its undeniable nadir. Classical scholars still dispute the usage of "bios" and "zoe" respectively, and it is not so clear from the historical record that there ever was such a privileging of one over the other with respect to political life. Even if the distinction were true without qualification there is a kind of conceptual determinism that vitiates the plausibility of Agamben's historical methodology. Nevertheless, this book is a fascinating work of speculative political thought--it takes the advances regarding power Foucault had developed and pushes them into more significant regions.

Jean Genet's absorbing work of literary autobiography traverses the boundaries of genre with stunning ingenuity and imagination. This work is in some ways similar to Capote's use of the so-called "non-fiction novel," in that it recalls apparently true events through the lens of fiction. This is the reflection of a petty thief, and vagabond. Genet is a young man wandering Europe and immersing himself in a world of crime and depravity. He fuses his homosexuality with nefarious hooliganism to play off of our civilization's utter contempt for effeminate males. Genet blurs the boundary of morality with Nietzschean fury as he revels in his self projected "evil." Perhaps what is most astonishing about 'The Thief's Journal' is the way in which Jean Genet comments on his own commentary with startling frankness and lucidity. In many ways this work established many of the literary mechanics of what is now referred to as "post-modern," though Genet achieves the same level of complexity without sacrificing clarity or beauty in the process.

A deeply felt and personal short novel about an American ex-patriot who falls in love with another man in Paris. Baldwin establishes an undeniable tension between David's desire for Giovanni and his desire to live a normal life with his fiancee. There are many quiet and subtle moments in 'Giovanni's Room' that are as good as the best sections in early Hemingway. In a way this novel is more personal and reflective than Baldwin's much esteemed 'Go Tell it On the Mountain,' though it clearly does not have the same political involvement with race relations as the latter does. As always, Baldwin's dialogue is largely impeccable, weaving seamlessly from colloquial interactions, to French, to formal and reserved English. Truly a fine literary achievement.

In volume five of Proust's massive and perspicacious `a la recherch&eacute;,' we find the narrator Marcel, slowly, yet surely, falling out of love with Albertine. Proust is extraordinarily masterful at evoking the painful (and yet very real) feeling of gradual disaffection, which all lovers must inevitably face with each other. Marcel pontificates endlessly and relentlessly on Albertine. He loves, her (or maybe we should say him), he doesn't love her, he loves her, he doesn't love her, etc. etc. Until, finally, the moment of decision, he tells her that he does not love her and wishes her to leave, insisting that she will be happier without him. Of course, the moment Albertine departs, Marcel is in despair, he has lost has love, and Albertine is reduced to the status of the `fugitive.' This volume is one of the most beauteous and thoughtful unfolding of the loss of love, and the painful convalescence that transpires in the subsequent period. Marcel goes to Venice, and explores that wondrous and ancient European city, and he sends help to find Albertine, only to discover that she has died in a horseback accident. In addition to the tragic loss of Albertine, Marcel grows continually disenchanted with the aristocratic world to which he belongs. Proust is brilliant in his ability to sustain this massive web of characters, as he reintroduces figures from the early stages of the search, such as Gilberte (Marcel's first love), and Mme Verdurin. This book evokes the meaning of life as it unfolds temporally, and the meaning of relationships throughout the course of a lifetime, and how they change and drift in and out of focus at different stages. It is one of the great works of Western literature.

The first volume of Marcel Proust's massive In Search of Lost Time is arguably the greatest introductory work of literature ever written. This edition is yet another revision of Scott Moncrieff's classic translation, first revised by Terence Kilmartin during the 1980's, and revised yet again by D.J. Enright for further readability; Enright apparently altered a number of the French expressions used by Proust which are fairly ordinary in French but come across as a bit strange in Moncrieff and Kilmartin's initial translation.Swann's Way is simply a wonderful and profound novel. It is often criticized for its lack of a forward moving plot, but such judgments are both unfair and incorrect. While it is true that In Search of Lost Time is a deliberately slow and contemplative work, yet during the first section of Swann's Way set in Combray, Proust is actually quite judicious about introducing the major characters and establishing the most important themes of the work, the themes of time, art, love, and longing. The narrator finds himself having difficulty sleeping and involuntarily recalls the events of his life, he flashes back to his childhood in Combray and Paris, and the novel begins. He reflects on his family, on the Verdurins, on M. Swann, and on his growing love for Gilberte and literature.Swann's way is simply a joy to read. Proust's acute sense of aesthetics, of love, and of the strange inner workings of bourgeois society place him among the true greats of literature right up there with Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Joyce. This edition of Proust's great work of art is highly recommended for those with patience.

Disappointing self-help/literary guidebook that came utterly lavished with positive reviews; The New Yorker said of the book "Curious, humorous, didactic and dazzling...It contains more human interest and play of fancy than most fiction." Maybe I'm missing something or was just looking for something else, but it seems to me that Alain de Botton's book is nothing more than a banal self-help book that is more eloquently written than the other works in this dubious genre. Botton doesn't offer the reader much in the way of literary analysis or explication, rather, he merely uses the life (and scatterings of the work) of Marcel Proust to launch into his mediocre prescriptions for living. Surprisingly, little is actually said about In Search of Lost Time, the author prefers to inundate the reader with scatterings of anecdotes about Proust's health problems and social life. There are a few sections which are worthwhile, such as the great "what if it could have been another way?" conversation between Proust and James Joyce that reads like,"PROUST [while taking furtive stabs at an homard a l'americaine, huddled in his fur coat]: Monsieur Joyce, do you know the Duc de Clermont-Tonnerre?JOYCE: Please, appelez-moi James. Le Duc! What a close and excellent friend, the kindest man I have met from here to Limerick.PROUST: Really? I am so glad we agree [beaming at the discovery of his common acquaintance], though I have not yet been to Limerick.VIOLET SCHIFF [leaning across, with a hostess's delicacy, to Proust]: Marcel, do you know Jame's big book?PROUST: Ulysses? Naturellement. Who had not read the masterpiece of our new century? [Joyce blushes modestly, but nothing can disguise his delight].VIOLET SCHIFF: Do you remember any passages in it?PROUST: Madame, I remember the entire book. For instance, when the hero goes to the library, excuse my anglais, but I cannot resist [starting to quote]: "Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred..." (pg. 112).There is also some interesting discouragement from Virginia Woolf upon reading Proust's great masterpiece,"I detest my own vocabulary. Why be always spouting words? [...] Take up Proust after dinner and put him down. This is the worst time of all. It makes me suicidal. Nothing seems left to do. All seems insipid and worthless." (pg. 187).Unfortunately however, How Proust can Change Your Life is ultimately an overstated, dressed up self-help book with many useless suggestions about how you should live. It is not substantive literary criticism. For the latter, I suggest you seek out the work of Edmund Wilson.

A profoundly beautiful prose poem by the greatest German poet of the 20th century. The notebooks is haunting in its meditative poise-its ghostly luminosity interrogates the nature of death and dying in incomparable prose. Rilke's writing sings in this free floating presentation of decline and mortality. This is also a boldly existential work; we are confronted with the insuperable question of the nature of the self in relation to the world, allowing with its singular potentialities. A tremendous influence for Nietzsche and Heidegger, who would appropriate his extraordinary meditations on mortality in their own radical ways.

Forget Brian DePalma's bloated, overwrought, ill conceived blood-fest, Howard Hawks' original gangster picture is a brilliant and comic symphony of Capone-style gangsterism. The violence is real and Paul Muni is excellent as the swarthy hood in 1920's Chicago. There is as much comedy here as a Marx brothers film, so don't take Hawks' political posturings too seriously. Unlike the genre today, there is little attempt to connect the elements of crime with "deep" "psychic" or "nationalist" causes. Munni simply responds to his violent and macabre environment.

This brief account of eros is beautifully poetic distillation of the multiple instantiations of the logic of eros in ancient Greek philosophy and myth. Carson is a first rate classicist and her powers as an interpreter of ancient Greek texts is abundant here. More importantly, her poetic sensibility illuminates the lightness and complexity of the movement of eros; through readings of Plato, Sappho, and others, a vibrant picture of eros and its place within Greek thought emerges. I was particularly struck with her writing on the temporality of eros, which does so much to encapsulate its paradoxical essence. A supremely beautiful and enlightening text.

Those who find Bukowski's novels a little thin in substance and diversity may want to turn to these early poems, which are indicative of the late writer's considerable talent. Bukowksi's poetry is base, unadorned, and funny. He identifies strongly with the common man, perhaps more authentically than the beats or other subterranean movements of the same period. This collection is a strong representation of his early skill as a craftsman; his voice his genuinely present throughout. Stand out poem is `Genius of the Crowd.'

This is an unbelievably terrible effort at polemicisism by a usually brilliant journalist. Hitchens was, and still is in favor of regime change in Iraq. He accepts the hard-line Neo-Conservative agenda of Wolfowitz and Cheney, and doesn't seem to have any problem with accepting each and every one of their lies.-To begin, Hitchens has no problem with the knowledge that the US has supported Hussein throughout his worst atrocities, and somehow believes that the sudden desire to remove him is the product of noble and benign humanitarian intervention.-Yet later he seems to have no problem with the knowledge that this war is about oil, writing "of course it's about oil, stupid." Hitchens thinks oil is worth fighting for. Are we supposed to accept this from a former Trotskyist? It is worth sacrificing human life for the sake of oil profits for the whores at Halliburton? This is sheer nonsense.-The book is replete with dated material. Hitchens believed that Hussein had WMD, that he had well established ties to Al-Queda, and that the removal of Hussein was necessary for the stability of the region. This is utterly ridiculous.-Long, Short, War is easily Hitchens' worst work of writing, and you shouldn't believe a word of it. The Iraq war is a miserable failure motivated by the forces of greed and barbarity. Hitch never should have stooped to the low level of Bush, Cheney, and all the rest. May he redeem himself in the future and admit the error of his ways.

This deeply cryptic and beautiful little text is perhaps Novalis' most beautiful and complex work. The Novices of Sais unfolds as a hermetic prose poem in which the various approaches to the study and contemplation of nature are discussed and compared. Novalis sees the poetic as the unifying method-as well as that which is nearest to the inner truth of nature. This brief and beautiful text continues to haunt and inspire its readers, its place has been secured in the tradition. Paul Klee's illustrations are characteristically poignant and simple at once.

A dense and superbly constructed novel by Dostoevsky is in many ways more complex than his great 'Crime and Punishment,' though it certainly does not rival the latter in its control of psychological tension. 'The Idiot,' is a highly allegorical novel about Prince Myshkin, a simple and Christ-like man who only contains conventionally moral qualities. Dostoevsky is exploring the theme of the relationship between a purely good man and his society, and reveals that the purely good man brings nothing but ruin to those around him. Rogozhin, the dark and rich man who is Myshkin's rival throughout the story, is the counterpoint to Myshkin's simplicity and goodness. The characters of the 'Idiot,' are often one dimensional ideas; many of the criticisms that Nabokov leveled at 'Crime and Punishment' are actually more evident here. Nevertheless, there are haunting passages describing epilepsy and religious doubt. Dostoevsky proves once again that he is a redoubtable master of blending narrative and penetrating philosophical and theological inquiry.

`Dream Story' is now a famous novella on account of Kubrick's mediocre film `Eyes Wide Shut,' but it remains a fabulous literary exploration of infidelity and the Freudian conceptualization of Eros. After over eighty years, Schnitzler's prose remains fresh and mysterious like a cold, damp Viennese alley. It is the story of a young couple's adventures in infidelity both real and of the unconscious. After a jealous fight, the protagonist leaves his home and wife and wanders the deep recesses of Vienna in search of sexual gratitude and revenge. He encounters a lonely widow, the young promiscuous daughter of a shop owner, and religious orgy. He returns and his wife reveals dreams of infidelity and betrayal. Schnitzler is probing the darker and more painful dimensions of human sexuality, the fact of Eros, the fact of desire, both real and imagined. After a moment of reconciliation the bourgeois home has come full circle; `Dream Story' is brilliant in its ability to be both conventional and provocative. It is a wonderful novella of intrigue, sexuality, and love.

Saul Bellow's slim eulogy to the late Allen Bloom in novel form has its moments, but it is ultimately a superficial achievement. Banking on the colorful eccentricities of the late professor of philosophy, Bellow is content to retreat from anything resembling a story. I preferred the intricate weavings of philosophy, art, and life that Bellow was able to create and Herzog, whereas in Ravelstein he takes it for granted that the subject is supremely interesting to the reader. Still, I admit that Bellow is quite at home in the elite intellectual circles that Bloom liked to frequent at the University of Chicago, and his pedantic monologues about the ancient Greeks, Rousseau, and Machiavelli have a certain amount of resonance. But this is still a well-written puff piece at the end of the day.

In Operation Shylock, Philip Roth once again plays himself. This time he stumbles into a bad mental episode triggered by lousy sleeping pills when he discovers that someone in Israel is imitating him. He heads to Israel to meet is enigmatic doppleganger, and all the while a heavily publicized trial is taking place involving a possible Nazi war criminal. Roth discovers that his doppelganger is a man using his fame to espouse the theory of diasporism, the idea that all of the non-Arabic Jews of the Levant should return to their roots in Europe. This novel is filled with bizarre bits of Jewish ironic comedy. There is an organization called Anti-Semites Anonymous, which is devoted to curing the threat of anti-antisemitism in Eastern Europe. This is a multi-faceted and highly original work of literature, though I found Roth to tread into severe solipsism as the novel's literary devices become more and more introspective and prolegoamatic. Not a great book, but still very interesting.

With this collection of subversive essays, Jacques Derrida exploded onto the scene of post-modern philosophy in Europe and the US though he didn't have a doctorate or teaching position at the time. In it, he demonstrates for the first time his conception of `deconstruction,' an apparently inexplicable concept which enables the analysis of `inter-textuality' and `binary-oppositions,' to be revealed. `Writing and Difference,' is of course a difficult text, and analytic philosophers don't even bother with it, though that may be their greatest mistake, for Derrida attempts (and not without success) to demonstrate that the notion of purely objective, enlightened truth seeking is an impossibility. That the essence of thought always operates within a given schema, a given facticity. "Differance," the famous phrase of Derrida, indicates that writing is necessarily primary to speech, we can see the `differ a nce' in text, not phonetically.The first essay in this collection `Force and Signification,' attempts to apply a philosophical rigour to the analysis of literature, wherein Derrida explains Flaubert, Mallarme, and a number of others. `Cogito and the History of Madness' is an extremely famous essay about Foucault which triggered a feud between the two intellectuals that would never fully be mended. In it, Derrida argues that Foucault's book does not address the Cartesian notion of the Cogito adequately in the History of Madness, and that Foucault ultimately relies on the same principles of the enlightenment while attempting to expose the dynamics of its power simultaneously. The essay (along with violence and Metaphysics) is a perfect example of Derrida's capacity to deconstruct. However, he moves very quickly and without and assistance to the reader. If you have not read the author Derrida is deconstructing he will simply leave you in the dust.The latter essays in the book deal primarily with Artaud, Freud, Bataille, Hegel, Heidegger, Levi-Strauss, and metaphysics and language generally. The essay on Levi-Strauss (Structure, Sign, and Play) is a particularly damning lecture delivered at Johns Hopkins University and left irreparable damages to the structuralist movement at the time. `Writing and Difference' is an important collection of critical texts for 20th century philosophy, and it should remain an important work for many ages to come.

Green Hills of Africa is set (surprise) in Africa, and it primarily concerns hunting for Kudu and Rhino. Hemingway draws you into the realm of the physical; he draws in precise detail the machinery of the rifles, the approach of the rhino, the canvas of Africa's deep and beauteous terrain.There are passages in here of remarkable grit and beauty:"It was a hot place to camp, under trees that had been girdled to kill them so that the se-se fly would leave, and there was hard hunting in the hills, which were steep, brushy, and very broken, with a hard climb before you got up into them, and easy hunting on the wooded flats where you wandered as though through a deer park" (136).This book was published in 1935, and Hemingway's prose had (sadly), already begun to degenerate from the peak of cold and simple beauty that made his early short-fiction classic literature. However, unlike his latest writing, his obvious exuberant happiness and excitement about life and nature seeps onto the page. He employs the ice-berg technique; we get little information about the characters and their lives and situations. Hemingway entices the reader with a miniature portrait of place, and time. It is about man and nature and redemption through physical activity and danger.

Detailed and well researched, Christopher Hitchens unveils a small pamphlet on the life and work of George Orwell, but he rarely explains the significance of Orwell's politics as they relate to the contemporary world. Hitchens is a fine journalist and he compiles some interesting information on Orwell's experiences in Spain, India, and elsewhere, but he rarely provides in-depth political/literary analysis of the man, preferring instead to subject the reader to mildly interesting anecdotes involving various luminaries in the literary/political world. Why Orwell Matters is a minor work, it may interest curious readers who've read 1984 and Animal Farm and would like to know more, but it's far from a serious study.

Lukacs' sordid political history does not entirely overturn this intimidating collection of Marxist essays from the early 20s. With the theoretical exposition of such perplexing notions as "reification" and the "unity of consciousness," Lukacs established much of what was to become critical theory. Despite his disavowed idealism, Lukacs' thinking on the structure of class consciousness is among the most nuanced in the Marxian tradition, and it remains critical to any theoretical understanding of the method of dialectical materialism. While much of his meanderings in "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat" are poorly structured, one can't help but be excited through his detours into the major intellects of German Idealism. Nevertheless, he fails to give a full explanatory account of the relation between materiality and class consciousness. And as a result, his analysis falls right back into Hegelian Idealism.

Frederic Jameson has established himself as one of the leading interpreters of 'Post modernism' over the years, but in this work he turns his attention to a history of the modern. By outlining the variegated meanings and understanding's of the modern, from the Cartesian Cogito, to Marx's Capital, Jameson attempts to reach a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the period itself. However, Jameson falls into web of philosophical and ideological narratives from which he cannot remove himself. Aside from some insightful criticism's of Foucault's 'Episteme,' this work is a confused and superficial work of historiography.

Edmund Wilson famously links the great European and American Modernists of the 20th Century to symbolism, tracing each author to his or her originary soil. Wilson is working very much as an aesthetic historian of literature-he is not particularly concerned with the political or ideological pressures which would push modern literature in various directions. Rather, he looks to classical (and often abstract) aesthetic influences on our modern masters. For Yeats, Wilson determines an ancestry in Mallarme, and for Eliot the influence is Laforgue. Wilson's treatment of Joyce is clearly of note- for it would not be for years before any other American would begin to read 'Ulysses' as anything but a vulgar curiosity. There are brilliant passages in this essay,"we are in the presence of a mind which has much in common with that of a certain type of philosopher, who in his effort to understand the causes of things, to interrelate the different elements of the universe, has reached a point where the ordinary values of good and bad, beautiful and ugly, have been lost in the excellence and beauty of transcendent understanding itself."'Axel's Castle,' is a classic of its form. Although Wilson's treatments of Stein and Rimbaud are less complex, this is still a remarkable work of literary analysis, as well as an indisputable landmark in the history of aesthetic taste.

The theatrical and minimal come together nicely in Fassbinder's study of a lesbian love triangle gone kaput. The film takes place in the enclosed and stifling setting of the fashion-designer's flat-the mise en scene is littered with mannequins and nude paintings. There is extraordinary representation at work here-particularly as to the maniacal element inherent in the fashion world. For many this is Fassbinder's most representative work, and it is indeed a testament to his formal and inventive talents.

Taking a largely vacuous story of a love triangle between a concert violinist and his friend's wife, Renais is able to transcend the limitations of his material through the brilliance of the performances and the exquisite mise en scene. This is a true masterpiece of form, and a genuine testament to the filmmaker's considerable talent.

This is an invaluable translation of thirty of Chekhov's greatest stories, spanning his entire career. Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a truly sublime translation-the strange turns and ambiguities of Chekhov's prose shine through here and the text has been depleted of Victorian English niceties. As for the stories, the major works are here: Ward No. 6, the Bishop, the Student, The Lady with a Little Dog, etc. Chekhov's realism strikes an astonishing balance between the abstract and the concrete-his stories circle around minor details of life which enlarge to occupy his characters unparalleled grace. They are minor explosions of life, and yet he leaves all of its mysteries unsolved.

This brief compendium of Novalis' corpus serves to demonstrate the complexity and depth of though of this early German Romanticist. Known primarily for his poetry, Novalis' philosophy has been overshadowed by the giants of the Romantic period for too long. This little volume gives us a window into the range of topics Novalis was really dealing with, including language, science, politics, and of course poetry. Novalis was the great unifier of our systems, and this small but significant collection will allow us to see him in his creative genius.

In this third volume of Marcel Proust's epic In Search of Lost Time, the narrator gains entrance into the Duc and Duchesse de Gurmante's chateau near Combray and becomes more intimate with the elite Parisian society, he provides a detailed portrait of the mechanics of social interaction and the underlying driving forces that motivate the bourgeoisie. He encounters nobles, officers, aristocrats, and of course his friends Robert de Saint Loup and his prostitute Rachel, and the Baron de Charlus at a number of extravagant and detailed parties. Proust situates the reader in the world that he vividly experienced, and it's a totally absorbing experience. We see Oriane Guermantes calculate every social decision like a four-star general; she refuses to show at the parties which expect her and forces herself into the parties which did not to draw consideration to herself. Guermantes Way is also, somewhat surprisingly a much more political section of the book. It deals with military strategy, with socialism, anti-Semitism, and class struggle. However, unlike the previous volumes, the last one hundred pages slow down to a near stand-still in pure social observation. Readers often cite this section of the work as the most difficult, and their judgment is correct. The pace is simply comatose here, but it picks up again for those with enough patience to get through it. The Guermantes Way is a powerful and beautiful centerpiece to Proust's great novel.

Simply a disaster of investigative journalism. I was very surprised of the low scholarly quality of this book after I had read a favorable review of it from Edward Herman (a political scientist I admire) in the Guardian upon the book's publication. Ms. Johnstone, a Scandinavian journalist, investigates NATO's role in using military intervention after the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990's, in which she speciously argues that the intervention was imperialist in nature despite the ethnic cleansing that was taking place at the time. She deplorably argues that Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milosevic was not a nationalist, rather a socialist who committed few war crimes during the period in question and certainly did not commit an ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population. Her arguments are utterly ridiculous; they are refuted by the UN, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty international, and the people of the region themselves. The factual and scholarly errors in this book are practically limitless. For example, on page 53 she writes, "Such rhetoric inflated into the Cause of the century what was perhaps only a brutal little civil war for control of contiguous territory..." What evidence does she produce to back up her claim? Nothing. Similarly, on page 62 she quotes a statement from NATO, "In February 1996, NATO occupation forces announced the discovery of an Islamic `terror arsenal', including fragmentation bombs disguised as children's toys." The statement is very interesting; unfortunately Ms. Johnstone fails to provide a citation for it. On page 66 she outlines several massacres in Sarajevo in which she claims the Serbs were accused without sufficient evidence, she herself refuses to provide any evidence for the atrocities detailed when they are available in most human rights reports. I guess evidence is always necessary when you're attributing blame but not when you're denying genocide.Ms. Johnstone also makes a particularly ludicrous argument on page 70 in which she argues that the media, paired with America's most influential Jewish organizations, systematically equated the Serbs with Nazis in the public's eye (for no known reason). She writes: "Ruder Finn immediately contacted three major Jewish organizations, the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and the American Jewish Congress, suggesting they publicly protest. They did. This launched the deionization of Serbs as the new Nazis." And what does she cite? A single article from Foreign Policy about Finn's success in helping the Bosnian Muslim clients "dominate" a June 1993 conference on human rights in Vienna. Impressive stuff, and this must prove that the Jewish organizations succeeded in running a public relations campaign to equate the Serbs with the Nazis. Unfortunately, Ms. Johnstone, you need a hell of a lot more evidence to prove it.Similarly, Ms. Johnstone argues that the American public came to believe the hoax because of a fabricated photograph depicting a thin Muslim behind barbed wire, apparently in a Serbian concentration camp. Ms. Johnstone writes that "The extraordinary impact of these pictures depended on the hyped headlines and commentaries that were added by editors who, for all the protests that `it musn't happen again!', seemed eager to announce that indeed it was happening again. Years later, after the `thin man behind barbed wire' photo had been printed in thousands of periodicals and engraved in millions of memories..." What does she cite? Nothing. I'm afraid some more institutional analysis is needed before you can truly claim that a fraudulent photograph has been "engraved in millions of memories," but maybe that's just me.The book only gets worse from there. On page 89 Ms. Johnstone criticizes a U.S. State Department report for essentially no reason. She writes: "On 10 May 1999, the U.S. State Department issued a report entitled `Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo' which, based on refugee accounts and aerial photos, estimated that 90 per cent of Kosovo Albanians had been driven from their homes. This was wildly inaccurate, as it later turned out..." And why was the report "wildly inaccurate"? No reason is given; it just must be because it does not help her argument.Just as began to think that Ms. Johnstone's scholarship could not get any worse I read in chapter 3 on pages 135 that, "A large human rights organization was founded to defend Jansa and his colleagues. It was as representatives of the Jansa defense that several young Slovenian intellectuals toured the Western networks. In the atmosphere created by Germany's big 1980's peace movement, anyone who was jailed for anti-militarism was certain to attract widespread sympathy at that time." Her citation for this is actually quite hilarious, she cites under footnote 16 that "On 24 September 1988, I was visited at my home in Paris by three young Slovenian intellectuals from Ljubljana: Marko Hren (mathematician), Tomaz Mastnak and Braco Roiar (both sociologists). They presented in detail the facts and opinions recounted in these paragraphs." Well that's just terrific Ms. Johnstone! You were visited by two sociologists who told you the facts! Outstanding! Then why don't you provide the facts?I think you get the picture. This book is scholarly junk, and it's an exercise in genocide denial. Furthermore, at no point does Ms. Johnstone provide evidence that NATO intervened for the purposes of globalization. If the left had had their way on this issue the Serbs would have continued to rage on until 500,000 citizens of the former Yugoslavia had been killed. Not very admirable polemics, I'm afraid.

Although often characterized as 'structuralist' Marxism, this crucial work of textual analysis represents the major turning point in Althusser's Marxian project. Through a radical re-reading of Marx's corpus, Althusser posits an 'epistemological break' which splits Marx's corpus into the humanist and scientific division. Althusser provides us with brilliant critical assessments of the U.S.S.R.'s later appropriation of the humanist Marx to obscure it's own totalitarian impulses. 'Contradiction and Overdetermination' is an absolute tour-de-force of Marxian thought; Althusser scrutinizes the minute particulars of the ruptural force inherent in revolutionary transitions, as well as the nuances of levels of affectivity within the superstructure. Althusser wanted to steer us clear of Stalinist reductions regarding 'dialectical materialism,' and to see the radically complex and sophisticated achievement of Marxian science for what it is. This little text is a remarkable contribution to that effort.

A masterfully woven collection of stories by the great minimalist Raymond Carver. Several stories in this collection, namely `A Small Good Thing,' `Feathers,' and `Cathedral' are American classics. Carver employed Hemingway's technique and gave it new life with his sensitive attunement to the struggles and pain of ordinary people. Although many disparage the structure of the epiphany operative within these stories, I find there subtle and revelatory unfolding to be understated and yet sublime. Carver's terse realism is a welcome contrast to the hysterical realism of contemporary prose. A must read for any aspiring short fiction writer.

Wittgenstein's Poker begins with the now legendary confrontation between philosophical heavyweights Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper, which allegedly resulted in Wittgenstein threatening the latter with a red hot poker before the very eyes of such big shots as Bertrand Russell. The book is an examination of the two intellectuals, their background in Vienna, further intellectual pursuits, and finally the classic confrontation. Occasionally the book comes across as an exercise in appealing to bourgeois snobs who want to feel smart simply because of the protagonists and some scattering of analytic philosophy, but who are not willing to turn to the actual works of these men, such as Wittgenstein's Tractatus or Popper's The Open Society. However, Edmonds and Eidinow do a good job with the material; the book is well written and they manage to paint a nice picture of pre-war Vienna and later academic life, and some competent overviews of 20th century philosophy eventually emerge. Still, for anyone who wants to truly understand these men this book isn't great, to the original text for those who are serious.

Excellent preliminary introduction to the thought of French philosopher Michel Foucault, who was situated at the forefront of French post-modernity and post-structuralism during the 1960's, grouped with other intellectuals such as Derrida, Lacan, Althusser, and Delueze.For Foucault, (as it exists in modern societies) power is not an entity to be acquired, it is an instrument that is continually exercised. Power operates as knowledge through discourse, confession, observation, surveillance, etc. "Power for Foucault is not an omnipotent causal principle, or shaping spirit but a perspective concept" (245). Power is used and applied, not obtained.This volume serves as a useful compendium to the ideas outlined in Foucault's major works, (i.e. Madness and Civilization, Discipline and Punish, the Order of Things, Archeology of Knowledge, Birth of the Clinic, etc.). It is mostly a gathering of lectures and interviews with various scholars in the field of the history of systems of thought. The first essay (On Popular Justice) is a discussion with a Maoist organization about the applicability of people's courts and the use and relativity of the concept of justice. One gets the impression that Foucault is not entirely at home with this material. The second essay (Prison Talk) is an explication of the major ideas posited in Discipline and Punish, particularly the development of Bentham's Panopticon and the transmission of power as surveillance. A fascinating read, and one of Foucault's great breakthroughs in the social sciences. The third essay (Body/Power) provides further information about Discipline and Punish. The fourth essay (Questions of Geography) is very interesting as Foucualt is backed into a corner by the interviewer for failing to address questions of space in his analysis of power in the age or reason. It is fun to watch Foucault's thinking shift here throughout the course of the interview; initially he is quite hostile to the idea of examining geographical material as a means to access power relations, but he finishes with tremendous enthusiasm for the idea. The fifth essay (Two lectures) is a lecture course primarily concerned with Marxism and the social sciences more broadly. The sixth essay (Truth/Power) is another interview about power and the dissemination of knowledge and information and the dynamics of power as transmitted via discourse. The seventh essay (Power and Strategies) basically outlines the workings of power in totalitarian communist societies (esp. the USSR), and the usage of the gulags as a means of inducing docility and subordination. The eighth essay (The Eye of Power) is another explication of power as a mode of surveillance. The ninth essay (The Politics of Health in the 19th century) is not particularly interesting; in it, Foucault analyses the power relations implicit in public hospitals and medical treatment (further elaborated in Birth of the Clinic). The tenth essay is a very helpful summary of the major ideas posited in the History of Sexuality, an extraordinarily difficult and important text. Additionally, the eleventh essay (the Confession of the Flesh) provides further explication into the subsequent volumes of Foucault's massive history (which he sadly failed to complete).Naturally, any serious student of Foucault should turn to his original texts in order to fully grasp his philosophical outlook, yet this collection should serve as a useful conduit for new readers to his rich and complex body of work.

Balzac is often cited as the father of realism and I would have to agree, though I think Flaubert and Tolstoy took the form to new heights. This immensely rich novel begins with a devastating scene of psychological rape; M. Crevel has entered the home of the Baron Hulot and he has ransomed his wife for having stolen his former mistress. This novel exposes the hollowness of the post-revolution French bourgeoisie, as nearly all of the characters are despicably charlatans and libertines whose only interests are sex and money. This is a wonderfully entertaining read, it is impossible not to imagine the rich landscape that Balzac has so brilliantly created. However, his political diatribes are a bit pedantic and often detract from the otherwise perfect narrative. This novel is clearly a precursor to Proust, whose brilliance for detail would take the novel form to another plane altogether.

Foucault's continuation of his impressive History of Human Sexuality looks into the sexual mores and practices of the Ancient Greeks, and attempts to understand the development of sexuality as a moral problematic. Contrary to the conventional wisdom which posits a complete epistemic reversal from the Hellenic world to the Christian world, Foucault poses a more complex network of interconnections between the two paradigms, which lie in a valuation of asceticism. Although The Use of Pleasure is only a small piece of a very large story, it is an interesting development in the hermeneutics of sexuality.

I'm always pleased to pick up a book by Russell, his writing is always so brilliant and clear at the same time. This book, is a collection of essays on Christianity and Religion, and Russell provides logical and compelling arguments against the institution of faith, arguing that organized religion is grounded in hatred and fear and that its effects are harmful in the world. SOme of the essays are a little dry, and some of them are simply old news, but I would recommend this text to anyone interested in the topic. Russell is not confrontational or condescending, he simply argues his position with logic, history, and sometimes humor. The essay in which he equates Communism wiht Religion is particularly intriguing.

Foucault employs an exacting and yet artistic methodology of historical-sociological interpretation of the history of madness in the age of reason. In this impressive work, he discovers that the origin of insanity, of psychological confinement, corresponds with the diminution of leprosy in Europe, and that the sectors of institutional power sought to find another means of normalization and social control through the imprisonment, and public degradation of the mentally ill, the poor, and the homeless. This power dynamic later manifests itself in the form of absolute confinement and normalcy, in which the insane were subjected to physiological experimentation, which marks an apparent disregard for Descartes' mind-body distinction. Foucault skillfully outlines the means of psychological repair through the exploration of the balancing of the four humors, to the revealing of insanity's non-being and non-reason through its release to the ultimate freedom of nature. Foucault then examines the transition of psychology from the real of biological-intellectual non-reason, to the imposition of moral and religious absolutism and the birth of the asylum, and finally to the (perhaps salvation) of Freud and psychoanalysis, in which the patient-doctor relationship is recreated as a mode of observation, not judgment or condescension, "he made it the Mirror in which madness, in an almost motionless movement, clings to and casts off itself" (pg. 278). Foucault's Madness and Civilization represents an important breakthrough in the field of post-modern philosophy; it is truly an excellent work of scholarship and profound insight.-As a side note, this edition appears to be an incomplete version of Foucault's book, as it contains nothing on Descartes and his methodoligical relation between madness and doubt raised in the Meditations. This section would later be the focus of Derrida's criticism in his lecture 'Cogito and the History of Madness,' published in 'Writing and Difference,'which caused a rift between the two thinkers. The Vintage edition appears to be only one half of Foucault's original book. The complete version of the text is going to be published by Routledge later this year, so hold off on this one.

I generally prefer Sontag's longer and more personal essays usually found in her earlier work. This collection is a compilation of essays on art gathered from some of the last years of her life; they cover a wide range of topics, from literature to Italian photography. I felt that the most interesting section was her essays on her solidarity trips to Sarejevo during the Serbs' bombardment, where she directed a production of Beckett's Waiting for Godot; it's a wonderful testament to the universality of great art. I'm afraid I can't sustain the same kind of equality of interest to the arts collectively as Sontag did, and I must admit I found her pieces on garden art and dance terribly boring. That aside, she does include some characteristically excellent essays on film, such as her elaborate review of Fassbinder's adaptation of Alfred Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz which immediately imparted me with an urge to see the film and read the book. She also writes a brief review of cinema's 100 year history, which is a bit simplistic as any short piece on this topic would have to be. She maintains that silent cinema was born which brought forth two directions in cinema: art and entertainment. The films during the silent era were largely adaptations of plays and were truly great art. Then the sound period came into being and film receded into "Hollywood" adaptations of great novels which largely failed, until the pioneer directors of the period such as Howard Hawks perfected the genre style mode of filmmaking. Then the French New Wave came along, led by the genius of Jean-Luc Godard and Francoise Truffaut and turned movies into a high art for 20 years. Unfortunately, when production costs escalated in the 80's Hollywood took over gain and turned the cinema into an industry once again. This narrative has elements of truth, but it really denies the significance of many American and Asian filmmakers who played an important role in the history of film, Sontag prefers to label Godard the patron saint of the cinema, a view I hold only in his relationship with the progression of French cinema as a whole, a history which of course includes Jean Renoir, Sontag's essay does not acknowledge such masters.

James Wood takes up the question of the novel and faith in this excellent collection of essays. Perhaps more philosophical here than usual, Wood still demonstrates why he is the most insightful and eloquent commentator of fiction. His criticisms of Morrison, Pynchon, and Dellilo encapsulate what is so often wrong with contemporary American fiction. The American novel has unfortunately descended into a lumping amalgam of ostentatious allegories and social commentaries. Our most esteemed writers seem to have lost touch with the basic elements that make great fiction tick: character, description, mystery. On the other hand, Wood reserves kind words for truly fine novelists like Henry Green and Iris Murdoch; he also makes decidedly uncontroversial appraisals of Gogol, Hamsun, Melville, and Austin. He is more critical of Flaubert than usual, drawing out what he perceives to be some of the problems of realism in a great work like 'A Sentimental Education.' James Wood is always interesting and erudite. 'The Broken Estate' is an enormously accomplished collection of criticism.

This Platonic dialogue is one of the most intriguing and crisply enjoyable. It is here that Socrates relates his ideas on the complex intermingling of the beautiful and the good, as well as brilliant reflections on speech and writing. "Since it is the function of speech to lead souls by persuasion, he who is to be a rhetorician must know the various forms of soul." A privileging of speech over writing is preeminent in Western thought, perhaps it originates here. Writing is exterior to the soul, to the 'psyche,' thus it is mere mimesis. This is a wonderfully mysterious and complex text. Be sure to consult Fowler's translation in the loeb edition.

A very fine and intriguing documentary from Errol Morris about the life and work of physicist/celebrity Stephen Hawking, who revolutionized the way we think about the universe in his monumental book of the same name. The film is really divided into two stories, the life of Hawking as he struggles to overcome his paralysis, and the brilliant work he achieved in spite of his physical limitations. One gets the impression that had Hawking never became ill, he wouldn't have been as compelled to carry out the kind rigorous intellectual work that he of course did carry out, and (he himself notes that he was quite bored with life prior to his paralysis). Morris does a fine job with the material; the first half hour of the film suffers from a dry PBS feel, but the aesthetic and intellectual intensity takes off from there, the film never digresses into a mere sob story. Morris nearly always keeps the material more intellectually intriguing than it is uplifting and sentimental.

This text is a collection of lectures given by Noam Chomsky that relate to his insights into Linguistics, human knowledge, and politics to intellectual Bertrand Russell, whom Chomsky shared many points in common. The first half of the book provides a brilliant and succinct explication of his linguistic discoveries and its implications on human nature and general cognition, but it will surely be challenging to any reader not familiar with linguistics. The second half is an essay on Western Imperialism, particularly as it pertains to the Vietnam War, and for those who have read Chomsky's American Power and the New Mandarins this lecture comes off as a rehash of old material, although it does provide a devastating examination of the state-influenced intellectuals who control the political ideology or our insitutions, and of the threat of nuclear war and the extinction of the human species.

Leo Tolstoy's immortal novel about love and morality is an intricate, flawlessly conceived work of literary realism. Tolstoy's magnificent application of temporality imbues this epic with an almost unparalleled sense of verisimilitude. Using a dialectic between Anna and Vronsky, and Levin and Kitty, Tolstoy unfolds one of the most remarkable novels about human relationships in the canon. Anna is a beautiful but doomed woman, whose love affair with Count Vronsky sets her life into a chain of inevitable disasters. Tolstoy's blend of politics, social satire, and quiet meditations on country life in 19th century Russia mark this novel as one of the richest and most eternal of works of art. Tolstoy sought to use art as a vessel for his moral opinions about life, death, and Christianity, but fortunately his art triumphed over his message in this incomparable masterpiece.

This early Socratic dialogue casts Socrates and Euthyphro during the preparation for Socrates' trial. He has been accused of impiety and "innovating the gods" and is to face his accusers in the Apology. This dialogue revolves around a debate regarding the nature of piety and leads to an account of the forms. Socrates moves to a discussion of the `kath auto', that is, the thing in itself, which lies at the core of the Platonic logos. This is also an excellent dialogue for interrogating the nature of dialectic.

Yes of course Dostoevsky's The Gambler is a brilliant psychological account of the slippery slope into addiction. But it is also an extraordinarily balanced demonstration of the novella form. In this brief narrative, Dostoevsky weaves several competing characters within the fabric of aristocratic high-society. This is in many ways a strange book for him; there are less religious overtones for instance. It is also a clear prototype for the existentialist mania he would expand in Crime and Punishment. The point of view oscillations between the omniscient narrator and direct presentations of the action are indeed masterful. In many ways this is a more subtle and curious book than Notes for Underground, which lays bare all of its thematic dilemmas. There is a boiling underbelly in The Gambler which remains mysteriously unexposed. Garnette's translation is known to be overly Victorian, but the English is beautiful all the same.

If you want to see a Hollywood movie that manages to avoid an intelligible plot be sure to see this. David Cronenberg's comical horror-show about James Woods, a TV programmer of garbage who's life spins a little off kilter as he becomes implanted with a "videodrome," a kind of cartoonish tumor implanted by God-knows-what which then compels him to murder people.

A miraculously detailed work of history and philology--the myth of Isis is a source of endless interest for me, particularly as a reader of Apuleius. Witt's scholarship is resoundingly thorough here, as he surveys the deep syncretism of Isis and Osiris. From its obscure origins in Ancient Egypt to its bizarre and heterogeneous practices in Rome, the cult of Isis continues to plague scholars of German Romanticism, as well as early Greco-Roman literature. Witt's text remains among the best in the field.

This particular collection of Neruda's poetry is an astonishing aesthetic object. Neruda's verse is at once surrealistic and concrete. His explorations of the earth and the tragedies which envelop us resound with incomparable beauty and strength. Here we find a bold assemblage of erotic and tragic images-the surreal joins the ideal in a synthesis of boldly sublime poesy. Neruda's attunement to the feelings of the people is also miraculous; his poetic art is a universal art. An astonishing collection.

Positions is a collection of three interviews with the late Jacques Derrida, given after the major works (Writing and Difference, Grammatology) had already been released. This volume is a very helpful introduction to the major concepts Derrida developed-you will come to be acquainted with differance, logocentrism, and the archi-trace. Although this is not the best explication of deconstruction (as it has often been described), there is no doubt that Derrida's casual remarks on his work are elucidative and still creative. The interview with Kristeva is particularly interesting.

The text is pleasurable. The text is bliss. Barthes perforates the being of the text, he pinpoints the ineffability of the greatness of the truly great writers. He writes about Nietzsche, about Sade, about Flaubert, and many others. Unlike the general dynamic of French post-modernity and post-structuralism, Barthe's style and tone are unusually playful and entertaining. This treatise flows with the lucid readability of a good William Carlos Williams poem.Barthes relates reading to orgasm (petite mal=small death in Lacanian terms), reading is related to the act of striping, to seduction."The pleasure of the text is not the pleasure of the corporeal striptease or of narrative suspense" (pg. 10)."I am interested in language because it wounds or seduces me" (pg.38)And this text will seduce you too.

An incomparable text in the history of European letters. Rilke's letters to a young man who is contemplating military service, are a testament to the poetic spirit. Rilke's devotion to the life of solitary contemplation and writing is an ascetic principle in its full actualization. Through a life of naturalist ingestion and calm interiority, Rilke's poesy emerged at the forefront of all art. His insights into the nature of writing, of poetic creation, and literature are true miracles of subjective reflection. This text is a personal statement-a window into a poetic life devoted to nature, spirit, and the music of words. Truly an astonishing text.

Second part of Fritz Lang's bizarre epic about Indian mysticism shot for television and cut into two features by the studio (the other part being The Tiger of Eschnapur); it's a brilliantly executed pulpy and humorous masterpiece, with breathtaking color cinematography and elaborate set design which rivals the underworld city in Metropolis. Lang really celebrates the artifice of film, and his uncanny sense for mise-en scene proves his mastery of the craft. It's certainly a strange work and perhaps a bit hackneyed, but one should keep an open mind and sink in to the vivid images and spectacular naive tale of power and magic.

This extraordinary volume of the great Paul Celan marks his `turn,' in the final phase of his career, in which his work grew more abstracted, with more esoteric and wonderful neologisms and curiously primordial imagery.Pierre Joris has completed a fine translation from the German; the works remain highly creative and retain Celan's remarkable play with structure and phonemes. Look at the creativity:"Eye-lessscooped from you, eyes:the six-edged, denial, white,erratic.A blind man's hand, it also starhardFrom name-wandering,Rests on him, asLong as on you,Esther." (111).The tragic undertow of Celan's poetry will pull you in. Enjoy.

Hans Jurgen Sybeberg's 7 hour opus about Hitler came very highly recommended by Susan Sontag, who shed some light on the film's obscurity at the time of its American release.The film is however, in my (albeit preliminary) judgment, a fundamental abuse of the cinematic form. The filmmaker seeks to reconcile the tarnished history of his country (via releasing a 7 hour prolegomena on the particulars of Hitler's being, which Sybeberg conceives of as the distorted apotheosis of German Romanticism) with the sophistication and apparent brilliance of the heart of European civilization. However, the film is highly pedantic; passages proceed with monologues that recount the microscopic details of Hitler ad nauseum. There are endless discussions of Hitler's clothes, of the films and composers he loved, etc. etc. Not all of it is uninteresting, but this seems to me an exercise in absurdist-intellectual-Brechtianism, and an utter disregard (and lack of faith in), the cinematic form's narrative capacity to disclose truths about a given subject. Sybeberg's grand stage is baroque, creative, and yet at the same time economic, yet it is also clumsy and long-winded.I suspect that the intellectual community admires this work for the density of its text, and for the filmmaker's audacious, far-reaching sociological register. However, 7 hours of Sybeberg's pontifications fail to convey the philosophical/political horror that was the Holocaust that 30 minutes of Alain Resnais' `Night and Fog' was able to convey with mere photographs and documentary footage. This is an undeniable failing as a filmmaker in my judgment.Never the less, Sybeberg's film is undoubtedly rich, and everyone should see it. Perhaps I have merely misunderstood his lengthy piece, but I suspect that my initial reaction is correct. See it and judge for yourself.

Christina Stead's ambitious, regretfully overlooked novel is forged in the grand tradition of the great Southern Gothic stylists. It is the terribly tragic story of an overly-swollen family, doomed to impoverishment and misery. Sam Pollit, the patriarch of this hellish home, is the very figure of self-righteousness incarnate. He has surrounded himself with an army of unknowing followers--his children are the furniture of his unreasonable and inexplicable ego. There are pages of true vitriol between Sam and his wife--these sections ring true as painful renderings of a housewife turned slave. In large part, this is the story of a daughter trying to escape from her suffocating father. But the expanse of Stead's esoteric prose evokes the infinitely complex, infinitely terrible world of a kind of paternal evil that seems to have to now equal in contemporary literature. Perhaps too long, but this novel is still a tremendous accomplishment and a terribly strange and wonderful thing to live in.

I was pleased to hear upon completing this book that Nathaniel Mackey has more or less given himself over to writing poetry which I think is a smart move because his srange writing style (which places emphasis on sound) is far more suitable for poetry than prose. This novel, is the third installment of a trilogy about a traveling jazz band that is presented in letter form and has an off the wall weird mixture of music, myth, etymology, and surrealism. Unfortunately, for readers like me de-emphasis on story and character is always a serious handicap. It seems that Mackey is most interested with proving to his readers that he's an intellectual. Perhaps I just misunderstood this book, and maybe I would like it better if I read it again, but I just f ound it overly pretentious and ultimately unapproachable. There is a large following of literature buffs who swear it is masterful, but I can't imagine the average casual reader being anything but annoyed by this one.

Franz-Josef Murau is a wealthy intellectual living in Rome as a tutor of high German literature and philosophy. He has also abandoned his home in Austria-a country estate named Wolfsegg, until he is pulled back into the throes of the Austrian aristocracy when his parents and brother are killed in a car accident and the estate is bequeathed to him. What follows is a mordantly brilliant monologue excoriating the decadence of the Austrian rich in grand Bernhard style, which is to say ruthlessly and deliberately. This extraordinary novel represents the culmination of a signature voice, well-honed and developed over the course of a brilliant lifetime. In Extinction, Bernhard creates a world of militant philistinism with the thick residue of National Socialism, only to overturn and extinguish the world through the act of its recollection. The work is the work of extinction-the extinction of the bloody past, and the sense that its truth must be overdetermined in the interpretive mind. While I am less excited about Bernhard's explicit announcements about his program, this is still a very rich and nuanced aesthetic achievement.

Borges is naturally best known for his extraordinary short stories, but he regarded himself as a poet first. This volume shows you why. The poems collected here are a testament to his miraculous lyrical gifts; his poetry is at once creative, sad, beautiful, and euphoric. "Unknown Street," is one of the great achievements of romantic melancholia. There are also metaphysical inquisitions-Borges writes about Spinoza, Averroes, Aristotle, and Heraclitus. His was a mind devoted to the text. It was probably unclear as to where the books he devoured ended and real life began. There are also wonderful prologues in this volume which provide a chronicle of his creative process. In the final analysis, Borges' corpus is a singular event of literary and mystical affirmation. These poems continue to resonate today.

Primo Levi's final memoir about the Nazi Holocaust is among the most provocative and compelling accounts of the Shoah in the entire literature. Indeed, it is one of the great political memoirs of recent years. Levi was an Italian chemist, anti-Nazi activist, and Jew who was sent to Auschwitz and famously documented the atrocities that he experienced in `Survival at Auschwitz,' one of the first memoirs to be widely read in Germany. This book is a profoundly introspective rumination, not on the particular horrors of the camps, but of their philosophical implications for human beings as a whole. In `The Grey Zone,' Levi explores the moral ambiguity of this moment in history, both in terms of the work of the Kapos and the rare but meaningful resistance from the Germans. Levi is open to the possibility of a moral spectrum, yet he remains unequivocally vociferous in his condemnation of National Socialism, and of the German people's complicity with this movement. There are many striking and haunting moments in `The Drowned and the Saved,' such as Levi's discussion of the Musselman, or the experience of palpable shame on the part of the Jewish victims. This book is a special memoir because Levi refuses to draw the reader via an explicit recollection of the litany of horrors that he experienced, but because he is willing to penetrate into the meaning and truth of the holocaust as human abomination. A true masterpiece, both in approach and in execution.

Henry Miller's acclaimed `Tropic of Cancer' was a scandalously provocative novel when it was first published in France in 1934, though it has hardly maintained any of its initial shock value. However, that is not what is primarily disappointing about it; the novel also isn't very good, contrary to popular opinion. Miller sets out to portray a group of American expatriates in Paris and their various sexual exploits and feeble attempts to be artists. His writing is not very compelling, nor are his characters. At best, `Tropic' can be read as a kind of time capsule of the 1930's, when artistically oriented bohemians thought free love and sexual-backstabbing is cool. However, it certainly doesn't hold up to a number of far less ambitious books about the period, including Hemingway's `Moveable Feast,' or practically anything by Gertrude Stein. Through a new fusion of sex and artistry (not even coming close to the technical virtuosity of Joyce), Miller somehow found a niche for himself in the cannon of `great' literature. New readers of the book will probably be disappointed.

Fassbinder's complex blend of American gangsterism and Godard-like comedy coalesces magnificently in this early work. An American Soldier returns to Germany after the Vietnam as a contract killer-but this is not a simple indictment of American violence. The magnificent agglomeration of artistic and political accumulate here-in a way it is Fassbinder's most alive film. It is here that you at last are allowed to witness pure cinematic naturalism with the vitality of the German New Wave. An incomparable masterpiece on many levels.

A mordantly brilliant early Roman novel which is in fact, an update of Lucian's Transformations. Apuleius has infused this brief myth with a plethora of grotesque and imaginative anecdotes--The Cupid and Psyche myth have repeatedly been noted as the originary form of all "Beauty and the Beast" myths. We see here an incredibly modern, heterogeneous combination of violence, satire, and religious fervor all affixed to the metamorphosed peregrinations of an ass, injected with repeated themes of ancient barbarism and dolor. Book XI is an unprecedented rupture in narrative structure--the conversion ritual to the Goddess Isis, and then curiously, to Osiris, remains one of the richest testaments to that ancient cult in all of literature. Along with the Satyricon, The Golden Ass lies at the apex of Roman prose. Robert Graves' translation is highly colloquial.

This is one of Bukowski's more accomplished novels; it is more layered and truly felt than 'Post-Office,' yet at the same time is does not achieve the ugly splendor of his poetry.In this little book, Henry Chinaski is chasing women of all things, that is, while he's not chasing booze and notoriety. Having achieved a small amount of fame, he is now able to woo the ladies on command, and the result is extremely sexually graphic and candid.Many will find Buck's ramblings a tad repetitive (I did at least), though one cannot help feeling that these experiences are real. 'Women' is both funny and tragic; Buck is America's answer to the French Existentialists, albeit without the abstruse meanderings. This novel is a fine accomplishment, though not a classic.

It's difficult to point to a more complex and tragically beautiful American novel than Faulkner's 'The Sound and the Fury.' Composed with a kind of crazed inspiration, Faulkner traces the decline and ruin of the Compson family from the point of view of four of its members, the severely disabled Benjy, the self-destructive Quentin, and the resigned Jason. Dilsey, the African-American servant to the Compsons, remains one of the richest and most truly felt of all literary characters. This novel is extremely difficult in form; Faulkner's subtle use of first-person stream of consciousness narration and nonlinear chronology is both baffling and fascinating. Additionally, his removed 'appendix' after the completion of the narrative is as modern as anything that has been printed in the last thirty years. Presented as a tragic vision through a blurry bottle, 'The Sound and the Fury' will continue to haunt and perplex for as long as it is read and studied. A true masterpiece.

Euripedes is one of the greatest dramatists in the history of the west, and the Bacchae is one of his most powerful and violent tragedies. It is the tale of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and intoxication, and of his betrayal on earth by Pentheus, the disbeliever. Despite the apparent revenge play that unfolds, the content and meaning of the work is not as clear as it seems. As the chorus declares: "The gods have many shapes. The gods bring many things to their accomplishment. And what was most expected has not been accomplished. But god has found his way for what man expected." It is Dionysus that suffers in the form of Pentheus. Dinoysus is the god of suffering, of excrement and moisture. The Bacchae is a major work of tragedy, and it established a lasting cult of Dionysus in the west, all the way up to Nietzsche and the Birth of Tragedy.

Some have called this movie stupid, arrogant, pretentious, and brutal. Others swear by its greatness.Gaspar Noe has offered a film which tops his I Stand Alone in its sheer ability to manipulate and horrify the viewer. Like Memento (although far more engaging), the film unfolds in reverse chronological order, and interesting technique which transforms a would-be-average revenge fantasy into a provocative meditation on the destructive nature of time.The film begins with distracting camera movements and overwhelming violence as several men avenge the rape of a young woman (a 10 minute scene that drove many critics from the theater at Cannes), and then descends into the realm of these people in their normal lives.The second half of the film is undoubtedly superior to the first because it dares to draw the viewer in whereas the first half merely smacks you in the face.The young actress Monica Bellucci, who is the recipient of appalling violence, is particularly exceptional in the final act. This film is difficult to place and will clearly be the subject of much discussion in the years to come.

Imagine a story of dark horror, philosophical reflection, and enigmatic romance unfolding through the lens of clear blue water. That is what it was like, experiencing this novel for the first time. Kundera is able to burrow within the realm of Nietzschean, and sometimes Eastern Zen-like philosophy and at the same time explore the nature of language, and balance it with a highly nuanced, often meta-physical love story. Tomas is a successful man who has a wife but also loves another woman, Sabina. He is unable to decide whom to live with and his life descends into lightness, and ultimately meaninglessness. That is all I can say of the story. You must experience this fine novel for yourself, and be damn sure you read it before you see the movie!

Set in the hills of Piedmont, Pavese's fine novel casts his characters in a summer of existentialized rumination. A group of young friends spend their time idling in vacuous thought--until they meet Poli, a somewhat mysterious and rich figure who shares an open marriage with Gabriella and uses cocaine. As a result of the somewhat dated existential content of the dialogue, Pavese's novel fails to develop. Although there are many passages here and a dark, sonorous voice, the text has become rather stale.

A collection of essays on NATO's intervention in the Balkans during the 1990's, the volume includes work from a wide range of authors and covers a number of topics related to the conflict in that region. I will not refer to the essays by Giovanni Arrighi, Regis Debray, Harold Pinter, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Edward Said, Robert Redeker, Tariq Ali, Oskar Lefontaine, Noam Chomsky, John Gittings, Dieter S. Lutz, or Gazi Kaplan as their work provides zero citations (that's roughly of the total book mind you), I think that only the serious pieces are worth examining for obvious reasons.To begin, Peter Gowan's article is an examination of the underlying political dynamic between the U.S., the NATO powers, and the former Soviet Union prior to its collapse. The article is fairly speculative, its thesis is essentially that the U.S.'s interest in intervening in NATO were ultimately motivated by the post-cold war syndrome, namely that there was a fear of Russia's potential to dominate the region once it had collapsed. Unfortunately, the essay is dated and does not take into account Russia's economic decline during the post-cold war period, which rendered it incapable of competing with the U.S. and the great powers of Europe. Furthermore, Gowan makes a number of scholarly errors. For example, on page 5 he quotes the "Post" to the fact that "the Joint Chiefs went along with the campaign because of one key argument: `embracing the administration's view that U.S. leadership in NATO had to be preserved.'" However, he fails to provide a citation for this reference. He makes a claim on page 8 which makes little sense, stating that, "The political/diplomatic side of the Clinton administration, with Clinton's support, had been preparing a careful build up for a war against Yugoslavia for a full year. They wanted the war so that the US could pull its NATO allies under US leadership." And why is this? I thought the left was always adamant (correctly) that the US already had NATO under its leadership; plus the US simply does not need any further influence in NATO as it is far and away the most powerful state in the world. Gowan fails to explain this point. Furthermore, he includes a fancy chart on pages 38-39 to outline various "Programmes for Europe," buts it very amateurish. For example under "US Hegemony" and "Lead Powers" he writes, "The US as hegemony with Germany and France bandwaggoning." Interesting, I guess political scientists can get away with exacting terms like `bandwaggoning' these days. Gowan's article is generally dissatisfying, amateurish, irrelevant, and light on evidence.Gilbert Achar includes two articles which seek to examine the US's role in international affairs in relation to Europe as well, and it too is highly speculative. He makes a number of scholarly blunders which dampen his argument. For example, on page 58 he writes: "Negotiations were under way on the production of two hundred and fifty further aircraft under licence in China." And the citation he provides is "According to the strategic analysis agency STRATFOR in `Kosovo Conflict Accelerates Formation of Russia-China Strategic Alliance', 25 June 1999, published on the World Wide Web (www)." (pg. 92). I'm sorry, but if you must refer to a web page you really need to provide a specific URL. Another factual problem occurs on page 103, in which Achar provides a US defense spending chart at the top of the page, which provides information relevant to post-cold war US spending. However, the chart doesn't seem to be presented in constant 1997 US dollars, so his point that the spending was greater in 1995 than during much of the cold war cannot really be confirmed from the data given. Furthermore, his footnote to military spending figures on page 137 (footnote 18) says that, "The criteria for evaluating and comparing military spending in different countries are always open to doubt [...]" Well if they're open to doubt why does he cite them? Achar's data is mostly unreliable, and he ultimately fails to incorporate the specific political and economic issues of the Balkans into his thesis.The article by Alex Callinicos attempts to examine "The Ideology of Humanitarian Intervention" by pointing out the hypocrisy of NATO's proclamations of such intentions. The article is not particularly specific and tends to wander without providing conclusive evidence. He writes on page 175 that, "NATO's war against Serbia, by contrast, overrode Yugoslavia's territorial sovereignty on humanitarian grounds-namely securing the physical safety and political rights of the Kosovo of Albanians." This statement is false, NATO intervention didn't override Yugoslavia's sovereignty because Yugoslavia had no territorial sovereignty under international legal standards once the Titoist social system collapsed and the Serbs began to rage with violence against Muslims and Albanians, also invading their territory, which was stopped by NATO's intervention. Callinicos continues to cite totally irrelevant material such as Daniel Goldhagen on the matter of the "racist" attitudes against the Serbian population in the US intelligentsia. Such quibbling isn't necessary, nor is it relevant.The next article, by Ellen Meisksins Wood, is titled "Kosovo and the New Imperialism," and it is quite humorous because it fails to provide any real evidence that NATO's intentions were imperialistic. Wood continually makes over the top claims without providing any evidence, such as on page 191 where the text reads: "With all these larger objectives in mind, it is probably unnecessary to invoke oil supplies and pipelines-which are regularly, and often correctly, cited to explain US military adventures, including to some extent this last one." No evidence is provided for this last sentence. On NATO's intervention, Wood writes: "but if its sheer destructiveness, its damage to human beings (never mind its failure to save a single human life), is a funny way to achieve `humanitarian' objectives, it has certainly worked much better as one of those exemplary displays of the fist" (195). No evidence is provided, and furthermore the bombing did eventually prevent the loss of life by stopping the ethnic cleansing of the Albanians, and today Milosevic stands on trial for the war crimes the author knows he committed. An almost completely faulty article.The next article, titled "War: Building States from Nations," by Susan L. Woodward is about the context of the nationalistic/ethnic tensions among the people of the Balkans prior to Yugoslavia's dissolution, and it is far and away the best article in the book. She generally refers to excellent sources and does a very fine job of examining the history of these peoples. There are a few problems however. Her footnote for page 221 (#38) has no evidence contained within it, it simply states: "1.3 million Greeks left Asia Minor, and about 400,000 Turks left Greece. The division of India and Pakistan involved about 12 million Hindu and Muslim refugees" (pg. 261). There is no way to verify this claim. Additionally, footnotes #17 and 69 are not really valid, the latter simply reads: "There is some dispute about this event. I accept the version of a reliable informant who was present and knows there was no attack (interview with author). Not withstanding these scholarly blunders, Woodward's piece is generally serious and probably the most worthwhile read in the entire book, though it doesn't really fit with the book's overriding thesis of NATO imperialism in the Balkans.David Chandler's article titled "Bosnia: Prototype of a NATO Protectorate," is totally unreliable and almost always relies on spurious electronic sources. For example, footnotes # 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 23, and 33, are all electronic (pgs. 282-284). This simply isn't serious scholarship, most of them are from op-ed cites. Don't waste your time on this one.Moving along, Michel Chossudovsky's article titled "The Criminalization of Albania," seeks to examine the criminal/mafia ties of the Albanians for no known reason. The article is almost entirely irrelevant. Furthermore, many of his references are invalid, such as #63 "Interview by the author with an Albanian expert on the mining industry [...]," # 66 "Interview by author with an Albanian mining expert [...], (I wonder who these experts are), #76 "Interview by the author with the Chairman of VEFA Holding [...], (that one's a little better I guess). I'm afraid you can't just cite "interview with the author," more verifiable information is needed to be taken seriously. Once again, don't waste your time on this one.Finally, I come to Robin Blackburn's article "Kosovo: The War of NATO Expansion," another piece of spurious scholarship about the alleged imperialism in the Balkans. Blackburn writes on page 362: "Following a meeting of the G8 the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, made it clear no agreement had been reached on this issue because Russia could not accept the transformation of Kosovo into a NATO protectorate." Yet no evidence is provided to support Blackburn's claim about Ivanov's actions/statements. Furthermore, Blackburn makes outright factual errors at several times during the piece, such as on page 372 in which he writes: "And the relentless air assault actually strengthened Milosevic's control over his own population." This is just factually untrue, NATO's bombing forced the Serbs to surrender and Milosevic is now on trial in the International War Crimes Tribunal in Bosnia, which of course explains Blackburn's failure to provide a citation. Furthermore, his footnote #21 is also not valid, it says: "Brzenzinski's comment on 15 June 1999 on the CSIS website was [...]" (pg. 380) He has failed to provide a specific URL for this citation, thus the material cannot be accessed, probably because it isn't accurate.To conclude, Master's of the Universe is a terribly faulty book, riddled with poor scholarship and factual errors. I recommend Susan Woodward's piece for her scholarship and insight into the history of the Balkans, though she does not really discuss NATO or any `New Imperialism.' Diana Johnstone's piece is certainly not worth looking at as she is a complete joke as a journalist (see my review of her book "Fool's Crusade" for details), nor are any of the articles which fail to provide any legitimate evidence. The left is certainly right to be skeptical of NATO's proclamations of "Military Humanism," yet they must be willing to admit that there simply isn't enough substantial evidence to prove that NATO was motivated by "imperialism" either. Perhaps I will be proven wrong in the years to come.

Unlike the precision of research that his characteristic of Norman Finkelstein when it comes to the issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict, 'The Holocaust Industry' is a disorganized and ultimately spotty work of political science.Finkelstein's aim is to present an "anatomy and an indictment of the Holocaust industry," meaning the subsequent exploitation of the historical tragedy that was the Holocaust for political and financial ends. The book is composed of three basic sections, 'Capitalizing the Holocaust,' 'Hoaxers, Huxters, and History,' and 'The Double Shakedown.'Chapter one deals with the evolution of American awareness of the Holocaust as an event throughout the course of the post-war era. In it, Finkelstein alleges that the Holocaust was basically not discussed in America prior to the June 67 war in Israel. The majority of his arguments here are quite correct, though the general thrust of the argument is borrowed heavily from Peter Novick's book, 'The Holocaust in American Life,' which Finkelstein cites as a major influence but not a "radical critique" (5). In this section, Finkelstein oscillates between sharp political analysis and careless ranting. He includes bizarre footnotes to designate his 'terminology' such as footnote 7 on pg. 13, which states: "In this text, Jewish elites designates individuals prominent in the organizational and cultural life of the mainstream Jewish community." Unfortunately for Finkelstein, this is not really a proper "organization" which can be referred to on a whim. It are these kinds of generalizations which severely limit the quality and veracity of the arguments presented.Chapter 2 deals with the apparent influx of fraudulent "Holocaust literature" which has inundated the American public with pro-Israeli propaganda. Finkelstein discusses hoaxes like Wilkomirsky's "Fragments," and Kosinsky's "The Painted Bird," and rails on Elie Wiesel for charging for his lectures. While it is true that many individuals have turned a profit off of the Holocaust in this way (particularly in recent years), this argument remains entirely too reductive. What about the excellent and serious-minded work of Primo Levi, Ruth Kluger, and Paul Celan? Are these artists and historians trying to capitalize off of the Holocaust as well? At what point does an author become a Holocaust "Huxter"? The problem with this line of argumentation is that it lumps individuals into one enormous category that they may not necessarily deserve.The final chapter is the strongest of the book. Finkelstein ruthlessly scrutinizes the actions of the WJC in their claims against Swiss and German banks for Holocaust Survivors. He has documented a record of falsification that is difficult to believe. After winning the European monies (at an inflated sum), the relevant organizations subsequently refused to distribute the money to the actual Holocaust survivors. This is a difficult topic to stomach, and it raises many troubling questions. However, Finkelstein's evidence in these final sections is a valuable resource.The Holocaust Industry suffers from its polemicist ravings and broad generalizations. At the heart of it is an important issue, namely the issue form of historiography and memory regarding the Holocaust and other outrageous acts of genocide. Finkelstein is angry that the Holocaust has apparently been elevated above all human suffering, and he is angry that individuals have positioned themselves in such a way as to capitalize off of this horrible tragedy. Yet his work deteriorates in his tendency to rant and rave, as well as his frequent use of generalized and unsupported claims. Near the end of the book, Finkelstein writes that "The abnormality of the Nazi holocaust springs not from the event itself but from the exploitative industry that has grown up around it." (150). Are there no other instances of the exploitation of human tragedy? I am inclined to cite 9/11 and the U.S.S.R under Stalin as other examples of the same phenomenon.

Blessed with the gifts of an outstanding writer in his own right, this brief biography of Kafka from Max Brod spares you the tedious minutia that weigh down most literary biographies. What you are left with is a deeply personal and truly felt picture of a friend who sacrificed himself for his art. Kafka comes across here as a saintly martyr for literature and art-a suffering genius who found salvation and meaning in his work. Yet Brod is careful not to paint too dark of a picture; he is attuned to Kafka's tremendous humor and satirical wit. In short, he was a man sensitive to the pain and absurdity of the human condition, in all its beauty and pain. An outstanding portrait of this cutting edge artist who wrote for the crickets and is now secure in the literary pantheon.

On the Road is of course characterized as the bible of the beat generation, and certainly it is a perfect depiction of that particular time and place in American cultural history. But one must not be trapped by this characterization. On the Road is so much more. It is a beautiful journey with full and deeply imagined characters and feelings. Kerouac probably has more to say about American life in On the Road than any other novelist of the period. The book is a real joy and essential reading for anyone interested in breaking out of the mold of the plastic, suburban middle-America that came to dominate our landscape during the fiftees and beyond.

A deceptively simple text. Rousseau has distanced himself from the Social Contract and the concept of the noble savage here, and has decided to illustrate the principles of an education that will bring about `natural man.' Emile is his guinea pig, whom he allows to grow on his own accord. His governor and nurse impose nothing on him, and he is allowed to build and explore without any external authority, eventually choosing a vocation and place in society.For Rousseau, the most important property of modern society that is inimical to man is the exertion of authority and power over the subject. Emile is allowed to grow and flourish without the arbitrary directives of parent/authority figures. And as always, Rousseau's prose is light and wonderful. He falls short in the section on Emile's counter-part Sophie, who embodies practically all of the sexist facets of enlightenment prejudice, but this remains a very great work of political theory in spite of its shortcomings and frequent meanderings.

Hemingway's posthumous novel contains some fine writing reminiscent of the early short stories and novels. However, you can see why he failed to finish it; the book is also repetitive and much of the dialogue is embarrassingly artificial. This is a partially autobiographical work revolving around the relationship of an American writer and two women. They drink in Spain and hunt in Africa and they hunt and it will be good again like it was. The problems of Hemingways prose lie in his apparent dislike of the main female protagonist who is incessantly cryptic and needlessly demanding. There is more about Hemingway's own short comings as a husband than anything else here. Despite its critical attention I still regard this as a minor Hemingway work-a mere curiosity for readers of the great early prose.

Nietzsche's Die Froliche Wissenschaft may be a great and brilliant book precisely because it is impossible to say exactly what it is about. On the one hand, we are given the Nietzsche who repudiates the assumptions of Christian morality and German Nationalism, as well as the familiar Nietzsche who rejects dogmatism and rationalism, but we are also given an unusual Nietzsche who discusses the tremendous potential of the theoretical and physical sciences. There are also profound discussions on women in the Gay Science which break with his otherwise overt misogyny. Additionally, Nietzsche provides very lucid repudiations of all forms of nihilism (aphorisms which are often overlooked by contemporary commentators who wish to write Nietzsche off as a nihilistic thinker). Nietzsche also introduces a number of his most important philosophical ideas in the Gay Science, namely the notion of ressentiment, slave and master morality, 'God is Dead,' and the eternal recurrence of the same. This is a hugely important opus in the history of modernity, and it is an immensely pleasurable and satisfying read.

Salter's small collection of stories displays extraordinary skill as a minimalist stylist. Stories like "Dusk," "The Destruction of the Goetheanum," and "Cinema" are masterful displays of form and structure. Through the development of a sense of negative space Salter's stories isolate fragmentary, and often oblique particulars depicting a life. Dusk is a masterpiece of the tragic minimalism-its rhythmic development is truly a testament to Salter's considerable literary gifts.

Barthes elaborates on his thinking of semiology and utilizes the myth as an instantiation of the internal structure of sign. Although a number of the concrete popular examples such wine, wrestling, and toys ring a little flat-yet there is still a wealth of interesting material in this compact text. There is insightful work on the absence of proletarian myth, while myth is always interwoven on the right. Barthes argues that myth is what naturalizes contingent history, thus creating the illusion of necessity, particularly as it regards class relations. The myth is what fixates order in the service of bourgeois interests, a fixing of signs thus rendering them motionless and apparently immutable.

Carl Dreyer's 'Vampyr' is a testament to the way in which cinema has basically lost its' intangible capacity to cut across our our most banal expectations. This brief film is a tour-de-force of technical virtuosity-I particularly like the shots from inside the coffin. Of course, no one today is going to appreciate this little beauty for its horror-after all there's no 'camp' or shock value, merely the subtle accumulation of shadow and subtle eroticism. There are also truly revolutionary transgressions of point of view and continuity which render this masterpiece an eternally perplexing and interesting visual accomplishment.

A hugely enjoyable collection of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's comments about art, music, language, culture, Jewish life, religion in general, and a number of other topics. These writings were certainly never intended to be published, and one gets the slightly uncomfortable (though pleasurable) impression that Wittgenstein would not want them to be read. It's not in the same league as his more serious woks of philosophy, but it's an excellent way to understand his views on more earthly topics. The book is divided into dated quotes, and they're almost all interesting, and sometimes quite bizarre. I'll leave you with some of his insights:"Someone who knows too much finds it hard not to lie.""The problems of life are insoluble on the surface and can only be solved in depth. They are insoluble in surface dimensions.""Genius is what makes us forget the master's talent.""Genius is what makes us forget skill.""Language sets everyone the same traps; it is an immense network of easily accessible wrong turnings. And so we watch one man after another walking down the same paths and we know in advance where he will branch off, where walk straight on without noticing the side turning, etc. etc. What I have to do then is erect signposts at all the junctions where there are wrong turnings so as to help people past the danger points."

This is the way memoirs ought to be written. Nabokov takes the reader on a journey of the senses, of the dim and yet luminous memories of a childhood, through the eyes of a genius with an unprecedented attention for detail. Nabokov does not walk us through every relationship, every transition, etc. Rather, he gathers and recollects the memories of color, of feeling, and learning that are most important to him. There are remarkable passages in this text, including remarkably varied intellectual topics, i.e.: literature, politics, chess, mathematics, lepidoptery, ect. There is a passage on camoflauge and Nabokov's suspicion of Darwinian evolution that I love:"Natural selection, in the Darwinian sense, would not explain the miraculous coincidence of imitative aspect and imitative behavior, nor could one appeal to the theory of `the struggle for life' when a protective device was carried to a point of mimetic subtlety, exuberance, and luxury far in excess of a predator's power of appreciation. I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were a game of intricate enchantment and deception" (pg. 125).And so too is, `Speak Memory' a nonutilitarian delight. It is a magical work of enormous imaginative and evocative energy.

Jean-Luc Godard's follow-up to the ultra-Maoist Weekend, featuring Yves Montand as a former New Wave filmmaker and his wife Jane Fonda, as they become active in a factory takeover. The film is of course very sympathetic to Marxism and perhaps Leninism, but it's certainly toned down from the blood fest that is Weekend, perhaps regrettably. Godard insists on reinterpreting and imposing entirely new ideas about what a film can and ought to be, in this case an intellectualized espousal of the working class struggle. A few moments of daring misce-en-scene are worth mentioning; fist, Godard includes an awesome cutaway of the factory to reveal the power-dynamics of the uprising within, and an elaborate tracking sequence in a supermarket to reveal the gross stupidity of capitalist consumerism. Tout Va Bien is clearly a step-down from Godard's brilliant features of the 60's, but it's still provocative and worth any cinephile's time.

Self's satirical ersatz for The Planet of the Apes is a funny, raucous, and often brilliant book that compels us to face our own stupidity through the lenses of the apes. After a trendy London artist awakes one night to find himself transformed into an ape, his world is turned upside down with an endless litany of clinical observations and tests. Self embraces the absurdity of his subject with long depictions of ape copulation and arse-kissing. The long-winded peregrinations with Dr. Busner, as well as the repetitious structure wear this satire a bit thin in the end, though it never fails to entertain.

Elias Canetti's extraordinary, massive, memoirs are a tour de force of literary recollection. This is truly a total portrait of the development of an artist and intellectual. We are presented with early scenes of Canetti's difficult childhood with remarkable detail, which read just as well as the great novels of Mann, Broch, and Musil. The portrait of 1920's Vienna is where this text really shines-Canetti's association with the intellectual and artistic elite is a true pleasure. Through his deep friendship with such luminaries as Broch, Musil, Mann, and many many others, Canetti is slowly brought into his own as a brilliant novelist, playwright, thinker, polymath, etc. His main preoccupation concerns the nature of Crowds, and the modern struggle between the individual and the demands of society. Canetti's attunement to his political surroundings with the rise of Fascism and the horrors of the Second World War. Yet this great collection of memoirs is not restricted to the political or sociological-its scope is virtually limitless in Canetti's miraculous attempt to capture the life of the mind.

Phillip Roth's 1969 novel or perhaps it would be more accurate to say `tirade' actually holds up remarkably well after three decades. The novel is a prolonged rant to the narrator's analyst about growing up Jewish in New Jersey during the 1940's; it has all of the stereotypes one would expect; an overprotective/overbearing mother and father, alienation, humiliation, sexual frustration, the conflict between assimilation and modernity, and so on and so forth. The novel also has a nearly endless cascade of vulgar humor, often quite hilarious and smacking of reality. Roth has managed to concoct a brilliant pseudo-memoir; it's the literary Woody Allen dressed up with impressive verbiage and a razor-like ability to employ allusions. This is a slim work, but it is impossible not to devour. The jokes will leave you in tears and the narration is wonderfully composed. It is acerbic, real, and touching.

Gombrowicz was a fascinating writer, and the publication of his diaries in English are giving us a new perspective on his unique position within the history of 20th century European literature. Ferdydurke is probably his best loved work--through a brilliant, satirical sense of the fantastic, Gombrowicz creates a richly destabilizing world in which non-sense has been rendered as sense. Ferdydurke is the story of how, inexplicably, a writer finds himself transformed into an adolescent, but his consciousness remains mature (at least most of the time). We are thrown back into the world of youth--and it turns out to be a miserable, uncertain world where authority is illegitimate and desire is perpetually denied. Gombrowicz is perhaps most interesting in sustaining, and playing with formal contradictions--we witness the contradiction between mature and immature consciousnesses, as well as how they overlap and complicate each other. Although I think the book has lost some of its bite and no longer registers as experimental a work as it once did, Ferdydurke remains a brilliant and exciting work.

In 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide at the Franco-Spanish border fearing that he would be unable to escape the grasp of Hitler's regime. He left behind perhaps one of the finest collections of literary theory of his era, complete with lucidly brilliant essays on Kafka, Proust, Baudelaire, and general Marxist theory.In this wholly excellent collection of essays, a remarkable introduction to Benjamin's life and work is provided by the late philosopher Hannah Arendt, who overviews his political formations and literary output. It's a model form of critical essay writing.Perhaps the most famous essay in this collection is Benjamin's `The Task of the Translator,' widely regarded as one of the most important and thoughtful contributions to the field."No poem is intended for the reader, no picture for the beholder, no sympathy for the listener."He argues that translation is a mode, and that the translatability of the work is the primary concern in the process.Also included is an analysis of the philosophy of history.

Svevo's masterful prose is at once comic and tragic-this work is a brilliantly ironic confession, a work of perfect realism that teems with psychological energy. This is the story of a very petty man, a man in analysis-only he hates analysis. He tries to quit smoking incessantly only to keep quitting. He becomes a husband and then an adulterer. The novel traces his friendship/rivalry with Guido, the talented and lucky young man who marries the woman he loves. He develops a business partnership with Guido, but the latter's impetuous business ventures drive him to ruin. Svevo's prose is light in moments of tragedy-his gifts as a realist stylist were immense.

Winkler's brilliant and expansive text is a remarkable work of literary analysis. Given the vexing status of Book 11 of the transformations of Lucius, it is truly a great resource in contextualizing the narratological problems that permeate Apuleius' great novel. Winkler's reading is that The Golden Ass is largely about the question of interpretation itself--he is at great pains in surveying the vast array of scholarly accounts of Lucius' mysterious conversion to the cult of Isis, and he is a genuine expert of the topic indeed. I don't entirely accept his attempts to conflate The Golden Ass with the tropes of a modern mystery, and I still think there are deeper, more spiritually guided problems that structure the text than Winkler descries. A valuable and fascinating text all the same.

A truly great work of post-war realism. Yates' masterful novel is situated in the booming years of conformity in a squarely middle class suburb, where a young couple is struggling to preserve their inner vitality in a society that insists on mediocrity. Frank Wheeler is happily married to the beautiful and intelligent April-though it is a marriage strained by the exigencies of an unplanned birth. Frank works quietly and disinterestedly in sales until April proposes a radical move to Europe in order to save their freedom and talent. While Yates' preoccupation with the demands of modern American life are practically a clich&eacute; by now, Revolutionary Road never slides into the hackneyed or obvious. The crisp purity of Yate's prose-as well as his masterful sense of character, provide the support for this great little book as it moves into the depths of genuine tragedy.

Nietzsche's literary addendum to his philosophical oeuvre is, at its root, a radically modern autobiography. Written weeks before his collapse into paralysis, these are the final reflections of cogency from this great thinker; the sections are indeed self-inflated and passionate, with titles like `Why I am So Wise,' and `Why I am So Clever,' etc. However, Nietzsche is finally dubious about his reputation and whether or not he will ever be truly understood. He insists that his name "will be associated with the memory of something tremendous," and indeed it would. His work sought to expose the power structures of old societies and to expose the moral systems of Christianity. Nietzsche's tone is eerily prophetic as he insists that "there will be wars the like of which no one has ever seen," his stylish prose rings of a bold yet hysterical urgency. However, at the foundation of Nietzsche's thought is one of the great and subtle tensions in philosophy, the idea that his negating and destroying are "conditions of saying Yes." This is the difficulty of Nietzsche, who is all too easily categorized as the "Will to Power" philosopher of the modern period. We are still catching up to his profound insight, and this self-analysis should be a window into his genius and original intentions.

This is Jean-Paul Sartre's brief autobiography about the impact the printed word had on his life. The book is divided into two sections, the first is titled "Reading," and the second "Writing," and I think that's an excellent summary of his life. Sartre recounts his early childhood, being born into a family without a father, and ultimately living a secluded a childhood submerged in his grandfather's library. Sartre then discusses life at the Ecole Superior, when he began to develop as a writer of prodigious genius. Sartre doesn't discuss his work particularly; this text is not a critical examination of his literary and philosophical work. Rather, it is a deeply introspective reflection and inquiry into the powerful and lasting effects words can have in life. I recommend it to all fans of reading.

Samantha Power's 'A Problem from Hell' is a broad attempt to document the major acts of genocide/human rights violations of the 20th century paired with the international community's subsequent negligence in each case. She reports on the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, and especially her major areas of research- Rwanda and Serbia.However, Powers is content to simply recount major instances of crimes against humanity that the U.S. and other major Western powers simply ignored (a worthy historical task), rather than to document the major atrocities the U.S. supported/participated in (the far more morally serious and honest task). While she is scrupulous in her documentation of the horrors of Rwanda and Iraq, her sections on Indo-China fail miserably. She provides a lengthy and conventional chapter on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, without mentioning to inform us about the U.S.'s massive contribution to such atrocities (only side references are provided). Additionally, she mentions in a rather depraved manner, that "In 1975, when its ally, the oil-producing, anti-Communist Indonesia, invaded Timor, killing between 100,000 and 200,000 civilians, the United States looked away" (147). In actuality, the U.S. did not look away: it funded the genocide, and President Carter deliberately escalated the intensity of the atrocities. This is the essence of Power's political backwardness. Pointing to the atrocities of official enemies is easy, it is far more difficult and necessary to point to the atrocities of the U.S. and its allies. Nowhere does Powers discuss Israel and the Palestinians, nowhere does she discuss Pinochet, or the Contras, or Kissinger for that matter. So long as the the liberal intelligentsia refuses to stare in the mirror, the world will continue to be an arena of exploitation, injustice, and crimes against humanity.

De Quincey takes us towards a descent into an addiction of spirit and body in this incomparable work of autobiographical prose. In the great tradition of Augustine and Rousseau, De Quincey's confession is an elaborate unfolding of interiority itself. Beginning with his brilliant youth in classics and moving towards astonishing descriptions of his early poverty, this text is haunted with a sense of longing and despair. De Quincey's archaic prose is truly a miracle of architectural description; his command of hypotaxis is arguably without equal in the period. Do not miss this strange and wonderful text.

This extraordinary text totally paved the way for the rest of Western metaphysics. It is a lucid text, though still difficult because of the complexity of the ideas. In it, Aristotle posits his famous causes of being, material, formal, efficient, final. And he conceptualizes the criteria for essence. There is almost no way to master the contents of this body of work, it has challenged the greatest thinkers ever since its rediscovery and will continue to astound and mystify for as long as it continues to exist.This translation is fair, though the Hugh Tredennick is a bit clearer.

This collection of Pound is representative of his immensely bewitching gifts. It includes some of the best early poems and translations, including Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, as well as a number of the Cantos. Pound's poetry transformed the modern artistic climate and radicalized the Imagist movement. His creations are stunning articulations of the inner chronicle of all poetic achievement. His fine musicality and attention to linguistic texture is a true event in the history of poetry. This collection will serve to encapsulate the timeless beauty and mystery of his finest work.

Bellow's esteemed novella is a marvel of immanently crafted, modern realism. Situated within the course of a day, Bellow brings us into the life of Tommy Wilhelm, a middle-aged failure who is looked down upon by his father, his ex-wife, and just about everybody else. When he is propositioned with an opportunity by a true snake-oil-salesman to play in the stock market, Tommy's fortunes fall even farther into disrepair. Bellow's prose is beautifully ornamented with a textured sense of detail-and there is genuine pathos to be found here-but I can't help but feel unmoved by the self-conscious sense of the epiphanic structure Bellow imposes. A fine work nevertheless.

The stoic, bare prose of Raymond Carver's short fiction bears the stamp of a true craftsman, as well as an artist who knows the meaning of pain. These stories are a remarkable aesthetic accomplishment, one of the best collections of the period; they are both simple and intriguing in their cool and stark economy of form. Like Hemingway, Carver had the gift of creating a world through brief and beautiful glimpses. Never does he insert any clunky ideology or literary affectations. These stories are elegant, clean, and self-contained. They will also break your heart.

Sontag has once again compiled an intelligent collection of essays on widely varying aesthetic topics. Though she begins with a rather artificial and patronizing obituary for the late man of letters Paul Goodman, whose body of work she is evidently less than enthused with, though she feels obliged to compare him to Sartre. The essay rings of false piety.She moves into an expansive and favorable essay on Antonin Artaud, the great playwright and artist of the avant-garde movement. Sontag reviews the developments of his great career within the context of moralistic philosophic aesthetics, liking him with Nietzsche, then Sade, then Breton.Yet the most impressive essay in Under the Sign is titled `Fascinating Fascism,' and it is truly fascinating. In it, Sontag overviews the work of filmmaker, actress, and photographer Leni Riefenstahl, the Nazi propagandist whose body of work includes the esteemed documentaries Triumph of the Will, and Olympia, the latter about the 1936 Olympic games. Sontag reviews Riefenstahl's book of photography on the Nuba tribe in Sudan, which is apparently breathtaking. Sontag concludes that Reifenstahl, despite her `de-Nazification' and renunciation of her political past is still enamored with a fascist ideal, valuing the masculine strength of the male Nuba and placing their bodies in the foreground, while the women remain vulnerable and tucked away in shadowy corners. The essay is highly provocative.The title essay is about the great philosopher and literary critic Walter Benjamin, whom she reviews favorably. This essay provides some interesting tidbits of information that Hannah Arendt neglects to include in her introduction, such as Benjamin's apparent hatred for Heidegger's philosophy.Also included in this volume is an excellent and terse review of Roland Barthes, and the fine novelist Elias Canetti, whom she holds in great esteem.

To my mind the Meno is among the most mysterious of Plato's dialogues. Beginning with a discussion as to whether virtue can be taught, the interlocutors move into an inquiry into the nature of knowledge itself. Here we get a famous scene in which Plato demonstrates his theory of knowledge as recollection through an illustration in geometry. This is principally a work of epistemology, but it remains a strangely oblique portrait of eidetic truth.

This may be Sontag's most rigorous and important collection of essays, complete with topics ranging from Levi-Strauss to Godard. In it is her famous essay "On Camp," which would later make her a superstar in the New York artistic community.Sontag is worried about intellectual interpretation, the erudite and narrow approach to understanding a work of art. She calls on us to "show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means." Her approach is far reaching and yet acute and highly attuned to the intellectual aspects of the fine arts.This collection includes fabulous essays on Sartre, Bresson, Beckett, Lukacs, Resnais, and many others. It is evidence of her astonishing ability to think seriously and with tremendous beauty about that which is most important.

Feuerbach has too often been confined to the footnotes of the history of philosophy-a mere precursor to the more developed materialism of Marx and Engels. However, this little text is a tour de force of philosophical history and critique. Feuerbach attempts to undo the entire tradition of theology and speculative philosophy in less than 100 pages, and the force of his argument is uncomplicated and yet elegant. Feuerbach reveals the anthropocentric impulse inherent in theology and speculative philosophy, and suggests a radical philosophy of concrete reality as an alternative. Although Feuerbach's positive philosophy of sensation remains unclear and sketchy here, this remains an indispensable development in the history of materialism.

Musil's continuation of 'The Man Without Qualities' takes us even deeper into the turn of the century continental psyche. Ulrich and Agathe deliberate both the will and legacy of their late father as well as the nature of morality, human sexuality, and perhaps the unconscious. There are extraordinary additions to Musil's elaborate cathedral of ideas and characters, such as the brief visit to the asylum to meet Moosbrugger, the intriguing murderer and psychopath that haunts the imaginations of the elite within the Parallel Campaign. Although the Man Without Qualities is an incomplete work, it remains as rich as any major novel of the 20th century; if only Musil had been able to endow it with the structural strength and form to bring it to a close as his primary literary rivals (Joyce, Proust) had done so brilliantly.

This collection is an impressive gathering of interviews collected from the early sixties to the present. In it, the Professor gives some of his best long-range insights on a number of topics, such as linguistics, philosophy, science, politics, the Middle East, the media, and education. This volume is not the place to start if you are new to Chomsky's work, but it is an excellent supplement to his famous writings. As to the interviews themselves, they are mostly fascinating, Chomsky proves once again that he may be the most important intellectual of the latter half of the 20th century. My one complaint is that some of the interviews overlap, as he is asked to speak multiple times on a number of topics, he is asked what the conncection between his linguistic work and his political work is about twenty times for instance, as the title would suggest. Aside from that, this is an invaluable read.

Marxist historian Christopher Hill gives us a lucid and thoroughly researched account of the English civil war and the radical revolutionary movements that followed in the mid-seventeenth century. Born during this period of history was the Protestant ethic, the value of individualism in man's relation to God and society. We also witness many political movements calling for egalitarianism (prefiguring Marx and socialist theory) and several variants of libertarian socialism (albeit with Christianity thrown in the mix). This work of history captures the radical breakdown of the traditional family structure, the decentralization of discourse through the printing press, and the breakdown of England's long lasting monarchy. A must read for any student of revolution and political theory.

Bennett Miller's biopic about author Truman Capote and based on the Arthur Clarke biography of the same name. The film focuses on Capote's time spent researching the killing of a family in Kansas at the end of the 50's which would later be the subject of Capote's classic "non-fiction" novel In Cold Blood, which quickly rocketed the young writer to super-stardom. The film's structure is a bit perplexing; a film could easily be made from a number of segments in Capote's fascinating life and this version chooses to elaborate on the 10 years he spent on this particular work, which is essentially the middle of his life. This period certainly yields a lot of interesting material, yet I feel that those who have not read Clarke's biography may feel a little lost as there is very little context included. The most awesome facet of the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's incredible impersonation of Capote; he managed to capture all of the complexity and vulnerability of Capote's character, and the film is very interesting in revealing how the young writer's efforts on this project may have ultimately destroyed him.The film is very engaging and often disturbing. However, a few inaccuracies are worth mentioning. The film seems to depict Capote as being uncaring and disinterested in Dick, the less intelligent of the two killers, yet the biography makes it clear that Capote devoted a great deal of attention to both killers as they awaited execution, despite his clear affection for Perry. Also, the film indicates that In Cold Blood's reception was universal acclaim; quite the contrary, many mainstream reviewers and writers such as Norman Mailer denied the book's literary merits. And thirdly, the title card at the end of the film states that In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in America (which is disputable), and that he never finished another book, which is blatantly false. Capote published Music for Chameleons in 1980, a collection of short stories clearly conceived as a complete book. Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet.

Another shameful revisionist account from the left about the atrocities in the former Yugoslavia in which the author prefers to believe that NATO was acting in response to a desire to expand globalization instead of preventing an ethnic cleansing. Parenti's scholarship, as it is in several of his books, is very amateurish. He continually cites from totally ludicrous electronic sources such as the "World Socialist Website" to prove his claims, and rarely provides any serious evidence from the UN, or any reputable human rights organization.For example, Parenti continually includes text boxes to reveal scatterings of totally subjective writing without providing any evidence. On page 22 he includes a box that is titled "Not Cleansed Enough," in which he goes on to write that the U.S. simply had an urge to attack the region because of all the Communist and Soviet symbols displayed on the streets of Belgrade. He provides a very cute footnote for this bit of non-sense which says "10. Notes from my trip to Yugoslavia, August 1999. See also the article on my Yugoslavia sojourn on my Web site, www.Michaelparenti.org." (pg. 218). So are we supposed to believe what Parenti says because of the notes he took during a [...] vacation in Belgrade? Give me a break. Perhaps some more tangible evidence would be a help.Parenti makes so many ludicrous claims without providing any real evidence throughout the course of this book I was left totally breathless. For example, on page 52 he writes, "The Serbs issued warnings that Izetbegovic intended to turn Bosnia into an Islamic state, a charge that was dismissed as sheer fabrication by U.S. leaders and pundits." Literally zero evidence is provided to support this claim. Another instance of overtly specious citation occurs in Chapter 20, page 208 in which Parenti writes that, "[...] thousands of Serbian farming families in the Krajina region four years earlier-visited Montenegro to chide opposition politicians for their reluctance to plunge Yugoslavia into more civil war. Such a war would be brief, he assured them, and would `solve all your problems.'" His footnote for this one is impressive, which reads "Email correspondence to me, September 19, 1999" (pg. 237). Excellent research Parenti, email correspondence with whom, may I ask?Parenti barely manages to cite reputable sources or serious scholarly works about the conflict in Yugoslavia. The majority of his sources are either from (1) himself, (2) Socialist Websites, (3) his vacation, or (4) Diana Johnstone, pseudo-journalist and fraud (see my review of her book Fool's Paradise for details). Not very impressive or reliable. I suggest you look elsewhere if you're looking for answers about the situation in Bosnia.

I'm sure that most of you will simply look at the rating above and immediately pass a dismissive judgment on my political beliefs and choose to not read the review. However, it is true that all political reviews are born of a political predisposition, and I am honest to enough to admit that this review is from a leftist. It is important for leftists and followers of Chomsky to not dismiss this book out of hand, to go through the evidence and judge only after you evaluate the criticisms and the factual record. On the other hand, for those of you on the right who are comfortable with the findings in this book, I urge you to consider the following:Chapter 1 by Stephen Morris of Johns Hopkins University, called "Whitewashing Dictatorship in Communist Vietnam and Cambodia" of course attempts to make the case that Chomsky (and the far left in general), has apologized for the crimes of Communism during the United State's military involvement in Indochina during the 60's and 70's. However, I'm afraid Morris' scholarship is less than exemplary and makes incorrect assumptions about the nature of American involvement in Vietnam. Morris writes on the Communists, "the regime that controlled North Vietnam after 1954 was the political creation of the Vietnamese Communist Party [...] Its agenda was to seize total power, first by negotiation with the French, and from late 1946 on, by expelling the French from the region through armed force" (pg. 4). But what Morris presupposes here is that the Communists had no right to free themselves from French colonialism. He becomes confused on the next page while defining the ideology of the Vietnamese Communists, writing that, "North Vietnam was anything but democratic. It was a nation run by a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party," but then he also says, "the North Vietnamese, like their North Korean comrades, continued to revere Stalin publicly" (pg. 5). Unfortunately, both of these statements cannot be correct because Marxist-Leninism is inherently different than Stalinism, nor does he cite the relevant historical material to substantiate his claim. On Chomsky's apologetics for Maoist influence in North Vietnam, Morris writes that "Chomsky ignored the published eyewitness accounts of Vietnamese defectors and the well-documented scholarship of a Chinese-American academic historian" (pg. 6), yet Morris fails to name the historian. Morris makes the case that Chomsky was "not too perturbed by the Marxist-Leninist regime that controlled the population" (pg. 7), yet the quote from Chomsky that he himself provides expresses serious doubts about the social movement, "degree of centralization of control that, in the long run, will pose serious problems [...]" (pg. 8). Morris later provides an extract from Father Gelinas, a Jesuit priest who had taught in South Vietnam and argues that Chomsky distorts the meaning of Gelinas' testimony (pgs. 11-12), but no where does he indicate where Chomsky committed the misrepresentation. Similarly, Morris makes the case that Chomsky and Hermann disregarded the testimony of Nguyen Cong Hoan, quoting Chomsky, "How credible is his testimony in general?" Again, he fails to provide a citation for the quote. The rest of the essay, including his contemptuous section on Cambodia, proceeds with the same form of willful deception and miserly scholarship.Chapter 2, Chomsky and the Cold War, Thomas M. Nichols (U.S. Naval War College)Near the beginning of the essay, Nichols claims that Chomsky "will criticize the outcome of a revolution led by European Bolsheviks, but not those led by the likes of Castro" (pg. 38), which is simply not the case. Chomsky described Castro's regime as "tyrannical" (see Understanding Power, pg. 149). The majority of the first half the essay is an amateurish attempt to write of Chomsky as a Communist apologist without any serious referencing, nor does the author once mention the U.S.'s support for the Soviet Union during WWII, nor does he mention the U.S.'s support (rather incredibly) for the Khmer Rouge after the Cambodian genocide during the 1980's. Nichols moves on to a section titled Chomsky's "scholarship" in which he systematically distorts Chomsky's methodology. He makes the case on page 48 that Chomsky has misrepresented a study that appeared in Harvard professor William Yandell Elliot's book `The Political Economy of American Foreign Policy', which reveals that the U.S. was concerned about the Soviet Union to the extent that it would interfere with U.S. business interests. Nichols claims that Chomsky makes the case that the document was well known among U.S. planners, he writes: "This phrasing-especially the use of the word `document'-seems to indicate a widely read report", but unfortunately the word `document' in fact reveals absolutely nothing about how widely read it is. Furthermore, Chomsky himself (as quoted by Nichols), states that the document is "generally ignored." Nichols has contradicted himself in the course of a single paragraph. Additionally, Nichols makes the case that Chomsky will often make a claim in which he merely cites another of his books, which in turn, cites another of his books in such a way as to disguise the fact that Chomsky isn't referring to any actual evidence. Nichols writes: "in World Orders Old and New, his first note in his chapter on the Middle East reads: `For sources where not given here, see Deterring Democracy, chap. 1; Year 501, chap.2. An intrepid reader seeking to follow Chomsky's trail in his footnotes will find that very little of the first chapter in Chomsky's own Deterring Democracy is actually about the Middle East." While it is true that the Middle East occupies only a small portion of Chomsky's introductory chapter of the Cold War, the relevant factor is the evidence he cites. Turing to the footnotes of Deterring Democracy (pg. 68, n. 82), Chomsky cites Towards a New Cold War, but also Search for Security (Aaron David Miller), Aramco, the United States and Saudi Arabia (Irvine Anderson, Princeton U Press), Oil, War and American Security (Michael Stoff, Yale U), Oil and the American Century (David Painter, Johns Hopkins), and Eisenhower as cited in Steven Spiegel, The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict (University of Chicago). This is not exactly a slim sample of historical evidence. Furthermore, Nichols neglects to address the evidence presented by Chomsky in the footnotes to chapter 2 of Year 501 (pgs. 293-296), cited as the other reference for the relevant material in World Orders, wherein he cites a plethora of historical and scholarly material from obscure publications like the New York Times and American Foreign Policy (citing Kissinger directly). Even a superficial reading of his essay reveals that Nichols has not risen to the level of outright fabrication on the question of Chomsky's scholarly integrity.The Anti-Chomsky reader is nothing more than a collection of misrepresentations, factual inaccuracies, and consciously willed lies. The rest of the essays that follow are of the same intellectual-scholarly caliber as the ones previously discussed. I urge you to read through them and confront the evidence they present, I'm sure you will find that it collapses upon quick inspection.

Beyond Good and Evil is one of the most important works of modern philosophy, and I can't imagine I have anything to say about it that hasn't already been said. Nietzsche essentially argues that the majority of philosophy is simply the extension and logical extrapolation of an unfounded belief, or prejudice. Philosophical declarations of morality are typically baseless, and merely reflect the inner opinions of the philosopher. Well, there are more ideas in this book than I could possibly summarize. Read it and decide for yourself.

William Gass' first major literary accomplishment is a finely woven flight of mythic prose. Brackett Omensetter-a man with inexplicable luck-travels to an obscure town of Gilean on the Ohio River with his family where his existence faces off with Jethro Furber, a preacher with deeply evil tendencies. The majority of Omensetter's Luck is presented from Furber's point of view, and if there is something enduring in the work it is Gass' command of this disturbing voice. However, Gass' formalism also slips into strange flights of fancy-characters speak in elegant poesy, and the constancy of the stream of consciousness causes some serious murkiness. Nevertheless, this is a very beautiful book of real complexity and nuance. It continues to demand multiple readings.

Cormac McCarthy fuses Faulknerian dialog with the violence of Sade in this particularly gruesome and short novel. This novel's critical acclaim is probably nothing more than the combination of McCarthy's considerable technical skills and the shock value of the content. The 'protagonist' engages in violent rape, murder, and necrophilia in this repugnant piece of literary stylism. I could not put it down but I also could not help from thinking that it is ultimately a thin achievement.

This is one of the most important works of modern philosophy, I suggest you read it, but please do not pick up this translation which is absolutely riddled with out-right errors. For example, in Part I Definition 2 Spinoza rights: "The thing is called finite in its own kind which cannot be limited by another of the same nature." This is a total blunder, it should read as it does in the original: "The thing is called finite in its own kind which CAN be limited by another of the same nature." This error completely misunderstands the entire premise of Spinoza's entire argument! Please pick up another edition and enjoy.

Fabulously entertaining novel from Martin Amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `Information.' John Self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials. He is an alcoholic, a misogynist, and a microcosm of mainstream American culture in the 1980's. John has also landed a gig directing a feature film, titled `Good Money,' and `Bad Money,' depending on what day of the week it is. Amis' writing is mordantly brilliant; both acerbic and biting. There are transactions in here that I just love, such as John's stinging interactions with his girlfriend Selina:" `I've just gone off sex,' said Selina this morning, as she finished the tea I fondly brought her.`So?' I asked her.`God, be nice. Use your imagination. It'll pass. I've just gone off sex.'Then what do you think is the point of you? I wanted to say. But I didn't. I resisted the temptation. I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep.`Then what do you think is the point of you?'`You', she said, `are unreal' (226).You should read Amis for his remarkable power of description, his talent for black comedy and middle-aged disillusionment. Pay little heed to his flights into post-modernity, they are merely exercises in literary chic.

A richly absurd masterwork of existential theater. Although this is only existentialist from a certain perspective. As Adorno has argued, Beckett was preoccupied with a confrontation with existentialist ontology-this work is the negation of existentialist thought via `subtraction,' which is to say that Beckett subtracts from the raw materials of ontology and presents their non-sense as sense. After an implicit event of annihilation, the characters of his tragedy play out the impossibility of any reconciliation with meaning. Beckett lives in the world of non-sense, and for many, this play is incomprehensible. And it should not be interpreted. It is simply the presentation of man's reconciliation with absolute alienation.

Allan Bloom, the late translator of Plato's Republic and professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, has assembled a partially cranky, but never the less insightful critical examination of the American University system in the post-60's era. His assessment predictably reeks of the stuffy conservatism of his mentor Leo Strauss, but that should not deter one from confronting his arguments. The American university, in his perception, is inundated with transitory cultural and political problems; the academy (in Plato's conception), must continually strive towards the good, it must teach what is eternal and beautiful and drop the multi-culturalism and relativism of the postmodern era. Bloom is distraught about the preponderance of German philosophy in the academy, a Nietzschean rejection of morality and a Heideggerian rejection of the impact of the individual. Bloom's knowledge of history and philosophy is fair, and his arguments are not totally grounded in neo-conservatism (he rejects the legitimacy of the MBA), yet at the same time his book often comes across as an old man's rant. He does not value the creativity and individuality of the student intellect, and he may ultimately just be afraid of the black panthers. On the contrary, I suspect that his concerns may be more relevant today as the popularity of the liberal arts degree has lessened, and superficial non-fields such as feminism and multi-culturalism appear to have grounded their place in the academy for good.

A fine, though underwhelming collection of analytic papers on Aristotle's Metaphysics, with widely varying results. Charlotte Witt's work on actuality really shines in this volume, proving once again her place among the leading Aristotle commentators. There are also serious misfires; in particular, Michael Frede's assessment of act and potency is problematic from start to finish, despite the interesting questions raised. All together, a fair picture of where contemporary Aristotle scholarship in Anglo-American philosophy stands.

George Steiner's brief intro is surly competent and his investigation of Heidegger's use of the German language is particularly well informed. Steiner is commenting on Heidegger's corpus more as a cultural commentator rather than a philosopher, but he still gets most of the fundamentals correct. While often labeled as a work of populism, I found this monograph to be a fruitful study-Steiner shines in situating Heidegger in the greater context of German cultural life. It's also interesting to see the ways in which this text is hopelessly dated. Steiner mentions that the Gesamtausgabe will be over 60 volumes, today it's over 100. Nevertheless, this is not a bad introduction to the work of Heidegger, and it also provides some useful commentary on his infamous political behavior.

David Krell and Donald Bates trace the major sites of Nietzsche's productive period, tracing the French and Italian Riviera, Sils Maria, Turin, and the mountains of the Engadine in an attempt to examine the role of space in the creative work of this great philosopher. The book also serves the role of a miniature biography, the authors have done a great deal of research in the primary literature, reproducing a number of letters between friends, family, and colleagues. The book does not attempt to pinpoint the exact influence of landscape on the content of Nietzsche's work per se, still one does get the impression that the atmosphere of these places contributed to the dramatic flare of Nietzsche's style. The photographs are truly beautiful, but one still feels unsatisfied by the lack of analysis of the actual philosophy itself.

Christopher Hitchens places himself as a radical political contraire, desperately seeking to impart his wisdom to youthful students of foreign affairs; he gives answers to unasked questions and revels in his own glorious self. I like Hitchens and think he was once one of the great journalists in the world, but lately his egoism and opportunism have gotten a little hard to take. Listen, to brashly and stupidly apologize for the crimes of George W. Bush when you were once a self-proclaimed Trotskyite is not being "independent-minded," it's selling out. Notice how polemicists who change their worldview always seem to migrate towards the center of power, never the other way around. This is a rather useless little book in which Hitchens is constantly making love and equating his style to George Orwell which is just pitiful, Orwell never had to directly impart his virtue to others in letter form, it was always right there in his novels and essays, and that is what Hitchens cant seem to understand, a true journalistic dissident does not have to expound his views, they're right there on the page, let the readers think for themselves. I'd like to see Hitchens return to the valuable work he has done in the past and stop trying to make a cheap buck off this schlock.

Excellent and brilliantly witty and dry series of lecture courses on literature from the master, Vladimir Nabokov. In this volume, Nabokov fights against all interpretive lenses, he denounces the sociological, political, and autobiographical perspectives on literature, arguing that a true reader should pay attention to the detail of the author's narrative, to the artistry and creativity, and not get drawn into banal generalizations. He writes that "the novels in this series are supreme fairy tales" (pg. 2).According to Nabokov, good reader should:1. Have an imagination2. Have a memory3. Have a dictionary4. Have some artistic senseIn this volume, Nabokov lectures on a wide variety of great literature, including Jane Austin's `Mansfield Park,' Charles Dickens' `Bleak House,' `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (an unusual choice at the time), `Madame Bovary' by Flaubert, Proust's great `a la recherch&eacute;,' `the Metamorphosis,' by Kafka, `Ulysses,' by Joyce, and an excellent essay called `The Art of Literature and Commensense.'This volume is filled with pleasurable surprises, especially the marvelous facsimiles of Nabokov's lecture preparations with complete annotations, and many wonderful diagrams and illustrations of the works analyzed. He has some great drawings of Gregor Samsa the beetle, and the floor-map of his apartment. It really helps the reader appreciate the work unlike the bulk of literary criticism, which seeks to mystify and empower the interpreter. This is a true appreciation of the novel form, and a classic of lit criticism from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. His depth and breadth of understanding and attention to detail will astound you.

An incomparable work. Thomas Bernnhard's fluid meditation on genius, obsession, and suicide is characteristic of his monomaniacal style. In Correction, the great scientist Roithamer has left behind a voluminous collection of letters and plans for the construction of his "cone," designed to honor his sister. In the first book, an unnamed narrator attempts to sift through the disarray that Roithamer left behind, while in the second book the narrative voice shifts to the tragic hero himself. This is a remarkable novel about the loneliness and alienation of the intellect as well as a significant meditation on the desire for perfection. Often regarded as Bernhard's greatest novel, it will undoubtedly be read in future years for its extraordinary combination of elements.

Camus' The Fall continues the existentialist strain in this powerful artist. It is the story of a `just' man devoted to altruist acts of goodness. The novel proceeds as a monological confession in an Amsterdam bar-our narrator discusses his justice, and slowly reveals the ironical underbelly of his virtuous veneer. This is the story of descent, of damnation, and the consequences of freedom. An extremely beautiful and thoughtful text.

It's truly a joy and a privilege to hear this cutting edge artist, who has proven himself pretty clearly to be one of the best musicians of the last 30 years back on top of his game after falling into chronic fatigue syndrome. This album, which is a recording of a live solo performance, is deeply moving and introspective. I'm glad they decided to leave Keith's humming in the recording at the last minute. What is evident from his playing here is that he is a true artist, who is constantly devoted to sharing his most private feelings and challenging our ears. He seems fully energized here, though he has sections of amelodic and very dark and perhaps even slightly aggressive movements. Highly varied and beautiful. The conclusion is among the most intense bits I've ever heard. To any fan of music, do not miss this record!

Borges was first a poet, then a masterful creator of the short story, but through the entirety of his illustrious career he was also a brilliant essayist. This collection is an absolute farrago of insight and erudition. This was a man who read literally everything-he was obsessed with traditional adventure and mystery, the fantastical, the surreal. He read metaphysics thoroughly and passionately-there are brilliant commentaries on Nietzsche's eternal return of the same here, as well as the concept of time in Bergson. He was a reader of astrology, of politics, of poetry. It is an absolute pleasure to see him discover the likes of James Joyce in his reviews, as well as the jaw-dropping list of essential books. Borges lived in his own infinite library, and this volume is a testament to how rich the endless volumes circling in his head really were.

Beckett's so called trilogy of brief novels is a true masterwork of stream of consciousness prose. Beckett has pushed the boundaries of the novel in this great collection, beginning with Molloy (perhaps his finest work), which recounts the narrative of a man decaying either in an asylum or in jail. The detective who is employed to find him has an increasingly similar experience to the narrator's in this bizarre meditation on the horrifically uncanny aspects of modernity. Beckett has stripped the novel of plot and intelligible characters; we are left with dark landscapes and interior thoughts which are both poetic and tragically moving. The unnameable is the least formally conventional of the three, as the borders of the narrator are blurred with the totality of Beckett's fictional universe. This work is dark and filthy like the best of modern prose. It is a Joycean tract of the unconscious mind. Beckett is also particularly admirable here for translating his own French prose into English. A truly cutting edge artist and visionary writer.

Marcel Mauss' seminal work of ethnography reviews the practice of the 'potlatch' in a number of archaic societies throughout the world. His analysis and empirical data are far reaching and highly specific, drawing on a number of the finest researchers in the field (such as Malinowski). Mauss' observations present a picture of a highly complex system of reciprocity, a social contract so important and complex that it often results in competition and often warfare between cross-existing tribes. The ideas in this book are so easily accepted and integrated into our understanding of reciprocity by now that today they seem almost unoriginal. Although Mauss' conclusion that individuals ought to be expected to work, and that absolute reciprocity or 'communism' is dangerous are problematic views, 'The Gift' remains a cornerstone in the field.

Spinoza's Ethics is perhaps the first major response to the radical Cartesianism of his period. Although published posthumously (and considered a curiosity by many of Spinoza's closest friends), the Ethics quickly became the center of metaphysical and epistemological attention in Europe. Drawing from a constellation of axioms, Spinoza constructs an elaborate geometrical castle of metaphysical thinking. This beautiful work of inquiry effectively overturns much of Cartesian conceptions of causality and has effectively been canonized as the essential alternative to Kantian epistemology. Spinoza's thinking of substance, attributes, and modes, has remained an indispensable source of joy and bliss for major philosophers. This enticing and difficult text remains a major source of philosophical writing and debate. Curley's translation is still the best in English.

David Krell's avant-garde biography of the great philosopher is borderline incomprehensible as it is steeped in an impenetrable post-modern litany of obscurantist literary techniques. However, the novel is truly ambitious, as Krell attempts to tell the Nietzsche's story from the point of view of his late insanity. The result is extraordinarily unreadable and esoteric. Perhaps the one notable achievement of the work is that Krell has reproduced many of Nietzsche's original letters to friends and family and all of his medical documents recorded during his years in mental institutions. The reader is provided with a rich insight into the poor man's regression. Still, one is left with a broken storyline, undeveloped characters and scenarios, and prose that is entirely too derivative of Joyce's Ulysses.

Another extraordinary comic achievement from the great Wodehouse, this time written in the post-war period. Jeeves and Bertie are stuck in Totleigh Towers again and Spode is on to them. This little gem includes many of Wodehouse's best characters-the Bassetts, Gussie, and of course Stiffy. The prose shines with the same creativity and playfulness as always. Classic Wodehouse.

Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.

The Earrings of Madame de... is virtually a miracle of cinematic balance. The film gracefully moves along its comedic gestures towards a critique of aristocratic life. But like the best of Renoir-Ophuls refuses to reduce his work to a dry analysis of classes. Madame escalates into a divinely written tragedy with moments of transcendentally inspired dialogue. This is an indispensable gem of the cinema, though it will undoubtedly remain overly saturated with sentiment for today's audiences.

Burger's concise text on the theory of the avant-garde is a particularly lucid and well argued explication of the meaning and lasting significance of the avant-garde as movement, and it manages to develop a position in relation to the history of art in a very few strokes. Burger interrogates the rise of modernism and the increasing "autonomy" of the arts in the bourgeois era, and argues that the avant-garde was a critical response to art as an institution and its strictures. While the avant-garde was largely constituted by a false sublation of the autonomy thesis, it was successful in exposing the elements of artistic production that make up the art world as an institution. While the text is not without its problems, it is an excellent work of aesthetic theory, and among the best historical assessments of the avant-garde we have.

Christopher Hitchens synthesizes his daunting knowledge of politics with his love of fine literature and letters in Unacknowledged Legislation, arguably his best collection of essays to date. Hitchens seeks to bridge the gap between art and politics through a critical review of the major English-speaking author's political views in the 20th century. Perhaps this critical effort could be construed as showboating as Hitchens' profession is political journalism, and this is one of his few collections which fits squarely into the literary criticism section. However, Hitchens is a fine writer and he knows his literature as well as anybody still living.In this collection, we get a wonderful set of essays about Oscar Wilde and his contribution to the art of play-writing and support for socialism followed by his horrendous victimization as a homosexual. There's a passage from this section that I cannot resist quoting, "Wilde was able to be mordant and witty because he was, deep down and on the surface, un home serieux. May his memory stay carnation-green. May he ever encourage us to think that the bores and the bullies and the literal minds need not always win. May he induce us to rise from our semi-recumbent postures" (pg. 9).Hitchens proceeds to run through nearly all of the crucial English writers of our era. He of course writes about Orwell, which I thought was a mute point after his Why Orwell Matters, but hey, the guy loves his Orwell. He discusses the anti-Semitism and fascism in T.S. Eliot, the racism of Rudyard Kipling, the historical depth of Gore Vidal, the heavy-handedness of Norman Podhoretz, Allan Bloom's influence on Saul Bellow, and of course, his solidarity with Salman Rushdie upon the declaration of the fatwa among Islamic Jihads, an action for which Hitchens rightfully boasts.Hitchens also provides critical summaries of the arch-sensationalist Tom Wolf, and hack, Tom Clancy. He offers simply biting criticism of the former, and much needed as Wolf as enjoyed ludicrous financial and critical success for his quasi-journalism over the last few decades. Hitch examines Wolf's reliance on the clich&eacute;, and the cultural and racial stereotype for the sake of provocation. Clancy, while less deserving of a critical review than Wolf, is quickly wrapped up in a body bag and tossed overboard by Hitch.Unacknowledged Legislation may be Hitchens' finest blend of the political and the literary, and it may be the best example of his prolific gifts. Don't miss this volume.

Joseph Roth's `The Emperor's Tomb' is a curious work of nostalgia about the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the reconstruction of modern Austria through the eyes of a single individual. Unfortunately, one gets the impression that Roth's prose never really gets through in translation as the English remains are often clunky and awkward. Additionally, the novel is filled with unremarkable scenes of peasant life which fail to capture any of the idealism that Roth was apparently striving for. We are left with dull flat characters and dull flat scenarios, often with clumsy marks of emphasis and detail. This may be the result of the fact that `Emperor's Tomb' is essentially a transitional work in Roth's epic quasi-trilogy. Nevertheless, a tremendously overrated novel.

"I drove north up the Harbor freeway toward Hollywood Park. I'd been playing the horses over 30 years. It started after my near fatal hemorrhage at the L.A. County Hospital. They told me that if I took another drink that I was dead.`What'll I do?' I asked Jane.`About What?'`What'll I use as a substitute for drink?'`Well, there are the horses.'`Horses? What do you do?'`Bet on them? Sounds stupid.'We went and I won handsomely. I began to go on a daily basis. Then, slowly, I began to drink a little again. Then I drank more. And I didn't die. So then I had drinking and the horses. I was hooked all around" (176).Bukowksi's prose, much like his persona is strong, dead-pan, and often touching and funny. This novel however, is weaker than much of his other works of fiction because the narrator, Henry Chianski, is constantly surrounded by his colleagues. Bukowski doesn't allow for any breathing room in this often redundant portraiture of the world of making film, a field Bukowski has nothing but contempt for. After 100 pages of endless negotiations and back-stabbings one wonders why Bukowski wasn't able to conjure any better scenarios than he was in `The Post-Office,' a far less interesting subject and setting. This novel is not without its moments and the prose is never embarrassing, but it removes the grit and loneliness of his earlier work, necessarily at that, as he composes it onto the screen. A minor effort from an otherwise effective and provocative author.

Althusser's reading of Capital is a theoretical exegesis of the act of reading a body of work itself. Althusser deals with the complexity of the Marxian project with all the tools of the structuralist tool-box, arguing in favor of a synchronic analysis of the array of concepts. Additionally, Althusser makes significant epistemological contributions to the our understanding of the fetishism of the commodity; he argues that there is an epistemological block inherent to capital, that the system by its nature obscures itself. However, Althusser establishes his own epistemology which identifies two worlds-the object and the object of knowledge-which he is never able to adequately resolve. Still, this remains a crucial text in the reception of Marx's philosophical status.

Thomas Mann's opus follows Hans Castorp's visit to a tuberculosis sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a stay which would last seven years. This immensely rich and complex novel is, at its core, about temporality. We are given numerous conversations between the primary actors about the plasticity of time, about the ways in which our sense of time shape our existence. What is particularly brilliant about Mann's prose in 'The Magic Mountain,' is his ability to provoke sensations in the reader that mirror the protagonist. For instance, during the scene early in the novel where Castorp decides to stay at the sanatorium, I found that I too had been seduced by the private world which Castorp had become embedded. It is during this scene that it is revealed that the patients are in fact intoxicated (both literally and metaphorically) by their environment; the accretion of bacteria on the spinal cord creates the effect of a subtle intoxication and euphoria. Remarkably, Mann does not fail to create this effect through the creation of his conversations, which achieve an extraordinary level of verisimilitude. This is a novel about ideas, not actions. We are thrown into an ongoing dialectic between the enlightenment and romanticism, between the hard sciences and psychoanalysis, between philosophy and religion, and so on. The characters, particularly Castorp, Settembrini, and Dr. Krokowski, pulse with realistic energy. 'The Magic Mountain' is a masterpiece of form and scale, it is truly one of the great literary works of its time. John Woods has provided a supremely readable translation, both in the beauty of its cadences and in the rich subtlety of the dialog.

Jazz is an interesting novel, and in some ways the characters ring truer than in her most acclaimed work, Beloved. The story unfolds in a totally brilliant way, we see the key event in the narrative from multiple points of view, and the character's perspective from many points in time. The narration is also deliberately self-conscious and at times humorous, though I was annoyed by her stream of consciousness at the book's end. Still, Morrison does an excellent job weaving character, moral ambiguity, violence, race, and sociology in a vivid mosaic of Harlem life.

Merleau-Ponty's other unfinished book is a remarkable work of phenomenology, with significant development's in this great thinker's work. This is an amazingly complex investigation into the nature of language itself-Merleau-Ponty juxtaposes the language of the sciences, i.e. "the algorithm," with "the language of literature," while he privileges the latter. There are significant aesthetic contributions to literary theory in this text-with astonishing passages on the nature of reading and the transmission of signs. Strangely enough, Merleau-Ponty is quite close to Saussure and the structuralist tradition at many points in this text-despite his explicit criticisms of structuralism in Signs. While this text is unfinished and uneven, there are still exceptional passages on language-as great as anything in Phenomenology of Perception.

The Confusions of Young Torless is a novel about a young and thoughtful boy who is thrown into the world of a private military school where violence and sexual aggression are the norm. He becomes acquainted with a local prostitute through his school friends and engages in intercourse with her despite his apparent homosexuality. The novel is filled with sexual confusion (hence the title), and sadism. Musil has constructed an awkwardly Nietzschean exploration of human morality, gender roles, and power through the eyes of a young genius. However, the novel's conclusion is an entirely unconvincing lecture about the arbitrariness of human/social morality delivered by Torless towards his mentors. It rings of cheap peachiness and the inability to construct a literary narrative. Musil was quite young when he wrote this novel, and it does not compare to his great `Man Without Qualities.' However, there are moments of beautiful prose here, particularly the interior narration of Torless, which is filled with thoughtful subtlety and the foundation of a truly remarkable artist.

David Rothman's history of the American asylum is among the best historical accounts of all of America's major institutions of confinement. Rothman uses the model of the asylum-as it was conceived and developed by Kirkbride, as a model for confinement in the 19th century in general. By tracing the elaborate histories of asylums, penitentiaries, almshouses, and reformatories, Rothman paints a critical picture of American psychiatry. An indispensable resource for anyone interested institutional genealogy of our major institutions of confinement.

A supremely enjoyable and intelligent collection of essays by the novelist, philosopher, and man of letters, William Gass. `Finding a Form' proceeds as its sounds-it is a journey through the aesthetic imagination and complex itinerary that is the mind of the author. I particularly enjoyed the essays on Ford, Pound and the Book, but there is more on literature in this text than in most college English courses. Gass has the gift of delivering us creative brilliance with clarity-he hates obscurantism but blithely critiques some of Nietzsche's most astonishing commentators. There are plenty of old fashioned philosophical questions in here as well, the divide between aesthetics and ethics, the role of truth in fiction, the nature of knowledge and poetic creation, etc. Yet there is no denying the work that has gone into Gass' formidable intellect. He has indeed read everything and this collection is a testament to his remarkable commitment to the text.

British novelist Martin Amis ponders the question, `why is it that one never laughs about Hitler's Holocaust which claimed the lives of 11 million, while members of the left are able to laugh about Stalin's rule, which claimed the lives of over 20 million?' This is an examination of the socio-historical-political facets that underlie Soviet style communism, and seeks to provide explanation for its broad support among the European intellectual elite of the 1950's, including Amis' father Kingsley. It is also a fairly rigorous, though often unoriginal forensic portrait of Stalin's particular breed of tyranny, which Amis attributes both to his insanity as well as the totalitarian nature of the Marxist-Leninist system which he inherited.This book might be though of as a letter to those of the old left such as Christopher Hitchens, who continue to derive a fair amount of laughter and enjoyment for their past follies. Amis breaks from his historiography in these moments, and he imposes his own anti-communism on Hitchens' work; he contrives dicey judgments such as,"although I always liked Christopher's journalism, there seemed to me to be something wrong with it, something faintly but pervasively self-defeating: the sense that the truth could be postponed. This flaw disappeared in 1989, and his prose made immense gains in burnish and authority. I used to attribute the change to the death of Christopher's father, late in 1988, and to subsequent convulsions in his life. It had little or nothing to do with that, I now see. It had to do with the collapse of Communism" (pg. 47).This is painting with a broad brush; one could easily make the case that Hitchens' journalistic authority diminished after his stance on Iraq in 2003. Still, Amis does a competent job of presenting the facts to the members of the hard left such as Hitchens, who have always taken a flippant tone in evaluating the USSR.Amis' historical work is fine, though it is generally unvaried and unoriginal; he relies mostly on Alexander Solzhenitsyn's standard historical accounts in the Gulag Archipelago Volumes, which are more than competent and standard. There are also some interesting looks at the correspondence between Nabokov and Edmund Wilson during this period. However, Amis' occasionally bizarre political oversimplifications, i.e. "[a]s in Germany, this was the birth of mass-media propaganda; people were unaware, then, that propaganda was propaganda-and propaganda worked" (pg. 213). Such declarations are less then insightful, and fail to provide adequate explanations as to Stalin's popularity. Koba the Dread is still a fairly competent evaluation of Stalin's life and politics, and it provides a fair and brief overview of the Soviet Union for readers who desire a quick blow-by-blow, even if it is derivative of Solzhenitsyn.

A minor work by Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard. Two old masters, Atzbacher and Reger, meet in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches museum, as is their daily habit, to reflect on the decline of modern European culture. Bernhard proceeds in his typically famous style-with enormously winding sentences that fill pages with complaints, anecdotes, commentaries, and rants. This little book is much more traditional than his finer novels, and one gets the impression that it was underdeveloped in its conception. We find endlessly repetitious complaints about Vienna's bourgeoisie and its anti-intellectualism. Yet there is none of the urgency we find with the great characters developed in Der Untergeher or Correction. A slim achievement.

Errol Morris' erratic documentary that fuses commentary with a lion tamer, a topiary gardener, a biologist specializing in mole rats, and a robot designer at M.I.T. The film is at times very interesting, Morris succeeds in fusing the four topics together and the film becomes something very different than one expects. But the black and white angled slow motion photography is poor form, and Phillip Glass's dramatic score tries to rivet you when the material is merely contemplative.

Avi Shlaim is in the school of what are called "The New Historians" on the Arab-Israeli conflict, along with Benny Morris who broke new ground in historical analysis with the Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem. This text by Shlaim is a great single volume overview of the history of the conflict, from 1948 and the war of independence leading all the way up to 1999. The thesis of his book is that the Zionist movement eventually adopted the political philosophy of Ze'ev Jabotinksy with his ideas on revisionist Zionism, his argument being that the Zionists must build up and Iron Wall in the Middle East to create the State of Israel, with the intention of allowing the Arabs in after they give up the fight. Essentially it's an ideology that breaks down as: the best defense is a good offense. And Shlaim makes a compelling case in his book, doing so as objectively as he can. He traces the origins of the first Arab war, the Suez War, the June 1967 war, the Yom Kippur war, and so on, leading up to the collision with the Palestinians and the still going occupation. The flaw in this text is that while Shlaim is able to draw on a wealth of primary Israeli sources (providing an excellent bibliography), he is unable to reveal Arab planning as he cites very few Arab sources. I don't pretend to know the truth about this conflict; there probably will not be an objective account on this for another 100 years for all I know. However, I think Shlaim is done an excellent job reviewing Israel's history and political policies in the Arab world, and anyone who is new to this topic should start here.

For many, this dialogue represents the culmination of Platonic thought. Theatetus and the Eleatic stranger announce a program of determination of the function and essence of the Sophist. They proceed by way of dialectical bifurcation; in a way this text is about the process of bifurcation itself. We are left with little to think about the Sophist in positive terms. Rather, we are left with the essence of sophistry as a kind of semblance-the sophist creates the impression of true knowledge. However, at the heart of this text is a metaphysical questioning of the meaning of being itself: "Then clarify this for us, since we're confused by it. What do you want to signify when you say being? Obviously you've known for a long time. We thought we did, but now we're confused about it." This brief problematic would of course find itself as the opening quotation of Heidegger's Being and Time. The Sophist remains one of the most crucial and mysterious of all metaphysical texts.

The second bizarre hippy satire from a young Brian DePalma (the first being Greetings), and featuring a remarkably spontaneous Robert DeNiro as a young Viet Nam vet new in the city and looking for work. The film (while noticeably dated), is practically an act of radicalism in itself as DeNiro boyishly tries to seduce his neighbors while simultaneously filming the act from his apartment to turn it into a work of explosive pornography. DePalma is clever here; he manages to transform the neighboring windows into fixed frames reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rear Window. Once a failure, DeNiro performs as a reactionary police officer in an all African American theater troupe's educational TV program, in which blacks offer liberal whites the opportunity to experience African Americanism as they beat and rape them in white-face; this sequence is particularly strange and not all together funny until DeNiro arrives as the cop. And finally, he transforms himself once again into a guerilla revolutionary, bombing Laundromats and disguising himself as a bourgeois salesman. This final section is probably the most enjoyable and improvised, though it contains none of the creativity of the first section. The film is interesting if for nothing else, because one gets to witness DePalma and DeNiro stylistically severed from their current work. However, the film seems to try to satirize everything in our society, when in fact it comes across as though it has satirized nothing.

Don Dellilo's 'White Noise' features an all-too familiar professor of 'Hitler Studies' at a fine college where he lives with his wife and precocious children. He admits that he does not speak German and is not particularly interested in the politics of Nazism, he is interested merely in the culture. This novel is a curiously fun combination of academic/farce, social satire, dystopia, and post-modern experiment. The characters live embedded in 'White Noise,' they are immersed in the 1980's culture of static/electronic meaninglessness until a chemical spill is unleashed and changes everyone's lives forever. I enjoyed Dellilo's dark and sardonic prose immensely, but I couldn't help feeling that his metaphors became a bit obvious as the story progressed. Dellilo becomes less and less concerned with his characters and more concerned with his themes. This is of course an entirely subjective preference, but I grew detached from this work as the fine characters drifted into the symbolic.

Find out how we will achieve peace through war and continual conflict. This is an important, though troubling work of political philosophy by the great thinker, though it is mediocre when compared to the historical dialectics of Hegel. For evidence of Kant's racism/ethnocentrism, read the section on Cosmopolitanism, in which Kant effectively excludes all humans outside of the Ancient Greece and the West from the human project. Well, one can't assume a great transcendental thinker will also be enlightened in politics; sad considering the "Enlightenment" is one of Kant's primary concerns in the book.

Consider the Lobster is a collection of muscular essays from the late David Foster Wallace on an absurdly wide range of topics. Each of them was commissioned by a particular magazine with a particular topic, hence Wallace's tendency to direct his voice at his readers like a canon. However, Wallace can never be contained by the banalities of his topic here. His work on the AVA's is a particularly damning portrait of the pornography industry, in all its unimaginable insanity and sadness. I particularly like the piece on the American Usage Wars, which involves an impressive demonstration of Wallace's knowledge regarding the history of English grammar debates over the course of the last several decades. Not all of the pieces here are great-the one on McCain in particular is repetitive and mundane. And DFW's tendency to use lengthy footnotes to 'fragment the linearity' of his text is a mere affectation. Still, this represents the work of a great mind, whose creativity and intellect will sorely be missed.

Alan Sokal, physics professor at New York University submitted an essay, `Transgressing the Boundaries,' to the prestigious journal Social Text, in 1996. The article was a deliberate hoax intended to mimic the deliberate obscurantism of the Post-Modernist/Post-Structuralist French intellectual community that had coalesced since the 1960's. This book, coauthored with Jean Bricmont, attempts to expose the post-modern movement for their asinine misappropriations of science and mathematics in a vain attempt to consolidate their academic positions. The authors under scrutiny are psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, literary theorist Julia Kristeva, feminist Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Paul Virilio, and `Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science' and the misappropriation of Godel's theorem, and abuses in the field of astrophysics.In all fairness, the authors are able to land a couple of substantive blows against Lacan's abstruse use of mathematics in psychoanalysis, and Irigaray's unwise talk of `white male science,' but Sokal and Bricmont don't have their logic together, they make to many critical leaps in the inquiry. Without wanting to get into an involved exegesis of the divisions between analytic and continental philosophy that have existed since the beginning of the 20th century, I will simply say that as a general a priori principle of the human mind, the former believes in objective truth, and the latter is more skeptical, particularly of the principles of the enlightenment. But I am not so sure that Bricmont and Sokal are aware of the history of this division, and the key thinkers that have impacted the division. For example, in a tirade against Epistemic Relativism, the authors writes: "This relativist zeitgeist originates partly from contemporary works in the philosophy of science, such as Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Paul Feyerabend's Against Method, and partly from extrapolations of these philosophers' work by their successors" (51). Sokal and Bricmont go on to write in a footnote that "There are, of course, many other sources of the relativist zeitgeist, from Romanticism to Heidegger, but we shall not deal with them here" (ibid). Yes, never mind Heidegger, arguably the most important philosopher of the 20th century and the leading figure in the existentialist/post-modern movement in continental philosophy. Never mind his essay `Modern Science, Metaphysics, and Mathematics' which outlines a number of problems with reviewing the accomplishments of philosophy from a scientific point of view.The authors of this text constantly misunderstand the achievements of `Enlightenment' philosophers that they believe the post-modern movement has digressed from, like Descartes and Hume. They write: "The universality of Humean skepticism is also its weakness. Of course, it is irrefutable. But since no one is systematically skeptical (when he or she is sincere) with respect to ordinary knowledge, one ought to ask why skepticism is rejected in that domain and why it would nevertheless be valid when applied elsewhere for instance, to scientific knowledge" (55). What are we supposed to take from this sentence? That we should believe that modern science objectively seeks the truth because...no one actually is a skeptic? Hume argues cogently in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding that knowledge of causality can never truly be attained or demonstrably proven, it is merely an appearance based on the properties of a close relation in time and contiguity which deludes our senses. Why then, should we believe in the empirical sciences? The authors merely revert to (often incorrect) digressions on Popper's writings on falsifiability which the authors still seem to think is obsolete and the irrelevance of Cartesian rationalism. In short, they don't answer the problems philosophy has posed to the natural sciences. Sokal and Bricmont don't bother to mention anything about Foucault's archeology of the human sciences in `the Order of Things,' nor do they address any of the classical problems of epistemology and human knowledge raised by Kant or Hegel.The largest problem with `Fashionable Nonsense' is that the authors take some legitimate criticisms and deduce too much from them. It is worth exposing a thinker for being unclear, meaningless, or irrelevant. However, they go entirely too far in attempting to write off the whole of post-modernity as sheer charlatanism based on a moderate amount of legitimate criticisms. What of the writings of Roland Barthes? What of Levinas? And what about the achievements of post-modern anthropologists like Pierre Bourdieu? After all, the vast majority of the work that is being done in these intellectual domains are more focused on the humanities, on literature, on politics and history, and purely philosophical activities like ontology or phenomenology that have nothing to do whatever with science. Sokal and Bricmont don't have their logic together. They write in their epilogue: "1. It is a good idea to know what one is talking about" (185). Yet I doubt they know anything about the history of philosophy outside of what they have read in Bertrand Russell. They seem to believe in the objective principles of truth established in the Enlightenment, but their political tirade does not mention a word of Rousseau or Nietzsche. They pay no attention to the intellectual bombs dropped on structuralism by Derrida, or by the Marxist analyses of Althusser. In short, they don't know what they are talking about. How ironic.

Bukowski earned himself a special place in American literature with the publication of this short, tersely written tragicomedy about Henry Chinaski, a drunken womanizer who joins the postal service. Bukowski is able to carry on the tradition of a self-consciously imposed Hemingwayesque masculinity, without being overly derivative. Bukowski's landscape is modern day LA, and his strength as a writer here is in his ability to evoke the excitement of the spontaneity his life must have contained. His characters and scenarios capture the wearisome bureaucracy of modern-day American life without being pedantic or polemical; Bukowski's prose is always breezy, humorous, and strong. Perhaps the novel's only weak section is the series of constructed messages delivered by the Postal-Service to Chinaski, demonstrating his negligence and alcoholism. A more experienced novelist would have clipped this section down. Nevertheless, Post Office is an enjoyable read, not a provocative statement like Hunter S. Thompson's `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' it actually reminds you of Thompson's first novel, `The Rum Diary,' though Bukowski's character and command with the typewriter was stronger as a beginner than the latter.

French anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu has composed an investigation into the political-socio context of the revisionist Germany in which Martin Heidegger was imbedded, to attempt to explain how the great philosopher could have been involved in such a pathological political enterprise as National Socialism. Bourdieu does not excuse Heidegger's involvement, but he does allow him the necessary failings of `being-in-the-world.' This book might have been re-titled `the political ontics of Martin Heidegger. Bourdieu writes, "no single ideologue mobilizes all of the available schemata, which, for this reason, neither fulfill the same functions nor have equal importance in the different `systems' in which they are inserted" (25). Each thinker (even the greatest), operates within an amorphous politico-socio context, the context has no center, rather the center is "everywhere and nowhere" (ibid.), at the same time in history. But does this excuse Heidegger's silence? I think not. Bourdieu writes that "the frontier between politics and philosophy is a genuine ontological threshold: the notions relating to practical, everyday experience, and the words that denote them, undergo a radical transformation which renders them barely recognizable in the eyes of those who have agreed to make the magical leap into the other universe" (36). There is a necessary will to remove oneself from the everyday world if one is to engage in metaphysical thinking, and Heidegger removed himself to perhaps a greater degree than any other thinker of his era. Yet Bordieu believes that Heidegger's ontological project is, despite all appearances, political to the core. He relates the conceptualization of `resoluteness' in Being and Time, to the resoluteness of the nihilism inherent in National Socialism. Perhaps he is playing a bit lose with Heidegger's concrete descriptions. Additionally, on the question of Heidegger's possible anti-semitism, Bourdieu is slightly ambiguous. He argues that Heidegger participated in anti-semitic discourse, but that it was on account of his immersion in an anti-semitic cultural atmosphere (which he undeniably was living). Bourdieu writes that "To fully understand the discreetly anti-semitic over-determination of the whole Heideggerian relation to the intellectual world, it would be necessary to recreate the whole ideological atmosphere with which Heidegger was inevitably impregnated" (120, fn.19), unfortunately, Bourdieu only undergoes a preliminary recreation. Never the less the Political Ontology of Martin Heidegger is a fascinating and enormously helpful read.

Rosenbaum proves himself once again to be among the most knowledgeable and eloquent film critics in print today. Unlike some of his other volumes such as "Movie Wars," Rosenbaum doesn't discuss the grim realities of corporate Hollywood so much (although he does comment on filmmakers who have been treated unfairly by the system), as he evaluates directors and films which he believes are of historical and artistic importance, such as Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Eric Von Stroheim, Yasujiro Ozu, and Sam Fuller. Rosenbaum writes with clarity and insight on a number of film-related topics, such as screenwriting and mise en scene. He's remarkably intelligent and has a keen eye for film aesthetics; he's passionate about the French director Jacques Tati which is slightly problematic because Rosenbaum worked as an assistant for Tati for a time which may slant his opinions of the auteur. Never the less, Essential Cinema is one of the best collections of film criticism I've read in a while, and his personal favorite 1,000 movies list is a valuable resource, though I disagree with a number of selections. The book is a worthwhile purchase for any cinephile.

One of Sontag's earlier collections of aesthetic essays, including insightful reflections on the work of Jean-Luc Godard, Ingmar Bergman, and some philosophy and politics such as an essay on Cioran. Sontag's writing is always lucid and intelligent; she had the rare gift of being able to express her complex and specified perceptions of art and their relation to the world. Perhaps, the most exciting essay in this volume is her account of her solidarity mission in North Vietnam, titled Trip to Hanoi. Here she reveals the sociological/political dynamics of the Vietnamese communists and their struggle to establish an independent country in the face of US bombardment and aggression. Sontag was correct in her adamant dismissal of US attempts to recapture the region. However, Sontag is not concerned about political correctness; she doesn't romanticize the Vietnamese too overtly. She indicates that the political system may be just and appropriate, yet she maintains that she values her country as a cultural and artistic resource despite its imperialistic and wasteful character. Occasionally Sontag misses the mark in her criticism of American-European culture, calling the white race a "cancer," but maybe she was right. Also included, is an interesting essay comparing theater to film, in which she argues that the latter yields more potential as a high art. She also writes an intriguing essay reminiscent of her work on "camp" called The Pornographic Imagination, in which she compares science-fiction and fantasy literature to pornography. Style of Radical Will is a potent and layered read from what was once one of our greatest public intellectuals.

Martin Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche represent the most penetrating and thoughtful inquiries in all of Nietzsche scholarship. This volume contains Volume I: The Will to Power as Art, and Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same. Heidegger was the first thinker to repudiate the common view that Nietzsche's doctrine of 'Eternal Return' was a mere curiosity-a mythological playing that detracted from his 'serious' political ideas regarding will to power. Heidegger reorients our understanding of Nietzsche back to the eternal recurrence of the same, and argues that it is both the central idea of Nietzsche's philosophy as well as the grounding principle of will to power. Heidegger's work on the doctrine of eternal return are practically incomparable in terms of their rigor and creativity. He has successfully placed Nietzsche's work as the total overcoming of Platonism and as the consummation of Western Metaphysics. A true tour de force of philosophical inquiry.

Is this the most aesthetically balanced and lush of Fassbinder's films? Perhaps. In a Year of 13 Moons is a singularly unique study of a transvestite's slow and painful disintegration. Through an interplay of comic self-consciousness and oblique representations of the tragic, Fassbinder's characters manage to radiate above the surface of his simple schema. Also, there are extraordinary passages of internal narration-in particular at the slaughterhouse. This film claws its way around its material and culminates with a magnificent resolution of its tragic elements.

This biography doesn't have much to offer for those who are more or less familiar with Chomsky's work. On a side note, there isn't much to say about Chomsky's life beyond his work, which is obviously all-consuming. As such, the biographer is reduced to an amateurish overview of Chomsky's career and influences which are all together pretty dry and unsatisfying. It's much better to get an understanding of Chomsky's work from his own words, I highly recommend "Understanding Power, and "Language and Politics," for instance. Perhaps the only thing that kept me reading is the author's overview of Chomsky's political development as an activist and scholar. There are some excellent selections going into the various political literatures that helped shape Chomsky's ideology as a young person. Unfortunately, the biographer takes it upon himself to subjectively defend Chomsky in some of his more controversial endeavors. I'm referring now to the Robert Faurrison affair. The author should have simply let Chomsky's defense of the matter speak for itself but instead he chooses to attack an author who was critical of Chomsky by explaining an encounter he had in which he heard the author speak give a lecture on the topic in which he didn't seem to have a handling of the material which the biographer decides is proof that he didn't actually read his book. This is a task for another text and shouldn't have been included. An average read on the whole, though it may be useful as an overview for those who are new to Chomsky.

This is Novalis' masterpiece. An absolutely sublime collection of six poetic hymns, each of which centering on a deeply routed problematic configured within Novalis' complicated commitments. The symbolism and imagery of the night is particularly luminous here-it is clear that Novalis was preoccupied with an implicit death-drive. This work is also the thinker's most decisively Christian work, which has turned off readers to it in the modern era. Considered in terms of its place in the history of the Romantic movement, this work should be regarded among the masters like Tieck, Goethe, and the like.

This is an updated and expanded version of Chomsky's `Fateful Triangle,' originally published in 1983 after Israel's invasion into Lebanon. The updated section (Washington's `Peace Process') is perhaps the most concise, yet revealing attempt to explicate the inner-workings of the negotiations between the PLO, Israel, and the U.S. during the nineties and leading up to the collapse of the process the birth of the second intifada in 2000. In it, Chomsky demonstrates quite conclusively, that there is an international solution to the conflict between the PLO and Israel, and that it resides quite straightforwardly in the domain of international law, namely U.N. resolution 242. Contrary to popular interpretation, Israel has been steadfast in its rejection of the principles of resolution 242, and that the PLO has wavered over the years between rejecting and accepting the policy. There was a window of time in which Arafat and the PLO were willing to begin implementing 242 in the 70's, but unfortunately Israel rejected it at the time. The basic tenets of 242 were reintroduced in the Taba accords, which were offered by Israel and then accepted by the PLO, but Israel subsequently called off the settlement prior to the election. What remains is Israel's continued effort to impose a military Bantustan on the Palestinian people in an almost explicit attempt to drive the population out of the West bank and the Gaza strip and into the neighboring Arab states. The U.S. continues to provide blanket support for the occupation and illegal settlements.Fateful Triangle is an elaborately researched work of political observation, particularly on Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which was really a proxy attempt to crush the PLO which was residing in the southern region of the state. Chomsky demonstrates (as close to conclusively as possible in political science) that not only did the Israelis (under the military leadership of Sharon) deliberately turn the other cheek during the Sabra and Shatila massacre, but that Sharon and others were actually involved in preparing the atrocities (see chpt. 6 `Aftermath' pgs. 329-440). Additionally, he manages to demonstrate that the Israeli invasion of Lebanon was an act of military aggression, similar now to the US's invasion of Iraq in 03. The war in Lebanon cost roughly 30,000 lives and left the region devastated ( I suspect that Israel's recent incursion into the region may do even more damage). Aside from Robert Fisk's great book `Pity the Nation,' `Fateful Triangle' may prove to be the most elaborate and well documented works of political literature in the region.Chomsky's research is truly impressive. This book contains roughly 1,550 footnotes, with a huge range of sources, including mainstream right newspapers (i.e. Wall Street Journal) and papers on the left (i.e. New York Times). He also refers to a number of Israeli historians (i.e. Morris and Shlaim), and both liberal and conservative Jewish magazines (commentary and Dissent), also left-wing and mainstream liberal magazines (i.e. New Republic and Z mag). You can disagree with the ideology and the point of view, but you cannot deny the sheer volume of sources. It's difficult to explain the almost unanimous refusal to review this book among the mainstream press upon the time of publication, but it passed almost unnoticed. Those who have commented on the book have usually criticized Chomsky's `tone' and his apparent use of `selective quotation.' On the latter charge I can only say that all political scientists must ultimately decide which quotes and sources they are going to include, and which they are going to exclude, it's simply the nature of the field. On the former charge, I must admit that on a few occasions, Chomsky's tone is needlessly hostile. For example, while discussing the IDF's indolence with regard to monitoring Sabra and Shatila, Chomsky quotes Thomas Friedman to the fact that "whether the Israelis actually looked down and saw what was happening was unkown," adding that "it is also not clear whether this is intended as irony" (366). This is a needless and polemical reference to the Holocaust. Chomsky is Jewish and is not an anti-semite, but he applies harsh and rigorous (perhaps occasionally unfair) standards to the state of Israel, which is the product of the policy of genocide implemented against European Jewry during WWII. There is no need to compare the Israeli atrocities to the atrocities of the Nazis; it gets historians and scholars alike nowhere in penetrating into the truth of the current conflict.

Of course Deleuze and Guattari's self-explication does not read like an introduction to philosophy, but this compact and rich text is a wonderful and provocative entry into their work. Deleuze has brilliantly reconceived philosophy as the production of concepts and has attempted to reintroduce metaphysics back into the project of creative thinking. If accepted, this is a radical and crucial turning point in the development of contemporary philosophy-Heidegger may not have the final word on metaphysics after all. This difficult text is composed of three essential parts, concepts, science, and art. There are mordantly brilliant critiques of logic and positivism here, as well as crucial articulations of Deleuze's commitment to artistic expression. In the final analysis, it is the `plane of immanence' that grips me most completely. The power and radicality of Deleuzian metaphysics will be felt for a long time.

Rimbaud skillfully draws the reader into the world of damnation, the world of the self. He confronts the essence of nihilism and self-loathing in this remarkable poem, composed at the astonishing age of 19. Like Dante, Milton, and perhaps Pound, Rimbaud is able to bend the language to engage the reader in a transcendental understanding of the human condition and psyche.There are poems in here of promethean beauty that prefigure the rebellious spirit of French artistic bohemians in the dawn of the 20th century:"Long ago, if my memory serves, life was a feast where every heart was open, where every wined flowed. One night, I sat Beauty on my knee.-And I found her bitter.-And Ihurt her.I took arms against justice.I fled, entrusting my treasure to you, o witches, o misery, o hate.I snuffled any hint of human hope from my consciousness. I made the muffled leap of a wild beast into any hint of joy, to strangle it. (3).This is an altogether excellent edition of Season and Hell and Illuminations, with a lucid and stark translation by Wyatt Mason. The Modern English library has also included the original French text, complete with a chronology of the poet's life and comprehensive facsimiles of the original texts for true bookworms who want to look at Rimbaud's corrections.

The infamous pamphlet that established the basic strategies for military and city-state conquest for ages. Machiavelli looks to Caesar Borgia as his model of the ideal, calculating militant leader. Machiavelli calls for an appeal to the people through fear and respect, insisting that they must be treated well enough to maintain control. He writes: "Is it better to be loved or feared, or vice versa? I don't doubt that every prince would like to be both; but since it is hard to accommodate these qualities, if you have to make a choice, to be feared is much safer than to be loved. For it is a good general rule about men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, liars and deceivers, fearful of danger and greedy for gain."The Prince is the bible of modern realpolitik. It is a cynical tract containing twenty six guidelines for taking (and maintaining power). Machiavelli supports his arguments with an astonishing depth and breadth of understanding of military history, and this work remains one of the great accounts of military strategy, along with Thucydides and Hobbes.

A true masterpiece of the Weimar era. Doblib's Berlin Alexanderplatz is a profoundly charged-allegorical representation of a nation undergoing pathological convulsions. It is the story of Franz Biberkopf, a man who has been released from jail (for manslaughter) and who is determined to live a moral life. But Franz will quickly find out that such a life is no longer possible in a world where gangsters and fascist hoodlums control everything, a world where the only sense of recognition available is through moral bondage. D&ouml;blin's prose is constantly in flux--by turns, the perspective of Berlin Alexanderplatz shifts from the voice of narrative omniscience, to internal (almost stream-of-consciousness) narration, and freely inserts itself into the consciousness of sustaining characters. Through the combination of rapidly alternating registers and perspectives, D&ouml;blin's prose is able to modulate between the descriptive, the allegorical, as well as the surreal. While officially classified as a work of "expressionism," Berlin Alexanderplatz is nevertheless a remarkably prescient representation of the historical rise of National Socialism. An astonishing masterpiece-one of the major works of the century, beyond any doubt.

In the lost city of Alexandria a group of expatriots fall into a life of mysticism and sensuality. The opening novel of Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria quartet is a highly polished and intriguing work which tends to create a life of its own as one gets into it. Although Durrell's prose is clearly out of style, the intricate design and rhythm of life he has created in this imaginary place is truly a great achievement. The object of fascination in this introductory work is Justine, the beautiful Jewess of everyone's fancy. Durrell is dealing with post-WWII relativism and the need for Europeans to return 'to an earlier state of things' in the Freudian sense. He has created a complex interweaving of characters; they have escaped their own landscape, but unlike the existentialists, Durrell's portrait insists that true freedom is an illusion.

A phenomenal triumph of form and scale from the master of the nonsensical, David Lynch. I think that Lynch has truly exploded film itself with this 3-hour opus, and he has truly abandoned the notion of "marketability." Laura Dern gives perhaps the greatest performance of her career as multiple characters, the first of which is an actress hired under less than clear circumstances to appear in a commercial melodrama called On High and Blue Tomorrows. What is incredible about Inland Empire is how engaging it remains despite its incoherent plot and structure. Lynch is hitting you with a nightmarish intensity that can be felt, and only understood within the internal logic of the subconscious. This movie is scary, funny, ironic, complex, and strangely moving all at the same time. A true masterpiece, one the most impressive films of the decade.

A miraculous text of the medieval period. Boethius' genius was that of a fusion of early Christian theology with Platonism. The interplay between the philosophical and the poetic is the engine that drives this enigmatic and beautiful dialogue on the nature of fortune, belief, happiness, and God. Lady Philosophy's inspired commentary is often interpreted as a divine release from materiality. The problem of fate and free will is also given a good working over in the final book, with extremely mysterious results.

Of course Nietzsche is famous for his misogyny, yet David Krell unearths neglected material in order to demonstrate a more complex and nuanced relationship to woman in Nietzsche's thought. Krell examines Nietzsche's planned attempt to write a rendition of Empedocles, which is postponed indefinitely, thus giving us a window into Nietzsche's fundamental failure to really deal with the theme of woman. There are also fascinating accounts of abandoned versions of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra,' which indicates a failure to confront death. However, Krell's concluding remarks are rather limited-he suggests that Nietzsche's problematic relation to woman was a consequence of the women in his own life. The suggestion is probably correct, but Krell fails to really explore the idea, though it would clearly require another study all together.

A strange and often rambling account of the Apollo II mission to the moon--Mailer's journalistic methodology is at once absolutely brilliant and completely without discipline. On the one hand, Mailer provides dry, sober accounts of the details that constitute NASA's preparation for the mission, as well as long-burdensome descriptions of the technologies that went into that extraordinary period of aeronautics. Counterpoised to such accounts are long, digressive, often fascinating sociological streams-of-consciousness which touch on a myriad of subjects--they include everything from the cultural revolution of the 60's to his ongoing divorce. Mailer sometimes betrays his own boredom with his task in a way that actually enhances this book--his accounts of the psychology of machines is an excellent rumination on the peculiar way in which NASA's paradigm is indicative of the Protestant work ethic. If only Mailer had managed to organize this text according to a more coherent logic it would have been a great book.

Jean-Luc Godard's quasi-update of Dante's Divine Comedy set to the modern world. The first segment of the film is hell and it only runs at about 10 minutes. In it, Godard has cobbled together a devastating montage of scenes of human destruction from the holocaust, Vietnam, the American Civil War, and other scenes of warfare and destruction, all compiled from documentary and movie footage. It's an impressive sequence as he overlaps the scenes of horror over the sounds of a melodic piano score. Then the film moves into limbo, the section usually regarded as the least interesting of Dante's cantos. Godard spends the bulk of his time on this section. In it, a French Jewish journalist attends a literary conference and meets Godard as himself and meets the Palestinian poet Mohmoud Darwish and discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She travels to Sarejevo and witnesses the aftermath of Serbian destruction (a topic which Godard is clearly haunted with), and includes some direct views on cinema from Godard himself. The final section is in paradise. It features perplexing images with the protagonist in a beautiful forest guarded by American soldiers. Notre Musique is about the state of the world at the beginning of the 21st century. It is a powerful and esoteric rumination of the art and history of the past, and a foreboding insight into what the future may look like. The film includes a wonderful piano score from Sibelius and Tchaikovsky and beautiful color photography from Julien Hirsh. The film was shot in 1:33 aspect ratio so don't expect the DVD to appear in scope.

In Jean Renoir's introduction to this film the great master cites Rumer Godden's book The River as the greatest work of literature about English colonialism in India. I can think of at least two books that are greater, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, and George Orwell's Burmese Days, two works of literature which seem to indicate that Britain's endeavors in India produced more harm than a few damaged human relations among the English.Never the less, Jean Renoir brings unbelievable beauty to this film, which was his first attempt at full Technicolor, and it's a glorious attempt, called the most beautiful color film (along with Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes) by Martin Scorsese.The color has a warm subtlety and grace which can only be described as characteristic as his father's paintings, cheap as that sounds.Is The River the Rules of the Game of Renoir's color period, as Andre Bazin claims? No, I'm afraid no movie is as good as The Rules of the Game, yet this is a wonderful and important work all the same.

Fritz Lang's silent crime thriller pits a government agent (Willy Fritsch) against a scheming international banker who is stealing government documents. Considered an overlooked, but crucial part of Lang's impressive canon and an important influence on the thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock; it does have some first-rate cutting and painterly images of the city's dense layering. However, (this version at least) is simply way too long. One can anticipate what is going to happen later in the film with more than hour to go. The film could easily afford to lose some where in the order of one hour of its footage. A necessary viewing for anyone interested in the work of Fritz Lang all the same.

A remarkable collection of essays and lectures all of which revolve around the subject of language. For Foucault, Discourse represents a context within which power relations exist. The two most noted essays in this collection are 'What is an Author?' and 'Nietzsche, Genealogy, History.'It is in the latter that one can discern the enormous impact that Nietzsche has made on Foucault's archaeological project. He engages in a discussion on the nature of history as it relates to power relations and truth. Foucault writes: "The successes of history belong to those who had used them, to disguise themselves so as to pervert them, invert their meaning, and redirect them against those who had initially imposed them; controlling this complex mechanism, they will make it function so as to overcome the rulers through their own rules" (151).This is a remarkable collection with lectures and essays ranging from Borges and Holderlin to Deleuze. One can also find his explication of the 'History of Systems of Thought' as a discipline which would dominate his attention in the final years of his life.

Cornelius Castoriadis is a shamefully under-read figure in philosophy and critical theory. His contributions to philosophy, political theory, economics, and psychoanalysis are extraordinary in their clarity and originality. This immense collection of essays provides a picture of Castoriadis' project of "autonomy" in toto. It includes selections from the Imaginary Institution of Society as well as a number of his other major works. Castoriadis asserted himself very early on as a thoughtful socialist, deeply critical of the Marxist-Leninist tradition, and devoted to an autonomous politics which was to give full scope to the investments of the human psyche. Additionally, Castoriadis possessed an extraordinary knowledge of mathematics and the history of science and his deeper ontology is heavily reliant on these domains. This collection also indexes his brilliant criticisms of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, and the Continental tradition. A tour de force of original thinking.

This is a remarkable contribution from Freud that is almost entirely ignored by psychology on account of its lack of applicability. But that is a tragedy, because this is a work of first-rate thinking. Freud explores the `Uncanny,' the no longer being at home, and traces its dimensions through literature, dreams, and childhood memories. He also contributes a brilliant speculation into Leonardo Da Vinci, later coined as an exercise in `psychobiography', in which he magnificently uses a single memory to investigate the conflicts and dilemmas of Leonardo's childhood and subsequent artistry and genius. This is a crucial text in Freud's vast body of work, I urge you to read it.

Hofstader's capable translation of these extraordinary Heidegger essays makes this one of the indispensable books of 20th century philosophy. This collection is especially indicative of Heidegger's 'turn' to art and poetry, particularly in his amazingly complex 'Origin of the Work of Art' and 'Poetically, Man Dwells.' 'The Thing' is also a remarkable essay in Heidegger's descriptions of the closing of distances in modernity, as well as his phenomenological observations of the relation between things and world. This is an excellent representation of Heidegger's philosophy of Language, and Hofstader has translated them quite well, even if the translations of Holderlin are a bit too cautious.

This comprehensive collection of essays by Cornelius Castoriadis distills the essential trajectory of his thinking from 'Socialism or Barbarism' to the later work on the social imaginary. Castoriadis remains an anti-Marxist revolutionary who is seeking an alternative to the barbarity of capitalism, which he finds in rather obscure postulations regarding 'autonomy.' He has situated himself as a combatant of what he calls, 'philosophical determinatedness.' Castoriadis often resorts to awful neologisms (Magma, identitiary politics), which are neither interesting nor analytically useful. Although he is under-read today his philosophical skewering of the Western tradition is often embarrassingly swift and reductive.

I confess that this is my first Herta M&uuml;ller novel, and I was at first pulled in by the strange lyricism of her voice as well as the obliqueness of her symbolism. This is the story of several young people, living under the totalitarian conditions of Ceausescu's Romania. After the suicide of their friend Lola, each of them leaves the countryside to try out life in the city. However, things turn for the worse in this desperately dark, stifling presentation of life within a police-state. Admittedly, M&uuml;ller's narrative eventually spirals into repetition and loses the initial force of the first half of the novel. Still, clearly the work of true talent.

The great figures collected here exchange disagreements vis-&agrave;-vis the status of modern aesthetics in the 20th century. We see here Lukacs' famous critique of the avant-garde movements in literature, which is then rebuked by mordantly brilliant works of criticism from Brecht and Adorno. This is an absolutely vital collection for anyone interested in the history of political aesthetics in the 20th century.

An excellent compendium of essays chronicling the history of the Soviet Union from the earliest months of the Bolshevik Revolution under Lenin to the totalitarian system of Stalin. The most important contributor to this collection is Tony Cliff who coined the term 'State Capitalism,' which states that the Soviet Union under Stalin was not a workers' state, nor was it a degenerated workers' state as Trotsky would later describe it. Rather it was State Capitalist in that the Red Bureaucracy formed a distinctly separate class from the proletariat. Chris Harman also elaborates on the failure of the revolution, arguing that it was not an inherent outcome of the project but that external imperialist pressures and internal crises caused the collapse of socialism. Harman writes: "By 1927 little remained of the proletarian democracy of 1917. But this could hardly be blamed on those who took power in October. For during a long and bitter struggle against counter-revolution and foreign invasion the working class that had made the revolution was itself decimated. Cut off from its sources of raw materials, industry ground to a prolonged halt" (39). This is an excellent book detailing the complex transitions of the Soviet Union from the period of its inception all the way to its final collapse in 1990. However, some of the writing overlaps between essays and there a number of typos which need correcting.

Michael Ondaatje's haunting portrait of the mythical cornet player, Buddy Bolden, is a dimly poetic work of masterful writing. Set in the early years of 20th century New Orleans, Ondaatje masterfully recreates the atmosphere of African American life within the framework of their complex relationship to American art. Structured in a series of minimalist vignettes, the novel unfolds as a sequence of brief and faded snapshots which evoke the powerful degeneration of Buddy Bolden's genius. This is a remarkable work of fiction and a truly unique representation of the origins of Jazz-shadowed with a refined sense of the tragic.

Martin Amis' long (perhaps long-winded) novel about a femme fatale-psychic who is predisposed to being murdered as she entraps Keith Talent, a brutish dart player, and Guy Clinch, a struggling writer into her web of seduction and deceit. Amis pads this thin story with typically entertaining and satisfying scenarios that he seems to have a knack for, but the novel just isn't nearly as interesting as his Information or Money. At some point during the project, Amis lost touch with the original force of his conception, and you can tell that the rest of the material is simply a weak attempt to complete the aborted project. Not a bad read, but probably too much of a commitment for the quality, even among fans of Amis' usually interesting prose.

Plato's poetic masterpiece remains the most pleasurable and beautiful of his dialogues. An extraordinary account of the nature of love as eros, this text is paradigmatic in its application of myth, dialectic, and poesis. Socrates reports on the speech of Diotima, perhaps one of the most extraordinary of Platonic accounts-her speech is a miraculous presentation of the ascension of erotic love and the nature of desire. This is a brilliant presentation of the forms, and the only account devoted to a god (eros). Nehamas' translation remains the best. The Symposium continues to complicate the classical distinction between philosophy and poetry, between logos and poesis. It is a sublime literary achievement.

Heidegger's 1924 lecture on the Concept of time is an unusually clear enunciation of many of the central concepts bearing on the phenomenology of temporality. Much of this lecture would later be elaborated and developed in his celebrated Being and Time, and indeed, The Concept of Time is often called the Ur-form to Being and Time. You will find many of the fundamental concepts that constitute the ecstatic horizon of temporality, particularly the temporal individuation of Dasein. This is an essential text both for new and seasoned readers of Heidegger.

There are a few moments in every serious reader's life where you simply have to sit back and accept the overwhelming magnitude and power of a great work of literature. For me, reading the latest translation of Dostoevsky's 'The Brothers Karamozov' proved to be once such occasion. This novel is so wonderful and profound that it almost transcends the expectations of art itself. For this novel is such a combination of forceful elements. It is a story of betrayal, of faith, of love, it is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, a love triangle, a story of loss and redemption, and all at the same time. Reading the Brother's K is like crawling through the crevices of a divinely inspired mind, a mind that had the creative force and faith in his own vision to craft this massive and great work. We are given unforgettable sequences such as the Grand Inquisitor, the prosecution, and the profound and deeply moving conclusion with Alyosha at the funeral. I found that Dostoevsky's characters gave off a a vivid luminosity that I have not experienced in other works of fiction, nor was I prepared to digest the deep and profound contradictions of the characters. This is a supreme achievement, and this translation will probably become the standard translation of what might be the greatest novel ever written.

A fascinating and extremely difficult collection of essays from philosopher-anthropologist-novelist-librarian Georges Bataille, whose work on literature brings us closer to literarity in terms of Freudian repression. Bataille covers a number of great writers in this collection (Bronte, Genet, Baudelaire, Sade), and attempts to unveil their complicity with evil and eros. For Bataille, writing is eros in the damned sense. He inherits the Platonic legacy which has condemned poetry as that which is always at a double removal from truth. Literature is not an innocent counter-gesture to the decay of civilization, it is itself embedded in thanatos. While Bataille's own prose here is extremely cryptic, and he often subordinates the author's to his own vision, this remains a peculiar and important text.

The collection of stories in this hefty volume are the mark of an artist more confident in his boots, but the same artist was increasingly unhappy and nervous about the world. The stories in this volume range from hilarious to grotesque, but they are mostly melancholic to dreary. The title segments involve the trendy 2nd person form and include some very fine writing, particularly the stories towards the end. What is most problematic about the late Foster Wallace is his apparently ambiguous relationship with postmodern affectation; he criticized it publicly and often alluded to the death of postmodern lit. Nevertheless, his prose in this collection is weighed down by various signs of the text, not a bad thing in itself, but Wallace's prose shines because of his naturalism, not his desire to complicate things with footnotes and trendy self-reflexive significations. A few of the stories here are truly mean spirited, I'm thinking in particular of the one about the Father's hatred of his son, which starts humorously enough but dissolves into a strangely angry little bit of dribble. What's best in this collection is Wallace's attunement to the new and subtle forms of selfish misogyny and the sad logic of the male ego. Perhaps this collection will resonate in feminist circles in the years to come.

An excellent monograph by the great metaphysician, Deleuze. This elaborate text attempts to demonstrate the expressivity of Spinoza's theory of immanence. Deleuze argues that the attributes of God express the essence of substance in its necessity and infinity. There is remarkable explication of finite modes in this text-Deleuze indicates that a mode's essence is a determinate degree of intensity, an "irreducible degree of power." I found this description helpful as the transition from infinite substance to finite modes has always been ambiguous for me. There is also some remarkable work on scholastic philosophy in this work-Deleuze incorporates some insightful comparisons with Scotus' theology in the section on numerical and real distinction. Perhaps most importantly, Deleuze is able to synthesize expressivity in Spinoza with Leibniz and to show how these two figures successfully launched an anti-Cartesian movement. Although this text has been criticized for allowing too much conceptual work to take place at the level of attribution, I found it to be a remarkably precise exegesis.

A fantastical nightmare of a book. Krasznahorkai has conjured an allegorical world of deceit, anarchy, and nascent fascism. This is the story of a small and deteriorating village in Hungary which is visited by a circus, a circus which purports to have the world's largest whale. Soon, the floodgates of chaos are opened, and Krasznahorkai discloses a world dominated by fear and violence. This is a novel of the political and literary spectacle-it is haunted by such classical tropes as the Leviathan, the nave and goodhearted simpleton, and terror of the crowd. The prose flows in extended and spiraling sentences reminiscent of Bernhard. It belongs to a brief list of the most impressive and serious of modern novels. Not too be missed.

Dostoyevsky's 'Notes from Underground,' is often called the first truly existential work of literature in the history of the west. Yet I think it is read today for the very seem reasons we always read Dostoevsky: for his command over intensity, his genuine and masterly sense of atmosphere, and his ability to psychologize those who are suffering. 'Notes from Underground,' is a true masterpiece in that it recreates the truth of genuine alienation and hatred. It laid the basis for all great works of existential art to follow, from the Stranger to Taxi Driver. Truly a dark gem of European literature.I found the Double, by contrast, to be rather tired and uninteresting. Perhaps it is because Kakfa and Freud has handled the theme of the doppelganger far more interestingly. I found it difficult to get into this one. It seems to me that the translation rang a little flat in comparison to Notes. Nevertheless, its an entertaining read, though one could never put it in the same class as great Dostoyevsky.

Stendhal's masterpiece 'The Red and the Black' is a perfectly woven portrait of the tragically rigid impositions of the church and society on man. Julien Sorel, the young and brilliant protagonist, falls in love first with a provincial wife, and later a Parisian wife of a Marquise. A wonderfully conceived depiction of the arbitrary forces which prevent the individual from happiness. Stendhal is a clunky stylist in comparison to Flaubert, but his characters may be more complex and interesting. 'The Red and the Black' often transcends the somewhat belabored arguments leveled against the church; his characters breathe with life and miraculously rich developments and contradictions. A true masterpiece of French realism.

Less stifling perhaps than 'Madame Bovary,' this fine novel portrays the immensely rich and entertaining world of Frederic, the young dilettante and aesthete who falls for the much older and unobtainable Madame Arnoux. Of course this novel is about the complexity of 19th century French society, about the rise of the bourgeoisie, about the revolution. But we read it for its complex and highly refined characters, and its crisp filmic realism. Like Tolstoy, Flaubert was a genius for capturing the smallest details with creativity and color. Who can forget Flaubert's clouds that look like the tips of ostrich feathers? This is a truly timeless masterpiece- a rare totality that combines bold storytelling with delicate grace.

Christopher Hitchens is consistently one of the most provocative (if at times arrogant) journalists in the world. This book is a collection of essays he's published in the Nation, Vanity Fair, and a number of other publications in the last few years. The first section, titled "Love," is purely literary criticism, and it's a fabulous demonstration of his elegance with the pen. He writes on a number of authors, Joyce, Proust, Orwell (of course), Borges, and a number of others. These essays are all pretty much first-rate; I may even come to take pleasure in his work about the arts more than his political analysis.The second section, titled "Poverty," contains essays on a number of political/sociological topics and figures such as Mother Teresa, Michael Moore, David Irving, and so forth. They vary in quality and levels of intellectual content, and are perhaps mostly mere polemics.The third section titled "War," is pure politics, and it begins with some fine essays about September 11, in which Hitchens provides his insight/feelings about that event. However, the final half of the section is more or less devoted to the Iraq war, which is where Hitchens very badly misses the mark. I don't object to his decidedly more "Hawkish" view of combating Islamic Jihad than the majority of the left, however I do object to his sweeping indictments of those on the left who do not hold the same point of view. Hitchens includes his embarrassing "Rejoinder to Noam Chomsky," wherein he stupidly responds to a rebuttal from Chomsky which he himself instigated by trying to argue that Chomsky was "rationalizing" Al Qida's crimes by comparing them to Clinton's bombing of a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum in 1998. Unfortunately the book does not include any of Chomsky's side of the debate so it appears as though Hitchens has rightly corrected Chomsky's error, however when you read all four of the articles written collectively it's clear that it was actually Chomsky who won the debate in a number of crucial respects; Hitchens refuses to admit that the bombing of the plant was a greater crime than 9/11 (which it was, approximately 10,000 people perished), which reveals is ethnocentrism. I don't think Hitchens still actually believes that the U.S. invasion of Iraq is truly humanitarian in nature; he is simply unwilling to admit his error. Despite his unevenness, Hitchens is a bright writer and worth reading, and "Love, Poverty, and War" is a potent collection.

A fascinating and grotesque Jim Ballard novel--it delves deep into the sexualization of violence, and the machinations of masochism with tremendous skill. Ballard places himself in this dark panorama, where he meets Vaughn, a man who gets off on car crashes. It's not easy to make it through Ballard's excruciatingly detailed passages that chronicle the a litany of sexually infused car crashes, events where the human body is disassembled and forever destroyed. Ballard's difficult novel asks us to consider the ways in which modern technology is distorting our relationships and our bodies--it is a relentless parable about the dark recesses of the man-machine matrix.

Ambitious statement from writer-director Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) about the ongoing clash between America's oil companies and the Middle East. Gaghan's film incorporates multiple story lines which he is only barely able to hold together in his portrait of what is now called "The Clash of Civilizations," but the film's incoherence may in fact be its strength, as Gaghan correctly refuses to provide simple answers about the oil companies, the US government, and Islamic fundamentalism. He forces the viewer to immerse himself in a chaotic realm, a realm of greed, betrayal, and conflicting values. George Clooney gives probably his most likeable performance to date as Bob Barnes, a CIA operative in Beirut who is captured and tortured, and then sold out by the government. Matt Damon is also good as a corporate analyst determined to make a splash off of a family tragedy with a Gulf prince, and Jeffrey Wright plays a corporate lawyer trying to aid the merger of two major oil companies. All of the acting is solid, and the footage of the Middle East is quite beautiful, yet it evokes the danger and uncertainty of the region. Syriana unfortunately suffers from largely poor and amateurish directing (Gaghan's first attempt at filming his script), employing I suppose a cinema verite mode of shaky cam, trying to recapture the feel of a documentary, but its only comes across as contrived and self-aggrandizing. Syriana is a triumph of content not form, and it is probably the most provocative and important Hollywood movie of the year.

George Steiner's criticism is occasionally lofty and hierarchical, but this volume is essentially an excellent comparison of the great Russian masters. Steiner places Tolstoy in the tradition of the classical epics, drawing frequent comparisons between Tolstoy and the best of Homer's epic poems. Dostoevsky, in contrast, is a true dramatist. His novels are often arranged in 'scenes' that are both Shakespearean and immersed in his contemporary Russian culture. For Steiner, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky will remain eternally great artists because of the inherent fusion of artistic brilliance with their obsessive preoccupation with the question of faith. He writes:"The novels of Dostoevsky mark successive stages of an inquiry into the existence of God. In them is elaborated a profound and radical philosophy of human action. Dostoevsky's heroes are intoxicated with ideas and consumed by the fires of language."With Tolstoy, Steiner sees an "inversion" of Dante's ascension into the Kingdom of Heaven. Tolstoy was gripped by the notion of heaven on earth, and his novels are always portraying the divine quality of simple-peasant living. Unlike much contemporary criticism, Steiner sees the greatness of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky not as great artists who overcame their philosophical doctrines. Rather, they were great artists whose vision of life was always enfolded in a dialectical tension between reality and philosophical theory.

"Comedy, like death and sex, is often awarded the prize of ineffability." So says James Wood, perhaps the finest living critic of literature. Just as he has prefaced, the art of comedy is often impossible to describe, and Wood falls victim to this perpetual difficulty. This collection of essays does not explain why some books are funny as much as it locates the brilliant moments of ironic and tragicomic paradox that accompany the finest works of literature. Although less focused than his 'How Fiction Works,' Wood is able to penetrate into the essence of an astonishing array of writers; he discusses the comic brilliance of 'Don Quixote' and the theological pull of 'The Brothers Karamozov' with equal depth and vibrancy. Perhaps he is most famous for his essay in this volume on "Hysterical Realism," the American novelist's proclivity towards the creation of a large and ridiculous vehicle of topical information. Wood sees writers like Pynchon, DeLillo, Rushdie, and Zadie Smith as prime culprits of this phenomenon. But not everyone gets skewered in this book- Bellow and Henry Green are lauded, as is Naipaul and Svevo. Like all excellent criticism, this book is both focused, principled, and provocative. All together an excellent work.

A film about a village terrorized by anonymous poison pen letters by Henri-Georges Clouzot made during the Nazi occupation of France. The film was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, the Catholic Church, and was banned after the Liberation. However, Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre recognized the film's greatness of Clouzot's anti-Gestapo subtext and helped him reestablish his career after the war. The film is in magnificent black and white, and it perfectly captures the paranoia of the war. Perhaps not as affecting as Diabolique, but quite potent none the less.

It is truly a relief to see this great artist, Paul Klee, express such doubt and self-deprecation with respect to his abilities. This collection of diaries is an excellent inner chronicle of the life and artistic development of the man. Klee was truly a great writer as well as painter, his descriptions of music sing with a kind of clarity few have matched. It is also particularly interesting to read his interactions with the other prominent painters of his period, such as Kandinsky. Although we do not get the same kind of depth of insight that you may find in the letters of Van Gogh, this is nevertheless a welcome view into the life of this brilliant creator of art.

Max Stirner was clearly among the most gifted of the young Hegelian's, and this mysterious text is was an obvious influence on the style and form of Nietzsche's thought. Stirner attempts to radically divest man of the 'spooks' of abstraction and ideology. His criticisms of religion morality remain crucial to our understanding of secular modernity. Stirner's morality is a morality of individual will, of force, with a clear residue in Nietzsche's Will to Power. This is a remarkable work in terms of its stylistic bite and radical transformation of Hegelian thought.

Craig Seligman's highly enjoyable dialectic study of critics/intellectuals Susan Sontag and Pauline Kael who enjoyed considerable attention during the 60's and 70's. Seligman elegantly contrasts the two writers, Sontag the intellectual and Kael the fervent populist. He's pretty straightforward in his preference for Kael as a film critic, although he does acknowledge that Sontag was far from a purely devoted film critic, as she also wrote novels and essays on photography, literature, politics, and pretty much anything else you can think of, therefore the comparison isn't exactly fair.Seligman argues that Sontag was ultimately the greater writer and intellectual, yet he feels that her writing was often too cool and detached, and of course humorless. Kael on the other hand, was a strident iconoclast, she insisted that movies were special in their fusion of pop culture with intelligent artistry, a principle that was made manifest by the likes of Altman, Godard, and DePalma. Yet Kael was no theorist, she spent a great deal of time and garnered much attention in her attack on the auteur theorists like Andrew Sarris and the New Wave critics, she insisted that film aesthetics could not be theorized (a sentiment I for one share), and that a film's quality was more often the product of many talents, not merely the director. Kael's biting criticism made her as many enemies as she had friends; she was attacked by Sarris, by Renata Adler, by Peter Bogdanovich, and later by Jonathan Rosenbaum for her views expressed in her book "Raising Kane." However, Kael was also loved and admired for her witty and personal essays which would leave an impact on David Denby and even influenced the filmmaking of Quentin Tarantino and a number of other prominent directors in recent years.Sontag never reviewed films she didn't like; preferring to analyze entire bodies of work in extended essays, often besides major intellectual writings on literature. Perhaps Seligman's book falters a bit in his extended defense of Kael; he defends her review of Shoah, and her writings on Orson Welles, but also provides a slightly absurd defense of her alleged homophobia, which he refutes essentially by indicating that he himself is a homosexual and was friends on Kael. This work is a solid comparison and contrast of the two writers, yet I was left feeling that he went a little too hard on Sontag for her difficulty and a little too easy on Kael for her unshakable refusal to reevaluate her opinions (she notoriously never viewed a movie twice).Seligman goes slightly overboard in his praise of Kael, writing that she "flourished with a consistency unmatched by any American writer since Henry James" (pg. 192). Please. I think Kael was a terrific writer and critic, but those who create works of art should never be equated with those who merely comment on them. Never the less, Seligman has rendered this critical study with very fine writing and an acute awareness of the two author's sensibilities; it makes you want to seek out their work immediately.

George Bataille's brief Sade-esque novella is a mordantly brilliant dip into the post-Nietzschen world modernity. The Story of the Eye is a pornographic disintegration of the Western ethical code. It is both magnificent and foul; a more daring and original work than his later philosophy/anthropology. A seminal piece of 20th century literature; although it was published well before the cultural abominations of our current nihilism, we are still not ready for this bleak and punkish work of literary debauchery.

This is one of Sebald's greatest books. A wildly discursive, wandering travelogue which allows Sebald's calm genius to radiate. Like a somnambulist, Sebald's narration takes us to places and topics of dim contours and oblique points of contact. We are brought to an investigation of Thomas Browne's skull, Rembrandt's masterful `The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp,' to descriptions of windmills on England's coast. At the heart of this great novel, lies Sebalds persisting attempt to deal with the question of Europe-his exultant presentations of colonialism and lost memories functions as a literary survey of a vast archaeological space. Sebald's talents will be missed, and he will perhaps be remembered best for this text and `Austerlitz,' both are unique works furnished of a lifetime of intellectual and aesthetic labor.

"This little book has no `hidden agenda.' It is offered in the most cheerful and open polemical spirit, as an attack on a crooked president and a corrupt and reactionary administration" (1).So says Christopher Hitchens in the preface. All though it may be the case that the book is cheerful and polemical it is also, I'm afraid to say, fairly clumsy and transparently superficial.Hitchens begins in the preface with the possibility that Clinton may have impregnated and African American woman during his term as Governor in Arkansas only to drop the implication based on the relevant DNA data. Hitchens has proven nothing here; he has merely introduced what we already know; Clinton's sexual infidelities and callous disregard for his family and other females along the way.-The majority of this slim book seeks to prove that Clinton in fact raped who was never given a fair hearing. Hitchens more or less accepts her testimony out of hand because he believes she is a good and honorable person and has not "agenda" in making up such dribble. Hmmm....Oh that's right, no one could ever gain anything from being associated in a sex scandal with the President (see Monica's story).-But there is a deeper problem with this complaint. The president's sexual behavior has nothing to do with the relevant political factors of his leadership and diplomacy. If Clinton is guilty of sexual assault then he should be tried as an ordinary citizen. But Hitchens' evidence is merely from second-hand testimony at best, and at worst it is derived from an awkward transcript of an interview with Al Gore in which he refused to comment.-The only worth while material in this book is Chapter 5, Clinton's War crimes. In it he discusses Clinton's bombing of the Al-Shifa plant in Khartoum in 1998, a clear war crime based on the evidence presented. I urge you to check this book out of the library, skip the sexual babble, and turn to this section as it is one of the view discussions on the topic aside from Noam Chomsky's comments in 9/11, which Hitchens would later blast him for as surprising as that sounds.

Perhaps the clearest exposition of Ficthe's 'Wissenschaftslehre.' An elaborate and logically tight outline of the act of self-consciousness. Fichte is attempting to identify the proposition 'I am I' as the absolute ground of all knowledge. There are amazing developments to critical philosophy in this dense material, though the status of the 'not-I' remains logically obscure. Fichte also takes on all his interlocutors in typically belligerent fashion; although the logical form of his argumentation is precise, he is unable to circumvent the ontological problems that Holderlin would later pose. Still this is more than a transitional footnote between Kant and Hegel-it is an extraordinary tour de force of thinking.

Paul Celan stands as the greatest of the post-war German poets, and this later collection represents a remarkable development in his stylistic "turn." Expertly translated by Pierre Jorris, Celan's acute play with words and sound resonate beautifully in this important volume. Celan's poems during this period have become increasingly brief and cryptic. For instance,"In-Heavened in plague-shrouds. At the disnightedplace.The eyelidreflexes duringthe luxuriantdreamlevelnull.This is poetry at its most difficult to translate, and Joris has done a remarkable job retaining the brilliant creativity of Celan's word-play while keeping the meaning intact. An outstanding book.

Balibar's collection-'Masses, Classes, Ideas,' is an excellent book about a wide range of political concerns, from Spinoza's formulation of human bondage to the problem of working class ideology in Marx and Engels. At the core of this work is an attempt to think through the problem of the absence of proletarian ideology. Balibar makes an interesting distinction between the working class and the masses-at a glance this appears to be a semantic gesture, but his conceptual developments overcome much of the teleology ascribed to the Marxist tradition. In particular, Balibar's work on the problem of historicity vs. history "in the strong sense," with regard to the development of Capital, is a much needed philosophical contribution to the rather hackneyed critiques of Marxist economics.

There is very little question that Rilke was the greatest German poet of the 20th century. The only question that remains is whether he was the greatest poet in any language. His brief, imaginative poems capture the essence of man in the modern period, alone, isolated, and without meaning.Edward Snow has captured the grace and subtle imagery of Rilke in this altogether outstanding collection of poems, in large part because he is a great poet in his own right. Readers of Rilke will surely be familiar with a number of poems in this bilingual collection, such as Autumn:"The leaves are falling, falling as if from far off,as if the heavens distant gardens withered;they fall with gestures that say "no."And in the nights the heavy earth fallsFrom all the stars into aloneness.We are falluing. This hand is falling.And look at the others: it is in them all.And yet there is One who holds this fallingWith infinite softness in his hands." (85).

This excellent edition of Paul Celan's major poetry (translated excellently by Michael Hamburger) provides the full scope of Celan's considerable genius. Included is the famous 'Death Fugue,' perhaps the most darkly beautiful and profound works of art about the Holocaust yet created. One is left with Celan's transitions; he began immersed in the syle of early 20th century German poets suck as Rilke, and later progressed in Breathturn and Threadsuns to reveal his capacity for highly creative and original linguistic play. The final poems are characterized by a deep morbidity and anguish; they are patently indicative of the poet's distrught spirits. He would later kill himself by drowning.Celan is now written about intensively by the philosophers Derrida and Lyotard, he is probably as important to them as Holderlin was to Heidegger. The editor has included a poem that Celan did not intend for publication; but you can understand why it was included, as it is a magnificent triumph of expressive sorrow over the loss of his parents during the war. Celan was a very great poet, readers are still trying to catch up with his complexity and deep artistic insight.

Love is a Dog From Hell captures Bukowski's considerable talent for capturing a mood and throwing the reader into his world. This is an excellent edition of modern poetry that perfectly captures the degenerated angst of the period. What is particularly striking here is Bukowski's acute awareness of the decay that surrounds him.

Thomas Mann's tragic rendering of the myth of Faust is an extraordinarily rich work of artistry and beauty. Adrian Leverkuhn is the precocious object of the narrator's affection, as he ascends into brilliance until a calculated bargain with the devil consigns his humanity to damnation. This is a brilliant allegory for Gerany's interior collapse as it degenerates into the Third Reich. There are moments in Doctor Faustus that are as strong as anything Mann has ever written, such as the remarkably detailed descriptions of 20th century musical composition. Truly an aesthetic experience of deep and complex proportions.

Durrell's final novel of his Alexandria Quartet returns the narrative back to Darley, the narrator of Justine, and the result is somewhat mixed. On the one hand, it is actually relieving that Durrell kicks the time forward in this sequel, instead of continuing to tighten and twist the narrative thread in another direction as he does in the previous three novels. However, returning the narrative voice back to Darley also has the effect of blinding our perspective instead of expanding it. Although it is interesting to return to the foundation, the result stifles Durrell's ability to engage with his characters in a truly different register. Although the Alexander Quartet is ultimately an excellent achievement, it also fails to live up to the intended scope of the project.

The Emigrants is a luminous collection of four partially fictive, partially true stories of German emigrants, each constructed with remarkable naturalism, by the late W.G. Sebald. This was the text that caught Europe's attention to the talents of Sebald, whose `prose narratives' shine with a dark and clear beauty. I'm particularly drawn to the story of the Uncle Ambrose, who befriended a high aristocrat and whose life was torn apart by heartbreak and tragedy. This text is interspersed with haunting photographs of people and places, and Sebald's fine attunement to his subjects demonstrates a rare combination of journalistic accuracy and lyricism. Although his subjects are tragic, Sebald's prose has the remarkable capacity to make life beautiful. The Emigrants is an astonishing work.

Noam Chomsky provides yet another sweeping political indictment of the United States, and this time he places the human species entire as potential victims of far-right elite power. This volume is extraordinarily broad and far-reaching. Chomsky discusses the Bush doctrine, Iraq, the Middle East, Globalization, the Cold War, and Nuclear proliferation to name justa few. His scholarship is praiseworthy, although he continues to overstretch himself. On the issue of the FRY, Chomsky continues to make false assumptions about the appropriate response to Serbian aggression. He is not an expert on this issue, and relies almost entirely on leftist publications, though his section on Israel-Palestine is evidence of his continued mastery of the topic.A few points to raise: Chomsky occasionally applies passing references to well established systems of thinking without quoting directly. For example, in discussing Clinton's unilateral bombing of the al-Shifa plant in Sudan in 1998, he refers to "the Hegelian doctrine that Africans are `mere things', whose lives have `no value.'" (pg. 207). No direct reference to Hegel is provided. Additionally Chomsky claims on page 100 that "the figure of $17 billion is the amount that Iraq has paid to people and companies [...]", without a citation. Chomsky also quotes Paul Wolfowitz to the fact that he was "praising the monstrous Suharto and supporting the brutal and corrupt Marcos" (pg. 114), without proper citation. One last scholarly issue, on page 233, Chomsky writes that "Washington had argued that `access to American bio-defense installations' might reveal military secrets" but he refers to the Judith Miller in the footnote (see #35 pg. 266), who later of course turned out to be a rubbish journalist.Never the less, Chomsky's belief that the forces of U.S. power are a threat to the survival of the human race are legitimate and worth taking seriously. His knowledge of politics is undeniably intimidating, yet I disagree with his incessant employment of the term "truism" (see esp. chapter 8 `Terrorism and Justice, pgs. 187- 216), there are no "truisms" in human affairs. No matter how scrupulously one arranges facts, facts are all they remain, not "truisms." Even the most reputable journalists, scholars, and human rights organizations are incapable of reporting the facts truthfully and correctly.

Sodom and Gomorrah makes it difficult for those who speak of Proust and attempt to reduce his grand work to mere flowery social observation. This is a bold and often disturbing installment of la recherch&eacute;, as Marcel recalls brutal homosexual sadomasochism among two of the principle characters, and has to deal with great loss and self-loathing.The narrator also returns us to the superficial world of the Verdurins, where Swann and Odette first made their interactions in Swann in Love.Marcel falls deeply in love with Albertine, but later discovers that she has been involved in homosexual relationships with two women, mirroring Swann's problems with Odette. There are remarkable passages on the nature of love in here: "But if something brings about a violent change in the position of that soul in relation to us, shows us that it is love with others and not with us, then by beating of our shattered heart we feel that it is not a few feet away from us but within us that the beloved creature was. Within us, in regions more or less superficial" (pg. 720)Sodom and Gomorrah is a deeply felt and complex development in Proust's extraordinarily full and beautiful search.

Phillip Dean is an American dropout from Yale, living in Paris with several friends. He meets a young woman named Anne-Marie and they immediatley fall in love. Salter's crisp and beautiful novella is forged in the tradition of the erotic novel-drawing on the rich themes of Henry Miller, Salter manages to recast the erotic in the clothes of minimalism. There are sublime moments here of rare beauty-Salter is a master of the minute particular. His descriptions of the quality of light, of landscape, and of city streets make this a profoundly lyrical, and visually stimulating text. A Sport and a Pastime is like a polished gem-a surface without depth, lapidary, and vividly felt.

Ferdinand de Saussure's work in linguistics was a conceptual breakthrough in that he broke with the comparative approach of traditional philology. Saussure argues against the study of mere semantics and phonology and locates the object of linguistic study as the structure of sign and signification. Although there is a failure to truly resolve the problem of the linguistic unit, Saussure still makes brilliant conceptual breakthroughs regarding the synchronic-diachronic distinction. Although much of the content of this course is no longer accepted my contemporary linguists, this text is still a landmark in that it would later prove to be crucially important to the achievements of structural anthropology, philosophy, and literary theory.

Documentary from Errol Morris, made after his cult classic Gates of Heaven, and running at a mere 55 minutes; it's a miniature portrait of lower-income rural life in Florida, tracing the activities of several inhabitants of the small town called Vernon. At times the dialogue is unintelligible, and the characters overly esoteric and dimwitted to garner enough attention, but the film has a few interesting scenes such as the breathtaking opening and a bizarre sermon delivered by an absent-minded religious zealot. A fair work on the whole, and not up to the caliber of his other work.

"Everyone who sees this film will be absolutely astonished," Jean-Luc Godard once said, "because this film is really the world in an hour and a half." Robert Bresson's 1966 masterpiece defies any conventional analysis, telling a story of sin and redemption by following Balthazar, a donkey, as he passes through the hands of a number of masters, including a peasant girl, a satanic delinquent, and a saintly fool. Perhaps the greatest and most revolutionary of Bresson's films, Balthazar is a difficult but transcendently rewarding experience, and the director is better able than in his previous work to put his philosophy of cinema into practice, that is is to say, the filming and meditation of that which is concealed. This is a gorgeous Criterion DVD with and excellent digital transfer, and it includes some fine supplemental material such as a French television program which includes commentary from such notables as Godard, Malle, and Bresson himself, speaking about the film. Never to be missed.

Tolstoy's brief novella 'Death of Ivan Ilyich' is one of the most compact and brilliant meditations on the meaning of death in literature. Tolstoy's breathtaking naturalism is truly miraculous. Ivan Ilyich is respectful administrator who is dying a painful death from a malignant tumor. Much as Kafka would later do in 'The Metamorphosis,' the dying man's suffering is nothing more than an annoyance for his friends and family. He spirals into a decline of intense suffering as he must stare into the meaning of his life and his inevitable end.Master and Man is also a wonderful novella, filled with stark, realistic depictions of the Russian peasantry, as a greedy landowner drags his obedient servant on a journey into a night blizzard to claim more property. As the pair become increasingly lost, they too must grapple with the possibility of their mortality.Pasternak has provided competent, though clunky translations of Tolstoy's original Russian.

The conclusion of Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy is a solemn and beautiful exploration on the erosion of the classical west. McCarthy's dialog is truly masterful and naturalistic-the swing of the interactions paints a remarkably vivid picture of friendship and trust. We are also fed typical McCarthy elements: horrendous violence, prostitution, dog fights, horses, and sun-baked malaise. I found that the guarded and impenetrable nature of the protagonist's stoicism made them even more intriguing, and the climactic sequence demonstrates an impressive ability to manipulate tension. Cities of the Plain is a very fine aesthetic accomplishment, even if the concluding sequence is overly self-conscious and postmodern.

As Susan Sontag once put it, Berlin Alexanderplatz is both the culmination and the origin of Fassbinder's immense career as a filmmaker. This seminal fifteen-plus hour television series, is the complete adaptation of D&ouml;blin's great novel. It is the story of Franz Biberkopf's hellish journey through Germany of the Weimar Republic. The saga begins with the protagonist's release from prison for the murder of a prostitute. He immediately renounces his brutishness and vows to live a life of honesty, but his surrounding world will simply not allow it. Quickly he is thrown into a world of crime where he becomes a pimp, criminal, drunkard, and lunatic. Fassbinder's combination of elements, e.g. the deliberate amplification of cinematic and theatrical artifice, as well as the deliberate manipulation of his mise en scene, combined with the extraordinary performances of his troupe make this one of the great film experiences. The extended 2-hour epilogue is a metaphysical circus of the first order-a brilliant meditation on the imminent barbarity of Nazism, and the utter failure of the human condition. This series will transform your expectations regarding the power of cinema. It is a sublime and explosive work of artistic transmission.

How this piece of art-house schlock ever came to be seriously respected is totally beyond me. Darren Aronofsky's big claim to fame (along with Requiem for a Dream), features Sean Gullette as an obsessed math genius determined to find a pattern in the inner-workings of the stock market, I guess so that he can get really rich. It's implausible that an individual as devoted to "ideas" as he claims to be would be so motivated to apply his talent to such a parasitic end, but hey, I guess audiences don't think brilliance is cool anymore unless you use it to hit the big time, which explains the obsession with the Las Vegas card counting geniuses from MIT. Aronofsky's style isn't quite as obnoxious as it would later be in Requiem for a Dream, but it's certainly obnoxious all the same, preferring to film his subject with grainy BW photography and lots of film-schoolish trick shots and fast cutting. Aronofsky ultimately fails to heighten the tension to the extent that he so clearly wishes, he strives for profundity, but Pi remains a simple (albeit moderately clever) thriller, nothing more. The scenes with Gullette and his mentor are well done and kept me interested despite the repetition.

This beautiful collection of Baudelaire includes Les Fleurs du mal as well as several prose poems. Richard Howard has produced an extraordinary translation of this singularly great poet. Baudelaire's place as a symbolist and one of the founding figures of modern poetry are beyond doubt. His woven attunement to the modern condition, with haunting observations of crowd psychology, drugs, prostitution, and disease are incomparable representations of urban life. Les Fleurs du mal rightly became a paradigmatic text which would provide the vision of a future poetic landscape for Rimbaud, Mallarme, and Valery. This collection is artfully arranged and impressively translated.

This text is essentially a concise summary of the work accomplished by Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason, in which the great thinker answers the following: 1)How is pure mathematics possible? 2) How is pure natural science possible? 3)How is metaphysics in general possible? 4) How is metaphysics as a science possible? These are of course the most crucial topics in all transcendental thought, and this volume is possibly the most successful microcosm of Kant's thought. However, for all real students of Kant, the Critique must be read in its entirety.

Peter Handke's slim memoir is necessarily sorrowful; it is about his mother's suicide. She was a survivor of the holocaust, and like many survivors, suffered from severe depression in the subsequent years. Handke's tone is cold, removed, and sepulchral. This is a vivid and moving text; it can not be easily categorized. It is non-fiction, but it is composed with the eye of a true artist.Not a read for everyone, but definitely an impressive effort. It is a testament to the ultimate destruction of Europe during WWII, glimpsed through the microcosm of a single individual.

This little volume is undeniably one of the most discussed works of ethical philosophy in the Western tradition. It stems from Kant's work on metaphysics, established in the Critique of Pure Reason in which Kant lays out the crucial principles of human understanding. This work, is a logical extension of Kant's noumenal-phenomenal division, in which man is given the choice of being an ethical legislator. For Kant, universality is the primary guideline to all ethical choice, in contradistinction to the utilitarian thinkers such as Mill and Bentham. There is nothing in this book that will sound peculiar to a new reader, as the ideas are so rational from a Western-Enlightenment point of view, they simply formulate what we have already been told. Never the less, this is essential reading for any real understanding of ethics and its development in relation to its rejection in the post-modern tradition. The translator, James Ellington, has done a fair job to Kant's work.

An extraordinary travelogue novel by the late Sebald, translated about 10 years after publication. In this debut work, Sebald weaves a thick complex of travel, memory, dream, and clarity with literary figures-Stendhal and Kafka are prominent pieces of this meta-literary tale. Sebald traces us back to his childhood in Bavaria through circuitous and often obscure wanderings through Europe. Part essay, part mystery, and part tragedy, Vertigo is a major aesthetic accomplishment and the mark of a talent that was ripening. Sadly, the fruits of his creative mind have been plucked from us all too prematurely.

The first volume of Robert Musil's magnificent opus `The Man Without Qualities,' is brilliant and intricate Prussian `a la recherche du temps perdu,' though without Proust's keen appreciation of the arts. This is an epic from the mind of a mathematician and a strict analytic philosopher who becomes ensconced in the aristocracy of Austro-Hungarian Empire in the years of its final disintegration leading up to the first World War. Ulrich is the man without qualities, the sharp minded observer and provocateur around whom the plot and characters revolve. We are given numerous outstanding characters, the graceful yet tormented Diotima, her lovers Arnheim and General Tuzzi, a mysterious maid named Rachel, her lover Solomon, and an intriguing serial killer on death row named Moosbrugger. Musil has brilliantly delineated the social layers of imperial Austria, and he throws us into a culture marked by petty megalomania and pseudo-profundities. Much of the novel is a funny satire of a culture on the decline; it is also a philosophical dialogue between diverging antitheses. Ulrich is a man looking for an age of spiritual purity free from the burden of `rationalism.' Like the novels of Thomas Mann, `The Man Without Qualities' is as much a book about ideas as it is a narrative in itself. This may leave many readers a bit cold. However, Musil's command over a canvas of such an immense scale has insured his place as one of the 20th centuries finest writers.

The Writing of the Disaster is an immensely difficult text- a text which deals with issues as totalizing as writing, the holocaust, and the text itself. Blanchot's style is naturally Nietzschean, drawing on the example of the aphorism, a fragmentary and disjointed fragment of thoughts, remarks, and of course contradictions. True, the use of explicit contradictions is a bit tiresome, and often difficult to comprehend, but Blanchot is playing with the impossibility of the writing of the disaster. The play of disaster and ruin is both destabilizing and ordering. Blanchot writes:"Energy, as destruction of things or as removal from among things, destroys and removes itself. Let us acknowledge this. However, this loss, as the disappearance of things-the disappearance, indeed, of the order of things-seeks in its turn to get into line, either by reinvesting itself as another thing, or by letting itself be spoken. Thereby, thanks to this discourse that makes a theme of it, it becomes considerable, it fits back into order and 'consecrates' itself. Only order gains from its loss" (90).The Writing of the Disaster is a thinking of and in pain. It is a deeply perplexing meditation on the impossibility of the text and the disaster of absence.

Hart Crane's brilliant poetry continues in the tradition of Eliot's 'The Wasteland,' in that he is interested in exploring the modern American landscape. Crane's poetry pulsates with his passion and tragedy. Frequent themes are his own homosexuality and the coldness of contemporary existence. His work is tremendous achievement in terms of its visual beauty and lyrical flow:"Often beneath the wave, wide from this ledgeThe dice of drowned men's bones he saw bequeathAn embassy. Their numbers as he watched,Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured.And wrecks passed without sound of bells,The calyx of death's bounty giving backA scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,The portent wound in corridors of shells."Hart Crane lived a tragically short life. Fortunately his remarkable work remains.

Burning the Days has been compared to Nabokov's remarkable memoir "Speak Memory" for its beauty and power of recollection. Salter's book, for all its strength, does not approach Nabokov's lyrical resonance. Yet at the same time this is a deeply satisfying literary memoir. Salter takes us through the story of a life colored by a radical break from piloting jets to the life of an author. Salter is truly a master at description: his scenes in the air are marvels of detail and precision. We come to see the emergence of a remarkable artist who develops a truly beautiful minimalist style. Salter's influences are Hemingway, Shaw, Miller, Colette, and perhaps Cocteau. I was particularly drawn to the life and influence of his friend and colleague, Robert Phelps, whose scholarly work on Colette seems to have burned a deep place in Salter's literary consciousness. I was disappointed to see that the book wanders-his forays into Hollywood are interesting at first, but they grow into an absurd taxonomy of celebrities and the obligatory gestures of self-congratulation that tend to accompany the film industry.

This short volume from Karl Jaspers is based on a series of televised lectures intended to seduce the common citizen into the domain of philosophy. Jaspers is an existentialist of the Heidegger-Sartre variety, though he adopts an undeniably Nietzschean tone in sections of this book, particularly in the latter pages where he briefly discusses Nietzsche's theory of the eternal recurrence of the same.The tone of this book is a whimsical, lucid, and the structure is brief and preliminary. Jaspers devotes much of his attention to political philosophy; he advocated political freedom as the ultimate source of authentic existenz for mankind. Additionally, he notes the importance of historical narrative, writing that, "were we to step out of history we would fall into nothingness" (20), unfortunately, he does not address the greatest thinkers of historiality, Nietzsche, and his colleague Heidegger.Jaspers also discusses the empirical and social sciences and the difficulty they pose for thinkers. He writes that, "the fundamental difficulty in the humanities can be expressed in a single sentence: They are concerned with man's freedom, but for science there is no freedom" (62). He adopts a distinctly Kantian conception of the boundaries of human knowledge, writing: "There is no such thing as detached, pure understanding" (63).His political philosophy is slightly nebulous, he seems to be some sort of classical liberal, of the Kant-Locke school, always arguing in favor of personal freedom, and against totalitarianism. He writes: "Either I hold political freedom to be the highest good in the world, or I am ready for totalitarianism" (65).Yet I found Jasper's dismissal of Marx and Freud to be the most fascinating section of the book. He writes that, "[Freud and Marx] were men of hate, who, like prophets, inspired faith" (69). Jasper's dismisses dialectical materialism and sexual libido as reductive pan-theories that fail to adequately explain the intricacies of social history and the human psyche.

Carl Schmitt was an early 20th century Jurist and legal scholar who developed a number of the most significant concepts of political theory. In Political Theology, Schmitt accomplishes two basic things: first, he develops the concept of Sovereignty which has come to dominate modern considerations of law and security. Namely, Schmitt articulates the Sovereign in terms of having the authority to decide on "the State of Exception." The State of Exception has come to be an extremely important concept among Critical Theorists today, particularly in the work of Agamben. Additionally, Schmitt argues that modern political concepts are ultimately "Secularized Theological Concepts," particularly the ultimate power of the Sovereign. Schmitt's politics is informed by the prioritization of security over freedom, and his Hobbesian world view permeates his specific interpretations of the legal and political World Situation in the difficult years of the Weimar period. Despite his nefarious participation in National Socialism, Schmitt's thought remains an important resource and reference point for contemporary political thought.

W.G. Sebald's posthumously published collection of essays and lectures is a provocative, albeit pedantic investigation of German post-war historiography. Sebald is critical of his compatriots' amnesia with regard to the destruction of German cities, as well as their own collective crimes. This volume has been criticized for failing to foreground the context in which the allies launched the bombing campaign-this critique is an unfair assessment of Sebald's position. His task in this text is to unearth the rubble of historical memory, and to expose the various ways in which German literature and prose have presented inadequate depictions of the trauma. Under scrutiny are Alfred Andersh (whom Sebald reviews negatively), Jean Amery, and Peter Weiss, among many others. Where this collection fails, in my estimation, is in Sebald's refusal to formulate a more theoretically rich argument with respect to the historicist issues at hand. As a consequence, the work reads as a somewhat restricted version of his luminous and introspective prose.

Gargoyles is a minor work by a great writer-it teems with the kind of obsessive intensity that makes his prose great, yet at the same time it isn't good at all. Thomas Bernhard sets his self-consciously Kafkaesque fantasy with the journeying of a father-physician and his son as they encounter a number of grotesque patients throughout the wooded terrain. The main section (or Gargoyle if you life), involves an extended monologue with a Prince who is losing his dynasty and his mind. The book revolves around these passages, and yet they are infuriatingly repetitive (not in the deepening way Bernhard normally employs). For all its oddities, this novel is a lesser achievement from a remarkable prose stylist.

Etienne Balibar's brief exegesis of Marxian theory is a lucid, but by no means dumbed-down account of the major problems and ideas in what is now called 'Marxism.' Balibar moves through the major concepts as a seasoned veteran of the ENS-his writing on ideology and history is particularly articulate. In addition, there are wonderful little snapshots of the major Marxian thinkers-from Gramsci to Althusser. Although many might object to the importation of 'ontology' in this interpretation, Balibar has still produced an invaluable resource.

The decisive tome of post-war fiction might very well be Gaddis' baroque epic, The Recognitions, an immensely powerful and complicated work of novelistic invention, stretches over 900 pages, and makes intellectual demands at every turn. In a way, The Recognitions is situated precisely on the cusp of modernism and post-modernism-the work modulates from strict realism to the fanciest flights of meta-reflexivity. The crux of the book is a powerful, and often tragic portrayal of fraudulence and forgery. Wyatt Gwyon is raised in a strict Calvinist setting, but his artistic talents lead him into a career as an art forger. Gaddis is at his most accomplished in synthesizing extended dramatic sequences with the barest of fragments of physical description. The combined duration of sequences of the cocktail party of the first book (over a hundred pages long), with saturated theological and mythological allusions makes for some extremely difficult reading. Moreover, characters move in and out of the narrative seamlessly, sometimes changing names (Wyatt becomes Stephen, Otto becomes Gordon), or they become insane and hallucinate. Countless modes of dissimulation and simulation color Gaddis' canvas-the total effect of which is truly destabilizing. At bottom, Gaddis has presented a view of modern capitalism in which the real is simulacral-the virtual has become more real than reality. Tragedy has finally, and irrevocably, become farce.

Rilke was one of the great imagists of the century. This collection contains magnificently translated poems by Edward Snow, who manages to capture the grace and power of Rilke's work. It is not altogether clear whether or not these poems were intended for publication, but it is a miracle that they were.Rilke was a poet of images and of feelings, he captured again and again the feeling of man the individual caught in the sublime beauty of the earth and the cosmos:"Earlier, how often, we'd remain, star in star,when from the constellation the freest,the announcing star, stepped forth and called.Star in star we marveled,He, the speaker of the star-sign,I, my life's companion star.And the night, how it granted usThe wide-awake accord" (235).An excellent bilingual edition on the whole and a must for any reader of modern poetry.

Heidegger's 1935 lecture course on metaphysics is a seminal work in this thinker's corpus. Introduced to English readers prior to Being and Time, this course is possibly the most accessible path to Heidegger's position in the history of philosophy. Tracing his `destruction' of the history of metaphysics, Heidegger brilliantly critiques the metaphysics of `presence' and offers a retrieval of a more primordial, originary determination of the meaning of Being. In particular, Heidegger's sections on the grammar of `being' as well as the `restriction of being' are astonishing works of thinking. The later includes a mordantly brilliant examination of the epistemological distortion of all ontology, stemming from Platonism and leading to a logic that has concealed the meaning of Being for the tradition. A masterful piece of thinking.

Ezra pound's cryptic, and often arrogant pamphlet about the principles of successful poetry is an interesting insight into the quality of the artist as a learned reader of classical poetry in the lyric form (primarily). Pound does not value any critics who have not produced works of literature themselves, and he promotes individual taste above all else. Never the less, he establishes a basic canon of great lyric poetry, including (above all else) Shakespeare, Homer, Chaucer, and Dante. Pound does not believe you can understand the nature of poetry without being able to read Latin, Greek, French, and Italian, but of course this guidebook is coming from a true fanatic. It is debatable whether or not this book creates more problems than it solves in the domain of interpreting and reading poetry, but it is clearly the aesthetic of a brilliant writer, and it is an essential facet of the modernist perspective.

Clever mockumentary by Zak Penn and featuring director-legend Werner Herzog on his quest to make a true documentary about the human need to believe in myth. It takes off as your standard "making of" fare, but then it twists into something entirely different as Zak Penn begins filming a super model and the ship encounters what appears to be the real loch ness monster. A number of the crew members are humorous and provide some good material, such as Michael Karnow as the Crypto-Zoologist who is convinced that nesse is the real deal from the get go, and Werner Herzog is in excellent form as he imitates his own obsessed megalomaniac self. The film definitely caught me off guard the first time I saw it, the fakery didn't become apparent until the plot became especially perpostrous as Penn pulls a gun on Werner, forcing him to film an idiotic model of nesse. However, it came across as a tad gimmicky the second time around.

Foucault's brilliant little text about the art of Rene Magritte is probably the closest to structuralism Foucault ever got. Looking at the two paintings of pipes by Magritte, Foucault interrogates the formal nature of representation itself. As a good semiotician, Foucault is incisive in separating the image from the text, the resemblance from the copy. This is a play of simulacta-although not as decisive as Barthes, Foucault is able to re-associate resemblance and affirmation. This curious little text also includes reflections on Klee, Kandinsky, and Apollinaire.

Despite the late philosopher's explicit request to not compose a biography of his life, James Miller has compiled a highly competent study of Foucault's life and thought. While not purporting to be a traditional biography, Miller frequently falls into the trap of imposing a cogent narrative onto the work of this great mind in a way that is not always convincing. We are provided with very fine material on Foucault's complex youth, as well as his various political engagements as an activist/academic, but I never got the sense that Miller had really penetrated the essence of Foucault's profoundly Nietzschean project. Perhaps it is because of his background in political science that Miller tends to fall back onto Foucault's politics and let the philosophy awkwardly sit there. We are given more description of Foucault's acid trip in Death Valley than the meaning of 'The Birth of the Clinic,' for instance. Still, this is a fairly reasonable approximation of Foucault's career and why it will remain a formidable presence in the humanities for ages to come.

Socrates' final plea to the court is a masterpiece of philosophical prose. Socrates' exhortation to examine yourself eternally resonates throughout the history of philosophy. It is actually difficult to employ the Apology in classrooms, though it often is. Unlike the Phaedo, the dialogue does not proceed with the dialectical beauty of Socrates' argumentation, but is rather a monologic distillation of the philosophical life. This is an extraordinary work of the Platonic spirit.

How can a society progress to a level of legitimate egalitarian communization without the creation of a hierarchical structure of leadership or vanguard? For anarchists, the answer often lies in anarcho-communism or anarcho-syndaclism. This text by Rudolph Rocker, is perhaps the definitive work on the latter theory. Anarcho-syndaclism eliminates the apparatus of the state as a means to socialism, whereas classical Marxist theory insists that the state will wither away once the proletarian has seized control of the means of production. Anarcho-syndaclism values the use of direct action as a means to control the forces of production, and the utility of unions and defederated workers councils as the proper structures for social planning. Rocker points to the syndaclists of the Spanish Revolution as the primary example of the theory in action, though there seem to be few cases in history of such socialization without centralized planning. Perhaps this mode of revolution is more legitimate and effective than classical Marxism or Marxist-Leninism, though I suspect that anarchism will always suffer from the fact of its inefficiency and inability to mobilize populations democratically. Nevertheless, Rocker's analysis and background history (aside from several cavalier uses of `human nature) is provocative alternative to state capitalism and state socialism.

Mallarme is rightly regarded as one of the father's of modernism and symbolism, and this beautiful collection is a testament to his radical artistry. Mallarme is notoriously difficult to translate, and while Henry Weinfield's translation often fails to account for Mallarme's ingenious wordplay (any translation would), he nevertheless manages to encapsulate the beauty of his language. Moreover, this collection is a painstaking recreation of Mallarme's textual specifications- Un coup de des is a beautiful painting/poem which transformed literature as we no it. There are also insightful commentaries on each poem from Weinfield, whose understanding and interpretative work is invaluable. An excellent collection.

Werner Herzog's second feature is set in Mexico and features a colony of dwarfs who revolt against their dictator. As Herzog later said, "it's a dark desperate sort of film," that he cobbled together with a cast of dwarfs and a stolen camera from a film school. The revolution features chaos and anarchy, dwarfs through bottles of wine at a moving truck, light things on fire, and kill farm animals all to the tune of serene African music. I have no clue what this film means, but it is undeniably intriguing, the kind of film one would expect from a doped-up tribe in the Amazon. See it for yourself.

Kertesz' brief novel is fascinating in its structure: Bee, a Holocaust survivor and writer, has killed himself from a morphine overdose, and his literary friends are left with the task of tending to his estate, which includes the liquidation of his work. Kertesz proceeds via a play within the novel, which develops the story foretelling the events instaurated by his death. The structure is elusive-it is an act of liquidation itself. Through this liquidation, Kertesz attempts to speak to the impossibility of extinguishing the memory of Auschwitz, as well as to signify the impossibility of recuperating the meaning of artistic creation before the ultimate event of human evil. A truly dark and mysteriously wonderful work.

Noam Chomsky's first political work is a first-rate collection of essays critiquing the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. Chomsky is more concerned here with the ideological defenses for the war than with the moral implications of the war itself, which are totally transparent at this late date. There are a wide variety of topics discussed in this broad volume, from the origins of the Pacific War to Arthur Schlesinger's liberal apologetics for U.S. imperialism. Chomsky's famous essay 'Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship' is a meandering account of the liberal intelligentsia's understanding of the Spanish Civil War. In it, Chomsky falls into the pitfalls of ultra-leftism, with low quality critiques of Bolshevism and Leninism. He relies on Rosa Luxemburg's fine criticisms of Lenin without examining Luxemburg's own political context in the German SDP, or her own explicit support for forming a revolutionary 'vanguard.' However, there are some fine passages in 'American Power and the New Mandarins,' such as 'The Logic of Withdrawal' or Chomsky's own personal reflections on the demonstrations at the Pentagon. This book will surely remain one of the better examinations of the criminal war in Vietnam for years to come.

Although Robert Altman is proficient in re-creating the scenery of Van Gogh's life through the eyes of the painter with striking color and a vaguely bohemian atmosphere, he still fails to present Van Gogh the man or the artist in with any genuine originality. He focuses on Van Gogh, the tormented saint-artist, who forges ahead on the canvas with a drive to present the "suffering" of humanity. However, Altman precludes Van Gogh's obvious manias, his periods of demented elation. It is impossible to believe that the Van Gogh presented here could have produced those vibrant wheat fields in Arles, or the Night Caf&eacute;. What remains in this fractured (though never incompetent biopic), is Tim Roth's virtuoso performance; he managed to literally crawl into the skin of Van Gogh, and the result may frighten you. However, his virtuosity always overshadows Paul Rhys' rather tepid presentation of his brother Theo, though there are other admirable performances in the film, such as Wladimir Yordanoff's amiable presentation of Gauguin. Altman seems to be commenting, rather uninterestingly, about the commercial dimension of artistry, and of the impossibility of true recognition of genius. This is a conventional portrait of the unrecognized genius, it is a tale told again and again. However, Altman's imagery is captivating (with the help of Storraro), the photography looks like vibrant haloes emitted by Van Gogh's paintings, though the musical score is dreadful and morbid. Still you much watch this one for Tim Roth's inspired performance if nothing else.

An extremely demanding late lecture from Martin Heidegger, which was greeted with enormous enthusiasm. This is a radical transformation of Heidegger's project of ontology, in which the question of Being has been freed from the (perceived) subjective/interiority of Dasein. This is the Heidegger of the event (Ereignis) of propriation, which concerns a more primordial happening of Being. This lecture among Heidegger's most difficult and mysterious texts, and it cannot be comprehended without thorough study of the early Heidegger. Also included is the End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking.

Jean Baudrillard's slim and largely unintelligible critical exegesis of Michel Foucault is a largely superficial and smug critique of the late thinker's work on the history of sexuality. Baudrillard begins his essay with a complement:"Foucault's writing is perfect in that the very movement of the text gives an admirable account of what it proposes: on one hand, a powerful generating spiral that is no longer despotic architecture but a filiation en abyme, coil and strophe without origin (without catastrophe, either), unfolding ever more widely and rigorously" (29)and so on and so forth. The basic thesis of Baudrillard's critique is that Foucault's "discourse is a mirror of the powers it describes." (30) He believes that Foucault's analysis is "no truer than any other," and that its appeal lies in its ability to seduce. He insists that Foucault's work is "too beautiful to be true" and that there is no essential difference between repression and the power dynamics which compel society to confess its sexual history. He maintains that Foucault's thesis is false because its link to Marxist theories of capital and reproduction are erroneous in that it was always the bourgeoisie that struggled with repression, not the proletariat. However, Baudrillard neglects to include any historical analysis, whereas Foucault's work is filled to the brim with it. You can judge which thinker is more responsible and serious for yourself.

Nabokov's brilliant and evocative prose style once again comes through in this elegant novel about a bewildered professor of Russian who is not dissimilar from the author. This novel is a fine combination of farcical humor and introspective reflection; it is both cool and finely polished as well as experimental. Although Nabokov occasionally falls into the pitfalls of the academic/farce genre, he is generally able to keep the book alive with curious uses of the narrator as character, as well as various digressions into other ancillary characters. A fine work, though it is not Nabokov at his best.

Hitchens' critical exegesis of the late mother Teresa is short, elegant, polemical, but undeniably circumscribed. His introduction is a weak precursor to an otherwise provocative examination wherein he `proves' that the footage the Catholic church employed as evidence of divine light was a fabrication. This doesn't seem particularly surprising.Underneath Teresa's efforts was not an effort to further the total quality of life of the world's poor, but rather, to further the ends of the church, which never seeks to fully emancipate the poor in any enlightened sense. Hitchens quotes Teresa to the fact that"There is always the danger that we may become only social workers or just do the work for the sake of work...It is a danger; if we forget to whom we are doing it. Our works are only an expression of our love for Christ" (pg. 31). Theresa's work was a `fundamentalist religious campaign' but it was also a campaign that sought support from well known fascist slime.Then we find Teresa's fierce propagation of the church's pro-life stance. She says, "today, abortion is the worst evil, and the greatest enemy of peace" (57). Pro-Life Catholic dogma may also prove to be the main cause of the aids epidemic in the southern hemisphere today.Turning to page 67, one finds one of the few slices of documentary evidence Hitchens manages to provide, an order from Teresa seeking clemency from Charles Keating, wherein it is shown that she received large sums of money from a well known fraud and swindler. Is this immoral? Or is it an inescapable facet of organizing public institutions? Hitchens believes the former. You can decide for yourself.On Teresa's involvement in Guatemala during the contras aggressive war against the leftist Sandinistas (which she consistently blasted), she stated, "everything was peaceful in the parts of the country we visited. I do not get involved in that sort of politics" (pg. 93). Hitchens is right to point out false sanctity, but like his trial of Henry Kissinger, he tends to microscope the individual's crimes and failings while neglecting to address the larger structural and institutional features that allow that precipitates the behavior and allows it to flourish.

Richard Tull is a failed intellectual novelist deep in the trenches of middle-aged disillusionment. His friend, Gwyn Barry, is a mediocre novelist rising in the marketplace. Richard has decided, that the only way to mitigate his pain is to f*ck Gwyn up.Martin Amis has concocted a wickedly funny satire; it's a satire of capitalism in the 1990's, of the fakery of the artistic sphere and of narcissism.The book is kind of pitiful at times, and Richards broodings become rather tedious, and Amis has included far too much description of the character Scozzy (I wish there was more between Richard and his wife, those parts were good) but, never the less, `The Information' is a fairly successful novel. And ironically, it sent Amis into the world of literary celebrity (the world which he clearly despises) upon its publication and changed his career forever. Not great, but probably more interesting than Kingsley's fiction.

Blue of Noon is a neglected work in Bataille's corpus, but it is a great work. Set in Paris in the 1930s, the tormented narrator struggles to balance his role as a normal husband with his pathological impulses. He is drawn to necrophilia, to prostitution, to death. Dirty and Xenie are the major women in his life-objects of repulsive/attractive filth and decay. Bataille also takes us to Spain for the budding revolution; there are extraordinary snapshots of the emergence of Fascism in the latter pages of the novel. But is this a political work? Is it even possible to say? Surely Bataille thought that pathology was political/sociological. Yet one should read this as an aestheticization of transgression first-all attempts to frame the work into social categories will prove to be inadequate.

Isaiah Berlin's brief biography of the life and work of Marx is an all-together excellent portrait of one of the truly fertile minds of modernity. With elegant prose and a fine attention to historical detail, Berlin manages to construct a living presentation of the life of work in terms of his intellectual project and its relationship to his interlocutors. Berlin discusses the significance of Engels, Stirner and the Young Hegelians, Bakunin, Proudon, and all the usual suspects to give an accurate sense of Marx's intellectual environment. Yet this book does not get waterlogged in endless details as is the custom with biography; Berlin has managed to give an accurate assessment of the life and work of this immense genius without losing himself in the details. Although obviously inflected by Berlin's own liberalism, this portrait remains an excellent place to reach an approximation of Marx' life and his devotion to the project of changing the world.

This brilliant collection distills the miraculous solidity of Rilke's finest poetry, from his work on panthers to Apollonian statues his art sings with mysterious divinity and sadness. Taking his cue from Rodin, Rilke forged a poesy of nature and spirit, rich with stylistic accomplishment. Snow's translations are remarkable transformations of German; without submitting to the logic of vulgar populism, Snow has breathed life into the text, and his words wring true in English. This is an excellent collection of the finest German poet of the 20th century.

Granted, Nehamas' reading of Nietzsche's corpus as a literary 'text,' yields a number of interesting results, particularly in his analysis of Nietzsche's conception of 'How to Become What One Is.' But I wonder just how interested in literature Nehamas really is here-he spends the bulk of this volume discussing Nietzsche's perspectivism (which is an unusually elegant and clear explication) and his distrust of traditional conceptualizations of truth. Yet he wavers on key positions, such as the eternal return and will to power. Nehamas fails to push the perspective of Zarathustra as a literary creation far enough. Nietzsche's positive reevaluation of all values lies in the possibility of artistic creation as an overcoming of nihilism. His analysis degenerates into uninteresting snobbery in the section on Beyond Good and Evil where he describes Nietzsche as a 'monstrosity,' and 'vague.' This is simply the inability on Nehamas' part to unify the thoughts of a thinker whose work so consistently resists unification.

This round table discussion, delivered at Villanova in 1994, is one of the clearest and most engaging introductions to the thought of Jacques Derrida. Surrounded by faculty, and speaking in excellent English, Derrida fields a wide range of questions regarding the nature of deconstruction and how it has been misunderstood so frequently and irresponsibly by his critics. John Caputo has also provided an outstanding collection of critical commentaries which address in greater detail the issues which were brought up at the round table. Although Caputo is a little polemical at times, he does an excellent job refuting the mediocre criticisms leveled at Derrida from the likes of Sokal, Quine, Gutmann and others who are quick to condemn without truly reading the work of Derrida. This is an exceptionally clear and engaging collection of essays for any reader looking for a safe entryway to the complexity of Derrida's massive corpus.

Most of the material in this correspondence between Martin Heidegger and Hannah Arendt shouldn't come as much of a surprise to most students who are familiar with these great thinkers's respective work. Although, there is surprisingly little discussion of the unfortunate political situation of Heidegger, I suppose the de-Nazification trials exhausted the subject. Still, this is a nice collection of letters; what unfolds are the painful vicissitudes of their affair, and the almost complete destruction of their (and their families) lives on account of WWII. What is a pleasure to read here, however, is Heidegger's casual remarks on his serious philosophical projects, it provides an excellent window into his craft. One reaction, though it hardly comes as a surprise: Heidegger was a terrible poet. For example:"SONATA SONANS"What rang rings.It sinksInto lament's unknown ware'sSings into what no one dares,What's formed from the wreath,Takes place,Gentle's love and woeInto the Same.Etc. Etc.Perhaps the most problematic aspect of this collection is (at least for me), that it turns the reader into a creepy voyeur who peers into these personal love letters. Still, there is enough scholarly material contained within for scholars and students to make it a worthwhile collection.

I have to admit that my understanding of this philosophical text by Wittgenstein minimal at best. The book is small and is broken down into short, declarative investigations of the boundaries of human knowledge, presented in terms of logic, and often symbolic language. The mathematical formulas and explanations are extremely complicated and I'm sure more background in this area is needed to really grasp the material. However, there is enough in here that's both cogent and profoundly imaginative to keep casual readers hooked (if they're patient). This is considered one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20th century despite Wittgenstein's closed-door conclusions. I'll leave you with the most imortant line in the book; a finding of genius, or a pretentious cop-out? You decide:"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."

Canetti's incomparable masterpiece is an inferno of dialectical confrontations-confrontations between the life of the mind and the slow, degenerate ruin of the modern world. Canetti's vision is at once hellish and comic. Kien, a brilliant Sinologist and lover of books lives only for his library and his work until he marries his crass house-keeper, a woman who systematically destroys him. Kien is thrown into a macabre underworld of hunchbacks and prostitutes in this uncanny metaphysical circus. Canetti's vision accounts for the strangely satanic character of genius, and yet is able to see the rise of the brutish fascism that was to envelop Europe. This is high modernism at its peak.

This work is a much clearer exposition of Fichte's 'Wissenschaftslehre,' when one compares it to his later work. Although overlooked today, Fichte's Idealism is a truly significant development in post-critical philosophy. Fichte attacks the Kantian opposition between the critical and dogmatic in his disavowal of the thing in itself. Fichte wants to locate the absolute in the structure of self-consciousness itself, in the I am I formulation. This work should be read as more than a mere stepping stone to Hegel; it also is the source of considerable developments in German Romanticism, from Schelling, Holderlin and Novalis. Though flawed, the 'Wissenschaftslehre' is indispensable to the history of epistemology.

Peter Singer has long since proven himself to be one of the most important and influential ethical utilitarian philosophers of the 20th century. However, when Singer steps into the realm of politics things get a little murky; this book, "One World" is an analysis of Globalization and its effects, and it's a less than perfect work. For instance, Singer provides thorough background information on the harmful effects industry is having on the environment in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, and then moves into a section on politics and international law. Now the problem with his research is that the majority of the sources he cites in the footnotes are outdated web pages that can no longer be accessed, hardly something you want to ground your beliefs about globalization in.The exception to this is the source for footnote 33 on page 45 of the "One Atmosphere" chapter, which links to an excellent website detailing the U.S.'s steadily increasing rate of Carbon Dioxide Emissions which confirm his claims. Unfortunately, a number of these online resources Singer cites cannot be reached, I'm referring now to footnotes 5 and 6 of chapter 1 which details U.N. reports, footnotes 2 and 4 of chapter 2 are also not available, as are footnotes 10, 11, 20, 35, 37, and 59 of chapter 3, "One Economy," and these are just a sampling of the sources I checked. The majority of this is highly unreliable data, and it's not just the websites, Singer relies very heavily on Thomas Friedman's biased book "The Lexus and the Olive Tree," see footnotes 15,16, and 17 of chapter 1. Clearly there's a dilemma for people who are serious about this topic after reading through Singer's notes.Hell, maybe every single source cited in this book is correct, but I couldn't verify a great deal of it. But that's just one complaint I have with the book; in addition, Singer indicates to me that he just isn't an expert on politics in any sense of the word. For instance, when discussing international law and humanitarian intervention initiatives, Singer simply confuses political "authority" with political "legitimacy" outright. Not only that, but he proceeds to discuss genocide and crimes against humanity with regard to Democratic political systems without offering any kind of working definition of democracy. I wonder if he realizes that the so-called democracy in the U.S. contributed to the genocide in East Timor. Anyway, as I've said before Singer is an excellent ethical philosopher, but his politics is pretty amateurish.Perhaps my biggest complaint with the book is Singer's failure to analyze the connection between the rise of globalization with the rise of poverty, pollution, war, etc. He simply describes globalization as a phenomenon, detailing the facets of the WTO and so on, without offering much of a thoughtful connection between that phenomenon with the other ethical concerns of the book. To put it simply, Singer ultimately cops out in offering a normative judgment on globalization as a whole, preferring instead to move on to other issues like international law and nationalism, issues that for me at least are intimately related to globalization.The book does have some good insights to offer; the final section where Singer analyzes the U.S.'s frugal contributions to Third World countries is particularly striking, and he offers some insightful solutions to solving problems of global poverty and suffering. Additionally, he offers some interesting criticisms of John Rawls' work in political justice and his failure to address issues of justice between differing societies. Yet, I'm afraid this book has too many problems to recommend or rely on, but I'm sure there are many superior books on globalization for readers who are willing to look.

Trakl's poetry marks a turning point in the history of Germanic art, a turning point which attempts to think and speak the impenetrable. This brilliant collection gathers the work of this illusive and dark artist-a poet obsessed with death, decay, and the obscure. Like all great art, Trakl's work resists easy interpretation, it constitutes a radical break with the acceptable boundaries of form and content. A tour de force of artistic bravery. Alexander Stillmark has provided faithful and artfully rendered translations of the original.

This collection of critical essays represents Paul de Man's less boldly 'deconstructionist' approaches to literature and philosophy-they bear the mark of a deep and thoughtful reader who is not afraid to run against the grain of academic fashions. De Man is particularly strong on extricating the ambiguous relationship of the literary and the philosophical. His reading of Sartre's mode of existentialism is indicative of his rigorous ability to parcel out the confusion arising from the term. For instance, in 'Heidegger Reconsidered,' de Man writes"For nothing is more remote from Heidegger than this confusion between the pathos of direct experience and the knowing of this experience-a confusion that, ironically, has become associated with so-called existentialist thought, mainly because of Sartre's famous and unfortunate phrase about the precedence of existence over essences. One could rather describe 'Being and Time' as the most thoroughgoing attempt to cleanse our thought from that confusion not only in language, but in the philosophical project as a whole...Heidegger does not in any way plunge one into the undifferentiated and opaque mass of direct actions, feelings, or emotions; his entire enterprise strives in the opposite direction."This is a rich and finely erudite collection with an impressive range of literary and philosophical topics. De Man writes on Mallarme, Borges, Keats, Gide, and many others. The scholarly introduction to his life and works by Lindsay Waters is also excellent.

Virgil's masterful epic poem is the story of descent and victory, of ruin and fate. It is the retrospective commemoration of the founding of the Roman Empire. Aeneas is our hero. After the fall of Troy, Aeneas is summoned to reconstruct Troy in Italy, but Juno the Goddess is determined to impede and ultimately overturn his fate. This epic is infused with a sense of interiorized furor, unlike anything we see in Homer. It is an extraordinary presentation of the conflict between the fortunes of fate and the tremors of the heart. Blood drenched, Aeneas and his band will found Rome-yet what it means to be a Roman is doomed to incompleteness. The logic of "pax romana" will never be satisfied if the slaying of the vanquished will never ultimately release you from the fury that enslaves your soul. This is a transcendent work-a temple of violence and passion. Fitzgerald's translation is perhaps not the most poetically graceful, but it reads very nicely and is quite close to the literal meaning. And yet I'm told that Fagles and Lombardo are better.

This little Lars von Trier film proceeds with a peculiar blend of Bergmanesque tragedy and relaxed sense of self-reflexivity. Two screenwriters lose their script and switch gears to a story about the release of the bubonic plague in Medieval Europe. In the process, the writers appear to unleash a real plague as the film switches from scenes of artistic creation to their own modern predicament. This is minor von Trier-with the exception of some darkly antagonistic scenes in dungeon-like rooms. The ending is obnoxiously sophomoric, though some will love it.

Moses Herzog is a failed academic, twice divorced, and facing the impenetrable wall of his own misdoings. He writes letters obsessively, to both living and dead beings. The late Saul Bellow is competent in his mosaic of action and letter-stream of consciousness, though the supplemental characters never manage to rise above the clutter of Herzog's internal voice. A fine portrait of Jewish cultural life in Chicago emerges as Bellow interweaves a sophisticated portrait of academic life in the mid-60's. Still, I couldn't remove the impression that Bellow's writing is entirely too clean, too composed, and lacks the courage to leap off the perimeters of his canvas.

Sarraute's difficult novel is a testament to the radicality of the nouveau roman authors. Reading this text is like driving without a steering wheel: we are given almost nothing to hold onto as the prose proceeds through varying points of consciousness. It is (ostensibly) the story of a young Parisian couple after WWII who are trying to obtain their aunt's beautiful flat. The aunt--a terribly difficult woman is first willing to give it to them but then retracts her offer. Situations of unbearable banality abound as Sarraute weaves a dense narrative with the furnishings of an apartment as the focal point--and yet this focal point is easily eclipsed as we move into deeper and deeper levels of mystery. The Planetarium is not enjoyable in any traditional sense, but deeply intriguing.

Slavoj Zizek's dense tome is a wandering and unfocused investigation of what he refers to as a 'parallax,' "the apparent displacement of an object (the shift of its position against a background), caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight." Zizek examines numerous instances of the 'parallax gap' in multiple spheres of social life, from the political to the pop. There are brilliant explanations of Hegelian dialectics here, but Zizek's Lacanian lens is both interesting and restricting. He is ultimately unable to free himself from the baroque terminology of the late analyst and as a result his interpretation suffers from verbose terminology and awkward shifts of perspective. This is a rich book with plenty of insightful ideas, but it fails from sloppiness and lack of discipline.

Bizarre and funny short documentary shot by Les Blank, featuring director/legend Werner Herzog who promised colleague and friend Errol Morris that when the latter completed and released his film about pet cemeteries (Gates of Heaven), he would eat his shoes. Herzog fulfils his end of the bargain at the premiere of Morris' film, and he proceeds to rant about waging war on television and commercials, and encourages film students to steal in order to get their films made. The film is a small and amusing portrait of a devoted (if a bit fanatical) auteur staying true to his grandiose declarations.

Hunger is a remarkable first-person account of a poor writer in Oslo who is starving. Knut Hamsun was able to paint a vivid and breathtaking portrait of the psychology of nihilism and self-contempt in this novel, a work for which he will always be remembered. It was obvious to me upon reading this that Hunger is extremely influential, it seemed to have a lasting impact on the more existential writing of the early 20th century, most clearly with Franz Kafka's story, "The Hunger Artist." For all its disturbing strangeness, Hunger is amazingly a work of fiction that is also wittily funny. It begins and ends quite arbitrarily, and is filled with wickedly funny anecdotes, such as the protagonist's inexplicable following of a young girl, for whom he repeats, "you've dropped your book." I think Hunger will always be studied because it's extremely hard to understand. The book is filled with contradictions as exemplified by the addition's conflicting forward and afterward. In the forward, the writer argues that the protagonist's plight is suicidal that his hunger is avoidable and his behavior is deliberately self-destructive, whereas the afterward writer maintains that his hunger is merely a product of poverty and social injustice. In any case, the book is extremely compelling and vivid. Unfortunately, Knut Hamsun is a man whose life is not at all beyond reproach; he did eventually support the Nazi Party and ended up sending his Nobel Prize to Goebbels, which is utterly deplorable, although many have maintained that Hamsun was fully insane at the time. Never the less, despite Hamsun's character and political dumbness, Hunger is an excellent book and should be read by all lovers of literature.

Bataille's philosophical/anthropological examination into taboo's and transgressions is a fine work of theoretical inquiry, though it ultimately fails to say anything that Freud has not already said in 'Totem and Taboo' as well as 'Civilization and its Discontents.' Although Bataille's familiarity with ethnographic records is stronger than Freud's, his capacity to extrapolate theories from them is far weaker. I believe that Bataille does little in the way of gathering a unified theory of the taboo and transgression, nor does he provide any genuine insight into the connection between human sensuality and death. However, I found his analysis of Sade and the final commentary on sanctity to be quite interesting.

Adorno's Minima Moralia is one of his characteristic texts-it is an extraordinary study of the contradictions of modern society. While Adorno's argument does not turn exclusively on a criticism of capitalism (whereas Marcuse's did), his work is clearly indebted to a mode of dialectical argumentation which exposes the thetic movements of our modern cultural situation. Adorno is a marvelous stylist-this text moves in Nietzschean manner through a dense web of cultural and political lineages and points to their corresponding symptoms. This is one of the singularly accomplished texts regarding the state of alienated subjectivity from the Continental tradition. A limitless and indispensable resource.

George Clooney's black and white feature is about journalist Edward R. Murrow's effort to challenge the methods of Senator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950's when he actively investigated and indicted members of the entertainment, media, and military industries for communist sympathies and Soviet membership. The film is decent and well acted, David Strathairn plays a very convincing Murrow, and Clooney's directing is competent. However, the film takes an entirely too simplistic moral view of its subject, it fails to acknowledge the paranoia of the period and has the benefit of hindsight. Additionally, the film makes CBS and Murrow's efforts more heroic then they actually were, Senator McCarthy certainly didn't have as much power as the entire CBS Corporation, and the journalists who brought him down weren't really risking as much as the film implies. Furthermore, McCarthy was not attacked until he investigated individuals with real power like high ranking officials in the military; the film fails to make this clear. An average work on the whole, but worth seeing none the less.

This little book includes some of Christopher Hitchens' best investigative reporting. He puts former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on trial (at last), and indicts him for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Chile, Cyprus, East Timor, for an attempted assassination of Greek dissident journalist. The book is slim, but fairly detailed, and while it focuses on Kissinger (deservingly), the implicit thesis of the book is the flaw of international legal standards, that is to say, when a statesman commits crimes and is powerless he is hanged, if the statesman is powerful he is worshipped. Perhaps a little light on footnotes, Hitchens prefers to provide internal citations, but I think book's conclusions are actually conservative; Hitchens often cites the most conservative number of dead civilians to avoid legal pressure, i.e. 100,000 dead in East Timor (most studies cite 200,000 in total), one can be sure that the figures are not politicized, Kissinger's legal team would have brought Hitchens down in two seconds if there had been number inflation.

Marlon Brando's memoir reads like a breezy conversation thanks to the assistant (if not outright ghostwriter) Robert Lindsay, who was able to compile this material after who knows how much dribble. Brando was undeniably one of the greats, a brilliant craftsman and innovator on the stage and screen. After his cult of personality had been established with `Streetcar,' `On the Waterfront,' and `The Wild One,' Brando drifted to smaller projects, which Hollywood was quick to dismiss. However, during this time Brando performed in Burn! by Pontecervo, which he cites as his greatest performance. I would argue `Last Tango in Paris,' wherein Bertolucci really let Brando's improvisational talent flourish. This memoir is undeniably fluff; he even admits he agreed to do it for the money alone, but it's entertaining fluff. You get to learn about his peculiar politics which include: a visceral support for Zionism, support for the civil rights movement, opposition to the war in Vietnam, and extreme activism to support Native Americans. Brando was a devoted and complex individual. He admits that he enjoyed having affairs, that he often took projects for money, that he was often depressed, lonely, and hot-tempered. What also emerges here is a portrait of an artist trying to gain independence in an inauthentic industry; perhaps he was one of the few who refused to let it ever beat him.

This brief collection of Will Self's journalism is mixed--essays range from brilliant to banal. Self has emerges has one of Britain's most interesting writers over the course of the last two decades, and this early collection is a little window into his immense gifts. I was particularly drawn to the piece about feminist Andrea Dworkin, in whom Will sees an underappreciated political voice. And yes, there is plenty to hear about drugs, Martin Amis, and his parents, each of which is probably better served in small doses.

This brief collection of Ranciere's corpus gives the reader a picture of his complex reworking of the logic of historical representations of art and politics. Ranciere is known for his reformulation of the great transitions in the history of art, to "regimes of historicity." In particular, his reflections on the "aesthetic regime" of art are truly incisive reconfigurations of politics-aesthetics in terms of what he calls the "distribution of the sensible." Additionally, the translator has provided a helpful appendix explaining Ranciere's terminology. This text is a very good place to start for readers who are new to his work.

William Gass proves his remarkable erudition in this expansive collection of reviews and reflections. Although this book is a bit unfocused at time-particularly in Gass' meandering discussion of the history of the spectacle-there are still extraordinary essays on Rilke, Gaddis, Rodin, as well are more abstract commentaries on the nature of evil and sacred literature. Mr. Gass' personal temple of texts is an interesting look at his aesthetic and philosophic influences, without the oracular and hierarchical tone of critics like Harold Bloom. Still, this collection is a bit rich at times-like biting into an overly sweet, strawberry chocolate. However, Gass nevertheless proves his intimidating knowledge of literature and culture without ever losing touch with his own creative commitments.

Sebald's prose has the remarkable capacity to draw you in to dark and tormented subjects, but the total production of his narrative-with his scientific attunement to detail-also engenders a sense of wonder and enjoyment with regard to the bare facts of existence. This quasi-memoir is the story of Austerlitz, whose family and legacy has been displaced and obliterated in the Shoah. This is a magnificent, and mature approach to the subject of Holocaust remembrance-as Sebald has said, the subject can only be approached `obliquely.' This little book, filled with haunting and mysterious photographs, is a kind of monograph of glimmering prose, at once distant and omnipresent. An incomparable masterpiece and one of the finest works to emerge in recent years.

For a reader of Western philosophy, this tome comes as a wonderful and exhilarating shock. al-Farabi is at heart, a NeoPlatonist with regard to politics, an Aristotelian with regard to logic, and a Spinozan with regard to metaphysics. His command of the tradition is apparent from this immensely brilliant and comprehensive work of political theory. Beginning with an account of the First Cause, and the beginnings of becoming, al-Farabi lucidly sketches the existence of all the immaterial and material bodies of the universe, until we reach the art of politics and governing. This is a wonderful work of philosophy, even if certain sections (in particular the section on the organs of the body) are a bit tedious and outdated. A supreme part of the Islamic canon.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure at the time of the book's publication during the 1970's this was an invaluable text when little was known of the genocide in Cambodia. The author, Francois Ponchaud offers a detailed account of the Khmer Rouge takeover and subsequent political experiment that included horrific violence and totalitarian levels of state control. Ponchaud's book is mostly comprised of Cambodian refugee accounts recorded in Thailand once they escaped from the Khemer Rouge's brutal grasp. The accounts are extremely detailed and tragic, and I'm sure they were extremely informative at the time. However, Ponchaud's scholarship is not beyond reproach. For instance, he frequently tosses around numbers of refugees and Khemer militants, and there's little that can be verified from the refugee accounts, many of which are recorded second-hand. I'm afraid the vast majority of the sources that Ponchaud cites are just references to Cambodian radio broadcasts that cannot today be confirmed. Additionally, the entire last section of the book is given over to the background history of Pol Pot and his legions, tracing the origins of socialist thought in them, and bogusly arguing that the Khemer Rouge's ideology was the logical conclusion of all socialist thought. Unfortunately, there is barely a single source cited in this entire section! It really cannot be relied on. I'm not saying that the contents of this book aren't correct or that they're not worth reading, I'm just saying there is very little that can be verified. Still I'm sure the book was quite an eye-opener at the time, but you should really check out the more serious scholarship on this subject that was printed after the atrocities for they are far more professional and are backed up with a wealth of resources. I recommend to all readers interested in the topic to read the articles produced by Yale University's Cambodian Genocide Program, a thorough study of the history and results of the Khemer Rouge's disastrous and barbaric reign.

Althusser became one of the most respected and interesting philosophers of Marxism in France during the 1950's and 60's, which is no small accomplishment considering the fact that practically every intellectual was writing about Marx at the same time. In all honesty, I find his work to be of rather mixed value. I have found his structuralist interpretations of Capital to be extremely insightful, as well as his work on Marx's 'epistemological break,' though his Freudian and Lacanian readings of Marx suffer from the kind of overwrought intellectualizing that was fashionable at the time. However, this memoir is an extraordinary read. We are given painful descriptions of his struggle with bipolar disorder, culminating infamously with the murder of his wife during an hallucinatory episode. Althusser does not apologize for this terrible action, but he does attempt to explain it. He maintains that the killing of his wife was the manifestation of a kind of "suicide via a third party," if you will. For those who worry about the apparent morbidity of this material, the memoir also includes excellent commentary on his political involvements such as his work with the French Communist Party as well as reflections on the May uprising of 68. We are also provided wonderful reflections on private conversations with intellectual giants like Foucault. An excellent read.

Ruth Kluger gives a remarkably lucid and thoughtful account of her experiences as WWII Austria, and eventually the concentration and forced labor camps of Germany. Even though English is not her first language, Kluger writes remarkably succinct and cogent English prose, and she confronts the moral and emotional complexity of the holocaust in her memory. "Still Alive" is loosely structured, as Kluger prefers to record the events as she recalls them as opposed to adhering to strict chronology, but the result is very interesting, she superimposes her thoughts and secrets as the horrible events unfold. She paints a vivid and, at times unusual portrait of the Nazi holocaust, often ruminating on the pain and humiliation (she wonders if her father trampled children when sentenced to the gas chamber), but also the sheer enormity of the camps as an historical event, she recalls that when she received her tattoo she felt glee because she realized that she was a part of something that was much larger than herself, something "worth witnessing." A third of the memoir is post-holocaust, Kluger recounts her experiences in New York after the war as she and her mother struggle to regain control of their lives, and look for possible meaning and redemption in their past-suffering.

Steiner's intellectual memoir may be a treat for some, and a tremendous bore for others. While it is clear that his cultural and intellectual stature is extraordinary, there is something nevertheless boorish about the way he summons great figures from the arts as evidence of his eruditions. Sentences like "It may be that too much of my father's "library," of his "syllabus" of the supreme and caustic certitude that in the face of a Homer, of a Goethe, of a Beethoven or a Rembrandt, the second-rate is precisely that, conditions and confines me still" (174). And yet, there are passages in this little text that truly shine with curious brilliance-the way in which Steiner was fascinated with the infinity of Royal insignia's as a child is particularly striking, or his early accounts of life at the University of Chicago. All the same, his laborious records of various university achievements and coterie of famous intellects is mere pretense.

Althusser is often undervalued in the French academy these days, but this contemporary disdain for the late Marxist is unwarranted, for he will prove to be one of the significant political minds of the latter half of the 20th century. This collection of essays addresses a number of issues inherent in the philosophical system and development of Marxist thought. Althusser's anti-humanist reading of Marx is useful in his repudiation of easy humanist exhortations about the essence of man, or the early Marx's 'species being.' Lenin and Philosophy attempts to reassert the significance of Lenin as a thinker of historical materialism. Althusser's structuralist account of the development of historical materialism seeks to demarcate philosophy as praxis-philosophy draws the lines which are to deflect false ideas. The essay on the Ideological State Apparatus is where Althusser develops his famous notion of 'interpellation,' or 'hailing'. The application of psychoanalytic discourse resolves a number of problems regarding Marx's work on 'false consciousness.' The essays on art (particularly Cremonini), are also provocative, though immensely difficult.

Truly a masterful work of film making from P.T. Anderson, who has clearly found his footing as one of our leading directors. Daniel Day Lewis delivers a commanding performance as the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, who creeps in on unknowing farmers to claim his prize. Based loosely on Upton Sinclair's 'Oil!' There Will Be Blood is masterful in its rich colors and textural sounds. It is a highly engaging allegory about the hypocritical bargain between the bourgeoisie and the church. It is at once a tragedy and an excruciatingly painful portrait of the demonic underbelly of the American dream.

The New Military Humanism, Noam ChomskyChomsky's take on the situation in the former Republic of Yugoslavia is the most successful rejection of NATO's intervention I have read thus far, yet it is still a superficial and ultimately unsatisfying work of political science. Chomsky insists on rehashing earlier work from his political writings in which he simply cites his own books as evidence; he devotes an entire chapter to investigating entirely irrelevant US military intervention in Indochina and Central America, pointing out the cruel imperialistic motivations of the campaigns while failing to appropriately relate them to the FRY. Unfortunately, just because the US has acted with illegitimate intentions in the past (and it certainly has), it doesn't mean that NATO's intervention in the future is necessarily motivated by imperialism, hence "the New Military Humanism," but Chomsky fails to reconcile this fundamental dilemma, and the chapter seems to imply that the Albanians should have been killed in higher numbers to necessitate NATO intervention. This section of the book simply does not work.However, Chomsky does provide fair evidence (far better than Parenti or Johnstone), that NATO was totally aware that military air strikes were going to escalate the intensity of the atrocities. He cites General Wesley Clark (about a dozen times), to the fact that the bombing's consequences "were entirely predictable." But more importantly, Chomsky investigates a US State Department which reveals that higher level planning circles were aware that NATO's bombing was likely to make Serbian aggression more aggravated. His scholarship in this section is good, keeping to totally mainstream publications like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the State Department Document in question. It appears as though NATO intervention was in fact quite reckless, though Chomsky seems to believe the conflict would have been resolved through diplomacy while providing little evidence that it was a possibility.Chomsky's scholarship in the New Military Humanism is generally good, although he does rely way too heavily on his own writing, usually on irrelevant military campaigns. And he does make some citations which are a bit curious. For example, on page 106 he discusses the illegitimacy of the Rambouillet Agreement and cites a document (footnote 6), without an author or organization and simply states that it is "widely circulated on the internet." Also, he cites the ultra-left wing Z magazine on page 69 (footnote 63), which is very unreliable. As a final qualification, Chomsky's book didn't include much of the context of the Balkans which is crucial to our understanding of the situation there; instead he preferred to rehash old US crimes which tell us little about the people, history, and culture of the various peoples in the FRY. The New Military Humanism does begin to strike at some of the problems with NATO and the US's proclamations of moral intervention, mostly in the examination of NATO's expectations of bombing and the diplomacy that followed as described above. But it is far from a complete study of the situation there, and Chomsky doesn't adequately make the case that intervention was motivated for the sake of the business elite as he was so able to do in the past.

A remarkably ambitious novel, structured around the life of Kenneth Toomey, popularnovelist and world traveler. Toomey's brother-in-law is Don Carlo, an eventual Pope.Through their complex and often inexplicable relationship, an immensely complex portraitof the 20th century emerges. Burgess manages to capture much of modern artistic andpolitical history through his labrynthine panorama of friends, colleagues, relatives, andprofessional laisons. There is much of Burgess reflected in the Toomey-both are highlyintelligent, ironically jaded writers with a penchant for drama. Yes it is unfocused at times,perhaps positively unruly. But there are magnificent scenes here-particularly aconfrontation between Carlo and Nazi torturors. As is often the case, Burgess isbound to the major theological and aesthetic questions of our time: what is thenature of true moral choice? What is freedom? What is evil? How can one live withintegrity and decency but also in peace? This novel hazards some answers. And its also damned entertaining.

Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rainbow have written a lucid explication of the major ideas of the late Michel Foucault with this brief volume. This is primarily a methodological assessment of Foucault's work, from his archaeological inquiries of asylums, clinics, and prisons, to his brilliant work assessing the 'discursive formations' of the Enlightenment in 'The Order of Things.' There are also excellent chapters regarding Foucault's work in 'The History of Sexuality,' from his interpretation of bio-power to the care of the self. This is not a totally positive appraisal of Foucault's challenging body of work, whose disparate projects failed to be unified in an intelligible and overarching theory of power. However, Foucault comes across as an immensely brilliant and provocative thinker and historian who refused to naively accept reductive programs of social change. This is a very clear and thorough work of scholarship.

"The problem of identity has been a basic philosophical issue since Parmenides. Parmenides stated it in the form: `thought and being are the same,' with a radicality and a simplicity perhaps never again possible for later thinkers. Heidegger has pondered over Parmenides' statement for years, returning to it again and again in his writings. Thus it came as no surprise to this translator when Heidegger stated that he considered Identity and Difference to be the most important thing he has published since Being and Time."So says Joan Stambaugh, the translator of this excellent lecture course by Heidegger delivered at the University of Frieburg during 1957. In it he discusses the problems of identity, sameness, and relations of beings in Parmenides, Plato, on to the logic of Hegel. The latter part of the lecture is devoted to further metaphysical questions of the meaning of Being initially taken up in Being and Time, and finally concludes with remarks of onto-theology.This volume includes the German text which is helpful, however there is really only 74 pages of material here and the volume is $16 so it's not a great bang for your buck, but the edition is as lovely as the content.

La Notte links Antonioni's 'L'Avventura' and 'L'Eclisse' together in its stark and very beautiful portrayal of the disintegration of a marriage. Although less magnificently esoteric than the great 'L'Avventura,' Antonioni's film is a necessary piece of the trilogy. Marcello Mastrioanni is the self-absorbed intellectual writer who falls for the beautiful Monica Vitti at a black and white party. His narcissism permits his own unfaithfulness to his wife. Jeanne Moreau's performance is probably the most interesting in the film; her weathered face bears the mark of a used and worn trophy, her aged beauty is no longer satisfactory for her husband, and her intellect has long since been forfeited for the sake of his ego. Antonioni was one of the most interesting filmmakers of the 1960's. His uncanny ability to incorporate setting and landscape into the thematics of the work was perhaps unprecedented. In La Notte, the story unfolds primarily in the modern house-party, which is both luxurious and stifling. Perhaps what bothered audiences most about this film was Antonioni's failure to achieve the aching sublimity of L'Avventura's final sequence, or the astonishing radicalism of the final moments in L'Eclisse. Nevertheless, for all of its shortcomings, La Notte is a remarkable film.

Jean-Luc Godard's episodic opus about a man who interviews various individuals about an unknown project called "Eloge de l'amour," which will involve three couples experiencing four stages of love. The first half of the film, shot in Paris, appears in 35-mm BW and displays some of Godard's most impressive footage. The second half, set in Brittany two years earlier, is shot in super-saturated, bright digital color, deliberately crafted to overwhelm the viewer. The film is oblique, contemplative, challenging, esoteric, and profoundly beautiful. Includes a haunting piano score from Ketil Bjornstad and Arvo Part. Not too be missed.

Naturally, there is some rather ridiculous stuff in here, but it's far from a simple how-to book. Twyla Tharp has presented a very useful guide for the creatively inclined. She emphasizes the role of discipline and craft over the erroneous view that creativity is simply the result of inspiration. Tharp outlines a plethora of daily activities and strategies for developing a life of creativity. In particular, she draws on the examples of Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and other titans as models of creative discipline. This book is not just geared for creative dance-though Tharp does tend to overindulge in her past successes. Not the answer for all our creative problems of course, but a much welcome guide nonetheless.

The German Ideology indexes Marx's 'break' from a philosophical humanism to a period of revolutionary materialism. This extraordinary book attacks the 'materialisms' of Feuerbach, Stirner, and Bauer in turn, and attempts to formulate a new conception of man as framed in terms of his alienation from the sum of productive forces. Marx's theses on Feuerbach are obviously the most read and oft quoted, and they are true landmarks in the history of political consciousness. Marx is clearly carving out a new space of empirical inquiry, a space which would give rise to a scientific analysis of the material conditions of reality-and to propose a radical political program of revolutionary change. His discussion of Stirner is laborious and painstaking; it is clearly less read and considered than it should be. It's too bad that this text is in such a poor edition-the footnotes do not lead anywhere and no one will take responsibility for the bad translation. Hopefully someone will put together a better edition in the future.

A tremendous, relatively unknown little novel by the Soviet-era writer Leonid Tsypkin pulsates with a beautiful, baroque prose style. Tsypkin's novel is at once about a day in the life of Dostoevsky as he takes his trip to Baaden-Baaden. And yet it is also the simultaneous story of Tsypkin's own investigation into the life of his literary icon--we are given an intricate representation of Tsypkin's visit to Dostoevsky's flat, as well as long ruminations on the work and the great artists' tortured sensibility. The novel works in much the same way as Thomas Bernhard's finest novels work--it is structured by the sort of long, winding sentences that take on a rhythm and life all their own. A beautiful little book that Susan Sontag had pushed to disseminate--it needs further circulation.

This text is a continuation of Heidegger's lecture series on Nietzsche. It includes Volume III: The Will to Power as Knowledge and as Metaphysics, and Volume IV: Nihilism. There is also further commentary on the much misunderstood doctrines of 'eternal return,' and the 'overman.' Heidegger argues against the fascistic Nietzsche interpretations by Baeumler and the like. Heidegger's Nietzsche is a metaphysical thinker, he shakes him off all attempts to situate him as a thinker of biologism or crude nihilism. Rather, Nietzsche is a thinker of affirmation and enhancement. Although many are hesitant to fully accept Heidegger's preoccupation with Being in this work, there are few who reject the significance of this insightful exegesis. David Krell's analysis is also helpful and thoroughly researched.

Calvino's 'If On a Winter's Night a Traveler' is a wonderfully complex literary dip into post-modernity in which the author distances the narrative and holds it under a fractured telescope. The plot is a peculiar combination of stories told with a cool detachment which all eventually converge with the two readers, who are in truth the protagonists of the story. This does not make for easy reading, and it's nearly impossible to get it all the first time through, but Calvino's remarkable command of ideas and prose will pull you into his rich imagination.

Martin Amis has long since established himself as one of Britain's leading novelists. It does not follow that he is necessarily a great critic of literature or even a great essayist. And he is not; but he is damned good all the same.This collection gathers a wide variety of literary reviews from 1977-2000 (though the majority of them were composed during the 70's and 80's while Amis was writing for the New Statesman) which provide curious readers with a marvelous resource in the realm of contemporary fiction. Amis makes no apologies for his overt reverence for Nabokov, Bellow, Roth, Joyce, and Kafka. He calls Bellow's `The Adventures of Augie March' the great American novel of the 20th century (next to Gatsby), and maintains that Bellow's late period was not characterized by intellectual nor artistic diminishment (a view I have not shared). Amis' criticism is heavily indebted to the style and philosophy of Nabokov's literary lectures at Cornell, insisting that a true reader of literature reads with `the spine' and ought to reject all theory.There is an excellent and broad array of literature reviewed in this collection, including established greats like Updike, Capote, and Murdoch, but also lesser known but exciting writers like Ballard, but he includes reviews of indubitably bad writers merely for the sake of covering the whole spectrum. Not as compelling as Amis' own literature, but very worthwhile all the same.

A terribly overlooked little novel by Denton Welch--a painter turned writer who published little in his short lifetime. Welch's prose is permeated by a sense of color, his descriptions of light, of the nuances of sensible objects shine with the ambiguous changes of an observant artist. In Youth is Pleasure is the story of the way in which incipient feelings of sexuality emerge in adolescence--and of the strange power these feelings have to permeate consciousness. This novella proceeds with the nimbleness of youth, and its place within the history of British literature has yet to be corrected.

This volume, published by HarperCollins in the sixties and edited by translator David Farrell Krell serves as the perfect compendium to the thought of Martin Heidegger, one of the most significant thinkers of philosophy in the 20th century. Heidegger's methodology is necessarily difficult, as he is trying to remove himself from the `average-everyday' language we employ; and he is trying to approach the meaning of being concretely and originally. Therefore, stop complaining about the obscurity of his style and work your way through this text, for it will remain one of the major works of European thought.The first essay is the introductory chapter to Heidegger's opus Being and Time. It is actually rather senseless to read it without going on to read the complete text. However, for those readers who simply want a taste of Heidegger's basic philosophic project and methodology, it is summarized here. He says at the outset: "This question has today been forgotten-although our time considers itself progressive in again affirming `metaphysics.' All the same we believe that we are spared the exertion of rekindling a gigantomachia peri tes ousias [a Battle of Giants concerning Being,' [Plato, Sophist]. But the question touched upon here is hardly an arbitrary one." (41). For Heidegger, philosophy has lost touched with the question `what is the meaning of being, as such?' However, in order to resolve the question of the meaning of Being, you must examine the Being of the questioner, (Dasein), leading us to do fundamental ontology.The second essay in the collection is titled What is Metaphysics? It is an inaugural address the delimited many of the major ideas he would later expand in Being in Time. In it, Heidegger again examines the meaning of Being, but he also discusses the unheimlichkeit (the uncanny), and Dasein's confrontation with "the nothing" (100), and with attunement and Nihilism generally. This is a particularly famous, though cryptic essay, the major ideas in it are expanded at great lengths by Heidegger in his book `Introduction to Metaphysics,' published later in 1953.The next essay is titled On the Essence of Truth, and it is particularly difficult. Heidegger begins with: "Our Topic is the essence of truth. The question regarding the essence of truth is not concerned with whether truth is a truth of practical experience or of economic calculation, the truth of a technical consideration or of political sagacity, or, in particular, a truth of scientific research or of artistic composition, or even the truth of thoughtful reflection or cultic belief. The question of essence disregards all this and attends to the one thing that in general distinguishes every `truth' as truth (115). Heidegger will later suggest in the essay that the essence of truth is freedom, or unconcealment. Heidegger does not adhere to radical skepticism, nor does he believe in eternal truths. He is interested in the essence of this question with regard to Da-Sein's `liberation' for `ek-sistence.'The Origin of the Work of Art is unlike any essay in the history of aesthetic philosophy or criticism, because Heidegger is not at all concerned with the beauty of art, nor with the thinking of the artist. He is interested in the capacity for art to reveal worlds. He writes: "The temple-work, standing there, opens up a world and at the same time sets this world back again on earth, which itself only thus emerges as native ground. But men and animals, plants and things, are never present and familiar as unchangeable objects, only to represent incidentally also a fitting environment for the temple, which one fine day is added to what is already there" (168). Heidegger values the art of poetry more than any other. He says, "Art happens as poetry. Poetry is founding in the triple sense of bestowing, grounding, and beginning" (202), and he valued Holderlin, Trakyl, and Rilke above all other poets. Art is an origin, and it serves to preserve the historical existence of man.One could go on and on. This volume also contains the Letter on Humanism, Modern Science, Metaphysics, and Mathematics, the Question Concerning Technology, Building, Dwelling, Thinking, What Calls for Thinking?, the Way to Language, and the End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking. They will keep you busy for quite a while.

It seems like AK press is hell bent on publishing everything Chomsky has ever written and said over and over again. Unfortunately there is nothing in this text that hasn't already been printed, so readers of Chomsky are more than likely to be disappointed as I was. There are excellent articles in here however, such as "Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship, an article on Vietnam and the Spanish Revolution which originally appeared in Chomsky's first political book, "American Power and the New Mandarins." The article is first-rate scholarship and includes excellent bibliographical information. Chomsky was probably the only American dissident in the 1960's who was discussing issues like Anarcho-Syndicalism in relation to the Vietnam conflict. The other articles in the book have also appeared elsewhere, and they vary in quality a great deal. There is some interesting discussion here on Libertarian Socialist life in the Israeli Kibbutzim as well. "Language and Freedom," is an excellent lecture which connects his linguistic work with political ideology (which Chomsky now refuses to do), and discusses classical anarchist thinkers like Bakunin and Rocker. The last couple of interviews get slightly too informal for my taste and there are hardly any footnotes to back them up, but still this is a moderately helpful collection of material which gives an insight into Chomsky's anarchist convictions

Novalis' incomplete novel, Heinrich von Ofterdingen, is characteristic of this great poet/thinker's fascination with nature, poesy, and myth. Although the Marchen of this text are rather hackneyed, there are nevertheless remarkable reflections on the nature of poetic creation in this peculiar text. There are plenty who cite this as Novalis' finest literary achievement, but I will easily take his Hymns to the Night as well as the Novices of Sais both in terms of the creative synthesis of ideas and beauty of their form. However, it is in Heinrich, that we get a glimpse at some of Novalis' more cryptic fascinations with Christian and Middle Age myth.

The Thin Blue Line- 1988- ****A stunning documentary by Errol Morris which was absurdly written off as "pseudo-journalism," and "overly-subjective," by the critics at the time. Morris makes no pretense of being "objective," with his topic; in fact, the actual topic of the film is subjectivity. A man is convicted for murder in Texas on extremely thin evidence but the opaque wheels of justice simply crank him into death row without a second thought. Morris worked as an investigative journalist in uncovering the man's innocence, made the film, and eventually got his conviction overturned because of its persuasiveness. Scenes of the crime are reconstructed and dramatized by Morris to fill in the point of view of the interviewee (not to demonstrate the truth), and the film gradually and compellingly puts together the missing fragments of the case, and turns truth on its backside. This is a brilliant documentary, and I'm not employing hyperbole when I say it is the In Cold Blood of the cinematic form.

An entertaining, albeit thin and superficial novella by Thomas Bernhard about an unlikely friendship between two sick patients in Vienna. The narrator-Bernhard's doppelganger-befriends Wittgenstein's enigmatic nephew despite their improbable arrangement. There are enjoyable portraits of Viennese culture and thought in this brief text-and Bernhard takes plenty of time to write wonderfully about music as he so often does-but there is also a bitterness to this narrative that drags it down. Furthermore, Bernhard uses an extended sequence to berate the Viennese theater culture for the disastrous premier of his play at the Burgtheater-the passage is meant to be funny but it is merely arrogant and petty. Unfortunately, Bernhard has not been able to do much with his admittedly clever conceit in this one.

Godard's misunderstood film about a cell of Maoist students in 1967 France is not so much an endorsement of revolutionary politics as it is an exploration of it. Although the film clearly contributed to the revolt at Columbia uprising, and later the student May uprising of 1968, this is in fact a highly nuanced account of the variegated tendencies of radicalization among the French youth. We encounter an outdated renunciation of Marxism-Leninism, which sadly converted large swaths of radicalizing youths to Mao in the 1960's, and still has some resonance on the left today. This is a delightful mixture of politics and pop culture as only Godard can provide, that is, with passion and form.

I don't have much to say about Holderlin's poetry, which I find a bit stodgy and ungraceful, but I have to say I cannot read it in German, which I believe is a necessary prerequisite to any true read of poetry. I would merely like to share a poem that I found beautiful:SunsetWhere are you? Dazzled, drunken my soul grows faintAnd dark with so much gladness; for even nowI listened while, too rich in goldenSounds, the enrapturing youth, the sun-godIntoned his evening hymn on a heavenly lyre;All round the hills and forests re-echoed it,Though far from here-to pious nationsWho still revere him-by now he's journeyed.Wo bist du? Trunken dammert die Seele mirVon aller deiner Wonne; denn eben ist's,Dass ich gelauscht, wie, goldner ToneVoll der entzukende SonnenjunglingSein Abendlied af himmlischer Leyer speilt';Es tonten rings die Walder und Hugel nach.Doch fern ist er zu frommen Volkern,Die ihn noch ehren, hinweggegangen. (pp 16).Enjoy the archaic read.

This collection of stories has become a paradigmatic example of post-modernist fiction. Barth's stylish wit is a wild blend of self-reflexive "meta-fiction," accompanied by bizarre mythological transformations of the American landscape. To my mind, the stories in this collection are rather dated-they no longer ring with the electricity of the moment. Rather, one can almost read them as an era that has passed. Perhaps it is because the stories evoke so little in the way of character, but I found myself always dissatisfied, with the notable exception of the title story.

Dreadful and smart-alecky piece of closed-minded, nihilistic trash from hack-director Todd Solondz of Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse fame. Palindromes marks a noticeable departure in Solondz's vitriolic hate as he begins to enter the realm of the political, taking on the issue of abortion. He devotes approximately 1/3 of the film to discrediting extreme and irresponsible pro-choice people, which he demonstrates by including a monologue from a suburban mother who explains to her daughter the value of aborting a child when it has become an inconvenience. Another third is devoted to demonstrating the absurdity of the extreme Christian pro-life individuals (whom Solondz clearly despises even more), as he reveals a house run by Christian fanatics as they take in abandoned children and feed them with violent anti-abortion polemics. Clearly Solondz has many problems with organized religion, and many problems with suburban American life; however, he also seems to have a problem with humanity. He is unable to see anything redeeming in the human race, and all his characters exhibit weakness, evil, disability, stupidity, and deep-seeded depravity. This is a cruel and narrow vision of humanity and Solondz knows it, his films are simply a gathering of scenarios which are intended to shock and horrify, nothing more. Palindromes is also distinguished by a pretentious application of multiple actresses for the same empty character. Wow. What profundity.

An extraordinarily detailed survey of Spinoza's opus, the Ethics. Wolfson leaves no stone unturned in Spinoza's elaborate metaphysical-ethical system. Through an examination of the meaning of substance, attributes, and the modes of substance's expression, Wolfson unearths the principle complexities of Spinoza's system. There are extremely clear accounts of thought and extension, the three orders of knowledge, as well as the role of the will and the affections. This is the perfect companion study for any serious reader of the Ethics.

Kertesz' prose is a mordantly brilliant, penetrating exercise in self-interrogation. It is the singularity and power of a voice--a voice that carries with it a lifetime of suffering and tragedy. It is an active consciousness reflecting in on itself the reasons why, its speaker could not bring a child into the world. Although we only ever see patches of the speaker's story, an entire history presses on us with the weight and density of the entire event that is the Holocaust. Drawing on the inspired prose style of Thomas Bernhard, Kertesz brings his own particular temperament and intellectual itinerary. This is little book will take you deep into the crevices of nothingness quickly, and without any hesitation.

There is little question that Marx was the most important economic/political theorist of the modern era. The question then, is how to present an overview of his thought in a single volume.This collection includes sections from Marx's earlier more philosophical period as a gradute student. It includes his dissertation on democritus and Epicurus as well as the famous essay 'On the Jewish Question.'Additionally, there is the great 'German Ideology,' 'Gundrisse,' and the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (one of the most important works on political revolution in the entire literature. Of course you will also find the Manifesto, and selections from Capital (though far from comprehensive) as well as the Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.I was also pleased with the editor's inclusion of several letters of Marx between him and friends and family, mostly Engels. Also, there are report cards from the young Marx while he was in school, a fun extra.The Portable Marx is a good way to begin to immerse yourself in Marx, though only a thorough reading of Capital will really allow you to appreciate the depth and range of his genius.

Henry Green was considered a major English novelist during the forties but his novels are seldom read today. This is unfortunate, for they are such pleasurable and beautiful aesthetic objects. This collection, contains some of Green's finest prose, particularly 'Loving,' an evocative portrait of a team of butlers and servants in an Irish castle during the second world war. There are moments of true depth and sadness in this little novel, with musical dialogue that is often incomparable in 20th century prose. 'Living' is a fine novel about workers in an iron foundry, and Green's attunement to the clever linguistic creations of the working class is highly skilled. 'Party Going' is about the ruling class held up in a station as they wait for the fog to clear to make it to a high class party by fairy. Although Green's dialogue of the rich is less interesting, this is a richly conceived novella about the differences of perception and happiness between the social classes. A truly wonderful achievement.
