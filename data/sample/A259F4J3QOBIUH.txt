George Washington layed the Cornerstone of The White House in &quot;Full Masonic Regalia&quot; and I have found various illustrations of our Founding Father, in his Regalia, surrounded with Masonic Symbolism, but this book contains more, including the story! I have known that America was founded upon Masonic Principles for a very long time, but this is the first book I have seen, in the public domain, that tells much of story. Also, there are many Illustrations, Full Color Photos and informative Masonic revelations in this book that I have not seen, before. I cannot claim that the Astrological information was new to me...but, I have been studying Astrology and reading Masonic texts for ten years. Anyone with a smidgeon of interest in Masonry knows that America was founded upon these Principles and the ideas of Great Men, such as John Locke..... However, most people do not realize that America is Founded upon Masonry, to the extent that it pervades the Architecture--not-only of Washington, D.C.--of our Nation. Public buildings all-over Louisville, KY and the surrounding area (including small towns in Indiana) are adorned with Masonic Symbolism. Masonic Symbolism is built into the Stonework of most of the Courthouses and other public buildings, including churches. A small town, in Indiana, even has Masonic Templar Symbolism built into the stained-glass windows. For an interesting journey, take a Carriage ride around Louisville, KY (and check-out the Symbolism on the &quot;2nd street bridge,&quot; then cross-over to Jeffersonville, IN and take a good look at the old Masonic Lodge!). It's not just D.C. Folks...it's the whole country. However, this fine book explores the wonders of our Nation's Capitol and gives us beautiful pictures of our &quot;hidden&quot; history. Nearly every Mason will want this book, because it has a photo of Albert Pike's Grave Site and lots of Masonic Symbolism, plus one beautiful, full-color Masonic Jewel !Also, High-Degree Masons are building a &quot;Masonic Museum&quot; to showcase their contribution to History and Society, which will prove this book is a wonderful addition to your collection. Buy it now, in Hardback, because this ones will be a Collector's Item, soon.....

I had high expectations for this movie, especially afterThe Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions/ The Animatrix)series, but Keanu Reeves seems to be playing the same character over and over in different films. This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great. The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus. Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching. I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie.

A.E. Waite is a well-respected author in the study of The Mysteries. However, this book is not his best work. To be honest, I never could bring myself to do more than read sections of this book. I coul dnever read it straight-through. However, given the system of Tarot, flip-throughs are usually all you need, to discover what you need to know. There are many better books on the the subject of How to Study The Tarot, but this is a good Beginner's lesson. So many people try to make the Study of Tarot a &quot;cut &amp; dry&quot; issue (i.e., &quot;this is the way it is....&quot;)--however, in actuality, it is a life-long process of Study, Experiment, and Collection of Knowledge. It is best to read books by Many authors of Many perspectives and study Jungian Psychology, as well. Consider this book a &quot;first stepping-stone on the Path of Enlightenment.&quot;

I suppose this means that my copy is a Collector's Item, now. Sigh....why are all of my favorites out of print? I wanted to do a review for the Thieves' World (Sanctuary) series, only to find them &quot;out of print.&quot; I thought, &quot;well, Marion Zimmer Bradley is a LEGEND....I'll review 'Lythande,' instead.&quot; I'm glad I take such excellent care of my books and refuse to loan them out to anyone I do not have a meaningful connection with.... I'll be saving my copy of Lythande for my future daughter, Melita Renae Lincoln. This makes me realize how important my little library is! Well...if you can acquire this compilation of stories about Lythande (Lee-THOND), you will be captivated by this character, who was born in a world that has been nearly forgotten, and was created by a woman who will not ever be forgotten. This one is not your typical hack 'n slash, Mazes 'n Monsters fare....in fact, the stories are intellectually stimulating and carry underlying layers of the writer's sentiments. Marion Zimmer Bradley also editorializes a bit, expressing her personal views about Feminism, Male Weirdness and such. As I said, I'm saving this one for my future daughter.

I watch all movies with Johnny Depp, but Pen&eacute;lope Cruz sold me on this one!I skimmed the info, but mostly purchased the film based upon the cover shot. When I watched the film, I felt my self drawn deeper and deeper into the story. The initial interest in Pen&eacute;lope Cruz subsided, as I became more an more interested in the escalating business practices of our hero played by Johnny Depp.I was rooting for our Business man, throughout the film, and I think he got the shaft. I loved the movie until the end, but they were working with biographical material so they closed the story as best they could.Suffice to say, this guy is no Scarface; he is just an entrepreneur who enjoys living it up. I think the guy should have made friends in Congress, so that he could have ended his run and kept his fancy homes, et al. C'est la vie.

The Messenger is a very thought-provoking film. I was very surprised to see a movie in-which Joan of Arc is portrayed to be very erratic, obsessed...perhaps, even schizophrenic. However, her behavior makes you wonder. Where does inspiration come from? If you hear voices, are they good ones? If you think you hear the voice of God...is it God, or your own Ego? Watch this movie and contemplate the deeper meaning of who you are and why you do the things you do. The sets are wonderful and the message is power-packed. I truly loved the characters, even if I was a little surprised. Some of the supporting characters are just as interesting as the main characters--but, I don't want to ruin the moments! The Battle scenes are terrific, they make you want to grab a sword and go fight for a cause. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the Patriarchal Dictatorship of the church, as well. You will wish you could walk into the movie and knock a few heads together, then give a lecture about proper behavior amongst &quot;men of God.&quot; This movie has it all...war, treachery, deceit, religion, good special effects...and a beautiful woman running-around in full battle gear. Things get very surreal, near the end, you'll love it!

The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

As I studied in college courses, I was glad that I had seen this film, and own it. Luther, though a bit of a nutcase, was an important historical figure, and this film explores aspects of the Catholic church which everyone should know about.Whether you care about religion or not, this information is historically important. The movie is enjoyable, and I recommend it. Protestant people may worry a little, about the foundations of their spiritual path, but people often Refer to Luther and they should know more about him.College students can save time by watching this film, as well. ;-)

No more veiled allusions to a Deeper Meaning of Masonry. No more Hints and Insinuations. No more references to obscure books, that can only be found through unfamiliar publishers. No more &quot;I know more than you, but I cannot tell you about it.&quot; No more pre-1717 cover-up. Here it is: everything you ever wanted to know about Masonry, but were afraid to ask.... Or, wanted to ask--but, couldn't get anyone to talk about it. This is the book you have been Searching for &amp; the book that will revitalize The Craft. Wilmshurst tells it like it is, after giving many Lectures amongst Masons of the world. He offers us some Gold, instead-of a Treasure Map. If all the other Masonic books left you feeling unsatiated and thirsty for more Knowledge, this book will quench your thirst and provide ample revitalization in the future. Wilmshurst believes a man should enter The Craft with no blinders or misgivings about his Work. He believes in offering the Truths he has discovered to all those seeking The Light. Anyone contemplating the idea of petitioning The Lodge should read this book...and, everyone within The Lodge should give Wilmshurst's message a respectful perusal during a quiet afternoon.

I've been listening to this one a lot, lately. Marylin Manson is the Master of catchy grooves and haunting vocals. The concept of this album and Marylin's latest transformation is invigorating.The way he has incorporated his various styles into this new style is very impressive. The subtle hints of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and his other projects tie everything together into his new persona and musical style.This one's a Dandy -- Marylin Manson is Reborn.

As a student of Anthropology & Religion, I often purchase books about various religions, cultures, etc. I own The Koran, but have not taken the time to read it, yet. So, when I found this pamphlet, shortly after 9/11, I immediately purchased it, so I could get a quick grasp on the over-all views of Muslims and the religion of Islam, aside from Web searches.I find this pamphlet to be Very helpful and Educational. I learned much more than I expected to learn from such a thin pamphlet. The pictures are beautiful and the information intrigued me.Today, while catching-up on my reviews, I noticed that this Beautiful pamphlet will soon be coming-out as Book! I intend to pre-order it, ASAP. The artwork, alone, is exquisite and the knowledge is imperative at this time in U.S. history.I sincerely hope this book is well received and well read in America.Here is some information about the upcoming book (which has the same cover art, as this pamphlet, I am currently reviewing:"Understanding Islam and the Muslims," by Henry, Winter, V. Gray Henry, Timothy J. WinterPaperback: 80 pagesPublisher: Fons Vitae; ISBN: 1887752471; (December 2002)This book can be pre-ordered, from Amazon.com

This is an Amazing Cookbook ! Low-Carb Hollandaise sauce, meals, coffee cake, and so much more! With 500 recipes to choose from, no one will get bored with the Low-Carb "diet." I assure you, anyone can eat well, and Enjoy meals, while losing weight and avoiding the sugary and starchy foods we all crave. Unlike most "diets," this is a rational system of eating Good Food, that isn't as bad for us as our usual fare. No need to give up "Chocolate" or other pleasant dessert items...just a readjustment to our usual "Seefood Diet."The author is a Terrific Cook & a Wonderful Hostess ( and she looks great ! ). I can speak from first-hand experience (and second-hand, via my wife and friends), when I say that this lady can Cook ! We have dined with her and when we discovered we were eating "Low Carb," we were very surprised to say the least!You will not starve eating Low-Carb. The recipes are to drool for.Not only is the author is a Terrific Cook, but she & her husband look great & they have a lot energy ( ! ), so I think her work speaks for itself. See her previous book : "How I Gave Up My Low Fat Diet and Lost Forty Pounds! ," by Dana Carpender (Paperback)My local public library just ordered 3 copies of the "500 Low-Carb Recipes" book, and the author was recently pictured on the front page of her own local newspaper's "Region" section making Cookies, in her kitchen.Word is spreading fast, here in Indiana (it is a much-needed book in our area), and the libraries have a difficult time keeping her book in stock.Better buy a copy, fast, before Indiana purchases them all.Please, see Linda Carroll's review, below, for more information.

Don't care, because you are an Apathetic (typical) American? Not to worry, Marilyn Manson fans can enjoy this documentary, as well as the geeks who care about Constitutions and such.Michael Moore is worth checking out. As the years pass, I am a bit skeptical of some of his work, but Bowling for Columbine is very interesting.

I bought this one on a whim--and it did, in fact, prove to be whimsical. From the very beginning of the movie, I knew that &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; would not get me through the film. So, I turned-off the analytical portion of my brain-pan, and rolled with it. I found myself laughing, out loud, while watching &quot;Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.&quot;Everything about this movie cracks me up--from the girl's goofy behavior, Spoofy Slapstick Comedy, and hilarious Over-The-Top Deductions that would make Sherlock Holmes raise and eyebrow... to the fact that &quot;The Boss&quot; has no clue what he is supposed to do and the Villain plays such a Straight-faced counterpart to the movie's general Free-for-all Goofiness.Also, this DVD comes with a video (and guest performance) by one of my favorite Singers: &quot;Pink.&quot;This is definitely a movie that will require many viewings to catch all of the subtle, and not-so-subtle jokes, and background humor.

I have been going to &quot;Shakespeare in The Park,&quot; in Louisville, KY for ten years &amp; I love the works of William Shakespeare. So, when this movie came out, I had to see it, immediately! I loved the movie so-much I had to own it. I could watch this film a dozen times (which is not normal for me). I love all of the Actors, including the supporting roles and bit-parts. This is also one of my &quot;Top-Ten&quot; list movies. Joseph Fiennes is thoroughly convincing and has the intensity to properly portray a Great Writer...and Lover. I find this movie to be very Inspirational and Moving. I recommend &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; to women AND men. It is not just a Romantic Comedy--it is intense, powerful, emotional and even has a sword-fight for the guys who don't like &quot;mushy stuff.&quot; Men should send this one to their significant other, with a note saying, &quot;How-about some Cuddle Time?&quot;

This Movie is so Absolutely Incredible, that I went to see it Twice at the movie theater! I rarely watch a movie twice, unless I wait a few years, between viewings....but, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; is a breakthrough in Visually understanding the After-Life. Most of the concepts explored in this movie are blatant depictions of Hermetic Knowledge....stuff you could only learn from the Secret Schools, after studying the books The Pope tried to Burn out of existence. This is pure Science (Hermetic Science): &quot;Raising and Lowering the Vibratory Rate (Level of Consciousness)&quot; to go to whatever level of the Astral Plane of existence (&quot;Heaven&quot; /&quot;Hell&quot; / &quot;Limbo&quot;) a person should wish to travel in the After-World. This movie makes Sense out of Dogma and shows that &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot; are just &quot;States of Mind.&quot; If you are depressed, &quot;evil,&quot; tormented, etc., Mentally...then you are in &quot;Hell.&quot; However, if your basic &quot;Vibratory Rate&quot; is a happy, satisfied, struggling towards understanding, or in-love &quot;State of Mind&quot;....you find &quot;Heaven.&quot; This movie makes so much sense and explains Dreams, The After-Life and Psychology in such a Wonderful and Beautiful format, that I must place it on my &quot;Top-Ten&quot; list!!! Be happy, when you make the Transition to the Next Life....and be happy that this is money well-spent ! Believe me, you cannnot only watch this film once--so save trips to the Video Rental Store!

I am pleased to own this new version of Dune ! For all those who did not enjoy the dark, brooding, depressing Original, this movie is for you ! Don't pass it by, because of your feelings about the first version of Dune.I avoided watching this, for quite some time--not willing to give 4 hours to a remake of the first &quot;Dune.&quot; However, I finally gave it a chance and I was very impressed!I saw the original at the movie theater, when it opened, and I watched the original again a few years ago--but, this New version is Much More Comprehensible (!!!) and flows very well. It is not so herky-jerky and doesn't have the spliced-together feel of the first movie, which just seemed like it was chopped-up and glued-together. No more dark atmosphere, either and the clothing seems more appropriate. The scenes are Wonderful and the Character Development is believable. No flat acting in this film !This version of Dune will suck you in and keep your attention for hours. The special effects are fascinating, but not over-done. It's all-about the Story &amp; you get a lot more of the Story, with this new version of &quot;Dune.&quot; This version gives a Deeper look into the life and development of the main character. His evolution from spoiled rich kid into messiah is more believable and much-more TIME is given to his personal journey and progress amongst the natives.I was very impressed with this film.There are many Classic scenes, in the old film--esp., due to Sting's performance...so, buy both of them !

I have not read anything remotely like this, before--except, perhaps, "Mia," many years ago, which has a similar feel, to some degree. However, "Kushiel's Dart" is so much more EPIC than anything I have read other than Sword & Sorcery type fiction novels.... It seems to be it's own genre.I have been trying to think of how to review this book, and other people have certainly listed the over-all scenario, religious feel, etc.--however, something I noticed, immediately, is that "Kushiel's Dart" would probably be much more appealing to Thelemites, than Christians. There is certainly a pseudo- Christian (Gnostic Christian) feel to certain religions depicted in the book. Yet, the "Love as thou wilt" attitude and admonishment speaks of Thelema (Aliester Crowley often used the catch phrase: "Do What Thout Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Law: Love is The Law, Love Under Will"). In fact, I felt many scenes of the story depicted a very Thelemic religious context.Regardless, aside from all the pantheons, religions and such, the story is engrossing in its depiction of a young, unwanted little girl rising through the social system and being singled-out by a very brilliant man who teaches her the inticacies of society and intrigue, as she is also learning about the delicacies and torment of the flesh.This lady struggles to rise from the level of slavery, yet craves being a slave, longing for the master's whip. She is caught-up in a world of seeming chaos, that is actually orchestrated by the whims of Nobility. There are many seeming contradictions and plot twists, many names to keep track of, and a few Conundrums waiting to be solved.This book captivated me through many flights and airport waiting areas--it was difficult to put-down and I recall staying in many nights, reading in hotel rooms, instead of going out in a new city. The story pulled me in and I was thankful that sequels are available. I did not want the story to end.This is the only "epic fantasy" novel (other than "Mia") I have ever read that did not have the usual Tolkienesque or Terry Brooks style characters. However, there are some surprises, which I will not ruin.

Normally, I rarely watch a movie more than once, unless I want to share the experience with someone. However, *this* is one of my favorite movies, and I have seen it several times. In fact, when I worked in a movie store, while in college, I watchedPrey for Rock & Rollspecifically because Gina Gershon was in the flick, due to her role in Bound.Bound is at times loud and violent, but the film also reveals subtle, sensual aspects of the characters that contrast with the angry gangster and the Tarantinoesque aspects of the movie.I do not think that I could ever tire of seeing this film again, or sharing it with others. Whether you enjoy Gangster films, action films, or romantic films, this movie has something for nearly everyone. If you love lesbian erotica, then definitely give this film a viewing. don't rent it, purchase it; you'll want to see it (or at least segments of it) again and again.

I liked the first Zorro much better, but this is Entertaining, Adventurous, and it has Catherine Zeta-Jones, Antonio Banderas, and people trying to take over the world.Overall, I enjoyed the film, and I loved the action sequences, but I had the feeling that it was made for the money. I did not get the same feeling from the movie that the first one created. It felt a little disjointed, like a commercial spin off. However, anything with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones is going to be satisfying.

Honestly, I wish I could give this series more stars; Red Dwarf is the Smegin' Greatest Creation of Mankind.I began watching this series in 1991, and I have always recommended Red Dwarf to everyone. I've been pimping Red Dwarf since the early '90s, but I never had a chance to finish watching the series. Now that I own the entire collection of episodes of Red Dwarf, and I have finished watching the series, I thoroughly recommend purchasing the Boxed set of DVDs.These DVDs have many extra features, edited and extended scenes, numerous extra bits, hidden features, and humorous additions which provide countless hours of entertainment.No matter how messed-up the world is, or how much the daily news can ruin your day, this Boxed set of Red Dwarf episodes and Bonus materials will brighten your life! If you do not find the series humorous, you might want to check your pulse.I personally feel a deep connection to the sets of the scenes, as well; Commodore geeks from back in the day will smirk often. In fact, the entire Red Dwarf series is likely to make you laugh and smirk, as well as adopt Red Dwarfisms. When your boss is a jerk, you can just say, "Smeeee....Smeeee." Your coworker will get it, but your boss or Human Resource Manager hopefully will not. There are a wealth of inside jokes, catchphrases and memorable scenes within the world of the Red Dwarf crew.This boxed edition is well-worth the investment! Back in the day, I watched episodes that friends had taped, so I greatly appreciate the convenience of these great quality, well-packaged, stylish, well-documented DVDs. I am very impressed with every aspect of this set; the collection was well thought out, and I look forward to inducting more people into the Red Dwarf Cult in the future. Speaking of which, the bonus DVDs also include interesting Convention footage.I will definitely update this review at a later time, but I want to start pimping the series, so more folks can enjoy the fantastic world of red Dwarf.

I became caught up in this dramatic tale of the life of Ray Charles. I had read that Jamie Foxx was going to portray Ray, so I gave the movie a chance. I never knew much about Ray Charles, though I used to be into '50s, '60s and Elvis tunes. Somehow, I never experienced much music of Ray Charles.After watching this film, I immediately purchased a "Best of" collection of his music, because I was astounded by his musical ability, craftsmanship, and lifestyle. Ray Charles is amazing, and Jamie Foxx put a great deal of effort into portraying him for this biographical film.

Personally, I love Norton Antivirus and the other Norton products. I use Norton exclusively. I've never had much luck with McAffe at home or in a corporate invironment. Working on a helpdesk, troubleshooting systems over the phone or with remote assistance, I have seen way too many issues with McAffee to trust it (especially, when it cannot be re-activated even with the password in an admin user account).I do the Updates, religiously, and never shut-down A.V. protection, unless the Network connection is disabled. This product has protected me, very well. No complaints.... except for one : It takes too long to Open the console--even when the O.S. is a fresh install. The delayed reaction is a bit cumbersome--yet, I consider the solid protection worth the delay.One thing people need to realize is that A.V. protection is just ONE of the major requirements for running a Windows system. Currently, if you are not running A.V. protection, a Firewall (!!!), Microsoft Updates and &quot;Spybot Search &amp; Destroy&quot; (or a similar Spyware / Adware removal tool that is well-tested), your system is destined for Doom.Sometimes, I must spend over an hour removing Spyware, Adware and restarting virus protection, remotely, on corporate systems (that are running McAffee and a dummed-down firewall).A good combination, for great protection, is : &quot;Norton Antivirus 2004 Professional,&quot; by Symantec &amp; &quot;Zone Alarm&quot; (firewall). However, if you do not do the Microsoft Updates, your system will be toast, regardless, and you can plan on a lot of O.S. re-installations.

I purchased this one when it first came-out, and I am still playing it quite often. Pink's catchy grooves, intense vocals, sensual tone and tough girl attitude are reminiscent of Joan Jett with a funked-up beat and a dance rhythem."Missundaztood" is one of my favorite cds, but "Try this" works, for me. I like the fact that she is being honest with herself and doing a few songs that she obviously felt compelled to do for herself and for her art--as opposed to pleasing the masses, or perpetually doing copy-cat songs of hits, like many bands resort to."Try This" is worth the purchase, for "God is a Dj," "Trouble," & "Oh My God (Featuring Peaches)" --however, I love the entire cd. The Video is a really nice bonus, as well !

Ok, I was suckered by the previews and the cover. I thought (or hoped) this would be sort of a step daughter gets freaky kinda movie. Perverted, yeah, but...wait till you learn more about the family!I became caught up in this film, despite my original expectations not being fulfilled. Ironically, I came to care about the characters, and rooted for closure. This movie is difficult to review without giving the good stuff away, but if you can set aside your preconceived notions and roll with the story you are in for a wild ride.Even the slow scenes are full of tension, and I consider this to be a Psychological thriller. This movie is full of teenage motifs, family psychoses, action, and revelations that unfold into a great climax.

Confused by numerous web sites ? Web sites disappear, leaving you even more confused ? If you want to research the (in)famous org, known as the O.T.O. ("Ordo Templi Orientis"), this is the book you need to get started. I once believed the OTO was a lot different than it actually is, due to various factions claiming the name "OTO." However, this book clears everything up and relates the story of the Lawsuit that settled the matter, once and for all. The "Official" OTO, with legal rights to the name, and Tax-exempt status, is explained & explored, in-depth, in "The Equinox : The Review of Scientific Illuminism : The Official Organ of the O.T.O. [ Volume III ] Number 10."I have been researching occultism, religion, anthropology, etc. for over ten years, and this is the only book I have ever found that gives an adequate, accurate and concise explanation of the OTO, Thelema, & Crowley's Raison d'etre.Anyone can build a website, but this book contains the Legal information, related to the OTO, Crowley's estate, etc.The Bonus materials are good reading and make-up for the dryness of some of the technicalities involved in explaining the history of the OTO. This volume contains "The Book of The Law," clarifications about the religion of "Thelema," & Masonic / Templar connections to the organization of the OTO.Anyone researching religion, occultism, "Secret Societies," Crowley, Thelema, Masonry, Anthropology or Sociology should definitely put this one on their wish list.This is not the most exciting book you will ever read, but it IS crammed with information, in an easy to ingest format. Also, purchasing this book is like buying several for the price of one!

I found this book to be very Enlightening, due to the fact that I have always been taught that Yoga and &quot;Eastern Philosophy&quot; are Negative in nature, in the Spiritual sense. However, I have always Admired great men like Gandhi and Deepak Chopra.I have felt, for a long while, a strong desire to understand the Philosophy of Gandhi &amp; Deepak Chopra. Recently, the opportunity arose for me to begin practicing Yoga &amp; work my way up to Kriya. So, as with all things, I wanted to read back-ground information. The wonderful Kriya gentleman I met sent me this book and I devoured it in two days--despite all the foreign words and names, which I wanted to ingest fully and not skim-over. This gentleman also strongly recommended &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi,&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda--which I have ordered from Amazon.com.I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of &quot;Autobiography.....&quot; because this story Captivated me! I felt very in-tune with the young &quot;Mejda&quot; who evolved into a great Yogi, who spread the Light of Yoga teachings to the West.I know, from studying occult works, that Yoga &amp; Eastern Philosophy was not always well-accepted in America. However, &quot;Mejda&quot; did a wonderful job of Educating Americans and set-up 70 Yoga centers in the world. He must have been an Amazing man.I am very-much looking forward to my journey in Yoga &amp; I strongly recommend these books to anyone involved with Yoga &amp; Eastern thought. I am beginning to understand Hinduism.This book is very well-written and you will find yourself glued to it. My eyes were riveted to the pages, until I finished reading the last page.I am ever-indebted to the gentleman who sent me this book, for opening my eyes to the Wisdom of Yoga. I recently discovered that the West's early antagonism against Yoga came strictly from personal animosity against people like Mdme. Blavatsky, by other organizations. I have concluded that the Negative attitudes toward Yoga and Eastern thought, by Westeners is due to Ignorance of the truth--not any valid argument against the system of thought.Make sure you buy the Autobiography, because this story is one you will not want to end !

I have loved this album, since I first heard "Turn Off the Light" & "I'm Like a Bird" (two of my favorite songs). For a long time, the airwaves and television were permeated with Nelly Furtado's music, and I enjoyed every song, video or performance.Then, when the airplay dwindled, I felt compelled to purchase the album. I have played it, subsequently, more times than I can possibly remember. I love to put the album on while doing housework, or just for ambient music, or to crank it up and just dig the Vibes.I very rarely enjoy an entire album, and normally only like 2-5 songs on a CD. However, I thoroughly enjoy each and every song on Nelly Furtado's album--the music, the vocals (!), the stories, et al.I am looking-forward to purchasing her latest album, as well. I've enjoyed the Launchcast videos, as a preview.Nelly Furtado has a very unique sound--her voice and the amazing fluctuations she can produce are soothing, powerful, emotional and humorous. I can actually see her smile, or grin with sarcasm, etc., as she sings. She obviously poured her emotions into her music. The music, itself, is very catchy. The grooves, vibes and beats stay in my head, lingering afterward. I love this CD.

If you are an open-minded person, that has always asked "too many questions," this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, Freemason, Wiccan or Occultist, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. The theories expressed in this book can be compared with the writings of Henry Lincoln ("The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau...." & his more recent works), "The Hiram Key," by Knight & Lomas & the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning.... Research the genre and decide for yourself.

I love this film, and I would love to see it with Absinthe, preferably Mansynth, but that might still be illegal? This movie calls for some kind of Altered State, and Margaritas are legal.This movie has everything; beautiful people, singing, acting, performing, dancing, drinking, love, romance, and...best of all...Bohemians.If your buddies give you grief about a Musical, point out that Nicole Kidman is in the flick. Show them a scene or two. I'll watch anything with Nicole Kidman, and this is very good !Tell your Congressman to legalize Absinthe, so folks can enjoy the movie as it was probably meant to be viewed. I hear Marilyn Manson has the good stuff.

How do you define &quot;Reality?&quot; This film provokes those uninclined to question the deeper meanings of life and states of being, to ponder theories of &quot;What is&quot; &amp; &quot;What if.&quot; For those of us who already ponder the Big Questions, this film is an action-packed, visually-pleasing adventure into the concepts we play with in our heads. If you study Hermetic Science, this movie seems to depict a great representation of the basic structure of Astral Travel &amp; the Astral Environment. If not, it seems a very good example of how Dreams work..... So how do you know you are not Dreaming, right now, as you read these words? Are you jacked-in? Will my words disintegrate into a thousand shards of triangular mirrors and leave you face-to-face with the reality your sitting on the edge of a deep chasm...falling-forward into darkness? Or, will you.....Wake Up?

I first saw this at a theater, and walked out thinking, "WTF?!" The movie was even more intense on the big screen. Yet I eventually bought the film, and I've watched it on DVD a few times.Despite the dreary, dark, and depressing aspects of the movie, I like the premise of the film. I also very much see "The Dark Pope" as a possibility, since the history of The Church is one of Conversion at Sword point. The premise is solid, but the pace is slow at times. I would give The Order five stars if it picked up the pace a bit.In summary, after my initial reaction, I have come to appreciate this movie. I recommend it.

This book is a classic, and a treasure. Reading about the rituals of Freemasonry is fascinating, but to see illustrations of the gestures that are described is to take the study up to the next level. Many Masonic symbols are illustrated and codes for reading certain Masonic texts are revealed. This is a handbook for Masons, but those who study without the lodge will gain some insight, from previous reading. This book will not give you a free pass into the lodge...but, it may inspire you to petition one! I keep the Hardback version on-display, beside The Holy Bible and &quot;Freemasonry: A Journey Through Ritual and Symbol,&quot; by W. Kirk MacNulty. This Paper-back version is just as impressive as the Hard-back, the other one is simply prettier to look at on the shelf. Either way, you can't lose!

As a teenager, I was a big fan ofMiami Vice: The Complete Series, and I loveThe Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)so I bought this 2 disk Anniversary edition of Scarface.At the time I purchased this, I had been listening to many Gangsta Rap and Hip Hop CDs, and I've read that many musicians are inspired by this film. The Special Features explore the music industry's fascination with this classic movie.This is literally a story of "rags to riches," and this is also a story of becoming power mad. I was completely engaged and mesmerized by his rise to power, but it is sad to see that he let his power become paranoia and he hit his personal stash instead of being a business man. He reminds me of Uncle Sam, right now. Too much power, but not enough Self Control.America loves (and often votes for) its Gangsters, and this is a great tribute to the ideals of North America. At the risk of being labled a "Turahist," I love this movie and so do most North Americans. Sad ending, but a great film.

I listened to the sound clips, many times, then purchased the CD. I am very happy that I decided to purchase this item! I have completely lost count of how many times I have played &quot;Songs for Elegua.&quot;I am not a trained Vodou / Voodoo practitioner, but I have been working with it on my own, via book knowledge and personal experience, for a year or so. I began, studying the subject from an Anthropological perspective, and &quot;Songs for Elegua&quot; seems to correspond with the research I have done, so-far. Regardless, it works.When I played the CD, the atmosphere changed, and I really enjoyed the rhythem, chanting and drum beats of the music.Personally, I just enjoy the music, aside from the context, as well--the music is soothing, yet powerful.

Angelina Jolie as model Gia. This is a very good film, with a great story, and Angelina is fantastic. I am unfamiliar with the original model and the biography of Gia, but I loved this film. SinceHackers, I've watched anything with Angelina Jolie, and she seems right for the character portrayed. I doubt that many actresses would have pulled off the "hooked" scenes as well as Jolie.

Suspend disbelief, or Alter your mental state, and roll with it. The plot is not particularly believable, but Ice Cube is the man on screen. His attitude and person take over the movie, and he makes up for major plot holes in the film. This one cannot be taken as realistically (?) as Van Diesel'sXXX (Unrated Director's Cut), but this movie is fun and entertaining.If you think of the film asFriday Collection (Friday / Next Friday / Friday After Next)meets XXX, its all good. However I will watch anything with Ice Cube in the flick. I think he was stretching it a bit on this one, but countless scenes compensate for the unbelievable aspects. Have a Margarita, and roll with the inconsistencies. The action and Tank Jacking are worth it.

I have worked with this deck on-and-off, for almost four years, and I must say that it gives very accurate results. I do not think it is a great Beginner's Deck (try Rider-Waite for that)--however, the woman who created this deck infused a wealth of information into the Artwork. Many people are leary of this Tarot deck, due to the fact that Crowley had a less than reputable persona. Yet, from all the research my Wiccan Wife has done, it seems Frieda Harris had a tremendous amount of influence in the project. I believe each person should judge for themselves. Some of the cards do, in fact, have a dark, brooding feeling to them, yet for some of these cards it is deservingly so. The Major Arcana are quite Beautiful and the Esoteric Symbolism worked into the Deck, throughout, is a Wealth of Knowledge. The placement of two Major Arcana cards are different than most standard decks, but comparable with a set of Egyptian Tarot Cards, from another Mystery school.Previously, I was not willing to review Crowley's works, due to his reputation. However, I discovered that the reputations of the founders of an org. I learned-from were just as impugnable. I must give Crowely respect for at-least being Honest about his nature and not deceiving his students.As with all things in life, it is best to investigate many different branches of this field of study, but I know that Most of the Tarot Readers I have met use The Thoth Deck more than any other deck in their collection. The Wonderful Artwork and Fascinating Symbolism give the Reader a vast-array of information to draw-from. My Wife is a locally renowned Tarot Reader and she swears by this deck, for accuracy....and, ALL of her friends swear by her Accuracy! &lt;She Never Charges for Readings...it is strictly from the Heart. I strongly advise against accepting readings from people who charge more than $15 for a reading &amp; I would never even Consider calling a Psychic Hotline....they just make Real Readers look bad. Buy a Deck, for yourself and teach yourself.&gt;The Thoth Deck has some Great Companion Books, such as: &quot;The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot; -- by Angeles Arrien &lt;&amp;, of course, &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot; by Aleister Crowley, Frieda Harris (Illustrator)&gt;I suggest buying the hand-sized Deck, because Large Decks are usually very cumbersome and it is hard to get a good psychokenetic feel for the cards. It is always best to have a deck that can be easily manipulated in the hands, for better accuracy in readings.In my opinion, this deck is one of Crowley's greatest Contributions to those involved with The Mysteries.I also strongly suggest studying Jungian Psychology, in conjunction with Tarot studies.Thousands of people believe this is the best deck on the market.

&quot;The Law is For All&quot; was recommended to me, by an On-Line Friend. I had read &quot;Then Book of The Law,&quot; Online, several times &amp; was not quite sure what to make of it. I could not quite understand what the fuss was all about. However, &quot;The Law is For All&quot; explained-away all those little things that had confused me or led me to believe that &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; was just Crowley's personal writings. When I started looking into all this, I was a firm believer that Crowley was the man I had read about from Colin Wilson's perspective and Nevill Drury's perspective, etc. In other words, my opinions were formed by the Research of others.... Yet, when I actually took the time to sit-down and read Crowley's works--well, I was amazed at his Genius and his Anthropological views of Humanity. I never expected to gain Anthropology lessons from his works--but, he was truly an Observer of the Human Condition....all of which adds to this &quot;Commentary&quot; on the &quot;Book of The Law.&quot;What amazed me, until I realized that this book was written in the same way as all other &quot;Holy Books,&quot; was the fact that it is, in fact, a &quot;Holy Book.&quot; This book was written in the same fashion as &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; or any other &quot;Holy Book.&quot;Aliester Crowley served as The Prophet, and the book was written Through him (even if he was not exactly happy to be the Writer of the Work).&quot;The Law is For All&quot; has awakened me to the validity of certain religions that I had never really considered as such, previously. I think this book is a good example of why we should ALL be respectful of each-other's religions and &quot;Holy Books,&quot; because they are ALL written in the exact same fashion. Regardless of whether or not you agree with &quot;The Book of The Law,&quot; one cannot deny it is a &quot;Holy Book&quot; to many people.

For nearly ten years, I have flirted with the idea of studying Cabalah (Kabalah, Qabalah--however you want to spell it) and I have been a member of several Mystery Schools and Masonic organizations that espouse the need to study Cabalah.... However, until I found this book, I just was not sure where to begin (this decision was difficult, pre-Internet) !Previous to reading this book, I knew of Gematria, Notariquon, Temura and the basic layout of the Tree of Life --and I even tackled Crowley's &quot;777,&quot; but I just was not sure what to start memorizing, or which school had it right....This book cleared-up so many of the confusing aspects of The Cabalah and the Tree of Life--with clear, concise descriptions of the various aspects of the study (with helpful illustrations). This book is the equivalent of having a Teacher, who takes the time to explain The Cabalah, in detail --without all the usual egotistical, rambling, extraneous material found in many books on the subject (e.g., Crowley's dissertations on the subject).John Michael Greer takes you by the hand and says, &quot;Let's start with the beginning....&quot; --whereas Crowley just throws you into the Deep End and says, &quot;Sink or Swim.&quot;Personally, I like Greer's method of Teaching Cabalah! Reading this book makes studying Cabalah interesting, fun and EASY (and you do not need to wade through numerous pages of extraneous ramblings to find the teachings--they are all laid-out and diagramed, concisely....unlike most pretentious works on the subject).I also highly recommend purchasing the following book in conjunction with (or because you cannot find/afford this one, due to the sad fact that it is ludicrously &quot;out of print&quot;) :&quot;The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford: Dilettante's Guide to What You Do and Do Not Know to Become a Qabalist&quot; by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 1578632153). This book receives rave reviews from Kabalists.These two books, together, are perfect for the Beginner. Both of these men have a wonderful way of setting Personal Ego aside, and explaining Cabalah as a Friend and Teacher, instead of a Mystical &quot;Know it All.&quot;Anyone who has ever been Intimidated by the study of The Cabalah, or by various well-known Cabalist's works, should acquire this book (if possible) and Duquette's book, as well.Also, obviously, you will need the famous &quot;777&quot; and other well-known Cabalistic Reference works (Sepher Yetzirah, etc.)....but, for the Beginner, &quot;Paths of Wisdom&quot; is the perfect starting point on the Journey up The Tree of Life.

A Diplomat's world is turned upside down, and those he trusts become enemies. Spies, betrayal, lies, and manipulations destroy a cultured life. Suddenly, the world around him is revealed, and he realizes that he was living in a world separated from the real world.Sure, the Brits make for some slow moments, but their is also a lot of action, henchmen, and plot twists to keep you interested. More is revealed, as the movie unfolds, and we sympathize with those affected by the complicated governmental "influences."There are cultural and other aspects of this film which give it added power and which give the viewer more perspective. I do not want to give anything away, but this movie provides drama, action, and mystery. This is not a James Bond or Bourne film, but the action sequences balance the calm, slower scenes. Both women and men would enjoy this one.

I purchased this album, based upon movie experiences....I passed upHouse of 1,000 Corpses, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome. I never rented it. However, I watchedThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and loved the movie. A coworker explained that this was a "part two" ofHouse of 1,000 Corpses, so I gave it a chance.I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves. I also purchased the following items related to this flick;House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics),The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own. I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.Troll Amazon for "Rob Zombie" and "White Zombie." He never disappoints (at least, he never disappoints me). I believe that people understand and appreciate Rob Zombie's work more when they have experienced his body of work. He blends everything; music, movies, performances...it all collects in the brain pan, and becomes a cornucopia of images and sounds which play upon each other. He builds a collage in your head. The CD, alone, would not do the trick; you have to see the movie, first.

This set of cards, with book, is obviously made for women, by women.... However, I found it very useful, not-only as an Anthropological collector's item, but as a Spiritual Tool. A man who is not willing to accept the Feminine in himself and the world will Never achieve harmony with Nature's Laws. This set is a Wonderful gift or purchase for anyone interested in Spirituality/Religion/Mythology/Goddesses (THEY ARE RENDERED VERY ARTISTICALLY AND EXUDE BEAUTY AND FLOWING, GRACEFUL FORM !) and related fields of interest. You cannot go wrong with this set. If-only Tarot cards were produced so well! My Tarot collection pales in comparison with the presentation of these cards...which you will find yourself meditating upon, simply because they are so Inviting and Beautiful.... I bought one for my Girlfriend, and had to get one for myself !

Terence Stamp, as a Transexual...need I say more? OK...I will: &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; is a wonderful, frollicking (or is it &quot;frocking?&quot;) Adventure. Terence Stamp (of &quot;The Hunger&quot;) is fabulous as an aging transexual, with bitter views and a sarcastic, biting sense of humor. His fellow(ette) travelers are performers, en route to the show of their lifetime, across the desert land of Australia....bickering and cat-fighting the entire way. Some of the banter is obviously a politically incorrect portrayal of gay men--the lines are often inspired by the worst-case scenario of gay men bickering--yet, I've met a few of those guys, in real life...so, the PC people will need to suspend their sense of appropriateness and enjoy the entertainment. This is NOT just a movie for &quot;gay culture,&quot; as some people think. Straight couples enjoy the film and there are many hilarious scenes that couples can appreciate, together. There are some very Dramatic episodes that make the film more than a Comedy and aspire to give you an understanding of the sub-culture and humanity of the characters (despite personal prejudices). Besides, let's put the Anthropological Dissertation aside and get down to the core of the matter.... &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; is a great movie!Wait'll you see what one Lady likes to do with Ping-Pong Balls ; )

Normally, I do not enjoy watching movies, repeatedly...however, this is Monty Python! I've seen this one many times and spread the word throughout the land.... I am proud to say that I have inspired hundreds of people to watch this movie, and they have done the same. I know of groups that have &quot;Grail Quests&quot; every year, because of this Classic. If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing the boat....but, you can find it if you purchase &quot;Erik The Viking!&quot; (another humorous Python escapade, with religio-philosophical overtones). All Monty Python is Fabulous!!! John Cleese should be Prime Minister, or....King ! Imagine The Royal Court! I'd love to see live coverage of all his meetings with other World Leaders.

Back in the day, a roommate brought this home on VHS. I had always avoided most zombie and Undead flicks, but this one sucked me in. Bruce Campbell takes himself so seriously, and the action is so wacky that the horrifying Undead creatures are not the main focus. Sure, I was pinching the seat a bit, but the humorous scenes were relief from the Insane Lovecraftian creatures.The superhero was so smug and sure of himself that he inducted me into Zombie / Undead flicks, and I've always loved this Campy movie. This is one of those flicks that you can watch again and again. Also, if you can't get people to watch Undead films, this is a good initiation for your squeamish friends. I wouldn't start them off withThe Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition).Army of Darkness is one to treasure, and it is always good for laughs amongst fellow geeks. Bruce Campbell is a superhero for the geeks of the world, even as he gets his arse kicked by Liliputians.

Homophobic men should leave this one alone, but anyone with an Open Mind and a Sense of Humor will appreciate the wild &amp; crazy antics of these Invaders from Transexual Transylvania.... In fact, this movie is a cult-classic. See why this low-budget movie has caused flocks of followers and fans to visit unique theaters weekend-after-weekend for decades, not-only to watch this movie...but, to Participate in the film (or, rather, in-front-of the film). I am from a small town where a movie like this would never be shown, but I heard rumors about it, long before I ever saw the movie.... So, I went on a quest to find a copy to rent. Where I live, I could not ever find this Classic. Then, one day I latched onto a copy and I have been a fan, ever-since! That was nearly ten years-ago. I even tried recording it from a VH1 airing (but, it was Edited :( Now, everyone can own a copy...a brand-new copy that has not been played so many times the scenes are fuzzy! (People become Addicted to the Fun-Filled, Frolicking Adventures of these Androgynous Icons).Anyway...this movie stars TIM CURRY. Need I say more? This guy is Great, in everything that he does (Watch &quot;CLUE&quot;: 6300214699 &amp; &quot;LEGEND&quot;: 1558807381 !!!). Tim Curry is one of those rare Actors that steals the scenes in every movie he has ever been involved with. Check-out this one, as-well: 6305428077My girlfriend played &quot;Columbia&quot; in the Vogue theater, in Louisville, KY for a while...and a friend of mine once played the &quot;Eddie&quot; (Meatloaf) character--riding his motorcycle down the center aisle during each show...so, I know what I'm talkin' about. This is a movie you will invite your friends over to watch! Again...and again...and again....and (you get the idea). Get your Roll of T.P., Newspaper, Umbrella, Water Pistol, etc. ready and join the adventure! (But, try to keep your friends from riding their motorcycle through your family room).

I have been thrilled about this movie, since the first preview I saw at the theater. Kate Beckinsale has a powerful presence on the screen. The opening scene is worth watching the movie-- Kate Beckinsale's stylish landing and rising is very impressive and kicks-off the movie with finesse.I have never been much of a Werewolf movie fan, but Underworld gives The Werewolf an intensity and a Humanity that I have not seen, previously. The motivations of the characters are fascinating.The Vampire leader was a bit lame, but all of the other characters were outstanding. The concept of Underworld, the Amazing Special Effects, sets and fast-paced Action are captivating. I had to own this movie.Currently, I am purchasing the new version: &quot;Underworld (Unrated Extended Cut)&quot; DVD -- ASIN: B0001WTUH6 -- due to the special features, extended scenes, et al. Normally, I cannot watch a movie repeatedly, within the same year--but, Underworld stands-out as a &quot;must see&quot; and &quot;must see again&quot; film.

This boxed set is very nice; it contains several DVDs, a booklet, and a fold out chart. Each DVD contains a different version of the movie, and the Chart describes the changes (additions or edits) in each version of the film.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I recommend the Director's cut. Watching this sort of thing andThe X-Files: The Ultimate Collectionmakes me feel better about real experiences. Watching some other poor bastard go through it is much better.For those of you who live in the city, get away from the light pollution for a while. You'll appreciate this special edition boxed set even more.Regardless, this movie set is fantastic, and the special effects are terrific. I had never seen the movie, until I purchased this set. Recently, I enjoyed the film, and I recommend this edition.

How could anyone watch this film only once? &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is a Wondeful, Funny, Romantic Adventure movie that combines nearly every imaginable &quot;Fantasy&quot; scenario a Child or Adult could &quot;Wish&quot; for! That's right...I said Adult--You'll love this movie, too (having children around is a great Excuse to watch the movie, but isn't necessary). A &quot;Farm Boy&quot; turns...well, I can't tell you that, now can I ? There are many fascinating characters that you will not ever forget: A Spaniard, in search of the man who killed his father, a Giant, an Egocentric little man with Big Ambitions, a Wizard (played by Billy Crystal!), a Beautiful Princess....and &quot;The Dread Pirate Roberts.&quot; This film contains unforgetable scenes, that many of my friends love to repeat (especially people who are into Role-Playing Games--In fact, in one RPG group I have been involved-with, you get Bonus Points if you somehow manage to work a line or two from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; into your character's communications with other PC's!). The way the Grandfather (Peter Falk) tells the story to the young boy (Fred Savage) is truly charming. Let's face it, to eccentric people, this movie is pure Gold. Children love the movie, because it is such a fascinating adventure story, with Sword-Play and funny scenarios, but Adults love the movie because of the intricate Word-Play and....ok, because they are Big Kids, at heart. There, I said it. If you are a Big Kid, with a Little Kid, this movie is your new best friend! I must say, Cary Elwes (&quot;Farm Boy&quot;) is Astounding! If you loved him in &quot;Men In Tights,&quot; you will fall on the floor, laughing, when you watch &quot;The Princess Bride!&quot; (Note: keep your VCR remote handy, because you will rewind scenes and watch them twice!)

Stigmata will challenge your indoctrinated thought-cells, or make you reflect upon the fact that only a few decades ago, this movie could not have been made. To perpetuate the Repression of Free-Thought and the Power of Dogmatic teachings, the church has controlled everything from education (modern history included) to personal sexuality...and communion with God. This film reveals some of the Inversive teachings and disinformation the church has used to stay in power. Obviously, everyone knows the Extremes the church has gone to, in order to perpetuate false teachings, such as the Earth being the center of the Solar System and all the other things men and women were forced to recant, because some guy in a big hat had an Ego problem the size of the Great Pyramid.... However, how many people know just how far the church has gone, down the path of insanity, to prevent anyone from becoming a Free-Thinker? After-all, they created the Inquisition--which has been proven to be a rampage of murderous carnage--inspired by madness, ignorance and power-tripping, egomaniacal nonsense. This movie awakens us to some of the truth....but, how much more is Hidden within the vaults of the vatican...denied to Intelligent eyes that are not a part of the system? I have read a few Papal Bulls....sounds like insanity, to me...but, at-least they are appropriately named. No wonder the Freemasons were persecuted so much, throughout time, and continue to be persecuted today. The funny thing is, if the church would just release the truth, they could regain their dignity and be a source of inspiration to mankind, instead of wallowing in pompous lies and blaming everyone-else for their inner demons. This movie is the closest thing I have seen to a revelation of the inner hierarchical ridiculousness of the former most-powerful organization on Earth (which is Flat! God says so!), so buy a copy and watch it with your friends. The film is very-much designed for &quot;Gen-X&quot; and has the feel of a Music Video, during various segments. There are some bizarre scenes that make you wonder if the special effects will inspire drug users to make this one a cult classic....but, the foundation of the film might provide others to delve into their favorite Internet Bookshop, for more deprogramming.

I have loved this film, since the first time I got my hands on a copy, ten years-ago! Unfortunately, it seems most of the great aspects of this movie have already been covered--&quot;Tony from Down Under&quot; did a fine job of reviewing &amp; commenting about this film--however.... I would like to add that this film is not-only a very well-made, well-casted and classic treasure, but is also a Wonderfully Stimulating movie for Couples! You've probably seen the parody scenes inspired by this film and you may even know they are somehow connected with this movie, yet you may not realize how ... sensual this movie can be for a relationship. &quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot; is a must-see for Couples, married or not, because of the many &quot;Role-Playing&quot; concepts explored and the many sensual explorations of normal, everyday surroundings. A scarf can become a blindfold, food becomes....experimental, Dining becomes Adventure, Life becomes a Game....and you play to live Life to the Fullest. If the basic concepts of the movie are adapted to a relationship (sans the Ego-Tripping), the relationship becomes stimulating, refreshing and always-evolving, instead-of stagnating or boring. Lovers who explore these techniques will be inspired to recreate their own romantic scenarios.... This is an inexpensive way to add decades of Adventure to your private relationships. Have a blindfold, candlelight and massage oil ready, guys--because, she'll want you to spoil her, after you watch this one together!

This has always been my favorite movie. Back when the only access I had to this film was via a Music Video show, "When Doves Cry" became my favorite song, and "Let's Go Crazy" was a close second. I watched every Prince video, and eventually had access to Satellite by babysitting. I saw Purple Rain several times on satellite, later bought the vhs tape, and I purchase better versions as they are released. This movie inspired me throughout life. Ironically, I accomplished most of my dreams and desires without becoming famous, but the movie is inspirational for numerous reasons.I loved the androgyny of the '80s, the glam, and the wild lifestyles. Prince was and is a master of music, performance, and I dig his acting as well. I also recommendUnder the Cherry Moon, and his other movies, recorded performances, etc. However, for me, Purple Rain is "it." This movie was the crux and focal point of my life, for a long time. I lived a unique life, inspired by this film, and lived out many dreams. To me, this movie is about doing whatever it takes to get where you want to be, without losing your Self in the process.Prince is an amazing musician. I own most of what he has created on CD, and I never tire of his music. I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, because of my recall. However I do not know how many times I have seen Purple Rain.I believe that many people who are Driven, and want to achieve will appreciate this movie. Those who did not live it might want to visit the era. Our "future" became boring, and all the Individuals became automatons. Shake it up. "...Go Crazy...."

I truly enjoyed this well made film. I noted countless reasons to watch the movie again, because some scenes are filled with a myriad of images and activities which keep the eyes moving over the screen. The story is great, and the animation is fantastic!I have been informed, by a Costume Designer with an Art/Design degree, that I should definitely watch the Bonus materials, as well. I have not seen those aspects, yet, but they get a great review from the Designer.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and look forward to seeing it again.

After reading the Shannara series, you may need a little comic relief. &quot;Magic Kingdom For Sale&quot; has the same great writing style, but less Intensity....you won't feel so nervous about the main characters and the quest is more like your own life--how the heck am I going to straighten this mess out? What did I get myself into? --except for the fact that your friends are not quite human and your world is completely new...and you have more responsibility than you ever imagined, just when you thought you were FINALLY going to get a break...and then this Dark Lord character wants to take-over everything and.... Oh, read the story! This series is more at-home on the shelf beside &quot;The Hitch-hiker's Guide,&quot; than the Shannara series. You'll love it!

This is, quite possibly, one of the goofiest portrayals of Witchcraft I have ever seen (and I live with a Witch). However, despite the fact that there is not one accurate reference to &quot;The Craft&quot; in this movie, it has inspired an amazing number of young girls to seek Literature about the subject and has broken-down a lot of the silly barriers to discussing the subject. Anyone who takes this movie seriously may need counseling, but it is great fun! The characters are perfect for their parts and I must admit this is a very...um, &quot;visually pleasing&quot; film. I really enjoyed The Craft and I know countless young women who have been affected by the film. However, one must keep in mind: This is JUST a movie &amp; Hollywood's version of Witchcraft. If they were really like that I would not be living with one! Anyway, have fun and enjoy the mythical adventures of these teen &quot;Witches,&quot; then buy some books to comprehend the reality of Witchcraft.

Ahh...at-last.... We reach The Keep. Journey to the hidden storehouse of knowledge, protected by the Druids. Allanon risks all in this episode of the series! You will sit on the edge of your seat, as Allanon and company attempt to enter the last refuge of hope for the enlightenment of humankind (and otherkind). Read &quot;The Sword&quot; &amp; &quot;The Elfstones,&quot; first...then, kick-back with this one on a cold, Winter day. Writing these reviews convinces me that it is time to re-enter Brook's world, once-more. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment. His writing is very enticing...his words draw you into the story, and you cannot escape his world. Tolkien got me through Middle school and Terry Brooks helped me survive High School, although I must admit I read Tolkien again and again--however, Terry Brooks is the only author I feel that I can mention beside the name of the master. This novel is not a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; nock-off, it is completely original. If you are looking for copy-cat stories, you should look else-where--although, the series does contain some of the same creatures and humanoids (sort-of), they are very original and exciting. I agree with the Future scenario, because of certain buildings and such that are encountered during the journey....our world devastated and rebuilt with Magick. One aspect of Brook's series that I feel very attracted to is the character Allanon, a Druid that sleeps for centuries or decades and awakens when he is needed. I have always felt a strong connection with this character.... Interestingly, this mysterious character guards a secret Storehouse of Knowledge and strives to save humankind from the Demonic Forces that want the world to live in Ignorance and Despair.

I came-across this series at the age of eighteen and purchased the entire set, thinking that it would be a good way to spend the winter months. However, although it was still warm and beautiful outside, I became caught-up in the magickal journey and spent the next week and a half devouring the series! At the time, I was an avid fisherman and spent almost every free moment traversing the countryside fishing, wade-fishing, hiking and spelunking.... Yet, the books called to me and I found myself holed-up in my room day after day, instead. The day I finished the series, I realized the journey was over and I couldn't believe I had read the books so quickly! This required another trip to the bookstore, to stock-up for the cold months. There are many things in Eddings' books that you will not find in other fantasy worlds...like this Monk-like character, who walks through solid rock...with detailed descriptions of the process. I feel compelled to give this guy a plug, because his name just doesn't pop-up enough, in the genre. Eddings is well-worth giving a try, despite his lack of recognition.

Intrinsically woven into the fabric of time, is a hidden school of thought. Principles of heretical, hidden knowledge, coded into the Philosopher's library of secret works. Gematria, Temura, Notariquon. Veiled allusions, deciphered by man. Intricate conspiracy of Rosicrucian branches of the Tree of Illumination. Infatuation with symbolic overtures of hidden music. Initiation into a world of spiritual exclusiveness and egotistical adherence to a scientific, structural revelation of the mind of Deity. Illusive logic. Can the mind of man know the mind of God? Can a computer break the code and reveal all the secrets of the secret schools? Are The Templars trying to stop the Revelation? What is The Password? I cannot reveal the structure of the story, because They are coming for m alfk;lhag'[`ppjjjjjjj

Grok the Fullness of Understanding--Explore your Mind....with this Epic Tome of Literary Achievement! This book has inspired millions of minor philosophers and armchair psychologists, anthropologists and other trouble-makers. This wonderful novel is cram-packed with subtle innuendo and blatant facts about the human condition and our Struggle to Grasp reality, religion, science and sexuality. Oh, yes.... You will learn to Grok the fullness of your life potential, if you read the underlying story. I am a &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land.&quot; You probably are, also, if you are reading these words. We are all outcasts and misfits, trying to find our place in the Universe...like the protagonist of this work of &quot;fiction.&quot; If your favorite Sci-Fi/ Fantasy-lover, Egghead or &quot;Trouble-Maker&quot; finds this one under the tree, they will give you a full grokking of the state of being know as Happiness. This novel is a great way of subtly introducing Psychology, Anthropology and Sociology into your Teen-ager's life, as well. This book is a CLASSIC and should be given much respect, for it was way ahead of it's time...which is probably the reason for the release of &quot;The Original Uncut&quot; version, circa 1991.

This is a fascinating introduction to Voodoo / Hoodoo, with practical application of various techniques--spells, curses, folk magick--for anyone interested in the subject.This book provides a very subtle, yet exciting introduction to Southern style Voodoo / Hoodoo (not the Religion of "Voodou").I read this book in one sitting, and could not put it down. This small coffee-table style book is packed with short spells and stories that explain the subject in a very concise and entertaining manner. At-first, it seems like the book & voodoo doll is a quaint gift set, but the feel of the book and the writings within are inspiring and conducive to comprehending a general overview of Southern Voodoo / Hoodoo.New Orleans style Voodoo is the foundation of the book and it contains a brief introduction to many aspects of Voodoo / Hoodoo.Aside from the great Spells, I particularly enjoyed the section about reading Playing Cards as Tarot cards. Historically, "playing cards" derived from Tarot cards, so this is quite practical. The meanings of each card, in a typical card deck are given, listing the correspondences, per each suit.If you enjoy the section about playing cards as much as I did, you can purchase the following beautiful standard deck to begin using the techniques, per Doktor Snake....then, work your way up to the correspondences in the lovely book that comes with the card deck: "The Fortune Teller's Deck: Predict Your Future With Playing Cards," by Jane Lyle (ISBN # 0312136684). This deck has a particularly good feel and look for a Gypsy or Voodoo / Witchcraft practitioner--with an Antiqued style.Keep in mind that "Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook: Spells, Curses and Folk Magic for All Your Needs," by Doktor Snake, is a general overview of the subject and a personal account thereof....yet, it is a fascinating little book, packed with Spells, ideas, stories, inspiration and is well-worth the price.I am very pleased with this book and it inspired me to research further. However, if you want in-depth research, I suggest "Voodou Visions." Don't pass-up Doktor Snake's book, though--it is worth owning just for the "playing card" Tarot correspondences!

Aside from the joking &quot;mistake&quot; on page 3, this book is a fantastic and well-written, concise, thorough explanation of Algebra, in Terms that do not fry your logic circuits.I am not entirely sure if someone could Teach Themselves Algebra, completely, with this book, but it is a Wonderful Refresher Course. Personally, I had to set College aside for a few years, due to working all the time. When my schedule finally became stable and reasonable, I realized two years had disappeared. So, I used this Study Guide to get myself back up to speed. Sure, I had all of my old notes, tests, quizzes and whatnot, but this book relieved the stress of matching-up chapters to notes and deciphering scribbled notes taken at light-speed. I simply sat-down with this practical study guide for several evenings and weekends, before diving back into college courses.This book helped jog my memory and get me back on track, quickly. It seems the Perfect choice for refreshing the Memory Chips, between High School and College--esp., for those who haven't had an Algebra course for several years.My synopsis of this great study guide is:This is a quick, Painless, way to Learn Algebra and Refresh your memory for college courses, or to use as a helpful study guide along with the College Texts and notes from class.This book is especially good for people who spend most of their time working, or studying for on-the-job certifications, as well as college courses. I assume it would be great for High School Students, as well.

The History of Freemasonry is clouded with time, personal prejudice, suppression and many other factors. Yet, men like Mackey lay the paver-stones for the path of self-discovery amongst Masons. He gave many years of his life to this research and the book is well-worth every year he spent in dusty libraries, to produce this work. The beginnings of this book contain very archaic language, but the struggle is worth the time given to study. It seems that most books are a variation of this material, or refer to this material. Whether it is &quot;the definitive history of Freemasonry,&quot; or not, is up to debate.... However, it is hard to appreciate NEW findings, without refering to books such as this one, to understand how much of the mass-market material is &quot;accurate&quot; or, at-least, Inspired-by well-documented research. I would expect to see this one on every Mason's bookshelf, but Anyone can appreciate the complex &quot;History of Freemasonry.&quot;

This film will draw you in and hold you. I admit, I bought it because Salma Hayek stars in the film. Later, my ex-wife (also an Artist) reminded me that &quot;Frida Kahlo&quot; was one of her biggest Inspirations (not in style, but as a role-model).Salma Hayek did an astounding job of recreating the person and world of Frida Kahlo. I was so impressed by this film, that I actually took the time to watch the &quot;making of&quot; section of the DVD--which I strongly suggest viewing, as well as the film, itself.I loved this film so much, I also purchased a copy for my ex-wife--as a Birthday present. This would be a great gift for all Artistic people--especially women--however, it would also be a great gift for people who are Challenged by various handicaps.Frida Kahlo certainly persevered through many challenges and personal traumas, but did not give-up. I can see why she would be an amazing Role Model for young women!

This Compelling movie brings much Understanding to the concept of &quot;Life After Death&quot; and gives us a few clues about how to get-around when we do not have bodies, anymore! This movie also shows that you do not just Quit doing all of the things you love...you simply have a Lot More Time to do them! If you have ever questioned dogmatic beliefs or had &quot;Lucid&quot; dreams that foretold an After-Life that contradicts what you have been led to believe...this movie is for you. If you are a person who seeks Knowledge about Spirituality, this movie is a great addition to your personal collection of images, data and theories. Or....if you are just a Romantic person, who enjoys a Great Love Story! Get your box of tissues ready and delve into this Highly Under-rated film. I would give it 5 stars, if it were a little faster-paced...but, that's just my Opinion. Most women Love this film (and guys should give it a try)! &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; is difficult to find, where I live, so I wonder how many people know about this Great Movie. There are many surprising scenes in this film and I believe it should be considered a Classic.

I recommend this book to Everyone interested in Masonry or Anti-Masonry--esp., to those joining The Craft (see the Dedication of the book) &amp; their loved ones. John J Robinson gives a well-written appraisal of Freemasonry and the Anti-Masonic Propagandists, who slander the organization. Everything he says can easily be backed-up with a little research &amp; this book is a concise, sensible, articulate piece of research material that sums-up most of the important aspects of Freemasonry.... and the unfortunate, ridiculous attacks by the Uninitiated. A Great &quot;coffee table&quot; book for Freemasons. Buy one for your Church and loan it to those who are confused by the evangelists and other money-mongers. My Credentials? : I made my decision to join The Freemasons long-ago, not knowing if I would be found worthy... and not knowing anyone of my generation who had joined this organization, that I admired so-much. As I sought methods of joining the fraternal order, I stumbled-across a cornucopia of information about Freemasonry. I was distressed to discover that Anti-Masonic propaganda was being used by various groups to further the ignorance of various causes. I read everything I could get my hands on about The Masons, for many years, because of my great respect for them. I know many Masons, in other states, and my family--The Lincolns--have been affiliated with Masonic orders for generations, but my Grandfather kept all of his secrets.... My Grandmother was in The Order of the Eastern Star, and so was my Great-Grandmother (a VERY religious, Christian woman). I am also a member of a Humanitarian organization that has always attracted Freemasons and is based on Masonic Principles. My experience with Masonry has made me a better man and I have seen nothing (Despite the Propaganda) that would make me think any less of Freemasonry. -- &quot;A Pilgrim's Path&quot; is a book that could have saved me ten years of research and helped me to teach others, along the way, without saying a word..... However, my research has led me to the conclusion that Mr. Robinson is very knowledgeable and I recommend his book, because I admire his work and his writing skills. I believe this book will be adopted as a Masonic Handbook for those joining or interested in the Freemasons. Women want to know more about The Masons and this book is for them, as well!

I recently began taking Ashtanga Yoga classes and I firmly believe, after only a few sessions, that Ashtanga Yoga is Very Beneficial to the Body and the mind. After one session, your body begins to tighten-up. After two sessions, you feel Great!I am only a beginner, but I intend to pursue this form of Yoga for the rest of my life. This form of Yoga makes you feel Wonderful and puts you in-tune with your body, very quickly. However, it is rather Complicated &amp; this Instructional Book is Perfect for anyone involved in this practice. In fact, one of the students in my class brought the book and the teacher used the pictures for demonstration purposes. She is a Professional and she recommends this book.The positions are all layed-out in-detail, via sketches and (mostly) Pictures. This is an elegant book and it is Very Reasonably priced!I would strongly suggest taking a few classes to begin and learn the techniques properly, but this book will help you immensely in your studies ! If you cannot afford classes or you live in a small town, this book, in combination with a quick Search of the Web, for &quot;Ashtanga Yoga&quot; will get you going (just make-sure to read all the safety issues and proper practices, first).

Elizabeth Hurley is absolutley Incredible as The Devil. I'm glad The Devil never came to me, dressed like this! Hang onto your souls Boys 'n Girls.... She defines the word &quot;Temptation.&quot;Brendan Fraser is terrific, as a Geeky guy who just wants to have some friends and a certain girl that makes his heart flutter.... His adventures begin with a wish that sends him on a transformational quest (and, oh, how Funny those transformations are!). I watched it, first, at the movie theater, on the big screen...mesmerized by the story and the special effects. I do not want to spoil anything, so I will simply say this: I smiled throughout the entire film! When I left the theater, I had a big, goofy grin plastered on my face....

This is without question the most Impressive book on the subject of The Qabalah, that I have encountered. Most books simply allude to Qabalistic knowledge and explain the devices used in the system; Gematria, Temura, Notariquon, etc.--but, 777 is a Compilation of decades of research, by a Dedicated Qabalist. I cannot possibly say I know enough about the Qabalah to give an educated review of 777, but, I do know this book contains more information, than any other book I have owned on the subject. It looks like a lifetime study, from what little I know--and, this seems to be the best place to start the Journey.To learn the Paths and to see Illustrations of the Qabalah, I recommend studying the following book in conjunction with "777"; "Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4," by Aleister Crowley (ISBN: 0877289190). I have recently been studying this book, with great results. A picture is worth a thousand words. The labeled Diagrams truly help the Student understand the subject.I also suggest purchasing a copy of "Paths of Wisdom," by John Michael Greer (ASIN: 1567183158), if you can find a copy. This book is especially useful to Students of the Mysteries, who have no teacher / organization.

As someone often mistaken for a woman, and as an Anthropologist, I highly recommend this wonderful, whimsical, Enlightened view of the Society vs. Gender dilemma.People often do not realize that a person must read stacks and stacks of books, to even come-close to comprehending WHY Gender is such a Big Deal in most cultures (especially American culture, which is extremely Repressed and dysfunctional).I have been asking myself Gender-related questions since I was a small child. Unfortunately, being raised in an environment that precluded the possibility of asking my parents any questions, or talking about such things in any other circumstances, all I had were Books.Obviously, Kate has read her fair share of books, magazines, Psychological arguments (I mean views), etc. Luckily, she wrote about her research, personal experiences, the challenges involved with living "Alternative Lifestyles" and society's response to people dropping out of the tribe....The most inspiring and interesting concept I found in this work, was the idea that "Gender" is a "Tribal" concept. If you do not act the way your Tribe ("Male," "Female" / "Man," "Woman") WANTS you to act, you get kicked-out.I enjoy studying Anthropology and this concept makes more sense than a lot of the other theories I have read.When Kate puts things into perspective, and shows (easily) that the Man Tribe vs. Woman Tribe theory is in-action every day, in most cultures....it is like a Revelation.When you read this book, you realize that Males act as-if they are a Phallic Cult & Females act as-if they are a Non-phallic Cult. Both Cults struggle to preserve their Born adherents and Demand they remain in the Cult of their birth (much like someone being born into a Religious Cult, from-which you cannot escape).As I read Kate's book, I thought, "She should be writing Text books and Psychology papers....Anthropological Research."It is wonderful to see someone bucking the System and providing an Insider's view of the Struggle between the Sexes.I believe that if more people were honest with themselves, the Crime Rate, Depression, Homophobia, and numerous other Cultural Ignorance Factors would be reduced, phenomenally."Gender Outlaw" is a great start to educating the masses.Gender issues have been confused, ridiculed, demonized and otherwise caused much unnecessary Grief for far too long. Patriarchal society has given us a Goofball, uneducated view of what Gender is, how it works, & WHY we are the way we are."Gender Outlaw" is a fresh, new perspective on Gender issues, and it is written in a humorous, easy to digest format.Personally, I miss the 80's. It seems, people were a lot happier when they were Androgynous.

This Haunting flick is a Bluesy Classic that never leaves your mind. Scenes remain permanently lodged in your data banks and influence your opinion of other noir films. How could anyone compare to DeNiro, in this role ? Rouke is very convincing as an archetypal &quot;down and out detective&quot; and brings a special feel to the character that only he could deliver. There are many cliche' scenarios in this film, but I can't recall anything that surpasses &quot;Angel Heart's&quot; version of &quot;detective thriller, with a twist.&quot; I hate when people spoil a movie, so I'll refrain from revealing the plot, yet I encourage everyone to explore this Psychological Detective story for themselves. The characters are superb and Lisa Bonet got in a lot of hot water over the sexual scenes.... Confront your inner demons and explore the human capacity for evil.

The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. His books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. However, there is much more to Tolkien than many people realize. His translations and teaching positions are not always mentioned, yet they are credentials that make his other works even more astounding! The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Before I became interested in Freemasonry &amp; before studying Mystery School works, when I was a teenager....just-after being booted out of home for having an earring and hair below collar-length....a friend talked with me about my natural psychic abilities and loaned me &quot;The Occult,&quot; by Colin Wilson. This book left a great impression on me and I have always remembered and appreciated this work. Also, this book introduced me to Numerology &amp; opened my thinking in other areas. The various characters involved in The Occult are discussed, throughout the book and...if I remember correctly...I believe there are pictures of famous occultists in Black and White. I have never owned a copy of this book, but the copy I borrowed changed hands so many times that I can assure it's value as a good read.... I think Wilson did a great job with what he knew at the time.

The Brotherhood of Light Tarot is one of the many decks in the world that has the 8 & 11 reversed (e.g., "The Thoth Deck"). It is not the easiest to use, because the cards are produced in Black and White (explained below) and the Lesser Arcana have minimal symbolism.... The Black & White rendering of the deck is for the purpose of the Initiate gaining a deeper contact with the cards and learning the symbolism & color-relationship of each aspect of the card by RESEARCHING and studying the texts....and coloring them, by hand (which I do not advise, until you study Tarot--esp., "The Sacred Tarot," by C.C. Zain. THE MAJOR ARCANA are wonderful--very Unique ! You will treasure this deck, even if you do not connect with it until you have read a few books and gained a firm ground upon-which to draw info from the Inner Plane. This is mostly a deck for initiates of the BofL.

Eddie Murphy was right, us white folks are stupid. Mr. Murphy said that white folks will buy a house even if it is haunted... And it is almost always the white folks going down vacant roads in the middle of nowhere, blatantly declaring their right to do so. The driver of the family in this movie is an arsehole; if he were alone, I'd cheer him on.However the entire family is at the mercy of the idiot in the driver's seat, so I want to jump into the scene and say, "turn around!" Yet that would take the action, suspense, and Intensity out of the movie. If the characters ever listened to me there would be nothing to scare people.Because no one convinces the idiot to turn around, all hell breaks loose, and everyone is stranded with mutant psychopaths who seem to find us white folks tasty.This movie is freaky, bizarre, suspenseful, and horrific.Wolf Creek (Unrated) [HD DVD] only has one Psycho, but this flick is full of 'em ! One word: Intense.

House of Flying Daggers has Beautiful Cinematography, Choreography, and a great story! Most reviewers have already covered the basics, but I wanted to give a 5 star rating to this masterful film.This is movie to treasure, and if you enjoy this film as much as I do....Also, purchaseHero. For those who somehow missedCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I suggest adding that to your wish list, as well.I was only slightly interested in martial arts films, untilCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonwas created, butHouse of Flying DaggersandHerohave expanded my interests. These movies are truly masterful productions, and they have inspired many other beautiful films. This genre is unique and highly recommended.

This album was and is one of the most important works, in it's field, ever released. In fact, when this group made it big, they immediately reverted to THIS album for their stage performance, which I have read was unbelievable...like Geoff Tate's voice and the guitar work, et al. &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; is not just another Rock album--it is a journey into the world of Religious Fanaticism, Catholicism, human suffering, tragic love, drug addiction and Politics. There is more truth in this &quot;Rock-Opera&quot; than many people can handle. I have also owned the video, which gives a great visual representation of the story and an idea of what those historical concerts must-have been like. There are songs that seem purely late-eighties, with heavy and/or intricate guitar work, yet there are very ethereal and haunting songs as well. The entire album is a flowing story, not just seperate songs placed in a compilation for marketing purposes. Queensryche put an enormous amount of effort into the production and stage performances of &quot;Operation: Mindcrime.&quot; You may see things in a new light. If I had to categorize this one, I'd place it in &quot;Intellectual Rock.&quot;

When I read this one, back in High School, I was so completely enthralled that I could not stop reading--despite other responsibilities. The journey of Wil Ohmsford, as he guards the Elven girl Amberle, while being pursued by the ultimate Demon... and trying to prevent a tear in the magickal fortifications that keep the Demon Forces on the OTHER side...is hair-raising adventure! You will pray that they make it through, and accomplish their goals. This one proves certain fanatics wrong--fantasy is not inspired by the dark forces--in fact, it proves that faith is necessary in attempting to over-come Darkness. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment. His writing is very enticing...his words draw you into the story, and you cannot escape his world. Tolkien got me through Middle school and Terry Brooks helped me survive High School, although I must admit I read Tolkien again and again--however, Terry Brooks is the only author I feel that I can mention beside the name of the master. This novel is not a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; nock-off, it is completely original. If you are looking for copy-cat stories, you should look else-where--although, the series does contain some of the same creatures and humanoids (sort-of), they are very original and exciting. I agree with the Future scenario, because of certain buildings and such that are encountered during the journey....our world devastated and rebuilt with Magick. One aspect of Brook's series that I feel very attracted to is the character Allanon, a Druid that sleeps for centuries or decades and awakens when he is needed. I have always felt a strong connection with this character.... Interestingly, this mysterious character guards a secret Storehouse of Knowledge and strives to save humankind from the Demonic Forces that want the world to live in Ignorance and Despair.

This book is not the most well-written or well-researched book I have ever read...but, it is essential reading for understanding Anti-Masonry and Conspiracy Theory. Although the author does a botch-up job on researching the Masons, and the book is written from a Myopic viewpoint, it does give the reader a good understanding of where the fundamentalists and propagandists are coming-from. One should not read this book without also reading &quot;Unholy Worship?&quot; by Steven Dafoe and &quot;A Pilgrim's Path,&quot; by John J. Robinson to cleanse the mind. I must admit, I do not comprehend why the author is so distressed about the concept of the world coming-together, in Union with one-another.... He seems to completely contradict himself, by preaching Christianity, yet preaching against Unification at the same time. I thought Christianity was based on unification and Brotherly love. Well...at-least he was right about the &quot;new money.&quot; :)

You might detect a bit of Jack Sparrows, for a moment, in Sheldon Jeffrey Sands. I love this movie. The trailers enticed me with Salma Hayek, and I had lovedDesperado (Special Edition). Therefore I caught this on the big screen, then rented it...then I knew I had to purchase the film.Oddly, I rooted for Antonio Banderas all throughoutEl Mariachi (Special Edition),Desperado (Special Edition), and the beginning ofOnce Upon a Time in Mexico...then along came Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.Although I must fault Sheldon Jeffrey Sands for allowing his ego to overwhelm his good judgment, and his nether regions to overrule his brainpan, he is the man. A bit too smug, his Ego sometimes screws up his plans. Yet I am hoping for a comeback.If they want us to root for "the good guy," they can't make "the bad guy" so damned cool. You just have to see the movie, and watch how SJS sets things up to watch them fall. You can purchase the trilogy:Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico). I am hoping for a part four.

Deepak Chopra changed my views about &quot;self-help&quot; tapes and books. Most of what I have heard or seen advertised, by others, has been very goofy or pretentious.... Deepak, however, is not your usual fare. This man is an EDUCATED, Medical-minded, Spiritual, Philosophical genius. He explains Quantum Theories in a way that children can appreciate, as well as those who don't listen to Feynman tapes or delve into other Deep-Thinking ares. This man is Brilliant, yet he does not &quot;go over your head.&quot; He is there to help you see the light...which shines brightly from his work. Chopra's tapes and books reveal much knowledge that has been suppressed and/or ignored for centuries. His work with Wayne Dyer is fun and jam-packed with life-altering views and helpful hints, all backed with psychological, medical and LIFE-Experience research. You will not listen to this tape once or twice and misplace the tape--however, you might loan it to a great friend (that will give it back to you!)--you will find yourself listening to his work often. You will learn something new, each time you play the tapes. Journey Into the Boundless is one of my favorites. A friend loaned the set to me and now I want my own copy! I believe this man's work is so important that I feel obligated to purchase a copy and share snipets with friends. Anyone interested in Spirituality, Healing or Physics would love Deepak Chopra! I cannot say enough good things about this man and his work. His voice is soothing and his words are enlightening. This is money well-spent, and the thought-provoking, intellectual material is priceless!

I thought I had reviewed this, long-ago. Perhaps, I hit the wrong button. I very Highly recommend this Biography of Crowley. This book led me to an English class project in college about Poets affiliated with occult orders, which will take me many years to research and finish. Kaczynski's fascinating portrayal of the life of Crowley and the famous (and infamous) people he was associated with is exciting reading. I could not put the book down. I treasure my signed copy, along with the rest of my research collection, but this Biography stands-out from many other Crowley bios because the Author has the collegiate background and Access to fully research the subject. His approach was very honest, even when not favorable to Crowley. It is good to read the other bios for different perspectives, but "Perdurabo" is the Crowley biography I always recommend most frequently, and at the "top of the list."

These &quot;Inspired&quot; writings of Aleister Crowley--aka, Master Therion--are compiled into &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; for the studious Thelemite.Most of this material will not make a lick of sense to anyone who is not a Thelemite, and doubtfully makes much sense to any Thelemite who hasn't read a stack or two of Crowley's other writings. However, once you have read a dozen or two Crowley books, &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; start to make some kind of sense.....Fair warning, I have been informed that &quot;The Uninitiated&quot; won't &quot;get it&quot; until they have been Initiated into one of Crowley's various Magickal systems.So, &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; is a great resource for Thelemites, but even Thelemites probably will not understand most of the material, until they have been &quot;enlightened&quot; by one of the Magickal groups (O.T.O., Thelemic Golden Dawn, etc.).&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; contains all the &quot;Inspired&quot; (presumably by entities outside of Crowley's head) works of Thelema, and a break-down of the writings on &quot;The Stele' of Revealing&quot;--which is integral to the writing of &quot;The Book of The Law&quot;).&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; is a convenient resource, containing all the information prospective &quot;Thelemites&quot; need to get started on the Thelemic Path.It has been suggested that a Thelemite should reread this material after each Initiation, to fully comprehend the material.

First, let me say that this is my new Favorite Movie !I hereby Absolve John Waters for making &quot;Pink Flamingos.&quot; He has redeemed himself, with this movie, and all sins are forgiven.Seriously, &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; is destined to be not-only a Cult Classic, but a hit amongst the younger generations. The characters are fascinating and the non-stop Action keeps your attention focused from beginning to The End. Even the opening credits will grab your attention! I am very glad I purchased this movie, because I know I will watch it many times--which is not the norm, for me. A movie must be very well-made for me to watch it twice.I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie and there are so many things I would love to mention, but I don't want to ruin the Surprises! The only problem I had with the movie was the way the Police were portrayed....I had a hard time buying that. Yet, if you think of it in context of a social statement, it will not trouble you.ALL Movie Fans &amp; Buffs (especially Cult film lovers) need this movie. This is a movie MADE for people who Love movies.... perhaps, too much.The actors are perfect for their parts, Waters is a genius.

This book proves, to me, that most of what I have read about Crowley, previously, was filtered through the Lens of Prejudice.I did not start reading Crowley's works, until recently, due to his reputation and the fact that I had read much negative information about him, from the time I was a child (my Grandfather owned &quot;An Index of Possibilities: Energy and Power,&quot; which I inherited). Most of my Opinions and Views of Crowley were created by reading the works of Colin Wilson, Nevill Drury, etc.However, when I started reading Crowley's own words....I saw a different man. In fact, I can no longer believe the accusations of him being mentally unstable at the end of his life.&quot;Magick Without Tears&quot; was written in the last years of Crowley's life, when other writers say A.C. was nuttier than a fruitcake. Yet, if you read this book, you will quickly realize he was completely Sound of Mind, Educated, Well-Spoken (or written, I should say) and quite Articulate. He obviously retained an enormous wealth of Knowledge in his own mind--only referencing books when necessary. There is no doubt that his mental faculties were still in Prime Condition. In fact, even his crankiness was tinted with a Humorous Quality that made him rather endearing. He writes the way the old guys I hang-out with Act....cranky, yet always suppressing a Mischievous grin playing on their lips &amp; their eyes dancing with boyish light.Yes, he was a bit Eccentric...but, he seems to wish he had not been quite so Erratic--so that people would-have taken him a bit more seriously. His introversion was displaced by Forced Extroversion, leading him to act over the top many times when, perhaps, it would have been best for him to remain a Poet, instead of a &quot;Beast.&quot;The Contents of &quot;Magick without Tears&quot; prove that the Contents of his mind were a Storehouse of Hidden Knowledge and highly sophisticated schooling--enough-so, to challenge any Professor.The thing I find most Interesting and Amazing about this book is Crowley's Anthropological Insight into Humanity! I am a student of Anthropology and I never imagined I would find such a wealth of Anthropological Research in the works of Crowley--a man accused of being a Scoundrel and worse, by other writers.I must say, I have seen more common-sense in the writings of Crowley, than I have in most of the Text books and religious books I have read. I think, perhaps, the reason he was so Ostracized is because he told the Blatant Truth about humanity and people's wishes, desires, behavior, et al.The rest of Society wanted to sweep their &quot;faults&quot; under the carpet and hide them in the closet--but, Crowley wanted to be Honest and Celebrate these truly Human and NORMAL desires.I believe someone should bestow an Honorary Anthropology Phd on Aleister Crowley. He makes more sense than most supposedly &quot;educated&quot; men on the subject of the Human Condition.I could not put this book down--literally...I carried it around the house, reading whenever I got a chance. I strongly suggest this collection of Crowley's writings to anyone interested in the subjects of Crowley, Magick, Anthropology, Psychology, History or Religion.This book taught me a lesson: &quot;Do your Own Research.&quot;

Do yourself a favor and read-up on Yoga, Witchcraft, and Occultism...then, read this book of Excellent Magickal Instruction. I understood it because I have been delving into Hinduism and I have studied Paganism/Witchcraft. Crowley writes, as usual, for the Experienced, not the Beginner.This is a small book, yet it has more information than most thick tomes of &quot;occult&quot; knowledge. There is nothing &quot;fluffy&quot; about &quot;Book 4.&quot; Crowley supplies us with a concise record of the Basics of Magick, without embellishing or beating around the bush....of course, this is *his* version of Magickal Practice--with a strong resemblance to Witchcraft--yet, this work is not representative of Witchcraft, itself.For the serious student, this work is very informative--combining Yoga Techniques with other Magickal Practices.

....And Gaining Ground in all areas of their Enterprise. Michael Corleone is now The Godfather and he is &quot;doing business&quot; to open new frontiers and Respectability for &quot;The Family.&quot; This man is so Driven and Intense (could anyone-else have played him?), that he is willing to risk everything, including his own life, to advance the Family Name. There are scenes in this movie that truly make you wonder how Al Pacino could-have created such Intensity and Perfection in his facial expressions. It is so Real, you will forget you are watching a movie. He will scare you, once, and you will not forget the expression on his face. I hang-around Theater People and live with an Actress.... I believe Al Pacino is a Great Actor, unlike any other. Everything about this man is pure genius. You will feel his pain and you will share his emotions. I strongly suggest buying Godfather III, or you will be left in a very awkward state at the end of the film. However, give it a night to soak-in, then watch the Godfather III--which will take you from the end of II all the way to The Vatican. Godfather II is an intense Portrayal of Michael's struggle to &quot;become legitimate&quot; and bring Honor to his Family's name.... Brando is back, in a &quot;retired&quot; capacity and we get a great look at the inner family life of the New Godfather. This movie begins in a very dark, dreary way...but, hang in there...because Robert DeNiro is introduced as &quot;Vito&quot; (the original Godfather/Brando character) in his younger years. We get to watch his rise from exiled Sicilian, living in 1901 New York, working for punitive wages in a Gang-Controlled neighborhood, to a man who takes-back his neighborhood and slowly evolves into &quot;The Godfather.&quot; One scene, in this film, is so unforgettable that it is will stick with you, forever! You will be mesmerized by Vito's rise to the top, intermingled with Michael's continuing struggle with power and personal demons. This movie does not have the fun and cajolery of the first and third film of the series, but it is in-tune with Michael's state-of-mind (Power-Trip ?). Get them ALL, so you can appreciate all of the many flavors....and buy some Italian food to fix-up, because this series will make you crave Italian food while you are engrossed in the story. Make Garlic Bread &amp; Lasagna or Spaghetti (etc.) at intermission. This is a Weekend thing...so be prepared.

In this one,"The Family" concentrates on Retaining Wealth and Political Power...and Gaining Ground in all areas of their Enterprise. Michael Corleone is now The Godfather and he is "doing business" to open new frontiers and Respectability for "The Family."

Our man, Ben Holiday, ruler of a magickal kingdom, finds even more problems to solve in his new world...like, for instance, staying alive. The novel begins at breakfast, with a dream and escalates from there....entangled with more twists and turns than a roller-coaster, so hang-loose and enjoy the ride. I like the girl who turns into a tree. After reading the Shannara series, you may need a little comic relief. &quot;Magic Kingdom For Sale&quot; has the same great writing style, but less Intensity.... you won't feel so nervous about the main characters and the quest is more like your own life--how the heck am I going to straighten this mess out? What did I get myself into? --except for the fact that your friends are not quite human and your world is completely new...and you have more responsibility than you ever imagined, just when you thought you were FINALLY going to get a break...and then this Dark Lord character wants to take-over everything and.... Oh, read the story! This series is more at-home on the shelf beside &quot;The Hitch-hiker's Guide,&quot; than the Shannara series. You'll love it!

The previews and hype for this film made me think that the pace would be faster, but the pace is just right for this film. I was genuinely surprised by some twists in the plot, and I became an M. Night Shyamalan fan because of this film. I recommend searching for his other films, as well.I see some negative ratings, but I do like this movie and I appreciate the concepts, style, and meaning of the film.The suspense and tension in this film build until the revelations at the end. Some people may not like the climax, but I see the end as fitting and unique.

I work in the IT / Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals who have little familiarity with The Internet and all the intricacies of email, firewalls, modems, Instant Messaging, etc.This book is very, very Basic..., yet I can guarantee you, as a Help-Desk Agent, that many adults (including myself) can gather useful information from this book. The old saying is true: &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot; In this book, that is mostly what you get...a lot of illustrations.There is much reiteration of the same material throughout the book, which creates Filler, but the Illustrations are very helpful to the average beginning Internet user.This book is not designed to be the Ultimate Internet Guide, but it IS a wonderful book to read through and donate to your local library, or to give your parents or grandparents to help them understand the Wonderful World of the Web.Most people generally tend to forget that not everyone is hip to the Internet technology and terminology. This book caters to individuals who are struggling to incorporate all this new-fangled gadgetry into their lives. I wouldn't recommend this book to Techs, but I would certainly recommend it to anyone trying to integrate with the rest of society, online.

R.A.W. is my new favorite Writer. This man is a Genius. He is so far ahead of his time, that he will be Immortalized with Einstein, Crowley, etc. Robert Anton Wilson is one of the very few writers I have experienced, who sees through the smokescreens and delves into the mysteries, with a SMI(2)LE on his face &lt;g>R.A.W. does not take himself too seriously, nor does he take society, government, religion or Secret Societies too seriously. This is one of the most Humorous books I have read recently--however, it will only be funny to those with a fairly decent knowledge base of; Physics, Quantum Physics, The Occult, Anthropology, Psychology, Secret Societies, Conspiracy Theories (see R.A.W.'s "Everything is Under Control"), and a good understanding of the fact that we are, indeed, living on "The Planet of The Apes."R.A.W. hit the nail on the head, with his theory that we are "Domesticated Primates" --look around, and read the news.The Essays, articles, quotes, reading lists, poetry, Scientific/Psychological breakdowns of the situation Domesticated Primates have gotten themselves into is fascinating and makes more sense than most of the theories circulating in the media, schools, etc.I am studying Anthropology, and I have always studied various religions and Psychology...and I find "The Illuminati Papers" to be a revealing and important book to be circulated among the Eggheads. Most folks will not like it, because Americans do not read much and this book will make them feel inadequate. However, many people will "get it" and they will treasure this Tome of Wisdom."The Illuminati Papers" contains wonderful articles, essays, etc.--such as "The Abolition of Stupidity," "Quantum Mechanics as a Branch of Primate Psychology," "An Incident on Cumberland Avenue," "Beyond Theology: The Science of Godmanship," "Stupidynamics" & "Hey, man, are you only using half of your brain?"This book seems small and appears to be a "quick read." However, this is a book that will often have you thinking more than reading. I often found myself wandering back to the pages, after some paragraph or line triggered a series of thoughts that carried me away into Contemplation for a while. I was astounded that I did not finish it in one or two sittings. This is definitely a Thinking person's book. I would raise a suspicious eyebrow at anyone who reads through it, swiftly....or look for Diplomas on their walls, stating that they are a Physicist, Neurologist, or Psychologist.... or, perhaps, a "Super Anthropologist." :-)

The Heroine somehow manages to disguise herself as a boy and live amongst seamen without them catching-on.... leading to very precarious predicaments on-board the ship, down in the dark below-deck regions.The journey across the sea, into unchartered(?) waters is plagued with daily near-disasters, Deception and laborious drudgery--spiked with moments of panic, Romance and religious epiphanies from The Goddess.Behind the Heroine's personal adventure, is an underlying conspiratorial background of espionage and power plays relating to the shadowy plots of individuals and organizations loosely based upon "Templar" societies. Historically, The Templars were International Sailors and the author has incorporated this fact into the story....which leads to The New World.Is the Heroine doomed to the Inquisition's Torments....or, is she destined to be a Representative of The Goddess ?Is she a wealthy Lady on the run...or a Swan Goddess, fallen to earth?Will she survive the Journey...or perish in the Sea ?

There is nothing more important than your Family.... What would you do to Support them? What would you do to Provide for them? How can you Protect them...from the Evils of the world? Decisions, Decisions.... See how one man's Decisions lead to the creation of a &quot;Family&quot; of organized men who are at-odds with Society, The Police, The FBI...and each-other. A World within our world, yet completely outside of it--a world you cannot enter, unless you can drop the right name. I remember snippets of this film, from TV airings, as a teenager. Those images, saved in a backlog file in my brain, never really inspired me to rent this film. However, recent conversations led to me purchasing this movie and viewing it with Rapt Attention! I had no idea! The TV commercials for the movie did not do it justice. I thought it would be a long, slow, boring flick that you just sit-through to say you have seen it. WRONG ! This movie is Action-packed, from beginning to end! I had to rewind scenes and watch them Twice! Could Anyone have played The Godfather, other-than Brando (and, later, DeNiro)? I cannot imagine anyone-else playing this role.... Another review said that these people were born to play these parts. I agree. You will get lines stuck in your head, that you cannot unthink: &quot;Leave the Gun....Take the Cannoli.&quot; You will also understand movies like &quot;Robinhood, Men in Tights.&quot; I've watched that movie twice, never understanding the Dom DeLouise scene, until I watched The Godfather. This movie is not-only a Classic, it is an EXCITING Classic. Please, do not make my mistake, though! Get them ALL, before you start watching them! If you only get Godfather I, you will feel strangely compelled to run for the local video store, when the movie ends. Pile them all up and make a weekend of it. Godfather II is a little slow and dark, but is WELL-WORTH watching and Important for understanding III, which is Astounding. This series is definitely on my &quot;Top Ten&quot; List!

If you are looking for Great Books, by the most proficient and prolific authors of Astrology, Tarot, Numerology and related fields, do a search on Doris Chase Doane. She is a legend in her own time and is highly-respected by many well-informed and instructed Astrologers in the Nation and throughout the world. I purchased this book at an Astrologer's Convention in 1992 &amp; I have found it to be quite useful in the study of The Tarot. This is the only book that I have seen in the public domain (until recently), which has a Full depiction of The Brotherhood of Light Tarot cards. &quot;The Sacred Tarot,&quot; by C.C. Zain, has full-page illustrations of the Major Arcana of the B of L deck &amp; smaller representations of the Lesser Arcana...but, &quot;How to Read Tarot Cards&quot; includes illustrations of the Major and Minor Arcana in an easily-referrenced, consecutively-placed and described manor. This book is dedicated to &quot;all those brave souls, who, amidst enormous prejudice, have searched for, are investigating, and will continue to seek out the basic truths of nature's laws....&quot;

This is the Best Astrology book I have owned...several times... and the only one that never comes back to me. I do not suggest loaning this book to anyone. Make them buy it !This book is astoundingly Accurate and Soooooo much fun to research (to see if it *really* measures up). I have owned this book for a long time and discussed it with numerous individuals and couples. Everyone seems to agree that it is very Accurate and amazingly easy to comprehend or use.Most Astrology books are boring and unexplainable to "Non-Believers," but Sexual Astrology speaks for and proves itself.The advice in this work is sound, and very helpful in relationship matters. This book will certainly help you work things out, in a Polygamous relationship ;)

Since discovering Yoga and it's benefits, I have begun the practice of Ashtanga Yoga, and I am also studying about Kriya and the "Self-Realization Foundation," founded by Paramahansa Yogananda ("Mejda"). I devoured the book, "Mejda," written by his brother & I am now devouring this book--his Autobiography. I am so excited about this book that I could not even wait to finish it, before trying to get the word out!If you are a person who is always striving to find Knowledge, or you are a Mystical person who is struggling to understand the World, the Mysteries or Spirituality, this book is calling your name. I have always been fascinated by Deepak Chopra and men like him. Paramahansa Yogananda's story helps me to understand these Great Men and their Message.I cannot begin to explain how much I have enjoyed the story of Mejda's Journey and Spiritual Growth.I am very seriously considering the idea of joining SRF, because of this book & his brother's book, "Mejda."I see, from searching, that Paramahansa Yogananda has written MANY books. This makes me very happy. I know the story will not end for a long time!

I have been looking for this movie, since I saw it on Cable a few years ago. Where I live, I cannot locate the film (even in rental stores). Normally, I am not a big David Lynch fan--because, most of his films are dark, depressing, sick and leave you feeling emotionally drained or like your morals have been run through a cheese grater. However, with that preface, I would like to say that &quot;Zelly and Me&quot; is a wonderful movie! I was worried that it had been taken out of print, because it is so obscure. This is one of those rare films that really impact you in a way you can barely describe.... It is very difficult to explain to someone why they should acquire this film--it is a typical Lynch flick, because it is somewhat depressing and slow...but, it is Brighter and (dare I say?) almost cheerful in small doses! &quot;Zelly and Me&quot; does not really feel like a Lynch film, until the end is approaching (when you are too hooked to escape). It has been years, since I saw this great movie, and I still would very-much like to track Lynch down and tell him he cannot end the movie the way he did &lt;Legal Disclaimer: This is a joke, folks&gt;. You just sit there and stare at the TV, mumbling, &quot;He can't do that.... This isn't right.&quot; You will find the movie disturbing (it's Lynch), but not in the usual way. &quot;Zelly and Me&quot; is what I would call &quot;Profoundly Disturbing.&quot; The film makes you think....

Allanon, the keeper of the Keep (and all the Sacred Knowledge), returns from death to prevent yet-another attack of the insidious forces that always strive to destroy the Light. This novel is more true-to-life, than most fantasy novels, because the characters have serious obstacles to overcome that are not necessarily related to problems outside of themselves...they are a company of people suffering from various personal injuries and issues that make the main quest all that much more difficult. These are real heroes, that cannot simply stave-off an attack like it was nothing to them (like most fantasy writers portray the main characters) these are not super-heroes...they are ordinary people who strive to rise-above the challenges and escape the dangers at every turn. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment. His writing is very enticing...his words draw you into the story, and you cannot escape his world. Tolkien got me through Middle school and Terry Brooks helped me survive High School, although I must admit I read Tolkien again and again--however, Terry Brooks is the only author I feel that I can mention beside the name of the master. This novel is not a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; nock-off, it is completely original. If you are looking for copy-cat stories, you should look else-where--although, the series does contain some of the same creatures and humanoids (sort-of), they are very original and exciting. I agree with the Future scenario, because of certain buildings and such that are encountered during the journey....our world devastated and rebuilt with Magick. One aspect of Brook's series that I feel very attracted to is the character Allanon, a Druid that sleeps for centuries or decades and awakens when he is needed. I have always felt a strong connection with this character.... Interestingly, this mysterious character guards a secret Storehouse of Knowledge and strives to save humankind from the Demonic Forces that want the world to live in Ignorance and Despair.

I have spent ten years researching Freemasonry. My library is packed with Masonic and Anti-Masonic books. The most Succinct review of this book, in my opinion, is this: &quot;Dogmatic Drivel.&quot;If Ignorance is Bliss, this book is Utopia.... However, it IS a great book for understanding Anti-Masonry and the perpetuation of Ignorance--esp., because of religious Prejudice and Silliness.All of my research has led me to one conclusion about Freemasonry: I want to Join the Honorable Order...(and I will soon become a Mason, officially).Many Blessings Upon The Lodges of The World. -- GDL

Milla Jovovich is another of those actors who inspire me to watch whatever they are in. She was great inThe Fifth Element, and everything else I've seen her in;Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray]. However this film is not quite as intense as her usual butt kicking flicks.I would not sell my copy, and the cover alone is worth keeping, but I cannot give the film five stars. I like it, and Milla Jovovich is always sexy but the this is not on par with Resident Evil, etc. Regardless, you don't see my copy for sale on Amazon. ;-)

The major religions of the world must re-evaluate and re-investigate the legitimacy of the "Savior" Myth. This book could, literally, change the world. The concepts, premise &amp; information in this book is not-only a compilation of all the information The Church doesn't want you to know, but it is also a very well-written and honest approach to an age-old dilemma.I began questioning the Validity of the Jesus Myth, at the age of 12. I firmly and Honestly wanted to be "Saved and Baptized" at the age of 9, so I had a long talk on a Saturday afternoon, with our Baptist Preacher. He realized I knew what I was talking about and we had a great conversation. I was Baptized in June of '80. However, by the age of 12, I realized (after much Bible Study and Observation), that the Jesus Myth wasn't all it's cracked-up to be. I should have been in the Adult classes, but I was always told "that isn't how it works, you must wait until you are an Adult." Yet, I knew more than the Adults, so I studied on my own and lost all interest in Church.I stopped going to church at age 16-unless Forced to attend. I have only gone to churches for Weddings, during the last ten years, yet I have studied and read piles of books, during that time. I knew that most of the Jesus Myth is a collection of PRE-Christian religions and Myths Grafted onto a man who may or may not have lived....Yet, THIS BOOK made me believe in Jesus.After 10 years of research, this is the only thing I have read, including the Bible, that made me believe Jesus actually existed and walked the earth. I do not think many people could deny that he lived, after reading this Wonderfully Written book.However, I must concur with one of the chapter titles:&quot;The Truth will set you free....but, first, it may p--- you off.&quot;"Saving The Savior" is the only book I have read that presents a substantial case for the existence of the man whose name has been (slandered) used to butcher millions of people. After this book is on the market for a few years, there will be no more Inquisitions ! Fifty years ago, you would not have been allowed to read this book. Buy it now, before the Thought Police pull a 451 on it.

This is one of my favorite movies and one of the most well-produced on the market. I recommend reading &quot;Born In Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry,&quot; (John J. Robinson).... If you want the rest of the story.Mel Gibson does the memory and Legacy of William Wallace Justice and I cannot imagine the other important characters in this historical movie played by others. This movie is very well casted.

You will laugh until your sides hurt and you will rewind scenes two or three times ! This film is loaded with catchy phrases and scenes that keep popping into your thoughts and make you giggle, despite your attempts to think of something-else. You will never forget the Butler / House Boy....ever--&quot;Agadore Spartacus&quot; steals scene after scene, as (Robin Williams) struggles to maintain his sanity and composure, while fending-off Emotional Outbursts and Episodes of Self/Relationship Doubt from his transvestite Partner, (Nathan Lane). The plot revolves around &quot;their&quot; son getting married and not being able to deal with certain &quot;issues,&quot; concerning his &quot;parents.&quot; He is marrying (Alley McBeal), whose parents are Right-Wing Politicians.... thus, the &quot;Issues.&quot;I have seen &quot;The Birdcage&quot; many, many times &amp; I know children love the movie (they will watch it repeatedly). Couples will find lines from the film invading their daily conversations. When I watch it, with my girlfriend, we have weeks of fun from one viewing! This is just one of those fun-filled, hilarious films, that even homophobic men can't resist. You will laugh, Nathan Lane will cry....and you will do poor imitations of &quot;Agadore Spartacus&quot; for weeks afterward. Enjoy !

I found this book to be a very Compelling Introduction to the World of Enochian Magick. ... My brief encounter with the Enochian method impressed me and Lon Duquette's book encouraged my research--therefore, I purchased this Enochian Dictionary and found myself literally Devouring the introductory material (historical aspects, etc.) of "The Complete Enochian Dictionary: A Dictionary of the Angelic Language As Revealed to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley."I would certainly give the book 5 stars, if not for the fact that it is, mostly, a Dictionary / Reference book. I read the introductory material in one sitting, but the rest of the book is intended as reference material. However, this reference material is Brilliantly categorized as either original "Dee" words and definitions, or attributed to the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, Goetic, etc.--thus, creating a clearly defined listing of Original Enochian and that inspired by Crowley and his own workings with this system of Magick.... Regardless of the issues surrounding the historical creation (or revelation) of the Enochian Language, it seems to work. The words, of whatever origin, seem to produce a powerful effect upon the atmosphere surrounding the Magickian.I have not, personally, worked with Enochian, yet--I am only researching the effects I have witnessed, first-hand. From what I have seen, thus-far, I believe Enochian is, in fact, a powerful and Magickal Language.The origins of the language, although fascinatingly depicted in this book are moot--much like Gravitation and The Theory of Relativity, even if you do not understand the science behind it, it Works.I highly recommend this Dictionary of Enochian to anyone interested in Magick, Anthropology, The Occult, etc.--the subject is quite interesting.

Unlike some Vampire films, especially those focused upon Vampiric Lesbians, this movie actually has a story line. Everyone in the film has ulterior motives and their own psychological issues (worked out sexually).Originally, I rented this movie, because it looked "iffy," but I decided to purchase the film after viewing it once. This is a dark movie, and the characters play out dark fantasies. Definitely not a Vampire flick for the kids to watch. In fact, I bought it mostly because of the lesbian erotica scenes and "adult" scenes.I cannot give the movie five stars, but I had to own this movie rather than only renting it.

A discussion of Anthropology, History and Paganism led a friend to strongly recommend "American Gods" to me. When I purchased the book, I literally could not put this one down. I tried. I looked at the clock, and knew I had to go to bed, or study for college Literary courses...but, I could not stop reading..."just one more chapter," I would console myself. Needless to say, I finished the book in a couple of days and I will definitely need to order more of Neil Gaiman's books.In one of my English courses, we were discussing "static" characters, and--IMHO--the main character of "American Gods" seems to be just that (a static character)...however, this is not a bad thing. There is so much going-on around and happening TO the main character that he is as livley as any action hero, despite his disposition. I could explain this, but it would ruin the plot.Just buy the book. If you know anything about Pantheons, Mythology, "Gods" and waking-up on the wrong side of bed, you'll love this book!

This outstanding, non-stop, Enlightened rant against Ignorance, Racism and the over-all Decline of American decency and Literacy was Banned by the U.S. government. However, the book survived Bureaucracy, Theocracy and other silliness to Educate the masses.Michael Moore has put into writing what the American people are thinking....well, at-least the Americans who know how to read.Moore attacks Illiteracy, Incompetence, Racism, the Corporate buyout of America--at the Governmental level, and he also devotes a chapter to informing us how corporations are plying their wares amongst the children in schools, so we can produce little automatons called "Consumers." He shows the American people that our children's new Mantra shall be "Must buy [insert Name-Brand]...."This book explains, in-detail the Corporate take-over of America, in November 2000.Fortunately, one man has the...guts...to stand up and lay out the facts, regarding our current political situation in the good ol' U.S. This book will infuriate most readers, most-likely sending them off on an information-gathering expedition, to attempt to counter Moore's statements (which is probably his secret plan ;-)Personally, being related to a former U.S. President, who was shot for espousing Anti-Ignorance and Anti-Racist agendas, I concur with Mr. Moore.My Wife, and Michael Moore have convinced me. If the Democrats do not get this mess cleaned up, I am voting Green, from now on.I strongly suggest that anyone who thinks for themselves, or treasures BOOKS should acquire this wonderful, educational rant on Politics, and other issues quickly leading to The Decline of Western Civilization. "Stupid White Men" explains the Library Funding cuts, Executed by the "President," as well.I will strongly recommend this book to everyone...until Corporate America buys me out, too.

Regardless of the reasoning behind the cd, or the marketing involved, I love it. I've played this numerous times, when in a dance/trance music mood. I was sold on it, the first time I heard the song, then I had to figure-out who they were.I have not listened to their other albums, yet, so I do not know if they received more than their 15 minutes. All that matters, to me, is that I love the Lyrics, the beat, the vocals...and, yes, the gimmick. I would give it 5 stars, if one version of the song did not have a very annoying tone in the background--which gets on my neves after a minute or so. Otherwise, I love it.

This is a wonderful Bedside book, to keep on-hand for those nights when you just can't fall-asleep. This book has been a great Sleep Aid for me, many nights. A Prescription for lack of sleep: this predicament can usually be cured with only one or two chapters.My wife uses Crowley's more boring works to put her to sleep, but &quot;Transcendental Magic&quot; works for me. Occasionally, Waite's snippety footnotes will perk you up, but Levi's laborious ramblings will send you off to nodding, immediately thereafter.I can understand why Crowley believed he was Eliphas Levi (and numerous other famous occultists/people).... Crowley has a similar rambling--(get to the point, for The God's Sake)--style, which he may have subconsciously adopted from reading Levi.Regardless, aside from the occasional glimmerings of Occult Knowledge and little revelations, this book is mostly out-dated, boring and irrelevant (but the picture of Baphomet is quite nice). I honestly believe that the only reason this book is still being published is due to the fact that it is on several occult organization's &quot;Recommended Reading Lists.&quot;This is a nice book to have on-hand to polish-off the Occult collection and use for reference material, occasionally, but the read itself is quite boring (and I have been known to read through books of Masonic Rituals).I assume this book was impressive a century-ago, but today it is pretty-much irrelevant, boring and only somewhat useful. However, due to the fact that I did make some interesting connections about the Kabalah, etc. while reading it, and it did help me fall-asleep many times, I am giving it three stars.

First, I must thank my friend, Stacie H., for recommending this book to me, about a year ago. (See my Profile Page for Her great reviews of Sylvia Browne books). I thought, for a long time, that these books would not measure-up to the previous books I have read, concerning the Afterlife and the Physics involved with Life after Death. I have been studying this sort of thing for a very long time and I have been Psychic, since Birth. I have read Tarot Cards for ten years and I have been seeing Ghosts all my life. I learned to Astral Travel, from a book called &quot;Instant ESP,&quot; also ten years ago. Therefore, I feel I should give THIS (Sylvia) book a nod, with Respect !Even after studying piles and piles of thick &quot;egghead&quot; books and books that correlate Travel on the Other Side with Physics, I truly believe that Sylvia has expressed the basic concepts and Truth of The Afterlife, in a Concise, Easy to Read, Easy to Digest format ! One need-not sit down with a pile of occult texts and Quantum Physics books to understand Why and How it all works, when Sylvia gives a very good Synopsis of the Basic Concepts. However, listening to Deepak Chopra's tapes, such as &quot;Journey to The Boundless&quot; is a Great way to understand HOW all the things Sylvia talks about are possible (and Scientific) !I find her description of The Afterlife / Astral World to be written much the same way a person would Describe ALL of Europe, after Only Traveling to France--but, aside from this very structured description, from a singular viewpoint, it still stands to Truth. However, I honestly believe not Everyone will see things Exactly the same way, or go through the Exact same proceedure upon Crossing-over. Yet, for beginners and people of All Faiths, this is a GREAT Introduction to the Afterlife, in a more Common-Sense approach, than we are taught in church. I absolutely LOVE her explanation of the Reality of Heaven, vs. the things we are Indoctrinated to believe about Heaven !!!I found my favorite new quote, in this book, as well--when I read Sylvia's opinions about Humans NOT needing a &quot;message carrier&quot; to moderate with God for us !!! (Amen). No one needs a &quot;go-between&quot; to carry messages to God. One only needs to speak Directly to The Big Guy/Gal, on a personal level. Priests need-not apply. I am very, very happy to see someone admitting the Truth--esp., after being Indoctrinated with a certain belief system that Stresses the Necessity of having a moderator Dividing us from God and Interpreting for us. Bravo ! She should get ten stars, for being so bold as to speak the Truth.I honestly believe she was writing from the Heart, in many instances. In fact, during my own Psychic Investigations, I have always noted that when something about Ghosts / Hauntings is True, I get a certain series of Chills, Gooseflesh, etc. in my body and it feels as-if someone passes through me. As I read a Touching story in this book, that Truth Test happenend to me!So, as far as I am concerned, this book receives the Psychic Seal of Approval (but, I don't have any fancy Certificates to prove it--just 30 years of Real-Life Experience).I strongly recommend people of All Faiths to read this book. This is a Wonderful Starting Point, for a Journey into the Mysteries of Life After Death ! Well-Done!

From the first time I heard Pink on the radio, I could not get the grooves out of my mind. In fact, I did not Want to. At first, I did not realize that several of my favorite songs were by this Artist. "Don't Let Me Get Me" often played in my mind, throughout the day. Every time I heard "Get The Party Started," I cranked-up the radio. Then, one day, I watched the "Don't Let Me Get Me" video, online, and I was hooked.I soon found myself looking-forward to the times when each local radio station played Pink's music....however, it wasn't enough. I had to own this collection of great songs."Just Like A Pill" began playing, locally, while I waited for my CDs to arrive, creating greater anticipation.Now, I own the CD and I can listen to Pink whenever I please (often), I can honestly say that I was very surprised. I am accustomed to purchasing entire CDs with only 1-4 good songs on them, and a lot of "filler.""Missundaztood" has no filler material. Every song is amazing and heart-felt. It seems each tune is belted-out, or sung in breathy vocals, from the soul.I am thrilled to see a musician throwing caution to the wind and doing what She wants to do...not what some record company demands of her. Even the few silly things that could have been edited-out, such as the end of the first song,"Missundaztood," add to the over-all Freedom of the collection of tunes. The song, itself, is great--very catchy.Pink's music has catchy grooves, great intros and Lyrics that stick like glue to your mind.It is wonderful to see people using this genre of music for fun and self-expression again, without using the Seattle formula. I quit buying music, for a long time (with the exception of Prince). Pink has renewed my interest in this genre of music and inspired me to delve back into the Rock/Pop field. The opening riff of "Don't Let Me Get Me" is worth the price of the CD, alone.Pink seems to be quite the Feminist and may be surprisingly inspirational to women of that persuasion, as well.If you are tired of Formula Bands, Seattle-inspired Gloom & Doom...and Industry-generated copy-cat Pop.... try "Pink."

This movie takes the word &quot;Cartoon&quot; out of your vocabulary, when describing &quot;Anime&quot; and related films. &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a visually stunning movie, with very Realistic scenes that make you understand what all the fuss is about, with this form of animation. The techniques used in the creation of this film give respect to the Artist(s) &amp; the story gives a respectful nod to &quot;Pagan&quot; motifs. The Story and Artistic Wonder of this movie will bring many people to Anime, who have not given it a try, before. This is definately a Cross-Genre movie, with something for everyone. I will never forget the beautiful, fantastic scenes and Graceful Flowing of the Imagery!!! I was not interested in Anime, until my fiance' and I watched this Adventure, together....then, I was hooked. However, once you have seen this movie, most animation seems of a &quot;lesser&quot; standard and doesn't give you the same Impact! It's like gaining Knowledge, once you acquire it, you cannot go-back.... So, hope that the Anime Artists continue their work &amp; support their endeavors! I recommend this one for Adults, not just Children!

Bloody Mallory is a wild ride, with a Tranny in the back seat. She fights evil with the help of a Transvestite and locks horns with the most evil force on earth: The Church....no, wait, she is trying to Save The Pope.Ah well, she fights the lesser evil: the demons, and struggles to rescue the greater evil: the pope. Bloody Mallory is a campy, yet serious (sort of) film that may leave you scratching your head at times. Action sequences, weird car rides, and ghostly encounters abound.If, for some strange reason, you do not enjoy the film as much as I did you can frame the cover photo. Other reviewers covered the basics, so I am just throwing in my two cents. This movie is weird, but unique and probably a cult classic.

How can one review the words of a Genius, many years ahead of his time....a man who's mind grasped concepts that most people still do not remotely comprehend...a man who worked as a Humanitarian, while the world thought him a destroyer...? This book contains Einstien's views on Politics, Disarmament, Education, Freedom, The Jewish People, Germany, and much more. I found this work to be very inspiring and hope to see it never go out of print....for the Great Minds of the past are our Hope for The Future.

My fiance' convinced me to watch this movie &amp; I thought it was a low-budget, acid-trip kind of B-movie, at-first.... But, as the story develops it actually gets quite interesting (don't let the &quot;G&quot; rating fool ya--I didn't know kids could watch this sort of...&quot;stuff&quot;).I had to review this movie, because I cannot get the song outta my head ( &quot;What's the buzz? Tell me what's a happening.... ).However, my personal favorite, was the song in-which the Apostles sing, &quot;Then we'll All write a Gospel, so they'll talk about us, when we die....&quot; &lt;g&gt; It was worth watching the movie, for that bit, alone !If you are a Christian, this movie will probably just make you mad--but, not as angry as &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; probably made you. This movies seems to retain a reverence for Jesus Christ and his message. So, if you can accept the fact that Jesus might have had a sense of humor, you will enjoy this film.This movie is the strangest version of the Jesus story I have encountered!

Jason Statham is a Bad A**. This guy is amazing. If his Fast Paced, Extraordinary abilities, and the intense Action of this film are not enough for you, wait until you see the "Bad Girl" of the film!The super hot, Bad Girl is enough to make me switch sides, but The Transporter sticks to his guns. writing this makes me want to watch the film, again, so I can gander at the Bad Girl. She makes Evil look Sexy.IfThe Transporter (Special Delivery Edition)andTransporter 2get you juiced up, and you want more.... TryCrank (Widescreen Edition)!!!Crank (Widescreen Edition)is likeThe Transporter Collectionon...steroids. Crank is extremely fast paced, and may leave you breathless.Jason Statham flicks are my cup of tea.

This book will send Anti-Masons and Evangelists scurrying through dusty book piles, looking for more irrelevant material to feed the frenzy of fanaticism! The Taxil hoax, which seems to be one of the most-quoted anti-masonic pieces of &quot;literature&quot; is explained. Many other aspects of criticism against the fraternity are also explained. The authors do a terrific job of debunking (easily) the myth of Templar/Freemason &quot;Unholy Worship.&quot; This is a great book for Freemasons to have, if they are confronted with confused views (or Sincere Concern, from church members) or would just like a quick synopsis of the general attitudes about their fraternity to have on-hand. This book will enlighten Non-Masons and Anti-Masons and dispell some of the Myths. This is a thin book, with references to other sources of information, therefor it is a quick read--yet, you will refer to if often. Many Masons do not believe in answering accusations against their Honorable order...they do not need to. They simply need this book--it will do the job for them. Also, this book should be followed by &quot;A Pilgrim's Path,&quot; by John J. Robinson, who explains--thoroughly and more in-depth--the views for and against Freemasonry. I am truly happy that Dafoe has put-together such a wonderful, informative book. Buy one for your church, so the congregation will rest at-ease knowing their Masonic Brethren are not doing anything negative. (The cover on my copy--recent purchase from Amazon.com--only has pics of Albert Pike and Leo Taxil, which would not look inappropriate carrying into church, to hand to the Minister/Preacher/Priest/Rabbi, etc.)

This book is a must-have for those interested in The Templars. In a sea of Nonsense and ancient falsehoods, regarding the order of Knights Templar, this book is a shining gem of common-sense. The authors strive to use Logic, instead of silly fake documents and other ludicrous garbage to speculate about the known and suspected history of the Templars. Instead of quoting long sections of other recent books, the authors simply refer you to the other works, assuming you have probably already read them, anyway (and...they are most-likely correct). If you have read the other works about the Templars--esp., Robinson's &quot;Born in Blood,&quot; you will find this book a concise, easy read with some new thoughts on the subject of the Templar's history. If not, this book gives you ample research suggestions.... So, either way, you can't lose. Another benefit of this book is that it is thin-enough (because the authors get directly to the point, instead-of heavy quoting and such) to place it in your jacket or pants pocket. This would be a great book to loan to your friends, if you practice my own method of using clear contact paper (slowly and carefully) over the cover of the book, to prevent it's destruction in transit. Look for their other books, as-well! I loved &quot;Unholy Worship? The Myth of the Baphomet, Templar, Freemason Connection,&quot; by Stephen Dafoe. If you enjoy thinking for yourself, you will enjoy their books....if you do not like thinking for yourself read Kah!

There are so many reasons why &quot;The Templar Continuum&quot; surpasses the genre in new information. Much of what we see in print is mere speculation or wishful-thinking, yet these authors have dedicated an enormous amount of time to research, travel, communication with other authors of the genre, taking pictures of sites they write about--and seem to be as enthusiastic about history as most men are about sports. I have greatly admired John J. Robinson for many years....but, I must admit, &quot;The Templar Continuum&quot; gave me an entirely New Perspective about St. Bernard of Clairvaux! My mental image of this monumental man has completely altered....and, it all feels so true. Previously, I only saw him as a weak, sickly man (possibly a puppet figure)--now, however.... (read the book--I'm not giving it away!). Also, as someone fascinated by Archaeology, I was &quot;immersed&quot; in the detailed description of Cistercian Monastaries-- if only modern men would be so Clean and Organized! There seem to be so many connections between the Cistercians and the Essenes that many of the proposed theories of this book appear to be inescapable. With a respectful nod to other works about The Templars, Butler and Dafoe offer this valuable contribution to the Information Age....with the credentials to back-up their views. If &quot;The Warriors And The Bankers&quot; made you crave more, the authors have Delivered! This one is Thick with new information to add to your mentalcatalogue of Templar history, and will placate your need for a longer read...yet, when you finish, don't despair...a sequel is on the way! If you are beginning to believe that most Templar books are written from a template, this one will renew your excitement.

Dafoe has done it, again! This compilation of Fraternal poetry will be a great asset to any Masonic library. Wonderful coffee-table book and reference material. My sister gave me this book for Christmas and I finished reading it in one sitting! I was especially happy with &quot;The Mother-Lodge,&quot; by Bro. Rudyard Kipling. I have always had a deep love for Poetry and I found this book to be very Inspirational! I sincerely hope Dafoe has more great books to offer us, in the future. Wonderful Collection of Verse.... Any chance of a Volume II hitting the shelves, soon? I always recommend this book to New Brothers or other individuals requesting a list of books about Masonry, because they have decided to Petition The Lodge.

I purchased a paperback copy of this book in 1990, and I have owned it &amp; Loaned it, ever-since. I just wrote a review for a Sylvia Browne book, mentioning how Valuable David St. Clair's book truly is ! However....now, I see it is &quot;out of print.&quot; How very Sad.I learned to Astral Travel, by reading this book, before joining an organization with very expensive books and tests and fancy certificates..... The only thing about the teachings of the org. that was more explanatory of &quot;Astral Travel,&quot; was the fact that it alos taught the Mechanics of it all (Physics). However, you can get that information, easily, from Deepak Chopra's &quot;Journey to The Boundless&quot; and his other works. So, SAVE Yourself some Money and buy David St. Clair's Lessons in Easy ESP and some of Deepak's Tape-sets.You will save Tons of money and have Wonderful Results. Organizations will try to inform you that you must do all this in a very complicated manner, with a lot of superfluous rigamarole....but, let's face Reality : You do this, Every Night, when you go to sleep! &amp; Org.s want your hard-earned Cash.If you own this book, you will value it, treasure it &amp; loan it to all your friends in the field of interest.

I finally read &quot;The Davinci Code&quot; after many years of studying the resource materials, and I loved the book so much that I read &quot;Angels & Demons,&quot; immediately thereafter.I literally could not put &quot;Angels & Demons&quot; down and read it in two days. For me, the story was very compelling and I was caught-up in the intrigue, Illuminati references and the idea of The Vatican being blown to smithereens.At-first, it was very, very difficult for me to comprehend *why* someone would try save the Vatican from extinction--but, the author proved the case (priceless paintings, artwork and History)...so, I was able to get-over the shock of the motivation factor and delve into the story completely. As the hero raced-around Rome, trying to save the day, I could not decide which side to root-for. The author tricked me into sometimes favoring the Vatican (no easy task).I was fascinated and captivated by this story and highly recommend the book to anyone who studies The Mysteries or just loves a good, past-paced tale of intrigue.

I could not wait for this to come out, so I saw it on the Big Screen. Soon, I was purchasing the film. This film and series is definitely in my top favorites list! I watch anything with Johnny Depp, but this movie has an astounding cast; Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley !!!, as well. You can't go wrong with this one.Geoffrey Rush is truly fantastic, and steals scenes. Many of the background characters steal scenes, also. It seems that each actor truly Enjoyed creating this film. The series is fantastic.Purchase them all, because you'll regret it if you do not. Fill up your cart;Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), andPirates of the Caribbean - At World's End (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).

I Love Zone Alarm, for home systems. When I install an O.S., I immediately insatll Norton's Anti-virus &amp; Zone Alarm, before connecting the computer to the internet. Then, as each application asks permission to use the connection to the internet, I either Accept or Decline the request. For a couple of days, this can be a bit annoying, and frustrates people who want to quickly show you something on the internet--but, overall this is a good thing. If you take a few days to Install, Update and configure Zone Alarm, on a home system, you Rarely find any Spyware or Adware in the system (unless you click the wrong buttons or download things you chould't from the internet). I have been *very* pleased with Zone Alarm--even if it frustrates my friends.Personally, I would rather take a little extra time to Accept or Deny a program's access to the internet, than wasting all the time it takes to clean-up a system that is infested with Spyware, Adware, etc.Sometimes, I must spend over an hour removing Spyware, Adware and restarting virus protection, remotely, on corporate systems (that are running McAffee and a dummed-down firewall).One thing people need to realize is that A.V. protection is just ONE of the major requirements for running a Windows system. Currently, if you are not running A.V. protection, a Firewall (!!!), Microsoft Updates and &quot;Spybot Search &amp; Destroy&quot; (or a similar Spyware / Adware removal tool that is well-tested), your system is destined for Doom.A good combination, for great protection, is : &quot;Norton Antivirus 2004 Professional,&quot; by Symantec &amp; &quot;Zone Alarm.&quot; However, if you do not do the Microsoft Updates, your system will be toast, regardless, and you can plan on a lot of O.S. re-installations.I also recommend using a Router with a built-in firewall, in combination with Zone Alarm, but the average person needs at-least Zone Alarm.&quot;An ounce of Protection is worth a pound of Cure.&quot;

I found this book to be absolutely fascinating! I have always desired to travel to Egypt and this guide has it All! John A. West is, like all men of genius, Controversial and ahead of his time. His guide is a first-hand experience of Egypt, compiled with resource knowledge and personal perspective. He explains where to get what and what not to take where and where to go when you are there! John A. West makes a historical text of this guidebook and it can fit in most pockets, although it is quite thick with information. I have not had the opportunity, yet, to visit Egypt...however, the great man who introduced me to this treasure had just come to America from Egypt on a tour around the globe. According to him, this book was a terrific source of information during his travels through the Ancient capitol of the world. I thank him, for recommending this guide to me--it has been quite useful in my studies of Anthropology. I cannot wait to test this book, for myself! History students will enjoy this one, as well.

I found this movie to be very informative, and US citizens should watch this because most are unaware of how media works. I've studied Journalism, so I was very interested in this film.Recently, while listening to NPR, I discovered that one of the main individuals featured in this documentary, Josh Rushing, has now joined the English Al Jazeera network.If you want to understand the news media, Propaganda, and the US situation in Iraq this documentary is a good resource. Very interesting.

I cannot believe there is only One review for this Marvelous book! I assumed this book would have a hundred reviews--so I never looked it up, until today. Everyone is missing-out !I discovered this book in '94, and I concurred with much of the material Sutphen penned in this Revelation of Self-Fulfillment. I agreed, whole-heartedly, with his views of Relationships and the FACT that it is virtually Impossible for two people to live in a Monogamous situation, without ever &quot;experimenting&quot; on the side. It doesn't happen. Humans are Psychologically, Culturally, Religiously and Socially CONDITIONED and INDOCTRINATED to Believe that humans are supposed to be Monogamous....however, Statistics, Health Research and Common Sense reveal that Monogamy is a Myth.Being a Writer, people Always Confide in me. Also, I study Anthropology and Psychology in the hopes of becoming an Anthropologist. I honestly believe that only 1% of the population is Truly Monogamous. Everyone-else is lying.This book Destroys the Myths and Social Silliness of unacceptance of &quot;Alternative&quot; Relationships. Who says we cannot love 2 or 3 people, at-once ? You love your Spouse, Children, Close Family and Close Friends......why-not 2 or 3 &quot;Lovers?&quot; Sutphen explains the Myths that subjugate our minds into submission to Antiquated thinking about Relationships, and gives us a WONDEFUL concept to live-by......&quot;You shouldn't let people 'should' on you.&quot;To me, this was a Revelation ! I read his book 7 years ago and I accepted &quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot; in Concept and in Practice. However, I must admit, I was already open-minded about &quot;Open Relationships,&quot; before reading the book &amp; I had already been practicing this &quot;Radical&quot; theory for many years.When you read Sutphen's reasoning about the concept of &quot;You shouldn't let people 'should' on you,&quot; it will become a Revelation to you, as well !While reading this well-written, Exciting treatise on &quot;Radical Spirituallity,&quot; you will re-evaluate your Actions, Reactions and Views about Family life, Friends and everyone-else you communicate with.How many times, per day (esp., from your parents--no-matter how old you are, or how-long you have been on your own), do you hear &quot;You Should....do this&quot; &amp; &quot;You Should....do that&quot; or &quot;You Shouldn't....do this / or that&quot; ?! Think about it. Why do you do most of the things you do? Conditioning &amp; Indoctrinization.Buy this book and destroy the conditioning in your mind, so that you can be Free to Think and Act as you please. This book will Free your Mind..... and you are Not obligated to Invite so-and-so to such-n-such Event, because someone says you &quot;Should!&quot;&quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot; will Reveal to you the Path of Happiness. Personally, the people who have always told ME, &quot;You Should&quot; are NOT Happy people...just people who exist and do what they &quot;should.&quot;Acquire this book and get the word out ! &quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot; is an Awakening.

For The Mystic, this collection of Poetic Insights is very difficult to put-down. Once you start reading, it is almost impossible to do anything but ingest the complex blocks of text before your eyes. Be sure you have some reading time set-aside, before you tackle this one. I read it in two sittings, but I would-have finished it in one, if I only had the time!Only Mystics will fully appreciate this Work of amazing verbal, Qabalistic Conundrums.Any student of Crowley should have this text on-hand, because he refers the reader to this Poetic treatise, more often than not. Regardless of whether you are reading his &quot;Confessions&quot; (Autohagiography) or his Qabalistic masterpiece, &quot;777,&quot; you will casually be referred back to the good ol' &quot;Book of Lies.&quot;I never imagined this book of Crowley's whimsical jottings would prove so intriguing or helpful in pursuit of mystical knowledge. Crowley often refers to this book as his most-important work. However, don't expect to &quot;get it&quot; right-away. This is more of a Text-book, than a casual Poetry book.I am surprised he didn't put a Test in the back!However, this book is all-about testing yourself, not being tested by others. Luckily, the Commentaries were added for us common folk. Enjoy !

I received this game for my Birthday and I have been playing it almost every day, for months ! I have never been a "Gamer," but this game turned me on to the pleasures of Strategic Stress Relief.This game is Chess x 20 !You cannot simply build an army of Footmen, Archers & Knights, then run-over the enemy, with Brute Force. You must learn to develop Strategies using Ballistas, Wizards, Palladins, etc. with Upgraded weapons, armor & men. Also, you must learn to build Destroyers and Battleships to protect your coast-line.This is a fascinating game, with complicated scenarios that refresh your brain cells, while you relieve stress. Rough day at work? Wack some Orcs !Teenagers will find this game challenging and cannot use simple Hack n Slash techniques to win the scenarios.This game has influenced me to also add "Age of Empires," "Rune Gold," & "Stronghold" to my CD-Rom collection.If you can schedule some free time with a friend, Battle.net is a great way to test your skill with the game, as well. You can play on-line against each-other, or together against others/ the computer.I highly recommend War Craft II, because I never purchased a PC video game (since I was a teenager), until I acquired this game.I would write more, but I can't wait to play another scenario....

I have always believed in equality and feel ashamed of the way other men have treated women. At times, I have wished that I could completely disassociate myself from Patriarchal society and men, in-general. In fact, if not for The Masons I would probably just give up on men, as a general rule. However, I suppose it is better to offer them books like this one, which is enlightening and gives a wonderful representation of The Feminine and Goddess influences on humankind. This book gives men a view of Woman undistorted by patriarchal, propagandist, or nonsensical traditional notions passed down through the generations that place women in a lower realm of Society and Culture, than men. You would have to live in a cave to be unaware of The Goddess imagery pre-dating God imagery...however, cave-dwellers will be awakened by this well-written book. I read it in '93 and it made a tremendous impact on my thinking, although I was already very appreciative of Women and their nature. This book will defeat some Silly Superstitions about a woman's Moon Time, as well. Read this book and stop treating a woman's Period as something threatening, disgusting or worse. I cannot say enough good things about &quot;Mysteries of The Dark Moon,&quot; it is an Anthropologist's delight!

The beginning of this film is very cinematic, and the camera techniques pulled me in. At first, the scenes flowed like a music video without a music video soundtrack; these scenes pull the viewer into the story. I was highly impressed with the cinematography from the first few seconds. The film quality, style, costumes, and all other aspects of this DVD are fantastic. The acting is wonderful, smooth, realistic, and I became caught-up in the characters mentally rooting for them and becoming engaged in the story.This film is full of amazing twists and turns, surprises and real life drama without melodramatic overacting. It is very difficult to express how wonderfully the characters come to life, without giving away aspects of endearing moments in the film.However, I will add this.... This film contains many elements of intrigue and human interaction; love, betrayal, erotic scenes of steamy sensuality, and many surprising journeys one would not expect in such a tale.I highly recommend this film. I would give "Tipping the Velvet" seven stars if possible, and it is now my second favorite movie ("Dangerous Liaisons" being the first fave). This product is well-worth the price! This is one you will want to watch many times, and introduce to others.I cannot tell a lie, I originally bought "Tipping the Velvet" because I love bi-sexual women and "lesbian" scenarios, and I am an English Communications major (therefore, I study British Literature and European history). I purchased the film because of the information on (.......).The quality of this film, cinematography and the story is amazing.

This Set gets one more * than the Rider Deck, because this one comes with a book. A. E. Waite is well-respected in the study of The Mysteries!This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner. The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these &quot;simple&quot;-looking cards). The images are perfectly acceptable for teaching Children the use of/or stories of The Tarot. In fact, they almost seem to be created with a child-like Happy view of the world, set in fairy-tale history. The Advanced Tarot Reader will not be so impressed with this deck, yet each person must begin somewhere on the Royal Path. Personally, I believe this is a great first stepping-stone on the path of enlightenment. Even thoroughly Indoctrinated Christians will not find too much to worry about in these beautiful cards. This is a great way to start your Mystical Journey!

This Investigation into the cloudy history of Freemasonry and the Origins of The Shroud of Turin is so well-conceived, written, explained and researched that I am amazed the general public has access to the material. Normally, I tend to write flippant, funny reviews.... However, "The Second Messiah" is such a truly illuminating book that I feel compelled to tone it down, considerably. Reverence? Perhaps. I have been dropping hints here and there, in other reviews, but would not specifically back certain theories ---e.g., the concept of the Shroud being painted by Leonardo da Vinci ("The Templar Revelation," by Picknett &amp; Prince)....great read, but not plausible. My grandfather owned two volumes called: "The Complete Works of Leonardo da Vinci" (fully Illustrated, with notes made by Leonardo). Somehow, after growing up with those books, I don't think the Leonardo theory jives. This work, by Knight and Lomas, however, is based on terrific research and is based on a real-world hypothesis. It seems, to me, after studying everything I can get my hands on about Masonry, that Knight and Lomas know more than they let-on....or, have been extremely "lucky" with their insights, informants and book discoveries, but that makes it even more interesting to me. I keep wondering what the Next book will reveal ! This one Reveals quite a lot.....in fact, I doubt it could-have been published ten years ago. I feel that the Masons must be ready to join the Information Age, or Knight and Lomas would not have gotten this book printed. They have done a wonderful job and everything makes sense. There are no Loopy Theories or silly proposals, based on illusive myths. I believe they are onto something and that something is quite possibly The Truth.

This Holy Book of The New Aeon -- &quot;received&quot; by Aleister Crowley, circa 1904 (ev: &quot;era vulgara&quot;--commonly known as &quot;ce&quot;), was created by Aleister Crowley under circumstances which may have been &quot;automatic writing,&quot; &quot;channeling&quot; or direct communication from an entity named &quot;Aiwas&quot; (presumably Crowley's &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot; or a &quot;Praeterhuman&quot; entity).There are many inconsistencies in the various telling and retelling of the story of the formation of this &quot;Holy Book,&quot; yet this is the case with ALL &quot;Holy Books&quot; --so, each person is encouraged to investigate (think) for themselves and delve into the Mysteries of The Book of The Law, of their own Free Will and Accord.The following books will clear things up a bit and allow an individual to research &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot; I highly recommend these books:&quot;The Law Is for All : The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis Sub Figura Ccxx, the Book of the Law,&quot; by Aleister Crowley, et al--which explains &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; (ISBN: 1561840904). See my review and other reviews for more information.&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; by Aleister Crowley--a collection of &quot;Inspired&quot; writings about the Religion of Thelema. (ISBN: 0877286868). See my review and other reviews for more information.&quot;The Equinox of the Gods&quot; by Aleister Crowley--the Creation and Evolution of the religion of Thelema. (ISBN: 1561840289). This book has also been republished in &quot;Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4&quot; (ISBN: 0877289190)--See my review and other reviews for more information.Also, this one is handy for Thelemic Qabbalists:&quot;The Complete Concordance to Aleister Crowley's The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis)&quot; by Wolfgang Gregory Zeuner (ISBN: 1890109509). See my review and other reviews for more information.Note: &quot;Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4&quot; (ISBN: 0877289190) and &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; (ISBN: 0877286868) would be a great starting point to comprehending &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; &amp; &quot;Thelema&quot; --yet, I strongly suggest &quot;The Law is for All&quot;(ISBN: 1561840904), as well.&quot;The Law is for All&quot; is a great book to recommend to those who are scratching their heads about &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;

I passed upHouse of 1,000 Corpses, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome. I never rented it. However, I watchedThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and loved the movie. A coworker explained that this was a "part two" ofHouse of 1,000 Corpses, so I gave it a chance.I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves. I also purchased the following items related to this flick;House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics),House of 1,000 Corpses, and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own. I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.

The Xanth series is a collection of Tongue-in-Cheek adventurous wanderings through a world where word-play is reality and reality is like a Dream World, from-which you cannot awake--yet, the stories are fantasy episodes comparable to the other great works of the genre, by your favorite Fantasy Writers...only, with a comedic twist and a perfectly placed punch-line (which, in his world, would probably be a running of the gauntlet, with burly men throwing wild swings at your head) now and then! Piers Anthony is a master of word usage and placement--just look at his other titles, even the book names he comes up with make you curious to see what's inside the artistic covers of his stories. &quot;A Spell for Chameleon&quot; is the place to embark upon the tour through Anthony's strange and exciting universe-- but, when the tour of Xanth is over, go visit the world of &quot;The Blue Adept.&quot; Piers Anthony is a wonderful writer and one of the men who helped me survive High School. After reading some intense Terry Brooks, I'd kick-back with some Xanth novels and relax a little. I very-much recommend the &quot;THE APPRENTICE ADEPT&quot; series, which is unlike anything you have probably read, before.... You will thoroughly enjoy Stile's adventures and his attempts to live in Two Worlds, simultaneously.

This handy Concordance to &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; -- a Thelemic &quot;Holy Book&quot; -- which was written by Aleister Crowley (possibly through &quot;automatic writing&quot; or, perhaps, by channeling an entity named &quot;Aiwas&quot;--which may, or may not be Crowley's &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot;) is, basically, a thin book which lists numerous Words and where they fall in &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;This concordance to &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; has a few pages of introduction, then a &quot;concordance&quot; for all those individuals who ignore &quot;The Comment&quot; and delve into the Qabbalistic aspects of TBoTL.&quot;The Comment&quot; published with &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; was an injunction to not study &quot;The Book of The Law&quot;--which is over-all a method of preventing the possibility of a system of religious figures (Preachers, Priests, Ministers, etc.) from espousing a particular denomination / slant of &quot;Thelema&quot; and trying to monopolize the system (as we see in nearly all major religions in the world).However, for all practical purposes &quot;The Comment&quot; has been given a polite nod of respect and those with common sense do not actually burn their copy of &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; after one reading.Most &quot;Thelemites&quot; are Qabbalists and study the Numerology of words, phrases, etc. --therefore, the author of this &quot;Concordance&quot; has provided a breakdown of the words used in TBoTL and gives Thelemites a head-start on analyzing the intricacies of the Qabbalistic aspects of the &quot;Holy Book.&quot;The definition of &quot;Concordance&quot; : &quot;an index of the words in a text or texts, showing every context in which they occur.&quot;This is a useful book for Thelemic Qabbalists.

Finding Neverland (not Michael's place) is an interesting journey. As always, Johnny Depp is perfect. However this movie is not all fun and games, and refusal to grow up. A sadness lurks in the shadows, and leaves me wanting to watchHook, again to liven things up.Great movie, but contains drama as well as humor. You may teer up a bit, though the laughs prevail.

Only Hollywood magic could transform Charlize Theron into this character, as she portrays a real serial killer.Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci fall in love, and I am so happy. Then the proverbial s41t hits the fan, and the unhappy hooker (Theron) goes psycho.You thought some of your ex-s and lovers were tough? The unhappy hooker, a delusional loser, finds a second chance, gains romance, then goes off the deep end. Christina Ricci is young, naive, and runs away to live happily ever after with her girlfriend. Stop the movie, and all is well. Continue the movie, and experience the result of way too much pent up aggression literally exploding. The hooker struggles desperately to retain her new life, love, and she tries to go straight.Without education, the hooker thinks she can waltz into an office and simply attain a real job. She has no education, credentials, or manners, so the real world is much tougher than she expected. Trying to make a nice home for her young lover, she strives to provide. Sounds like a nice drama or romance to cuddle up to, eh?Suffice to say that the hooker kills the mood. Poor little (maybe not so naive) Christina Ricci becomes tough, and things progressively get weirder.If you don't dig the psycho drama, tension, or criminal theme, you may enjoy the lesbian romance as it unfolds in unusual ways.

Crowley sets his whimsical, humorous (notorious?) writing style aside, to take a deep, reverent look at The Tarot. This book contains more information about The Tarot and the Creation of The Tarot than numerous other books combined. This is not a "fluffy" book for amateurs, but a well-written and researched work connecting The Tarot with The Qabalah and Astrology.If the tiny booklet in the Tarot package left you wanting, this is the book you desire to fulfill your hunger and thirst for more knowledge. I have been reading books about The Tarot for ten years and "The Book of Thoth" has quenched my thirst.However, I also recommend purchasing "The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Symbols," by Angeles Arrien ("Tarot Symbols from a Psychological, Mythological, and Cross-Cultural Perspective")."The Tarot Handbook...." by Arrien, uses Illustrations of "The Thoth Deck," by Crowley and Lady Frieda Haris to explain the Jungian Psychology of the system, and gives a Helpful Overview of Interpreting the Thoth deck.So-far, "The Thoth Deck" is the BEST deck I have ever found (I collect Numerous decks) aside from "The Ceremonial Magick Deck" (by Lon Duquette) & "The Masonic Tarot" (which is hard to find). Nearly every Serious Tarot User/Student I know uses The Thoth Deck, with wonderful & Accurate Results.I do suggest, however, finding the Palm-sized Thoth deck, as opposed to the Oversized Deck--which is harder to manipulate. The cards work on a principle of Psychokenisis combined with Jungian Psychology. But, whatever works for you, personally."The Book of Thoth" is a great asset to any Tarot Library and a good place to start studying the System. However, many people need to begin with a simple deck, such as Rider-Waite, before delving into the in-depth study of Crowley's works.

Prof Mickey Hess (author) recommended Joe Meno during a Creative writing course; I read this book and could not put it down. If you have ever listened to a Guns-n-Roses album (CD), listened to "Heavy Metal," Punk, '80s, Goth music, or known a "Goth"...or generally felt at odds with the world or authority figures, this is a must-read. The style is unusual, but believable and true to the mind-frame of the narrator. This book is a unique experience that I recommend checking out.If you dig music, alternative culture, Individualism, or you've experienced the traumatic, insane world of high school this book will click with your personal experiences. Cliques are represented in tribal ways that reveal how little society has changed, with the exception of adornments.I enjoyed this book so much that I've added Meno's other works to my Wish List. This author's clique of friends and authors are interesting people, worth looking into. This book is full of creative energy and reveals the struggle to deal with teenage angst, while evolving toward adulthood. The main character seems trapped in a teenage realm of emotions, desires, and quirks that allow us to feel in tune with his journey and issues.I believe that this book will appeal to numerous people from many genres and subcultures, even "normal" groups of individuals that simply survived high school....or are currently striving to survive high school, or even college.Though the main character is male, his female friend receives plenty of page space, therefore readers of either gender can easily appreciate this book. "Hairstyles of the Damned" is not just for Dudes!

I had to purchase this. I did not bother renting it, first. After an interview with the director (on NPR), I was hooked, already. I study Spanish and History (and many other subjects), so the premise of the film sparked my interest on collegiate levels as well as peaking my Fantasy interests.The author discussed his childhood, Mexico, studies of Spanish history during the Fascist era, then he explained how he infused all of this into the film. When I purchased the movie, I was not disappointed!Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)lives up to the previews, interviews, and expectations created before its release.This film is a Dark fantasy, and I doubt that some children could handle the content but this is a wonderful tale. The movie is very intense, and deals with Real World issues; death, female subservience, war, poverty, fascism, and a host of negative human emotions and actions. Simultaneously, the Fantasy aspects of this great film give us a window into Other Worlds, and give the little girl an escape from harsh reality.Though I would not recommend this movie for most children (below the age of 11-13, depending upon their maturity), I certainly recommend this film for everyone else (especially adults). Few people remember or care about history, therfore history is repeating itself. This film could be set in the near future, just as easily as it seems to be set in the past. This film will be eternal: a classic.

The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. His books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. This guide to Middle Earth is a wonderful gift for any Tolkien fan and serves as a terrific guide to the reader...especially those who have not read the books as many times as most of us have. Even if you get Lost in Tolkien's words...you will not get lost in his world!

Well, this is certainly an appropriate movie to purchase for Xmas, with all the Crazy blood-shed in the Holy Land.... Wow, perfect timing. Makes you wonder if Jay and Silent Bob truly are Prophets.... This time, they brought in Chris Rock (the Thirteenth Apostle!) --that, alone, should make you want to snag this one up and journey with our heroes on a quest to save humanity from annihilation. This film combines the usual comical exchanges between Jay and Silent Bob, with a very theological and compelling soul journey....spiced with heroic gestures of humanitarianism (or attempts to get laid?). The scenes of Angels interacting with mere mortals were absolutely priceless! I love the airport scene, with the Nun.... This is an irreverent movie, with Monty Pythonesque overtones, that you will watch again and again. You'd rent it so many times that you could have purchased a copy for an Xmas gift, for a friend...unless, you are a Grinch and buy another Jay-Bob flick, like &quot;Mall Rats.&quot; They've come a long way, since &quot;Clerks&quot; &amp; the budget for this movie must-have been fantastic. I did not expect the film to be so high-quality. Even the special effects were Tremendous. These guys are moving up in the world.... I wonder what Bob would say, if he won an Oscar, one day?

Manly P. Hall (33rd degree Mason &amp; founder of The Philosophical Research Society) gives us an illuminating, poetically written treatise on the origins of Ancient Masonry and the underlying, meaning of much Masonic Symbolism and practice. Hall's book is a poetic read, that can be consumed in one sitting, yet will be read and refered to many times again. He details some of the spiritual aspects of the hidden meanings of Masonry and the ancient origins from-which the modern fraternity receives it's wisdom. The Foreward is by Reynold E. Blight, 33rd degree, K.T. &amp; the illustrations are by J. Augustus Knapp, 32nd degree.... Obviously, this man is viewed as a Great, within the ranks of the Fraternity. You will treasure this book and feel uplifted, each time you open the cover and read a random sentence or paragraph. You will learn the true reasons why a man should petition for admission into the Honorable Masonic Lodge....not for personal advancement--but, for advancement of the human race.

Finally, a book that explains The Qabalah in a user-friendly, comprehensible format! I highly recommend The Chicken Qabalah to anyone interested in the subjects of; Qabalah, Magick, Masonry, Astrology, Tarot, etc. This wonderful Treatise on the subject explains The Qabalah in a fun, entertaining manner that sort-of tricks you into learning the subject.Most books about The Qabalah (Cabalah, Kabalah...spell it however you want, and don't worry about it) will put you to sleep-thus are not conducive to teaching the subject. However, The Good Rabbi has figured-out a way to trick us into staying-awake long-enough not-only to get through a chapter, but THE ENTIRE BOOK !My wife and I both finished this book very quickly-in fact, we could not put it down. After reading the book, my wife made some wonderful Qabalah Flash Cards, based-upon The Good Rabbi's work, "777" (Crowley --ISBN: 0877286701) and "Paths of Wisdom," by John Michael Greer (ASIN: 1567183158 ). We have found this is the easiest way to learn Qabalistic Correspondences, The Hebrew Alphabet, etc. My wife's idea was brilliant and we now have requests for the Flash Cards, from other would-be Chicken Qabalists."The Chicken Qabalah" is, without question, the most fascinating book I have ever read, on the subject! Anyone who can make The Qabalah interesting as The Good Rabbi has should get a Gold Medal, or...perhaps, a Gold Chicken award.I will treasure my copy of "The Chicken Qabalah" and give it a clear-contact-paper cover to protect it on it's journey about the house-it doesn't take a Psychic to see that this book will be a constant resource / reference in my studies and will rarely find it's way back to the bookshelf.For anyone who has ever been interested in The Qabalah, but doesn't want to grow old and grey trying to figure it out-or, for anyone who has tried and fell-asleep or become frustrated-this is the best book to acquire, for an introductory course and an exciting, humorous read! Besides, The Rabbi has figured it all out for us, and explained it with diagrams / illustrations, so don't worry about it.You'll laugh, you'll cry....you'll mutter to yourself, "well, I'll be damned !" Often, you may find yourself slapping your forehead, and proclaiming, "Duh." (Illumination is like that, sometimes). Also, you will find yourself learning the Hebrew letters despite yourself....I do not want to give it away (so to speak), but the methods The Rabbi uses to teach the Hebrew Letters are unforgettable.If I were to give this book a short description, it would be "Common Sense Qabalah."Disclaimer:For anyone, who feels the need to inform me that only one version of The Qabalah is correct...or believes only one organization is correct...or that "Western Qabalah isn't `real' Kabbalah"...or doesn't approve of the Rabbi's style...I only have one thing to say,"I'm a Chicken Qabalist, and I don't worry about it."

The Masonic Tarot Surpasses all the decks I own, with the exception of The A.C. Thoth Deck. I have used The Masonic Tarot, daily & I thank my fianc&eacute; for buying them for me, before they went out of print. These cards are still available, but they are hard to acquire. They are worth all of the effort and every penny spent! You will Treasure these cards, forever. I have been using The Tarot for ten years and I consider The Masonic Tarot to be the Pinnacle of my collection.If you would like a preview, send me an email.

The Last Temptation of Christ was so controversial that I could not find it for quite a while, here in the Heartland. Luckily, we have The Internet, now.... So, personal prejudices are not so controlling, anymore. You'd think, as many &quot;Adult&quot; movies as the stores carried, they would have a movie like Temptation, which is more....Intellectually Stimulating. I haven't seen this one for a very long time, but I recall enough to know that it is probably more topical NOW, than it was when it was released. With all the books published, recently, about the Gnostic Gospels, the Nag Hammadi texts, Mary Magdalene, Freemasonry and other previously hidden material...now is the Tyme. If you are a free-thinker, who seriously wants to understand religion, instead-of letting others do your thinking for you...or, you are simply curious about a movie that caused such a fuss...toss this one in your shopping cart and delve into the mystery.

********** &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot; is, without question, the most wonderful book I have ever owned! I spent hours slowly turning the pages and looking at the Very Well- Produced Artwork!!! You will be amazed, when you first open the book. The printing is also very stylish and sets-off the Mystical nature of the very large &lt;this is a &quot;reduced&quot; size?!&gt; compendium of knowledge. I have been studying Masonic &amp; Hermetic Philosophy, Psychology, Anthropology, Astrology, etc. for the last ten years....and this book just left my jaw hanging, in wonder and rapture. You will see what appears to be originals of many &quot;occult&quot; images that permeate the mass-market. This is high-quality art that begs to be placed on even the wealthiest person's coffee-table. Even if you only purchase this book for it's superb artwork and Masonic / Hermetic / Kabalistic illustrations, pictures/paintings &amp; Alchemical drawings, you will not be disappointed!!! I recommend this book to people who do not like to read and to those who Love to Read! Either way, you cannot lose. I am particularly interested in the &quot;man with four faces,&quot; because of a Vision I had in 1991.... Looks like I am not the only person to ever draw The Conundrum.You will be enthralled with the Artistic Quality of this massive book and you will treasure it's contents forever. This is an absolute &quot;must-have&quot; for all Students of &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages!&quot;

I am very impressed with this Tarot kit. Not-only does it come with both the Rider-Waite deck and the Crowley Thoth deck, but the book has excellent pictures of each card, from each deck (for side-by-side comparison, without digging through each deck, to compare cards). The author points-out the diffrerences between each deck and gives a great over-view of The Tarot, with very helpful ideas for readings and layouts.Bonus materials include a Beginner's lay-out / fold-out chart, a tri-fold cheat sheet of the differences between the two decks, and a nice Tarot Journal--for keeping records of the readings, to study accuracy and ability of Tarot Reading, and to study the synchronicities you might not catch by memory alone.As the author mentions, &quot;The Book of Thoth,&quot; by Crowley (ISBN: 0877282684) is a great resource, as well. However, I strongly suggest Lon Milo Duquette's &quot;Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot&quot; (ISBN: 1578632765) as a first step after studying &quot;The Complete Tarot Kit,&quot; by Susan Levitt ....then, move-on to Crowley's Thoth Tarot book, afterward.For further research, I also suggest: &quot;The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols,&quot; by Angeles Arrien.However, save yourself some headaches and start with &quot;The Complete Tarot Kit,&quot; by Susan Levitt ! :-)

I "Believe" that "If I Could Turn Back Time" I would definitely want to be one of the extras in the sexy video! Cher hooked me with "Believe" when it was pumping through the Clubs and all over the radio for a long time after the release of this song. The song "Believe" locks-in great memories, and the video is in tune with the times; I love it. However, I would recommend purchasing this DVD if only for the "If I Could Turn Back Time" video! :-)This DVD is worth purchasing for these two videos, alone, but the entire DVD is an excellent collection. Cher songs always bring back good memories. Cher is timeless.

This series grabbed my interest, and I could not stop watching it. I've been too busy with college courses, work, and reading for my Degree path to enjoy much entertainment. However, during Xmas Break, I experienced the first DVD in the "Invasion" series, and I was completely hooked. I had to watch the entire series while I had the opportunity, then I also purchased the complete set.This is not just a Sci-Fi, action-packed, well-made and gripping story, but this is also a perfect series for anyone who has experienced alternative family situations. The interplay between lovers and ex-lovers, the bonding and issues experienced by the children, and other basic daily family issues play out in a believable, realistic manner throughout the series. As someone who has experienced even more complex family combining situations, and ex-lover becomes new lover's friend type of scenarios, I thoroughly grasped the stories within the story. I believe this series is a realistic portrayal of modern relationships (with an Alien twist).As a long time X-Files fan, and a person who enjoys good Sci-Fi, I truly enjoyed and recommend this series. I purchased this ASAP to add to my movie collection. I've never seen anything quite like the "Invasion" series, but this conjured-up memories of X-Files, The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, and other great Sci-Fi series; yet "Invasion" is very modern and contemporary, with current social commentary.In a post-Katrina U.S., this series has tapped into the underlying worries of Global Warming, government issues, "Conspiracy Theory" and a host of other issues. Basically, this series has something for everyone.I also recommend "Invasion" for people who are not interested in Sci-Fi, or the above genres, yet have experienced divorce, separation, the joining of families, and other modern (common) societal changes. This would be an excellent series to purchase for teenagers who are experiencing parental divorce, "see it isn't that bad...it could be worse...your step-mom could be an Alien!"

This is a great book to add to your collection, if you are interested in, or research, Secret Societies. It has been a long time, since I read this one, but this book gave me good reference material to research & many other books of this genre refer to Howard's book. Add it to your collection, so it will be on-hand when you see quotes in other works.The information provided by another reader is true--the information about George Washington is completely in Error in "The Occult Conspiracy." I have posted the same information in clubs, but I forgot to return to this review and Update my findings."A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry," by A.E. Waite & other sources discount much of the material in "The Occult Conspiracy."However, this books is useful as a reference book/bibliography.

If you loved him in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; you'll be amazed when you see his straight-faced comical antics in &quot;Clue.&quot; I love this movie, from beginning to end (and to end....and to end). Seeing Tim Curry in a suit seems shocking, at first, but you'll become comfortable with his clean-cut image, as he explains to his guests why they have all been invited to this Mansion in the middle of nowhere (no, not that one!). Of course, all the other people are great, also (love the maid ; ) --but, let's face it: Curry is the center of attention, no-matter how much running from room to room he does, throughout the movie! These people will keep you in stiches, all evening, and you will be talking about &quot;watching it the next time,&quot; before the tape is rewound! I've tried to order this one, where I live, and cannot find it...so, once-again, I am indebted to Amazon. As in all of Curry's movies (IT, Legend, etc.), he steals the show. Be ready for a wild comedy with great sets, fast-paced action and lots of Word-Play. Have Fun!

The Scenes are Beautiful, the story is Great, the Actors are perfect for their roles, the scenes roll smoothly and fluidly together....did I mention the Special Effects? If I write any more about this film, today, I am going to Coerce myself into watching it again! Just writing about it brings the powerful imagery flowing back into my conscious memory.... The philosophical, religious and scientific aspects of this movie are wonderful and only accentuated by the action and well-presented effects.

The Big Blue Brick is Crowley's dream come true. This is the ultimate Thelemic resource guide, which contains an in-depth Introduction to the book and the full story of the creation of 'Thelema.' This compilation contains many of Crowley's most-important works and rituals, including; "Book Four" (ISBN # 0877285136)*, "Magick in Theory and Practice" (ISBN # 0486232956)*, and "The Equinox of the Gods" (ISBN # 1561840289)--events leading up to and including the creation of 'The Book of The Law.' This book also contains numerous important 'Appendices' and a million or so footnotes that were meticulously scrutinized for accuracy.* note: be careful with 'Book Four' (in which Crowley depicts a ridiculous conception of The Scourge used in Witchcraft, legitimately) & 'Magick in Theory and Practice' (esp., due to the fact that in that time period, as now, 'morality' prevented people from talking/writing about sex, but it was/is perfectly ok to talk or write about more dangerous subjects). When reading Crowley, one must often read between the lines. Crowley had a weird sense of humor about revealing 'secrets' without revealing them--when in doubt, reread the section(s) and 'Magick Without Tears' (which shows Crowley's sense of humor and proves he was 'of sound mind' at the end of his life--a typical cranky ol' Grandpa kind guy).'Magick' is NOT light reading! This is a scholarly work that took decades to compile, and a century to be brought-together in this format. Keep in mind, purchasing this book is the equivalent of purchasing many of Crowley's books in one volume (as he originally intended)--with the added benefit of preface material, illustrations, modern research, Footnotes (!), etc. It is well-worth the price, considering the fact that all of this material is compiled in a painstaking manner, including lost material and better renditions of previous editions.However, for those who are just beginning to study Thelema, or have just begun the process of wading through Crowley's works (or just want to research Thelema in-general), I strongly suggest beginning with: "The Magick of Thelema: A Handbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley," by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 0877287783).For further research about "Thelema" and "The Book of The Law," I suggest: "The Law is For All," by Aleister Crowley (ISBN # 1561840904).

If you are a Freemason, or are even remotely interested in the subject, you should own this book....if, for no other reason than the fact that this book contains many, many full-color, full-page pictures &amp; other graphics, such as Craft Symbolism, the &quot;Tools&quot; of the Craft, Trestle Boards, etc. This book also contains an overview of Freemasonry, including some of the esoteric aspects of The Craft--even mentioning the Hermetic axiom: &quot;As Above, So Below.&quot; I honestly believe all Masons should own books like this--esp., since so many still believe in the outdated concept of not talking about Masonry....even to their own sons and daughters...or, Wives. Leave this book lying around your den or on the coffee table. I keep my copy on the top shelf of my Masonic Research Bookshelf, beside &quot;Duncans Ritual&quot; (collectors edition), The Holy Bible and my Masonic antique items. It really sets-off my little shrine to Masonry! This book has more pictures than you can shake a level at....so, stop twirling your compass and get out your credit card!

There are many reasons why I am proud to own this book, and I am delighted to find material relating to The Templars (and other Monastic Fighting Orders) in this historical &quot;expose'&quot; of Freemasonry. I am also quite happy to finally find a book that mentions &quot;The Odd Fellows.&quot; The author makes a bold claim, that he will &quot;Teach Masonry to Masons.&quot; I also thank Amazon.com for their recommendation system, which inspired my girlfriend to send me this one as a surprise! If you are caught-up in the Templar-craze, check-out this historical work and measure fact with fiction. You will not be disappointed.

This wonderful book is a Plethora of XP information and Registry Hacks, that will help the average user or IT professional. I loved the Annoyances website so much, that I invested in this hard-copy book, which has proven to be more than worth the money.I was skeptical of messing with the registry, other than basic Hacks to access certain features of Internet Explorer, at work, until I read &quot;Windows XP Annoyances,&quot; by David A. Karp.This book is not-only a great time saver, containing tons of information that will speed-up and improve your O.S., by getting-rid of &quot;Annoyances&quot; and tweaking various aspects of the system, but it will also teach you how to hack the registry. The author gives very detailed scenarios--step-by-step, explaining how to do basic registry hacks, then how to put all those hacks together into a script. From there, you can use your imagination.This book will make you feel more confident that you will not blow-up your O.S. with some tweaking and it provides information about various applications that do most of the tweaking for you, if goofing with the registry scares you.I have recommended this book to numerous friends in the IT industry. The site is very helpful, as-well --especially, in a pinch, or on days when there is too much blood in your Caffeine system.

This book is definitive proof that the Hypocrisy of our Society, &quot;teachers&quot; and religious leaders (major and minor) is scarring humanity. Fundamentalists hate Marylin Manson....well, They Created him. I have struggled to understand the Warped view of religion that I have seen, throughout my life...leading me to read voraciously in areas of Spirituality, Anthropology, etc.--and I have always been fascinated with Musicians. Marylin Manson has proven, conclusively, that the &quot;morals&quot; we are taught are not remotely Humanitarian in nature. Society is based on how we present ourselves to others....not how we Truly are, or believe. This book shows the Obsessive, Demented way in which we are instructed to live our lives....leading to Repression, Psychosis and all manner of weirdness. Marylin Manson simply tells it like it really IS, instead-of lying abuot the Reality of how messed-up our Culture has become. He does not paint a pretty picture, with white picket fences...he informs you what goes-on in the basement, behind closed doors. This man sees that few people are raising their children in a manner that is conducive to creating intelligent, enlightenend human beings.... So, he is giving the confused masses a forum to vent their frustration. I love Anthropology and attended the Louisville, Ky concert that the locals fought against, radically....until the camera crews left the streets. Thousands of &quot;religious&quot; people shouted that this man would kill us, or turn us into satanists....but, not ONE person waited to see if we survived. I guess the camera crews didn't stay long-enough..... This book may inspire you to study Psychology and pursue Positive Methods of raising children and teaching children in schools, religious groups, etc. Fanatical adherence to Dogma can create a monster.... You hate in others, what you despise in yourself---Food for thought.

I have been watching this guy, for a long time, now. Many people try to discredit him, because they cannot handle the truth. However, I believe that one day Hancock will be fully recognized for his Search for The Truth. In Fact, I dare-say THE SPHINX is THE KEY to unlock the past and Future of humankind. Perhaps, it is time for Punctuated Equilibrium. I was especially interested in pages 210-211....

Gender Bending, Crossdressing, Transsexualism, Shemales, Drag Queens, Female Impersonators, Homosexuals and Lesbians, Transvestites, Intersexed Individuals, and Transgendered Individuals of all flavors are discussed; Terminology is explained in order to reduce confusion. In fact,Confusion is also covered.Motivations for crossdressing are discussed, and Sexual Orientation (vs. Gender Identity) is explained. This book reveals and explains many aspects of Transgendered behavior, activities, and Needs (psychological, emotional, physical, etc.). Social Stigma is discussed, and the need of support groups is covered. Many Resources are given at the back of the book (see below).I recommendTrue Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionalsto all those who are interested in the subjects, and to those listed in the title, but I strongly recommend this book for ANYONE with "Gender Issues" (Gender Identity problems, worries, desires, confusion, et al.). I truly wish that I would have had this book a long time ago. I had to piece it all together from Nursing books, psychology texts, magazine articles, research, books, long talks with people of various "Alternative" lifestyles, and by experimentation. I even dated a Transsexual, and had long talks with her about these subjects. From everything that I have learned and from everything I learned vicariously through Transsexuals, I highly recommend True Selves as a starting point or as a great resource guide for TG/TS/TV/CD and others who know, are related to, or work with these individuals!Aside from the fantastic amount of information and quotes from those who have been in therapy (many stories correlated to my experiences as a child, teen, and adult), and the wonderful advice about therapy,seeking much needed assistance, and finding ways to "cope" then take action to live a better life, this book also contains something I have not encountered previously:NAMES and ADDRESSES of Organizations which help Transsexuals.Regardless of whether a person is simply confused, suicidal, MTF, or FTM, transgendered, etc., these resources and organizations are available to help a person remain with us, find help, find therapists, find the rightdoctors.... heck, even find Shoes!This is a list of the Organizations given at the back of the book, and if you purchase the book you will have the Addresses, Phone Numbers, Contact information, and a bonus list of Web Sites so you can access morevalid information without trolling the Internet or logging numerous searches into your work station computer, during break time or lunch.Not only will you avoid leaving a Tranny Trail on your work PC, but this book gives several good examples of "coming out" letters and information about Transitioning at work; job related issues are explained, in detail. In fact, True Selves also provides sample Feedback from "coming out" letters and strategies for coming out to parents, family, and friends. One idea was very good--impressive--but you can buy the book to discover the idea.I really believe that most people should read this book, becauseTrue Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionalsdeflates the ignorant stance of those who would be nasty about such a situation.Books that I have read in the past discussed a LOT of negativity andhorrible treatment of "Trannies," but this book shows that a tremendous amount of Progress has been made to give Transsexuals basic human rights, and even decent bathroom access. I am quite impressed by how much haschanged since I began researching this subject in the early '90s! It seems that there is not as much to fear as previously reported. The Internet is probably contributing to more enlightened views, but also True Selves shows that those who persevered in the past created a better working environment, better laws, better working conditions, etc.Overall,True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionalsis good news for anyone with "Gender Issues," and I personally find the book to be a great relief as I research to figure out personal matters.Nearly every subject related to Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and the need to be the opposite sex is covered in this book. Anyone involved with Psychology, Sociology, the public, employees, or "Alternative" people should at least peruse this book, but I believe that Transgendered Individuals of all flavors will get the most out of this book. In fact, if anything goes awry with the suggestions in the book (i.e., if ignorance prevails), you can hand this book to the person, and point out a section. Often, if people are forced to see that something is a Medical Condition, their attitude changes. If not....Here is a list of resources that will be available to you, if you purchase the book;Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA)American Educational Gender Information Service (AEGIS)Gender Education and Advocacy (GEA)The International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE)FTM InternationalIntersex Society of North America (ISNA)Renaissance Transgender Association, Inc.Parents, Family & Friends of Lesbians & Gays (PFLAG)Ingersoll Gender CenterLavender Youth Recreation and Information Center (LYRIC)Transfamily of ClevelandTransGender San FranciscoMermaids...and a list of websites (with Ph.D credentials, etc.).For a long while, I had this on my wish list (hidden), but I was concerned about coworkers, friends, and college students seeing my research choices. However I have discovered that most people (even in college) are not that bright, nor worth suppressing your natural inclinations to appease. If you but the book, you can always hide the purchase on your list. ;-) I study Psychology, in college and on my own, and I am very impressed with this book and the way it handles the subjects. This list of resources, alone, is worth the purchase price. Honestly, I wish I would have had this book ten years ago.Note:True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionalsmay appear to be only for those listed in the title, but it speaks to the person with Transgender issues, and is definitely written with those individuals in mind. Regardless of where you stand (curious, questioning, Knowing, TS, TV, TG, CD, or whatever the case) this book is a fantastic resource guide and could be a godsend to teenagers or young adults with Gender Identity issues. No matter what age you are, however, this book is written to speak to everyone, and is very respectful to all individuals.

This is a great guide to Tattoo culture, history, styles, effects upon society, et al. Also included is a listing of Tattoo shops all-over the world. Of course, this listing is outdated, but should give anyone with Internet access all they need to get started. For instance, &quot;Tattoo Charlie's&quot; is a famous Louisville, KY based shop that only had a few branches, when this book was written. Now, however, Tattoo Charlie's has spread all-over Louisville, Southern Indiana, etc.At the time this book was written, Tattoing was illegal in IN. Now, we have numerous shops available, which can be found by a web search, or asking-around.Although this book is out-of date, it contains a concise history of the Tattoo, the people who get tattooed, various methods of tattoing, many black and white photos, and a middle section of Full-Color photos. This book is loaded with pics and includes photos of famous tattooed individuals. At the time this book was written, every other Holllywood star did not have a Tat, so it was interesting, circa the creation of the book. Consider this a &quot;Pre Dennis Rodman -era&quot; Tattoo book.The Total Tattoo book even covers the implications of &quot;Cosmetic Tattooing.&quot;

I am very impressed with this book! I found "Modern Sex Magick" very difficult to put-down. I am a little surprised that certain sections are espoused as more controversial than others (e.g., Polyamorous Sex Magick being more controversial than Homosexual Sex Magick)--however, society is weird like that.... Regardless, the material in this book would be quite useful to nearly anyone--not just Magickians or sex magick practitioners.Personally, I learned a lot about Sex Magick from this individual's research of the subject. The author helps dispel many of the rumors and much of the disinformation about the practice of sex magick. I did not read about the subject for many years, due to misinformation from an organization I formerly studied with (and the silly claims against Sex Magick, in the back of the original "Light of Egypt" books associated with that organization), so this subject is new to me--although "Sex" and "Magick" separately are quite familiar subjects.Considering the fact that I have experienced some indoctrination against the practice of Sex Magick, I truly enjoyed the author's honest, helpful attempt to reveal the truth about Sex Magick and also give other perspectives (e.g., from various women involved in the practice), by including essays from other practitioners, instead of just espousing one theory or perspective on the subject.I found the rituals to mostly follow the same, basic format, but the book is very interesting and very informative--especially, for a person just beginning to research this system of Magick. The book is well-illustrated, comprehensive and full of common sense applications of different styles of Sex Magick (including safe explanations and illustrations of S&M; practices). It is obvious that the author made a great effort to fully explain the material, instead of leaving the safety of the reader in question.Having previously studied much in the areas of; sex, magick, polyamorous relationships, etc., I had to give this book a good review and will also place it on my "Polyamory, "Open Relationships" & New Age Sexuality" Listmania list.I also recommend this book to Thelemites.

Entertaining. Not accurate, but has nice illustrations. I purchased this for the 'Vodou Pentacle' ( Web ) pic. I have a friend with a tattoo of the 'Vodou Pentacle' and I respect the concept, as explained to me, by an Initiate.However, the book, itself.... well, it is mis-titled. This book is a slap-dash, thrown-together collection of "stuff." If you are looking for a book about "Voodoo Rituals," this isn't what you are looking for. Yet, it is entertaining and has some useful tidbits about various (not voodoo or Vodou) magickal entities and whatnot. I would not recommend buying this book because of the title--which is misleading. Some of the stuff in this book, I would consider "Hoodoo" and, maybe "Voodoo," but not "Vodou."I agree with the person who said this appears to be a "Personal Journal." I just do not understand why so many Magickal systems are lumped-together under the title of the book.

I am surprised that this book is &quot;out of print!&quot; When I read this book, in '93, I was compelled to finish it in a few days, although I had little time to read. Taliesin is an epic adventure in Mythology, Legend, Oral Tradition and many other areas of interest. I recently loaned it out and my friend devoured it! Anyone interested in The Mysteries, History, Celtic Lore, etc. will find this book worthy of searching-for. Also, you may want to grab a copy of &quot;The Mabinogi And Other Welsh Tales,&quot; by Patrick K. Ford.

The DreamWeaver / Fireworks combo is an Amazing &amp; Wonderful way to design webpages, graphics, Retouch Photos, etc. I love my Adobe Photoshop, but nothing compares to Fireworks, for the Detailed work, converting Images to High Res/low K images that do not Bore surfers, waiting for the page to load (average give-up time = 30 seconds). With Fireworks, you can tweak your graphics, until they are Perfect, but keep the SIZE of the graphic down to a minimum, thus increasing your webpage hits, astronomically.My wife is a Web Designer / Artist / Graphic Artist, who has trained at Lynda Weinman.com ( ISBN # 1562059491 ) in beautiful &quot;Ojai, CA.&quot; My wife swears-by Fireworks &amp; Dreamweaver.Luckily, I learned a lot of the tricks of the trade &amp; I was astounded at how-often I needed Fireworks &amp; Dreamweaver in the profession I held (until I turned to IT), as a &quot;Document Specialist.&quot;In today's world of High-Tech, Online Docs, etc., even Administrative Assistants need Dreamweaver &amp; Frieworks. As a Document Specialist, I used Dreamweaver daily, for a long time.Fireworks, comes in-handy, as well, when the A.A.'s need to scan a Signature for their Boss, for documents.Be the only person on your floor, who knows how to use Fireworks, and you will make yourself a much-needed employee. Your Signature scans will look better than everyone-else's and you may have a bit more job security.Fireworks &amp; Dreamweaver are not Just for Web Geeks &amp; Gurus. Anyone who works in an Office environment should know these programs, and use them regulalry. Fireworks is the Greatest Graphics program I have ever used.

This is Not just another "the Teenagers are gonna get it" flick. Gruesome best describes the movie. You may feel as if the movie is never going to start, and I literally thought, "ok, ok, you are trying to establish tension between the two chics and the due....fine, get ON with it...." However, after the initial scenes which get the movie off to a slow start (though camera trickery is used to attempt to overcome this problem), the movie actually begins.Once the movie truly starts, and the basic plot lines are established (character tension, etc.), the movie sucked me in, grabbed me by the gonads, and didn't let go. Once the Freddy Kruger of Australia enters the story, all hell breaks loose.I was very surprised by the gruesome and horrific scenes in this movie. I reviewPias "Disturbing," but that was on a different level. Wolf Creek is truly Disturbing, because of the detail of the horrific scenes, the cold blooded ruthlessness....but even more so because it seems so real. This movie leaves you wondering about solo hiking trips and other adventures. Can't say I'll be touring Australia any time soon.If you like the newThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning - Unrated (New Line Platinum Series)movies, you will probably enjoy Wolf Creek.

This is a very useful book to have on-hand, near your Tarot collection. Sometimes, digging through Crowley's rants and digressions can be a bit time-consuming. It's nice to have a quick, easy reference guide to the Thoth deck. I have not yet compared the Crowley material to this book, but I have not noticed anything that seemed &quot;off,&quot; while using &quot;Keywords for the Crowley Tarot&quot; as a reference, while doing readings.I have noticed that most Newbies to the Thoth deck latch-onto this book, like a Prize ! Then, I return it to the shelf and tell them the ISBN #, so they can get their own copy.I'll, do a more thorough review, in the future. For now, I just want to give the authors Kudos for their work.

Watching the Metamorphosis of Brian Warner into Marilyn Manson, and The Anti-Christ (one face, anyway) is an experience well worth viewing. When I watched this, my opinion of the DVD was "ok," but in context and after thinking about the other VHS and DVD materials available I must recommend this.My perception of this DVD was created, at first, as a comparison with Marilyn Manson's live performances, videos, etc. However, this DVD gives us the raw footage of his transformation, and considering his budget (or lack thereof) he did one hell of a job putting on a real SHOW.This is the gritty, raw, early years material....before the elaborate concerts and massive props. Watching him "make do" with what he had available is fascinating, and the more you think about his stage sets the more you can appreciate his brilliance. Marilyn Manson could turn a garage sale into a stage set. He is certainly a real showman.

Journey with Stile, in a world of High-Tech--Juxtaposed with a Realm of Fantasy and Magick. Experience a world in-which you are not allowed to wear clothing (unless absolutely necessary), if you are not among the Elite...and a piece of Lingerie is a treasure to be kept safe, like gold or diamonds in our own world. Our hero is a man of Sports and a contender not-only in games and Olympic feats, but of quests in magickal lands... trying to survive assassination on both planes of existence! Even crossing-over is a danger to his life. This is very adventurous reading, with Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy...Futuristic, High-Tech &amp; Magickal, Low-Tech scenarios...combined in a flowing epic of self-discovery and Mastership. You may have noticed, that I did not review the first book of the series (&quot;SPLIT INFINITY&quot;) and opted for &quot;BLUE ADEPT,&quot; instead.... Well, the cover of this book attracted me to the series (Glad it hasn't changed :) --So, I went with my...instincts...on this issue. Anyway, all the books are great! Make sure you don't forget &quot;JUXTAPOSITION,&quot; or you will be left hangin' until you receive the next purchase. I loved the series and I suggest searching for all of Piers Anthony's novels.... This is a guy you can't go wrong with. So, there you have it--Introductory Course: How to Live in 2 Worlds, Simultaneously!

The shade of Allanon requests a gathering of the few people in the world that can attempt to prevent certain destruction of all that is known. He reveals the Future...and it is Darkness. Only a tiny band of beings can bring The Light to humankind...before all is lost. They must bring salvation to the masses, or see the end of civilization. Only the last of the Druids can help save the world...with help from a band of chosen ones. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment. His writing is very enticing...his words draw you into the story, and you cannot escape his world. Tolkien got me through Middle school and Terry Brooks helped me survive High School, although I must admit I read Tolkien again and again--however, Terry Brooks is the only author I feel that I can mention beside the name of the master. This novel is not a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; nock-off, it is completely original. If you are looking for copy-cat stories, you should look else-where--although, the series does contain some of the same creatures and humanoids (sort-of), they are very original and exciting. I agree with the Future scenario, because of certain buildings and such that are encountered during the journey....our world devastated and rebuilt with Magick. One aspect of Brook's series that I feel very attracted to is the character Allanon, a Druid that sleeps for centuries or decades and awakens when he is needed. I have always felt a strong connection with this character.... Interestingly, this mysterious character guards a secret Storehouse of Knowledge and strives to save humankind from the Demonic Forces that want the world to live in Ignorance and Despair.

Ellenroh searches for her heritage and her Race, in a world of madness, constantly under attack from forces that wish to rip her apart. This one will make your teeth clench, as you travel with her, on the journey to reclaim her people--lost to the world of mankind.

I work in the IT / Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals, especially those who have little familiarity with computer systems, internal structures, gadgets and whatnots.I found the detailed and heavily-illustrated sections regarding chipsets, processors, memory buffers, etc. to be very helpful. Most computer manuals are very technical and assume you know a computer inside and out, already (despite constant development in the industry and the fact that by the time a computer hits the shelves it is out-dated).These &quot;How Computers / Internet,&quot; etc. books are wonderful manuals for those who just want to know &quot;how the heck does this crazy thing work, anyway ?!?!&quot;You won't be able to pass your A+ Certifications with this series of books, but you will understand much of the jargon people throw-around in the office, and you will see flow charts of &quot;How Computers Work.&quot;I sincerely appreciated the diagrams of a Techtronix Printer!Suffice to Say, if &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words,&quot; this book is pricesless for the novice and very helpful for the beginning (uncertified) Techs in the computer repair field. The usual Black &amp; White Illustrations in computer manuals aren't exactly condusive to really getting a feel for the stuff you might be yanking out and replacing. However, this book is full of numerous full-color, full-page illustrations.

I often think of this Classic tale of Intrigue, Fantasy, Sex, Slavery, and Freedom--set in a Romanesque Empire, in a harsh world of Constant Struggle for Survival.I read this book approximately ten years ago, and I still think about it often. Richard Adams writes a very Compelling tale that should be placed among the Greats, such as Tolkien. Unfortunately, when I was young, I turned books in for credit on new books and I have not seen a copy since that time. I searched for this book, today, to make absolutely sure I have a copy for my library.I cannot wait to share this book with others, and I strongly hope it stays in print. This novel deserves far more shelf space that it receives.I have never forgotten the Characters in "Maia." They are truly well-written and the story grabs you, pulls you in and does not let-go. This is one of those rare books that you do not want to End.Lately, I have been reading "The Light Bearer," and it reminds me of "Maia." It seems anyone who likes one would like the other. "Maia" has that Romanesque feel, in the capitol city--and other, even more Dangerous lands are explored.This is an Epic Adventure Tale, that you will never forget.

I accidentally dismissed this book, because of the cover, until my wife brought me a copy to peruse. The cover doesn't really do the book justice--although, I am sure it sells many copies, normally. If this book had an entirely different cover, I believe it would be taken Very Seriously by many students of The Mysteries, Anthropology (especially), and could possibly be used in a College Course on Mythology.Greer's explanation of Occult, Ghost, UFO, Fay, etc., Phenomena makes more sense than most of what I have read on the subject, throughout my life. I have read Secret School materials that do not make as much sense as this amazing treatise on the Paranormal. I am especially Impressed with the UFO-Fairy connection. This theory not only makes tremendous sense, but resolves Numerous issues I have experienced and debated, over the years. For those who research the Paranormal and have experienced UFO, Ghost and such "Otherworld" activities, this book makes tremendous sense, and often makes the reader realize things in a very ( "So, that's it !" ) revelatory manner.I could have really used this book, when I was younger and silly-enough to go looking for trouble. Throughout my life, I have experienced various Hauntings and Paranormal Events, and often went looking for them, as Inspiration for writing books. Personal experience leads me to conclude that Greer is an Expert and should be taken very Seriously by Anthropologists, Psychologists, et al.I doubt that most people who are not psychically inclined or Initiated will "get it," but this guide is Certainly well-worth owning just to discourage people from "Dabbling" in Occult Matters. Amazingly, this is the first "Occult" book I have ever read that would be perfect material for Christians to encourage their teenagers to read. The usual Christian theory of "Don't Dabble" (in the Occult) is repeated throughout the book. However, the book is written from an Initiated, Mystical perspective, coinciding with Common Sense.To make a long review short.... This is a perfect guide to "Monsters" (the Paranormal, Mystical, Hauntings, Vampires, Werewolves, etc.) that should be on the shelf of every "Occultist," Christian, Psychic, Psychologist and Anthropologist.Please, do not "judge the book by it's cover." This is not a sensationalist, copy-cat, or un-researched book written to capitalize on Vampire Trends and such. I sincerely expect this book to make it's way into college courses. Greer has obviously researched this material in-depth and first-hand. This is the only Serious work on the subject that I have encountered. If you are expecting sensationalized UFO encounters, this book isn't for you. However, this book does explain, Rationally, the UFO phenomena. This book does not "debunk" monsters, ghosts and fairies--but, it does Explain them, logicallyGreer obviously has the Credentials to back-up his theories. "Monsters" is being used as a "Reference book" at Libraries (a book you cannot check-out: "for Research purposes, only").For those who may be interested, several chapters included in this book involve Natural Magick and Ritual Magick, with detailed instructions and diagrams.

This Collection of peaceful songs will create a soothing space, allowing anyone to relax and de-stress. I often used this CD collection to stay focused, while keying data in an office environment. At home, you can create a scared space, with soothing Chants and songs that carry you away from the hectic world around us. There are many rare gems in this collection, that I always find fascinating! If you enjoy Enya, Enigma, Cusco, Native or Instrumental music, you will enjoy this great CD. I have listened to it countless times.

Ok, although I worked in a movie store, and I am usually a good judge of films (thus no need to review movies less than 3 stars, generally)...I bought it for the cover and a few previews.I thought that this movie would be an intense, butt kicking, action packed film with a hot chic superhero cutting her way through obstacles. This movie has not left as strong of an impression in my mind, as most films do. I only vaguely recall the plot and some rather boring scenes.Don't get me wrong, the actress is hot, and she does a little butt kicking, but if you want action I'd recommend movies with Milla Jovovich, such asUltraviolet (Unrated, Extended Cut),Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray], etc., or Kate Beckinsale;Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray],Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition), and obscure flicks such asBloodrayne (Unrated Director's Cut)(DVD ROM game is included).Elektra was not very electrifying. I give it a "watch it once" rating, but I was not very impressed with the movie.

I nearly wore my CD out, several years ago. "Mad Sex" is swingin', and this album makes you want to sing along (as if anyone could sing as well as Prince). "Until U're in My Arms Again" is a ballad; beautiful tune. "When You Love Somebody" is hip, and sticks in your head. This album creates a fun, frivolous mood. I own nearly all of Prince's albums, and I plan to own them all. I am genuinely surprised that this one has not been reviewed, yet. I will take time to review my collection, soon."New Power Soul" is a lively CD that may have you dancing around or tapping rhythms on household items or the dashboard. If you dig this one, step it up withThe Gold Experience; "P control" is worth gold. ;-)

Ok, so I'm an English major, and my Psych Prof disses Eminem, but I dig it. I thoroughly enjoy this CD, and it has not been removed from the car CD player for days. Personally, I think there is a lot more going on in Eminem's head than he gets credit for. As a student of Anthropology and Psychology, I also detect a lot of Social Commentary in his work. He seems to be sort-of a musical equivalent of Stephen King (another guy who received little credit for his genius for a long time).Don't tell the Professors, but I recommend Eminem (aka "Slim Shady"); this CD is groovin' and addictive. He has a unique flow and rhyme scheme. I also recommend his other works and videos.

Hero has Fantastic Cinematography, Choreography, an Amazing story, and Brilliant film production. This is a masterful film, and a movie to treasure. I also recommend purchasingHouse of Flying Daggers. For those who somehow missedCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I suggest adding that to your wish list, as well.I was only slightly interested in martial arts films, untilCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonwas created, butHouse of Flying DaggersandHerohave expanded my interests. These movies are truly masterful productions, and they have inspired many other beautiful films. This genre is unique and highly recommended.If the name Quentin Tarantino freaks you out, or makes you think only of Gore, Violence, and potty mouths....relax. This is different: not his usual fare. Personally, I love Quentin Tarantino movies, but I can understand why some people might avoid HERO, due to his other work. No worries; this is not what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino. He is a genius, and this movie fits well with the genre of oriental / martial arts / beautiful cinematography films listed above.Don't judge the movie by the name on the cover, but by the reviews and images on the cover. You will be impressed, amazed, and gain a new respect for Quentin Tarantino.

This book cracked me up. I read this in one sitting, and nearly fell off the couch, laughing. The &quot;poetry&quot; is absolutely atrocious, but the book is so funny the &quot;poetic&quot; curses are forgivable. I bought this kit as a joke, and found the helpful booklet to be amazing Stress Therapy.I didn't really need to poke anyone in the eye--the book relieves your stress with humorous scenarios of revenge, listed in a convenient format which enables quick-reference for various situations that may arise. Feeling Stressed? Yeah, me too. The doll isn't really necessary, but it makes a great statement. Have this delivered to your workplace and open it at your desk, during lunch!The author conveniently provides instructions for making your own &quot;Voodoo&quot; doll, in-case one isn't enough.

As a long-time Tolkien Fan and a person who has read The Trilogy three times, I must say I was absolutely astounded and captivated by the new Tolkien movie, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;I am very proud of the Producers, Directors, Actors, et al ! It seemed as-if everyone had read the trilogy and understood their parts, not just memorized lines form a script. The scenes were amazing! Hobbiton has been brought to life in a way I really did not believe could be accomplished on film. The Shire lives and breathes and will inspire thousands of people to read Tolkien's works.This film series brings the world of Tolkien to the big screen and into people's homes like never before. This is wonderful! I had to sneak the books home and hide them under the bed &amp; pretend to be reading something-else, so my Mom wouldn't catch me. Now, teenagers can just sneak out for a night of Magick and Adventure.I was a bit disappointed with the portrayal of the male elves--they seemed to be a bit too &quot;human&quot; and less ethereal (and wise) than they are portrayed in the books. However, over-all, I believe this movie portrays the characters in the Trilogy better than most people can imagine.Luckily, the film is more fast-paced than the Trilogy, and most of the important scenes are retained. However, I still believe reading the Trilogy is crucial to understanding the film (and who wants to wait an entire year for the next chapter, so to speak?). This film will bring a whole new generation to the world of Tolkien (and, Hopefully, a new generation of Book-Lovers).I am so impressed with this film, that I have nothing negative to say, whatsoever.....and this coming from someone who's Wife quoted Tolkien on our Wedding Invitations !

My history Professor often begins courses by stating that in order to understand our present we must study the past. I doubt that he would recommend this series of DVDs, but he was Intel and I study many "secret" subjects. I do not bother explaining anything, because people would just call me a "conspiracy theorist" (instead of thinking).However view these for yourself, correlate the extra info with what is known, delve into some secret society stuff, and see what you think.Currently, I see enough evidence of a continuing "Reich" to take it all a bit more seriously than some folks who would discount the information. Ever wonder if Hitler was as much a tool as a Despot? Regardless, these documentaries will give a little insight into some of the Symbolism and Ideology of Hitler's Third Reich, and you might accidentally make some connections with historical information.I've studied in many secret societies and magickal orders, yet I also study collegiate and academic resources. Personally, I think that these films are worth viewing and considering in context of "historical fact."

Obviously, this movie is a &quot;Chick Flick&quot; &amp; &quot;Romantic Comedy.&quot; So, your wife / girlfriend / consort, or &quot;significant other&quot; must twist your arm to get you to put the Action-Adventure movie down and stick this one in the VCR/DVD player, right? WRONG. This movie is Fun, Sexy, Magickal...and the Male Hero is a Texas Ranger! So stop whining about wanting to watch Mel Gibson's latest movie or Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest flick and Cuddle-Up with your &quot;significant other&quot; for a new kind of Adventure.... There is even an &quot;Evil Bad Guy&quot; in this movie (betcha didn't think you'd see much &quot;Action,&quot; huh? Well...get ready for a surprisingly fast-paced &quot;Chick Flick.&quot;) You'll be singin' the &quot;Midnight Marguerita&quot; song and dancin' around with her broom, before the evening is over! My &quot;significant other&quot; is a Wiccan / Actress / Ex-Librarian, so she prefers the Book (wich she says is written very Poetically) to the movie.... But, we had a lot of Fun watching the film, together. I recommend this movie to everyone, Including Guys!

Working in the IT field, I found this book to be very helpful-- especially from a historical perspective--explaining the various highspeed options available. I read this, although I have been trouble-shooting highspeed issues on a helpdesk, for a long time. When studying for Network +, I read references about T1 lines, and other methods of highspeed access that I have never used, personally, or only used in a corporate office invironment, as a User.This book explains all the (mostly out-dated, in heavily populated areas) technologies, and helps to grasp the basics when studying for the Network+ certification.

Other reviewers have covered plot lines and the gist of this movie, however I enjoyed this film and I sent the purchasing information to many friends. This film is rather graphic (not gory, but sexually graphic), yet the combination of "discourses on existentialism" connected with sexuality and "satire on the Bush administration" is interesting.This movie is trippy. I watched "The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai" straight, but I would recommend having a margarita before watching it. This is sort-of like a new style of '70s B movie, and unlike anything else that I have seen; therefore, this movie is difficult to categorize. I agree with another reviewer that John Waters fans would probably enjoy this film. Also, people who enjoy obscure movies such as "The Rocky Horror Picture Show (25th Anniversary Edition)" will probably like "The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai."The send-up of "W" (from a Japanese perspective) is very strange and worth watching. If you read between the lines, during a certain scene in which "W's" cloned finger goes on an adventure....well, let us suffice to say that That One Scene summarizes a World View of the current situation.Some of the more delicate folks might need to fast-forward through the sex scenes, but I am letting people know about this movie , because you probably will not see much publicity about this film. PALM PICTURES produces such films as "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things" (which has a Marylin Manson cameo).Mark Schilling, of the Japan Times, states that this movie is "A weird, hilarious wet dream for intellectuals!" I agree. This movie would also cause some serious wet dreams if teenagers got their hands on it. This is definitely one to keep away from the children, yet the movie is fun for adults. I have a feeling that many people will skip to certain scenes and show those particular scenes during parties and get-togethers.If you have the slightest clue about what is going on in the world you will enjoy the non-sexual aspects of the film. I will definitely watch this film again, most-likely after having a margarita, and I will share scenes with friends so that they will acquire their own copy.I believe this film could become a Cult Classic amongst the Philosophical and Intellectual crowd. Many activists and Alternative Thinkers will enjoy "The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai" as well. Having sampled this film, I have purchasedThe Heart Is Deceitful Above All Thingsfrom PALM PICTURES.

I purchased this album, based upon movie experiences....I passed upHouse of 1,000 Corpses, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome. I never rented it. However, I watchedThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and loved the movie. A coworker explained that this was a "part two" ofHouse of 1,000 Corpses, so I gave it a chance.I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves. I also purchased the following items related to this flick;House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics),House of 1,000 Corpses, and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own. I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.Troll Amazon for "Rob Zombie" and "White Zombie." He never disappoints.

Where do I begin! Ok, when I first saw this book, I thought... hmm, maybe...money is tight. Then, one day I just grabbed it and took it home. Imagine my surprise, when I discovered the author has a section called &quot;Reconstructing the Temple of Solomon with Philosopher's Stones,&quot; followed by &quot;The rose, the cross, and the mysteries&quot;...&amp; &quot;Atavisms and Illuminati !&quot; At that point, I was Hooked. I have ALWAYS been interested in Psychology and I have read many books on the subject. Ten years ago, I read &quot;The Occult,&quot; by Colin Wilson, which informs the reader about Jung's split with Freud and (if I remember correctly) has a copy of a letter from Freud, warning Jung not to get involved with the occult and trying to steer him away from the direction he was going with his work.... Well, THIS book, by Noll, really digs into Jung's work and explains his psychic experimentation, relationship with his Ancestors and various methods employed to reach into his Heritage and draw-forth the tools of Modern Psychology. No wonder some Christians believe Psychology is the work of the devil....nearly all of Jung's work is based upon Occult (Hidden) Principles and Paganism. The Sub-Title of this book says it all : &quot;The Secret Life of Carl Jung.&quot; Obviously, he had to play-down the influence of the occult in his work, in his public life...but, this book takes a look behind the scenes and also explains how Jung acquired his funding--this part is important, so I won't spoil it. I was excited to find-out that his family was involved with Freemasonry and that Masonic Symbolism was added to the Family Crest. This book is, truly, an exciting read...from a psychological, historical, anthropological, occult, Masonic or &quot;just curious&quot; point-of-view. If I had realized how great this book was, I would have acquired it much sooner!

I have been deeply immersed in the study of Masonry, since 1991, via books. I have enjoyed studying the History of the organization and I have many books by and about Freemasons, lining my shelves. I purchased a copy of this book before several High-Degree Freemasons recommended "Born in Blood" to me, along with books by Mackey, Manly P. Hall and all the Greats of the Fraternal Order, prior to by becoming a member of the Honorable Fraternity. Personally, if these High-Degree Masons had not recommended the book ("Born in Blood"), I would still count it as one of my favorite books of all time (I have read voraciously all of my life). I could not put this book down....nor could I put "Dungeon Fire And Sword" (Robinson) down....or, "A Pilgrim's Path." (Robinson). My copy of "Born in Blood" and the other John J. Robinson books are proudly on display, next to "The History of Freemasonry" (Mackey) & "A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry" (Waite) on my Masonic Research bookshelf. I highly recommend Robinson's books to anyone interested in The Craft, or in the history of the world. I find his writing absolutely fascinating and exciting...and I love the way he ends chapters!Note: I loved this book & "A Pilgrim's Path" so much that I joined the FM and took my first degree in June. For those who do not know, this is a RE-WRITE of my original review, written last year. I had to fix a couple of things in my review, by deleting a few lines. Additionally, I have learned that John J. Robinson received the 33rd degree, in Freemasonry, because of his research and involvement with the organization. His research led him to the same conclusion, that it led me.... Where do I sign-up? "Born in Blood" earned Robinson the 33 and paved the way for the current wave of Masonic Education.

I have worked with this deck for many years, and I must say that it gives very accurate results. I do not think it is a great Beginner's Deck (try Rider-Waite for that, or purchase one of the books mentioned below)--however, the woman who created this deck infused a wealth of information into the Artwork.The Major Arcana are quite Beautiful and the Esoteric Symbolism worked into the Deck, throughout, is a Wealth of Knowledge. The placement of two Major Arcana cards are different than most standard decks, but comparable with a set of Egyptian Tarot Cards, from another Mystery school (and, as I have been informed by a reader of my reviews, many decks previous to this era, had the same attributions).As with all things in life, it is best to investigate many different branches of this field of study, but I know that Most of the Tarot Readers I have met use The Thoth Deck more than any other deck in their collection. The Wonderful Artwork and Fascinating Symbolism give the Reader a vast-array of information to draw-from. My Wife is a locally renowned Tarot Reader and she swears by this deck, for accuracy....and, ALL of her friends swear by her Accuracy.The Thoth Deck has some Great Companion Books, such as: "The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols," by Angeles Arrien --and, of course, "The Book of Thoth" by Aleister Crowley, Frieda Harris (Illustrator).I suggest buying the hand-sized Deck, because Large Decks are usually very cumbersome and it is hard to get a good psychokenetic feel for the cards. It is always best to have a deck that can be easily manipulated in the hands, for better accuracy in readings.Thousands of people believe this is the best deck on the market, and I am one of them.I also highly recommend Lon Duquette's Ceremonial Tarot Deck, to be used in conjunction with The Thoth Deck.

This movie is disturbing, yet it is a classic because it is powerful. Neuroses, Obsessive behavior, and mind boggling compulsions flow through the dark scenes. Watch it straight, or you'll probably have flashbacks. This movie is trippy. Insanity and bodily betrayals prevent the mathematician from dealing well with reality, though he seems hell bent on proving the mathematical foundations of reality.Kabbalists, Occultists, thinkers, and philosophers will dig this one. Stoners beware: paranoia pervades. As a psychology student, the film reveals a steady descent into madness, but is the guy mad or extremely focused on his work? All creative people are a little crazy, but this guy is scary. I am still not sure how to evaluate the main character of the movie, but it makes people think so I recommend it.

I can honestly say that these films changed my life. When &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; came out, I went to see it with a group of other youngsters, followed by a visit to a local Museum that was displaying a Mummy in a glass case. That day decided my future! I had the Indiana Jones Action Figure and everything. These movies inspired me to grow-up and become involved with Anthropology. I have always studied the subject on my own and I am attempting to go to school for a degree...then move on to Egyptology. Of course, real-life is not as exciting as these action-packed films, but it is just as Mentally Stimulating as the Indiana Jones series! These movies are not only thought-provoking and Fun, but they represent the beginnings of the &quot;Special Effects&quot; revolution in the movie Industry. There is absolutely no doubt that these movies are Classics &amp; I place the boxed set on my &quot;Top-Ten&quot; list. However, I must admit, the second movie: &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; fell-short of my expectations, after years of idolizing &quot;Raiders&quot;--yet, the third film: &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,&quot; more than made-up for the disappointment &amp; restored my faith in the series! I had to own the Boxed Set, because I have spent enough money renting these movies, over the years, to pay for them several times! Save your money &amp; buy the set now! This is Harrison Ford &amp; Sean Connery, folks...you can't go wrong! I have heard rumors of a fourth movie in the works.... Could it be true?!

Because I study collegiate history and mystical orders, secret societies and such, I thought this book and "revisionist history" would be interesting. However, this book is poorly researched, and the terminology is inconsistent. Having previously studied many of the subjects and organizations mentioned in this book, it is easy for me to see that the author either only skims or deliberately obfuscates both the terms he uses and the connections he professes to exist between various organizations and agencies.The author must have only skimmed the surface of the organization known as "The OTO," because he makes no differentiation between the legitimate, legally recognized OTO (see book: "The Equinox: The Review of Scientific Illuminism : The Official Organ of the O.T.O. Number 10") and the "Typhonian OTO" of Kenneth Grant. There are several supposed "OTO" organizations, several of which are very misleading.The author of this book attempts to obfuscate the fact that he refers to several "OTO" organizations as one organization; this is absolutely false, therefore he either needs to do much more research or he is deliberately making stuff up.I also found that his usage of the term "Twilight Language" makes no sense, because he obviously has not studied the various aspects of what he attributes this term to; in other words, he attempts to apply the term to several different incompatible scenarios. He stretches shaky concepts and fills empty research with gleaned fodder from conspiracy theories.There is no question that he neglected to properly research the OTO, yet he does mention some interesting people who actually were connected with the legitimate OTO (such as John/Jack Parsons).This entire book can only be taken with a grain of Salt, however it is interesting, and could be a decent book if it were properly researched instead of thrown-together in such a sloppy manner. The photo copies are so blurry that they add nothing of value to the book. Mimeograph copies would be easier to decipher--the pictures mostly look like ink blots.Over all, this is a very poorly written book, minimally researched, and the photos are abysmal; however, those with more knowledge may be interested in acquiring this book as a good laugh, and a collector's item. The author's conclusions and theories are highly dubious, silly in many cases, but entertaining.If you purchase the book as part of a Truth Quest, you will be highly disappointed, because it is mostly bunk; however, if you purchase the book as entertainment, and for the subcultural context, this can be a fun read.The author cannot be taken seriously, yet the book could lead to personal research, by branching off his work, following names and organization names the author uses. The overall impression I had was that the author was trying too hard, and adding too many layers of justification for his theories (because they are weak); the more he adds on to the original premise, the shakier his foundation becomes. More than anything, however, he completely undercuts any validity by blatantly mixing up facts; this can easily be verified by doing a few Internet searches. He simply lumps various groups together as a whole, thus undermining his own attempts to convince the reader. Clearly defined organizations are thrown into a blender by the author, thus resulting in mush and nonsense. Also, a trend that I am seeing in this genre is that authors will make a statement about Charles Manson, then tack-on a completely unconnected statement about the OTO, in order to trick Lazy readers into thinking the two statements are connected. This is an old trick, and follows the tradition of using outdated (proven false) nonsense such as The Leo Taxil Hoax which permeates Anti-Mason and Anti-Occult writings.Much like authors who attempt to use false premises such as the Baphomet Taxil Hoax to promote Anti-Masonry and Anti-Occult rhetoric, this author uses false techniques to attempt to trick the reader into mentally connecting two independent statements about different groups into one visually constructed (misleading and false) statement, through word construction tricks.This is a light read to be taken lightly, and with a grain of Salt.

This book is not as poorly researched as the the book the author quotes ("Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare," by Michael A Hoffman), however many of the same techniques are used to obfuscate facts. Heimbichner throws various Masonic orders, and many different, independent "OTO" orders together into a blender and mixes them up as one supposed OTO which does not exist. In fact, there are several major OTO organizations claiming to be "The OTO"; but only one Legally recognized OTO exists, and the legal OTO has no legitimate connection with the author's statements. However, the author would have us believe that Kenneth Grant is affiliated with the same OTO as Crowley. In fact, I have never found evidence of Grant having any legitimate claim to the OTO, and the courts side with the legally recognized OTO. Motta is of a different Order as well, and he is rejected by legal proceedings in the courts of law. Heimbichner would have us believe that the mish-mash of organizations believed (falsely) to be "the OTO" is a single organization which has supposedly infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church and supposedly controls Freemasonry, though 99.9% of Freemasons believe the OTO is hogwash and that Crowley was an "Irregular Mason" (created by non-legitimate Masons) and Freemasons almost always rebuke Crowley as a Christian would rebuke the devil.Regardless, the following quote from Heimbichner's book is the sort of drivel the author presents as evidence of the OTO being some dastardly spook of an organization that controls everything; Heimbichner states, "It is no accident that lycanthropy is a secret (along with vampirism) belonging to the upper levels of the OTO."If you believe this nonsense, I have some Beach front Real Estate in Arkansas that I need to sell as soon as possible (cash only)!According to the author, the OTO has tremendous influence within the Roman Catholic Church, and all branches of Freemasonry. If this were true, why would this book dissuade Thelemites from pursuing the religion of Thelema rather than heeding the authors silly warnings? If Thelemites honestly believed that they had power over The Church, it seems logical that they would see the writers ramblings as beneficial to their cause. Yet, in REALITY, there are only a few thousand members of the actual OTO in the U.S. (hardly a vast conspiracy), and very few have any connection with Freemasonry.Furthermore, The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements does not mention the OTO or "Thelema"; though it gives Crowley a passing nod as a supposed satanist. I find it difficult to believe that a religious movement which cannot even gain the attention of religious movement researchers has infiltrated the Vatican!This book is silly, and a great lark, but it does have a decent Glossary which could be quite useful. The book is worth purchasing for the Glossary and the laughs, but the research is extremely Sloppy and not worthy taking seriously. It seems this genre of research has about as much credibility the Taxil Hoax. Researchers with knowledge of the subject matter will enjoy this as a collector's item, and as a nice coffee table book; Thelemites might enjoy the Glossary, but Freemasons will roll their eyes and probably throw the book into the pile of other nonsensical rants and ridiculous accusations written by this genre of people capitalizing on conspiracy theories.In summary, the author throws a lot of esoteric concepts and snippets of information, along with many Orders' (organization) names into a blender and gives them a Spin. Hofmans' book as well as this Heimbichner book have underlying Racial Prejudice themes and themes of Anti-Zionist paranoia.Even when some of what they say begins to sound interesting they tack-on nonsensical and unrelated pseudo information and invented statements that are meant to confuse the reader (unless the authors do not realize they are mixing up unrelated information). I say "they" because this genre of authors borrow from one-another to supposedly support their arguments. The effect of this book is basically a long series of mixed up collages and snippets of information, with personal beliefs presented as facts, and highly dubious statements are attached following quoted material. I am assuming the author believes the reader is too lazy or uneducated to catch the visual tricks.This book is silly propaganda, yet I found numerous names worth researching further. This book certainly must be taken with a grain ofSalt, yet a conscientious reader could use this book as a platform in order to pursue individual (ethical) research. This book is not impressive in itself, but the Glossary is useful (a good basis template for research), and the names, orders, book lists, etc. mentioned within the book are worth taking note of. Despite numerous extremely silly notions mentioned in this book I do believe that it is worth a read, and this book is great for collectors. The amusement factor and glossary are worth the purchase price.

Well, the CIA would probably agree with Lesson #9: "In order to do Good, You may have to Engage in Evil".... Seriously, this film makes people evaluate or re-evaluate thoughts about War.This is an interesting documentary, for many reasons. Other people have thoroughly reviewed this, so I am only adding my "two cents." Some folks hate documentaries, but this is worth seeing and purchasing.

I am really enjoying this 2 CD series, from Victoria Wizell's Hyptalk. "Dream Control Techniques Through Hypnosis" is a very useful and helpful program, which has increased my ability to recall Dreams and become Lucid in the Dream state.I have found that this Hypnosis program, by Victoria Wizell, is very effective. She simply eases the Listener into the Dream State, and helps the Listener adjust their habits.I have always been a bit leery of "Hypnosis," so I made-sure to listen to the information in a very Alert state, before relaxing into the sessions. Victoria has a very soothing, friendly, lovely voice. When I did begin fully implementing the program, I felt very comfortable with the techniques and her casual introduction. Soon, I was finally keeping good on my desire to keep a Dream Journal (which I had put-off for a long time, but now write in each morning) and I have been working on each of the projects the "Dream Control" program is designed to teach.I have found this program to be very effective and useful. This is a wonderful tool for those wishing to take more control of their Dream Life. I can honestly say that I have been sleeping much better, since beginning the program, and I get more rest per hour of sleep. My Dreams are much more USEFUL and Controlled, instead of random, and I actually think of jotting-down a few key words to symbolize entire dreams, BEFORE starting the coffee. Then, I can look at a couple of words and write the entire dream(s). I also find myself scribbling a few words, if I awake in the night, and I can recall entire dreams in the morning.Personally, I am very pleased with this program, and I find Victoria Wizell's voice very appealing and relaxing. She speaks very well and everything she says is very clear. She has a lovely voice and a great hypnotherapy program.

Knight and Lomas have done an excellent job, compling information and making their own deductions about the origins of Hiram Abif and Masonic Legend. People who read this book, without having a firm background of Historical Masonic knowledge or a desire to search for the truth, or who take many myths too literally will not unsderstand this book, as I have noticed from the other reviews. Anyone who attempts to judge this book, or any other book, simply because they refer to one particular book (that Masons honor with more respect than many give them credit for) and say they are wrong.... Well, that is not a very intellectual reaction to the material. One should read many books about and by Masons, catalogue the info in the mind, THEN tackle this book--which Knight and Lomas have done such an Excellent job, piecing together! I have been deeply-immersed in Masonic Lore, Bible Study and many other areas of study for the last decade and was always very surprised when Masons sometimes denied the Egypt connection with Masonry...when it was all so very obvious that Egypt holds the secrets of this Honorable tradition. However, at the time, I was reading with an &quot;Outsider's&quot; viewpoint, unclouded by personal involvement, either way. Now, however, after many years of study, I believe Knight and Lomas have finally started putting the last few pieces of the puzzle together. If this book is read with an open mind, without prejudice toward one's own beliefs, you may find some enlightening revelations. If all men would honor each-other's faith, as-do Masons, this world would be a better place to live. The Hiram Key should be read with intellect, not Superstition. The oldest secret societies are products of Egypt, therefor it makes since to make the final connections. Obviously, the source of Info that people want to quote the most is not entirely accurate or untainted by the hand of mankind. Myth is very powerful, but not necessarily accurate. I do know that Knight and Lomas are inspiring and I am delighted to see books such as this one in the public domain!

I absolutely could not put this book down! I'd read Robinson's &quot;Born in Blood&quot; a few times and was craving more.... Then, I found &quot;Dungeon, Fire and Sword&quot; at a local bookstore (before my girlfriend introduced me to Amazon.com). I Devoured the book. I could not stop reading, but I did not want it to end. When I finished the book, I wanted MORE John J. Robinson and--luckily--my girlfriend had purchased &quot;A Pilgrim's Path&quot; for me, via Amazon.com....it came in the mail, as a surprise! I finished that one in two sittings..... John J Robinson is an excellent writer. I admire him, greatly.

I have noted some bad reviews, and few stars but I really liked this film and I am keeping mine. When this first came out, I was very impressed, but even then I thought that some of the CGI was over the top. If you suspend disbelief (and / or have a margarita), the movie is very visually appealing.Kate Beckinsale, alone, gives the movie a high rating, IMHO. There are some aspects of the film which are hokey, silly, or overdone, but overall I liked the movie enough to watch it a few times.I recommend watchingBram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)andUnderworld (Unrated Extended Cut), then watchVan Helsing (Widescreen Edition).

It's no &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,&quot; but this movie is Entertaining and has a bigger budget. It is very, very difficult to buy-into Swayze or Snipes as Transvestites, but Leguziamo comes-across as a fiesty little woman. &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; would-have been more acceptable, if the characters were chosen realistically, instead-of for their Recognition factor.... If real performers in the art would-have been chosen, instead-of Stars-Names, the film would be a classic. However, it flops in comparison with &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.&quot;

My wife and I purchased this Wedding Album, with the entire family (both sides) in mind. We also created a collection of our own Favorites, as well. We used &quot;The Wedding Album&quot; to compensate for our taste in music, and appease the rest of the family. However, we were surprisingly Pleased with &quot;The Wedding Album,&quot; as well--the music is Classic and the quality is great. Everyone at the Reception loved this 2-CD collection of lovely songs. This was a perfect investment, for the Big Day.Considering the fact that our Wedding was scheduled for September 15th, 2001....and considering the circumstances surrounding that time period (9/11), I believe this collection of music saved the day, in regards to the Mood of the Reception.The nostalgic melodies smoothed-over the shattered nerves of most of the attendees. In fact, it was very-much like stepping back in time. The older family members thoroughly enjoyed the music, the younger generations enjoyed the tunes, as well, my Masonic friends enjoyed the music very much--this album worked for all ages / generations.Luckily, we recently had the opportunity to use this album again, for my wife's Brother. Once-again, the album set the mood and did a wonderful job of appeasing all generations. The lucky couple were barely out of high school and they truly enjoyed the music, also.I strongly recommend this album for Weddings. You really can't go wrong with this collection. I am very, very glad I purchased this album for the Wedding, instead of a 1 CD collection--this set gives you adequate time for the Reception--especially, if you think-ahead and bring one or two other albums. My wife and I used this collection plus one 120 minute tape full our favorite songs and &quot;Special&quot; songs.If this collection can keep the mood festive and happy, a few days after 9/11, then it should be able to handle the usual jitters, nervousness &amp; family weirdness that all Weddings inspire.This album paid for itself, twice.

This Diatribe of Freemasonry is much more Humorous, than Kah's attempt at defacing the organization and "revealing" claims about the New World Order. From the beginning, it is very difficult to take the book seriously. The writer sounds like a delusional / paranoid "Conspiracy Theorist" and he takes-up many pages rambling about no one taking him seriously, and lamenting the fact that all the major talk shows dismissed him without response. However, one bright spot in this, is we get to read the Other view of John J. Robinson's famous Interview with the author. If you can get past the whining and "poor me" syndrome, you will find the book becomes quite funny and entertaining. I was giggling, ten minutes into the book. Yet, despite the silly accusations and "out of context" quotations of Freemasonry books, combined with the very narrow-minded views of the author and his constant self-aggrandizement, this book does, in fact have great Value for Freemasons and Anti-Masons.Anti-Masons, with limited perspectives, will love this book and feel vindicated.Freemasons, will enjoy the concise lists of reading materials and the references to obscure Masonic books they may not have heard-of, before. Also, this book is the only book I have read, so-far, that shows the fact that John J. Robinson became a 33rd degree Mason, for his wonderful, well-researched books. I did not learn this, until I started hanging-out at The Shrine....but, here it is, in the Public Domain.Personally, I believe Masons should read as many Anti-Masonic Books, as they read Masonic books. Usually, they are quite silly and good for some great laughs and jokes--however, they also tend to have just-enough information to find a new book or two on the subject. So far, the biggest "conspiracy" I have discovered is the competition to schedule a better fund-raiser than other Lodges: Fish Fry, or Bean Supper..... AHA! Let's have a Chili Cook-off !Masons, give this guy a chance. Even if you can't take him seriously, he is much funnier than Kah and good for many knee-slappers. Besides, this guy has created some pretty good lists of Masonic books, to read-even if he does take things out of context, when quoting.The funny thing is, almost every Mason I know is a devout Christian.

If I were only allowed to recommend One book, Rosslyn would-have been the book I chose to review! I opened it, while contemplating which book I would sit down with, and suddenly realized I'd read twenty pages! This one will be a timeless treasure and a perfect gift for the Mason or Templar-buff...but, you will be pleasantly surprised when you find substantial, historical discussion of Religions, Culture and myth vs. history. Rosslyn will cause many debates and many individual shifts in consciousness. This book is not for the easily-distressed fundamentalist. Of course, if you have not studied about religion, culture, society, et al...you will not understand this masterpiece of truth-seeking research, yet it may inspire you to Delve-Deeper. This work contains a concise chronology of the development of the religion of Christianity, with many references at the back of the book to continue your research, if you are inclined to seek the light. I found the writing style of this book to be very captivating and flowing, unlike some of the less-researched/more-embellished works on the market, which are not so articulately and poetically drafted. This book should be compared with the other important works of the genre, and I suggest looking-into the works of Graham Hancock. &quot;Astrological Lore of All Ages,&quot; by Elbert Benjamine will be handy to have around, while reading this one, as well. Don't pass Rosslyn up...you'll regret it, later.

This is a repost of a review I deleted a few years ago, when I went back to college. Considering all that I have learned in college, I consider this to be a valid Philosophical system, so I am reposting the review:I never thought I would be reviewing a book about a subject that is generally lumped-in with "Satanism," but after many long email conversations with rational individuals, and reading a lot of "Uncle Setnakt's" views and columns online, I decided to give this book a chance. I am actually very impressed with this "Guide to The Left Hand Path." As I read the book, I remember thinking, "What, Satanism with Manners?" Apparently, the Setians figured out some things that a lot of Satanists I have met would be better off to practice, as well. I am starting to think of Setian philosophy as "Common Sensism."

I watched this movie, and had to own it. This movie spoofs many other movies, but not in a blatant manner. The plot lines are solid, and the girls do not bend over backward to make a campy spoof scene. Although the viewer may wish they were bending over backward, the scenes are flowing (as opposed to some campy movies which break stride to make a joke).I really enjoyed the movie, and I know that I will treasure this one in my collection.How can you lose? Arse kicking, hot chics with lesbian overtones and lotsa leg and skirt action. Teenage boys would love this.The movie is well made, and I recall being very impressed. Usually, a hot cover is a coverup for a bad movie, but in this case the cover is truly indicative of the actual film inside the case.

This is an Amazing volume of information, based-upon Anthropological &amp; Jungian interpretations of The Thoth deck. If you love the Thoth Deck or you want to understand the underlying Symbolism of All Tarot cards, this book will be a great asset to your studies and to your collection!I wish I would-have read this book several years ago, when I first acquired it. However, a friend loved it so much that I gave it to her. Luckily, we live-together, now--and she was more than happy to share. Therefore, I had the opportunity to delve into this Fascinating work, researched by someone familiar with cross-cultural and psychological Symbolism.There are so many levels of The Tarot &amp; so much Symbolism, that one can do hundreds of readings and not notice a certain aspect or Symbol of the Tarot Card that is calling-out to you. Yet, this Splendid Handbook will give you absolutely astounding results! If a certain Symbol or Image pops-out at you, more-so than the rest of the card, during one particular reading (or several subsequent readings) this well-written &amp; well-researched Tarot book will help you understand what the Cards are trying to tell you. In my opinion, this Lady knows her stuff !For those who do not understand how Tarot cards work, the System is based-upon Contacting Psychological Symbols and Archetypes in the subconscious mind--as-in Jungian Psychology. The hands simply manipulate the information into revealing itself, through psychokenesis. This means, basically, that your Subconscious Mind is trying to tell your Conscious (Incredulous &lt;g&gt; ) Mind certain information. This is a great way to contact your Inner Emotions and Knowledge learned from the Higher Mind.It is not necessary, however, to study Jungian Psychology and Quantum Physics to understand all this stuff. Just grab a copy of this book and you will be set! You will soon consider this book to be an Invaluable Resource for information and lessons in how to read your Tarot cards. However, do not assume this book is ONLY representative of One deck. Because this Symbolism pervades ALL Cultures, Religions, Myths, etc. it is Infused into MANY Tarot Decks--no-matter who created them, when or where in the world ! There are a few decks out there that are completely Individual works, made by people with personal agendas, or without respect for The Tarot &amp; this book will not help you with those decks--which are mostly just collector's items.For most Standard Decks this &quot;Tarot Handbook&quot; will save you a lot of money and time researching (or scratching your head).I believe that if a person purchases this book &amp; one deck (Thoth, preferably), they will begin to understand The Tarot very quickly. I really cannot say enough good things about this work. &quot;Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot; is a very descriptive and perfect title for this thick handbook, filled with a wealth of Knowledge, drawings and copies of the Thoth tarot cards, for easy reference.I hate to sound cliche' but, she could have just as easily named this &quot;The Only Tarot Book You will Ever Need.&quot;

I bought this on a whim, and it came in a nifty 3-D tin box. I figured, if the documentary wasn't that great the box was pretty cool.This documentary is geared toward debunking (overall), but it should be interesting for those who "Want to Believe," as well. The series begins as a seemingly in favor of (the existence of UFOs) documentary, but my overall impression is that it subconsciously deters folks from believing in extraterrestrials. Regardless, both sides are presented, and you can decide for yourself.I've watched a lot of specials and movies about this subject, and this one is different. It is worth watching (in stages), if you can deal with the repetitive scenes and "look, he is Pondering, deeply...." replays. Personally, I think this is subtle propaganda against believing in E.T.s, but it is still interesting. Always beneficial to look at ALL side of an issue.Then turn the TV off, and go outside. Decide for yourself. But, be careful, since Uncle Sam monitors UFO watchers....for whatever reason. E.T.s or Uncle Sammies, whatever they are this documentary series looks at both sides of the debate and has some information that I have not seen, previously.

I am very impressed with this deck of &quot;Playing Cards&quot; --which can be used as &quot;Tarot&quot; cards and the descriptive book, which explains their meanings. The standard playing card decks used today derived from &quot;The Tarot,&quot; so this deck is charged with centuries of &quot;fortune telling&quot; experience and history.The deck is quite beautiful--with an Antique effect and an obvious &quot;reversal&quot; clarification mark (outline symbol) on each card--with the reversal meaning of each card listed in the book, also. The back of the cards are very pretty, as well.The lovely, well-written book provided with the deck is loaded with information about each card, with great descriptions of each card, full-color illustrations of the cards, instructions for various layouts of the cards and instructions for interpreting the cards.... this is not a typical, tiny little booklet, which usually comes with a deck of Cards--it is a full-sized book (160 pages) and is packed with information!Coincidently, I had just discovered another book which can be used, easily, with this deck, although the book provided with this deck has a lot more information.... however, if you want to start with a very simple, easy to remember format, you can purchase this set and begin with the simple correspondences listed in ISBN # 0312265093 (&quot;Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook: Spells, Curses and Folk Magic for All Your Needs&quot; by Doktor Snake), then work your way up to the full descriptions / correspondences depicted in &quot;The Fortune Teller's Deck: Predict your future with playing cards,&quot; by Jane Lyle.I am very excited about this Book &amp; Card Deck set, because I was looking for a &quot;standard playing deck&quot; to use with Doktor Snake's book, mentioned above....and I happened-across this great Book/Card Deck set--which is much more impressive than most standard decks, artistically / aesthetically.I have been using Tarot cards since 1990 and I have added this book/deck set to my &quot;Favorites.&quot;

If this is the book edited by Louis Fischer, I recommend it for an Uplifting read, that makes you feel better about the insane world we live in. Gandhi was a great man and, fortunately, he wrote his mental processes down for us to read, today. He believed that we should all stop being ignorant towards one-another, over misunderstandings about religion or skin color and work together to form a more harmonious union as the human race. Gandhi was a Humanitarian and read many Holy Books, therefor understood that everyone can worship their God and live their faith, cooperatively with those of other faiths. Gandhi is a must, for all intellectual minds...and should be for those who are still living with propaganda-filled thoughts of hatred towards others, because they are different.

I also read this one in High School.... Didn't we all? Job IS a comedy of justice. I remember reading this one in rapture. The words flowed into my cranium, like soothing balm. I'll never forget the Tent Revival scene....it made all the real tent revivals I went to, as a child, worthwhile. Like all men who &quot;ask too many questions,&quot; The Big Guy puts the smack-down on our man Job...leading to all kinds of weird adventures. Warning: Previous drug users may have falsh-backs, while reading this book, it's a real Trip. Of course, it is very well-written... it's Heinlein! This novel does not probe as deeply into the human condition as &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (Heinlein), but it is a funny journey full of many twists and surprises, with an irreverence that most people could not handle at the time it was written. This book is a perfect gift for your favorite egghead or fantasy buff. Writing about the novel makes me want to read it again!

This is an Enthralling Perspective of the life of Aleister Crowley.... "the rest of the story.""Do What Thou Wilt" fills-in numerous gaps in Crowley's own writings and maintains an open perspective until the last few chapters. This is good balancing material to add to a Crowley research library.Throughout most of the book, the author seems to have an (almost) non-judgmental perspective--giving us a "here's the facts" biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down. It was very nice to read-about all the things Crowley sort-of Glossed-over in his own works. Also, I found it interesting that the author began the book with a list of Crowley's accomplishments that would have been well-recognized, if not for his "Beastly" reputation and eccentric (self-destructive / self-defeating) behavior. The author had access to a wealth of information, including access to individuals in the O.T.O.I felt that the author maintained his mostly non-judgmental view until the last few chapters--when it becomes evident that the author had pretty-much written Crowley off as a "Dirty Old Man"--a sad case of Self-deception and a delusory drug addict.However, unlike most of the biographical material I have read about Crowley, this book tries very hard to show the positive achievements of "The Beast" as well as the more scandalous aspects of the man. Yet, it is very difficult to perceive Crowley in a positive light, when the Misogynistic (wife-beating) scenarios are brought to light--which, if true, obviously makes Crowley a criminal worthy of little respect.Over-all, the book is quite impressive and it seems to give a more-or-less positive outlook on Crowley's life, although it does tend to dispel illusions of Crowley's grandeur and "Prophet" status. However, this book also leaves one with the impression that Crowley did, in fact, follow the "Do What Thou Wilt" philosophy to the utmost.... The man never had to work an honest day's labor, yet always had enough money or duped enough people into taking care of him, and he *Always* had plenty of sex, women, men, etc. to keep himself "happy" in that department.I was a bit disappointed that this author doesn't really cover the Occult aspects of Crowley's life very well....he mostly seems to concentrate on Crowley's disreputable behavior, abusive relationships, and the more Tabloid aspects of his life....and seems to gloss-over the details of the writing of "The Equinox" (a 5 year project, skimmed-over in this biography) --I would have enjoyed a detailed break-down of the formation of that work and the people involved. The author sort-of skips-over Crowley's connections with Blavatsky, with minor references.Although this is an amazing, and well-written, biography of Crowley, one is left with the impression: "So....when did he do Occult stuff ?" (the Occult workings almost seem mere footnotes). This book details his "Book of The Law" workings and the related occult workings, but one gets the impression that the O.T.O. was just something Crowley wrote letters about as an afterthought, occasionally, when he needed money from the members (yet, wouldn't touch L500 of OTO $ under his bed, while lying on the same bed in extremely poor health).As a member of various organizations, I know that it takes a tremendous amount of work to keep any kind of Masonic or Occult group operational....so, it seems a bit odd that this aspect of Crowley's life seems almost like a background story, or basic framework for Crowley's Love Life.A more appropriate title for this book would be: "Do What Thou Wilt: The Life and Loves of Aleister Crowley."Don't get me wrong--I loved this book and learned a lot--but, I feel a large aspect of Crowley's life was given the back shelf to his enormous sex drive. Yet, considering the fact that Crowley and others have covered the "Occult" territory numerous times, this book makes a fine addition to a Crowley collection and fills-in many gaps that Crowley's admirers or apologists would not care to reveal--one would be hard-pressed to portray Crowley as a "Spiritual Leader" if one included the extremely Misogynistic / Abusive behavior (depicted in this book) of Crowley in a biography extolling his virtues as "Prophet of The New Aeon."

Taliesin is an epic adventure in Celtic Mythology, Legend, Oral Tradition and many other areas of interest (Ceridwen, Bardic tradition, etc.). Anyone interested in The Mysteries, History, Celtic Lore, Bardic Legend, Freemasonry &amp; Bardic Legend will find this book extremely interesting. Also, you may want to grab a copy of &quot;The Mabinogi And Other Welsh Tales,&quot; by Patrick K. Ford, to round-out your studies. I am surprised that this book was &quot;out of print&quot; for a while--it is one of my most-treasured books, and certainly a very mystical treatise on the subject. Mystics will truly appreciate this fine work! Luckily, this new edition is available and the Tradition lives on. Anyone interested in Celtic Mythology, Western Mystery schools, Freemasonry, Goddess Worship, Druids, etc. should definitely acquire this book. I have never found a more comprehensive treatise on the subject of Bardic Song, and the secret knowledge perpetuated in Oral Tradition.This book is simply amazing.

This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner. The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these &quot;simple&quot;-looking cards). The images are perfectly acceptable for teaching Children the use of/or stories of The Tarot. In fact, they almost seem to be created with a child-like Happy view of the world, set in fairy-tale history. The Advanced Tarot Reader will not be so impressed with this deck, yet each person must begin somewhere on the Royal Path. Personally, I believe this is a great first stepping-stone on the path of enlightenment. Even thoroughly Indoctrinated Christians will not find too much to worry about in these beautiful cards. This is a great way to start your Mystical Journey!

I have a special place in my heart for this deck, though I have used it seldom since '93 or so. This is the First Tarot Deck I ever owned--purchased on October 13, 1990. I believe this is a great Starter Deck and I always had great success with the readings. One particular reading, that I wrote in my journal, was absolutely astonishing and accurate to the tiniest detail.... I love the great hard-back, beautiful book that comes with the deck (complete with attached ribbon bookmark). At the time, I was not interested in the more popular decks and was drawn to this one.... I believe Women and Artistic-minded people will enjoy and treasure this deck. It is a great introduction to the Tarot, and inspired me to write a Poem.

As a former student of journalism (too many are "falling out of windows"), I enjoyed this movie. The movie is not very fast paced, so younger people might not enjoy it or "get" it. I believe that the film is important for many reasons, and should span the generation gaps, due to current events.This movie has substance, so it is a thinking person's film. Some folks who slept through history class or other classes should give this one a viewing.

Regardless of other reviewers comments about Crowley's mountain-climbing adventures, and other travels, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute detail ! Obviously, his mountain climbing experiences and world travel helped him to develop his "Will," which enabled him to become the most famous Occultist in history. Every time I had a spare moment, I sat down with this "Autohagiography" and poured over the pages until I found myself in a delimma.....only 6 pages until it is finished. More ! More !Two years ago, I would not have imagined I would be reviewing Crowley books. Most of the information about this man seems to have been written by people who took all the myths surrounding Crowley seriously, or preferred to inform the reading public of the Controversial / Tabloid exploits Crowley was *supposedly* involved with. However, despite various Occult Researchers' whimsical attitude toward truth vs. tabloid money-making rumors, this book reveals Crowley as a MAN, not a "Beast."To read the Confessions is to read of a Poetic Young man, who happened to be born into a society Indoctrinated with ridiculous concepts that his level of Intelligence simply could not submit to. The Subversive, Slave-like religion of his birth pushed him to explore other fields of interest and to study Comparative Religion. Reading his autobiography, it is obvious that he was simply too intelligent to be kept down in the mire of "Because."This man thought for himself and lived for himself--despite society's ridiculous posturing and false "morality."Basically, Crowley "tells it like it is," instead of adopting the complacent, indoctrinated attitude of his era and contrymen.There is very little "Occult" information in this book--in fact, he mostly writes about his Mountaineering, Poetry and World Travel throughout most of these "Confessions." The occult-related incidents often seem to be thrown-in as an after-thought, as-if he would much-rather be remembered as a Poet.Personally, I learned quite a lot about Anthropology from this collection of Travels in India, China, South America, etc. It is such a shame that the intellectual level of society (or lack thereof) cannot comprehend Great Men. Crowley was extremely well-educated--therefore, it is unlikely that younger generations will comprehend even a fourth of the material in this autobiography. Well-read individuals will be thrilled to add the Confessions to their library !Don't be frightened by propagandists and money-mongers--this book was written straight from the Horus' mouth and sets the record straight.

This is an amazing piece of Ingenuity! Normally, I would give this deck a slightly lower rating (***), however it receives an extra * for being Easily Transportable &amp; Easily palmed to prevent Zealous eyes from wondering what you are doing. If you live in The Bible Belt, this deck is your best friend! Women find this deck a great asset to keep in their purse &amp; it is Perfect for pocket-carrying by men. The hard, plastic case prevents the deck from being jostled into oblivion &amp; snaps-shut, tightly. This would probably also be a good key-chain item. The first few times I saw this deck, I thought it was &quot;cute&quot; and laughed it off as an &quot;interesting&quot; nick-nack. However, when I finally gave-in to the urge to check it out, I discovered that it is Surprisingly Usable ! I assumed it would be difficult to manipulate and work-with--yet, I was mistaken. It is Easy to use and just as Accurate as any other deck! I honestly believe All Tarot Readers would enjoy this Deck....if for no other reason than the fact that it will probably become a Collector's Item !

Tolkien is a Legend, that thousands of authors have striven to be compared with--yet, none have accomplished the task of out-doing his work. Tolkien is the master and creator of the genre...and the way interest in education is dropping, his position appears to be permanent and unchallengeable. However, many people do not know about this book of translations, by Prof. Tolkien. You can refer to my reviews of the Hobbit and The Trilogy, for more info about his teaching positions and language skills. My copy of this book is yellow, with age, but the book is still as beautiful inside, as it is on the outside. If you love Poetry, or stories of Knights, Romance and Chivalry...or Holy Quests...you'll love this book. If your Tolkien fan does not have this one on the shelf, their collection is incomplete.

Couples and Individuals will love this fast read, jam-packed with useful information about responsible non-monogamous relationships. The sections are clearly defined and illustrated, making this book the perfect primer for the practice of Polyamory.This is a concise and easily referenced collection of modern thought / research on the subject & Practice of responsible non-monogamy, without complicated technical jargon or reference to obscure medical journals.... In other words, it is a great, easy to read book that you can share with your friends, Lover(s) and prospective love interests.For those familiar with the basic concepts of non-monogamy / Polyamory--and the work of Richard Sutphen (Radical Spirituality), Wayne Dyer, etc.--"Polyamory : The New Love Without Limits : Secrets of Sustainable Intimate Relationships,"by Deborah M, Dr. Anapol, will be a perfect addition to your library (if you can get it back from your friends).This book introduces the subject to the beginner with comprehensive, fun and exciting concepts that will peak the interest of nearly anyone.For those who are sick of being bound to ridiculous, antiquated standards of "morality" that lead to Divorce, heartbreak and disputes over children, this book offers a wonderful, Sensible alternative ! However, people with extreme jealous tendencies may not be ready for this New Age philosophy of "Love without Limits" (or, Nearly without limits).These practices Work, in relationships, without question--if all the Love/sexual partners are in agreement. Each type of Multiple relationship is described with detail and diagramed for reference while discussing these issues with your Loved one(s).The Author of this book did a wonderful job collecting information & resources to help those along the path, which are also seeking a more Honest, Sensible, Responsible and Self-fulfilling lifestyle.The flow and ease with-which the author explains these issues (and the occasional cartoons) should help anyone break the ice, if they want to discuss "Opening" their relationship to a higher level of Experience, Love and Trust.

Even if you never intend to read this book, buy it for the Beautiful Symbolism ! This little Book has absolutely Astounding, Full-Color Pictures--many of-which I have never seen, before. The Book is worth owning for the picture of the RC Cross Apron, alone. However, the other Apron Photos are quite Fascinating. The Lodge pictures are beautiful. Anyone with any interest in Freemasonry will treasure this book. The Full-Color photos are amazing. This book was written by a French Mason, so some of the content will be new to others--but, the rest is Universal.

Sure, you can read all the thick Egghead books, if you want, but the average user can simply purchase a copy of this great little book, to learn the basics of the XP Operating System, and use it for reference, occasionally.The Windows XP Operating System is so Wonderful, that a user will not have much trouble, at all. This &quot;Dummies&quot; book should suffice for any questions that arise while using this Fantastic O.S.Do yourself a Favor, and Upgrade from Windows '98 or, preferably, Windows 2000. Install &quot;Microsoft Office XP Professional Upgrade, by Microsoft,&quot; and watch 98% of your computer woes vanish before your eyes ! Do the Updates, and watch the remaining 2% disappear, without a trace.This book is really all the average Home user needs to run with XP. I work in IT, troubleshooting computers, and I strongly recommend this simple reference guide. I am not afraid to admit I was a &quot;Dummy,&quot; in regards to XP.Furthermore, I am using a &quot;Dummies&quot; book to help study for the A+ Exams. These books are fantastic. If you do not have the time to dig-through complicated information to find the answer to a dilemma, use the Index &amp; Glossary to quickly get back to your work. The Screen Shots and Succinct Commentary will have you rolling right along, singing the Praises of XP.

I grew-up reading the Hard-Cover version of this book, which I have inherited from my Grandfather and treasure along-side my Masonic books. There is so much information within the covers of Tompkin's book that is helpful to all students of The Mysteries, that should be read and filed in the mind for later reference. This book is also the first source of information I ever came-across about Akhenaten, the &quot;Rebel&quot; ruler of Egypt. I know that the Hard-Cover edition had many, many illustrations. This book also contains Mathematical break-downs and Geometry involved with The Pyramids, including a well-illustrated explanation of &quot;The Golden Section.&quot;

See Update (*). I installed the software, in Vista, and tried to use it as normal, and by using "Run As XP." Neither option allows me to update the software. I am a certified tech, but I grew tired of attempting to update the software. Reinstallation while online did not help. So far, it seems that the update feature does not work in Vista. The software was dead, in Linux WINE, and would not start (though I can run nearly anything else in WINE).The software looks really cool, but has not been very functional, yet. Maybe it would be ok, in XP, but I was tired of messing with it.However the CABLE recharges the battery, and could easily be used as a handy, easy to pack Battery Charger. Also, surely, photos and such could be accessed through the cable.I would give this product a 3 star rating, but the battery charger capability of the USB cable is very handy.* UPDATE. You can install the software, in XP, and update. After updating, copy the ontents of the Program folder, over the contents on a program foder, in Vista. Then you can update, in Vista, and use all features. Even after Powing the Registry, in Vista, and...tweaking other stuff, this was the only method that worked, for me, to Upgrade Motorola software, in Vista.See my reviews for the related products.....Motorola RAZR V3 Blue Prepaid GoPhone (AT&T;) with $35 Airtime IncludedI also purchased:Premium Leather Pouch with Ratcheting Clip for Motorola RAZR V3

I agree with &quot;blacksun93,&quot; this book seems to be the authors &quot;opinions&quot; of Thelema and I noticed a few sections of the book that could have benefitted from a preface statement, such as &quot;I think that....&quot; or &quot;In my opinion, Thelema....&quot; However, over-all, this is a Great Beginner's Guide to Thelema. It is not as extensive as Lon Duquette's work, but please see &quot;blacksun93's&quot; review, for more info about that aspect of this Primer.Personally, I really enjoyed this Thelemic guide, and the author made a great effort to provide the beginner with all of the basic tools, information, and diagrams to give them a start on the Thelemic path.Also, I believe the author is involved with or Founded the &quot;Thelemic Knights&quot; (motto: &quot;How we get there matters.&quot;)--which I highly respect.I believe the author is making strides in bringing the Positive aspects of Thelema to the public, although Thelema has often been ostracized, due to misconception. Formerly, I had numerous misconceptions about Thelema and Crowley, as well. So, I speak as a formerly misinformed person.I respect the author for presenting this information amd his view of Thelemic Spirituality and Magick.

I found this book to be a very entertaining, carefree and useful guide to Expressing the Feminine Self. Most guys refuse to admit the have a "feminine side," so I respect the author for "coming out" with this truly fun and practical guide for those who feel the need or desire to express their feminine nature--in public, as well as in private.The author explains the intricacies and dilemmas of "crossing" and gives numerous tips for self-confidence, self-improvement, beauty tips, and covers issues relating to stubble; beard growth, et al. These tips could be used by non-cross-dressers, as well. Very few people actually like stubble (about 1% of the people I have met)--especially facial stubble, so the tips in this book can be used even by "macho" guys, to improve their "Cuddle Time."For those with an open mind, this book is very interesting, entertaining and provides numerous website references (copyright 2002, so it is up-to-date) and ideas to try.If you are looking for a book about the psychological implications of this subject, look elsewhere--this author understands that it is "normal" to experiment with gender & sexuality, so there is no need to defend his stance on the issues. The author seems to have a very carefree "take me as I am" point of view.It is very refreshing to read a book about the subject, which doesn't concentrate on Society's negative (uneducated) prejudice against "Alternative" lifestyles.

I was fairly excited about purchasing this last spring, but (although I am a certified tech) I had a lot of trouble with the Operating System. I had to nuke the "restoration partition" to prevent Spyware from reasserting itself and inserting itself. Afterward, the Operating System issues were not too bad, but I could not use the online updating features and HP basically wanted control of my laptop.I eventually nuked the XP Media Center O.S., and installed Ubuntu. That solved the O.S. issues (but Ubuntu requires tech knowledge and books to make hardware usable, especially wireless hardware).All that said, I was reasonably content with the laptop, despite countless hours of reconfiguring the laptop and learning to fully make it "my" laptop. I looked at all of this as a learning experience and dreamed of MACs. However the average person would probably throw it out the window.Personally, I took very good care of mine, as I take care of *all* of my stuff (which I work hard to obtain). Yet, despite my care, a Design Flaw (which HP claims is not a design flaw) caused the screen casing to begin separating at the poorly designed joint. The unit was still within the one year limit at HP, and within the two year limit at Circuit City. No one will fix the problem, though this is definitely a design flaw. As a certified technician, I am astounded that I have been denied service.I made the mistake of purchasing the laptop via Circuit City's website, instead of Amazon.com (my usual and reliable source), so Amazon had nothing to do with that aspect of the problems. However HP poorly designed the product and they do not want to support their product properly.I deleted my online Circuit City account, and I will not purchase via HP in the future, because of my experiences with this laptop.I am a techie, so I can fix my own unit, but I feel sorry for non-techies who purchase this laptop or variations of this laptop.

WarCraft has evolved into an even more user-friendly campaign system, with new races, abilities, options, items, buildings and much, much more! The game comes with a set of flow-charts to help the user remember all the new functions and how the building process works. For the beginner, the diagrams will help determine what you need to advance your race--whether you are playing a Human, Night Elf, Orc or Undead campaign.This new version of WarCraft builds upon the old versions, giving the user more Keyboard commands (and a chart on the back of the player's handbook, for quick reference), Zoom in and out modes, quick movement from one section of the Map, to another, instead of Scrolling across the entire map (!), and many other new features.A well-made "Game Manual" comes with WarCraft III, explaining all the new races, features, etc. The graphics have improved, the game play has improved and the options seem to be endless.You can't go wrong with this version of WarCraft. If you loved II, III will blow your mind. Blizzard is an absolutely Outstanding game company. This is money well-spent!Don't forget, purchasing this game also allows you to play On-line, at Battle.net !

I found this product, and wanted to try it, due to the description. After the product arrived, I was listening to an NPR program which described what is in most Cosmetics (scary stuff). Some cosmetics, such as mascara, have particles of teflon and other fillers which give them a shiny effect, or substance.Especially after learning what is in most cosmetics, I am very interested in this line of mascara!I suggest listening to the NPR special or looking up information, because you will appreciate the concept and ingredients of this product much more if you understand why this product has been developed. Who wants teflon in their eyes?I will thoroughly review this product, after more experimentation.

Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer are inspirational! These great men have combined their thoughts and views about Spirituality and hidden knowledge, backed with decades of research, into a Healing, Informative presentation that will make you understand the quantum mechanics behind our thoughts, bodies and Soul. For those who have never delved into the mysteries, or those who think our lives are not magickal, this series is a revelation! These men are very well-educated and they believe in sharing the methods of Healing that they have discovered....mostly, relating to a person's mind-set and BELIEF in God, self and Healing Power. Doctors of the future may be in for a complete restructuring of their own beliefs, after this work gets-around for a few decades! Be on the ground floor of scientific revolution, check these guys out....and Listen to their ideas. You might just find yourself acquiring more Energy, wealth and Health. I usually would not ever recommend &quot;self-help&quot; tapes, because most of the stuff on the market is goofy or geared towards capitalism and propaganda. However, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer are Genuine individuals, with a strong desire to raise the consciousness of humankind and explore the reality of our Inner Nature. The stories they tell, to help people relate to their ideas, are welcome words for the whole family. Children do not know they are incapable of great things, until they are Programmed to believe this untruth.... Personally, I have always been a &quot;Scurvy Elephant,&quot; myself.

This small collection of Essays and notes from a Rocket Scientist, who mysteriously perished in a lab "accident," while preparing this work, is an astounding and comprehensive dissertation on the Current lack of Freedom; in Thought, Religion, Sexuality and Lifestyle in America.When this material was written, it was not only blasphemous, but dangerous Politically. This man was certainly ahead of his time....a Harbinger of a Thinking Age of Reason and Common Sense.There is more Truth in this thin collection of Essays, than can be found in numerous stacks of books. I highly recommend this work to anyone and everyone. Any person who has ever thought for themselves, should read this book and add it to their philosophical library.Freedom certainly is a "Two Edged Sword," that must be fought with and for, with zeal and courage. Parsons explains, rationally, why the False Morality predominant in America doesn't make a lick of sense and never has. He explains with poetic, scientific Reason, Logic and Mysticism why our society is dysfunctional and self-destructive.This book is also a Wonderful addition to any Feminist's library, or Witch's book shelf. Parsons was obviously well-ahead of his time on issues of Women's Rights, and the Rights of Minorities.It's no wonder he had an "accident" in his laboratory, considering the lack of "Freedom of Speech" in America and the lack of intellectual thought in our country.Basically, this book is a collection of Common sense.... However, he was viewed as a radical, by predominantly Patriarchal Society.If I could, I would give a copy of this book to everyone I met, or communicated with. Parsons was, without question, a Genius and a Martyr for Freedom of Speech, Religion, Sexuality and Common Sense.

I am very impressed with this book. For many years, I had a negative view of "Chaos Magick" and "Chaos Magickians," due to the socially inept freaks I had met that promoted it. However, various stable-minded, rational, intelligent people (who can keep a job and function in society) recently recommended that I look-into "Chaos Magick"--esp., this book by Phil Hine--so, I conceded.Now that I have finally investigated this branch of Magickal studies, I am wondering if it should be called "Common Sense Magick." This is great material, very studiously researched, with references to Psychology, Anthropology and over-all Mental Stability, Self Growth, and Accomplishment in LIFE as well as within Initiatory Circles. Personally, this magickal system fits-in with my perspective of, "Oh, yeah? You are a Great Magickian or Initiatory Mucky-Muck.... Kudos. Can you keep a job and pay your bills ?"I expect this book to scare-away a lot of Freeloaders and pretentious folks. However, for those individuals interested in taking responsibility for their actions and developing as a person, Magickian AND establishing themselves in the Working World, as well as in the Metaphysical world, this book is a great choice.Especially interesting is the fact that this book describes using Computer Programming techniques in Magickal pursuits. This is a very Current work, applicable to the Cyber Age, with new concepts, theories, and exciting possibilities.This book contains an explination of and directions for working with a very interesting Entity, called "Goflowolfog"--a cool cat on a skateboard, who helps with traffic issues. When I first learned of this Entity, I had to purchase the book! this is Magick that uses Common Sense, Humor and techniques I have not encountered in other works. Often, Old School magickal texts can be quite boring, but this is up-to-date information that will intrigue and inspire the reader.

I am a Newbie to Linux. I've used MS products throughout the years, and finally decided to try Linux. From all of the reviews I had read, I chose the &quot;Red Hat Linux 9 Bible,&quot; by Christopher Negus to begin my journey.Luckily, I read-through about one-third of the book before trying the installation. I successfully installed Linux on a Compaq Presario, although the BIOS always over-rides any O.S. disk, other than the restoration disk (98) that came with the system. I compared the Linux Bible information to my MCSE 2000 kit and decided to set-up two FAT 16 partitions, two FAT 32 partitions, and leave the rest of the disk unpartitioned. Note: my first experiment, with only one FAT 16 partition was unsuccessful, and the Boot record was toast. Two FAT 16 partitions allowed me to retain the boot record and dual-boot, properly. The Linux Bible informed me about leaving the rest of the hard drive unpartitioned, in preparation for the Linux installation.Even on the Compaq Presario--with the BIOS over-ride issue--I was able to dual-boot with MS Windows and Linux (although I am a newbie to Linux, and this was my first insatllation of Linux), thanks to The Linux Bible. Now, despite the fact that the BIOS only wants Windows 98, I can successfully boot Linux, 98 &amp; 2000 on the same machine. Most people probably would-have just flashed the Motherboard BIOS, but this was my Mom's PC, at the time I was experimenting. 98 keeps the BIOS happy, and I need the FAT 16 partitions for Linux, so this set-up works well--without flashing the BIOS (and risking damage to the Motherboard).Important note: the Linux Bible taught me to install the Windows Operating systems first, to preserve the Master Boot record--which I did. However, if I made Windows the primary O.S., it dusted Linux. So, I made Linux the Primary boot O.S., and DOS secondary. Now, when I boot, I can choose Linux (or let it automatically load), or choose DOS, then choose between 98 or 2000.Without The Linux Bible I would not have had a clue how to trick the BIOS and install Linux on the Compaq Presario.Also, I found The Linux Bible to be extremely helpful, once the O.S. was installed and I could tear myself away from the Astroids game--which is rather addictive.I strongly suggest The Linux Bible to other Newbies. You can find all of the informmation you need--including the Shell commands. This book seems to be the perfect introduction / Initiation into Linux. I also purchased &quot;Linux in a Nutshell&quot; (O'Reilly), but it seems to be written for people who already know what they are doing and already know how to install Linux.

This book is an astounding collection of Masonic and other Secret Society information. Do not let other reviews deter you from purchasing this tome! I have owned this book for over one year and every time I see something in another Masonic work that I am unsure-of, I can find a reference to the material in Waite's Encyclopaedia. The only reason people think it is too archaic is because people do not read enough. This book is a must-have for any researcher in the field of Masonry and/or other Secret Societies, including the H.B. of L. I appreciate this work, almost daily. If you can't read this one, forget &quot;The History of Freemasonry,&quot; by Albert Mackey. This is a wonderful research book, despite the fact that it needs a thorough index, for quick-reference. I would be willing to Index this work, because of it's value to all Masons and other researchers in the field. I cannot begin to describe how amazed I was, when I cracked the covers of this book for the first time....and the thrill continues, each time I take it off the shelf!

This is one of those rare litle gems that stir the Imagination and make you want to delve into a hypothesis, whether you believe it is true or false. Regardless of the verity of the subject matter of this thin pocket-guide to Adventure in the Languedoc region of France, it does inspire the reader to investigate various interconnecting links and historical works in search of more data to form an opinion about the theories discussed in the heavily illustrated pages. I read the book in '98 and thought it was interesting, but could not quite let myself believe it was accurate. However, after reading a pile of Masonic books and a pile of mass-market stuff--referring to this region--I am convinced there is Something Strange, indeed, about Rennes-le-Chateau and the Languedoc.I almost reviewed this book last year, but I waited until I read a lot of other material, first. I own &quot;Holy Blood: Holy Grail,&quot; but I have not read it, yet &amp; I have not read Henry Lincoln's other works, so most of my interest comes from connections with other historical events and books like &quot;Dungeon, Fire and Sword,&quot; by John J. Robinson.I do believe this book details a very strong case for a Geometrical Conundrum, in this mountain region and the surrounding area, and there seems to be a strong desire to &quot;reveal&quot; the existence of a conspiracy surrounding the region, church, etc. Taken alone and with mass-market material, this book seems to be far-fetched, yet when compared with certain less-known works and the symbolism of Secret Societies....well, it appears to be quite valid--especially, when you consider important admonitions from Masonic Lore, such as: &quot;Alter-not the Ancient Landmarks.&quot;Perhaps, this little book is just a brain teaser, suggesting that people &quot;dig deeper&quot; &amp; decide for themselves what is the Truth?

I love this Rune Stone Set. The Runes are in Red--which is appropriate--and they are easy to work with. The book is a great Reference Guide, for Beginners.I Also suggest : &lt;ASIN: 0877286671&gt;Technically, The Runes should be on Wood blocks or sticks, but this Rune Stone set works very well and is very easy to work-with.I could do without some of the Christian overtones of the Booklet that accompanies the set--because it is out of place, and not important to the subject--but, I think the author was trying to explain that the Runes work well when you are in-tune with Whatever God(dess) that you work with, and that a &quot;Spiritual Path&quot; (of some kind) is conducive and beneficial to tapping-into the Power of The Runes.This is certainly a great starter kit!

Masks of The Illuminati is a fast-paced Adventure and Detective Story, with Albert Einstein &amp; James Joyce playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in the historical setting of The Real World. However, the characters also spend a great deal of time in the Metaphysical world, as well. The average reader will not comprehend half of this book--but, that is the excitement of the adventure! Only the Illuminated truly &quot;get it.&quot; ;)Seriously, Students of &quot;The Mysteries&quot; will have a field day (or an Astral Field Trip) with this thrilling &quot;fictional&quot; novel.Robert Anton Wilson must be a genius to have incorporated so much historical and metaphysical Truth, into this &quot;story&quot; of a young, wealthy, well-educated Englishman being Initiated into a branch of The Golden Dawn, while trying to investigate a series of strange &quot;occult&quot; attacks in Scotland, against a Presbyterian minister....fighting both the forces of Darkness and his own repressed sexual tendencies, simultaneously !This is a fascinating journey into the world of occult organizations and Initiation, climaxing in a most unusual and exciting manner....leading the reader to strongly desire clapping Aleister Crowley on the back while saying, &quot;Well-done, 'ol chap!&quot;I strongly doubt that non-occultists will understand this great novel--but, the Story holds it's own and being a student of The Mysteries is not a Prerequisite. For those in the dark, a quick online search can fill in the gaps, as you read.This book is more fast-paced than Focault's Pendulumn and the scenes with Einstein &amp; Joyce as Sleuths are very well-constructed. You will feel that you are in the room with them...listening attentively and anxiously awaiting the Conclusion !

I have been hearing about this, since I was a child ! This book should be subtitled "The Birds & The Bees"-well, mostly, it's about the Birds. This book details the Soap Opera lifestyle of Birds, from a Humorous, Scientific point of view, but strives to inform the reader about "The Myth of Monogamy," without inundating us with complicated scientific Jargon.The Myth of human Monogamy is explained, by first back-tracking and giving examples from the animal kingdom, proving that the former scientific beliefs of Monogamous animal behavior was based more upon Human Indoctrinization, than actual fact-unscientific views and Clouded Perception, filtered through the lens of religious / social beliefs. This book sets the record straight and proves, through the tremendous efforts of scientists of the present era, that Monogamy is almost entirely a Myth in the various Animal as well as Human species.Most people of Jealous inclination will probably hate this book, because it explains the common sense Reality of human interaction, and denounces the silly Myths and social lies we have been indoctrinated with since birth, by society and religion. After reading this book, there can really be no doubt that Humans are NOT Monogamous creatures.Your parents always told you about the Birds and the Bees.... Well, according to the Birds (and complicated, Scientific DNA research in that field), they say "it's ok to be non-monogamous (even if you must Pretend to be monogamous)."Open-minded individuals will love this well-written, accessible research and explanation of human and animal sexual patterns. However, if you are looking for the Spiritual or personal aspects of Non-Monogamy and how this lifestyle affects individuals, families and relationships on a more Personal level, please see my Listmania list on the subject of "Polyamory."

This Novel is a Journey through realization of what can happen when one Religious Power gains control of all-other religions and people, in this Technological Age. This is a Revelation of what our world could become, if Zealous "religious" people are in-control.All those of "Alternative" faiths will enjoy this book & those of Dominant (Dominating) Faith's will despise this book. The Fifth Sacred Thing is definately a sacred book in the Pagan community. I honestly believe everyone should read this wonderful tale of the possible future.For all those of Alternative Faith, this is a treasured story.For all those of Zealous Adherence to Dogma, this book will be a burden and a curse to their thinking process and their plans of global domination.The "Millennialists" are representative of a Religio-Political Force, dominating and subverting everything Pure: Earth, Fire, Air, Water & Spirit..... Stripping Humans of all the basic rights of life and forcing their views on the world, in a Nazi-like system of Control. However, a small community remains, removed from the destructive system of Corruption--separated by harsh lands and broken roads....and decades of Fear.This wonderful Novel depicts the very believable scenario of a New Inquisition, in-which everyone must agree to the corrupt State Religion, or suffer and lose thier names, titles, professions and the right to have Water.I highly recommend this book to all Thinking Individuals--depsite their religious preference. Starhawk has given the world a new Vision of the way things CAN be..... This is not a "Tree-Hugging Hippy" book. The characters are very well-written and you will grow to cherish them and hope the best for them, throughout their Journey. I felt for these characters more-so than any others I have read-about for many, many years.The first ten pages gets off to a rough start, then the book smooths-out and becomes an engrossing tale that makes it very difficult to put the book down. Now, I want to know what happens to the characters and the World, AFTER the "Fifth Sacred Thing !"

I watched this last night, and found the entire film/documentary to be very fascinating, fun, enjoyable, exciting, Revealing, and Inspiring!I was not sure what to expect, because I am accustomed to seeing professional shows at local clubs. However the film truly represents a diverse range of Transgendered women vying for recognition of their beauty. Aside from the contest and the documentary style interviews with contenders for the crown, honest discussions about lifestyle choices, gender identity, and family relationships are explored. For anyone who lives a bit outside the "norm" of societal standards, or for those who consider their lifestyle to be "Alternative" in some fashion this DVD is a great resource for confirmation, inspiration, and background information about *why* people choose to live outside the bounds of strictly dictated rules and regs about who we are supposed to be.Personally, I identified with many of the individual women interviewed in the film, and I found myself smiling throughout much of the film. Some stories also contain obstacles and societal situations which are quite serious, but overall the film is fun, uplifting, and exciting.One transgendered woman was genuinely upset that others were acting overly naughty, exposing themselves without cause, and generally acting trampy. Her sincerity flows from the screen. A few acted like drag queens, but many were quite serious and sincere. Most of the women are beautiful. Watching the film, and viewing the actual event (beauty contest) was a fun experience plus the backstage scenarios were entertaining and informative.I was totally invested in the interviews (not boring documentary style, but well produced and captivating), until the end when one obese tranny that I had previously respected began to claim "racism" as the factor in her defeat. Obviously, obesity was the key factor in her defeat, so the racism issue was invalid. I felt that she discredited her previous sincerity when she blamed her loss on racial issues, rather than accepting the fact that she she is very overweight. Despite a few catty remarks at the end, the film is sincere, and well worth watching. One contender who I assumed would take a top three position only made it into the final round, so there are some surprises in the contest results.I assume that others (from other Alternative lifestyles) would find this film inspirational, because the contestants are living out their dreams instead of playing out the societal and familial demands which most people are not capable of breaking away from. Yet I also assume that anyone interested in sociology, psychology, or subcultures would also enjoy this film. I cannot think ofTrantasiaas a "documentary," because it is not boring and the style and film quality are fantastic. In fact, the stage show is glamorous, and the bodies are beautiful.If this doesn't grab you, I'll also mention that there are many revealed and mostly revealed breasts, lots of skin, and sexy outfits. Many of the women are all about beauty, and their bodies reveal their dedication to being women. A few of the women are obese, but they take the time to explain to those who are hefty how they can modify their body shapes with corsets, clothing, etc., in order to be more feminine. Therefore this film has something for nearly everyone; whether gay, straight, bi-, male, female, transsexual, fat or thin...this film truly speaks to nearly everyone.I believe that this is a perfect film/documentary for people from all walks of life (Alternative or "vanilla") to understand and appreciate those who live outside the bounds of supposed "normality" and ASSIGNED gender roles.Inspired by this film, I will soon be reviewing the following books and DVDs, as well, plus other purchases I have made;Miss Continental Pageant,El Calentito,Transamerica (Widescreen Edition),True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism--For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals,The Transgender Companion (Male to Female): The Complete Guide to Becoming the Woman you Want to Be, andThe Praeger Handbook of Transsexuality: Changing Gender to Match Mindset (Sex, Love, and Psychology).

StarCraft is an Exciting, Stress-relieving Strategy Game--with Online, Multi-player options. This is not your typical "hack n slash" video game. Players must use Strategy, building skills / building repair, Upgrades, fast-paced fortification and building of a base.... relocation of "buildings," by flying them to new Energy Sources...and patience. Oh, and did I mention fending-off Nasty, Acid-Spitting, Demonic-looking Aliens, while you are *attempting* to build your fortifications ?Ready to Squash some "Bugs ?" IM your friends and go-online, with Battle.net (or, just meet people online, via Battle.net)--the Multiplayer option allows your friends to join you against the Computer, or each-other. This is Great stress relief, for after work & chores.This game is rated for "Teens," but nearly all the adults I know own a copy --plus, the "StarCraft: Brood War" expansion pack (which I just installed, and recommend ! ).If the product is from "Blizzard," it's all good !!!For the price, you simply cannot go wrong. If you love Strategy Games and you love blowing stuff up, StarCraft will become your new addiction.

I just installed the "Brood War" expansion pack, and all I can say is "Oh, yeah.....bring it on." Brood War gives the StarCraft player(s) More Options, The Zerg (enemies) are even MORE Powerful &lt; yikes ! > & the Terrans have Medics to help you survive....for a while. All the Upgrades are available on Battle.net, as well (user must D/L the Battle.net Upgrade, after installing the expansion pack, again). At start-up, the Player must choose between the original Starcraft, or the Brood War version.StarCraft is an Exciting, Stress-relieving Strategy Game--with Online, Multi-player options.
