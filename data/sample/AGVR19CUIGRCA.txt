The first twelve numbers recorded in 1952 will offend those anti-mono listeners who can not support the noise very audible.But don't forget that the liner notes have told you so.The second set recorded in 1959,is worth the price alone of this cd.What i mean is that when you have OSCAR PETERSON at his peak playing the music of DUKE ELLINGTON,it's simply for any jazz fans,the quickest way to get to heaven.OSCAR knows his craft;he can get around those tunes anytime and always find new settings for you to rediscover them.In fact he did,because he recorded ELLINGTON tunes again after that.On these recordings,he has mostly stayed with the tunes and did not go for the adventurous ways.Let's not forget that NORMAN GRANZ,the original producer of this series of songbooks devoted to the composers wanted these to appeal to the mainstream crowd.Mission accomplie.

THE SEARCHERS were one of five groups stamped as MERSEY BEAT groups during the BRITISH INVASION.Apart from THE BEATLES,easily the best group of the bunch,there were THE DAVE CLARK FIVE,GERRY AND THE PACEMAKERS,HERMAN'S HERMITS and THE SEARCHERS.All of those bands were essentially singles oriented.Notice how WHEN YOU WALK IN TO THE ROOM sounds like THE BEATLES I FEEL FINE.Still,some of their singles,all included here are part of the so called 1963-1966 era,and have that innocence that after 1967 will be lost forever.SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA LOVE AGAIN and EVERYBODY COME CLAP YOUR HANDS were probably their two best tunes.When THE SEARCHERS released SECONDHAND DEALER in 1967,the clean cut image went downhill, and JOHN WAYNE took his STETSON and shoot them all out,regaining the title of his most famous western.

Since the word m&eacute;lodrama has vanished of our vocabulary,it is not easy today to appreciate BERTHE SYLVA,the singing queen of the genre in FRANCE.This collection does not include all her hits:FROU FROU and DU GRIS and a few others are not in the selection.LES ROSES BLANCHES was voted years ago in a survey as FRANCE's all time favorite song.ON N'A PAS TOUS LES JOURS VINGT-ANS is also a famous song that our grandmothers used to sing.It is interesting to notice that the melody of LE TANGO DES FAUVETTES was also used for a MISTINGUETT song:DANS LES BOUGES LA NUIT.This may not figure among your desert island discs,but for it's price,it's worth it.

DAMIA had a long career(1911-1956),with the theatrical antics always on top of her voice.She also started with ROBERTY who was at the time FREHEL's husband.Her style is more inclined toward the dramatic,although she tried to live it up a little once in a while.Her live persona influenced PIAF and JULIETTE GR&Eacute;CO among others.This is a worthwhile collection of her material.EN MAISON and LES DEUX M&Eacute;NESTRIERS who demonstrates accurately the two sides of her are missing.LES GO&Eacute;LANDS written by LUCIEN BOYER is unmistinkly hers;the same thing can be said about LE GRAND FRIS&Eacute;,LA CHAINE and JOHNNY PALMER.I have special affection for LE GUINGETTE A FERM&Eacute; SES VOLETS and C'EST DANS UN CABOULOT,both charming.Undoubtely,there is a DAMIA style,not as strong as FREHEL,but nevertheless there.She is often considered the prelude to PIAF.

Volume 2 of the complete COLE PORTER songbooks on VERVE is a clinger all the way.Songs like EVERYTHING I LOVE,GIVE HIM THE OOH-LA-LA and MOST GENTLEMEN DON'T LIKE LOVE are not often recorded.ANITA gives us a typical treatment of MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY which means her way;The ELLA renditions are not from the songbooks of 1956;i personnaly enjoy AFTER YOU,WHO from the magical voice of HELEN MERRILL and SO IN LOVE done in cha-cha by that maneater par excellence DINAH WASHINGTON.This is an excellent tibute to COLE PORTER,well worth buying.

Rousing fight scenes(watch out for those tigers);the story well let's say that it is adequate for this kind of epic movie.RUSSELL CROWE is ideally cast,what else can i guy want?Maybe a virtual collesium can convince you that this is actually ROME.I had a hard time to convince myself that JULIUS CAESAR was actually this guy who plays him.Somehow whenever JULIUS is on the scene,i was inclined to laugh.Remember the old saying:they don't make them like they used to do.Well, sometimes they do, but curiously we discover that we didn't missed them that much.If you invite your new girlfriend to watch this,i'm sorry for you, but you may not here from her again.

Also available in a collection that adds 8 songs that were in HELEN's third album DREAM OF YOU(try to get that one if you can),this is an essential jazz singing record.I always refered to HELEN as the ever sweet caressing voice.An ideal choice for nightcap listening, which profits from CLIFFORD BROWN's wonderful blowing.When CLIFFORD died at age 26,he was becomming a star trumpetter just like DIZZY and MILES.He had made his mark with SONNY ROLLINS and SARAH VAUGHAN.HELEN MERRILL is a ballader of a superior kind.It's nearly impossible to find better renditions of the first five songs included here.Get that cd fast before AMAZON get out of stock.

Third adventure of DOINEL,TRUFFAUT's semi-autobiographical character after THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS and ANTOINE AND COLETTE(not a full film).ANTOINE now a young man discovers love in the presence of a mature woman(DELPHINE SEYRIG)and then with a girl of his age(CLAUDE JADE).Not one of the director's best movie,it contains nevertheless many priceless moments like the scene that has ANTOINE testing his image in a mirror and saying the name FABIENNE TABARD(mesure your degree of tolerance with that scene)The film makes good use of CHARLES TRENET's song QUE RESTE-T-IL DE NOS AMOURS?The charms of many vignettes actually surpasses the coherence of the whole.Fans of the director have head start here.

It starts very well with four songs forever associated with him.YVES MONTAND was always the most AMERICAN inclined FRENCH artist of his generation;he fashioned his persona after his boyhood idol FRED ASTAIRE.Then the collection mixes the good and the not so good(perhaps with the intention of a volume 2).All the fans of MONTAND know that DANS LES PLAINES DU FAR WEST(his first song),C'EST SI BON(made famous by LOUIS ARMSTRONG),LES FEUILLES MORTES(in it's original version) and BATTLING JOE belong in a greatest hit collection among a few others.As we often say, we can't have everything, even if we could if music was not primarly an industry.

The chemistry between ELLA and LOUIS was great.It was not evident to do PORGY and BESS with them,but it works splendidly.There is a minor setback for me:ELLA can't do MY MAN's GONE NOW the way SARAH VAUGHAN used to sing it,but the rest of the disc is so enjoyable that one can easily pass that over.I am happy that NORMAN GRANZ the producer succeeded in convincing LOUIS to tackle that project.It is really moving to hear him sing and play his instrument on those tracks,especially I GOT PLENTY OF NOTHIN' and THERE'S A BOAT LEAVING SOON FOR NEW YORK.If you have to choose among the many recordings of PORGY and BESS available,you have to go for that one,even if of course,this is not the complete work.

About halfway mark,like most HENRY JAMES novels,the story gets a little obvious to be entirely convincing,but along the way here's your chance to enjoy a decent story which profits from a good casting.Saying that HELENA BONHAM-CARTER is ideal in this type of role has become a clich&eacute;,but it is so true.Cynic guys who want to watch this to see HELENA naked be patient,you'll get satisfaction near the end.The conclusion has the guy returning to VENISE,which means he won't marry KATE.Between you and me,how can a normal man refuse to marry a georgeous woman like BONHAM-CARTER?After watching this movie, i dreamed that HELENA was my sister and she was conforting me in the morning.Unfortunately,it was only a dream.

Often considered the GONE WITH THE WIND of the poor,this civil war story has it's moments ,but is really uneven.SUSANNAGH (LIZ'S character)is overblown and it slows the action a bit.CLIFT has the kind of stubborn role he often had in his career;EVA MARIE SAINT and LEE MARVIN in a supporting role are convincing.While not a must see movie,it is a real curiosity that won't waist your precious time.You better see this one on your nearest video location store.Don't make the mistake of buying it

While they wrote many greats songs together(THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC,BLUES IN THE NIGHT),HAROLD ARLEN and JOHNNY MERCER were never really BROADWAY bound.However, this show had all kinds of misfortunes in 1946 and really deserved the second chance it got in 1998.Of course the original orchestrations were not quite the same as they are here,but the fact that the show could have a rebirth is in itself a reward that can not be denied.VANESSA WILLIAMS is wonderful.The show has one character miscast;it's easy to find out if you listen to the cd at least twice.Try to indentify it because i won't tell you.Overall, this revival is perhaps not perfect, but was certainly worth doing.

The two records that made ELTON JOHN an international pop star still delivers after all those years.What amazes me here is the variety of songs in styles that ELTON is able to maintain.It is a perfect showcase for his talents as composer.It starts with a progressive song complete with an overture(FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND),and along the way ballads are featured(CANDLE IN THE WIND,GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD)country delights(SWEET PAINTED LADY,ROY ROGERS),reggae(JAMAICA JERK-OFF),and rockers(SATURDAY NIGHTS ALL RIGHT FOR FIGHTING),and even a cute dummy tune(BENNY AND THE JETS).There is absolutely no fillers here.This is a perfect offering;a great double set like very few.Double albums of the time were often disapointing, because they were overstretching a lot.Everybody will find songs that they enjoyed here.A must

Now people read this, JOHNNY MERCER was probably AMERICA's most prolific songwriter.From 1930 to 1976 JOHNNY wrote more than 1,000 songs.He also sang with his good natured SOUTHERN accent and co-founded CAPITOL records.Still, many people don't know him apart from singers who sang his songs.You might not know it but you certainly have heard many of his songs : THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC,I'M AN OLD COWHAND FROM THE RIO GRANDE,MOONRIVER are only a few of them not present here.ELLA and conductor NELSON RIDDLE have chosen true swinging greats TOO MARVELOUS FOR WORDS,SOMETHING'S GOTTA LIVE but also some songs not often recorded like SINGLE-O and MIDNIGHT SUN.ELLA has recorded other MERCER songs in the HAROLD ARLEN SONGBOOKS

Well let's be realistic this musical comedy is the least interesting of all the adaptations of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN's classic shows.The fact that JOSHUA LOGAN had directed the original show makes you wonder if the guy knew how great the show was in 1949.If you remember, SOUTH PACIFIC had great singers to sing the songs.Where are the singers in the movie?What's the use of making a movie musical if anyone but one character gets dubbed;a complete aberration?RAY WALSTON fortunally manages to get you a few laughs as LUTHER.I suppose the film can be tolerable if you've never seen the musical on stage.It would be a great mistake to judge this wonderful show only by this movie.Young folks be warned and please buy the original cast album with MARY MARTIN and ENZIO PENZA

If you are allergic to boxes(although the COLUMBIA YEARS is excellent),there are 4 cds that represent the equivalent to that collection:SINATRA SINGS HIS GREATESTS HITS,LOVE SONGS,SINATRA SINGS RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN and SWING AND DANCE WITH FRANK SINATRA that has the distinction of being an original(the last 8 selections)with alternatives versions of some of his most fondly remembered songs of that time.While THE HUCKLEBUCK ,THE CONTINENTAL and MEET ME AT THE COPA are destined to make you smile the rest of the week,this collection is essential to FRANK SINATRA fans.Why you may ask?Because simply ,this can be considered as his first real LP and the prelude to what the future was aiming at for the famous guy of HOBOKEN,NEW JERSEY.Four years after this,THE VOICE will be back and by signing with CAPITOL reconquer his crown in the greatest comeback in the history of AMERICAN popular music.

You will either come out of this book saying that man is a sex maniac,or you will say to yourself at least he is honest.Whatever option you may choose,the facts remain the same,CHUCK BERRY more than anybody else is the one who helped shaped rock music the way we came to understand it.After all,what is rock but sex put to music.You may beleive that my definition is simplistic,but if you think about it,it is not far from the truth.Still parts of this book(and i do not consider myself a puritan)shocked me,and i am sure some of you will feel the same.Do we really need to know about his sexual prowess that unfortunately proves that the man has an ego bigger than CASANOVA?I still like CHUCK BERRY's music a lot,but CHUCK BERRY the man is a big disapointment.He at least recognizes that MUDDY WATERS is responsible for his recording career at CHESS records ,and that LOUIS JOURDAN was his favorite singer.To resume,i must say that if you choose not to read this book,i won't blame you.There are better autobiographies on the market.

While not alltogether satisfying as a whole,PAPILLON is still well worth seeing.The film has long stretches without dialogues that can annoy you considering the running time of the movie.Parts of the script are not clear;the best example being the use of flashbacks.McQUEEN and HOFFMAN are well casted.Still ,something is missing to make it great and unique.To excuse the scriptwriters,i shall say that the book was not easy to adapt to the screen.Since it was a true story,it can't be can like a novel.Watch out for that scene in the leperous colony.Favorite moment:PAPILLON and his friend being fooled by a guy who promised them a boat for their money.

To maintain interest for 112 minutes in a movie that has one set,you've got to have a good script,and JOHN MICHAEL HAYE's for this film is almost perfect.HITCHCOCK is clearly at his peak here,working with a crew that understands his vision.The casting is examplary in every aspect;GRACE KELLY shines with her feminine charm;THELMA RITTER was one of the best supporting actress of her time and JAMES STEWART was tailor made for his role.A suspense film like this was quite unusual in 1954.What makes HITCHCOCK such a great director is his attention for details:the ring in GRACE's hand near the end;the way that HITCHCOCK combines the appetites of sex prelude and murder without insisting too much but making his point.If you pay attention,this film actually has a lot to say about the human nature.You should watch this movie twice to fully appreciate it.Many youngsters, brainwashed by the thrillers of our time ,that manages a few killings every fifteen minutes will be bored by this film.It is in fact stylish and intelligently conceived.One of HITCHCOCK'S 10 best ever.

The first 8 numbers were actually ELLA 's first LP.At the time for those old enough to remember LP's were shorter,it's going to change in 1955.That album was actually a prelude to ELLA's massive GERSHWIN songbook of 1959.You always can tell if a singer is good if he is only back up by a pianist,such is the case here and ELLA was indeed a wonderful singer capable of putting her voice againt all sorts of arrangments.The other songs were in a 1954 lp and what a great choice of material that was:2 early SAMMY CAHN songs;superb versions of STARDUST and MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY who are alone worth the price of this cd of great interest to all ELLA FITZGERALD fans.From now on, NORMAN GRANZ will take the singer's interests ,even if a contract was never signed between them, which proves how one respected the other.If you should buy only one ELLA not in the songbook collection,this is the one.

Let me try to be objective here;this was STEVIE's third masterpiece in a row;a great collection of soul,funk and ballads concocted by a master chef.Just remember,1974 was the year disco music really became popular,and this guy was reinventing the dictionnary of soul music.If an artist has deserved every GRAMMY award he ever earned,it is STEVIE WONDER.Few artists have dominated a decade like he did in the seventies;his influence is still being felt today.Everything in that album is of interest,from the funk groove of BOOGIE ON REGGAE WOMAN and the political YOU HAVEN'T DONE NOTHING aimed at NIXON's administration,to wonderful ballads like HEAVEN IS 10 ZILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY and THEY WON'T GO WHEN I GO.Bying only a greatest hits package is an outrage to this artist.Buy TALKING BOOK,INNERVISIONS,SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE and HOTTER THAN JULY and you'll find out why STEVIE matters.AMAZON is waiting to send them to you.What are you waiting for?

I can't thank enough all the people responsable for this terrific revival cast album.Here is a perfect example of how you should do a classic show and maintain the original intentions of the writer and the composer.If they were alive,JEROME KERN and OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN would have been proud of the way their masterpiece have survived them.It is impossible to imagine a better version of the show;this is the definitive one.It's funny when you think of it,most people know the songs by heart,yet it seems that we rediscover the show with this version.Suddently ,we are in 1927 and mister ZIEGFELD is scared like hell that he will loose a lot of money with this;but that's strangely the situation in which the modern AMERICAN musical was born.

Arguably the director's best movie,LES DEUX ANGLAISES ET LE CONTINENT is both charming and moving.TRUFFAUT always loved stories about love triangles(his own life was like that).It is not surprizing that he added the scenes that were originally missing when the film was first presented in 1971.He was obviously very fond of that movie.JEAN-PIERRE L&Eacute;AUD his alter ego from the DOINEL series was miscast to be sure,but it doesn't diminish the quality of the storytelling.A common TRUFFAUT device here is the use of the voice over that comes off perfectly.Very few films have succeeded in presenting the theme of love in all it's cruelty and physical aspects.MURIEL and ANNE the h&eacute;roines are reminiscent of the BRONT&Eacute; sisters.A good choice for anyone who wants to understand the psychology of women.

Way before IRON MAIDEN,DEF LEPPARD and VAN HALEN,there was BLACK SABBATH,the group that really created the genre.Songs like the title track,SABBRA CADABRA and KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE remain timeless.We've got to credit the group for trying to get a little fancy with the instrumental FLUFF.The rest of the stuff simply does not work at all.However,there are a prelude to the next lp who will fulfill the ingredients missing here.Don't you think that the sleeve look a lot like many IRON MAIDEN discs?You can resume BLACK SABBATH well with WE SOLD OUR SOUL... or PAST LIVES,but as the man say it's fun to have originals instead of those endless repackaging that make the industry roll.Just start with SABOTAGE.

A better collection than the ANTHOLOGY ,because there are less songs and they are the best that SYLVIE recorded for RCA.Americans will recognize many songs like DA DOO RUN RUN(THE CRYSTALS),BAD BAD LEROY BROWN(JIM CROCE)and TURN,TURN,TURN(THE BYRDS)SYLVIE'S best original hits are also present(LA PLUS BELLE POUR ALLER DANSER,COMME UN GARCON,LA MARITZA being the most famous)So this is a good buy for any SYLVIE VARTAN fans who wants like the title says the essential.Of all her generation,SYLVIE has always been the most AMERICAN oriented pop singer.In her case,this is not pejorative at all,since she has proven herself to be an excellent showgirl.

It is estimed that PIERRE MacORLAN wrote 60 songs;he started writing them at age 67 which is rather unusual.He had of course an interesting past as a writer of fiction before he turned to songs.When he was asked about the inspiration for his songs he said that they were mainly about his turbulent and adventurous younger days spend in cabarets of MONTMARTRE like LE LAPIN A GILL.This cd if it wasn't for the first five numbers(mainly leftovers recorded in 1989)would have been almost as priceless as CHANSONS DU QUAI DES BRUMES.As it is, it is still worth buying because of the set recorded in the sixties 8 to 17.FANNY is often considered to be his best number and LE PROGRES D'UNE GARCE is quite funny.Those who like MacORLAN must also check out the 1964 JULIETTE GRECO chante MacORLAN,only 32 minutes but very good.

This film i beleive should be seen by all men who grew up without sisters;it would help them understand their nature.It's funny how such a story like this can succeed in making a wonderful movie,at times bold and romantic.Strangely,none of the songs written by MERCER and DEPAUL became standards of the repertoire,but god knows how many great songs mister MERCER wrote.HOWARD KEEL made many musicals(ANNIE GET YOUR GUN,KISS ME KATE,SHOWBOAT),and as we say,he had a heck of a voice.The fight scenes will please the men,and the courtship will delight the ladies.In the end,everybody ends up happy.

Only die hard fans of GERSHWIN should buy the massive songbook ELLA AND NELSON RIDDLE made in 1959 ,because the great songs are all included here.Back in those days ,GERSHWIN was still considered the best AMERICAN composer, probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded ,and also because of the fact that he died young.Nowadays we know that RICHARD RODGERS and JOHNNY MERCER are the deserving legends of AMERICAN popular music.Having said that let me say that this collection is perfect,it's really the best.Personal favorites of mine are SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME and BUT NOT FOR ME.Even the guy from TEXAS should enjoy that one.

Fine selection of material from the songbooks recorded by PETERSON during the fifties.Two versions of BLUE MOON,you may ask why they included both?The approach differ completely and are fascinating to compare.OSCAR seems to have had lots of fun with the VINCENT YOUMANS songs:TEA FOR TWO,I WANT TO BE HAPPY and WITHOUT A LOVE.On these particular tunes,he went the adventurous way.This is perfect to listen to after a hard day at work,when no one wants to talk at supper time.So far,four originals among these records have appeared on the cd market;they have assembled the DUKE ELLINGTON songbooks into one cd(2 on 1)and they did the same with ARLEN,GERSHWIN and PORTER.The others will hopefully follow.If you may let me give you an advice,i'll tell you this:by listening to those two cds,learn your favorites and then buy the cds of the composers you like best.

Volume 1 of the complete COLE PORTER songbooks on VERVE starts with DINAH's live voodoo version of I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN(you should rave over this one);then LOUIS gives us LET'S DO IT,the song that made PORTER famous in 1929(BING and RUDY VALEE recorded their versions the same year).SATCHMO sings the complete lyrics of the song,a rare thing.ANYTHING GOES is from ELLA's songbook of 1956;SARAH also sings the complete verses of IT'S DE-LOVELY.In general,this is an another good tribute to PORTER with only two turns off:WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE and EV'RY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE.2 over a 17 songs selection,don't do the fine bouche,buy it.Try to buy volume 1 and 2 individually,so you can avoid the uneven instrumental disc offer in THE COMPLETE COLE PORTER SONGBOOKS BOX.

If you don't know other songbooks from the ELLA's 16 collection,you might enjoy those two cds a lot.But many of those excellent songs have been covered so well by the likes of SINATRA,GARLAND etc.that you are bound to be disapointed.ELLA is not at ease with with BILLY MAY's driving orchestral direction.Compare MAY's wonderful work with ANITA O'DAY(SWINGS COLE PORTER)to experience the difference.It's simply a mismatch.However,if you don't pay attention to these sorts of details,you can buy it eyes closed,because no songbook of ELLA is without interest.THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC and BLUES IN THE NIGHT were allready famous songs at that time;GET HAPPY will forever be associated with JUDY GARLAND.My favorite here is MY SHINING HOUR.A medium FITZGERALD can still be a crowd pleaser.

Recording a tribute album to the memory of a famous composer is not as easy as one would think.There are many of those on the market,but very few have the quality of those recorded by OSCAR PETERSON.Why you may ask?Mister PETERSON has lived with those songs all his life;he knows how to read them on his keyboard and it shows.Those two tributes albums reunited on 1 cd are ideal for nightcap listening.The sound quality of the early selection being in mono is not first rate,but it's just as enjoyable.Chronogically,HAROLD ARLEN is the last of the great composers of his generation,but certainly not the least talented one,even if BROADWAY often eluded him.Sit down,fix yourself a drink and enjoy.If you like this,you can also buy the 2 cds who offers a good resum&eacute; of the whole collection of OSCAR PETERSON's tributes to the composers.

Like many before me, those two records were my introduction to the music of RICHARD RODGERS and LORENZ HART.I have listened to all of ELLA's songbooks, so i can say to you that this collection is the best although they are all interesting.BUDDY BREGMAN's arrangments are often breathtakingly beautiful.I really like the versions of many songs like I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS,WHERE OR WHEN ,THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL and ISN'T IT ROMANTIC.RODGERS AND HART were so perfectly matched together;RODGERS is such a great melodist and HART had a unique way for playing with words.His cynical approach was only a facade of his sensibility.Revivals of their classic shows:ON YOUR TOES,BABES IN ARMS,THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE and PAL JOEY still delivers the goods today.In all 1920-1943, they wrote around 550 songs.To celebrate the music of RICHARD RODGERS is never a task,it's a pleasure.

Perfect collection for anyone who wants to get to know one of AMERICA's greatest songwriter.MERCER did everything in the music business:a singer,a co-founder of CAPITOL records in 1942,but mostly a great natured man from the friendly town of SAVANNAGH,GEORGIA.Virtually every singer from SINATRA to ROSEMARY CLOONEY has sung his songs that are easily recognizable.JOHNNY had a flair for writing lyrics to music like few people.It always seems so easy when you hear his songs .Isn't that the recipe for any writer of songs,to make them sound simple?This collection gives you a sample of MERCER's incredible production (more than a thousand tunes).

Partially filmed in the MONTR&Eacute;AL forum, before it was closed down(the place where the famous hockey club had their glory days),SNAKE EYES is a typical product of this neurotic director who often let's his vision go on top to the displeasure of those who likes logic.Having said that,i have to say that i enjoyed this thriller a lot,even if you must go over the first half,and that's not easy.The film is build like a puzzle until you get to know the important facts about the murder that took place during the boxing fight.Some people might be turned off by this ,but be patient and you'll be rewarded.CAGE and SINISE have fun with their characters.

Even technical problems can't take a hold on a talent like SARAH VAUGHAN ,who manages to improvises in the process of delivering WILLOW WEEP FOR ME and HOW HIGH THE MOON.The fact that she always enjoyed recording in a trio setting tells a lot about her stature as a singer.SARAH doesn't need to be surrounded by horns and strings;she most of the times use her voice like a musician in a true display of an incredible range that was admired by the likes of opera singers.If you've heard I'M GONNA SIT DOWN AND WRITE MYSELF A LETTER and DANCING IN THE DARK done by CROSBY or SINATRA,theses songs are treated in the so called SASSY mold;she slows them down and realizes a totally original interpretation,so that it is almost unrecognizable.An ordinary singer could not have done that,but as you know,SARAH VAUGHAN was no ordinary singer.

This documentary about one of the greatest ballad singer of his time has all a documentary should have including clips of his widow that tells a lot about what kind of man he really was;revealing television appearances in different shows including his own that was sadly put off by the sponsors after a few years;FRANK SINATRA,ELLA FITZGERALD and HARRY BELLAFONTE also add their opinions.The most important thing here is that new generations can get to know why NATHALIE COLE's father was so much loved in his lifetime.The stories of his attack by white men is shameful and so is the one about their residence in CALIFORNIA,but unfortunally they also are a part of his life.Finally, i would say that hearing STARDUST at the end pleased me a lot since it is probably the best version ever of this song.

When i first bought this book ten years ago, i was already an old rock fan but i didn't know much about JEROME KERN and IRVING BERLIN even if their names were familiar;this book made me aware of them.Plots,songs and original cast of all the classic musicals from SHOWBOAT to the present time are included here.What was the name of that musical in which MARY MARTIN first made MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY a popular song;you'll find out.Were was JIMI HENDRIX born?Why are the early LOUIS ARMSTRONG recordings so important to the developpment of jazz and popular music?Who founded LE CHAT NOIR that famous cabaret that made ARISTIDE BRUANT a well known name around MONTMARTRE and after that throughout FRANCE.I could go on and on , but since i don't want to bore you,i'll suggest that you get a copy of that book and cancel your plans for the week-end because if you like music, you'll be hooked for good.

At first,it seems it's gonna be an austere movie due to the theme(religious life in the thirties).But if you are patient,this story should win over because it's treatment is first rate.As usual,AUDREY is excellent as SISTER LUC who gradually after many experiences decides to quit religious life.PETER FINCH as a surgeon in CONGO has one of his best early role.Based on a true story,the film tells it's tale the way it must be tell,without fancy camera work.You should enjoy the second half best.It was AUDREY HEPBURN's second dramatic part after her bad experience in WAR AND PEACE.Even if times and religious life are not to be judged by today's standards,this film makes it clear that you enter this kind of life at the own expense of your true nature.Of great interest if you have someone in your family or a friend living this kind of experience.

Fine musical approach ,with musicians obviously enjoying themselves with the arrangments letting all of them shine with appropriate solos.Our singer sings her best, but i must admit that the tendancy to let the final notes go on forever gets annoying at times.I would not have been honest if i didn't mention this.It's hard to erase from our memory LOUIS ARMSTRONG's version of ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET,even with the added verse included here.Every other aspect of this cd is done with good taste ,and JIMMY McHUGH certainly deserve a tribute like this one.Now miss WHITFIELD,how about a tribute to WALTER DONALDSON or VINCENT YOUMANS?That would be nice.

MacORLAN's world is about marines,prostitutes,lonely soldiers and people who grew up too fast.This universe is so well transcribed into these songs as to become irrestibly charming.MONIQUE MORELLI's voice is at ease with this kind of material;it suits her perfectly.Along with JULIETTE GRECO,she came to represent the best writers of songs often neglected by the mainstream crowd.MORELLI once had a cabaret in MONTMARTRE.MacORLAN was also a novelist,and NELLY was actually a character of QUAI DES BRUMES that was well transcribed to the screen in 1938.This cd is less than 40 minutes long,but every minute is well employed and you certainly get your money's worth here,that's guarantee.

The star here is the director of photography CHRISTOPHER CHALLIS who did a great job trowing everything from a fantasy sequence with PECK having a nightmare and enjoying a most dangerous bike ride in the steets to the pursuit of our heroes who must run for their lives while enjoying a horse ride.The star here is also SOPHIA LOREN wearing the clothes designed by CHRISTIAN DIOR.She is gorgeous in this movie which seems a perfect tribute to her beauty.Add the music of HENRY MANCINI, the beautifully designed opening titlesthat are of course reminiscent of JAMES BOND and you're in for good entertainment.The script which is the weakest aspect of the movie is fill with funny in jokes that makes up for the coherence of the whole.Originally, the film was 13 minutes longer.A message to the guys:would you have liked to be in GREGORY PECK's place during the shower scene ?

Without a doubt,this is the best overview of CHARLES TRENET on a single cd.It collects all his best songs,and you'll notice that from QUE RESTE-IL DE NOS AMOURS on,there is a new nostalgic approach in his songs.In his early years 1936-1943 CHARLES is a young man ,who having been in contact with surrealists figures ,is deeply influenced by this group.When the war arrives,the drama being more natural,it seems to inspire him to write melancolic songs,and those i think are his most fondly remembered today.I really like COIN DE RUE ,who symbolizes the world of his youth from a personnal experience,and also LE JARDIN EXTRAORDINAIRE which allows CHARLES to display his fantasy.These are the two aspects of CHARLES TRENET.Anyone with an interest in FRENCH music should buy this cd.

The two sides of CHARLES AZNAVOUR are well represented here in these two originals LPS of 1964.Jazz oriented songs alterns the love songs who have become a trademark for AZNAVOUR, who favours anguish type of love songs of which he had by then become a master.After years of struggling,first in the shadow of EDITH PIAF(he was once her chauffeur),and then the target of critics who did not accept his character,AZNAVOUR has deserved his reputation in the eyes of his fans.Many songs like HIER ENCORE and A MA FILLE among others, are forever associated with him.

I read that novel a few years ago,and this film i beleive does it justice.The fact that the author himself did the adaptation to the screen helps a lot;after all it is his baby.Previous adaptations of JOHN IRVING'S books(THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP and THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE(a mess))were not of the same quality.There are however two points i want to single out here:the fact that HOMER can practice medecine with a fake diploma is rather hard to take;it is also never explain to us why the doc(MICHAEL CAINE)always needs ether to find some sleep.Is he a drug addict?Personnaly,i would have cut the episode of the black man having made his own daughter pregnant,but it helps us to understand that HOMER has not lost what he had learned before.

2002 is going to be quite a year for all musical comedy fans and it's greatest figure who will be celebrating his centenary anniversary.But you fan can start right away by buying this wonderful record which remains the best version of the show available.Everyone who saw the show knows that in the film YOU'RE A QUEER ONE JULIE JORDAN;the first half of WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE ASLEEP(a big mistake),GERANIUMS IN WINTER and BLOW HIGH, BLOW LOW were not edited because they thought the film would have been too long.This was not DICK and OSCAR's decision of course.In his latest years(RICHARD RODGERS died in 1979)nothing please more the composer than seeing his favorite show live in theaters.The cast in the film was simply perfect from JULIE to JIGGER and GORDON McCRAE was much more than a subsitute for FRANK SINATRA ;he gave to his character his own approach and he was a very good singer.I can understand SHIRLEY JONES when she says in the liner notes that she would like the show to be filmed again.For 1956, it was an excellent movie.More than 40 years after their last show,RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN remain unmatched and the reprise of their 5 masterpieces throughout the world is always an event.

So it is out of stock,but if you are patient,they will bring it back,even if many fans prefer the 1950 version.I discovered the show with that record and i still love it to this day.My only complaint is that the ballet JOEY LOOKS INTO THE FUTURE was not included here(the 1950 record and the 1995 revival have it).HELEN GALLAGHER is a knockout as GLADYS;DICK BEAVERS had a hard time fitting HAROLD LANG's shoes but he tries his best.What makes this show so great is the balance of uptempo numbers with the slower ones ,which brings you to the edge of your seat.It has everything a show needs:sass,humour,good looking girls and most important great songs.It also inspired BROADWAY at the time 1940 to go ahead with more adult oriented shows.Few lyric writers could really write such different shows like THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE and PAL JOEY,but HART was a master in his field.If PAL JOEY bores you,there must me a problem with you;you should consult a shrink.

Yesterday ,before going to sleep,you told your wife:I have nothing against FRENCH operettas,but what i want to hear is the songs ,not the dialogue that goes with the genre when you listen to complete works.Here in that collection,all the composers who created that particular form of light music are represented.It is so much more entertaining than traditional opera.Among the highlights are songs from OFFENBACH's works like LA BELLE H&Eacute;LENE and LA P&Eacute;RICHOLE;MESSENGER's VERONIQUE and MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE;the famous LA VEUVE JOYEUSE that was successfull around the world;CHRISTIN&Eacute;'s PHI PHI created the day after armistice in 1918.One of the pleasant surprize for me was hearing songs from LES MOUSQUETAIRES AU COUVENT and one from LA FILLE DE MADAME ANGOT (JADIS,LES ROIS)and another from CIBOULETTE(NOUS AVONS FAIT UN BEAU VOYAGE).MADY MESPL&Eacute;,one of the best singers of the genre is featured on seven songs,and she is always a joy to hear in any role of the repertoire.FRANCIS LOPEZ, who is remembered as the last important composer is well honoured with eight selections with singers like BOURVIL,GEORGES GU&Eacute;TARY and LUIS MARIANO.Don't try to resist THE MERRY WIDOW ,she'll get to you one way or another.

Perhaps this musical is a little cute by today's often cynical standard,but that's because we lost the ability to dream.I beleive this film to be ASTAIRE's last good musical along with THE BAND WAGON.Not surpringly,FRED had starred with his sister ADELE in the 1927 original GERSHWIN show.What is important here is not the story but it's treatment full of ingenious fresh ideas by director DONEN.For example,the use of color is often amazing;you can actually feel the makers had a field day playing with it.The wedding sequences are fun to watch.We all know that AUDREY HEPBURN could have been FRED's daughter.To tell you the truth, i don't mind because they dance so well together.

With her limited vocal range,JUNE has made wonders.She was perhaps the worst judge of her own talent.These two albums of 1957 are wonderful to say the least.JUNE has what other singers sometimes lack:a heart and that is the main reason she remains rather unique among the jazz singers of her generation.Notice how she along with her musical director is able to pick the right songs for her.JUNE is a terrific ballad singer ,deeply moving in a most unusual way.Once she takes a particuliar song,she manages most of the time to display a kind of melancolic charm that stays with you a long time.Those songs almost bring us a sort of portrait of the woman.One is inclined to think that the few up tempo numbers in this selection of songs were asked by CAPITOL to help the sells.God bless JUNE CHRISTY!

Ever since the delightful FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL came to set the new fashion for modern romantic comedies of our time,producers have tried to duplicate its success often in vain.The freshness of it's appeal is not recreated here;this is mainly another tailor made part for JULIA.The parody of DIONNE WARWICK in the early days did not make me laugh;i was rather annoyed by it, because i love those old BURT BACHARACH songs,but ok,after all this is a comedy.If you care, the song THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT was written by DOROTHY FIELDS and set to music by JEROME KERN in 1936.What was the name of that actress again? ANDIE MCDOWELL the L'OREAL girl.Gee whiz ,i miss her.Am i the only one for god's sake?

This movie based on CHURCHILL's own memoirs about his younger days is definitely worth seeing,even if RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH has made the mistake of beleiving everything he read as the absolute truth.Like all good writers,WINSTON CHURCHILL knew how to capturate the attention of his readers by exagerating on a few topics.Still,there are priceless moments about his father who died from a debilating tumor.ROBERT SHAW gives a good performance,and so does SIMON WARD as CHURCHILL.The film ends with WINSTON giving his famous speech that will make his reputation.You can catch JANE SEYMOUR briefly and later a certain ANTHONY HOPKINS then mostly a theater actor.

As successful as it was,MY FAIR LADY was never in the CAROUSEL-KISS ME KATE category of great musicals.This film had fine production values;the casting was good;the dialogue gets often annoying and detracts from the songs who come too far in between.Along with THE SOUND OF MUSIC,it signaled the end of an era of decent musicals.This film is actually like a big balloon that never seems to get to the ground.Still, there are delightful moments that keeps it from sinking and makes it worth seeing;my favorite is the scene that has ELIZA swear in the company of society fashion.AUDREY we miss you and nobody really took the place you filled so well between 1952 and 1967.

The best footage of this document ,that is certainly not a complete documentary on DEAN ,are the black and white clips of the singer who sings THAT'S AMORE,OH MARIE and MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS ,and the duets with PETULA CLARK and PEGGY LEE.Mostly,this is a reminicence of the 60's show commented by the producer, who obviously had a great relationship with DEAN.Don't look for clips of the movies with JERRY LEWIS or the films he made with SINATRA.There's nothing about the RAT PACK or LAS VEGAS. Very little also about his humble beginnings in showbussiness,before the radio show and the signature with CAPITOL records.One of the best moment has DEAN missing a lyric while singing BLUE MOON.So ,this is a pleasant affair,but if you are looking for a complete biography ,you are bound to be disapointed.

Never let an aspiring pianist listen to this version of MASSENET's ELEGY,this could discourage him forever.TATUM was not what you call a salon pianist;he was much more a virtuoso that ones listen to for kicks.It is true however that he was unique among the pianists of his generation.You simply can not duplicate this guy who remains in a class by himself.As good as this collection is to summarize him,i still prefer the BEST OF on PABLO, but you can also settle for this one without a guilty feeling.

Bop's greatest pianist is well sampled here.This is a good cd if you don't know his music.BUD's flawless right hand technique still mesmerize after all these years.Most of these numbers are his own compositions.POWELL was a classically trained pianist before he heard a certain ART TATUM who became his idol.I for myself always admired the way he plays the ballads.Like his mates PARKER,GILLESPIE and MONK,BUD is a fast thinker at the keyboard.The only fault of this cd is it's time slot:37 minutes,but it is well employed.All the stuff here are from what is generally considered his greatest years;there is nothing from the last ten years.The title of one of the track GLASS ENCLOSURE,could easily be the title of his biography.

Generally interesting best of recordings of PEGGY with CAPITOL.What is MISS LEE's greatest strenght is that she can take ordinary songs and transform them so it seems they are better when she sings them.FEVER is a perfect example;this song was also recorded by ELVIS in the early sixties.You should not be disapointed if you buy that record.However be warned,if you need one collection from PEGGY,you must buy the 1952-1956 DECCA collection which really shows her wide range better than this.Long time fans will enjoy this side of PEGGY LEE.

JAMES BROWN's sexual appeal has of course lost the ability to schock when gangster rap came around a few years ago.Still,he was the first one to use music as an exciting aphrodisiac,a sort of prelude before the act.I was always much more a WILSON PICKETT fan,because he is such a driving force.The problem with JAMES BROWN is that the lyrics just seem so futile that you could do without them.That package gives you the meat you asked for,just don't think about it too much.The grandfather of soul ,he remains a great performer;it is on stage so much more than in a recording studio ,that JAMES BROWN really comes alive.

Many priceless scenes with GEORGES C.SCOTT giving the best performance of his career. Among the highlights:PATTON and MONTGOMERY battling for their personnal ego;the general giving a slap to a war wounded and paying the price for his misconduct;his incredible knowledge about the history of wars;his incapacity to deal with the authority of his superiors etc.A truely fascinating study of a remarkable man who had guts.

OLIVER STONE by now has treated every theme possible about the AMERICAN institutions.He has sometimes succeeded in doing so(PLATOON,BORN IN THE FOURTH OF JULY,JFK);sometimes he failed miserably(HEAVEN AND EARTH,NIXON).ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a fair movie about that marvelous AMERICAN institution called football.The usual four letter words are present;the overuse of montage is also on display;these are two items you can always find in any STONE movie.Characters often talk all in the same time.Yet ANY GIVEN SUNDAY has entertaining value,and tells a few truths well included in the script(Television killed that sport).CHARLTON HESTON a real AMERICAN legend has one scene;the use of clips of BEN-HUR is out of place.One of the pleasant surprize of this film is the performance of CAMERON DIAZ as the team's owner.As for AL PACINO,he gives his usual foul mouthed speeches,sometimes annoying,sometimes on target.If you don't think about it too much,you can actually swallow this piece of AMERICAN junk without trowing up.Good luck!

Part three of the so called AMERICAN trilogy by director STEVENS after A PLACE IN THE SUN and SHANE.Before making this film that gave him his star status, ROCK HUDSON had made a few romantic movies with SIRK.Basically, this is an elegant soap opera with a few overblown touches that fortunately don't detract the overall effect.The set pieces makes the film quite unique as a whole.JAMES DEAN in his last role gets the MARLON BRANDO award for making all his gestures count.ELISABETH is at her best, even if it's hard to imagine she can age so fast during the film.Of great historical interest since it was probably the most awaited movie of 1956.

Here is a perfect start for anyone interested in GAINSBOURG'S music.This collection is an excellent overview that will give you the variety of his range.When LULU(his nickname) started recording in 1958,he was into his chansonnier trip,but his originality was all there from the beginning.He was willing to go elsewhere and quickly he included different influences like bossa nova and later on y&eacute; y&eacute; music(a sort of toned down BRITISH INVASION stuff with FRENCH overtones),disco,conceptual albums and even reggae and rap.It is that curiousity and overture to all kinds of music that makes him such an interesting figure.Ten years after his death,he has become a cult figure that new artists discover as years go by.GAINSBOURG was a complex man who didn't take himself seriously;that's a key aspect of his personnality.He was talented to be sure,no one can deny that.Like many great artists,he usually worked fast and often changed his songs just before he recorded them.Buy this and then buy HISTOIRE DE M&Eacute;LODIE NELSON and L'HOMME A LA TETE DE CHOU,his two masterful concept albums.It's clear now that LULU won't be forgotten by his fans,and to tell you the truth the guy deserves it.

What have in commun BREL,BRASSENS,B&Eacute;ART,GAINSBOURG,FERR&Eacute;,CARCO,MaCORLAN and many others?They have all had songs recorded by JULIETTE GR&Eacute;CO,one of FRANCE's true lasting monument.BREL and GAINSBOURG were virtually unknowns when JULIETTE choose their songs for recordings.This overview of her career that span more than 50 years hits home.If you were a young composer or lyric writer in the fifties and the sixties,you simply had to ring her bell.With the deaths of CHARLES TRENET(he is also present here)and GILBERT B&Eacute;CAUD,GR&Eacute;CO is now the surviving legend of FRENCH music along with AZNAVOUR.In her autobiography JUJU,JULIETTE said this:I always missed my mother's lack of love towards me.She was somehow in a way adopted by the fans.

JACQUES PR&Eacute;VERT was a famous scriptwriter in the thirties and forties and also a poet.This cd is YVES MONTAND'S 1962 tribute to the man who helped him gained stardom in FRANCE.LES FEUILLES MORTES that YVES had first recorded in the forties has become world famous ,ever since FRANK SINATRA and NAT KING COLE had the good fortune of included it in their repertoire in the fifties.The other two highlights here are EN SORTANT DE L'&Eacute;COLE and BARBARA,very well put to music.The rest is unfortunately not as interesting;it raises the eternal debate of transfering poems into songs.When it works, like the three exemples cited,it can be marvelous;when it fails ,it becomes annoying.Still, that record was worth doing, and has a place in the heart of YVES MONTAND fans.

Eversince PRINCE and rap groups made their sexual fantaisies musically fashionable in the 80's and 90's,the theme by itself has lost the ability to schock.In 1973,LET'S GET IT ON was the new opus by the man we often called the original lover man.This record is certainly not a masterpiece, but it is in fact a pleasant soul product that can be described as a prelude to the ever pop fascination with love and sex that are so overwhelming today.Listen to it for what it is and you should enjoy it.MARVIN will always have his place in the heart of soul fans of the sixties and seventies.He was as we often said the handyman of MOTOWN ,who started as a drummer and end up being one of the company's biggest star.

MOUSTAKI is the FRENCH equivalent of the zen philosophy.This budget price cd is perfect because it gives a sort of adequate portrait of the singer and the writer composer.I think that most of his fans can agree that it is a good introduction to his world.Two songs are live recordings;LES AMIS DE GEORGES is a tender tribute to BRASSENS that MOUSTAKI knew well;MA LIBERT&Eacute; and MA SOLITUDE were first recorded by REGGIANI;LE TEMPS DE VIVRE represents the singer's pr&eacute;occupation with his way of live, that is a definition of his idealism of peace and love.After a hard day of work,MOUSTAKI represents a good alternative before going to sleep.His voice is low and there is nothing about this guy that will stress you.If you like this cd,there is a excellent 4 cds box set overview of his career,the title is BALLADES EN BALLADE.

Cartoonish songs that wears out a formula so exausted by now.If you have to buy one,why not this one.The problem is that we were fifteen such a long time ago.I suggest to the mothers and fathers that they buy this to their timid son to arouse his listening sensibility.Am i kidding you here?I actually like THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST and THE TROOPER a lot.As for the rest,it is a matter of one's tolerance.But the father suddently remembering his younger days burst into tears saying isn't this a rip off of the old BLACK SABBATH albums?You know sometimes fathers can get to the point too.

If you only want one CHRISTMAS cd in your collection,you simply must choose this one.NAT and CHRISTMAS are linked together.This cd was beautifully remastered in 1999 and will pass the test of time forever.You may have listened to many CHRISTMAS albums in your lifetime,but very few have this overall quality of singing with a nice display of harmony behind it.What distinguished NAT is his great sensibility that always transpired in his best recordings.You'll want to comeback to it year after year.Only FRANK SINATRA's 1957 offering comes close in matching this classic for the ages.A big mistake for you would be to listen to it alone after many drinks.The tears just might come to you.

BRASSENS continue where he left us with his second lp.His r&eacute;putation rapidly grows in FRANCE with songs like BANC PUBLIC and PUTAIN DE TOI displaying his original style with subversive lyrics accompagnied only by another guitar and a bass.The list of later FRENCH folksingers who were influenced by these recordings is endless.BRASSENS when he started was really a sensation.It is worth mentionning that all the songs of the first two lps were written before his official debut in 1952.Like LE GORILLE from the previous lp,PUTAIN DE TOI wasn't allowed radio playing at all.We've come a long way since then.Bonus tracks are unnecessary,apart from a second hilarious live version of PUTAIN DE TOI,in which BRASSENS is clearly enjoying himself.

Fans of the group will want this first lp in their collection.PETE's writing skill will improve later on.This disc contains in an innocent way all the basics of the future,that will make THE WHO the greatest live rock band of their time.For now,PETE uses guitars that he bought in SWEEDEN(IKA),so that he can smashes them without having to fear that he won't have enough money to pay for his flat.Don't laugh while you listen to THE GOOD'S GONE and IT'S NOT TRUE ,even if it's funny to hear them.MY GENERATION and THE OX already shows the anarchic spirit of the group ;they also demonstrates that KEITH MOON was the most instinctive drummer in the history of rock.

An essential capsule from the sixties,HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is DYLAN reaching his peak.Remember 1965,it was the year THE BEATLES started to write more meaningfull lyrics to their songs.JOHN LENNON admitted having been influenced by DYLAN.The electric conversion had started with the previous lp.This disc has probably BOB's two greatest songs:LIKE A ROLLING STONE and the fabulous DESOLATION ROW,but the record is vintage from the beginning to the end.Forget those endless greatest hits packages that makes the industry roll and buy this,one of the truely recognized classic of an era.Who can forget lyrics like :HER PROFESSION IS HER RELIGION,HER SIN IS HER LIFELESSNESS preceeded by ON HER TWENTY SECOND BIRTHDAY SHE ALREADY IS AN OLD MAID.I mean that is strong my friend.

My sister dragged me to see this movie and i'm glad she did.I think that SALMA has good flair for producing the projects that fits her well.I won't bother you with the story, because AMAZON has done so very well.I was particularly impressed with the visual aspects like the funny KING KONG analogy when the couple go to NEW YORK and also the paintings that on some occasions seems to come alive to us.I also beleive that this biographical film tells a lot about an artist's life;the way an artist always needs further stimulations to go on.In the case of FRIDA's husband, well played by MOLINA,it's the extramarrital affairs that provides the drive.Isn't it funny the way he always toss those affairs by saying that it doesn't count for him?She finally has her revenge with TROSTKI.Finally, i'd like to say to SALMA to continue producing, because FRIDA was a pleasant surprize.

The old saying that says that a play can not become a satisfying movie is again the situation here.Although all the actors do play their roles convincigly,it's basically a play that can't be openned up.There is a feeling of mental distorsion throughout;two characters are affected by it.This convey a melancholic mood to the story.As it is ,i still enjoy the movie because of CATHERINE MCCORMACK and her fabulous ironic smile.I like the scene when she says to her son:come i'll put you to bed,perhaps because i envy the kid.

Arguably not for everytaste,this supernatural story about a black convict who did not kill the two girls that will send him to the electric chair gets better if you are patient enough to go through it's shakey and long first half.We've got to give TOM HANKS credit for his pick of roles;he is always fun to watch in almost anything.This type of story will always find detractors who can't cope with this kind of storytelling in a movie.A story that has a mouse that lives eternally is after all quite special,even in our time.Don't you think?

A very enjoyable concept album about ELTON and lyric writer BERNIE TAUPIN&quot;S early days in the music business,at a time when they were not worldwide names.The added singles of the time only make it more enjoyable,even if they do not fit well,but this is only a detail.Most artists try at one time or another to remember their early days;the difference is that ELTON AND BERNIE have succeeded in doing it, and have managed to remain creative in the project.Belongs in the top 5 category of the singer.

This cd has the best version of ST-LOUIS BLUES ever recorded,8 minutes of pure magic ,but it also delivers many other delightful moments, the most important being to experience LOUIS and his musicians rehearsing some of their numbers before recording them.LOVELESS LOVE is my personal favorite and LOUIS wondering how did food get in here is funny.The recording voice of W.C.HANDY explaining how he met SCHATMO was a good thing to add.True fans will not want to miss this meeting of two giants of AMERICAN popular music.

MON ONCLE ANTOINE is about rural life and the coming of age of a teenage boy whose uncle is an embalmer.Slow moving but immensely rewarding;one can feel the director's tenderness for his characters.The film can be hard to appreciate if you don't speak FRENCH or don't know much about the aspects of rural life in QUEBEC and it's mentality..JUTRA the director, plays a little part in the general store.JEAN DUCEPPE who plays ANTOINE was a very well known actor in QUEBEC;he formed his own theater company in 1973 ... Along the way,the teenage boy also makes his sexual awakening in a funny voyeurism scene in which some women comes to the general store to renew their wardrobes.The film remains the director's most acclaim work.JUTRA sadly died of the ALZHEIMER disease in 1986.

With ROUND MIDNIGHT and KIND OF BLUE,SKETCHES OF SPAIN is among the best of MILES.Not only the title tracks delivers but all the numbers reach their goals of letting you melt into the FLAMENCO flavour in mysterious ways.You probably heard the concerto's adagio before ,but maybe did not know that MILES recorded it if you are not a jazz fanatic.Let there be known here that the bonus tracks are not just fillers.Some say that this is elevator type of music;nonsense,it's just that they could not elevated themselves high enough to get down and listen to it.Worth having in your music library for sure.

There's nothing like seeing that movie for the first time.You'll probably wonder about the story,but you'll be entertained and certainly won't be bored.No other HITCHCOCK movie can match this one in terms of sheer entertainment.Suspense,comedy relief and unexpected things happening from real one to the end.I still remember the thrill of watching it for the very first time at the CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY's repertory theater.HITCHCOCK's direction,LEHMAN's script and HERRMANN's music blend perfectly.Among my favorite scenes:MASON slapping LANDAU because he missed his assignment;MARIE SAINT's quiet beauty in her love scenes with GRANT;the classic cropdusting sequence;the anxiety of watching GRANT getting away from the mansion etc.This is ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S greatest movie of all time.

I always considered the EVANS-DAVIS collaboration an intellectual one and the COLTRANE-DAVIS collaboration an intuitive one.So naturally,apart from SKETCHES OF SPAIN i do not rave over their mutual recordings.What's the point of making a PORGY AND BESS record without the singing or the continuity?Where is I GOT PLENTY OF NOTHIN and why GONE ,an original not even composed by the GERSHWINS?For me,this is a rather unpleasant affair.I enjoyed it more from track 9 on.If you want to hear PORGY AND BESS ,but do not want to hear the complete work,try ELLA and LOUIS who gave us a near perfect sampler.I won't win new friends with my review,but as the man says,you've got to say what you think.I must admit that upon reading the other reviewers,i feel lonely.

Four songs make this disc a treasure to cherish:ALL OF ME,SATURDAY NIGHT,BODY AND SOUL and TIME AFTER TIME are all incredibly nostalgic because in the case of the two SAMMY CAHN songs,these are the originals versions.The way the orchestra cooks on SATURDAY NIGHT is so representative of the forties it makes you wish to go back in that era.Many other songs are dated by today's standards,but the overall overview of the COLUMBIA years is perfectly realized.Many of these songs were recorded again in FRANK's CAPITOL years.It is fascinating to cite an example to compare I'M A FOOL TO WANT YOU with the one recorded in 1957 on the WHERE ARE YOU album.Fortunately for his fans,FRANK did not record THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE again.This is the SINATRA that women were crazy about to the point of even neglecting their husbands.Luckily for us,those days are over.

Fans of TONY BENNETT who don't want to spend too much must choose between three collections:THE ESSENTIAL, THE ULTIMATE and that ALL TIME GREATEST HITS.Either one should do the trick ,since all the better known songs are included.The FORTY YEARS box set is of course more complete and will satisfy long time fans much more being a more complete overview of the man.You have now no excuses to leave your heart in SAN FRANCISCO.If you know TONY,ask him if he'd like to record a tribute to JOHNNY MERCER.

It may not be his best,but it's very pleasant listening from the beginning to the end.I like TONY's version of LOVE FOR SALE a lot with it's terrific bossa nova arrangement that almost makes you beleive it's another song.It's hard not to think of PERRY COMO when you hear I'M ALWAYS CHASING RAINBOWS but again TONY manages to delivers his own special rendition.At that time 1962,the singer is in full control of his voice.About the only complaint is the running time;wouldn't it have been great to have it on a 2 lps on 1 cd collection?Check out TONY's little mistake on the last number THE BEST IS YET TO COME;they kept it for fun.

Remember 1972,when the PHILADELPHIA FLYERS were the most scared NHL hockey team with goons like SCHULTZ and SALESKI.O.K. maybe i anticipated a little,they won the cup in 1974 and 1975.Anyway,wherever you were in 1972,you could not escape the PHILLY sound of THE O'JAYS who literally stole soul and send it to PHILADELPHIA after years of DETROIT dominance.If THE O'JAYS were to put them on the map,GAMBLE and HUFF had emerged a few years before, writing and producing for JERRY BUTLER and WILSON PICKETT.The only negative side of this record, is that it spawned disco music(beurk!)until 1980.....

This is another good sample of MANCINI's music.Among the highlights are ANDY WILLIAMS's MOONRIVER and CHARADE;JOHNNY MATHIS's DARLING LILI and WHISTLING AWAY THE DARK;PATTI PAGE's DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.All those songs written by the great JOHNNY MERCER.MANCINI was a master in his field,the JOHN WILLIAMS of the previous era.The music of MANCINI will live on way after you and me have passed out.Fans should also check out the SARAH VAUGHAN songbook devoted to MANCINI.

This offering is certainly not among TONY's greatest achievement.It is true that the concept is done tastefully,but there are four very ordinary songs:LET THERE BE LOVE,CRAZY RHYTHM,THE BEAT OF MY HEART and SO BEATS MY HEART FOR YOU.Somehow,i have the feeling that mister BENNETT was at the time sleeping alongside a drum set.You will notice that LOVE FOR SALE is virtually the same recording used in the lp I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO.The added tracks are indeed welcome here ,and can not be considered fillers.A medium BENNETT, for those who followed him from the beginning.

Contrary to his contempories (BREL,BRASSENS),it took L&Eacute;O longer to make it as a singer and songwriter.In the fifties,his songs were more successfull when recorded by others like JULIETTE GR&Eacute;CO.By the time of these recordings however ,he had really found himself as an artist.This collection is a must have for his fans.Why you may ask?Simply because it contains many famous songs like PANAME,COMME A OSTENDE and MERDE A VAUBAN forever associated with him.This is the L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute; that everybody likes.It is important to know that FERR&Eacute; had many styles during his career, including a rock one.His general output was often controversial,but this is the price one has to pay for being his own person.It would be better(but not essential)to know about FRENCH slang to really appreciate this cd.Rock fans should go elsewhere;folkies will enjoy.

These two 1975-76 lps reunited on 1 cd are to say the least very enjoyable.This is not the usual songbook devoted to the composer.GRAPPELLI manages to play with those PORTER tunes and ends up winning in the process to make them sounds his own with his instrument.It's a good example of the way a musician can pay tribute to a composer and let his personnality express his true musicianship, without losing grip of the general focus of the project.Grade A.

This was FRANCE's fourth album written by her husband MICHEL BERGER and it is perhaps the best because by then MICHEL had found the perfect balance in using his wife's charms.Later on ,D&Eacute;BRANCHE and BABACAR also good albums, will make use of rhythm boxes ,since it was the fashion at the time ,and it will overheilm FRANCE a little, but certainly not completely.TOUT POUR LA MUSIQUE is a perfect opener simple and effective;LES ACCIDENTS D'AMOURS is really made for her;R&Eacute;SISTE is a good commercial song;LA PRIERE DES PETITS HUMAINS shows her humanism;VAHIN&Eacute; is a reggae delight.In all, this is an album you will want to play often.

I have an old edition of THE ROLLING STONE ALBUM GUIDE who ranked this gem **and and a half,so naturally i said to myself,i'll buy it at the end of my FRANK SINATRA collection,since this is the last CAPITOL album.Strangely(maybe the ROLLING STONE reviewer was drunk when he reviewed it),this is my second favorite ballad album from SINATRA(the first being CLOSE TO YOU).This cd is full of hidden treasures(let it be known),it is definitely not a filler program.It was a very good idea to include FRANK's first recordings with the label.In a way it is a fitting ending to the marvelous theme oriented CAPITOL collection albums.Don't wait at the end to get this,follow your instincts who are telling you to go to the nearest AMAZON store now.If you are tired,you might fall asleep listening to it,but LEAN BABY(being the only swinger) will wake you up.Never let a critic influence your jugment;i learned my lesson.

Although she had made a few records before,MAURANE really established her reputation by appearing in a version of STARMANIA,the most famous FRENCH musical.Since then, she has earned quite a reputation as a live singer.This cd is really a portrait of her;IL NEIGE DES E-MAILS is of course about the joy of emailing throughout the world;JEAN-PHILLIBERT is actually her cat;L'HOMME QUI M'A LE PLUS MANQU&Eacute; is her father.Excellent production and a good choice of writers and composers have managed to make this her best album to date.Be warned however ,that MAURANE really comes alive when she sings live.She is some kind of a girl as would say her colleagues ,who knows she can reach the highest peak of a mountain.Thank GOD there are artists like MAURANE.

I can't understand why this disc is out of stock.This collection is actually the complete SINATRA recordings of MERCER songs during his CAPITOL years.Including here are the two versions of DAY IN DAY OUT that are fascinating to compare.JEEPERS CREEPERS was in the first album that NELSON RIDDLE and FRANK made together in 1953;WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG was in the last CAPITOL album in 1962.SINATRA recorded many other MERCER tunes for his label REPRISE:MOONRIVER,DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES,EMILY etc.The superlatives you probably heard about this guy from SAVANNAGH are all true;no songwriter of his generation can symbolize his country better than MERCER;he remains the ultimate poet of the AMERICAN songbook.When you hear one of JOHNNY'S tune,you feel AMERICAN.

The five songs from PAL JOEY(THERE'S A SMALL HOTEL,I COULD WRITE A BOOK,THE LADY IS A TRAMP,BEWITCHED and I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS) are now included in the collection SINATRA IN HOLLYWOOD.The others were all in the CAPITOL albums 1953-1961.Many of these songs were recorded by FRANK back in the COLUMBIA days(WHEN OR WHEN,I COULD WRITE A BOOK etc.)but SINATRA's voice had deepened since then,and those versions are better.Strangely,the singer rarely sang MY FUNNY VALENTINE live and in PAL JOEY the song was lipsing by KIM NOVAK.The recording here from the CAPITOL's first album is a prime example of the way FRANK and NELSON RIDDLE made magic together( a great spare arrangement)Anyway,if you can find this cd in a used music store, because it is no longer available,grab it...The same thing can be said about the select JOHNNY MERCER,SAMMY CAHN and COLE PORTER.These are superior kind of packaging.

So many singers have recorded HANK WILLIAMS's songs after his death,that it is natural to get at least this two cds set that gives you most of the meat of his oeuvre.What distinguish WILLIAMS from others country stars of his generation is his naturelness that stands as authentic.There's a tendancy for people who are not fond of this kind of music to dismiss it ,like for instance professionnal wrestling because it's seems a fake.There's nothing quite like listening to songs like I'M SO LONESONE,I COULD CRY,HEY GOOD LOOKIN'(the original is still the best version)or JAMBALAYA.In fact,it simply definies the meaning of the word popular in a non selfish way.Getting down to bussinness,don't you think that BILL HALEY should have give royalties for using the music of MOVE IT ON OVER for ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK?Fifty years have gone by since HANK WILLIAMS's death,and while others have passed before and after,he can still be proud for being the guy who put country music on the map.

Don't expect originality in terms of movie direction, and you won't be disapointed by this film that gives you satire and also offers blackmailing as the main plot.Top performances by EVERETT and MOORE who seems to enjoy playing their roles;i personnaly prefer when CATE BLANCHET plays meatier characters ,but she also does a fine job.It is true that this film ressembles a masterpiece theater PBS presentation, except for the fact that it's not boring.One easily recognizes the shadow of writer OSCAR WILDE through adaptations of his works.WILDE is all about hypocrisy and how it affects our lives;he was also a master of irony as well seen in this story,especially at the end.

The fine songs of MAURICE VIDALIN who died in 1986,plus some other good ones by PIERRE DELANOE make this another good tribute to GILBERT B&Eacute;CAUD.The original BECAUD LPS are still not available on the market(maybe next year)for the cd crowd.Highlights here are LA GROSSE NOCE(a typical VIDALIN song that seems to be improvised)and UN PEU D'AMOUR ET D'AMITI&Eacute;.LA FILLE DE NATHALIE is the follow up to BECAUD's classic NATHALIE ,about a guy who falls in love with a RUSSIAN student who works as a city guide.As late as 1997,BECAUD was still singing this song in concert.

To resume GILBERT B&Eacute;CAUD in one single cd is nearly impossible,but that collection gives it a valiant try.Over the years,GILBERT has use the talents of three lyrics writers(AMADE,DELANOE and VIDALIN)because he is mostly a composer.Each of these lyrics writers have done well with him,and VIDALIN was certainly the most gifted(MADEMOISELLE LISE,LES P'TITES MAM'SELLES,LA VENTE AUX ENCHERES),and there are many others like LES TANTES JEANNE,ROSY AND JOHN that you can find in other greatest hits cds.For AMERICANS,B&Eacute;CAUD is the FRENCH composer who wrote LET IT BE ME and WHAT NOW MY LOVE.There is a lot more than that because he has done hundred of songs.Amazingly,his originals LPS are still not available on cd;this is a mystery to me.

The most satisfying single cd featuring the songs of GILBERT B&Eacute;CAUD;it is also one of the few ones with liner notes ,with an excellent overview of his career.What makes this package interesting is that there are songs from all decades.It is a common fact among his fans ,that GILBERT reached his peak during the sixties,when PIERRE DELANOE and MAURICE VIDALIN wrote great songs to which he compose wonderful music.The good nature of B&Eacute;CAUD is contagious;he has ,like many country boys(he was born in TOULON)a great sense of humour.There is of course more to him than this,but this is a perfect start if you don't know him.

In 1995,there were 4 greatest hits cds released with some different list of songs.This one has TANTES JEANNE and ROSY AND JOHN from the early sixties;those two are delightful;LES CROIX is among his first recordings,but this version is not the 1954 original,but a good rerecording.As usual,his three lyric writers(AMADE,DELANOE and VIDALIN)are represented ,with each a few songs.When you know them well,you can recognize their style.AMADE is the serious poet;DELANOE is the craftsman;and VIDALIN is all fantasy and humour.The three of them actually makes GILBERT B&Eacute;CAUD what he became through the years.

SUSAN GRAHAM had me an addict of her voice with her marvelous songs of REYNALDO HAHN,a treasure that i cherish.This FRENCH OPERETTA ARIAS is still a good cd,but lighter and fluffier.Not surprizingly, i consider the HAHN arias the highlight of this record.It seems to me that SUSAN has real affinities with the composer of CIBOULETTE and O MON BEL INCONNU.O MON BEL INCONNU and ETRE ADOR&Eacute; are wonderfully sung and are worth the price of the cd.I did not completely enjoy the first 4 numbers,although i should say that they are correctly done.Maybe i simply can't accept the fact that SUSAN can sing humourous stuff.Well that's my problem isn't it?I have the original version of J'AI DEUX AMANTS sung by YVONNE PRINTEMPS and the comparaison gives advantage to SUSAN.

This movie runs too long for it's own good ,butPAUL NEWMAN gives a valiant try at portraying a private detective hero. What i like best is the supporting acting, especially SHELLEY WINTERS who seems to play a character close to herself.The inevitable comparaison to the private detective heroes of HAMMETT and CHANDLER did not help this film.Still,it was the best of it's kind in the sixties.Fans of this kind of movies should also take a look at TONY ROME with SINATRA and MARLOWE with JAMES GARNER.

I read that book many years ago while at VICTORIA,B.C.where my sister lives.I had pick it up at a local library.It was actually the first real account of RODGERS and HART and their collaboration of twenty-three years(1920-1943),apart from DICK RODGERS's autobiography published the year before.Several passages of this book are about LARRY HART and his bout with booze that finally killed him at age 47.The story of how the show I MARRIED AN ANGEL was created is really something to read.Apparently,LARRY wrote half the lyrics of that show in one single night.If you like RODGERS and HART,you'll enjoy reading that book.There is only one problem:it was never reedited.Local librarys or used book stores are your alternatives.

Excellent overview of BRASSENS's life and career.By reading this,you'll know the important things about him;complete discography;his relation with JEANNE and her husband;the way PATACHOU first gave him his start by featuring him in her cabaret and by recording a few of his songs;you'll also learn that his misoginy was often overlooked in the fifties.In fact,he had a great tenderness feeling for them(women).It is also very interesting to know that behind many songs hide many of his friends with whom he had a lifetime relation.BRASSENS has influenced many FRENCH singers like MAXIME LE FORESTIER and RENAUD ,who like him gave emphasis to the lyrics of their songs.There is also about BRASSENS a terrific book released this year(i hope that they will translate it in ENGLISH);it's a complete scrapbook full of pictures,featuring originals sleeve LPS among other things;the title is BRASSENS AU BOIS DE MON COEUR 30 ANS DE CHANSONS by JEAN-PAUL SERMONTE.

A mix up war packaging of CHARLES TRENET songs ,offers well known songs along with some lesser known;those are often very interesting(PAPA PIQUE ET MAMAN COUD,FREDERICA)to dated(QUAND UN FACTEUR S'ENVOLE,SUR LE FIL).For the record,it is interesting to know that PAPA... was created for EDITH PIAF,but she simply could not sing it, stating that it was too complicated for her;FREDERICA was the title song of a movie.TRENET has often said that during the war years,since the theaters were not properly heated,he settled for movies as a diversion.So to resume,this is a collection that is not bad at all,but for a single cd,one should go for the ANTHOLOGY who covers 20 beautiful songs.

Like many, i had my doubts about a classical singer singing popular songs.Well, everyone makes mistakes and my doubts completely vanished when i heard this wonderful tribute to the songs of DICK AND LARRY.In fact at my humble opinion,this is the best tribute to the team since 1956 and ELLA FITZGERALD;that's a long time ago.DAWN succeeds in bringing new dimensions to these songs.I also enjoy the song selection:no LADY IS A TRAMP, no FUNNY VALENTINE but lesser known songs like HE WAS TO GOOD TO ME and EV'RY SUNDAY AFTERNOON just as good.This cd makes you realize how good LARRY HART was as lyric writer and how effortlessly RICHARD RODGERS seems to create melodies.It's a pleasure to write a critic and try to convince people to buy this.I think DAWN UPSHAW has found another admirer in her club.Go for it and judge by yourself.

Although he made excellent uptempo recordings with BILLY MAY,it is my beleive that NAT was at his best with GORDON JENKINS's lush orchestrations.The reason was simple:the man had great sensibility,and that type of material suits him fine.NAT was probably the best ballad singer of the fifties;he had a great natural understanding of the art of phrasing.LOVE IS THE THING has aged well;just take a song like WHEN I FALL IN LOVE,you can't imagine someone else who could make it sound like NAT;STARDUST was recorded by many artists,but again his version is among the best ever;even the songs that seems ordinary like IF LOVE AIN'T THERE or IRVING BERLIN'S MAYBE I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH receive an upgrade treatment.For me, the most pleasant surprize of this remarkable record is AIN'T MISBEHAVIN;it's almost not the same piece that LOUIS ARMSTRONG had recorded just a few years before.Romantics have the last word here;go for it,it's the nearest way to get to heaven for less than twenty bucks.

This second collaboration between FRANK and BILLY MAY is just as good as their previous COME FLY WITH ME.This is the type of cd one can play endlessely.I understand that CAPITOL had leftovers of FRANK to dispose,but the truth is that the added tracks are merely fillers to make the cd last longer.Why destroy the harmony of a great lp when it's not necessary?For sure,this is not a good reason enough not to buy this gem.It's fun to compare SATURDAY NIGHT( i prefer the original) and THE SONG IS YOU(i like this one best)with the COLUMBIA recordings of those songs.The fact that SINATRA could do the uptempos albums as well as the ballads oriented ones,shows why he was the greatest singer of the fifties.Remember what FRANK used to say about BILLY MAY;it is so accurate to say the least:It's like having a cold shower or a bucket of cold water thrown in your face.Buy it fast, because AMAZON will never have enough copies of this one.

There are more complete collection of DORIS DAY on the market,but at this price certainly this one delivers ,giving you 29 songs including some of her most fondly remembered songs.O.K. so they forgot to include liner notes but it goes with the price.Let's not forget that DORIS was dug by the likes of SARAH VAUGHAN who as you know,knew a thing or two about the art of singing.I especially enjoyed the 3 VINCENT YOUMANS songs that DORIS recorded for the movie TEA FOR TWO,and also those WALTER DONALDSON numbers from the movie LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME.DORIS had a real feeling for that 1920's material, but there are other fine moments as well.Like DINAH SHORE with whom she is often compared,DORIS DAY has remained fresh in the memory of her fans.Like SARAH,we also dig the lady and please let's erase that famous legend that she is suppose to be the virgin of AMERICA,because she deserves better.

Who cares if this cd is a package of PORTER's songs that SINATRA recorded during his years with CAPITOL?The important here is that you have a collection that you'll want to play often because it's a gasser.Try to find a better version of I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN is virtually impossible.The added tracks are from the movies HIGH SOCIETY and CAN CAN.The fact that NELSON RIDDLE arranged and conducted all these songs tells a lot about his natural feeling for the music of COLE PORTER.FRANK has often said that he considered JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS one of the trickest songs to sing.I've always liked MIND IF I MAKE LOVE TO YOU and YOU'RE SENSATIONAL because SINATRA sang them to GRACE KELLY in HIGH SOCIETY.Lucky fellow!

While this film really fizzles after less than an hour, you probably won't care because you'll be too busy watching lovely GRACE KELLY trying to make CARY GRANT her puppy.GRACE had charm,beauty,humour and class.Even HITCHCOCK got stuck in her web so that he forgot the script or maybe he did this on purpice for us.Thanks HITCH we appreciated.Costume designer EDITH HEAD had a field day designing the clothes here.Notice how CARY appears sort of tired in many scenes as though he could not wait to get to the nearest RIVIERA restaurant.TO CATCH A THIEF is really a recreation for a great director in the middle of his creative peak.

Assembled here are songs from operettas of the fifties and sixties.This is the mature TINO ROSSI,more than twenty years after his breakthrough in 1934.VINCENT SCOTTO the composer who brought him fame had died in 1952.FRANCIS LOPEZ who helped GEORGES GU&Eacute;TARY and LUIS MARIANO to become recording stars tried his talent with TINO.The result will be M&Eacute;DITERRAN&Eacute;E(the title track is not present here).Following the success of M&Eacute;DITERRAN&Eacute;E,there will be NAPLES AU BAISER DE FEU,LE TEMPS DES GUITARES and LE MARCHAND DE SOLEIL ,in which TINO will have the joy of working with his son LAURENT who wrote many of the songs.

LUIS MARIANO like GEORGES GU&Eacute;TARY will always be associated with composer FRANCIS LOPEZ.All three came to symbolize the french operettas of the forties and fifties;those operettas had often a SPANISH flavour.In this collection ,there is a little of everything:two songs in SPANISH(GRANADA makes him use his voice to the best effect);two CHRISTMAS songs(not present in other collections);and finally some songs from the operettas(incuding a french version of STANGER IN PARADISE)Missing are three famous songs forever associated with him(you can find them in the other collections)LA BELLE DE CADIX,ANDALOUSIE and MAMAN LA PLUS BELLE DU MONDE.

Compiled by the singer's son LAURENT,this is a super collection of the man with the honey voice.TINO ROSSI was the king of operetta in FRANCE.Along with his biggest hits(the choice of songs is perfect),it resumes a 50 year career and includes standards like AVE MARIA and J'ATTENDRAI among others.If you rave while listening to this man's voice,it's because there won't be singers like this anymore in the future.Our grand-mothers were simply nuts over this guy who made an art of serenating;so much that his followers could not rival his popularity.A priceless collection of a time who will never come back again,but can be revived magically with those 2cds.VINCENT SCOTTO and FRANCIS LOPEZ, the two kings of FRENCH operettas can sleep peacefully.

Initially divided in two distinctive sides in vinyl,this first album with producer BRIAN ENO remains one of BOWIE's finest achievement.Songs added here are not mere fillers but fit perfectly into the concept.ALWAYS CRASH IN THE SAME CAR is a delight;this is the type of song DAVID does best.The second half of the cd is a matter of taste,but just listen to the music and let your imagination do the rest.I have listened to HEROES and LODGER(both of interest)but somehow i always go back to LOW which remains my favorite BOWIE album;i simply enjoyed the experimental nature of the whole thing.

You can resume EDDIE COCHRAN very well with one cd.After all,when he died he was only 21 years old.This selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the LEGENDARY MASTER SERIES released in 1990.His best songs are there:SUMMERTIME BLUES was of course a favorite of THE WHO ,who often featured it in their concerts.I am particularly fond of JEANNIE,JEANNIE,JEANNIE,C'MON EVERYBODY and the marvellous SOMETHIN'ELSE with it's great shuffle,a trademark of EDDIE.If you are interested in rock's early days,you'll enjoy this cd.

Of great interest to any PORTER fan,because you actually can hear him sing 8 songs.Arguably,this is not the first cd you must choose to discover his music.I enjoyed hearing ANYTHING GOES from the voice of it's writer;this song,the title of one of PORTER's most famous show is often used in commercials.Among the highlights are THE PHYSICIAN,FIND ME A PRIMITIVE MAN and THE COCOTTE,not usually present in collections celebrating the composer.Should you buy it?If COLE PORTER is your favorite composer,yes.If not, you can let it go.If you've never heard his voice before,you could think like me,that he was born in a upper class manoir in ENGLAND.Of course,this is not the case because he was born in PERU,INDIANA.PORTER remains unique among the composers of his generation.His love of the FRENCH culture has always set him apart of his colleagues.

Is it possible not to like ELVIS'S golden records,especially since RCA have decided in 1997 to make them last longer than on their original release?The answer is no,you need at least the four cds that covers him well until 1968;volume5 is optionel.I personnaly discovered ELVIS with that collection,and you know what,it still delivers after thirty years.I've always liked A BIG HUNK OF LOVE and I GOT STUNG a lot.Maybe DON'T sounds corny by today's standards;the same can be said about MY WISH CAME TRUE but i don't care,this is the ELVIS we all loved.My title was of course a joke.After all,with all the look alike singer contest,everybody knows who he is,even if they never heard sing or seen his movies.

This is a perfect cd of MIREILLE if you want only one from her.Two nice duets with PAUL ANKA;FRENCH versions of ALWAYS ON MY MIND and WOMAN IN LOVE + hits like ACROPOLIS ADIEU and JE T'AIME AVEC MA PEAU.MIREILLE is an excellent singer with impeccable technique.Her detractors often say that she sings without emotion, but her fans have the last word because they know that MIREILLE has always remained faithful to her public.We should never compare her to EDITH PIAF, a very different type of woman and singer.PIAF used to live through the songs she sang,while MIREILLE is more like a professional athlete who knows her craft.

You know the old saying that courtroom movies are supposed to be boring right.Well forget that and enjoy this one which deals with a story that was worth telling.The story ressembles ERIN BROKOVICH in many aspects:it is about humans and the way a irresponsable corporation can cause deaths just because the job wasn't done right.ROBERT DUVALL in a supporting role steals the show,but JOHN TRAVOLTA is also well cast.You'll laugh when you'll see him get two speed contaventions in a row.You'll also understand while viewing this,why justice is a game that can get as far as morgatging your house as a guarantee for handling the debts of a trial.I'd rather see ten films like this rather than one mindless science-fiction techno action bore ,complete with heavy-metal music.

Any film dealing with two persons winning a case against a big company is worth doing in this world we live in .This is not a great directorial job from SODERBERGH, but usually a social intented story don't make a great film anyway.The important here is that JULIA ROBERTS gets the chance to play a different part and she does it well ,proving to the world that she has become an actress.ALBERT FINNEY provides a good supporting acting job.JULIA should keep all the clothes she wore in that movie;it might serves her well with producers in a few years.

Many people like new versions of classic shows, but not me.If possible, i always stick to the original to get the original feeling.Such is the case here with this show.Never beleive the cynics who say this show is inferior to OKLAHOMA or CAROUSEL, it's simply different.It's a curious mixture of popular with a touch of opera.Wonderful rousing overture that you can't duplicate because it's got that 1949 sound.MARY MARTIN had apprehension about singing with a real opera star, but it works well because DICK and OSCAR had managed to reduce to the minimum their songs together.It was a good idea to bring back MY GIRL BACK HOME for those who saw the film.Stick to the original recording and go see the revivals live.

I've been a regular buyer of MALTIN's book for many years.I usually buy it after my old copy wears out.I remember when LEONARD's only competitor was STEVEN SCHEUER who also had an annual guide.Nowadays,books of this type are legion.It is hard to put on the market a book like this for many reasons:taste is such a personnal thing;everyone's opinion can match a film critics most of the time.I admire MALTIN for persisting every year with a new &eacute;dition.You may contest some of his reviews,but this guy sincerly love movies and wants you to do the same if possible.Imagine the time you save by skipping the bad movies.Thanks LEONARD.Keep on coming back to us and don't forget the FRENCH movies.

Why you may ask a movie about ALI?After all,you can still view most of his championship fights on vid&eacute;o.The reason is that it gives WILL SMITH a good part to play.I didn't really appreciate the opening montage and this crosscutting with a SAM COOKE concert.I think that they wanted to show the emergence of black people in the sixties.I especially liked parts of the film like those funny press conferences in which ALI demonstrates his acting ability.If you actually accept what the script wants you to beleive,ALI is basically a womanizer.The religious aspect and the army jinks could not be tossed apart, simply because they really were an important issue at the time.Overall,this film should not mesmerize you to a degry of greatness.Still,WILL SMITH certainly trows knockout acting punches and makes it worth viewing.Honours should also go to JON VOIGHT and the creator of the HOWARD COSSELL facial mask.

A common scene in LAS VEGAS for FRANK was seeing SAMMY CAHN and JIMMY VAN HEUSEN coming at him backstage.His comments often were:not them again.In fact,he was always happy to try out their new songs.As you know,FRANK SINATRA sang the whole repertoire of AMERICAN songs of the great composers and lyricists of his time.The big difference is that SAMMY CAHN often wrote his songs especially for FRANK.The two were linked together since 1942 when SINATRA insisted that SAMMY should write the songs for his current film.This collection is an excellent sample of their collaboration,and many like ALL THE WAY,COME FLY WITH ME,THE TENDER TRAP and HIGH HOPES will forever be associated with them.

These are the songs that the BRITISH INVASION groups played to death in the sixties;here's your chance to hear the originals in this wonderful collection.In fact to be frank,this can be the only blues record you ever need when your friends want to hear that kind of music.Just for the record ,let's enumerate which songs were recorded by the likes of THE ROLLING STONES(I CAN'T BE SATISFIED,I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU,MANNISH BOY);CREAM(ROLLIN AND TUMBLIN,I'M READY)and THEM(BABY PLEASE DON'T GO)and this is only a partial list.MUDDY WATERS was more than anybody else the best performer of the CHICAGO blues.If you like it, you can go with the follow up which completes this anthology perfectly.

I am not terribly fond of revenge pictures,however this film is really worth seeing for MITCHUM's character...who can't forget the lawyer who send him to jail eight years before.Composer BERNARD HERRMANN adds to the suspense with another good score.Having seen the remake with DENIRO ,which goes over the top,i recommend the original in black and white.Such a story is fun in a film,but in real life it is certainly hell.While watching it,say to yourself:i am so glad that this is only a movie.Just imagine being stuck with MITCHUM in your basement...

The title of this movie is adequate,you have to watch it with your eyes wide shut to appreciate it.I can't beleive that CRUISE and KIDMAN got involved in this mess.Slow moving,pretentious and boring to say the least.Who really cares about those dreams and the way the couples try to cope with their potential infidelities?The ending if you are patient enough to get there tops it;they must make love to redeem themselves.Oh yeah!One gets the feeling that with the death of the director during the filming,they simply could not find a way to find a coherence with the project.One of the sexless sex movie ever made.Think of it,maybe i missed the point.Forget it.If you get through this,you should receive a medal of tolerance.

Far from the usual corny vision of many war films of the time,TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH deserves it's reputation.You don't have here twelve bombings every fifteen minutes just to create action for action sake.What you have is a realistic war story dealing with men who risks their life and become obsessed with the fear of not coming back.GREGORY PECK gives a great performance,strong and also vulnerable in the end.Considering that this film was made in 1949,it's certainly a classic.If you love war films with a lot of action,a girl ornementation and a HOLLYWOOD vision,don't see this movie,it's simply beyond you.

Obviously made to redeem KEVIN COSTNER's career at the box office after a few failures,FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME is not half as good as was his previous baseball movies:BULL DURNHAM AND FIELD OF DREAMS.If you want to watch a good movie about baseball, you should view PRIDE OF THE YANKEES OR EIGHT MEN OUT.I hate the way the narrative switch here;this does not convince me at all.Everything turns around BILLY CHAPPEL's perfect game and his relation with a girl he met while playing on the road.There is something phoney about this film that turned me off.The fact that this was not a true baseball story did not help.I have a message for movie producers.How about a film on MARK FRIEDRICH who used to play for the TIGERS.This guy for those who remember,used to talk to his ball.

If you have to choose between this visual document and the biography released in november,don't hesitate to buy the video or dvd. Why? Because it's the facts that are featured here and not the gossips of which no word should be said at all. The daughters of Mr. RODGERS: LINDA and MARY talked about their father's complex personnality and say along the way that the music was more emotional than the man. The portrait of LORENZ HART is also interesting; Mr. RODGERS's patience with LORENZ shows the compassion of a man who knew the value of a partnership. Personnaly, because I am a huge RODGERS and HART fan, I really liked this segment a lot. Those were the days of the AMERICA we like best, between the two world wars. So many of AMERICA's greatest achievement in music happened during those years. 90 minutes of RICHARD RODGERS who was the greatest composer of his time is certainly worthy of your time. This visual biography was first shown on PBS last autumn.

No,this is not DAVID BOWIE,who recorded a song of that title,but L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute;,one of FRANCE's enfant terrible de la chanson ,who had several faces over the years.This collection gives you a sample of his work.Four songs can be considered classics of his repertoire:PARIS CANAILLE,MONSIEUR WILLIAM,LE PONT MIRABEAU and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF.If there were a perfect song for him,it was MONSIEUR WILLIAM,the story of a middle age man who suddently is caught in a tragic love affair;LE PONT MIRABEAU is a famous poem by APOLLINAIRE set to music;PARIS CANAILLE makes good use of a sort of FRENCH slang(argot)and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF is a four hundred years old writing(i am not kidding).A good buy to get acquinted with L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute;.You can go deeper after that.

This tv serie is one of three DEPARDIEU played in .It is not easy to deal with such a towering figure like BALZAC.Although it was a valiant try to summarize some highlights of his life,the serie only partially succeeds to interest viewers.My favorite segment is the one with the RUSSIAN comptess who falls in love with HONOR&Eacute;.It really shows the importance that correspondance had in that century,especially when you deal with a writer,it really becomes essential.Like many great writers,BALZAC's greatness is not his personnal life but is all contained in his novels.The legendary aspects of BALZAC are there(LA CANNE AU POMMEAU D'OR,SA FAMEUSE CAFETIERE WHO KEPT HIM AWAKE DURING THE WEE HOURS etc.)If you want to buy one serie among the three,buy LES MIS&Eacute;RABLES, in which D&Eacute;PARDIEU is VALJEAN and MALKOVICH JAVERT.Overall,it is the best of the three.

For those of you wondering where i have been living in the past 25 years,it's the DEAN MARTIN's FAN CUB UNIT TRUCK.Now don't tell anybody i told you this.Getting down to business,youngsters always tell me that these songs perpetuated my conversion to mainstream pop songs.I see that RCA has done a good job by added a few tracks that were not there originally.I enjoyed doing O SOLO MIO(IT'S NOW OR NEVER),even if the copyright of this song did not belong to my country.Those songs are cheesy,but i still love them.By that time,i was fed up with rock'n'roll and i wanted to please the grandmothers who had always eluded me in the early years.

It's a common fact,ELVIS PRESLEY fans are spoiled,especially since RCA have made their golden records last longer.With this, the company can be sure that ELVIS will continue to sell for a long time.The added tracks here are not fillers,they really deserve to be there.This collection of songs range from gospel to the wonderful movie themes from VIVA LAS VEGAS and KISSIN'COUSINS to soft rock material that is quite fun to listen to and very typical of ELVIS at that time.At the time of the original release of that album 1968,ELVIS was considered finished and washed up;his films were often very ordinary,but the television comeback changed all that and gradually ELVIS managed to redeemed himself to the joy of all his fans.The added tracks makes this golden records collection just as essential as the previous three.

While preparing yourself to watch this delightful movie entertainment,just make sure there are no feminists in your house.It's actually the story of a gang of macho men who competes for the affection of CLAUDIA CARDINALE.Who could blame them?There are many explosions along the ride,so you should not fall asleep,except if your sister is a grey nun.The dialogue is often cynical in a true fun way.Like we often say,they don't make them like that anymore.That MEXICAN flavor that brings out the male in all of us.The first time i saw that movie in the seventies,i wished that CLAUDIA was my aunt,but it was only a dream.Entertainment is the key word here, and does it delivers?

The least we can say about FRED ASTAIRE is that he certainly didn't forget the musicals that he starred in on the stage.THE BAND WAGON like FUNNY FACE is a wonderful musical filled with great songs,brilliant choregraphies and this one includes a terrific gangster pastiche.One of those few films you can watch many times(take a few months in between).Some cynics may find it corny at times.Director MINNELLI had a strange way of directing;sometimes he had a tendacy to overdo it a little in the dialogue department.Still, there are so many delightful scenes in this movie,that you should overcome the few downers.Without a doubt,this is one of the best musical ever made.

Like many of you,i usually complain about the amont of greatest hits packaging of all of the artists in the recording industry;this was of course before i bought this remarkable collection that has all of the themes of the JAMES BOND movies ,including the bad ones like A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.For me, an old crackpot of 41,what holds my interest is still the first 5 adventures of 007.When SEAN CONNERY quit,i followed him,but you may say this is a cd not a movie.Right you are,my mistake.What i want to say, is that you've got you're money's worth here and that's guarantee.GOLDFINGER and THUNDERBALL are my favorites themes, but i also like FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and LIVE AND LET DIE.As i write this ,i hear someone coming in the house,god help me JAMES, because my wife came back earlier than i thought, and i suddently realized while watching THUNDERBALL that this stuff ain't for 2001 but 1965 ,when women couldn't care less about the macho attitudes of 007.Did i tell you that i actually hate JAMES BOND and that CLAUDINE AUGER still knocks me out in her swimsoot.

After 6 LPS with POLYDOR,RENAUD signed with VIRGIN and the first release became one of the biggest seller of his career.MISS MAGGIE became a hit and even had an ENGLISH version.The whole album is a catalogue of his familiar themes with a new maturity,probably because he became the father of a girl a few years before.For those who don't know this FRENCH folksinger and are allergic to greatest hits package,MISTRAL GAGNANT is the original cd to buy if you want only one.RENAUD's music is a cross between DYLAN and the MONTMARTRE populist songs of early twentieth century.

Originally,those were two separate LPS released in the late fifties and early sixties.While this is not BRASSENS'S best overall,there are enough good songs to make it worth buying.Highlights are the title track,LE VIEUX L&Eacute;ON,BONHOMME,PENELOPE and LE BISTROT.Included here is GEORGE'S only CHRISTMAS song LE PERE NOEL ET LA PETITE FILLE and also another one L'ORAGE ,who makes good use of an invention the paratonnerre by BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ,to collect a love affair.This is a typical device of BRASSENS,to establish something unusual;in french the word is insolite.Finally ,there is a song about his parents MAMAN,PAPA and a few poems put to music like PHILISTINS and LE VERGER DU ROI LOUIS.With him,PATACHOU(this is the woman who really discovered him)sings MAMAN,PAPA.In the liner notes,there is a picture of her.

Often compared to C&Eacute;LINE DION because she also tried to make it by singing in ENGLISH(where the big money is),LARA has returned to her natural FRENCH with this cd that delivers what her fans want to hear from her.Basically a voice that has a tendacy of overeaching itself;this is a trademark common to many divas of our time.NUE(there are some georgeous pictures of her in the booklet)is a well produced opus that gives you your money's worth.As it is often the case in today's music,the music comes on top of the lyrics that are cruelly lacking in deph.It's tough to highlight a song in particular,but her duo with MAURANE(her BELGIAN friend)really clicks.Is LARA FABIAN a great singer?You've got to judge by yourself.One thing is sure,she is clearly a product of our time.

I have read the FRENCH translation of this book,and i enjoyed it,even if the approach often is on the intellectual side.No AMERICAN art in the first half of the previous century gets near that man, who visualized his country with a personnal perception.The paintings of HOPPER often gets to you in their quest of lonelyness.PEOPLE IN THE SUN for instance is fascinating.The most interesting aspect about HOPPER,is that his paintings are about the persistance of vision;the way one can try to read his mind.

MORRISON had a few hits under his belt with his group THEM,but it is with ASTRAL WEEKS that he firmly established his reputation.The importance of this disc has been discussed often;MORRISON with his powerful voice put his stamp on the soul world dominated at the time by MOTOWN and STAX.His mystic approach is the key to the understanding of the creation of his style.From the delightful rythym and blues THE WAY YOUNG LOVERS DO to the epic scale MADAME GEORGE,here is a classic that has stand the test of time.An essential entry from the troubled sixties, that contribued to elargate the forms of pop music.Enough said,buy it and enjoy.

This is a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the first six LPS of the FRENCH singer.This collection is fine all the way;it's like a hard cover with a booklet filled with pictures and also an excellent overview of his career until 1983.The cd is at the end.When you listen to HEXAGONE(what a debut)the DYLAN of the early days come to mind.Like THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN,this song is also a virulent critic of FRANCE at the time(1975).In his early years,RENAUD's songs are often intented to wake you up to the society that you live in.LAISSE BETON and LES CHAROGNARDS for instance belong in that category.After that period associated with his youth,he will settle for a more subtle approach,but as you know the natural always comes back to the front.RENAUD is know a well known figure throughout the FRANCOPHONIE;the tenderness of the man has replaced the rebel that he once was.Two songs here:MARCHE A L'OMBRE and VIENS CHEZ MOI,J'HABITE CHEZ UNE COPINE were title songs for movies.

The first two tracks are reminiscent of ANNIE LENNOX and PRINCE,so much that you may ask yourself:is that really C&Eacute;LINE singing?Obviously,this disc is aim to please the most and probably will just do that.By now,C&Eacute;LINE has become an industry by herself.ONE HEART(a SHANIA TWAIN type of song) the title track is ideal for radio success.As a whole,i must admit that the cd is well produced,but is it enough to get us feel something when she sings in ENGLISH?I hope that JE T'AIME ENCORE is the prelude of an another disc with GOLDMAN in the near future.Let us pray the LORD(the manager)for a possible return of the diva singing in FRENCH.Maybe halfway through the LAS VEGAS shows?Aren't you tired of songs that always need to reach the top ten?After all,we've passed the age of driving all night.I am patient and i did not loose interest in C&Eacute;LINE yet.

When i was young,my grandparents had a dozen of TINO ROSSI's LP.TINO was one of the most popular singer of the thirties and forties.Later on,many tried to follow in his footsteps,but no one could equal the man with the honey voice.Composer VINCENT SCOTTO used to create some of his songs with him in mind and they were perfectly matched for one another.If you resist to the charm of romantic songs like TCHI TCHI,O CORSE ILE D'AMOUR and CHANSON POUR NINA(my favorite),you are probably dead.This is timeless stuff that still delivers after all these years

It was their first good album;a premise to the group's later conceptual albums.Most people are satisfied with 1 or 2 cds collection of this wonderful group.In fact,RAY DAVIES'S group deserves better;all the output from 1967 to 1972 is worth buying.I am asthonished by the way RAY DAVIES has been able to transcend the world of his youth by subliming it.Many songs here retain their special charm:DAVID WATTS,TWO SISTERS etc.Liner notes tell about the story behind the album.The added tracks are in general more than merely fillers.Belongs to any BRITISH INVASION library,even if THE KINKS were never really rockers.

There are many reasons why i consider this record to be COLTRANE'S best:in 1961 free jazz was still fresh and alive,bursting with talents like COLTRANE and DOLPHY;JOHN was obviously at his creative peak here;CHASIN'THE TRANE is an incredible music experience,summerizing all his experiments with his personal touch, and JOHN is helped on two tracks with the genius of DOLPHY who is the only one who can match him at this point of his musical adventures.Listen to this record carefully and learn why music like this won't come around anymore ,simply because it can't be teached,it comes from the soul.Here is a jazz record that defies the ages.

If i give this four stars,it's only because the pianists featured on this compilation are all excellent.It may be just my opinion,but to be franck,i don't really liked that record.There is nothing like hearing one pianist doing one collection of songs by a composer.Here we have to many at once,and the perspective gets lost.Hearing an intro of a SATIE song during IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND bothered me a lot.OK as they say,this is a package.Well that's the problem today,there are about three records out of four that are best of of anything.I'll sell this to an used music store and i'll eat my wieners to content myself.Tough luck,i had forgotten that even them come in stores sliced in packages.I hope that VERVE will rerelease OSCAR PETERSON's own tribute to RICHARD RODGERS.What are they waiting for?

While not as successfull as a whole as the previous TOUT POUR LA MUSIQUE(her best),D&Eacute;BRANCHE still has it's moments;the title track is a perfect opener ;CALYPSO keeps things goin'smoothly;HONG KONG STAR is about an actor who would like to play SHAKESPEARE;C&Eacute;ZANNE PEINT is of course about the famous painter who died a few weeks after being caught in the rain;that is the reason you hear rain sounds at the end.ANNIE of ANNIE DONNE is actually one of FRANCE's best friend;J'AI BESOIN DE VOUS is her tribute to her fans.Like we often say,this is a cd mainly for fans of the artist.

This live album will please all FRANCE GALL fans including yours truely;there is also a second cd which is the continuation of this one.This was her comeback after her husbands's death( MICHEL BERGER)the year before.Her musicians provide good backing for her.D&Eacute;BRANCHE is longer and funkier than the original recording.The musicians don't steal the show;they give her the chance to display her consid&eacute;rable charm.Many songs like LA MINUTE DE SILENCE and MADEMOISELLE CHANG were originally recorded by MICHEL BERGER.Most fans of FRANCE GALL remain faithful to her;we remember the teenager who used to charm us and the happily married couple she formed with MICHEL.FRANCE will always be the GALL from FRANCE.

There are several FRANCE GALL live sets available:TOUR DE FRANCE,BERCY,but this one remains special for her fans.The musicians who played with her at that time,were the best she ever had.FRANCE is obviously enjoying herself here in the ZENITH concert hall,one of the biggest in FRANCE.The pictures incuded in the booklet tells a lot about her state of mind in these precious moments in her life.Most of the album D&Eacute;BRANCHE being her current lp in 1984 is played on this set.FRANCE GALL is not what can be considered a great singer,but her feminine charm more than compensate.My favorite moment is the D&Eacute;BRANCHE version on the second cd in which her complicity with the musicians reach it's zenith.

STARMANIA is one of the few classics among the FRENCH musicals.Many versions with different singers are available,but this is the original with GALL,DUFRESNE,THIBEAULT and BELAVOINE.The future versions of the show will be more flamboyant and theatrical.The first collaboration between LUC PLAMONDON the lyric writer from QU&Eacute;BEC and MICHEL BERGER still hits home ,with it's futurist theme of the tel&eacute;&eacute;vangelists invading our lives and the need to breath in non polluted environnement.Many singers from QU&Eacute;BEC have started their careers with the revivals of this show.The songs are so well known in QU&Eacute;BEC, that most of us know them by heart,which i think tells a lot about it's non stop success over the years.

The jewel in the REPRISE collection,SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS is my personal favorite album FRANK made with arranger GORDON JENKINS.No fillers here,and FRANK sings in a most effective way through the lush backing of the orchestra.The concept is done very tastefully.JENKINS was the man who arranged two of NAT KING COLE's most fondly remembered records.NANCY SINATRA once said that she had a hard time listening to these songs because it made her think that her father would not remain with them forever.Never again FRANK will redo such a perfect product like that one,matching his greatest achievements with CAPITOL.It is as beautiful as it is sad,and it reach us deeply in it's honesty.If you like FRANK SINATRA,you simply have to buy that one that deserves to be ranked among his top 5.

Several of the songs included in that collection are also available elsewhere.The problem is when you are looking for certain renditions,you are forced to buy some of those that you can't find in other packages.Such is the problem that encounters a music maniac is the question:should i buy that one?Is it worth it?In our time,there are what i call a great nostalgia market that some companies share with the collectors.I'M IN LOVE AGAIN is perhaps the earliest version of a PORTER song;LET'S DO IT,LET'S FALL IN LOVE is interesting to compare with the RUDY VALEE version;I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU is the original of 1934 and so is FRED ASTAIRE's NIGHT AND DAY.My personal favorites are WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE(also available in the BUT IN THE MORNING NO(NAXOS NOSTALGIA) and YOU'D BE SO NICE TO COME HOME TO sung by the wonderful DINAH SHORE.

Youngsters will complain:i prefer the BEATLES or The ROLLING STONES versions and even the BEACH BOYS who aped him with SURFIN USA will always have the edge over the originals.Still a rock collection is not complete with at least the first two cds of this box.Those two cds are the heart and soul of a music we used to call rock.So many artists have been influenced by CHUCK BERRY,the list is endless from DYLAN to SPRINGSTEEN;he was the best lyric writer of the fifties.In fact,he made us aware that rock songs had lyrics to go alongside the guitar riffs.With that box,you get the original feeling of these songs as they were sung before the BRITISH INVASION sharpened them for their own good.(...)

If you don't know THE ROLLING STONES at all,buy it without fear of being disappointed.As a reminder for the old fans like me and many others,the first disc was already available on the HOT ROCKS collection thirty years ago.All of those songs are so well known by now,we could sing them accapella.The second cd is for me much more interesting,featuring songs from SOME GIRLS and STEEL WHEELS,their two best post EXILE albums but also from lesser albums that features a few good songs each.The importance of this collection is that you get your money's worth.But it should not prevent you from buying the best ROLLING STONES albums:BEGGAR'S BANQUET,LET IT BLEED,STICKY FINGERS,EXILE ON MAIN STEET,SOME GIRLS and STEEL WHEELS.I guess THE GLIMMER TWINS would be proud of my selection of their great cds,but one never knows.After all,the MICK JAGGER you saw in PHILADELPHIA or NEW YORK recently could be a stand in.Buy this.

MOUSTAKI started writing songs in the fifties for EDITH PIAF and then for SERGE REGGIANI and a few others.He had to wait in 1969 with LE M&Eacute;TEQUE to score on his own as a singer.Patience as they say is the key word for that man born in EGYPT who came to FRANCE when he was a young man of 18.This collection of four cds is a complete overview of his works.Each one can be bought seperately or in one box set.RACINES ET ERRANCES contains classics like ALEXANDRIE and LE M&Eacute;TEQUE and other carefully selection of his works.MOUSTAKI's voice is always soft and sensitive.The man is obviously un apotre de la paix(excuse my french).I am particularly fond of ELOGE DE LA PARESSE being a celebration of lazyness.Maybe a few of you out there will find this singer a little boring and repetitive if you don't speak FRENCH.What you should do is find yourself a girlfriend who speaks the language and the miracle will happen as she explains to you the meanings of the songs.Love and music is always the perfect match.

One of the most repulsive opening scenes in recent memory.Even a great director like SPIELBERG can reach a low point sometimes.It's hard to imagine why STEVEN has chosen such a subject among all the projects he enconters.It's like a guy experimenting cocaine for the first time;he doesn't remember where he is or where is coming from.I at least enjoyed ANTHONY HOPKINS'S performance as ADAMS,but those boring courtroom scenes really made me look at my watch more than twice.This is a misfire to say the least.Avoid this film and don't make the mistake of buying it.This is a DVD for masochists only.

The 1960 FRENCH movie with ALAIN DELON was perhaps not perfect,but it had a great atmospheric feeling to it.This remake simply doesn't ring true ,with MATT DAMON miscast as RIPLEY.The homosexual overtones in PATRICIA HIGHSMITH's novels were often disturbing in her time.The ITALIAN locations are obviously nice to look at,but can carry a movie by itself.Don't waste your precious time watching this pretentious movie.If you want to hear MY FUNNY VALENTINE,buy FRANK SINATRA's SONGS FOR YOUNG LOVERS-SWING EASY.When are they going to stop making those unnecessary remakes that HOLLYWOOD is so fond of between more important projects?

By carefully avoiding his most risqu&eacute; music( ASCENSION,EXPRESSION)of the very last years,this collection is the perfect start for the future discovery by new listeners of the great legacy that COLTRANE left to us.By featuring three numbers from GIANT STEPS,the compiler choose right,since that was the time that COLTRANE started to record his own stuff.Experiences with MILES and MONK,both rewarding,were now behind him.This cd might have been titled THE FEW STEPS TOWARD FREE JAZZ.MY FAVORITE THINGS and SUMMERTIME demonstrate the full range of what critics of the time called his torrent of notes becomming an avalanche.What you have here,is simply 75 minutes of pure jazz.Liner notes written by someone who knew him, tells a lot about the man.

Although DYLAN ,like all true legends is well treated nowadays in greatest hits packages,some of his records are still worth buying.ANOTHER SIDE is simply DYLAN reaching his early peak ,before his electric conversion;it is with this record that you can mesure his influence on so many artists that will come after him.It was not common at that time 1964 for a record with such a running time.You will notice here how he writes his songs;he often uses the roots of AMERICAN music:blues,ballad etc,but his originality is that he is able to transform them and make them work on a personnal level.This is one essential record of the sixties that you should have in your collection.Your only excuse is BOB's nasal voice,which has always been a matter of taste.

The voice had lost a little over the years,but this happens to every singer as he advance in life.This first official live recording remains nevertheless a priceless document well worth buying.Frank is obviously having a good time with the orchestra;you'll have fun hearing his monologue on his humble beginnings which he concludes by making fun at himself.Now isn't that the SINATRA we all like?At that time,FRANK had recorded his last great record THE SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS the year before.It's like witnessing the end of an era in which he was considered the king.Several excellent singles will follow this of course,but somehow this can fit as the end to the story.Several live sets have appeared on the market in recent years(1957 in CHICAGO,1959 in AUSTRALIA,LIVE IN PARIS etc)but if FRANK's voice was better in 1957 when he was recording his great concepts albums,none of them can top this one made in the town he helped to build.If you love SINATRA,you simply have to include this set in your collection.If i didn't talk about the songs,it's because they are so much a part of our cultural h&eacute;ritage now, that it doesn't seem necessary.But as you may say,there are young people reading this,and they don't know FRANK like you and me.Well,it is never too late,is it?

When i was young, PERRY COMO was the singer i used to laugh about.Now that i am 40, i just can't live without him;funny how we change as years go by.This is the perfect COMO cd, complete with good liner notes and the songs we all remember including those novelty songs that our mothers used to sing.Notice how I'M GONNA LOVE THAT GIRL ressembles SINATRA's first version of SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE LONELYEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK with COLUMBIA, as though the conductor was aping ALEX STORDHALL.PERRY COMO deserves his place among the good singers of his time.

Like CAROLINE OTERO,MISIA SERT and a few others,ALMA MAHLER came to symbolize the emerging power of women in the arts,at least in terms of the influence they had over their famous husbands.What FRANCOISE GIROUD tried to establish with that book,is that GUSTAV MAHLER gradually destroyed his wife's personnality.We've come a long way since then,but back then,it was almost impossible for a woman to made a name for herself ,even if she had a strong personnality.It was simply put a man's world,and FRANCOISE GIROUD in a true feminist way has found herself a good subject with the love affair between the composer and ALMA.I enjoyed reading this a lot.It's actually not a so called biography,more an essay about love and the way it can alter your life.

Adaptation of CLIFFORD ODETS'S play gives the chance to BING to tries his hand at a dramatic role for a change.Like most adaptations of stage plays at the time,it is stagebound but nevertheless fun to watch.Oscars should have been given to the make-up man who made our beloved GRACIE look older.Like most stories dealing with alcoolism,the man is weak and his wife takes charges of everything.The wife also tends to mother the husband unintentionaly in these situations.BING surprized his long time fans by playing this part that was so far of his ROAD movies with BOB HOPE.My favorite scene in this movie occurs when GRACIE slaps HOLDEN after a dramatic confrontation over her influence on her husband.This is what i call a typical m&eacute;lodramatic scene in a fifties movie.I think that most people should agree with that statement.

As DEPUIS LE JOUR demonstrates,COTUBRAS was perhaps the best incarnation of LOUISE in our time.In this cd of highlights ,the singer displays her talent with arias from MOZART,VERDI,PUCCINI and a good part of the cd is devoted to DONIZETTI's L'&Eacute;LISIR D'AMOUR.Most of these arias are well known to opera lovers,because they have been showcase for many sopranos singers over the years.I think that such a cd is a good start for those who want to listen to arias without buying complete operas.A complete recording of an opera is always hard to digest for non initi&eacute;s.This usually comes a little later,when you have experience that kind of music live.ILEANA COTRUBAS has played many famous h&eacute;roines on the stage

I reviewed that book a few years ago,but i feel i could give a better review of it now.Let me be objective here by saying that RICHARD RODGERS was the best AMERICAN composer of the previous century.This book of memoirs gives you a real insight of the music business at the time of mister RODGERS.The anecdotes are very accurate;they show the good and the bad aspects of the music business.RICHARD RODGERS learned early in his career that you are always as good as your last success,and that producers are the kings of BROADWAY.The best example of this is that even with all the hits he had,RICHARD RODGERS never could give ALLEGRO a second chance on BROADWAY.A show that failed is almost never revived again.The man has a lot to say about creativity;the way one must always stand tall even in adversity.One of the most moving passage of the book is the retreat of LORENZ HART and his death at the age of 47.RODGERS certainly knew the value of a partnership.That he could work with both HART and HAMMERSTEIN demonstrates how good he was.Nobody in the history of AMERICAN music has done it better.Out of the 40 shows that he created,10 have become classics of the repertoire.That's quite a feat.If RODGERS was the best,it's simply because he was the most passionnate and the most talented;a perfect combinaison.In my book,there will never be enough revivals of his shows.Buy this,you'll become a fan too,this is guarantee for a lifetime of musical pleasures.

Like KISS ME KATE and SOUTH PACIFIC, the original recording of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN has great historical value since ETHEL MERMAN was so much identified with the character.The songs are a sort of testament of the talents of IRVING BERLIN who had been active in AMERICAN music ever since 1907.BERLIN knew how to transcend simplicity like very few.That self made man helped with JEROME KERN build AMERICAN music.Here's a show that all the family can enjoy;it has sass,comedy and generally good fun.A classic show never gets out of date.Indeed, there is no business like showbusiness,just beware of that guy BUFFALO BILL and watch out for those INDIANS.

There are many instumental cds devoted to the music of PORTER.This one features the usual classic songs that are universally known.While good and fun to listen to,this one doesn't have the distinguished appeal of STEPHANE GRAPPELLI's almost perfect tribute or OSCAR PETERSON's short but very adventurous one.These are jazz renditions that mostly stay with the tunes.Especially worth buying if you are a PORTER collector.

ALEC WILDER himself a composer has written what is generally considered the bible of AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC.More than thirty years have gone by since the first &eacute;dition of this book and it remains fresh.Like many i am proud to say that this book was really for me what i needed to start digging into the history of many songs before the rock era.From BERLIN and KERN to the often forgotten greats like DONALDSON and McHUGH they are all there and mister WILDER knows what he is talking about;he had talked to many writers and composers who were at the time of the first &eacute;dition still with us.Personal opinions are of course a matter of taste;we are for example not obliged to believe everything he says.Most of the time mister WILDER is right:EXAMPLE:he believes that RICHARD RODGERS was perhaps the most gifted composer of his time.Few can really disagree with that.In fact,there is only one major problem with this book,if you don't read music it won't be too enjoyable for you,because there are many examples with sheet music to proves the points he wants to make.Everyone who has an interest in the history of AMERICAN popular music should buy that book.

Maybe you don't need this concept album in your collection.The problem with LOUIS is that his discography is so full of treasures,that one is almost forced to settle for those budget priced packages that often mix everything.By buying those,you are bound to reduce a musical genius to bits.Let me try to sell this one for you by saying that the concept of angels is very tastefully done,even if the songs are not all great.The choir adds to the fun,and during THE PRISONER'S SONG,LOUIS actually ask someone why this particular song got there.Remember this,there was only one SATCHMO and there are still out there tons of imitators.If LOUIS had actually married an angel,think of what the world had missed.

After many years as an actor on the stage and in the movies,JACQUES CANETTI persuaded REGGIANI to record an album of songs written by BORIS VIAN.This was in the midsixties.Since then,he has alterned between movies and music.REGGIANI has been for many years an admirer of FRENCH poets like VERLAINE and APOLLINAIRE.In this collection,complete with a booklet and overview of his career you get a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his output.My favorites are LE PONT MIRABEAU(also recorded by L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute;);he has chosen to recite the famous poem with a simple piano accompagnment and it's marvelous.My other favorites are the songs written for him by GEORGES MOUSTAKI(GASPARD,SARAH);the famous D&Eacute;SERTEUR from VIAN and also his biggest hit:IL SUFFIRAIT DE PRESQUE RIEN.The rest is less interesting,but as you know,it's always difficult to get the perfect single cd of a singer.It makes me laugh when they say ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED,because this isn't an original at all but a greatest hits package.AMAZON do your work correctly.

In his lifetime,BOURVIL recorded more than 200 songs.Novelty comic songs,operetta(PHI PHI,L'AUBERGE DU CHEVAL BLANC,LA ROUTE FLEURIE) and even sentimental songs.Yet, with all the talents he had,he is mostly remembered for his movie comedies with LOUIS DE FUNES(LE CORNIAUD,LA GRANDE VADROUILLE).He deserved to be remembered for more than just that.This collection is far from complete(no operetta stuff),but many of his most popular songs are there.The parody of GAINSBOURG'S JE T'AIME MOI NON PLUS is hilarious.Among the missing delights are FREDO LE PORTEUR(a moving monologue)and BONJOUR,MONSIEUR LE MAITRE D'&Eacute;COLE.Both should have been included in that collection.

Parts of this historical recording are very interesting because they show the emergence of a creator on the edge of future greatness.Three cuts really stand out:BETTER GIT IT IN YOUR SOUL,GOODBYE PORK PIE HAT and FABLES OF FAUBUS.Each of these tracks demonstrates that MINGUS is willing to strech out his talent in a variety of styles.The rest of the stuff is quite uneven and the bonus tracks are not that great.As it is,this cd is definetetly worth buying for jazz fans.Don't expect a masterpiece like ROUND MIDNIGHT (DAVIS) or IMPRESSIONS(COLTRANE) and you'll get satisfaction.

WESLA's voice is a matter of taste, but one can not say that great care was not taken into making this record a good product.Being a huge RODGERS and HART fan i suggest that you listen to this record at least twice before judging it.The problem here is that there is so many good recordings of their songs available that it is hard for new singers to enter the carousel with ELLA,SARAH,ANITA(i can't find that one)and of course FRANK and TONY.My favorites here are the lesser known YOU ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL and HE WAS TOO GOOD TO ME songs that were not recorded too often in the past.A great care has been put on the lyrics here, but it's normal since LARRY HART was the best lyric writer of his time.I miss the orchestral arrangments with songs like I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS.In conclusion, i suggest to the reviewer of TEXAS to get out of his state once in a while, it might enlarge his critical wit.

Not as priceless as ROUND MIDNIGHT,MILESTONES is a crossover of things to come for MILES.It is a prime example of hard bop jazz,the way it was played in 1958.DR.JACKYL and SID'S AHEAD are the key numbers here ,allowing all the musicians to shine on their instruments.Alternate versions (STRAIGHT NO CHASER,MILESTONES and especially TWO BASS HIT were unnecessary).They are there to make the record last longer.TRIVIAL QUIZ:who says ALL RIGHT at the end of the second version of STRAIGHT NO CHASER?Who hits harder JO JONES or MAX ROACH?Wifes of the late musicians could tell us.

I first bought this album twenty years ago on vinyl.This was my introduction to MILES DAVIS, and naturally i was hooked on this version of ROUND MIDNIGHT.The beginning of a great collaboration of two musicians is always fascinating in retrospect.With added tracks on this cd edition ,this might be MILES's best ever(now don't jump on the ceiling).The muted DAVIS and the lyrical COLTRANE completes eachother like very few in the history of jazz.I would even suggest to you that you should buy this instead of the single cd highlighting the works of MILES and COLTRANE.This is a much more satisfying experience.Easily one of the best jazz cd one can buy,even the sleeve is a work of art.

One of the most popular singers in BELLE &Eacute;POQUE era,FRAGSON actually became popular in FRANCE and in ENGLAND singing in both languages,a rare feat at the time.This was a time when the voice of the singers were recorded without the microphone.Those recordings are of particular interest,if you have a passion for that era.That kind of singing of course became old hat after world war 1 ,when new stars like MAURICE CHEVALIER and MISTINGUETT emerged.Along with his contempories POLIN,DRANEM and MAYOL,FRAGSON came to symbolize his time very well.Like MARVIN GAYE,FRAGSON'S life ended tragically at age 44, when his father shot him because he thought his son wanted to send him to an old age house.The last songs in the collection are in ENGLISH.For today's crowd,they sound perhaps unintentionnaly funny.It is interesting to note that many of FRAGSON'S songs are ironic and mysogyne(excuse my french).L'AMOUR BOITEUX,JE CONNAIS UNE BLONDE and SI TU VEUX MARGUERITE were big hits.

CORNEVILLE is a FRENCH town in NORMANDY.The people in CORNEVILLE know about that operetta just like the people in OKLAHOMA know about the famous musical.The libretto uses FRENCH dialect(the equivalent of AMERICAN slang) which was rather unusual at the time 1877.A very popular work of the genre,achieving a thousand representations over a ten year period.It is still being presented today, and has retained the particular charm it always had.MADY MESPL&Eacute; ,the queen of FRENCH operettas revivals in the sixties and seventies plays GERMAINE.MADY has retired from the stage and is now a singing teacher who gives master classes.This recording was made in 1973.The part of HENRI DE CORNEVILLE was a favorite of famed FRENCH singer MICHEL DENS who played it many times on the stage.So now,everybody knows that NORMANDY is not only famous for the war debarquement.You can actually hear the bells a few times during the recording.

Created in 1872,LA FILLE DE MADAME ANGOT is part of the classic FRENCH operetta repertoire.It's hard to understand why when you listen to these two cds.The plot is so predictable and has many reminicences of OFFENBACH.The problem with it,is that it's unfit to please today's crowd.It really belongs to it's time.JADIS LES ROIS is the song often used in operettas anthologys.Act 1 has good ensemble work from the cast and the best numbers are there.I at least enjoyed the instrumental pieces that are in act 3,but the rest is hard to digest.After listening to this work many times,i started to enjoy it more.I learned a lesson here.Never judge after at least two listenings.Sorry mister LECOCQ,i won't make that mistake again.

Created in 1898,VERONIQUE has remained MESSAGER's greatest international success in the field of operetta.It was seen in VIENNA in 1900,in LONDON in 1903 and even at the APOLLO theatre in 1904(495 performances).DUO DE L'ESCARPOLETTE and DECI-DELA are famous songs recorded seperately by singers like YVONNE PRINTEMPS and a few others.There is also an ENGLISH version available on cd.It's good to know that a charming work like VERONIQUE can live on over the years.This recording made in 1969 is excellent.At my humble point of view,if you don't enjoy this delightful operetta,it simply means that you are allergic to the genre.Try it,you may like it because that allergy is contagious.Am i being ironic or what?

OFFENBACH's most famous operetta has had a few recordings in recent years:one with FELICITY LOTT and another with JESSYE NORMAN.This one made in 1970 with DANIELE MILLET as HELENE is offered at a good price and is just as good.It also has the merit of having a complete FRENCH cast.It's nearly impossible to get bored with OFFENBACH,unless of course your knowing of the FRENCH language is limited.HELENE the goddess will elevates your senses by making you fall for her beauty.Like most men,i love goddesses;how about you?

One of the last among the FRENCH operetta revivals of the sixties and seventies that were all recorded.Even if it's considered a classic of the genre,there was always a problem with the libretto of this work.LES MOUSQUETAIRES AU COUVENT is always on the verge of naughtiness,but somehow manages to escape from it.This 1979 version of the work reunites two great FRENCH singers:MADY MESPL&Eacute; and MICH&Egrave;LE COMMAND.It's hard to imagine an ordinary recording with those two.There are a few good numbers of course like JE SUIS L'ABB&Eacute; BRIDAINE and POUR FAIRE UN BRAVE MOUSQUETAIRE,but the dialogue gets tiresome after a while.It is interesting to notice that in LE MEILLEUR DE L'OP&Eacute;RETTE, a two cds anthology,they choose the older recording of the work which i think tells a lot about the consideration they have for this one.I have a simple theory on why this operetta is still popular today:it's an old male fantasy to get stuck in a nun's place and find there are beautiful nuns waiting for them.

If you are an operetta freak,i won't have to sell to you this work because you should know it.It is the most famous work of the genre along with LA VIE PARISIENNE.It is also hard to tell which recording is the best available;it depends naturally of the language you are most familiar with.The originality of LA VEUVE JOYEUSE among other things is that there is no real overture at the beginning and it also makes fun of adultry in many ways.Like so many masterpieces like PORGY AND BESS,it had an uneasy early career until it's success became contagious worldwide.More than many work of the genre,the dialogue is used like in a real play and is not there only to fill the time between the songs.Finally,LA VEUVE JOYEUSE symbolize the belle &eacute;poque era perfectly;it's a tribute to a time when AUSTRIA was the center of the cultural life.Who can resist L'HEURE EXQUISE?It's so romantic.This recording was made in 1967,and was the first of many revivals of the classics operettas in FRANCE that were all recorded.

This 1959 recording is not bad at all,but the two more recent versions have surpassed it.The dialogue will put off many listeners.This OFFENBACH operetta is among the six that are still being performed today.It has many delicious moments like the songs LE CONQU&Eacute;RANT DIT A LA JEUNE INDIENNE,O MON CHER AMANT and AH!QUEL DINER ,all often present in operetta anthologies.For all of those who don't know OFFENBACH,the best way to start is with THE WORLD OF OFFENBACH,a single cd that offers overtures and songs.

One of my all time favorites;i actually saw it for the first time as a kid and i remembered that i could not wait for MONTY to let SHELLEY WINTERS drawn in her canoe.For me ELISABETH and MONTY were a perfect romantic match.Their scenes together are beautiful to watch.It was also one of the first film i saw that made me realize the importance of movie editing.ELISABETH and MONTY made two other films together:RAINTREE COUNTY and SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER ,but none of these can equal A PLACE IN THE SUN.I know many people thinks this melodrama is a bit too much to swallow ,but ignore them ,because here is a true AMERICAN classic.

Also available in a 2LPS on 1 cd along with DANNY BOY(ANDY's first LP with COLUMBIA)MOONRIVER is simply an offer that ANDY WILLIAMS fans can resist.If you forget MARIA(never a favorite of mine),this comes close as being a perfect LP.All of these songs are perfectly suited for his voice that can be compared to a melting hot chocolate stimulating your mouth after an afternoon of skying with friends.One of the most satisfying aspect in the decline of rock,is that singer with the talent of ANDY get the chance to belt it out all over again.This will make you want to hear more from him...

This is a fine ballad offering from mister BENNETT.You can't go wrong with this one.Highlights are MAYBE SEPTEMBER and THE PAWNBROKER,both perfectly fit for his voice,but the album is a winner all the way.Many of the songs here:EMILY,SHADOW OF YOUR SMILE,SECOND TIME AROUND and DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES were also covered by ANDY WILLIAMS at about the same time.GIRL TALK can be considered a funny pre-feminist song and THE TROLLEY SONG will always be associated with JUDY GARLAND.Your only reason not to buy this is that if you are allergic to ballads.Ideal to relax after a hard day.

My grandmother often talked to me about JEAN SABLON because she had attented one of his concert in MONTR&Eacute;AL.JEAN was always considered the FRENCH BING CROSBY.Like BING, he had an easy way of singing that seemed effortless.It was a revolution at the time when JEAN used the microphone for the first time.Naturally after him,every singer did it.This double cd is the perfect tribute to the singer who was mostly popular with women.Included here are his versions of two COLE PORTER songs:MISS OTIS REGRETS and BEGIN THE BEGUINE.In fact after the second world war,SABLON was also popular in your country ,probably because the man had class.Listening to JEAN nowadays has become a special nostalgic pleasure, since the world he celebrated with his songs no longer exists.Well it seems that my grandmother had good taste.Didn't she?

MAURICE CHEVALIER was the first FRENCHMAN to really make it in HOLLYWOOD when the pictures started to talk.He was a great entertainer even if his singing was far from great.It is hard for youngsters today to imagine why this guy was so popular and came to symbolize FRANCE throughout the world.Perhaps you'll be surprized to learn that as joyful as he looked, MAURICE once had a nervous breakdown after he played with DRANEM in the op&eacute;rette LA-HAUT.After that,he never went down again.This double collection gives you his best songs and only a few fillers in the first disc;you'll also hear in a few songs his wife YVONNE VALL&Eacute;E.MAURICE had actually met her during his breakdown and their relation will end after a few years.He had actually learned ENGLISH during the first war while being a prisonner, and he was saved by MISTINGUETT who had relations to get him out.He played with her in many revues ,and then went out on his own and like they say the rest is history.

A sample of the divine one singing the ballads.While there are now many good collections of SARAH on the market,this one focus on ballads.New superlatives are always difficult to find to describe her marvellous voice.Everything is a highlight here;it's an hour of magic perfect for romantic couples who want to relax while playing the games of love.Trying to find a better SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES is impossible.When SARAH takes an hold of a particular song she likes,other singers are often left speechless.SARAH was simply put-here i go with superlatives again-the greatest female singer of her time.

The whole book is devoted to the second world war,every aspect of it(a turn off for many women).The shadows of HITLER and STALINE are of course omnipresent.So are the unavoidable horror of the concentration camps.The stories of HENRI LAFONT and JEAN MOULIN which deals with the FRENCH r&eacute;sistance;the retreat of MUSSOLLINI after being turned over by his government;the incredible saga of PETIOT who kills people and leaves no evidence.You've got to read this to beleive it.Like the preceeding two,this is still essential reading about a time of terror in the history of the previous century.

The second book of the series focuses mainly on the emerging power of the regimes totalitaires in GERMANY,ITALY,SPAIN and RUSSIA during the thirties.The terrible massacre of GUERNICA;HITLER destroying the SA to clear the place for his SS;the way he also eliminates DOLLFUSS the AUSTRIAN chancelier;the crimes of STALINE who kills his own collaborators to clear his conscience.All those stories are unfortunately true and were part of the previous century.ALAIN DECAUX scored again with this history book that also features STAVISKY the FRENCH crook,ALEXANDRE 1 the YOUGOSLAVIAN king and TROTSKI the RUSSIAN opponent of STALINE.Essential reading.

I have read the first book of the series,and it's great from the beginning until the end.ALAIN DECAUX is a marvellous historian who can make you an addict of his numerous books dealing with history.On this series,he has chosen to dig from stories who made the previous century.These particular stories were at the front of our everyday life at the time.Once you lay your hands on this book you'll be hooked,beleive me.When it was possible,DECAUX met surviving witness of these stories to verify the facts in a true historical round up.BL&Eacute;RIOT the pioneer of aviation;LANDRU the archetype of the serial killer of women who leaves no evidence of his murders;the incredible story of VINCENT MOULIA during the first world war and his late r&eacute;habilitation by the FRENCH authorities ;LINDBERG who of course needs no pr&eacute;sentation etc.If ALAIN DECAUX is not able to sustain an interest in history matters that are about true people who accomplished great feats in their lives,then nobody will.Remember the famous saying:le pass&eacute; est garant de l'avenir.The series is also available in one book that reunites all the separate parts.

Among the highlights of this second PORTER nostalgic cd in the NAXOS collection are the original renditions of many songs like THE PHYSICIAN and MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY that will please any PORTER fan in this world.Even more so than in LET'S MISBEHAVE,the first disc that had also many precious stuff,including some singing by COLE himself,this one is better as a whole.There is absolutely not a false note here.Sometimes ,nostalgia can really get to you in a deep moving away.

This collection reunites many great names of the FRENCH music scene.The originality here is that they all include a superb booklet full of pictures of the artists over the years.Is this the best among the greatest hits cds devoted to JULIETTE GR&Eacute;CO?No it isn't,even if it's not bad at all.My objection relies on the fact that they forgot two of JULIETTE's vintage albums:one devoted to PIERRE MacORLAN and the other to MAURICE FANON.The selection includes songs of TRENET,B&Eacute;ART(the father of the actress),BREL and a few others.It is hard to resume JULIETTE with a single cd,considering that she recorded songs of so many writers and composers,included herself during a career that started more than fifty years ago.If you buy this,you'll find out that it's just like opening a book.

Not all together as successful as was DEUX the first opus of C&Eacute;LINE and GOLDMAN,S'IL SUFFISAIT D'AIMER nevertheless won't disapoint C&Eacute;LINE's true fans.There are excellent songs like the title track obviously intented as a hit and also EN ATTENDANT SES PAS(i like this kind of song from her)and DANS UN AUTRE MONDE a good rhythm song.That's the best part of the cd.Now going to the negative side,i must say that i don't like JE CHANTERAI and it's gospel touch unsuited for C&Eacute;LINE.I can say the same thing about TERRE,a soul song that simply don't work.C&Eacute;LINE's fans have the last word,and as a whole they should enjoy it.Let me just say as a conclusion,that a third opus would certainly be of interest.

I have part 3 of these recordings,which really represents PIAF at her early best.Nowadays,eversince she became a legend,we tend to forget that the SPARROW(it took an AMERICAN to found such a nickname)had precursors in the names of DAMIA and FREHEL.What distinguish EDITH,is the fact that she encouraged many talents like MONTAND,AZNAVOUR and B&Eacute;CAUD then at their beginnings.I have 4 favorites in this collection,there are C'EST LUI QUE MON COEUR A CHOISI,MON L&Eacute;GIONNAIRE(also recorded by GAINSBOURG),LES MOMES DE LA CLOCHE(in the style of FREHEL)and ENTRE SAINT OUEN ET CLIGNANCOURT.At this early stage of her career,PIAF is already the incredible man eater that his now linked with her legend;the sparrow has quietly left her cage...

It's never easy to make a record of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN songs,because the shows are so linked in our memory.As it is often said that the RODGERS AND HART songs are better suited for individual singers(there is some truth to that theory)Apart from THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A DAME which goes over the top and YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE where the feeling gets lost,i enjoyed this record.My favorite here is IF I LOVED YOU which prooves that BERNADETTE can really sing.Cynics will tell you that this cd was made just because it is the 100th anniversary of RICHARD RODGERS'S birth.I don't intend to make you beleive that this is a recording you should absolutely buy,but it's a well come addition in the RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN canon.

This scrapbook is a real treat to any true SINATRA fan.It is full of pictures of everybody who was important in his life from his parents to collaborators like arrangers NELSON RIDDLE; all his wifes from NANCY to BARBARA;the legendary LOUIS B. MAYER etc.Better than most biographies because it is based on facts not rumours.The early pictures from his beginnings are alone worth the price.I was fortunate enough to get this book at the third of it's price and i went through it very fast because once you open it, you simply can't take your hands out of it.If FRANK became the singer of the past century, it's not by accident, he worked hard at it.I was particulary touched by his loyalty to his true friends.FRANK SINATRA is a mirror of his country. He was the son of immigrants who lived the AMERICAN dream to the fullest.Where is the AMERICAN dream today now that it's last legend is gone?Let's not complain too much ,because everything that FRANK SINATRA ever recorded is now available on cd.Nostalgia when you think of it is a very good thing.SATURDAY is not the loneliest night of the week anymore thanks to the chairman of the board.If you are not already a fan, this book should do the trick.

Maybe for today's crowd,four cds of BILLIE HOLIDAY in her greatest years can be hard to digest.Don't feel sorry for yourself,because sooner or later,if you have any interest in jazz singing,this PROPER box set will do the trick.Don't listen to this only once,repeating listenings are recommended to have you hooked on BILLIE.The musicians who played on these famous sessions are among the finest of the era.Even if you don't look at the credits,one can easily know when LESTER YOUNG is soloing,his economical solos always hit home.Be aware that this is the thirties and the forties, when conductors were not stars the way they will be in the fifties.Many will find that all the songs sounds the same.While there is some truth to that,you've got to figure out the contect of these recordings to fully appreciate them.Maybe i seem to act like an history teacher reviewing this,if so i am sorry.BILLIE HOLIDAY has inspired countless singers that came after her who often recorded tribute albums.

Three duets out of the many that MARVIN recorded during the sixties is not much,but you can not get everything in one cd.Personally,i would have removed AIN'T THAT PECULIAR and IF I COULD BUILD MY WHOLE WORLD AROUND YOU and replaced them with CAN I GET A WITNESS and PRETTY LITTLE BABY,but again it's only my opinion.As it is,most people should get satisfaction with that product,although those songs were allready in the ANTHOLOGY years ago.

One of the pioneers of the electric guitar,T-BONE WALKER was a prime inspiration for CHUCK BERRY and many others blues and rock stars.MEAN OLD WORLD,T-BONE BLUES,CALL IT STORMY MONDAY and BLUES FOR MARILI remain essential stuff.It is impossible not to think of CHUCK BERRY when you listen to this guy;the guitar technique is virtually the same, but CHUCK is a better lyric writer.SHUFFLIN'THE BLUES is the closest T-BONE song ever came of rock.The quiet man from TEXAS has certainly deserved his place among the true practician of the blues.The sound quality here is good because these are 1955-56-57 recordings and not the original IMPERIAL that are also available.

Through these years, JOHNNY HALLYDAY regained his crown as the king of rock in FRANCE.But JOHNNY is not only a rocker;he can tackle ballads like few singers;he puts his soul to them.This anthology covers these years very well starting with the album ROCK'N'ROLL ATTITUDE written by the late MICHEL BERGER;GANG written by J-J.GOLDMAN(the guy who wrote CELINE DION's FRENCH albums)and CADILLAC written by ETIENNE RODA-GIL.Most of the songs are from those three albums.LAURA is actually JOHNNY'S daughter he had with actress NATHALIE BAYE.JOHNNY'S reputation has a live performer might be the reason of his stardom but this compilation shows he has good songs to deliver.

I should not give five stars to this record,but FRANCE GALL has enchanted my childhood with her innocent charm.I always feel like a kid when i listen to this her last LP for PHILLIPS.FRANCE at this time of her career is no longer the teenager darling of the famed radio program SALUT LES COPAINS.She is now 20 but can't seem to get rid of the image she helped to create a few years ago.The period that will follow will be the most difficult for her.Then in 1974,FRANCE encounters a certain MICHEL BERGER, not at all interested at first place in working with her.But FRANCE uses her considerable charm to convince him to write her new songs.Love does the rest.As for this lp,you only need to forget about your dream of having FRANCE GALL as your kid sister to enjoy it.This is SERGE GAINSBOURG'S last important collaboration for this girl who has brought him fame by recording his songs:NEFERTITI,TEENIE WEENIE BOPPIE and many others in previous lps.

You'll laugh outloud while listening to the first half of disc 1 that was not in the collection HIS LEGENDARY YEARS.Even BING CROSBY had to start somewhere.Then as you let this first disc reach it's end,BING has found himself completely by becomming AMERICA's most popular singer.Youngsters who think of him only as the guy we were always listening at CHRISTMAS time are in for a big surprize.Contrary to his legend created in the fifties,BING covered many areas of popular singing:country,IRISH songs and was one of the first to display what we call now phrasing.It is true that BING never really could get across the LP crowd like SINATRA did,but back in the thirties and fourties he was the king.Duets,songs from movies,most of them are here and are just as good as they were back then.A BING CROSBY song is easily recognizable;it is usually beautifully simple(i know it sounds corny),and has that true quality of letting you know the personnality of the man who sings it.Everybody in the music business liked BING CROSBY(ask BUDDY BREGMAN an arranger who worked with him),he was mister nice par excellence.If you want original LPS, get BING WITH A BEAT and BING SINGS WHILST BREGMAN SWINGS,both recorded in 1956-1957.The big difference with HIS LEGENDARY YEARS is of course the price and IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER stops in 1950 while the other has songs from that era.A little mistake:SOON was not written by ROBIN and RAINBERG;a RODGERS and HART fan can't get fooled that easily;BING introduced it in the movie MISSISSIPI.Don't let this correction prevent you from buying this collection because that would be a bigger mistake.

Being the most celebrated singer of his time,it is not surprizing that FRANK SINATRA is also possibly the most packaged artist in this earth.Distributors know the value of a big name.Should you buy this?If you don't know FRANK no;you should start with THE CAPITOL YEARS(1 cd or 3 cd depending on your budget).The big interest here is to hear many songs that FRANK will record again.This is the young SINATRA,not always on top of his game yet,learning his craft.There are some goodies like his first recording of SOLILOQUY originally in two parts;you also have his earliest recording FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART;the original versions of many SAMMY CAHN songs etc.Overall tough you should say to yourself this is not the FRANK SINATRA i remembered the most,and you will be right.The CAPITOL YEARS remain the core of the chairman of the board's musical achievement.The booklet is nice and has a great picture(among many others)of FRANK with AXEL STORDHAL, who was so important in creating this early sound of ol' blue eyes.

Remember the singles in the sixties, when each week there was something new available.Well, BURT BACHARACH and HAL DAVID certainly found their match when they introduced DIONNE WARWICK to the world.A string of hits followed that are collected here in a perfect package ,that is really an essential entry from the sixties.DIONNE has always had a lot of class;she went on with further success in the eighties,but fans do like to remember the beginnings of an artist.Perhaps not everysongs are memorable here,but you certainly have your money's worth while you get an important capsule to your sixties collection.

If you were a teenager in 1973-74,you remember PHILADELPHIA INTERNATIONAL and it's stars:THE O'JAYS and HAROLD MELVIN AND THE BLUE NOTES.Many of that music is remembered as the prelude of disco music.This is of course a sample of the 1972-77 heyday of the company.Many things here did not survive too well after almost thirty years.Such is the case with LOVE IS THE MESSAGE,DIRTY OL'MAN,I LOVE MUSIC and DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY all forceful and too long.They are undoubtely however part of the company's history.T.S.O.P.(THE SOUND OF PHILADELPHIA),LOVE TRAIN and BAD LUCK are the best numbers of this anthology.

MAURICE CHEVALIER once said about FREHEL:her voice seems to come from her belly.She was introduced in showbussiness by CAROLINE OTERO who send her to an editor of music.At age 18,she started to record a few songs before disappearing for many years because of drug and booze dependencies.When she returned in FRANCE,a few years after the first world war,she established herself as a realistic singer with a good range.This 2 cds collection is really the best of her repertoire.What makes FREHEL unique is that she was a singer who sang stuff that definies her own life.From COMME UN MOINEAU(one instantly thinks of PIAF) to SOUS LES PONTS,from TEL QU'IL EST to LA JAVA BLEUE we clearly can recognizes that unimitable voice who can switch from gaiety to sadness.Unfortunately,as years went by,the personnel problems continued and she ended up broke and appearing older and fatter.Still,FREHEL has earned her place in the panth&eacute;on of FRENCH singers of her time.She deserves to be remembered well.

The chemistry between FIENNES and THURMAN is non existant;the special effects are programmed to keep you from sleeping;CONNERY looks bored and should retire to cultivate tulips.The funny thing about this movie is that in FRENCH the dialogue seems better.If you are over forty like me,chances are you enjoyed the BRITISH series with DIANA RIGG and her lovely boots.The sixties have never been so popular since AUSTIN POWERS,but there is a limit to the filmgoer's tol&eacute;rance.This film works best on television as a time-killer.

Released the same year of the first BOND picture,this spy movie is an excellent incursion in the realistic world of the genre;far from the eye popping gadgetery that will be served later on with GOLDFINGER or the ridiculous MATT HELM.Acting is good throughout ,with HOLDEN giving is best performance until THE WILD BUNCH and LILI PALMER more than just the usual girl ornementation.My favorite scene:HOLDEN witnessing the execution of the woman he loves.Don't hesitate to see this film.

At first i was skeptical about this movie being a sort of remake of DIAL M FOR MURDER.However if GWYNETH PALTROW is not GRACE KELLY,she does a rather fine acting job on her own terms.MICHAEL DOUGLAS's character is a little cold hearted.The fun here is the plot twists that keep you guessing until the end.It's the kind of film you see to kill time but end up saying this is better than a simple time-killer.To resume,i would say that this is a variation of a familiar plot(the best example remains DOUBLE INDEMNITY(1944)that should maintain your interest.I still think that GRACE KELLY was the sexiest blonde in the movies,even if she kept her clothes on.

When one ones to know the degry of celebrity an artist has earned over the years following her death,just check out the numerous biographies published about the person.SARAH BERNHARDT is the most famous actress of her time;she played many roles of the repertoire ,and she also created many like ROSTAND's L'AIGLON and DUMAS's LA DAME AUX CAM&Eacute;LIAS.Like many actresses,she had an eccentric life and she actually made her name with her talent,not her beauty.This book allows you to encounter many important figures like VICTOR HUGO,ALEXANDRE DUMAS,EDMOND ROSTAND and OSCAR WILDE who were part of her life.The book is filled with pictures of the different decades of her life.If you want to read one book about her,this one can satisfy you.Beware of SARAH's memoirs,because it is a well known fact that she enjoyed the art of lying.After reading this,i had this thought.Would SARAH have managed to make the career she had in today's world?My answer is yes,even if in the process,she probably would have cut a few throats of repulsive columnists.

Like all RHINO's best of,this is a commandable collection of ARETHA's works in her early days at ATLANTIC.RESPECT,YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN and I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER(marvelous cover of the BACHARACH-DAVID song ,first recorded by DIONNE WARWICK)can be considered the highlights,but everything deserves to be there.ELEANOR RIGBY is my only complaint(RAY CHARLES's cover is great).If all the best of collections could be of the quality of those at RHINO,it would be heaven on this earth.

While not as satisfying as volume 1 which collects OTIS's greatest hits,volume 2 has three great covers:DAY TRIPPER(almost unrecognizable but great fun to hear),KNOCK ON WOOD with CARLA THOMAS and PAPA'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG the JAMES BROWN classic being a natural for OTIS.MY GIRL was hard to beat because the TEMPTATIONS's original is perfect;the same can be said about CHANGE GONNA COME that can be heard in the movie MALCOM X with the SAM COOKE version.OTIS REDDING being a legend now,has a box under his name with everything he recorded.DREAMS TO REMEMBER is an excellent anthology.Budget wise,volume 1 and 2 of this collection is a good alternative.

FRENCH op&eacute;ra lovers will want this very first recording made in 1935 in their collection,even if several pieces are missing.LOUISE was one of few op&eacute;ras in the FRENCH r&eacute;pertoire in a time when PUCCINI was the most famous op&eacute;ra composer.The work was supervised by the composer himself,which makes it historically interesting.Originally as you must know,it was a s&eacute;rie of 78's and it won the grand prix du disque that year.It was considered a landmark recording at the time.DEPUIS LE JOUR is among the most recorded FRENCH aria of all time.The melody is of course in the mold of PUCCINI in it's true romantic setting.Those who would like the complete work have at least two recordings that are available;the last one with ILEANA COTRUBAS and PLACIDO DOMINGO(the cd cover is a RENOIR painting);the other one is a live recording made in the forties.

KISS ME QUICK,SUSPICION and NIGHT RIDER should have been singles.There are undoubtedly the highlights of this 1962 record that is especially worth buying if you are a true ELVIS fan.The voice of the singer had changed a little over the years.It's softer and it's range is wider.Not all the songs here are great,but at this point of his career(just before the avalanche of ordinary movies)ELVIS has become an AMERICAN icon.It seems that the ELVIS that teenagers discovered in 1956 is really a thing of the past.Now it seems that the parents who rejected him when he sang HOUND DOG are more inclined to revaluate this guy who has mellowed at the same time of their teenagers who became adults.It is an enjoyable disc.The three tracks that i mentionned should really have been in GOLD RECORDS VOLUME 3 where they belonged.

This comedy made LAURA ANTONELLI a well known name in EUROPE.It took a few years for AMERICANS to discover her.In 1979,most of her best films were finally distributed.MALICIOUS is a wonderful satire on ITALIANS and the hypocrisy of their morals.The movie is almost spoiled by it's overexploitative use of LAURA's extraordinary beauty in the end.The film was very successfull in ITALY, and LAURA made two other comedies with director SALVATORE SAMPERI,both unfortunately minor works.MALICIA and THE INNOCENT remain her best movies.

Anyone who would like to start buying MAURANE cds should start with a live recording(either the double OLYMPIA set or the less expensive recent single one).MAURANE really comes alive on stage like most great artists.This collection is a good overview of the years that followed her great success in the FRENCH revival of STARMANIA,the famous musical.The first five songs were in the 1989 MAURANE her first POLYDOR record;other songs were taken from her subsequent cd's AMI OU ENNEMI and DIFFERENTE.CHANSON POUR LES TAUPES displays the singer's formidable skills that all her artists friends and fans know for personating and also make fun at her own expense.Very close to her fans,MAURANE is an artist totally unpretentious;a rare thing in showbusiness.

I must confess that i am not a so called country music fanatic.However,those two back to back 1963 lps reunited are just what i needed to start my exploration.Perhaps it is the laidback DINO attitude that contributed to my enjoyment,but the singer was a natural for the genre and the classics like I'M SO LONESOME I SHOULD CRY,I WALK THE LINE and HEY GOOD LOOKIN are given first class treatment.My feeling was: let's try a country cd for a change,and unexpectedly i was pleased with the results.Maybe you are like me and thought you wouldn't buy a country cd of your life.Well,this could also do the trick for you like it did with me.With the recent r&eacute;&eacute;dition of the whole REPRISE catalogue,DEAN MARTIN is bound to gain many new fans.Let's hope so!

DEAN MARTIN's discography is really something to behold.Those two lps on one cd are a typical example.The first DEAN MARTIN HITS AGAIN it seems is a quickie;one gets the feeling that the wine was pouring a little to hard on those sessions.Try to figure out how many songs are molded on the first track.Three songs in a row have the same word on the title and this is not a concept lp.On the other hand,HOUSTON is a good mix of country and pop songs and I WILL, the last top ten hit of DEAN's career was indeed perfect for him.Trying to figure out the many ups and downs of DINO's recordings can actually take a few years out of your life.This guy DEAN MARTIN,perhaps this is the main reason we love him so much is quite an enigma in itself.We all agree nevertheless that he was an accomplished singer.

While not as good as the 1964 and 1966 classics BRASSENS albums,this cd also available in a 20th anniversary edition still delivers the good.There is no bad BRASSENS offering really,let it be known.The title track dealing with the pain of being a star is delightful.(BRASSENS has always refused to play this role.)LA COMPLAINTE DES FILLES DE JOIE is about the prostitutes and their problems that we should considerate(now isn't that funny?);JEANNE is the woman with whom GEORGES lived until the midsixties(it was not a love story);LE TEMPS NE FAIT RIEN A L'AFFAIRE is about people who remain dumb all their lives.In all,this is a sort of catalogue of his themes

This cd is also available in a 20th anniversary edition of the death of the now legendary songwriter.Few artists have remained as true to their nature like BRASSENS was;a guitar,a bass and lyrics,this is all he needed to create one of the most admired body of work in all french music.This 1966 offering has him toying with his favorite themes:death,women and ancestral ages and still managing to shape a marvellous product that defies the ages.The first song SUPPLIQUE...is one of his most famous and rightly so,since it deals with his imaginary death;if you don't know much about the french language,you better pass that one;LES QUATRE BACHELIERS is GEORGES's tribute to his father;LE MOYENNAGEUX has him saying he should have lived in the middle age;LA FESS&Eacute;E is actually about the dubious nature of some women.In all, this is a grade A BRASSENS recording ,that fans should possess.

Recorded on april 24 1962 at the OLYMPIA de PARIS,this live set is enjoyable, but can not be considered a classic.Highlights for me are OLE MISS from W.C.HANDY and THE FAITHFUL HUSSAR(LOUIS actually says that he picked it up in DUSSERDOLF).He plays some familiar numbers of his repertoire like WHEN IT SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH,A KISS TO BUILD A DREAM ON and BLUEBERRY HILL.STRUTTIN' WITH SOME BARBECUE,a famous instrumental from the HOT FIVE,HOT SEVEN days is done at a slow tempo.HIGH SOCIETY is of course the title track of the 1956 movie.NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN is beautifully sung in a straight fashion.Obviously,LOUIS was very fond of this song.The in&eacute;vitable MACK THE KNIFE ,that was recorded by everyone from DARIN to SINATRA and FITZGERALD closes the disc.So as the man often says,this is not a bad recording, but it belongs in the collection of a true SATCHMO fanatic.

Overall this book collects most of the facts of ELLA's life and career in nice perspective.However i must say this:Mister NICHOLSON while preparing the biography has not met his subject and has included some totally out of place remarks that makes his book a shameful attempt to collect royalties he does not deserve.Mister NICHOLSON who i beleive never conducted an orchestra try to demonstrate that BUDDY BREGMAN the conductor of the PORTER and RODGERS songbooks failed to deliver the goods,allthough millions of fans throughout the world consider them to be the best of the series.Mister NICHOLSON sad to say has caught a severe case we should call the RIDDLE syndrome.Still,you can buy that book and still get to know ELLA if you can read between the lines.

All of those works are linked together and fit well in a so called BELLE &Eacute;POQUE concept.The masterpiece is of course the FRANCK sonata that also works well in a violoncello transcription.That famous sonata is undoutbtedly remembered as the epitome of the era.It has a particular sad mood that really gets to you if you are sensitive.It would be nice to put alongside this cd SUSAN GRAHAM'album of the same title.You can go to sleep peacefully after those two.

I can't beleive someone can think of resuming MILES in 1 cd.This is simply dumb,dumb,dumb and it reduces a great musician to a few samples.Like COLTRANE, MILES had a multi level career,each one advancing his taste for reaching new steps everytime.The MILES DAVIS QUINTET with JOHN COLTRANE has possibly become the greatest jazz band ever.The box collecting their works is marvellous.Why not buy ROUND MIDNIGHT and SKETCHES OF SPAIN and if you like them, you can go from there?CIVIL WAR:GREAT;BASEBALL:GREAT;JAZZ:READ A GOOD BOOK INSTEAD

This is where it all started for BRASSENS.His whole universe is allready there.Originally,most of these songs were first released in 78(the lp era had not started yet in FRANCE).It is hard today to imagine the commotion caused by LE GORILLE which was of course intented as a joke.The radios used to say:who is this guy and where does he come from?he doesn't sing,he mumbles.Well know fifty years have gone buy,and this guy from the south of FRANCE has become a legend;dozen of books have been written about him.For the record here,four songs were poetry put to music;3 were by PAUL FORT(BRASSENS'S favorite poet;he actually knew him well).CORNE D'AUROCHS was a friend of the singer.PATACHOU who sings MAMAN,PAPA with him is the woman who gave him his first chance to sing in her cabaret;she actually pushed him on the stage,because she could not sing some of his songs.This is a true story.SETE,the birthplace of BRASSENS is also PAUL VALERY's birthplace.

Officially,this is BRASSENS's final record;two other ones will be released later with songs that GEORGES never recorded.His good friend JEAN BERTOLA will materialize that task.This 12 th offering is not one of his best,although it contains three wonderful songs:TROMPE LA MORT,LES RICOCHETS and CUPIDON S'EN FOUT.Also included in this 20th anniverssary edition ,three bonus tracks that are missfires and unnecessary.Still,for die hard fans of the singer,it is worth getting.Others can well resume BRASSENS with a two cd set of highlights.Like the previous albums of 1969 and 1972,the familiar themes are still there,but it seems that generally the balance between the music and the lyrics are not as successfull like they were in the past.

While a few songs are missing from the original score,on its own terms, this musical comedy is quite enjoyable due to good casting.It was a common thing to remove songs and sometimes add some at that time.In SHOWBOAT ,they did not add any new ones.AGNES MOREHEAD is of course remembered best for her role in the television series BEWITCHED.She had made her name many years before this film acting in ORSON WELLES's films and theatre productions.Purists should go to the wonderful restauration of this classic show made on a 1988 recording,its worth getting.One must never forget that SHOWBOAT was the first show to deal with important subjects like interrelations among blacks and whites.

This album starts very well with 7 excellent numbers, then the second half is not as good due to the inferior quality of the songs.In a way,WHERE ARE YOU is not underrated.It's good but certainly can't compete with WEE SMALL HOURS.AUTUMN LEAVES which is by the way a FRENCH song first sung by YVES MONTAND is beautifully done.Later on GORDON JENKINS and FRANK recorded their CHRISTMAS album which must be counted among their greatest together along with SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS on REPRISE.Fans of FRANK who had the original vinyl version of the first CAPITOL album will remember that I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES and IT WORRIES ME were added on a second edition along with two other songs.

This is my all time favorite SINATRA cd.Against a set of strings,FRANK never sang better;his voice really comes across beautifully.The question remains:why did he not repeat that experience?A mystery to me.On that cd alone,FRANK equals NAT KING COLE as a ballad singer.At that time 1956,NELSON RIDDLE and SINATRA worked together like twin brothers,everything they did was good:SONGS FOR SWINGIN`LOVERS,A SWINGIN AFFAIR.When the RAT PACK enters,FRANK will begin the self-indulgence and his fans will suffer a little.You've got to buy this one to experience what a great singer FRANK SINATRA was.Each song comes out well in NELSON RIDDLE'S master chef recipes.

A very uneven recording from FRANK and BILLY MAY who treated us royally with COME FLY WITH ME and COME DANCE WITH ME.How could they miss on classics like ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET and THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC goes beyond me.I LOVE YOU is possibly the worst song FRANK recorded in the CAPITOL years.Who choosed YES INDEED ! and that gospel atmosphere that seems unfit for SINATRA?On the positive side,i like ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE,FIVE MINUTES MORE and AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE a lot because they are easy to take songs that are fun to listen.Let's settle for a contractual obligation that the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD had to deliver before leaving CAPITOL;after all singing is also a job.I have the feeling somehow that someone will remind me that FRANK's worst song is THERE'S A FLAW IN MY FLUE(but it had a wonderful melody)

As the man says,you can buy the whole CAPITOL collection eyes closed,that's a fact that will always remain true among the old blue eyes fans.On this cd,FRANK and NELSON RIDDLE have decided to refresh the old COLUMBIA catalog with generally good results.Among the highlights here are the reprise of FOOLS RUSH IN and the slower version of DAY IN,DAY OUT;IRVING BERLIN'S HOW DEEP IS THE OCEAN was never better.As for the rest,it is interesting to be sure,but not vintage SINATRA.We know that FRANK always liked SHE'S FUNNY THAT WAY for personnals reasons,as for the other songs like SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME,EMBRACEABLE YOU(I GO WITH SARAH VAUGHAN);MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE(JUNE CHRISTY);TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS(FOREVER ASSOCIATED WITH OTIS REDDING);THE NEARNESS OF YOU(DICK HAYMES).To conclude,let me just say that the more versions of a song that exists the listener doubles the pleasure ,even if he has to choose his favorite.Having said that,i pay my respect to FRANK SINATRA,AMERICA'S greatest singer of his time

A medium SINATRA ,like most 60's and 70's offerings if you except THE CONCERT SINATRA and SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS, both vintage records.This disc offers wonderful new arrangments of two classics songs :CHANGE PARTNERS and I CONCENTRATE ON YOU.The title track is a pleasing affair.It might have been titled SINATRA goes mystic with the r&eacute;cuperation of the bossa-nova craze.It is especially worth it if you're a die hard fan of SINATRA.Others can well pass it out.No offense FRANK,wherever you are in heaven.

Enjoyable live set in which ELLA transforms THE LADY IS A TRAMP with new lyrics at the end(a live setting permits these things);MACK THE KNIFE and HOW HIGH THE MOON are also different from the originals.It's as though-it's of course a joke-ELLA sniffed something and those were the result of the effect.The rest is tastefully done ,with SUMMERTIME a highlight in this beautiful subdued version.I especially liked the fact that the musicians do not overheilm the singer as it is often the case with live albums.Don't make the mistake of buying that edition like i did.Buy the complete ELLA in BERLIN.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the overture is done like in a kiddie show.This aside,this recording is very delectable,even if it's hard to erase of our memory the original cast album or the soundtrack of the movie.Curiously,AMAZON has forgot to tell his customers that this recording includes LONELY ROOM,a song that was cut from the movie and also from the original cast album.JOHN RAITT ,the original BILLY BIGELOW of CAROUSEL does a fine job in the part of CURLY.This show is so AMERICAN in a good old fashion way,that it should never be played in CHINA,even if ADO ANNIE looks like CHINEESE food.

Although he is well recognized as one of AMERICA's best songwriter,BROADWAY has often eluded JOHNNY MERCER during his lifetime.LI'L ABNER was one of his most successfull show with a run of 693 performances in 1956.Written with composer GENE DE PAUL with whom MERCER had collaborated on the movie SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS,it is filled with marvellous songs like NAMELY YOU and THE COUNTRY'S IN THE VERY BEST OF HANDS.Who but the man from SAVANNAGH could have written such a satiristic song like JUBILATION T.CORNPONE?Needless to say that this reedition is a must for any MERCER devotee,with several added tracks.The original cast was full of beautiful girls.Some reedition are worth waiting for,this is one of them.Just beware of that CORNPONE,he may influence the current politicians.

Resuming JOHN COLTRANE in 1 cd is not a good idea at all, since the man had five transformations in his career.The COLTRANE who played with DIZZY GILLESPIE in the early fifties is a different man than the COLTRANE who was free jazz's best frontrunner along with MINGUS, DOLPHY and COLEMAN.Instead of buying this rehash, you should buy the following albums:ROUND MIDNIGHT with MILES DAVIS;GIANT STEPS which has JOHN finding himself and IMPRESSIONS with ERIC DOLPHY which is the best example of intelligent free jazz.If you like those ,then go to ASCENSION a very difficult album to digest.KEN BURNS i am sorry to say ,is more at ease with baseball and the civil war than he is with jazz.

Excellent r&eacute;sum&eacute; of L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute;'s greatest years 1960-1974.Some of you out there will be put off by some of the songs in the second cd, because some of those are more like monologue rather than songs,anticipating the latest phase of his career.Mostly ,you'll find here songs with superb lyrics who means something.This is FRENCH poetic music of a superior kind.You won't find in this collection nothing from the records devoted to the FRENCH poets:ARAGON,APOLLINAIRE,BAUDELAIRE,VERLAINE and RIMBAUD.This is L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute; in his own turf and it's wonderful.AVEC LE TEMPS is often considered to be his greatest song. It is actually about the failure of his relation with his second wife.It was recorded by many other artists afterwards;P&Eacute;P&Eacute;E is about a chimpanz&eacute;(no it's not a joke);JOLIE MOME is an archetypical song from the early sixties with musette overtones.While there was a L&Eacute;O FERR&Eacute; before and after that collection(the latter being hermetic),there is a conscencious among the fans that this collection represents the artist in full maturity.So you may not enjoy everything here,but often the best will simply overwheilm the rest.There are shades of greatness present to be sure.

I can hear you think up there:DEBUSSY,this is the guy who composed the two ARABESQUES right?If you are not too familiar with the rest of his piano music,here's your chance by buying his complete piano music in two volumes and 4cds for a reasonnable price.Purists will tell you that WERNER HAAS is the not the best interpret of his piano works.Perhaps this is the truth,but you won't get DEBUSSY's complete piano music at such a low price anywhere.CHILDREN'S CORNER is the composer's hommage to SCHUMANN and was dedicated to his daughter.Many of you will consider the PRELUDES and the IMAGES to be intellectual type of music.The ESTAMPES are for me one good example why DEBUSSY can be considered as the most important piano composer of his time.Volume 2 has the 12 &eacute;tudes,his final piano writings and the superb SUITE BERGAMASQUE, conceived as a suite like the CHILDREN'S CORNER and POUR LE PIANO.The two ARABESQUES and the REVERIE will have you say:I heard this before.Buy the the COMPLETE PIANO MUSIC VOL 1 and 2,and you'll get more than 5 hours of MONSIEUR CROCHE(DEBUSSY'S pseudonym for his articles in LA REVUE BLANCHE)

SERGE GAINSBOURG has never been better in establish a concept thematicelly in terms of words and music.Each piece of this wonderful opus has a musical setting that is coherent in it's ensemble.32 minutes of pure joy and delight.The famous GAINSBOURG talking voice over was of course used before in recordings like JE T'AIME MOI NON PLUS,INITIALES BB and the previous concept album HISTOIRE DE M&Eacute;LODY NELSON,but never with that panache with the lyrics.VARIATIONS SUR MARILOU can r&eacute;sume GAINSBOURG's whole catalogue of themes and obsessions.Sit down,forget your presomptions about the often called dirty man of FRENCH music and listen to signifiant music by a creatively inspired artist.If you are wondering about the meaning of the lyrics of VARIATIONS SUR MARILOU,it's actually about woman masturbation.No kidding here,just the truth.

The problem with the music of our time,is that we don't have the equivalent of what FATS WALLER represented in those days.FATS was a talented pianist,a fabulous entertainer who didn't take himself seriously.The key to his personality was his spontaneity.If these 1935 radio transcriptions are so enjoyable there are many reasons;this cd is like going to your favorite uncle who used to play the piano and tell jokes in between.FATS was not a great singer,but somehow his voice comes across beautifully.Everything is of interest here,but the stride piano playing is the standout.Somehow, you are inclined to think that the bottle of gin was standing by near him ,but he didn't touch it until the end of these recordings.

This is BING CROSBY's best original LP.We'll never thank BUDDY BREGMAN enough for this.Let's not forget that BING was the most popular AMERICAN singer before FRANK SINATRA came in .The choice of songs was perfect;the swinging horn laden orchestra goes around and do not outplays BING's voice.You'll notice that whenever a CROSBY song is in a songbook tribute collection,they choose the songs from that album.BING was a gentleman in the true sense of the world;his honesty was never fainted.In fact,this record is BING going to SINATRA's turf and finding that he could do it.My only regret is that after he made that record,BING was more inclined to play golf than to record,but the man had worked hard in the 30's and 40's,so he had the right to make things easier for him.Along with the collection HIS LEGENDARY YEARS,a must for any BING CROSBY fan,this is a record to treasure forever.

Parts of this book are also in the paperbacks C'&Eacute;TAIT LE XXe SIECLE published in 1999 on POCKET.I have read tome 2 of L'HISTOIRE EN QUESTION.It is fascinating throughout,complete with pictures.DECAUX here choose 9 stories that are all unique in their own way.Let me say this,if we had history teachers like MISTER DECAUX in highschool,we would have been in heaven.Unfortunately,it was not the case.What distinguish mister DECAUX from many other historians,his is ability to communicate his passion for the subjects.He manages to condensate his stories without losing grip of their ambiguous nature.Once you lay your hands on one of his books,you may want to read them all.The greatest compliment any writer can receive.

Modestly,REN&Eacute;E FLEMING always gives credit to her mother for her singing talent.If this is so,the voice has been well trained because FLEMING is one of the best sopranos of our time.The repertoire here is quite widerange,perhaps a little too much.I would have prefer for example,a whole set of FRENCH arias instead of only three.DEPUIS LE JOUR and L'AIR DES BIJOUX are worlwide known;L'AIR DES BIJOUX is always associated with LA CASTAFIORE,a character of TINTIN.Having said that,a wonderful voice like FLEMING's is always a treat whatever the repertoire given.With REN&Eacute;E FLEMING,the classical world is in good hands for sure.JEFFREY TATE the conductor, was associated years ago with pianist MITSUKO UCHIDA in a series of MOZART concertos among other things.

This record is a perfect sampler of COLTRANE's early free jazz style that will go increasingly difficult to digest later on with ASCENSION.Some people will even question the fact that it can qualify as music.With IMPRESSIONS, JOHN had perhaps reached his peak in all aspects.The interplay with ERIC DOLPHY shows two great musicians willing to experiment and those two were so remarkably talented.COLTRANE was jazz's last great innovator and long pieces like IMPRESSIONS are a battlefield to showcase his machinegun imagination.Not a record to buy if you're not inclined to that kind of jazz,but a delight if you are game.

His life was cut short by a fatal plane crash at 22.His vocal harmonies influenced THE BEATLES and many other vocal groups.Do you really need 50 songs on 2 cds?I for myself could have manage without the first 13 songs of cd one.The early rockabilly numbers are certainly not essential.From BROWN EYED HANDSOME MAN(the first CHUCK BERRY cover?) on,everything is vintage, which makes this collection a must.Ballads like TRUE LOVE WAYS and RAINING IN MY HEART are so incredibly nostalgic,they can make you cry.BUDDY HOLLY remains unique.There will never be another like him.To employ a common clich&eacute;,when BUDDY HOLLY died,rock never really recovered.Unfortunately,there is some truth to that.

Here are the songs that will always be associated with SATCHMO before the sixties.In his career,LOUIS recorded with virtually every record company:DECCA,RCA,VERVE,COLUMBIA and even CAPITOL(the soundtrack of HIGH SOCIETY).In the best of department,he is the world champion.Trying to compile the numerous greatest hits cds in his catalogue is quite a task.This one is among the ones that delivers the goods.Once you've heard ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STEET done by him or everything else heard here,you can never imagine another doing it.As LOUIS says to BING during GONE FISHIN:you ain't tight up you dog and THE GYPSY although she often lies was right when she told you to buy this.This disc is offered at a low price and ... is never out of stock with SATCHMO.

A good choice in any lists of BING CROSBY's all time best LP,BING WITH A BEAT is a immensely enjoyable trip to the DIXIELAND days.BING is perfectly at ease in displaying his good natured charm here that permits him to go back to his roots without repeating himself.Many songs in this LP are also in the LOUNGE LEGENDS AND OTHER STARS collection and it's no wonder.Is there a better version of an IRVING BERLIN song than this one:SOME SUNNY DAY?I can't think of a record that definies more the quality of BING CROSBY's singing and the simplicity that was BERLIN's trademark.The whole cd is a gem for any CROSBY fan.In fact,you'll probably want to give this cd to your grandfather, and then end up getting a copy for yourself.I can garantee you that you'll play this one often,it won't melt in your musical library.

When BING CROSBY became a superstar in the early thirties with records and movies,it was the JAZZ age.BING made a lot of money,alienated a few friends on his way to stardom,married DIXIE LEE,had many affairs with other women on the cover,and then after winning a battle with the bottle continued to neglect his wife who became an alcoolic and died from cancer in the early fifties.Many aspects of this biography will disappoint the CROSBY fans who thought he was a saint.The authors i think tried simply to tell the truth about the man and his complexity.You'll learn many things about him if you read that book,not only the negative side of course.

If you're interested in reading about SERGE GAINSBOURG beware ,because many books focused too much on the trashy aspect of his life(women,booze etc.)This is not the case with GILLES VERLANT ,who knew GAINSBOURG well enough to know the man well.There are many editions of this book on the market.It is not vain to know GAINSBOURG from the inside;you'll learn about his RUSSIAN background;his early struggle before success came his way in the sixties;his complex personnality both savage and charming.His gift for composing fast was really true;he also liked to modify a song just before recording it.Anecdotes with musical conductors who worked with him over the years are fun to read.In all,this is a true portrait of SERGE GAINSBOURG, who ten years after his death has become a legend.

A collection offering most of CARMICHAEL's mostly remembered songs between the late twenties until 1950 is always a good buy.This one has HOAGY singing his own songs the way only him could do in his sleepy kind of SOUTHERN grace.The same can be said of his friend JOHNNY MERCER with whom he wrote many songs.If you've never heard them sing their songs you miss something.Those SOUTHERN guys were easy living characters who had a special kind of charm.STARDUST is there in it's piano version;ROCKIN'CHAIR with a young LOUIS ARMSTRONG in a duet;many other duets and other delights make this a perfect compagnon to the CAPITOL singers singing his songs.But as you may remember there was a song that BING CROSBY used to sing that's not included here why?It was IN THE COOL COOL COOL OF THE EVENING from the film HERE COMES THE GROOM.Sorry, but you can't have everything.

The only problem of this film is that we all know how it will end.It's hard to think of a better time killer;i say this in a positive way.My favorite scene is near the end, when CHACAL acts like an old man who lost one leg which in fact hides his arsenal.Fans of director FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT will recognize MICHEL LONSDALE as the commissaire and in a supporting part PHILLIPE LEOTARD as a cop who informs the commissaire.DELPHINE SEYRIG ,who with LONSDALE played husband and wife in STOLEN KISSES, has a little role.We can support good movies like this anytime.

Not all the songs have survived well here,but there are enough good stuff to satisfy anyone with a nostalgic ear.Among the highlights are the original version of MAKIN'WHOPPEE as it was done in the show in 1928;THE AUTOMOBILE SONG is also fun to hear.With AL JOLSON,EDDIE CANTOR came to symbolize a whole area of AMERICAN culture that we should not forget.These collections have one major drawback for music lovers:it seems that for them,nobody write or compose songs,so they must come from the sky or something.Who wrote who?You must know your AMERICAN songbook rather well to know who wrote HUNGRY WOMEN for instance.

It would have been a perfect best of if instead of HUSH,KENTUCY WOMAN,STRANGE KIND OF WOMAN and DEMON'S EYE,some live cuts from LIVE IN JAPAN,one of the most famous rock live albums of the seventies with GET YER YA YA'S OUT and LIVE AT LEEDS would have been incuded.As it is,it's still good because it collects all the greatest hits.The liner notes are excellent,delivering the turbulent story of a group forever associated with the birth of hard-rock.Who would have thought at the time that DEEP PURPLE with LED ZEPPELIN and BLACK SABBATH had created a genre that would stay popular until the early nineties,even if the word heavy-metal finally replaced the hard-rock craze?The riffs,the voice of IAN GILLAN who had so many imitators remain potent.

This is an excellent overview of OFFENBACH'S life and works,focusing on his best operettas that are the objects of a good analysis.Like all great composers of the past,OFFENBACH needs to be replaced in his original context to be fully appreciated.What you learn is that he was a family man who loved his children.He was also a composer who had many parallels with ROSSINI;both were considered bouffons and desperetately wanted to be taken seriously as composers.There are pictures of HORTENSE SCHNEIDER who created many roles and a few of him as well.OFFENBACH was a favorite victim of the caricaturistes of his time.He was also in a way a feminist before his time,because he created strong characters for women.In all,this is a usefull book,worth reading.

Since AMAZON doesn't seem to have the wonderful 2cd collection with 52 songs,you have to settle for this one,but as you know real fans have eliminated the word settling of their vocabulary.If you don't know it,VINCENT SCOTTO was the most important FRENCH composer of the first half of the previous century.Virtually everyone from MAURICE CHEVALIER to MISTINGUETT,ALIBERT,TINO ROSSI and many others recorded his songs;some of his songs like LA PETITE TONKINOISE were hits twice with different performers.VINCENT SCOTTO was born in MARSEILLE in 1874 and he died in 1952.It is estimed that he wrote over 4,000 songs, which means that anyone having an interest in FRENCH music must sometimes gives some attention to this guy.Like many in his time like HENRI CHRISTIN&Eacute; and MAURICE YVAIN ,he wrote many songs for operettas that were very popular at that time....

This is certainly not the best overview of DINAH SHORE.While you get some hits,some of the songs(YES MY DARLING DAUGHTER,PERSONALITY)show their age and could have been easily subsitued by other songs far better that the singer recorded.It would be sad if your judgement of her should rely only with this quick package release because RCA is 100 years old.DINAH deserves better;she was a wonderful tv show hostess,full of charm and wit.I am old enough to remember the last years she had a show,and it was fun to hear beautiful songs of the repertoire sung by her.There are better collection like the RCA-COLUMBIA package,A PORTRAIT OF DINAH SHORE etc.You should find them easily;you just have to choose.

Representative highlights of soprano YVONNE PRINTEMPS's career,with excerps of MESSAGER's classic V&Eacute;RONIQUE;HAHN's operetta MOZART, which she created with her first husband SACHA GUITRY;the OSCAR STRAUSS numbers,while very popular at the time,have not aged so well.Still,overall this is a good summary of her career.YVONNE PRINTEMPS was a beloved figure in FRANCE between the two world wars.She in a way,helped to perpetuate the operetta tradition in FRANCE.We can honoured her for that,a difficult task that she fitted to perfection.

BREL's originals albums are available in 2 for 1 edition or in their original sleeve LPS presentation.That cd like all of BREL from 1962 to 1968 is terrific all the way.CES GENS-LA is a masterful attack on bourgeois life(only BREL could act out a song like this).It's shows why he was the best actor among the singer of his generation.FERNAND about the death of a friend is moving;GRAND-MERE is hilarious because it's about a gay woman.Very few artists could compete with JACQUES BREL in terms of showmanship.People who saw him performing live have fond memories of this great artist, who gave everything he had before he quit performing live in 1966.As years go buy,we realize that BREL has remained unique and will never be forgotten by his fans.

DOMINIQUE BONA has produced a fine portrait of this woman who was the only repr&eacute;sentant of her sex among the impressionists.BERTHE MORISOT had a close relationship with EDOUARD MANET(she married his brother EUGENE).Along the way,the book lets you know the other artists of this movement:MONET,DEGAS,RENOIR etc.The struggles of their acceptance is well documented.Nowadays,the litterature about the impressionist school is abondant.After all,this was the beginning of modern art.DOMINIQUE BONA is a gifted writer who wrote other biographies and a few novels.

Like all his soul mates of the sixties,CURTIS MAYFIELD started with his IMPRESSIONS a gentle and delicate sound,well suited to his low voice.By the end of the sixties,CURTIS turned socially conscencious and his writing deepened enough to become more than simple entertainment.CURTIS reached his peak with CURTIS and the soundtrack for the movie SUPERFLY.Still, those early IMPRESSIONS songs like GYPSY WOMAN,MINSTREL AND QUEEN,IT'S ALL RIGHT and PEOPLE GET READY retain their particular charm.This good anthology covers both his music with THE IMPRESSIONS and his solo career.CURTIS's voice is not like any other of the time,his sweet tone is like velvet.

HOAGY CARMICHAEL has become famous as the guy who composed two of his country's most famous songs:STARDUST and GEORGIA ON MY MIND.Is there anybody out there who never heard them?Come on baby,don't tell lies.HOAGY was also in his lifetime a supporting actor in movies like TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT.This collection gives you a good sample of his talent as a composer.Most of these songs were written between 1929 and 1946.LOUIS ARMSTRONG made ROCKIN'CHAIR popular;RAY CHARLES made GEORGIA ON MY MIND worldwide.My personal favorites among these are LAZY BONES and THE NEARNESS OF YOU which is sung by DICK HAYMES ,who was in the forties FRANK SINATRA's rival and is now remembered as the guy who sang in the RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN's movie STATE FAIR.

If you read ELLA's biography written by STUART NICHOLSON,you know that NELSON RIDDLE was the first choice of NORMAN GRANZ to arrange material for the songbooks.But in 1956,RIDDLE was a very busy man,working with SINATRA,PEGGY LEE and DEAN MARTIN on lps that are now considered classics.ELLA's first time at bat with NELSON was the mamooth GERSHWIN songbook of 1959.After that, they worked many times together.This 1972 album with several tracks recorded in 1978 is certainly of interest to any FITZGERALD fan,even if SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR,AFTER YOU and WITHOUT LOVE are not among PORTER's greatest songs.I CONCENTRATE ON YOU is in bossa-nova,and if you ever heard DOWN IN THE DEPTH in it's original rendition,you'll rave over this one.It may not surpass the 1956 recordings that kicked off the songbook series,but it's a nice compagnon.

TATUM was simply the greatest jazz pianist ever.No one could switch from one key to another at such a speed.It's no wonder that many famous classical pianists came to recognize his unique talent as a soloist.The first time i heard LOVE FOR SALE,i could not beleive that there was only one man playing the piano.This recording is a good sample of his works recorded on NORMAN GRANZ's label PABLO.The way this man played can not be teached,it is a gift from god.As generations go by,pianists come and go,but TATUM remains in a class by himself.

BARBARA was a singer who struggled many years before success came her way in the sixties.She created a sort of intimate character that ones recognize rapidly.BARBARA's songs are often autobiographical;such is the case here with R&Eacute;MUSAT and MON ENFANCE who are obviously about her mother.There is also a sad BARBARA,in FRENCH,we call this le mal de vivre, that is present everywhere in her discography.Maybe some people can find her a little depressing,but there is always a warm humanity about her.Selections of live recordings was a good idea,since there was a special love story between the fans and the artist.With BARBARA,the feeling was never artificial,it was real.

Follow up to the previous collection;includes many live versions of songs.When BARBARA started in the fifties,she sang the song of others(BRASSENS,BREL etc).In the sixties, LA DAME EN NOIR started to write for herself.Included here are some of her most famous titles(L'AIGLE NOIR,MA PLUS BELLE HISTOIRE D'AMOUR,NANTES etc.)Sensitive people usually enjoy her music.Rock fans should go elsewhere.BARBARA died in 1997.As years go by,true artists like her never really leave;they remained fresh because they were not only there to make money;they really cared about their fans.

As usual with that collection,you've got your money's worth.Most early hits are collected here, plus many wonderful versions of famous songs like LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME(one of the most recorded songs in history)and IF I LOVED YOU from CAROUSEL and BODY AND SOUL.You'll notice that PERRY sings the lyrics clearly;you absolutely hear every word of each song.While THE VERY BEST OF remains the best buy if you want only one cd of him,this is certainly not a waste of your money.If your a fan,you'll like this collection to stand alongside the ones of FRANK's COLUMBIA records and also DICK HAYMES,probably the best crooner of the time.Mister COMO had class,and if he recorded dubious novelty songs once in a while,only RCA should be blamed.

At first ,i was fooled by this record,comparing it with his masterworks of the seventies.By listening to it over and over, i went deeper to it,and i really enjoyed it.At that particular time of his career,STEVIE WONDER had nothing to proove;he had already won many GRAMMIES(all deserved),and was a confirmed superstar.This record has STEVIE going back to his roots without disminished what he had already accomplished.When an artist of this stature has made it to the top,it is never easy to continue in the ever changing world of popular music.STEVIE has done so by remaining himself and by creating songs which shows that he cares about this world.All the songs here demonstrates the different sides of the artist in a true display of his melodic gifts.

In 1986,MOTOWN had allready well compiled SMOKEY AND THE MIRACLES with a 2 cd ANTHOLOGY of 45 songs.In 1998,they simply eliminated a few songs to make a single cd of highlights.This excellent selection shows why ROBINSON was among the best composer of the sixties with his label mates H-D-H.But SMOKEY did more than write for his group,he also wrote songs for MARY WELLS,THE TEMPTATIONS etc.BERRY GORDY once called his friend the most unselfish person i know.He will always be remembered as one of the guys who helped to establish the original MOTOWN sound of DETROIT.I'll TRY SOMETHING NEW,OOO BABY BABY and THE TRACKS OF MY TEARS my personal favorites ,were recorded by other artists later.MICKEY'S MONKEY and GOING TO A-GO GO(covered by THE STONES on one of their live albums)were the novelty songs.God bless you SMOKEY ROBINSON.

In our troubled times,they are so inclined to edit the old LPS to cd that mistakes are made in r&eacute;impression.Don't let that disturb you here because here is one of BARBARA's best record,even if it only goes 32minutes.Intimacy is the key word for the singer who passed away in 1997.MICHEL COLOMBIER's orchestral work suits BARBARA perfectly;it permits her to write her songs the way she likes:her voice is delicate and shows her sensitive approach.The title track has become her most famous song.Artists like BARBARA are cruelly missing in today's music industry.

This 1974 release was a box office failure.CATHERINE's die hard fans will remember that at that time she was the CHANEL no 5 woman on television commercials.This supernatural story directed by JUAN BUNUEL is interesting in parts,but not satisfying as a whole.Such supernatural films were rare in FRENCH cinema at that time.However, those who admire CATHERINE DENEUVE's stunning figure(a lot of us guys belong in this group)will be in heaven watching this.CATHERINE's legendary blonde hair is much on display throughout,and there's a famous unexpected nude scene.Girls ,if your boyfriend or husband's fantasy is DENEUVE in her prime,buy him this and let him enjoy while you do the shopping with his money.He'll forget about the change.

When someone ask me which first cd of LOUIS they should buy,i always answer buy this one,it's a perfect selection of LOUIS singing.There are other superb collection of his recordings available,but very few offer you 78 minutes of pure SATCHMO magic.There are the signature songs:ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STEET,C'EST SI BON,WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD,HELLO DOLLY;there are the funny ones:GONE FISHIN',MACK THE KNIFE,JEEPERS CREEPERS;The good book:NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN,GO DOWN MOSES;The traditional:WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN,SWEET GEORGIA BROWN and finally,there are hits:WHEN YOU'RE SMILING,ONLY YOU,LA VIE EN ROSE,MOONRIVER.What else do you need?About the only complaint i can formulate is that they did not include the best version of BLUEBERRY HILL available.This is still super vintage SATCHMO.Get it you dog;you rascal you.

It's always a pleasure to celebrate MOMO who made so many people aware of the FRENCH culture throughout the world.This collection is wonderful;most of it is a reminicence of MAURICE's early years in HOLLYWOOD 1928-1935.It is interesting to notice that many songs here were recorded also in FRENCH.Such is the case with MY LOVE PARADE(mon cocktail d'amour),PARIS,STAY THE SAME(paris,je t'aime d'amour),YOU BROUGHT A NEW KIND OF LOVE TO ME(vous etes mon nouveau bonheur)and JUST A BUM(ma pomme).CHEVALIER also recorded MIMI in both languages.There is one important complaint i have to say:why not mentionning the names of the writers and the composers of the songs?Of course,this is not a good enough reason not to buy this.Maybe they were afraid to paid some of the writers and composers who are still alive.Not everybody for instance knows that THE POOR APACHE was written by RODGERS AND HART for the 1932 film LOVE ME TONIGHT.

WILLIAM McBRIEN has done it;he has given all the PORTER fans of this world the biography they were waiting for for thirty-four years.What this book gives us is an accurate account of the composer's life including his well known homosexuality, even if he married for respectability.PORTER's early years were quite different when compare with the other composers of his generation;he had a millionnaire grandfather and a rather aloof father with whom he didn't really communicate.He led a rather easy going life until he finally decided at the age of 37 to let his talent bloom on BROADWAY.There is considerable irony to the fact that from his riding accident in 1937,that man who had everything suffered a great deal until his death in 1964.You end up knowing what was this thing called love.
