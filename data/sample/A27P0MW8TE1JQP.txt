Comparing this Batman film to the previous 4 intiated by Tim Burton in '89 would be like comparing Gotham Apples to Metropolis Oranges. But...the darkness Burton opened with in his first film, is surpassed here by this extended origin tale. Although, no obvious influence comes from Frank Miller graphic novel storyline Batman: Year One, this is still a superior comicbook movie, which says alot since Spiderman (1 & 2) upped the bar for the genre.Bale is really believable as the driven, haunted Bruce Wayne, Caine is really believable and fun as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is believable and shrewd as Fox, Gary Oldman is believable in any role, his Pre-commish Gordan is no exception, not to mention the first time Gordan look like the comic character. Everything, including the chaotic climax rings believable, nothing seems overly impossible, in this very grounded vision of Gotham.My only complaint is the editing of the fight sequences is so intense that it is difficult to follow the action and often just plain confusing. Congrats', to all who decided for Batman NOT to end up with a girlfriend in the end. Overall, a great beginning, I look foward to more.

An "okay" 3rd Doctor (Jon Pertwee) adventure, originally broadcast in 1971, that rates higher because it is with Roger Delgado's Master (taken from the series too soon do to a tragic accident) is in it.A organic spacecraft arrives on Earth in the spirit of the 50's Sci-Fi classics, the humans are ready to blow it away. Thanks to their restrain they discover a race of beautiful, , golden aliens offering an unlimited source of energy, but in reality they are a threat too Earth, working with the Doctor's villainous nemesis the renegade a Timelord called the Master. Will the exiled Doctor uncover the truth about the alien plan and aide Humanity or has is his desire for the freedom to leave Earth overcome him? judgment? Has the Doctor joined forces with his old adversary only to serve his own agenda?Surrounded by "the Brig" and his trigger-happy UNIT soldiers, self-inflated, self-serving bureaucrats, not to mention the cartoon locals, all reacting true to type, it's no wonder the Doctor seems to be torn between allies. There's lots of great sets, monsters, alien transformation into some top-notch costumes (that were so expensive they were saved and reused in "The Seeds of Doom," among others). Some of the scenes with the Doctor and the Master in the final episodes are very good, and completely sell the idea that the Doctor may have traded sides, because he was always on "his own side" to begin with.

DWM is published by MARVEL COMIC UK so there is always a 4 or 6 part comic strip, currently featuring the 10th Doctor and Rose.If love the series this is the best publication on the market related to the series, although DreamWatch is easier to find at a Barnes and Nobles, but you might get only one Dr. Who article in it. DWM runs about $7.99 cover (apart from AMAZON), publishing 13 magazines per year (there's an ANNUAL special), you can special order issues without a subscription at some bookstores or most comicbook shops. That's actually $113. 87 after tax, so for convenience (17 dollars of convenience, sir), the Amazon subscription at $130.73 maybe the choice for you or one at a time somewhere else, either way it's a great mag.

The return of an old enemy, the threat of annihilation of all life on Earth, and actual death of a compianion, Earthshock finds the 5th and youngest Doctor, PETER DAVISON at his best in this 4 parter. He displays the same short temper and irritable nature as his first incarnation along with the humanity and vulnerability of the 2nd Doctor. This excellent 19th season story arc contains one of the most emotionally powerful finale in the show's original 26-year run. A scientific expedition in a cave system on 25th-century Earth is wiped out. An military rescue unit led by Lieutenant Scott (James Warwick) and sole expedition survivor Professor Kyle (Claire Clifford) go in to recover the bodies following a mysterious massacre, developing into tense action on a space freighter bound for Earth carrying a deadly cargo of Cybermen, absent from the series for 7 years (since Tom Baker's first season ( "Revenge of the Cybermen"). At the time the return was kept fair secret, as death of a regular character, by the time it aired in the US, both cats were out of the bag (which made the "near misses" even more effective than your usual Dr. Who story).With a moody dark mood remnisent of the movie ALIEN, and WITH action & Tight-pacing reminiscent of the movie ALIENS (which it predates), doesn't lead time to include some of the camp-moments sometimes blighting the series in the `80s, and with a notable, but over-the-top guest turn from Beryl Reid as the ship's captain, Earthshock is one of the 5th Doctor's finest adventures (along with "Caves of Androzani"). Another problem of the 5th Doctors run is neatly solved, on many levels, the overfull TARDIS crew. Nyssa (and some guest-stars) being sidelined in the TARDIS for half of this very story since there is nothing for her to do illustrates why one companion had to go, and I think that the killing off of a companion was a bold and brilliant move by producer JNT. It defies reason, even in a fantasy series to have the Doctor's companions all survive and for them to be victorious in every episode. Plus, as the character everybody (at the time) loved to hate does die, in so heroic a fashion, it redeems his irksome character ( an infinitely superior end compared to sparing Westley Crusher in ST:TNG).The story is first-class enough to overlook a few plot holes and by the end they simply won't matter; when the final credits roll in silence the effect is as powerful now as it was shocking to audiences back in 1981. The ending is brilliant. It's shocking, it's moving; it's just fantastic. The credits roll silently over Adric's destroyed badge, and you realise that the Doctor doesn't always win, and it makes you love him even more. From this point on in the fifth Doctor's era, there is the feeling that no one is safe...Doctor Who: Earthshock is presented in the original broadcast with a near-flawless picture. The extras begin with a strong 32-minute documentary, more retrospective than making-of. Then comes the commentary, with the complete TARDIS crew!:Peter Davison, Janet Fielding (Tegan), Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) and Matthew Waterhouse (Adric). It is much better than the Visitation commentary, although only Davison seems to know what his talking about, while the other cast members seem to remember very little, with Fielding enthralled by the fashion aspects of the crew. Both commentary and the episodes have optional subtitles. The documentary, "Putting the `Shock' Into Earthshock" is one of the most interesting produced thus far, featuring contributions from the cast & director Peter Grimwade, writer Eric Saward, Mark Gatiss, Steve Moffatt and others. Other special feature options include detailed on-screen information subtitles, an isolated musical score, and the ability to watch Earthshock with the original FX or with selected effects shots replaced with new computer graphics (don't worry it is very subtle but very effective, perfect for showing to someone who started watching in 2005). There's a scored, five-minute photo gallery that even includes a shot from the recording of the commentary, assemblage of footage shot on film and a 10-minute section "Did You See?" which looks back on the 40 year-old show's aliens.There are DVD 'Easter Eggs,' if you navigate down to the special features option on the first menu and press select, then move down to the 40th Anniversary Celebration option and hit left to highlight a hidden Doctor Who logo then hit select, you'll get a comedy sketch featuring a short clip from "Earthshock" that's been dubbed.Possible DW drinking games: (drink when you see the following cliches or counter-cliches)-The TARDIS Crew are Accused / Arrested (for murder)-The TARDIS Crew return / plan to return to the TARDIS-Threats & near misses on TARDIS Crew-Emotionless Cybermen showing emotion-The Doctor kills-ADRIC complains

Script to screen there are bound to be differences, with a film of the scale of Star Wars Episode III., possibly more so. But, Lucas has such a clear vision of what he wants from the beginning of his projects that the book adaptations tend to differ very little from the film (as with the last two text installments). Matthew Stover's Revenge of the Sith thankfully does contain these subtle differences that make novelizations interesting to read, before or after you've see the film. The dialogue in the movie is at times brilliant and rewarding for fans (both old and new), other times painfully awkward (like the best example of the worst): "...she's loss the will to live" OH, PLEASE! We love Lucas like a great-Uncle, but a hard-headed great-Uncle. Stover's dialog can be more moving and comfortable than the screens, Anakin's return to Padme' following Palpatine's rescue, for example, is very different moment in this text. Another treat in the text is Stover's tie-ins to some of his previous Star Wars novels like Shatterpoint, which focuses on Windu, giving the author a unique perspective on the Jedi Master's thoughts and motivations. Definitely recommended summer reading, but much of the ship & saber-action contained in both, needs to be seen. So read it, then see it, or see it, then read it.

When I heard that triple Oscar winner Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson was choosing to remake KING KONG as he next endeavor, I cringed. I wondered what another remake could offer the story or theater audiences. Although, on a selfish note, I just want him to get cracking on "The Hobbit." But, I wondered, why make a remake when remakes almost always disappoint, look at Mighty Joe Young's remake. For these reasons, I decided, that I was not interested in seeing a new King Kong movie. But, upon seeing the trailer, then the film, I reevaluated my position....... I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ART, BUT I LIKE IT...scratch that...IT IS ART!Setting the movie in the 1930's, like Merian C. Cooper's original, was the right choice, it allows for an instant homage, it creates amazing costuming opportunities (like any period piece) and hedges bets on the story. The screenwriters can use genre archetypes to their heart's content and it will not be dubbed as clich&eacute;. But, the plain fact of the matter is that no amount of CGI gloss could have gotten me or mainstream audiences to see a King Kong remake in a modern setting. This movie like it predecessor, is clearly a milestone in greatfilm-making, generating the awe in film audiences I imagine they experience upon seeing Kong in 1933....Good job Mr. Jackson.Jackson re-teams here with his Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, co-writing the screenplay with three-time Oscar winning partner Walsh and their LOTR co-writer, Academy Award winner Boyens. Jackson all reunites with Andy Serkis (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provided both on-set performance reference and motion capture performance for the title character of King Kong. Serkis also appears onscreen playing Lumpy the cook, in service aboard the steamer Venture, bound for Skull Island. Serkis' very "HUMAN" range of facial expressions are brilliantly matched by the digital talents of the CGI team (I hope they both get Oscars). Leading lady Naomi Watts, plays leading lady Ann Darrow, to Jack Black's documentary-maker Carl Denham, along with Adrien Brody as the heroic Jack Driscoll. James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) composed the dynamic, original score for the film. The film is just over 3 hours running time. I guess we'll have to wait for the EXTENDED EDITION to see that missing hour and a half, they don't call him Lord of the Epics, for naught.Oh, the story, right... as if you didn't already know. Okay, while making a movie on Skull Island the crew blunders into the 7th wonder of the world a giant gorilla named King Kong, they export him to NYC, he "falls" for the leading lady and in the great tradition of mega movie-star couples, it ends tragically. `kay. Like the original it isn't reel-to-reel giant ape, there's action, adventure, dinosaurs, and a strange, love-triangleJackson, could have followed his Oscar winning trilogy with his pick of any project at all and the Industry would have bought it. He choose King Kong, because, like Lord of the Rings, it was something he wanted to do, something that meant something to him. Kong like LOTR, was a LABOR OF LOVE, and ....IT SHOWS.THE KING has left the building (the hard way)

You may have heard the theory that "only the even Trek films are good" ST:TMP is an odd # and it is a weak ST film. It is important because it was a reuniting of the TV cast (in fact the picture almost starts like the Magnificent Seven collecting bridge crew vets), and the Big budget take on the show was worth the effort... It may take it self too seriously at times, especially in the extended cut, and the beauty passes of the Enterprise seem endless as do the V'Ger clould/ sphincter shots, and the story is sort of a recycled script (Changling)... but I fondly remember seeing this in the theater.

Zathura propels the audience and two squabbling siblings into deep space while playing a mysterious board game. The live-action film is based on Chris Van Allsburg's 2002 follow-up to his award-winning Jumanji. Brothers Danny and Walter's combative relationship is established immediately along with a four-letter word, which is more jarring given the young age of the film's target audience. Zathura is rated PG, but considering the overall family tone of the film, the line is awkward at best. Tim Robbins plays the inefficient dad who appears only long enough to leave Danny and Walter in the problematic care of the sleeping older sister. After this not-entirely, unnecessary, initial exposition the movie is remarkably fast-paced leaving little need to think too hard about the physics or lackthereof. One cool effect is followed another as the brothers take their turns to make matters worse, one card after the next, just like Jumanji and its movie adaptation. And like Jumanji there is an adult who shows up in the form of an astronaut, played by Dax Shephard, to help end the game before the house is entirely wrecked by the barrage of black holes and bad robots. The astronauts presence, not only gives the parents a character to connect too, but creates a much more interesting dynamic between the brothers. The game itself is nicely sci-fi retro, as are the sci-fi scenarios, the art direction and the music.A mostly harmless family film which looks as pretty as Chris Van Allsburg's artwork (too bad he didn't add color to HIS Zathura).Watch for the "Citizen Kane" homage in the alien ship.

As cool as this set is it saddens me to think that this is the end of the line for this great series from "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening. Ofcourse, you can watch reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, I highly recommend buying this dvd set and the previous 3 volumes for yourself. Upon doing so you will find that not only do you have one of the best animated sit-coms/sci-fi spoofs ever created, but a dvd set with the coolest extras ever installed into the medium. For example, once you watch any episode with the audio commentary "on" you will never be satisfied with another non-Futurama dvd commentary again. Matt Groening, along with voice talent from the series, and other co-creators are so funny you will actually use this audio option over-and-over again. And every episode has a commentary not just one or two like some series sets.Now about the show, it self, what can I tell that you don't already know. It is super! Irreverent and like "The Simpsons" it became better with each passing season. Treat yourself, go on you deserve it.

Based on Graysmiths novels Zodiac tells the story of the press-obsessed self-proclaimed "Zodiac Killer." Zodiac isn't just the story of the hunt for the killer, but an exploration of many characters obsessed and/or involved with the long cold case: Cartoonist turned-writer-detective Robert Graysmith is played with quirky excellence by Jake Gyllenhaal; Robert Downey Jr. is brillant as the self-absorbed strung-out reporter Paul Avery who tries help crack the Zodiac's code, Mark Ruffalo plays Detective Dave Toschi ( the inspiration for Steve McQueen)seek out the identity of the killer along with his partner played by Anthony Edwards.The movie doesn't just focus on the killer, or even the search for him, but the details of period, and their lives. Like UK TV series "Life on Mars" the stark difference between present-day police procedure and the 70's. This is defined neatly by a scene in which Edwards character struggles to coordinate their efforts with other law enforcement districts. Also the obsession nearly causes Graysmith to lose his family.I don't usually go for the "based on a true-story" type of movie or crime dramas based on actual events, but I thought this one was superb. I enjoyed seeing some of the disconnected details tie together, like the Dirty Harry homage as the real players are invited to a special San Fran's Finest screening.

One-Upmanship is back!If you tolerated ROADTRIP, if you found OLD SCHOOL moderately entertaining then you might consider "SCOUNDRELS." Director Todd Phillips, this time assembles Billy Bob Thornton (of BAD SANTA) and Jon Heder (of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE and BENCHWARMERS) for this remake of Robert Hamer's 1960 screen version of Stephen Potter's series of One-Upmanship or Lifemanship books outlining how to win without actually cheating (check them out, written a century ago but still classics).Heder is Roger NYC meter maid so cowardly he pays the tickets he rights! He can't find it in himself to as out his lovely neighbor Amanda (Jacinda Barrett, of Poseidon). He is refered to enroll in a course converting losers to lions with the ladies, taught by Thornton's Dr. P with the burly assist of Michael Clarke Duncan as Lesher. Other mama's boy misfits enrolled are a "whipped" Horatio Sanz, Matt Walsh and Todd Louiso's obligatory virgin. After Roger proves himself too good a student, Dr. P wants to seduce Amanda to prove he is still in charge, then the One-upmanship begins this-time school is out and student is a master, sortof.The theme is as classic and as familiar as the books themselves. So are the punchlines. Heder and Thornton (who even takes a shot at ex-Jolie) keep the goofs coming, Ben Stiller adds to the hilarity all too briefly. Overall, sort of mild considering the salsa from Phillips in the past.

What a great start for what I hope is a long running series. Great pacing, tightly plotted with enough reveals with conceals, a satisfyiing story arc / season finale. Great casting! Lots of fresh faces along with lots of familar ones.The THEME: What if some everyday folks suddenly became superpowered in the "real world?" What if these people's origins, though seemingly random, were very much connected? And "How do you stop a man from exploding (along with a bunch of NYC)?If you didn't see it there's alot more to it than those questions. Lots of drama, some cool effects and plenty of humor too.The 9th Wonders is a fictional comic that parallels the events of the characters in the series, partly because it's creator Isaac Mendez (SANTIAGO CABRERA)is an artist who can paint the future. This ability eventually joins these seemingly random group of heroes and villans together to resolve the fate of the city, and maybe, THE WORLD!The series won plenty of respect from NBC along with award from the likes of the American Film Institute for Best TV Program of the Year, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a Golden Globe (for Best TV Drama), the Peoples Choice, and others.In fact, the NAACP acknowledged the series for its efforts, and well it should, the cast is amazingly diverse in race and gender(but science-fiction and fantasy has always been ahead of the game there).The archetypes roll out, but rarely take the obvious paths. Several character story threads are ultimately all entwined. Like that of Hiro Nakamura's lovable Japanese geek who can bend time & space (Masi Oka)and his powerless but loyal friend. Or Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia)the power-absorbing male nurse who may be the cause or the solution of the problems to be, and his flying politician brother (played by Adrian Pasdar or Top Gun & Profit). The brainy (but likable) Micah Sanders and his "super" disfuntional family, Niki, a mentally split super-assassin/super-stripper mom and the phazing ex-con dad. The invunerable Cheerleader Claire Bennet who's past and present has been puppetmastered by dark forces. The would-be police detective with mind-reading powers and young Dr. Suresh seeking not only to finish his father's work, finding these "heroes," but stopping his father's killer. But who are the "heroes" and who are the villians? And what of the murderous watchmaker Sylar?In typical soap fashion, even the ugly characters are interesting to look at. Eric Roberts, Malcom McDowell and Zachary Quinto appear as baddies in this charter season. Other cameos include George Takei as Hiro's father.Watch for the 6 episode spinoff / filler series on NBC "Heroes: Origins" that will introduce a new superpowered character each week, viewers will select who makes it to the second season of Heroes.

Tim Burton's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is nicely Roald Dahlish, while making Wonka's backstory nicely Burtonish. Another touch only Burton would have done is the casting of Johnny Depp as a pasty, androgynous Wonka with disturbing similarities to Michael Jackson (Depp and the boy were in NEVERLAND together, for crying-out-loud!!), who was still in the news at the time of the film's theater release. Depp, as always, is kooky, great fun to watch. Freddie Highmore is a fine Charlie B. Infact, all the casting is superb, Grandpa Joe is prefect! Deep Roy as all of the Oompa Loompas really is the best feature of the feature.Some of Dahl's more technically difficult scenes make it into this version, like the Chocolate Palace and the factory squirrels. The film contains a more solid end than the original, or the book (which hooks into the sequel "Charlie and Glass Elevator." Burton stays safely away from the 34 year-old classic, as Depp avoids any immiation of Wilder's performance.The film is good family fair, if over-grand "eye-candy."

Torchwood is the most-times dark, sometimes gory, adult tie-in to the new Doctor Who series, but that hardly matters as it is the most unique TV you'll ever see. ..Dr. Who producer & two-time Hugo-nominated writer Russell T. Davies created the series as an opportunity to do more than just family fare, part CSI, part X-files and the remaining part is out there on its own. In Dr. Who there have been hidden references to the "secret" organization TORCHWOOD (the name which is an anagram of DOCTOR WHO) since season one (an answer given by the ANNE DROID in BAD WOLF episode 12 ), then appearing more physically throughout season two, even featuring the origin of the organization created by Queen Victorian herself to defend the Earth from alien threats, including The Doctor. The series takes place over a hundred years later as Jack says on the promos, "In the 21st century, everything changes." Captain Jack Harkness (played BRILLIANTLY by the dashing John Barrowman, best known to Americans as the singing Nazi lead in the "Springtime for Hitler" number in the Producers musical) is a character introduced during season one of Dr. Who, an ex-time agent, con-man, the Doctor & Rose meet in the 1940's and turn towards the path of good and righteousness, well almost.Jack is originally from the 51st century, which is intended to explain his oversexed ways (i.e. he is very liberal in who he "SNOGS"& "SHAGS" ) His background is really complex, even before he meets the Doctor, but he is missing some of his memories from his time as a time-agent, during the "Parting of the Ways" the first season finale of Dr. Who his character becomes even more interesting, but I won't say more without spoiler warnings.I know I've referenced Dr. Who, a lot, but WATCHING DR. WHO IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ENJOYING TORCHWOOD, MERELY A BONUS. There is a level to Torchwood that is directed at DW fans, but it isn't obtrusive. The initial season of Torchwood begins introducing the viewer to its world through the eyes of Gwen, a low-rung Cardiff lady cop, eventually becomes part of a jaded almost amoral group that uses scavenged alien-tech to protect the world from future threats. The neophyte member eventually serves as catalysis to re-humanize the team. But the dynamic of the characters is one of abrasiveness, deceit, love and lust. The major players are far from perfect, by the end of the season, most of the team have done things both unexpected and at times alarming.Most of the performances are great to watch, much Americanized, gritty acting. Gwen, played by Eve Myles, who oddly enough played a Victorian servant girl named Gwyneth who opens the closes the very rift Torchwood is build on in Dr. Who season 1. Gwen is an earthy attractive but not unrealistically so, as are most of the players, except Jack, of course, who is over-the-top silver-screen good looking, which is perfect for his over-the-top fearless-leader-with-a-mysterious-past archetype.Torchwood is very stylish, lots of aerial shots of building in Cardiff, the Welsh city where the series is filmed and most of the action takes place. Its waterside features remind me of New Orleans. Another anchor location of the show in Cardiff is soooo appropriately the Roald Dahl Plaza (Carciff-born creator of Willy Wonka) it would naturally hold a time-space rift and the headquarters of a secret organization under the fountain where it can monitor extra-terrestrial traffic through the rift. Kind of a sexed up Men in Black, except no one wears black, well ok Iantos does, but he's more of a case manager type. The series music co-composed by Dr. Who's Murray Gold is both edgy and original. As is the special effects and make-up. In the pilot episode, the make-up on the Weevil, a reoccurring species, is so good that a long scene is shot in full-light with Gwen and another character studying the creature. That is how confident and bold the makers of Torchwood are! The series won a BEST DRAMA SERIES BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts), besting Doctor Who season 2 in the category and first episodes gave BBC 3 its highest ratings ever. One series flaw is that Torchwood is meant to be very covert, but they also seem to be high profile "special ops," other than that amusing conflict, I love the series and think that many Americans who may have never watched any British TV before, will be hooked!The episode guide that follows may have some MINOR SPOILERS, okay?#1 "Everything Changes"This is a good one, I give it 9 out of 10, it is one of the best series pilots I've seen. Unlike some series openers, it seems familiar with characters and where they are going, there's no early season one awkwardness here, INFACT, Eve Myles WON a "BEST-ACTRESS" BAFTA (Wales) for this one, John Barrowman got a nom...Episode Synopsis:South Wales coffee makin' cop Gwen Cooper is at the scene of a murder when Torchwood shows, Gwen snoops on the group and sees in a disturbing scene in which the victim is temporally resurrected, then questioned. She starts her own investigation to learn more, and ends up meeting an alien and literally going underground unsuccessfully disguised as a pizza-girl, joins up and then things get weird....#2 Day OneThis one is less good, but is all about the fact that Torchwood is an adult series and begins to set some boundaries. Even so, this one has a great pre-titles scene with Gwen & her boyfriend, and a great opening line...7 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:The title says it all...it is Gwen's first day on the job, and because of her obligatory noob screw up she unwittingly unleashes a hot-sex-addicted-alien....no REALLY...this one is about AN ALIEN WHO SHAGS HER WAY THROUGH THE EPISODE...it seems like a Captain Jack natural. There are some great moments and some great lude dialogue, like following the discovery of the alien's nature and the disintegrated remains of its first partner, Harkness remarks that the guy "came and went, at the same time." More lines like that and hot-girl-on-alien action...#3 Ghost MachineThis one is spooky and provides some insights into the gruff team member Owen's character. Usually, so far, Owen, played by Burn Gorman, isn't the sort to get involved or outwardly show his real feelings, in the series thus far, he has deflected them and given Gwen and the others attitude to cover. This time, due to his unique interaction with the machine, he is very open and driven.... 8 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:The team retrieve an alien artifact that shows ghost images of the past, thus allowing Owen to witnesses a girl's murder some forty years before. He becomes obsessed with bring the murderer to justice, while Gwen tries to stop future projections from occurring as well.#4 CyberwomanThis one may be too much for the Dr. Who fans, but you need not know the back-story to appreciate the story, but it helps to forgive the nature of the story that seems awkward when compared to the rest of the season. The Cybermen, humans converted from a parallel Earth, were all meant to be destroyed at another Torchwood base on this Earth, this is the exception. This time a half converted erotic-cyborg with more gruesome conversion effects and other creepiness, oh and Cyberwoman vs. the pterodactyl...did I mention they have a pterodactyl in the Torchwood HQ...7.5 out of 10 for this one...Episode Synopsis:Ianto, played by Gareth David-Lloyd who is sort of the teams Alfred the Butler, managing the Batcave, has hidden what's left of his girlfriend at Torchwood. His plans to get outside help end with the entire team at risk of finding themselves converted or worse!#5 Small WorldsThis one is creepy, if a little predictable, take something inherently cute and friendly, like say fairies, and make them dangerous, powerful and a little homicidal, throw in a spooky little girl, an old girl friend of Jack's er... Dad...and you have a winning mix, 8.5 out of 10 for this one....Episode Synopsis:Jack's senior friend has discovered fairies in a nearby wood, while Torchwood uncovers a mysterious jail death and weird weather bursts. Jack sees a pattern connected to his mysterious past....#6 CountrycideThis one is grisly, edgy and very frightening, playing-out like a mainstream horror movie, a good one! This one isn't for the squeamish. ...9 out of 10 for Countrycide...Episode Synopsis:Deaths in the middle of nowhere split up the team, Gwen and Owen find themselves in another tight situation, a survivor hides from the killer, Tech-chick Tosh and Ianto race against the clock, and the team fight to stay off the menu.#7 Greeks Bearing GiftsThis one isn't the best of the season, but it does give more development to Tosh's character...6.5 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:Tosh gets a strange pendant from a strange woman and she gains the strange ability to read minds. In the process learning way more than just casual thoughts, in order to make things right Tosh must get this woman into Torchwood H.Q.#8 They keep killing SuzieThis is a great one...disturbing and well written, a fallen Torchwood member returns providing a unique opportunity to deal with the consequences of events in the pilot episode. A great exploration of Gwen and her place in Torchwood... I give it 9.5 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:The "Resurrection-Gauntlet" was classified as too dangerous to continue experimenting with, but a link to pre-pilot events, force the team to use the gauntlet on a deceased Torchwood member. The process goes wrong and events go from bad to worse#9 Random ShoesAnother surprisingly good story, most of the regular team is sideline for much of this one as it's point of view is from a deceased peripheral character, like Dr. Who's B team stories (used for shooting two shows simultaneously ), it brilliantly features an outsider's view of the team, more outside than even Gwen's episode one intro...9 out of 10...the end is a bit sappy...Episode Synopsis:Eugene Jones learns that he has been the victim of a hit-and-run and is dead. He retracing his "steps" leading up to his death, including his interaction with the Torchwood team and what he believed was an alien artifact, while Gwen is the unwitting partner in the same investigation.#10 Out of TimeThis one is a weak one, "the fish out of water/ romance that can never be," great pre-title opening with the Team on hand as a temporally -displaced plane touches down on an airstrip, mostly-predictable and unnecessarily sappy...7 out of 10...Episode Synopsis:Three stangers from the early 50's are trapped in present-day Cardiff, after flying from the Rift. Torchwood helps each of the them deal with making a new life, one way or another and Owen gets serious with one.#11 CombatThis one is written by Noel Clarke a.k.a Mickey Smith, really. You've asked for it, you got it! The Weevil Fight Club!

Owen goes undercover to find out.#12 Captain Jack HarknessWarning this one is not for the homophobic; Jack is particularly randy in this one. There's loads of drama and amazing acting in this one, although a visually limited view of the WWII era, the character of Bilis Manger, mysterious time-walker, is fascinating to watch as he manipulates the staff in this episode and the next, played by Murray Melvin (who could play William Hartnell if they every need him). .. 9.5 out of 10Episode Synopsis:Jack and Tosh are transported to the 1940s, during the Blitz where they meet another Captain Jack Harkness and it isn't Jack. The rest of the team go in search of decades old clues Jack and Tosh may have left.( Watch for the "Vote Saxon" posters in this one. A Dr. Who series 3 ref.)#13 End of DaysTightly following the events in the last episode, all hell breaks loose, literally as the mysterious Mr. Bilis plans for the Rift continue with it wide enough to release the deity he worships.

Much Darker... No pun intended. The shortened more graphic 1970 film version of Barnabas' story arc from the TV series.ABC's supernatural soap which ran from 1966-71 with 1000+ episodes (by Dan Curtis) ... Intended to be a Wuthering Heights-like drama. Most of the cast of the original actors from TV reprise their roles. Like the delightfully Jonathan Frid (who we lost this year). Awoken by treasure hunter/madman Willie Loomis, 200 year old Barnabas Collins goes on a killing spree, takes a bride, almost gets cured of vampirism... My only complaint about this film is: 'there's no Angelique' until sequel Night of Dark Shadows also out as of Oct 30th as well but then there's no Barnabas) Story goes lightning fast by comparison 22 mins in and Cousin Barnabas is back in the Old House and shopping for a new Josette. The nearly 50 year old concept is surprisingly timely now that the period supernaturals (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies) are so hip...

The third film in the action franchise loosely based on a TV series best remembered for its cool theme music and a self-destructing message shtick. The John Woo is replaced as director by the red-hot TV bred creator of ALIAS and LOST, J.J.ABRAMS. Super-spy This one opens with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) being tortured, threatened by a villain looking for "the rabbit's foot." has retired from active duty to trains new IMF agents. But he is called back into action to confront the toughest villain he's ever faced .....AN OSCAR WINNER!!! ...Philip Seymour Hoffman ( from Capote) plays Owen Davian, an international arms and information provider with no remorse and no conscience. He implants time-release explosives in his victim's brains. Hunt assembles his team - his old friend Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), transportation expert Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), background operative Zhen (Maggie Q), and fresh recruit Lindsey (Keri Russell) - to travel the globe pursuing Davian and rescue Hunt's love, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Laurence Fishburne is on board as an agency head with all the good lines! Hunt's agency has a "mole" that sets him up as a rogue agent, both hunting Davian as well as being hunted by his own. The film later flashes back to reveal how Hunt ends up tied up, we learn he isn't supposed to be in the field, he's supposed to be getting married, he has a good cover as a Virginia Dept. of Transportation employee. We also learn that he has rejoined his team to rescue a captured prot?g? played by Keri Russell, then complete her mission.Better than the first two. All the MI iconic imagery is here: The identity-switching mask, the glamorous locales (ROME, BERLIN, & SHANGHAI, the pulse racing logic defying stunts (skyscraper jump and truck , and the now classic SPY-on-a-Wire staple. What has been kick up a notch is the cruel violence, the team's lack of respect for Hunt's dream of a normal life, and the brutality of the beatings Hunt gets. The high-tech action really is non-stop, and there are no cliched love scenes slowing things down, probably because of the lack of chemistry between Cruise and the Michelle Monaghan, playing "THE WOMAN he LOVES who DOESN'T KNOW WHAT he DOES." The plot moves quickly but it doesn't lose the audience at all, MI: III works as a completely separate piece with no need for prior knowledge of Hunt or his history in the previous movies. There are some generic action MOMENTS, but it does everything an action movie should do, and does it very well. I would highly advise anyone who likes action movies to go see it. Even if you think Tom Cruise is nuts, MI:III is extremely enjoyable and thanks to J.J. Abrams, surprisingly fresh.

I remember my joy at finding this in a grocery store after the first star wars thinking it was the sequel to be ( because Vader and luke were on the cover, I don't think it actuall said Star Wars on the first run) as it happens Lucas hired Foster to write a potentially low budget follow up to New Hope in case the first was not a Financial success and he needed to continue with little or no studio backing. The universe feels streamlined too, no Han or Chewy, and Luke and Leia's behavior may seem creepy in hindsight . This may not be as easily canon as other SW books of late, but a must read for the fan.

The Doctor arrives at Heathrow Airport, only it's a few centuries too early, have the TARDIS and crew materializing just as the Plague is ravaging England. As the mystery unfolds, we learn that stranded reptilian-aliens, who are also escaped convicts, are accelerating the Plague in a typical half-baked fashion. As the newly regenerated 5th Doctor, played here by young Peter Davison, joins forces with Richard Mace, an actor turned highwayman. Keeping in the classic mold of the series, there is lots of running, capture, escape and escaping again, but very little story to tie up the historical elements.Significant story points: THE DEATH of the SONIC SCREWDRIVER(don't worry kids, it'll be back, check out the new season one DVDs in July)With so many companions in the TARDIS a common flaw with the first Davison season is trying to find something for everyone to do, this is partly why Nyssa ends up in the TARDIS on a superfluous tech detail. Inspite of this I am still disappointed when Michael Robbins's Richard Mace remains behind, rather than add another mouth the feed (in the dialogue sense). The costumes are awkward, but performances bridge the gap. Locations are ok here and Peter Davison is so charming on screen that this below average concept becomes a very watchable piece of Dr. Who history. Unfortunately, Davison is less charismatic on the DVD commentary, filled with pauses and no real revelations, making for a is a less than interesting extra.

With the success of the BBC's Sarah Jane Adventures (UK series targeted for younger viewers)and the pending 2008 return of the Sontaran's to the 4th season of Doctor Who it is a great time for the DVD release of the "Time Warrior." Not only was the story a season opener and the 3rd Doctor's final season played by the groovy Judo-chopping Jon Pertwee, but it introduces one of the Doctor's finest companions Sarah Jane Smith as played by Elisabeth Sladen. Sarah returned to say her farewells in season 2 of the 2006 Dr. Who only to get her own CBBC spin-off.The Story: England's scientists are being snatched and transported to the middle-ages by a stranded alien. UNIT asks the Doctor to sort it out, while the lovely and plucky young reporter Miss Sarah Jane Smith stows-away on the TARDIS as the Doctor tracks the scientists into the past. Ultimately, Sarah ends up at odds with the Doctor believing he is the time-napping villain and teaming-up with a local King and Queen to storm the baddies castle. Eventually, the two ally themselves to face the true foes, including the war-mongering armored Sontaran supplying the locals with centuries advanced weaponry.Some neat moments are the introduction of a "fighting mechnical-man" to the middle-age tyrant in which an archer stays his execution by pumping arrows in to the machine as it continues to march ever forward. A scene which is repeated later with sword and axe-play as the Doctor is disquised as the robot.The action in this one is typical of Pertwee's years, as is the over-the-top writing for the late great Robert Holmes, especially dialogue for Bloodaxe and his minions, who in one scene refer to the Doctor as a "Long-shanked rascal with a mighty nose!" The strength of the original series has always been the great location work giving the long running sci-fi fantasy series a grounding in the real world, the nearly 35 year old episode was filmed at a real castle, Peckforton Castle. The on-screen chemistry between the Doctor and Sarah certainly foreshadows the highlights to come in the shows future, even in these formative stages of character development Sladen is a joy to watch and is my favorite companion (follow closely by Billie Piper ofcourse). New fans of the series will appreciate this "historic" meeting between Doctor and sidekick.The DVD has lots of extras and easter eggs, including OPTIONAL CGI SPECIAL EFFECTS to bring the 1973 story visually up-to-date, if you chose. Since the History of the Sontarans Documentary was included in the Sontaran Experiment DVD, "Beginning the End" talks with cast, producers and script editors on location at Peckforton. Extensive interviews include guest star Jeremy Bulloch who played Hal the Archer, Star Wars fans may not know his face, but are surely familiar with his name as Emipire and Jedi's original Boba Fett.

After ditching poor Captain Mike Yates, with whom Jo has a date, for a test flight of the TARDIS with the Doctor, the pair end up on a cliff face. They then scale a excellently sculpted miniature mountainside to the "Citadel of Peladon. Here they fuel a case of mistaken identity, always a great time saver (like the 2005 invention of the psychic paper), once assuming their roles of the Earth delegates the two are able to immerse themselves in the court conspiracy on a galactic scale. First, Peladon is a planet under a feudal monarchy applying for admission to "Galactic Federation" (no, not that ONE), an application with delegates from Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, and Mars are assessing whether or not to accept Peladon's entry. The good but young King Peladon is torn, his Chancellor Torbis urges towards progress, to bring the Planet from superstitions beliefs, while High Priest of Peladon Hepesh is worried that the ancient ways and traditions will lost with the Federation membership. But the mysterious murder of the Chancellor, is interpreted by the High Priest to be a sign of disapproval from the spirit of the Royal Beast of Peladon, Aggedor.In a very Agatha Christie style "drawing room mystery", we have the Good Doctor and the usual suspects or delegates. Interestingly enough some bigotry influences the Doc's judgment. The Doctor immediately suspects Ice Lord Izlyr, let's be fair, the Ice Warriors in all previous encounters HAVE attempted world domination. So when someone attacks the Arcturus delegate, and some superficial evidence also pointing to this, the Doctor is onboard with the theory. Meanwhile an equal mistrust of the Ice Warriors themselves towards "Princess" Jo evolves inpart because of the young King Peladon's instant attraction for her, and partly his mother's Earthly origins (also an angle Peladon uses to talk game to Jo), also in their eyes any possible union gives unfair political weight in Federation affairs. All are but pawns in some devious political game...What sinster secret lays behind the killings? Is Aggedor seeking his revenge? Maybe, But more importantly, Jon Pertwee's Doctor is at his best here as the courtly King's counselor filling the void left by Torbis' death, lending his sagely advise to an inexperienced king. Also coming to DVD for May the improved sequel aired the following season The Monster of Peladon, in which the Doctor an Sarah return 50 years later to more treacherous plots.Influences of this story arc, other than Shakespeare's histories there are strong similarities to the Classic Star Trek episode "Journey to Babel." In turn it may have influenced some Babylon 5 stories as well.Another important (atleast to me) note: the voice of Alpha Centauri played by Ysanne Churchman worked as an actress on British radio, TV and film (returns as the Voice of Alpha Centauri in The Monster of Peladon and to voice the Spiders in Planet of the Spiders). She is my favorite thing about all three stories, de-lightful!Great bits.... Delagate from Alpha Centauri's high pitched voice may be nearly enough to distract away from the fact that the costume looks like a man-sized one-eyed-member...other high points...the Doc sings the "monster" Aggedor to sleep, the "Venusian" lullaby the Doctor uses in The Daemons. Here, the Doctor uses the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"Another neat fact David Troughton, young King Peladon here, is really the son of the second Doctor, the late Patrick Troughton, but you'd know him as the Prof. in season four's MIDNIGHT, if they new series ever needs a 2nd Doctor stand-in, David is perfect (with a wig & a recorder).Peladon Drinking Game.....Drink whenever:-King Peladon flirts with Princess Josephine of TARDIS.-King Peladon proposes to Princess Josephine of TARDIS-Princess Josephine of TARDIS spurns said flirting & proposal attempts.-The Doctor calls someone "Old Chap" or "My Dear Fellow."-The Doctor or Jo are accused of murder or threatened with execution or just "seized"(it happens quite a lot in these stories, doesn't it? )-The King is taken hostage.-ALPHA CENTAURI speaks (let's face it, that voice! You gotta have a drink!)-Aggedor shows up, whether it be to maul or purr (shrine statues count, too)..."Here's to Aggedor....cheers!"

Everyone is gonna love the Bond they grew up with , both literally and figuratively, for some it will always be Connery or Moore. Each have their take on the role. But, rarely to you get the cold, hard and dangerous killer from the novels. The first Connery Dr. No, has Bond with no Q or gadgets, floating naked silhouettes and less wordplay than later films that better fit what we've come to expect from a movie Bond. When these 'Trademarks' are missing some purists become disgruntled. Royale does what could have been done when Brosnan took over, start over with the original novel and the first adventure with Bond. Overdue due to rights issues, one of the best, rawest 007 tales has never been done (seriously) to date (the '67 spoof and '54 American TV movie not considered canon). What better place to invent Bond, without reinventing him at all.Daniel Craig has the rugged look of a... dare I say it... a "Connery Bond", more man than model, although he took alot of grief over his hair color. But Craig is the who can utter all the original lines, even the icy closing line of the original novel (ck it out). Dame Judi Dench is so brilliant as M I'm not bothered by the continuity problems of her becoming her own predecessor. Another notable changes to the original, is that Casino Royale's game of choice is now Texas Hold 'em instead of Baccarat, which is cool considering the book was written in '53, swapping a current game the same way that Bond movies swapped post WW II for post Cold War.The story for the uninitiated is roughly the same, a newly upgraded British intelligence operative is assigned to track a band of international terrorist. The plan is to break up the band by breaking the Banker...Le Chiffre, who compulsively gambles with the groups funds. Bond, aided by hot Treasury agent Vesper Lynd, is to play and beat him at poker, forcing him to seek goverment protection from his understandably irrate ex-clients (in exchange for their secrets).In addition to Eva Green as the first "Bond Girl", we get to see Bond's first Tux, his first Aston Martin, but probably not his first Martini.As I said this one is raw, gritty and refreshingly free of the gimmicky gadgets and supervillian plots, away from the larger than life Bond pic of the past and more firmly set in the real world than ever before (sort of).This is a solid new direction for the Bond films I can't wait for more.

The decade journey closes ( longer for those of us on board with the release of the Philosopher's Stone ). Yates , WB and the cast have done a fine job ( w/ both parts), changes from the books made were less painful than earlier film cuts, although the occasional monologuing of exposition occurs, like Harry explaining wand lore and who the elder wand belongs to... May they didn't do enough of this, even, I thought Harry's on-screen Horcrux Math was lacking, if I hadn't read the material I questioned how it was condensed here. Harry actually says " there's one Horcrux left ... I hope the less literate members of the audience could keep up with these potentially confusing leaps. That complaint aside...The scenes in this story were ready made for cinema ... Breaking into and out of the Gringott's wizard bank, which even on screen is established as the most secure place in the very first adventure. Other homages to the decade of Potter history are made ofcourse... Basilisk anyone? Again I say the cast has done a super job in making us care about these characters , good and evil for what amounts to a 16 hour experience ... Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are over the top as expected, but subtile performances are in the mix like, Dame Maggie Smith's at times elegant Prof. McGonagall portrayal, briefly many other Hogwarts cameos ( surprising how many students are still onboard from Year One). As for Harry, Ron and Hermione, they may have delivered their best work to date, but they are so comfortable with each other as with the characters that is seems pretty effortless ... Although I wonder if even they can make the distinction at this point .... Mischief Managed, y'all .

It's hard to believe that the Zucker Brothers have been consistently making us laugh since the 70's with their writing/directing initially with the KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, then beginning their long-time (brilliant) collaboration with Leslie Nielsen in AIRPLANE (& II.), later with the POLICE SQUAD series and NAKED GUN film versions. The SCARY MOVIE franchise (named after the real working title for SCREAM) delivers the same MAD Magazine-style spoof , again and again. Now proving how successful this horror-satire genre is by exceeding the 3-film mark, this one maybe the best of the lot (so far).David Zucker directs this one with story by Craig Mazin, who co-wrote on previous films.Although conspicuously absent are Shawn and Marlon Wayans (as writers and characters), but on the plus side, Leslie Nielsen returns as President Harris, Y-E-S! (Don't spell in front of me!) Other returning survivor/regulars are: Anna Faris (Cindy), Regina Hall (Brenda), Simon Rex (George) and Anthony Anderson (Mahalik). What would a Zucker film be without the parade of star/celebrity cameos like: Dr. PHIL & SHAQ! Also Bill Pullman, Carmen Electra, Chingy (formerly of Ludacris' group) and Charlie Sheen ( back as Tom)Lovable, dim-witted Cindy Campbell returns having taken on a new job of house keeping. Cindy and her ego-centric, sex-crazed pal Brenda soon find a little boy had died and to learn why they once again go on a journey so twisted, that giant, alien Tri-pods are involved. They are join by Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), the cute & clueless neighbor.This one spoofs: WAR of the WORLDS, SAW 1 and 2, The VILLAGE, The GRUDGE and an extreme take on Tom Cruise's Oprah antics ( I can't begin describe how funny and deserved that mock up was) The whole movie was classic, dim-witted and laugh-out-loud hilarious. You can't go wrong with "the Zucker mark" and this one's got it!I look forward to their next project SUPERHERO! That one will be just in time to spoof the upcoming Superman release.

In this one Adam Sandler is self-absorbed architect Michael Newman who is married to the sweet and supportive Donna played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, of the UNDERWORLD films. He has 2 beautiful kids, Ben and Samantha, who he doesn't get to see much because he's working lots of overtime in an attempt to be made a partner by David Hasselhoff, his ungrateful boss. One night, tired, frustrated, unable to even figure out which remote will turn on his TV, he sets out to find a "universal remote." In an embarrassing production of product placement that would make a NASCAR driver blush, he ends up at "Bed, Bath & Beyond," specifically the "Beyond" room. Here he finds the resident eccentric genius employed there, called Morty, chiefly because Sandler loves having Christopher Walken, who plays the part, say "Morty." Morty gives him an unique experimental device to get his life under "control." Michael is now able to turn on any & all appliances with the a single "click." He gradually learns of the device's other functions: It can "MUTE" the bark of the family dog, PAUSE everything and fast forward through an argument with the Mrs. he can adjust his HUE as well. Wanting to learn more he visits "the Beyond" and Morty again. Morty tells Michael that he got exactly what he asked for "a remote to control his universe." Morty further demonstrates more features, including one that lets him flip through his existence at varying speeds. Michael is soon corrupted absolutely by the sheer power of the control, literally losing control. Before long he can't stop the remote from selecting what and when he will fast-forward, causing him to miss events he wants to experience, eventually leading the obligatory " It's A WONDERFUL LIFE" epiphany when does realize all that he's missed and sometimes it is and sometimes isn't a wonderful life, but that's okay, he gets the message and all is forgiven.The film is light formula-fare with heart, like some of Sandler's weaker films, there are laughs to be found. Sandler is okay as the nice-guy with a crude streak. Hasselhoff is fun as the jerk boss. Some of the gags get repetitive and some aren't that funny the first time. Also an over-large amount of time is spent creating the progressively older Michael Newman.Click is directed for Sandler's Happy Madison production company by Frank Coraci of the Wedding Singer, Waterboy and most recently Around the World in 80 Days (the Jackie Chan). And Sandler again uses Henry "the Fonz" Winkler (previously in the Happy Madison universe as Coach Klien, and as himself in Little Nicky) and Julie Kavner (best known as the voice of Marge Simpson) to play his unappreciated folks. If nothing else, Sandler is a loyal guy.

Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story gets a make-over, but it isn't what you'd expect. Lot's of horror, lot's of humor, plenty of over the top performances by James Nesbitt, who totally sells the potentially tired premise. A great supporting cast with equally strong performances. The writing is superb as Hugo Award-winning Steven Moffat who penned some the scariest, best written stories of the new Doctor Who series (The Empty Child, Blink) reworks Stevenson's century-old concept.Some mild spoilers follow...Much of the exposition is given in later episodes through flashbacks and some hyper-race memory, but the series opens with Dr. Tom Jackman, having left his life and family behind in a desperate attempt to protect them from his "dark side" eventually dubbed Mr. Hyde.Dr. Jackman has left is family and job. "Blackouts" lead him to hire a psychiatric nurse, played by Michelle Ryan (the new The Bionic Woman) to oversee his transformations and serving as a mediator between Hyde and Jackman. His wife, Claire played by Gina Bellman (from Coupling), has hired a private detective to find out what's going on with Tom, while he fears Hyde even learning about his family. The private detective Meera Syal (of The Kumars at No 42 a.k.a granny) accidentally reveals Tom's family to Hyde after an unscheduled change takes place. Hyde befriends Claire and the kids as "Uncle Billy." Upon his "return" Jackman learns that his family is at risk...other external forces are trying to draw Hyde out for their own covert agendas. While at the zoo with his sons along with shady family friend (played by James Lawson Star Wars' Wedge), Tom converses on his cellphone with his very awake alter-ego and literally enters the lion's den to save his son. A mystery woman, claiming to be his mother, reveals that Tom is a direct descendant of Dr Henry Jekyll, who had no heirs. Dr. Jackman flees, fighting his dark side as he may Hyde is still coming, as are the organization planning to catch him.Claire eventually learns of Hyde, confronting him demanding her husband back. But there's lots more flashbacks, reveals and twists before she'll get anything of the kind. She may have to learn dark secrets and not only about Tom.The language and mood of the series is dark and adult, but I'd recommend it, plenty of heart-pumping thriller pacing along with its grislier moments. Nesbitt's transformation into Hyde is subtle from an effects stand-point, but from an acting aspect it is rocking! Gina Bellman's performance is also stand-out good.The series has many shockingly disturbing moments, even when Hyde isn't on screen (well Nesbitt is) like... A terrifying message in Jackman's own blood on a wall, "When you sleep, I will eat your children," the children locked asphyxiating in steel caskets or just about whenever Jackman's Family is alone with Hyde.Ultimately, the truth about Jackman is revealed and it is not as unexpected as some of Hyde's actions throughout the climax of the show. Enough questions remain support a second series, hopefully with as much of the "surviving" original cast as possible.Speaking of cast, I was shocked to see that Amazon failed to list the leading actor James Nesbitt on the DVD info, I mean I love Ewan McGreggor's Uncle Wedge, but props to the man playing two roles for Pete's sake!

Finally, the release of the complete second season of the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with 13 classic episodes from the show. No more garage sale searches for me! It was fun to see these old shows again, but they are "the oranges" to the current series' "apples." While the new series more closely ties to the original comic series, the first animated series, created in part to add to action figure marketing, is a much lighter (especially the 2nd season) and condensed version. The history of the characters is geared for a younger audience, for example in "Splinter No More," sees Splinter become Hamato Yoshi again. In the 90's series Splinter is Master Yoshi mutated, rather than a pet. Also includes some classic video rental store staples: "The Return of the Shredder," "The Incredible Shrinking Turtles," "It came from Beneath the Sewers." "Teenagers from Dimension X," has teenagers from Dimension X, in it. "Invasion of the Punk Frogs," features the introduction of more mutants. "Enter: The Fly," with Dr. Stockman of the 90's, vaguely spoofs the Vincent Price fly movies. Other episodes are "New York's Shiniest" a Robocop spoof. The final episode of the season is "Return of the Technodrome," an episode in which, you guessed it, the Technodrome and Krang return to Earth.The current generation of turtle fans will still appreciate this alternate selection of episodes, it will also give them an opportunity to get many of the inside-jokes in the current series (like Krang's cameo, April's news reporter disquise).One major flaw of the DVD is the lack of special features and extras, even the games have more extras than this DVD. There is plenty of time to improve considering the large number of episodes from the 90's TMNT (over 130), still look forward to the next volume or dare I say it: Boxed set..."Life is like a box of pizza" or "Radical is as radical does."

Kermit and all the Muppets in ROBERT-LOUIS STEVENSON'S classic priate adventure TREASURE ISLAND. It has it all action-adventure-music and the string of celebrity cameos you'd expect from a Muppet movie. Surprisingly true to the text, give or take a pig or two.Young Jim Hawkins inherits a long-lost treasure map, he hires the great ship Hispaniola to seek his fortune along with Captain Smollett (Kermit the Frog) at the helm -- and Long John Silver (Tim Curry) -- they set sail for adventure only to discover danger and song numbers at every turn!The production is great, with the Muppets in top form, full of great lines from the Muppet greats. Henson would have been proud, except for Jim's first song, Curry carries him later.Featuring a swashbuckling good score by Lion King Oscar winner winner Hans Zimmer,this fully restored and remastered 50th Anniversary Edition is a must have for Muppet fans.

"I am Legend" is one of my favorite stories, it is the Grandfather of the Zombie genre, even though it is a vampire story, King and Romero have cited it as long time inspiration (King's most recent "Cell" as well,haveing been so borrowed from and seen so much film-versions already, I worried about what this latest project could bring worth retelling. But the imagery alone makes this worth seeing. The "Last Man on Earth" traveling through "real" NYC locales stark and empty while hunting CGI deer in a Muscle car is so striking, it will stay with us as moviegoers for some time to come. Like many of the moments in the film. Smith is in most every shot and spends much of the movie bouncing dialogue off dogs, dummies and the camera. He is superb in what may be his best dramatic performance yet. He sells the character clinging to the tattered shreds of normalcy, swapping DVD like rentals at the corner store, watch old newscasts, etc. Purists of the original work maybe disgruntled by the changes made to the 50 year-old classic novel, but they make the movie a tighter, stark and relevant vehicle.

Disc 1: Spongebob Squarepants:Employee of the Month is really more difficult for younger players. But all-in-all a good one.Disc 2:The Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikinie Bottom is a good one. Challenging games and nice graphics.Disc 3: "Spongebob Squarepants: Operation Crabby Patty has 5 levels of gameplay of 5 games, but at times feeling alittle redundant. Not so good.Bonus Disc: Nicktoons Basketball is the BEST OF THE SET, especially if your a fan of the NICKTOON line, chiefly because you can draft your own players with characters from,in addition to Spongebob characters, a team made from other Nickelodeon series like: boy genius Jimmy Neutron,Danny Phantom, Rugrats Timmy,Cosmo and Wanda, etc. You can also choose the positions they will play for Offence & Defence (Sandy Cheeks is an excellent forward) and who sits on the bench . You choose the court location as well. If this is too much freedom you may choose from pre-generated league teams and ramdom court selection.Nickelodeon fans will love this set, PARENTS WILL LOVE THE PRICE. While none of the games are really worth $20 alone, 4 for the price of "SPONGEBOB SQuarepants: LIGHTS, CAMERA, PANTS", is great!We haven't experienced any problems with the software itself, running on windows ME or post-2000 systems. It's all good, there.

The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, "Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill."Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom. The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things... Readers know this potential disappointment however will be rectified in part 2.

2001 cult-film "Donnie Darko" is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic Slaughterhouse-Five which Billy Pilgrim, becomes unstuck in time. Donnie, a textbook paranoid schizophrenic is "spared" when passenger-jet engine inexplicably, drops from the sky onto his bedroom, while he is out sleepwalking with Frank, his macabre bunny-suit wearing "imaginary" friend Frank. Darko explores wild variations on Dr. Hawkings theories on time in a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity. The film is loaded with interesting characters and interesting performances by a host of notable names like: Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze (really), Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA), lead by the talented Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEADS)as the temporally troubled teen.This 2004 Director's Cut includes, the 80's soundtrack reworked as originally intended (with all of the royalties and paperwork completed), also UK Darkomentary, cult shorts and commentary with director Richard Kelly (he made them do it) and comic-book fan Kevin Smith (who wasn't involved but liked the movie).This version is a great film to both disturb and amuse with its multiple genre nature (teen drama/horror/comedy/sci-fi/ etc.)

Yeah, that's right, I'll admit it: I've been waiting for this one to be released on DVD. Is that so wrong? Back in '78, this was Mark Hamill's first post-Star Wars project; we were excited to see "Luke Skywalker" again; even if he wasn't Luke here. We were also excited because Corvette Summer boasted one of the coolest custom 'vettes we'd ever seen, not to mention Annie Potts as a "working girl" This is a nice time capsule of the late 70's, I would recommend to anyone who grew up in that decade, Star Wars fans in particular.Nostalgia aside this isn't a bad comic chase as Hamill ("Kenny" here) searches for his custom car, made by his own 2 hands, neither of which is robotic at this point, aided and hindered by Potts, as the love-right-in-front-of-his-eyes interest. Hamill's youthful overacting is a pleasure to watch in itself.This film has aged well and has some really funny moments, like Hamill hitchhiking encounter with a lowrider fleet creeping to Vegas. Hamill and Potts are really in their prime here, Hamill maybe too much so, he was in an auto-accident following production which dramatically changed the looks preserved in "Summer." Take a look at "The Empire Strikes Back" and compare.

Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files, admitted his inspiration for the series to be the 70's network series Kolchak: The Night Stalker. The series a spin-off of two successful made-for-tv-movies about a newspaper reporter learning the hard way that the truth "is" out there, a truth invariably dismissed week after week by his short-fused editor. Carl Kolchak, played by Darren McGavin, now best known for "the Christmas Story" dad, gruffly pursues his stories no matter what supernatural path they might lead him down. Whether it be Aztec cults, Moss-monsters, Witches, Demons, headless motorcyclists, or the series' staples: Vampires. Kolchak fights them all. Sometimes Kolchak seems a far cry from heroic, at times almost cowardly, but we always admire his tenacity. One thing the short-lived series shares with the reinvented version, currently on TV, is the interesting peripheral characters who serve as Kolchak's allies and sources, like "Gourdy the Ghoul" (played by an actor who Odd Couple & Pooh Bear aficionados might recognize) one of the only pre-CSI forensics characters who doesn't eat lunch over the bodies. As dated as the production is on all 20 episodes, they are still fun to watch.

Louis Sachar the award-winning author of over twenty fiction and educational books for children including the Marvin Redpost and Wayside School series. Holes, won the prestigious National Book Award, the Newbery Medal, sold 6 million copies, and was successfully translated to film. Now we finally learn what life is like AFTER CAMP GREEN LAKE. "Small Steps" is a follow-up to Holes, it features ARMPIT aka Theodore Johnson, still digging holes, but now as a landscaper, trying to finish up high school. Armpit's new life is turned upside when X-Ray shows up with a ticket scalping scheme involving teen pop star, Kaira DeLeon. Armpit, who has been trying to take his own "small steps" to the straight and narrow, finds himself once again running afoul of the law.Eight years after Sachar's breakout hit with Holes, he needs to take big steps to fill "sweet-feet's" proverbal shoes. Does Sachar manage it? Yes, mostly, "Small Steps" is a good book, but not a great one. Sachar's voice is just as clear, and the situations are more realistic. He is most successful with relationships, like Armpit and Ginny a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy whose family lives on the other side of his family's East Austin duplex. The publisher should have resisted the temptation to call "Small Steps" a "companion to Holes" to reduce heavy expectations... especially since the obvious follow-up would be the story of Stanley, Zero and their newfound millions, instead of focusing on one of Camp Green Lake's less appealing characters..

UNLESS WE ACT NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE THE MOST TERRIBLE DISASTER IMAGINABLE...I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN!JUMPING JEHOSOPHAT! Imagine a sci-fi story with twice the potential for world armageddon, and that's what you have in INFERNO, a 7 part Dr. Who serial from Jon Pertwee's run as the interfering Timelord. Usually the story arcs longer than 4 parts, suffer from attempts to stretch out the episodes with padding and material that neither advances the story nor does it serve any real purpose. INFERNO, I'm happy to say is not one of those stories.The top-secret drilling project called "Inferno", is intended to penetrate the Earth's crust and release limitless energy for the world. Hungry for success the "powers that be " ignore warnings about the possible dangers of the project, some warnings coming from the Doctor, currently in his 3rd incarnation and exiled by his people, the Timelords,to Earth of the 20th century. While the Doctor still hopes to escape the confines of one planet, one time, by borrowing some of the power from the "Inferno" project. As unpaid scientific adviser to the paramilitary organization UNIT, or the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, he is frequently in the position to help them save the human race, most often from themselves. Although this is one time he only half-succeeds in averting world destruction. While the project proceeds in its attempt to drill over 20 miles through the Earth's crust, to tap the gas beneath it, a series of events begin leading to the end of the world, maybe two. A technician's contact with an enigmatic subterranean ooze, followed by a motiveless murder and a madman on the loose are mere opening clues for the Doctor, his brilliant assistant Liz Shaw and the project's head of security and UNIT's CO the Brigadier, to solve the unfolding mystery. But the Doctor's own agenda has him distracted: he is testing the console from the TARDIS (his immobilized time/space ship).More attacks occur involving the altered technician, through some "retrogressive mutation" he and anyone he's touched suffer a transformation into animal-things. More of the ooze is discovered from the drilling outpipe, at first the substance defies analysis, while the project head, Prof. Stahlman conceals that he has touched it. He continues to ignore all warnings to stop drilling, those from both the Doctor and the computer, the later which he sabotages himself. Becoming increasingly obsessive as he regresses further, he orders the Doctor's power supply cut-off at a critical juncture in his experiments with the TARDIS console. This caused the Doctor to travel "sideways in the time/space continuum" to a parallel universe. He's on earth right when and where he was but things are a bit askew, UNIT is not longer managing security, replaced by RSF (the Republican Security Forces), the Brigadier is now the eye-patched and mustacheless Brigade-Leader (scars and facial hair are always major factors in reality shifts), Liz is now Section Leader Shaw. As it happens the project is marginally more advanced than the Doctor's universe, Prof. Stalman is just as dangerously obsessed and infected, but the Doctor never existed, so he is promptly thought a spy, a saboteur, arrested and tossed in a cell with an infected technician. After the Doctor escapes, he tries again to stop the countdown, but it is too late Prof. Stalman is to far gone and others don't believe him until it is too late, as the Doctor puts it, "Listen to that, it's the sound of this planet screaming out its rage!...Compared to the forces you've unleashed, an Atomic blast would be like a summer breeze!"What is always Dr. Who at it's most frightening is when the Doctor, the ever-present voice of optimism and internal hope ...when the Doctor gives up. That is when Dr. Who is just plain spooky. The Doctor says: "Sorry, we're past the point of no return, you've uncorked the genie from the bottle and there's nothing I can do." The parallel players consign themselves to try to help the Doctor to escape. Seriously, that's it, they begin hoping against hope that they just might be able to send him off alone on the off chance that his Earth might avoid the same catastrophic blunder (except for the Brigadier's counterpart, who hopes to force the Doctor into using the TARDIS as a interdimensional lifeboat).INFERNO really is one of the best that Jon Pertwee's era has to offer. Thankfully BBC video has taken this opportunity to really clean up the footage (most color originals of Inferno were listed among the BBC fire causualties, the American reruns most of us saw in the 80's were all shaky BLACK & WHITE back-up reels, AND WE WERE THANKFUL FOR IT!).INFERNO'S length allow for a greater development of character and relationships that serve the dual roles of the major and minor players, while confirming their natures by contrasting them (like the hot/cold between the crass but brave, in any universe, Drilling Consultant SUTTON and the all-business Assistant Director Dr. PETRA WILLIAMS.Like the Doctor says, "Fascinating, so many similarities, yet so many differences."The Liz Shaw and the Brigadier of "Universe B" are really just versions of themselves behaving as they would in a world dominated by fascism, but no one is "evil" in this story. Even Project Director Prof. Stahlman, the man whom which this disaster(s) would not be possible without, is merely obsessive and arrogant, then out of his mind, but even the monsters aren't evil, just kind of "hot & bothered."Robert A. Heinlein author of "STRANGER in a STRANGE LAND" and the universe-shifting novel "JOB: A COMEDY OF JUSTICE" cites H.G. WELLS as having invented all of the basic fantasy themes, including the parallel universe, specifically: MEN LIKE GODS. Of course, the Sci-Fi channels loaded with them, including spoofs in Futurama, and just this year (probably the BBC's real motivation behind this release) the brilliant second season of the new Dr. Who features the 2 parter "AGE of STEEL/RISE of the CYBERMEN" in which the Cybermen are reborn (or rebuilt) on an alternate Earth. My point is INFERNO is a good story in good company, but not without it's clich&eacute;s & faults.The monsters in this one are alittle on the poor side of Lon Chaney and the Doctor, literially defeats the same ones over and over again, but I recommend adding this DVD to your Dr. Who collection.One of my favorite experiences linked w/ DW is gathering w/ friends to watch, debate & other nefarious purposes.... So here is some INFERNO clich&eacute;s for drinking games. Drink when:--Someone is accused of traitorous talk/ behavior or sabotage--The Doctor drives "Bessie" seemingly w/out purpose--You see possible stock footage (of molten materials)--The universe changes P.O.V. to an alternate one--The Doctor calls authoritarian figures rude names--You experience any feeling of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu (in any universe)

With the new X-MEN finally comes the climax to the great philosophical and physical war between Charles Xavier and Magneto (both portrayed superbly by Star Trek's Patrick Steward and LOTR's Sir Ian McKellen). The original X-men movie is single-handedly responsible for proving that a decent MARVEL superhero movie could be made, effectively paving the way for SPIDER-MAN, which raised the bar even higher for the genre. In X-MEN: the LAST STAND, the mutants of Xaiver's school are back and growing in number as more comic characters are included in the third installment of the film series. Notable are the additions of KELSEY GRAMMER as the cerebral blue-furred BEAST a.k.a. Dr. Hank Mcoy . The BEAST was one of the 60's comic book original X-Men, along with the winged mutant THE ANGEL, played by Ben Foster (6 Feet Under). Vinnie Jones is the unstoppable fighting machine Juggernaut(who does not appear to be related to Prof. X in this incarnation). Other mutants returning for extended appearences are Kitty Pryde a.k.a. SHADOWCAT who can pass thru walls, more of the steel-skinned Colossus, more from the traitorous PYRO. Oscar-winner Anna Paquin returns as ROGUE,struggling with her relations & mutant powers. Shawn Ashmore again plays Bobby Drake a.k.a ICEMAN, throwing comic fans a frosty treat appearing briefly in ice-form. Rebecca Romijn is back in her glorious blue nakedness as the evil Mystique and Aaron Stanford as the disgruntled PYRO. James Marsden returns (briefly) as a grief-stricken Cyclops, even his lost-lady-love returns with Famke Janssen again as Jean Grey and more(read story summary below). Of course, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, Jackman is still a perfect Wolverine. Oscar winner Halle Berry is back as the weather-controlling STORM, who finally flies in this one, sort of an homage to their former director's new project (read on.).Along with all the new mutants, another addition is the director himself, losing Bryan Singer to this summers SUPERMAN RETURNS, X-MEN 3 is directed by BRETT RATNER (RUSH HOUR 1&2) Brett Ratner is still keeping with the recurring theme of mutants still struggling with acceptance, their powers and whether or not they even want those powers.I think the plot is more interesting than the previous two....here's the story (plot spoilers ahead):A potential "cure" is discovered and processed to treat -- and ultimately eliminate -- genetic mutations, once and for all. . Mutants have a choice: retain their abilities, inspite of it isolating them, or give up their powers becoming human. Prof. X, advocate of tolerance between human and mutantkind, and the leader of the Brotherhood, Magneto, Xavier's fallen-friend who believes that bring mankind to their knees is the only path to peace, finally have the battle we've waited 2 movies to see. The X-Men vs. the brotherhood vs. humankind. They must also face their former teammate, Jean Grey's unleasing the Dark Phoenix, her super-powered alter-ego (I mean "super-powered" like change the script kind of power)danger to the entire planet.This is a good effort, especially with the nortoriously unlucky number "3" following the name. It has a lot of the mutant characters we've been waiting for, it even has the long overdue pairing of Colossus and Wolverine in battle together. As well as more effective use of Wolverine in combat scenes, which the other movies do more sparingly than you mght expect. The music in this one is distractly melodramatic at times thought. Also, stay after the credits for a little treat.

Much like the elusive UK graphitti artist himself this super documentary, loosely focused on 'street art' is hard to catch. I missed it for a very brief arthoise run in New Orleans theaters and now it is already listed ad out-of-stock on Amazon. I feared this limit release and preordered, don't give up, keep checking here for it, it is worth it. I'd highly recommend it, although it is on instant in Netflix independent genres I'd further recommend getting the DvD like we did, because it comes with Banksy decals & postcards also in the extras: the original movie the French "film-maker" (who is the film's real focus ) made before Banksy concludes the Frenchman may be mentally ill & made his own movie. Tje film's footage contains behind the scenes of actual street outtings with Banksy, Invader even Shepard Fairey ( the real force whether it be tounge-cheek, behind much of Obama's underground success as a presidential contender). Amazing studio footage and bits you may have seen on YouTube and wondered "where and how did they get this?"...somewhat explained before Banksy turns tables and makes his own movie while making his own monster, turninga quirky wouldbe movie maker into a street art sensation M.B.W. I can't recommend this movie enough....get one ...OBEY.

1st: WATCHMEN is an amazing film adaptation of an amazing graphic novel and you need to see it ( and read it)...2nd : Neither the film nor the graphic novel is for kids...this ain't the Incredibles (although there are obvious intention parallels on Pixar's part). WATCHMEN is rated R for sex, intense violence and big blue full frontal from the only true super-powered super hero in the mix, Dr. Manhattan. This is actually fairly distracting in IMAX, but props to the director for refusing to put pants on the guy (yes he does wear pants at some point but this part is true the comic).If you've never heard of the WATCHMEN now is a good time to learn.... Comic book fans, like myself have been waiting over 20 years for the big screen live action version...Alan Moore's 12 part comic mini-series which coined the term "Graphic Novel" and established the genre's ability to aspire to the ranks of literature (Time Magazine ranked it in the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century 1923-2005)...set in the year it was published WATCHMEN tells the story of cold war era world with masked heroes (forced into retirement) who are being killed off. More importantly the story centers on the deconstruction of the "super hero" exploring the flawed heroes of two generations of vigilantes. In addition to having lots of costumed heroes around History is different is that President Nixon is still president, currently serving his 5th term thanks to have won Vietnam, using the god-like power of Dr. Manhattan. In fact Dr. M's power is the only thing keeping the super-powers in check, but nuclear war still seems inevitable.In less than typical fashion, hero origins and backstories are told throughout the movie through flashbacks, some more brutal than others. Although WATCHMEN was a DC comic it isn't set in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman.But you can tell your players without a program...The next generation of heroes following in the footsteps of their post-WW II predecessors the MINUTEMEN are...The NITE OWL II aka Dan Dreilberg, the Batman like hero desperate to get back in action in his the Owl-looking air-vehicle, Dan is probably most heroic and the least flawed of all the characters.The SILK SPECTRE aka Laurie Juspeczyk, her mother was one of the original Minutemen and Laurie inheirents the role. Gets involved with Dr. M and the Nite Owl.RORSCHACH aka Walter Kovacs, kind of a hard-boiled-detective-with-a-grappling-hook, Rorschach is trying to catch the "Mask Murder" and probably has more problems than any other character in the story, the villains included.DOCTOR MANHATTAN aka Jon Osterman, the result of an "accident in the lab" Dr. M is the only super-powered character and is blue.OZYMANDIAS aka Adrian Veidt is the self-styled world's smartest/fittest man. Veidt fancies himself akin to Alexander the Great and is the only hero with the wherewithal to create his OWN action figure line.The COMEDIAN aka Edward Blake is the murder victim of the "Mask Killer" and ex-owner of the iconic-bloody-smiley. Blake is a mercenary feared by the bad guys as well as the good guys. Imagine a sadistic, over-sexed Capt. America.It has nearly panel per panel recreated the original comic composition of Moore's artist co-creator Dave Gibbons.... the dialogue is almost identical and very few edits were made (biggest cut was the comic-within-the-comic "the Black Freighter" which was animated to be released later in full (it is likely that the film pacing is better for the cut). The casting is perfect and thankfully mostly low profile "unknown" actors. The costuming and effects are equally incredible. The art direction, from Alex McDowell and Francois Auduoy, is on a scale of it's own, with attention to detail that is overwhelmingly accurate to the backstory and lesser details of the graphic novel.A great and complex look at "super-heroes." Like the graphic novel, WATCHMEN the movie, truly explores the highs and lows of the human experience, with or without capes, Moore's words are still powerful and with a running time of under 3 hours, I say, why so short?

What if a super-spy, like James Bond or his groovier counterparts like Matt Helm, or dare I say it: John "Danger Man" Drake, decides to retire? With all of the "eyes only" info locked always in these spy's heads, plenty of parties either want this information, or they want to make sure it isn't given to the wrong parties. Enter "The Village" a surreal (as only the late 60's can do surreal) place to extract or lock away said information. Just like in the spy game these spys become numbers not names. Let the mind games begin as one prisoner known only as Number 6, refused to talk, break or conform. But, in the Village, who are the warders and who are the prisoners? Who's side are they on? Who's side is anyone on? Are the cold war baddies running the Village or Number 6's former employers?....Questions are a burden on others and a prison for oneself.Number 6 is #1 !!! The original "paranoid" series is back for it's 40th birthday, with it a look back to the mind-bending series that not only created the paranoid-conspiracy series (like those that sprung-up in the 80's), but it also created the MINI-SERIES, before there were mini-series (in fact the studios failed to see this vision and insisted on padded episodes to stretch it out to a full season).This is a must see exploration of what is means to be an individual in a society that wish us to conform. The message rings as loudly today as it did in the 60's, although the sets are groovy, and the effects dated, there is a timelessness in the Village that keeps the series watchable even today.Comics, novels and heavy metal tributes, we've never left the Village. Even M. Night borrowed his title and paranoid mood for his second to last film from the classic series. Once you go to the Village you'll never leave, until the DVDs run out. Long live Number 6.

Tripping the Rift, the CGI science fiction spoof, which began as a couple of internet shorts before airing on Canadian TV, then Sci Fi Channel, returns as an unrated DVD release with no holds barred. As raunchy and filled with gratuitous nudity as you'd expect, Tripping the Rift the Movie is 75 minutes of science fiction spoofs and gags consistent with the TV version.The cast returns for this original made for DVD release. Stephen Root, best known for Newsradio, again voices the morally bankrupt, over-sexed captain Chode of the Jupiter 42 ( nod to "Lost in Space" and "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.") The archetypical prissy gold robot parody of C-3PO, Gus, again played by the great Maurice LaMarche (Futurama).The A.I. spaceship Bob, a parody of Hal from "2001" is Stuttering John Melendez. Also returning are Whip (Rick Jones) Chode's horny lizard nephew and T'nuk (Gayle Garfinkle) the nasty quadrupedal pilot. Let's not forget the android sex slave, played since the series creation by notable voices like: Patricia Beckmann and Terry Farrell (in both versions of the pilot) Gina Gershon, and Carmen Electra.The most recent voice of "Six of Nine" from season 3, Jenny McCarty.The story begins as the crew a planet in order protect a princess in a suspiciously Slavic setting down to the black in white genre touches. While the Young Frankenstein / Weekend at Bernies/ Moon over Parador spoof continues Chode is being stalked, in color, by a bulletproof cyborg clown on steroids. The homage to the Terminator continues as the parodies move onto the crew's relocation to the suburbs and Desperate Housewives. Darph Bobo, the supreme Dark Clown who wants to take over the universe, returns to evenge himself on Chode for taking advantage of his daughter Babette.Overall this DVD effort is as good as it's TV incarnation, it isn't so over-the-top that I could see it as a theatrical release, but it flow pretty good, although the "I love Slovinia" song is sort of lame. Upshot is that fans of the series will love this, fans of adult cartoons like South Park will be okay with it, but casual sci-fi fans will likely take it or leave it.

Sadly "It's a TRAP" is the final Family Guy take on the original Star Wars Trilogy, concluding the Laugh it Up, Fuzzball Trilogy. According to creator Seth MacFarlane "It's a TRAP" is to be the last of the Star Wars parodies as the Family Guy team feels the SW prequels are already animated enough (although Peter Griffin expects that the Cleveland Show will do them). Return of the Jedi in their opinion, and most Star Wars fans, is the worst of the original Trilogy, so it stands to reason that the Family Guy parody of episode VI. should be the lesser of the animated spoofs. I find that this isn't the case, although there is a disclaimer in the opening crawl to this effect, in actuality this outing is just a funny and irreverent as the rest of the Specials or the TV series for that matter, well maybe slightly less (see Penultimate paragraph below). The story continues with the familiar characters from Quahog, Rhode Island retelling the story of Star Wars while portraying natural role assignments: Stewie as Vader, Peter as Han, Chris is Luke, Lois as Leia, Brian plays Chewy, Cleveland and Quagmire play R2 & CPO. "Darkside" role pick-ups return with Carter Pewterschimidt ( as the Emperor and Carl the convenience store clerk is Yoda, Ernie the Giant Chicken returns as Boba Fett and Mort Goldman as Lando. Great character cameos include characters from the Cleveland Show and American Dad like Klaus as Admiral Ackbar, Roger as imperial Moff Jerjerrod, Tim as an Ewok and Rallo Tubbs, too. The guest star cameo list again include Rush Limbaugh, Patrick Stuart, Michael Dorn, Carrie Fisher, Anne Hathaway, Mary Hart and of course Mr. Conway Twitty. The story naturally follows Return of the Jedi's premise, Han's rescue from Jabba the Hutt and the mission against the new Deathstar begins, while Luke must confront Vader and the Emperor. Then the hilarity ensues as in the previous parodies. Especially notable scenes are the "special edition" CGI sockpuppet appearances and the Seth Green trashing finale.Of course, like "Blue Harvest" and "Something, something Dark Side" the Family Guy versions depend partly on at least passing pop culture, some Star Wars awareness and partly on an intricate knowledge of Star Wars. This isn't a complaint really, just a curious observation. For example is you haven't seen Return of the Jedi in it's original non-special edition theater or VHS format you may not get the Ewok song gags. Great stuff no matter what, the only thing missing is the staple musical number, like Hebert's Ben Kenobi Dirty Dancing in " Blue Harvest" and Chris' Luke-Duet in "Darkside." This may be just as well as the later number, seemed forced, no pun intended.I hope this isn't the last of their straight to DVD parodies, as the series references Star Wars more than any other movies, it was a natural. But, trying to think of a series reference that runs close second, it could be the "Back to the Future Trilogy" "Indiana Jones" or "Magnum P.I." Well I can dream can't I?

Redford's star-studded take on Gregory Bernstein & James Solomon's story (and screenplay) surrounding the true-story of the female conspirator of the Lincoln Assassination. The mother of John Surratt, the conspirator at large, is trialled, in part to bring (john) Surratt out of hiding. An impressive job here, by Redford, in making an historical footnote Mary Surratt into an interesting if possibly noble character! But much of the movie depends on James McAvoy's emotion portrayal of Union-vet/war-hero and neophyte lawyer Frederick Aiken, who defended the sole female conspirator after Wilkes Booth was shot.The film also follows the historical strand of Kevin Kline as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton who while running the government immediately following The assassination is overly eager to have an execution(s) and be done with the whole affair. Great old-school period drama with Robin Wright, Evan Rachel Wood, Tom Wilkinson, Justin Long, Danny Huston, Norman Reedus, Colm Meaney (great to see Colm again!).

..In 1969 and 1975 anti-hero Marshal Rooster Cogburn was portrayed by John Wayne. Cogburn is portrayed as an anti-hero, a breakout from the typical strait-laced hero Wayne normally played. It earned the Duke his only Oscar for the first of the two movies. I hope history, repeats itself in this 2010 film remake. Jeff Bridges' Cogburn is perhaps an even more perfect a portrayal of the blustering character created by Charles Portis in his 1968 novel. Perhaps, closer to the original story overall in this adaptation has murderer Tom Chaney hunted by a 14-year-old farm girl who means to capture her father's killer with the aid of the toughest U.S. marshal she can find. The Marshal is a man with "true grit, never having had a dry day in his entire life." The two are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, played with just a pinch of bumbling by Matt Damon, who wants Chaney for a large Texas bounty. The mismatched trio find snow, snakes and surprises on the journey, and each has their "grit" tested in typical Coen Brother fashion.

There a many reasons I was (and remain) excited for the release of Suckerpunch:1) An original concept by the director of such Graphic Novel adaptations as 300, Watchmen and the Upcoming Man of Steel Superman reboot project, too.2.) I'm always ready for Retro-Neo-Anime-kick-a$$-Chicks, including the lovely Emily Browning as an institutionalized girl slated for a lobotomy who escapes to a reality as Babydoll along with 4 equally hot inmates the brash Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-wise Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and dear-reluctant Sweet-Pea (Abbie Cornish) as fact and fiction merge.3.)Suckerpunch is the first mainstream DieselPunk movie since 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' or 'Dark City' although it is not a pure example of the sub-genre as there's modern firearms and fantasy aspects present which diverges from traditional Dieselpunk. If you aren't familiar with the genre DieselPunk it's a term coined by by game designer Lewis, to include a WW II look along with stylistic influences of that period like Art Deco, pulp serial film cliffhangers , film noir, even pinups.Ultimately Suckerpunch's premise of removing us and characters from the 'real' world provides ammo for over-the-top action, but at the cost of creating cliched characters. While one can make an argument for the archetypes and roles assumed here, it can also be argued it can be too formulaic. The film's action scenes are epic, no question, but opportunities are missed to develop them. In the end a needed narrator closes the gaps in on-screen exposition with what can also be construed as a stylistic element and not a flaw incharacter development or storytelling.The story is largely akin to Alice in Wonderland meets the Anime feature of your choice.,, our incarcerated heroines band together to escape the hands of Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by collecting 5 symbolic items, a map, fire, a knife, a key and a mystery all while building their own sense of self-worth, of course.Having grown up with the Star Wars saga, the storytelling aspects of film scoring is a very important consideration for me; here Suckerpunch is a knockout (sorry). The soundtrack merges nicely with it's visuals, single songs framing scenes using clever covers, mash-ups and remixes from Queen, Bjork, The Pixies, The Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, Iggy Pop. Some featuring vocals from stars themselves, for example, Emily Browing's cover of Eurythmics'"Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This"Other casting includes Jonathan Perez as Magician, Vicky Lambert as The Countess, Danny Bristol as Little Tommy Soldier

WHAT A WAY TO CELEBRATE 40+ years in time and space with the first 3 episodes! Presented here are the first 3 William Hartnell stories arcs in 1 set. This is a great way to be introduced to the longest running TV sci-fi series in (and of) history. When we first meet the Doctor's "granddaughter" SUSAN, through her concerned and curious school teachers, IAN & Barbara. The Doctor, very the ANTI-HERO, almost frightening in this story, as he almost abducts the pair to protect his secret (not that he is a Timelord) that he is from "the future" and can travel in time and space. The outer shape of the time machine, A.K.A. the TARDIS remains stuck in the famous police-call-box disguise as it appears on the cusp of the "ice age." After a great 2 episode start, "Unearthly Child" becomes a fairly cliched tale of escape and capture RUNNING from and with cavemen. In 1963, Film and time was at a premium for the fledgling show, so many flubbed lines and missed cues remain in this remastered set. IT IS STILL A MUST SEE/OWN STORY FOR new and old DR. WHO FANS.The next story introduces the Doctors 40 yr. nemesis, and easily he revial for pop culture popularity, THE DALEKS in the aptly title story arc, "The Daleks." For a series that was intended to introduce history to children, the show immediately gets off track in this 2nd story, introducing the Doctor's classic alien-cyborg foe, thank God. Overall, not a great story, but it is so monumentous a meeting that it is fun to watch on that merit alone!The 3rd story arc "The Edge of Destruction" is what the Trek writers refered to as a "bottle episode." In an attempt to cut costs on enough stories to save money for the big shows, we have a story contained completely in the TARDIS control room. The "characters trapped in an elevator" story is a fast, cheap way of establishing and defining characters early in a series, Edge of Destruction is highly successful in this way.This is a great set at a good price.DON'T SETTLE FOR crummy BOOTLEGS! GET THESE CLEANED & POLISHED PIECES OF TIMELORD HISTORY!

Better pacing than the novel "Order" trims the story while keeping the spirit of the text. Like the text the franchise is progressively darker, set in an almost post-911 world, following the disturbing events of the Goblet of Fire. Everything's changed... But not the superb casting with more Oscar Winners than you can shake a wand at, Oldman delivers again as Harry's Godfather Sirius Black aka Padfoot (the nickname is actually referenced in this one). Of course, this one has a climatic full scale battle of wands (the largest yet ) and Michael Gambon successfully dispenses Dumbledore's final duel with the Dark Lord a.k.a Tom. If you have the chance to see this in IMAX, by all means do so, oh yes!The story...Before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can even start their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is attacked by Dementors, then placed on trail for underage magic in front of a muggle. He isn't the only one under fire from a Minstry of Magic in denial, so is Hogwarts itself, when loathsome Dolores Umbridge, new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, played by Oscar winning actress Imelda Staunton, appears to oppress the place. Failing to be taught actual defensive magic Harry and crew form a secret class of their own, but the newly revived Voldemort, again played by Ralph Fiennes, along with a face-full of Death Eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter (who I had in mind when I first read the book) and Lucius Malfoy (still Jason Isaacs), are plotting something nasty.Harry's rage and isolation is effectively portrayed, as is his edited relationship with Cho. Some of the novel's best lines remain intact here, like Ron and Hermione's assessment of Harry's kissing. Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts isn't altered enough to lose it's punch, neither is the film's exploration of teen rebellion and the consequences of becoming adults. Some of the films real heart comes from not only the brief moments between Harry and his godfather (Sirius gives volumes of exposition when refers to Harry as James during the climax), but moments between Harry and quirky Luna Lovegood, as they reflect on life, death and nargles.The effects are brilliant even though the CGI centaurs return, but thankfully do not speak or leave the shadows (see Sorcerer's Stone, yikes!), the other magical creatures look good, house-elves and horses alike. But ....the the wand battle will likely set a new standard for magic in film!

In the 80's Pete n' Ray were a huge underground hit! Unknown to the guys who recorded their loud neighbors. Ed & Mitch lost control of this audio as it was viral before the Web was invented... This documentary represents they attempt to gain control over the material while telling it's origins, including a retroactive meeting with Peter explaining the Cult of the Tapes and offering him a royalty check. 'Shut up Little Man" is a great exploration of street legends in the same vein as Red's Tube Bar Tapes or Orson Welles' Green Pea rant. The play based on the tape in the 90's and Hollywood's angle on developing treatments. The audio is Still going to this day although now it's copyrighted... That hasn't stopped Peter Haskett vs Christian Bale type mixes.

The Seeds of Doom represents an excellent end to the 1976 13th season of Doctor Who. It was originally slammed for being too violent, but in spite of some silly concepts a good adventure featuring Tom Baker's portrayal of the Timelord's 4th incarnation. This 6 parter has lots to offer, some typical of Doctor Who and some more likely found in a Bond movie, for example: brutal hired gunmen (Bond), a psychotic organ-playing mastermind bent on world domination ( Bond) for vegetables (Dr. Who), a mysterious seed from space ( Dr. Who) a mission to an antarctic research station to recover it (Bond) bound hero about to be mulched is taunted by villain (both Dr. Who & Bond).In fact the Doctor is entered into the story in a fashion reminiscent of 007 meeting M for a current assignment ( of course Bond would never play with a yo-yo in M's office). Mr. Richard Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau shows the Doctor photographs of a pod removed from the permafrost after laying there for twenty thousand years. The Doctor eventually decrees the pod a dangerous extraterrestrial known as a Krynoid and the game begins. Unfortunately Dunbar has sold the location to the Mad Millionaire Chase, who considers it his mission to protect the plant life of Mother Earth, and such a valuable specimen as the pod could easily disappear.... for a price. The pod is naturally a threat to all animal life on Earth.The Story has lots of interesting characters like Chase's henchman Scorby, whose bullying of his partner Keeler, is as entertaining as Mr Chase's own over-the-top performances. Other quirky characters like Amelia Ducat, one of the world's leading flower artists, who aids the Doctor in getting into Chase's estate to stop his evil plans for the Krynoid. The Doctor even teams up with UNIT for one last time (until his 7th incarnation) although sadly neither the Brigadier nor any recognizable UNIT regulars appear.All the violence aside... "Seeds" is a solid Dr. Who serial with some great moments. Just asChase soon asks "What do you do for an encore, Doctor?"His response....."I win."Seeds of Doom Drinking GameDrink whenever....The Doctor is socked or has a gun pointed at himThe Doctor socks someone or points a gun at them!!!The Doctor warns anyone 'not to touch the pod.'a British scientist diesThe radios are sabotaged or the phone lines cut.The Doctor yells, "Scorby!!"Whenever a building explodes or in engulfed in tentacles.Whenever Chase plays his organ for the plants.The Doctor and/or Sarah get caught by a badie, have a another if they are also tied-up.When ever someone becomes, runs from or is killed by a Krynoid.

E. L. Konigsburg, best known for "THE MIXED-UP FILES" tells the tragic story of a young boy who is struck dumb when he is accused of injuring his baby half-sister. "Silent to the Bone" was published in 2000 by Scholastic in it Konigsburg shows us that silence can be a way to listen and learn or a way to hide from the truth. Readers who are familiar with Konigsburg might say that this book is different from her others in several ways, one being that it is more like a mystery.Branwell Zamborska, a sensitive, unusual boy, with freckles and red hair and he is tall for his age. His mother died when he was only 9 months old and for the past 12 years it has only been him and his father and they have become very close. Bran, as his friends called him, felt very left out as he learned that his father had been seeing someone "new" and would soon be getting remarried. As if Bran did not feel lonely enough since his dad remarried, now news of a new baby had come along.Soon after the baby is born an au par named Vivian was hired to watch the baby Nikki. Branwell finds himself to be attracted to this older girl. In turn she uses this attraction to benefit herself as she is not fulfilling her job as Nikki's caregiver. When Branwell comes home from school one day he finds Nikki's breathing to be shallow and he calls to Vivian for help. Vivian instructs Branwell to call 911 but when the operator comes on the line Branwell is unable to speak. He cannot explain to the operator what is wrong. He simply cannot utter a single sound. Vivian then takes the phone and tells the medics that Branwell has dropped his sister.Nikki was taken to the County Hospital and Branwell was sent straight to a juvenile behavioral center for this disturbing accusation. Bran's best friend Connor tries to help him throughout this ordeal because he knows that Branwell could never have done such a terrible thing. Connor tries to communicate with him in many different ways. Connor also calls on his half sister Margaret for help. Through different types of communication like touching letters of the alphabet to spell out words, Connor is led by Branwell to follow leads as to what truly happened. Connor reports to Branwell each day on Nikki's progress as well as his own progress.Slowly, Connor reveals the truth of what really happened to Nikki. Vivian turned out to be the person who really caused Nikki's injuries. She was trying to cover up her affair with a local guy which Branwell had accidentally stumbled upon when he came home from school early one day. As Vivian is uncovered as the bad person and Nikki begins to get better, Branwell slowly regains his speech. Branwell's speech had been taken away by emotion. Bran and Connor each learn a valuable lesson about true friendship and the truth that can be heard through silence.This lastest work from Konigsburg is more mature than previous works, but is the quality readers has come to expect from the notable author.

Can't say I miss any of the absent original cast members... Johnny Depp is so perfect as Capt. Jack Sparrow you likely won't notice either. Although Geoffrey Rush returns as Capt. Barbossa as well as Sparrow's first-mate. This time Jack is searching for the Fountain of youth. Ian McShane (of Deadwood is electric as BlackBeard. Penelope Cruz is mostly forgettable , the mermaids may have the uppper hand for on screen female presence. I certainly enjoyed it more than the last movie of the film series. The ending is painfully predictable, but it made infinitely more sence than the last two... Although clearly every pirate in the Disney Universe is packing magic and zombies.. I can't wait to see how they supe-up Long John Silver in Pirates V.

The late-night classic from the 70's returns. Out on the rural highways and byways speeds Satan's evil sedan running down the unwary, no matter how righteous. This beautiful "B" horror film, wheeled in with the wave of "Devil movies," including the Exorcist, in the 70's. But the twist here is that a driver-less CAR is doing Satan's bidding! There's also some strange parallels to a certain shark movie released the same year. There's loads of shots of the CAR prowling the desert roads, sweet "point of view" shots from the evil vehicle's interior, and the glorious "HORN FROM HELL" literally scaring the be-jesuz' out of those motoring-mortals. The music is a little dated, as is the production value, but the premise is so classic, it is worth owning, especially to shake-up a horror movie marathon or a "when cars attack" themed evening.Classic moments include the CAR struggling unable to cross onto "hallowed ground" to get it's victims and the ultimate fate of the Satan's ride.Futurama satirises "The Car" and "The Howling" in an episode called "The Honking." The made-for-TV Herbie remake with Bruce Campbell has a "Car" homage with an evil VW beetle made by Nazis.

Contrary to it's theatrical trailer's claims to be 'based on a true story' Pirate Radio is an ensemble comedy about a fictitious group of 1966 DJs illegally broadcasting tunes from the "Radio Rock" anchored in the international waters of the North Sea. Full of terrific cast chemistry and an amazing Catalog of 60's rock & pop the film runs 2 hrs. The crew are the targets of the generic UK establishment embodied by a superbly mirthless government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) who resolves to shut down the pirates. Meanwhile, subplots abound as Young Carl, a recently expelled teen joins the crew and attempts to fit in, possibly to lose his virginity with the aid of the DJs, perhaps even to meet his father for the first time. The list of possible and improbable suspects include: Carls Godfather and 'station' manager Quentin (Bill Nighy), brash American DJ "The Count" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), "Doctor" Dave (Nick Frost), returned legend Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans). As pressure increases from the suits, so does DJ rivalry.Everyone is just fab in this, Nighy is as perfectly suited for this era as he was playing a rocker in Love actually, in fact Rhys seems to be playing a younger version of that very character, brilliantly !!! Frost is at his best, although I did not recognize him w/out Simon Pegg, as another of the amoral DJs. Hoffman is on his game as ever. Emma Thompson has a great cameo role, suspiciously disconnected from her real ex's half of the picture. The best radio movie I've seen, well worth the running time. Many on the scenes seem shot in a one camera take that sells the crews moments together well. Ultimately the climax is predictable but still satisfying.What have we learned? Guys in suits don't like fun. If you go to sea you may find love, and your dad. 17 hours does not a marriage make. Vinyl can't swim. The birds dig guys with fab sideburns.

The game play on GOBLET matches the earier games, as does the graphics.The most unique feature is also the greatest weakness of the game: Multiple-player game play.In Harry 1 & 2 you are able to play Harry.In Harry 3 yor are able to switch from Harry to his wizard cohortsNow you and you're wizard cohorts can play together (except during Triwizard Challenges in which Harry has to go-it-alone.This mult-player game play can slow down progress with less experienced player in the mix, but it can be plenty of fun otherwise.The BB Every-Flavour Beans are a game staple ofcourse, but going through Mad-Eye's lessons on the castle's exterior can literially get circular.The Tri-Wizard Cup is the focus, with little nod to the Quidditch World Cup (much like the movie version), but the Quidditch World Cup PC Game already covered Cup-play anyway.Good game, just don't over pay the Muggles for it.

Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an 85 minute, full-length adventure with the short-feature claymation heroes Wallace and Gromit. Peter Sallis, now in his 80's, voices inventor Wallace who along with his slightly more intelligent dog Gromit, are a security-service keeping the town veggies safe from rabbits before the approaching vegetable contest. The pair meet Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), customer and love-interest for Wallace. Lady Tottington appreciates their humane methods, the Bun-Vac 6000, while the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes)does not. Before long an invention gos 'ORRIBLY WRONG and creates a giant were-rabbit which threatens to do more than just put Wallace and Gromit out of business.Nick Park, creator of Wallace and Gromit shorts, probably best known by mainstream audiences for "Chicken Run" and the "Gas commercials with talking car testimonals, does his best work here. The "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" spoofs the monster movie classics with lighting and camerawork so perfect, you'd swear some scenes were in black & white. In spite of it's G-rating Park throws in some cheeky "Benny Hill" moments aimed at older viewers, but nothing to take away from the family appeal of a film destined to be one of the best films ever to use the claymation medium.

Yes! The Year 3000 is back!! This is all-new material, NOT RECYCLED or from 4 seasons offered in volumes 1-4 or Monster Fun. All new from the Simpson's creator Matt Groening and the Futurama team.It's here the first of the 4 "NEW" FUTURAMA direct-to-DVD videos, 3 of which will be released throughout 2008. Following "BENDER'S BIG SCORE" will be, "INTO THE WILD GREEN YONDER" then, "BENDER'S GAME" and THE BEAST WITH A BILLION BACKS." The features will be cut into an episode format to air eventually on Comedy Central, not Cartoon Network.Each of these feature the brilliant original voice talent, from the short-lived fox series: John Di Maggio (as Bender and others), Dave Herman (as the Honorable Mayor C. Randall Poopenmayer and more ) Katey Sagal (Leela), Phil LaMarr (Hermes), Lauren Tom (Amy Wong), Billy West (Fry, Zoidberg, Farnsworth, an other Futurama, but known as Stimpy and from the Howard Stern Show, West does the best LARRY FINE in the business), old school veterans like Frank Welker (here for Nibbler but he's the original Fred Jones, if you saw Saturday morning, you can bet he was in it) and Maurice LaMarche (as Morbo, but LaMarche was on the original Transformers, amoung other projects) and Tress a.k.a. "Skinner's Mom" MacNeille (most recently played the "Spider-Pig" in Simpson's Movie). This time around Sarah Silverman is a guest along with others, like Star War's Mark Hamill.The Story:The Planet Express crew are back, only to be accidently sold to evil nudist aliens in an internet racket (remember kids don't give out personal info. on-line). The aliens desire information and upon learning the secret of paradox-free time travel is tatooed onto Fry's butt, the turn Bender into an evil (well more-evil) time-traveling killing/stealing machine. Incidently, Leela nearly wed, a major character is beheaded and the Universe is torn asunder.This paradox-free nature creates an op for lots of return appearances and cool cameos. The opening credits goof nicely on the epic-DVD movie release, filled with glam-shots of the characters and their full names. Any questions explained are quickly replaced by more confusing questions.The spirit of the original series is easily matched and able to sustain the 89 min. movie format.As always the Futurama DVD extras are insanely funny and worthly of the name "special features." For example, a full-episode of "EVERYBODY LOVES HYPNOTOAD" (a 20+ min. gag that you need to let run in its course to fully appreciate the joke), an animated promo for Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, a MATH LECTURE, I said a "MATH LECTURE" really! Many of the Producers & writers involved with Futurama are Math Majors even PHDs. So the Math Lecture is a full segment in which a Math Prof. discusses and explains the use of math in the original series as well as the new material. The lecture also explains the ALIEN SYMBOLS and even reveals a hidden character to help truly OCD fans to decode the latest symbols.Other extras include Comic-Con full-cast Futurama comicbook reading!I can't wait for the next installment of the DVD series.

Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, is the live-action (plus 2 animated cats) sequel to the 2004 movie basic on the 80's comic strip cat. Like the original this one has Bill Murray (A Life Aquatic, Ghostbusters, etc.) replacing (with distinction) the late Lorenzo Music, who provided the cats voice on the animated TV series and specials. Also back are the cutie but clueless would be couple Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle, played perfectly bland by Breckin Meyer and Liz the Vet, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt. In spite of the Dickens subtitle spoof, this one is loosely Mark Twain's Prince & the Pauper. Jon follows Liz to London, England where he plans to propose to her. The fat cat stows-away uninvited and in the perfunctory identity swap Garfield finds himself mistaken for his UK double Prince (voiced by the great Tim Curry) and lording over posh castle of four-legged subjects in his stead. The evil Lord Dargis, played by Scottish actor/comedian Bill Connolly, is next in line to inherit the estate, have evil designs to get his evil hands on the royal fortune.This one is worth seeing if only for more Murray as Garfield. Although it is surprising that the sequel was a theatrical release when the original opened for made most of its revenue from DVD sales. The studio is counting on the summer family pickings being slim until Superman Returns, but Garfield: ATOTK is still rated PG for some tame bathroom jokes. The studio also feels that when John Cleese is unavailable Tim Curry (Rocky Horror & the voice of Lemony Snicket's audio books) is the go-to-weird English guy, for the other pampered cat-currently-called Prince. I have no problem with that Curry is a delicious pansy-cat and Billy Connolly (Lemony Snicket's movie, Head of the Class) is always fun. I also have no problem with the use of recycling of (classic) plots, knowing where the stories going from the get-go makes any departure or twist that much more fun.This one, like the original is goofy, but entertaining.

You could call her a early 20th cen. template for Bridget Jones or a more innocent ancestor of the Sex & the City character of your choice...but these description fail to do justice to the surprisingly modern creation of Sally Jay Gorce "lookin' for love" in Paris. The instantly-likeable creation of 21 year old Sally Jay fresh-from-college-girl-abroad make Elaine Dundy's semi-autobiographic The Dud Avocado, a pleasure to read. A genre-making classic from 1958 has finally return to print in the US. As Sally Jay Gorce's perspective isn't always reliable, the reader isn't fooled even when SJG is attempting to fool herself. Although at times seemingly innocent and looking for some post-school living, the novel's heroin can seem far older than her year's at other times, with no cost to the narrative or loss of the reader. Elaine Dundy's ahead of it's time American-in-Paris tale holds up well enough to beg for new movie treatment. Dundy's journalist background serves her well in richly depicting the mid-century-bohemian setting. Sally Jay is so familiar, but also an excellent mystery that she herself must unravel...If you are remotely interested in the genre, the works of authors like Erica Jong, Helen Fielding or even J.D. Salinger himself, then you will want to check out "The Dud Avocado."

First let me say: Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece and the perfect way to close a franchise started in 1995. Randy Newman's "You've got a friend in me" warms the heart today as it first did 15 years ago.Now with that out of the way let me call attention to the films lead-in...Pixar continues another tradition here with is the animated short that precedes the feature (like Luxo Jr. where the Studio's logo comes from). Toy Story 3's short is called "Day & Night" and raises the bar for future Pixar shorts and will likely get many Academy nomination for it's efforts. I think the 3-D may work more effectively with the short than the sequel itself. "Day & Night" is more complicated a concept than you'd expect considering it involves two mute characters struggling to coexist. One character consists, literally of daytime images while his counterpart is made of night images. Although the two characters are little more than retro-cartoon silhouettes, they are filled with complex animated scenes within their own animation. They shift positions and move around one another creating some fascinating visuals for us. Equally simple is it's message for folks to overcome their fear of the differences in others and the unknown. Day & Night is simply the best short I've seen from Pixar to dateNow with that out of the way, Toy Story 3 reunites us with old friends: Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Hamm, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, each voiced by their original actors (except the late Jim Varney). Surprisingly, the Toys owner Andy, now grown up and ready to start college is still voiced by the same actor John Morris (who started at around 11 in the first film). It seems the concept of toys coming to life when people aren't look would become tired after 2 films, but I have to say that is not the case here. After a super opening sequence, an homage to Woody's opening adventure in the original film, the toys end up at Daycare run like a prison by a naughty Teddy Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing "3." Lot's of details sweep across the screen with everything from the Pizza Planet " Yo" truck, to all the texture of Ken's extensively stocked accessory collection (Groovy). But technical strides aside, on an emotional level the movie, like those before it, generate plenty of concern for the wellbeing of these CGI toys, again. I would go as far to say if you are not touched by the final moments of the film and Andy's goodbye, then you may want to get to a cardiologist and get yourself checked out!

The Chronicles of Narnia is an interesting "animal" in it's marketability. C.S. Lewis' allegory-laden works are more accessible, on many levels for children and church-folk. So, thus the Narnia audience is broader due to its mix of borrowed mythology and Christian imagery. This release is well timed, following the success of both the Harry Potter franchise and the Lord of the Rings "trilogy." Well-timed also because the limits of computer animation has been pushed far enough to reverently envision the world of NARNIA. But you still have to work with those darn child actors, or do you...hmm.Narnia, unlike the Lord of the Rings' Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as consistently real. The Special Effects are very mixed: the wolves are impressive and Aslan, voiced perfectly by Liam Neilson, seems infinitely more realistic than his BBC counterpart (which, many of the other creatures are rather, soulless. Some landscapes recreated on sound-stages and matte paintings are plainly artificial. While, some meshing of real and digital works. Some of these moments with the actors do not. New Zealand director Andrew Adamson, of Shrek 1 & 2, doesn't have much experience with live action movies, coming from a Special Effects background, and maybe the child actors are out of their depth when it comes to acting in front of a green-screen. A lot of "The Lord of the Rings" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the real or illusion environment. In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also awkward and foundering when asked to portray some of the more complicated scenes. But I am profoundly pleased that children were cast who look like real WWII evacs and not Sears models. As for the adult talent, the Evil White Witch, as played by Tilda Swanson was perfect performance for the genre.The film's opening shares more character insights and background than Lewis himself does, foreshadowing Edmund's selfish nature. With a brief but intense air raid on London, leading to the emotional juxtaposition of the evacuation of children to the country. Both beautiful cinematic moments not in the original text. Other classic moments that were from the text, like Lucy finding the wardrobe, were a pleasure to watch.Then of course some of the problems lie with the original material, Lewis' book. The Narnia series is heavy on allegory and a mix of global myths in the fantasy world without any important dramatic justification unlike Tolkien's work. While such a miscellaneous fairy-world work in print or in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without appearing hackneyed to today's audiences. "Chronicles" had been promoted as "a Lord of the Rings for kids" this is misleading. It may have been the intention of its makers, but not the end product.But in the end it is a FINE big screen version of a fine book series with many magical moments and I hope it does well enough in theaters and on DVD to warrant more films.

JACK IS BACK in The legend of GRIMJACK volume #2The original HARD-BOILED barbarian is back. In the ever-shifting city of Cynosure, the nexus of all realities, this merc/detective series contains the private-eye anti-hero of pulp fiction mixed with the fantasy of Robert E. Howard. GRIMJACK aka John Gaunt, published in 1983-84, is re-presented here, without the backpage MUNDEN's BAR shorts, unfortunately.THIS TRADE PAPERBACK COLLECTS THE REPRINTS OF THE MONTHLY GRIMJACK COMICS FROM OSTRANDER AND TRUMAN, now that the story arcs from the backpages of STARSLAYER have been reprinted in THE LEGEND of GRIMJACK (volume one), volume 2 begins with issue #1, "a SHADE of TRUTH" to issue #7 "SHADOWS of DOUBT"In what was the premiere issue of the monthly series, "a Shade of Truth" finds Gaunt hanging out in his bar, Munden's, when a fancy-looking woman walks in. She used to be married to William Honesworth, Cynosure's finance minister. Their daughter Marcie recently killed herself, and she wants Gaunt to find the daughter's diary so she can learn why.In "BLOOD SPORT," a kid wants to hire Gaunt for one DECICRED, the smallest coin in Cynosure. Gaunt takes the job because, he says, "NOBODY'D EVER OFFERED THEIR ENTIRE BANKROLL BEFORE." The kid's father is going to fight in the "Blood Sport", an illegal bare-knuckle deathmatch, to make some money. The kid wants Gaunt to stop him so he doesn't get killed. Gaunt takes the father's place in a match against a huge mutant called Butcherboy. This story reveals Gaunt's roots in the Pit, Cynosure's ghetto, and how got the nickname GRIMJACK. reminds Gaunt of his days as a slave in the Arena. There's some background info on the Dancer, who Gaunt knew in the Arena, and Dancer's lieutenant Mac Cabre appears as ringmaster.In "BLOOD RELATIONS," Gaunt visits with BlacJacMac, Gaunt's best bud from the Arena, to tell him his father Mac Cabre is still alive. The two of them go check out Cabre's old headquarters, and find it has been re-occupied and now holds, among other things, a dozen womb tanks each holding a clone of the Butcherboy.Then in "LEGACY" Grimjack goes Kevin Costner as he protects a comeback rock star from a psycho fan. This is the only weak story in the mix.In "DEAD END" Gaunt's old TDP, Tran-Dimensional Police, partner Roscoe wants his help in investigating the theft of some Portable Reality Generators, one of the TDP's secret edges in fighting trans-dimensional crime. The trail leads out Eternity Road to TDP biker cop Jericho Noleski, who rescues Gaunt from a shootout at Dead End Station. "SHADOW COPS" and "SHADOWS of DOUBT" concludes the Cynosure cop conspiracy story arc.The Trade paperback includes a gallery of the original cover art and a new cover by Tim Truman. The original art here isn't as strong as Truman's new work in GRIMJACK: KILLER INSTINCT. But the stories here define John Gaunt by introducing the key players, by sharing his childhood in the pit, outlining his time with Cynosure's police dept and his haunted history.

A made for HBO tribute to 40's pulp fiction and Lovecraft's mythos, this Detective Lovecraft , like the protagonist in Hammett's Maltese Falcon, is looking for an 'item' the Lovecraftian twist here has that item being the Necronomicon. The story is set in a Chicago of the 40's in which magic and the conveniences of the period are merged, everyone uses magic, except Phillip Lovecraft. I gotta think that Jim Butcher was inspired to create Harry Dresden after seeing this, although Dresden is less reluctant to work magic.Hope this comes to DvD soon, the sequel as well, a recast WitchHunt, with Hopper as Lovecraft.

When a movie officially gains Classic status by turning twenty, winning an Oscar (or actually being good) it's bound to be remade ... So the late Dudley Moore's beloved drunken shoes are filled by an equally pathetic and lovable Russell Brand as the billionaire who must marry a rich girl to keep his inheritance. Sir John Gielgud's iconic butler, replaced adequately by Helen Mirren as Arthur's babysitter/ surrogate and someone to play off of. The intro to Arthur's true love is suspiciously changed from tie-shoplifting, I think in light of Rehabbed-Celebs, and Liza Minnelli's hard-working waitress-actress-wannabe Linda, becomes Naomi, a self-proclaimed tour guide, played by Greta Gerwig, with dreams to write and illustrate a children's book. Same dilemma, Arthur must choose between Love and Money...Man-up and choose= Love, becoming as penniless as Naomi or Money= marrying the rich girl he doesn't. Its clear, whether you've seen the original how things will end (She's HIS toad) but the film is cute, funny and sometimes moving. Mirren and Brand have a solid dynamic, perhaps more so than his love interest, Jennifer Garner does a great job as the greed-driven would be bride, funny as well. Overall, an ok movie, remake or not, not super, but for the pre-Summer wasteland...Wet sandwiches & no iced tea.Although, must-see moment the Opening min. with Brand loading Utility-belt...comedy gold.

I'm a Huge fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars Books and the Mars art of Frank Frazetta too, so this sword & martian Princess-lousy project is dear too me. Without Carter there would never have been a Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers, but as result the promise seems cliched now, Hell!..even Superman's super leaping is direct from JC, Lucas' flying sand barges & Leia's Princess of Mars look... all ERB.... in addition to that concern the project has changed hands so many times since 2004, Robert Rodriguez who upon leaving the Directors Guild became ineligible, then kerry Conrad, the director of the retro "Sky Capt. Film" ,the late Frazetta was on board , the initial budget was 100 mil , currently Jon Favreau was replaced by Andrew Stanton (who may never have directed a live action film before). So I'm concerned. Over all great stuff, sadly for DvD it needs to be seen on a big screen, Mostly the story sticks to the Princess of Mar story that introduces John Carter, an ex-confederate soldier to Mars a.k.a. BARSOOM and to super powers maybe even a new cause to fight for.

Don't be left out on the sidewalk or on your local inner-city equestrian statue...just don't be left out! The Pigeon books are always great fun. Pigeon returns to make more demands, while "the man" is always keeping him down. Mo Willems creator of "DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS," "PIGEON FINDS A HOT DOG" and " Knuffle BUNNY" does it again!Willems combines his flair for simplistic childlike design, with the preschooler's stubbornness via the PIGEON. The Pigeon demands and fumes building to a crescendo, upon which his delivers his obligatory RANT, the climax of the Pigeon Book formula (see the aforementioned books). This "Pigeon" pattern provides satisfactory continuity for preschool listeners and early readers.I highly recommend ANY of the PIGEON books! My children insist on so many re-readings they could easily deliver performances of the stories without the books. Willems clearly connects to the young through this determined character, in a manner that rivals Dr. Seuss himself, without the flowery faux words (no offense Doc, you know I luv ya). As it is with all great children's books the reader can easily see themselves in the PIGEON.Even a cameo by Knuffle Bunny!

The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous and recognizable portraits ever painted, so it is appropriate that it is tied to one of the most recognizable pieces of fiction to come along in decades. The painting remains the subject of speculation; some believe Leonardo used himself as a model, others that the woman was a mistress of his patrons. The Da Vinci code creates much the same amount of speculation. Like viewing the enigmatic work by Leonardo in which the exchange between the viewer and the work itself is mesmerizing, engrossing, so it is with the Da Vinci Code. The blockbuster screen version of the historically successful-best-selling book about the frantic Euro-scavenger hunt to unlock a 2000-year-old secret. You must know the story by now it's been on the best-seller list longer than the last 2 Potter books. Okay, just incase...World-renowned Harvard symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) is called to a murder investigation, of which he becomes a suspect in, at the Louvre Museum. The museum curator has been murdered, turning his remains into a living symbol, well not living, turning his remains into a symbol that will lead Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on the run and on a trail of clues and symbols leading to many secrets worked into the art of Leonardo Da Vinci, tied to a secret society dedicated to guarding the ancient secret. I know even if you haven't read it or seen.The Movie, like the book, has all the style and traditional suspense elements that make a movie of the genre work as an entertaining narrative, taking the viewer along with confidence that it is going one almost mainstream way (really? Secret societies & killer albino monks!!), then surprising you when it doesn't. It feels real familiar as a thriller then events twist and turn another way.The international cast is lead by 2-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, who, with his stringy academic hair, embodies Dan Brown's protagonist for the film. Symbologist Robert Langdon is described early in the novel as being sort of a "Harrison Ford in Harris tweed" and Hanks is a solid choice (inspite of the fact that I would like to see Director Ron Howard draw from outside his personal actor's pool, casting an unknown is always a gamble). Langdon is the thinkin' man's hero, relentless in his quest to seek out the truth. Audrey Tautou , plays Sophie Neveu, the strong partner with just as much personal as well as proffession at stake in solving the mystery. Also in Howard's ensemble cast is Sir Ian McKellen who delivers his typically brilliant portrayal as the enigmatic Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany, who appeared in Howard's Beautiful Mind, plays the bizarre monk Silas. Finally Jean Reno, plays French police captain Bezu Fach, a part written for Reno, literally, Dan Brown wrote the character with the French actor in mind!! Lastly but not least, Alfred "throw me the idol" Molina (Doc Oct in Spiderman 2) plays the Bishop Aringarosa with creepy distinction.Be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel and part of the fuss over it has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.See it, if for nothing other than to see the amazing BONDish locations, historical attractions and real (sometimes) works of art featured in the film. Location including: Paris' Musee du Louvre (the footage of the Louvre at night is beautiful), the Temple Church (of the Knights Templar), Westminster Abbey, Lincoln Cathedral (London) , Rosslyn Chapel (Scotland), Lincolnshire substituting for Castle Gandolfo, the Mediterranean island of Malta. Locations and art included give a much-needed authenticity that would have been lost on a backlot or soundstage shoot.Overall the film is definitely worth the price of admission but, be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel. Part of the fuss over CODE has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church. This may anger Christians in general, Catholics in particular, especially those not willing to treat the film as fiction based on controversial theory. I for one am a Roman Catholic and find the material, of both the film and novel, fascinating and worth my time.Another warning due to the complicated exposition of the story the Da Vinci Code runs over 2 hours and many plot points necessary cause the film to drag at times. It has a Pg-13 rating for violence, some sexual content, brief drug references and disturbing images and themes.Lastly, I recommend that other Christians and Catholics (with serious inquires) take advantage of the excitement (good or bad) generated by this movie and use the opportunity it provides for church dialogue. Many churches have responded positively (and some negatively) by arming their congregations with their history and theology, along with strategies to spread their faith. That is what good books and movies should do: inspire people to think and ask interesting questions.

This short story arc was part of 3 connected arc, infact the VHS version combined this one with "Genesis of the Daleks" for a two cassette set. If you are new to Dr. Who this could be a weak place to start, for example:--no TARDIS, the Doctor and companions Sarah & Harry are Transmatted to the surface of a nearly uninhabited future Earth leaving the TARDIS behind on a spacestation, then transmatt again at the end. The story maybe historical in the fact the the famous Police Call-Box never appears This is followed by the second and last time that this happens in Genesis, in which they are intercepted by the Timelords, then leave with a Timering, catching up with the TARDIS in the final story Revenge of the Cyber-men.--Another omission that may confuse the unintiated in viewing this story arc is that upon the climax the Doctor claims to be the Human "warrior class" to confuse the Sontaran advanced scout, but there is no referance that would establish otherwise if you are just starting out. In fact in the 70's when alot of American was just meeting the Timelord for the first time this may have been their first encounter with the series. I was one of those people, but it was "Revenge" that hooked me with the Cyber-men and eventually the arrival of the TARDIS.Inspite of this it is a fun story, some pretty location, no quarries and the retrospective extra with the Sontarans is well done.

Pencils ready?.........The Galactic Federation becomes embroiled in a war with Galaxy 5, Peladon becomes strategically important, being rich in a mineral vital to the war effort. Fed tech is brought in to speed things up, but only end up adding to the escalating clash between Peladon's old ways and new. Then add to that there's the ghostly visage of Aggedor appears attacking miners. Naturally this is when the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive, missing the Citadel again, some 50 years since the Doctor's visit with Jo. The Queen, the Daughter of the late King Peladon (of the Curse of Peladon) knows of the Doctor from her father, enlists him to find the cause of the manifestations of Aggedor. He guesses someone is deliberately trying to interrupt Trisilicate production, be it saboteurs or spooks, they seem to have succeeded when the miners decide to strike, then before long attack the Federation armory to get weapons. This further sets back Trisilicate supplies, so a human engineer in charge of the refinery, sends for Federation troops to help restore order. None of the involved parties want Federation occupation, especially when the ICE WARRIORS implement some ruthless Martian tactics. Martian ICE LORD Commander Azaxyr sole objective is to maintain Trisilicate production at all costs, creating political realignment: the Plebs and Patricians join forces in seeking to rid the planet of the Martians. Except for a raving MINER attempts to blow up the Citadel allowing for the Ice Warriors to impose martial law on the capital, imprisoning the Queen and her courtiers, and even killing another Peladonian Chancellor (wonder if this is in the job description)...then it gets complicated....well everything sorts itself out with some help from the Doctor and Sarah.There are still some painfully cheesy moments, such as Sarah Jane explaining "Women's Lib" to the Queen, "There's nothing "only" about being a girl." Also the Doctor's hilarious `rassling match with the Miner Ettis in which it is clearly the late-great stuntman Terry Walsh and not Pertwee, but while "Monster's" plot is seems unnecessarily over-complicated, like it's predecessor "Curse" the enthusiasm for the material shines though all of the missteps. I guess the same can be said for all Classic Dr. Who.Another important (atleast to me) note: the voice of Alpha Centauri is again played by Ysanne Churchman worked as an actress on British radio, TV and film (returns as the Voice to voice the Spiders in Planet of the Spiders for the end of this season). She is my favorite thing about the Peladon stories, de-lightful!More Peladonian Drinking Games:Drink whenever you see.....-a stalagmite or stalactite ("another rotten, gloomy, old, tunnel")-a Venusian Karate Chop or hear a Venusian Lullaby.-the Doctor call someone dear "FELLOW" or old "CHAP"-the Doctor drop-names.-Sarah complains about being left to "twiddle her thumbs" or whenever she actually "twiddles her thumbs."-good ole ALPHA CENTAURI again "Cheers!"-good ole AGGEDOR again "Cheers!"

The show we fondly remember with Meeno Peluce as Jeff the "smart-kid" who listened in school and the well-intentioned but historically inept Bogg played by the late Jon-Erik Hexum. Jeff serves as their only guide through time, fixing history. Much like the "Magic Tree House" series serves today as an elementary students overview of pop history, Voyagers! is flashing or particularly clever, but it remains surprisingly "timely" in the family-sci-fi genre. The music may be as over-the-top as some of the dialogue, at times formulaic, over all, still a great show.We've got a green light, kids!

Let's start with what this book isn't: It isn't really a sequel to his autobiography, If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor. It isn't really a memoir.It isn't really an "autobiographical novel". Campbell is the lead character in the story and some of the stuff in the book could have actually happened. It ain't literature, but WHAT IT IS: is a fun, fast, read with MAD-like graphics throughout the book. "Make Love" is the story of Campbell's series unfortunate events in preparing for an A-list film with Richard Gere and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, while gradually turning the production into a B movie.Campbell has a great storytelling voice, sort of the poor-man's Mark Twain, who never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Campbells depiction of "real" stars is insanely funny, but begs the question: what do these A-list stars think of the book?(he makes no apologies or acknowledgments, save the flap copy) The novel tells of his chance to break out of the genre films as he becomes the voice of everyman and the guy's guy on the set.For fans of Campbell, best known for the cult-favs Evil Dead / Xena / Brisco County Jr./ etc, this is a must read.

Before the soap really breaks out to it's Supernatural direction...cheesy TV soap from the 60's from Dan Curtis, the creator of the Night Stalker series ... Intended to be Wuthering Hts drama, for about 200 episodes before a supernatural character takes over ... Namely Barnabus Collins the vampire. Then all bets are off, we get witches, werewolves, golems, phoenixes and ghosts galore. Surprisingly timely now that the period supernaturals (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies) are so hip... Curtis' original Dark Shadows is Delightfully low budget... And on mostly live daytime tv time constraints there are lots of mistakes... And why it rocks. When compared to the mind-numbing mediocrity of most on screen scenes the descriptions of Barnabas' hinted off-screen exploits are amazingly dynamic... Like the ransacking of the doctor's office to get Maggie's blood sample. In typical soap fashion story-lines creep along taking appalling amounts of time to climax.

"He's a DOG and he's somebody's DAD!" That's how my 5 year old enthusiastically described THE SHAGGY DOG after seeing a TV spot. Before seeing the film itself, she had succinctly and accurately summed-up the movie's simplistic plot.This latest Disney remake, using, the SHAGGY DOG franchise, sort of combining elements of the first film and it's sequel, an average Joe starts becoming a shaggy dog. This will rope in three generations of Disney audiences:1.)Those who FONDLY remember Fred MacMurray's allergic-dog-hatin' mailman, whose son Wilby trades places w/ the neighbor's sheepdog in the 1959 classic The Shaggy Dog.2.)Those who FONDLY remember Dean Jones as Wilby grown up and still trading places with a local shaggy dog in the 1976 classic The Shaggy D.A.3.)Those who FONDLY remember the CGI laden commercials for the 2006 remake of the Shaggy Dog w/ Buzz Lightyear himself, Tim Allen.This generation (3.) has come to know Tim Allen as the face of multiple Disney fam. fare ( the Santa Clauses, the Toy Stories), in the same way that past generations came to know Fred MacMurry (the Flubber originals) and Dean Jones (the Herbie originals)...in a word: FONDLY. Allen is the likable, out of his depth, DAD-figure that stuff happens to (like Robin Williams in his live-action Disney outings). Here he is an (you-guessed-it) Assistant D.A.,who is more involved with his "big case" than his family, while the "shaggy transformation" he undergoes actually helps reconnect him. He sells the ludicrous scenario and makes it funny for the same reason his predecessors did: because we like them. THIS IS THE MODERN-EQUIVALENT of the ones we saw AND LOVED AS KIDS, with the addition of butt jokes and random acts of chaos (e.g. the inadvertent waylaying of resident old lady). OH YEAH! My daughters (5 and 8) were so ready to see this one!Definitely a good goofy one for the fam.You're not gonna see this one on next year's Oscars, but you might see it on your DVD shelf.

This was really well done, the writers strike probably cost this series it's sophomore season, Michelle Ryan wad lovely and likable , what a great American accent. The producers of Battlestar loaded this revival with lots of subplots and Galactica cast members... Especially Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck ) who steals scenes as the bionic prototype gone bad. Ryan's older sister cliches are improved by the secret life angle, over all a fun series.

Dungeons and Dodecahedrons! Somebody call Gary Gygax's estate! Meglos Is on DvD at last! An early story arc from season 18, Tom Baker's final season... In case the plum duds and the new wave opening didn't tip you off...."1st things first, but not necessarily in that order"...Seriously this is a favorite of mine, maybe it's the quirkiness of the bad guys or the stereo-typicalness of the religious zealots, or even the random Aurhur Dent-like Earth-man tossed in the mix, but's worth seeing and owning. Someone must agree with me because the title villain turned up in and early Draft of 'The Lodger' from series 5 last year.The story takes place mostly on two worlds in the same star system...1) Zolfa-Thura, a desert world devoid seemingly of life structures bar five giant screens; 2) Tigella, a jungle world inhabited by the white Beatle-haired Tigellans, themselves divided by 2 castes, one Tech-minded, the other intensely faithful to a enigmatic 12 sidedPower source. An old friend of the Doctor invites him to Ti-whatzit to mediate a religious/technological despite, only Meglos accepts the invitation instead, as the Doctor's Doppler and with his own designs. So when the real Doctor arrives the mistaken identity hilarity ensues worthy of Shakespeare or maybe Star Trek.The story has some of my favorite music ( like the techno sacrifice hooks), make-up (like the cactus faced Tom Baker) Banter (especially between the mercenaries) and cameos (i.e. Jacqueline Hill as Lexa the leader of the Deons who was the First Doctor's companions Barbara Wright way back from the shows very first episode, y'all !)Meglos Drinking Games, drink whenever:..."K9's probe circuit is jammed."or "He has his tail Waggled."...whenever a title character says, "Chronic Hysteresis," "Dodecahedron" "Tigella" or, why the Hell, even "Zolfa-Thura.""...If you experience any "Deja Vu "of your own during any part of the story.... Whenever mercenary "General Grugger's hat enters the room."

The 4th Doctor's penultimate season (17th) after Tom Baker's long run as the Timelord (1974-81) is a shakey one, full of kooky and cheesy stories. "Horns of the Nimon" is one of the cheesiest ...although season opener "Destiny of the Daleks" is close. And as Douglas Adams' Shada was never aired Nimon represents the end of that season as well. Thank goodness the new series has stepped up the notion of the season closer. But teasing aside, I still enjoyed this story, Tom Baker's Doctor, still as highly regarded as any of the current actor's to play the role and is always a pleasure to watch. His rapport with Lalla Ward is a bonus, shame they could maintain that rapport off camera in their short-lived marriage (You will notice that the usually reliable Baker is absent from the DVD commentary track, but Ward is onboard).Released in the UK as a Myths & Legends set including the Time Monster and Underworld both Greek myth heavy stories, "Horns" is the story of an advance culture taking advantage of a lesser one, but in turn they themselves are being set up by an even more advance and aggressive culture. The Doctor happens upon a broken down Skonnan ship mid journey delivering ` Tribute' of young sacrifices and radioactive hymetusite crystals, both of which they are obtaining from the nearby planet Aneth to the Nimon, a higher being on their world, unknowingly delivering their own world to his race of galactic parasites. The UPSHOT: The bull-headed Nimon send a lone representative to an unsuspecting world, offering aid in order to gaining the trust of its inhabitants, before arriving in force to pillage its resources. The Doctor and Romana stumble upon a world which has already fallen to the Nimon linked to Skonnos by a space tunnel through which the Nimons cross from one planet to the next, fueled by the very hymetusite taken from Aneth. Like the Minotaur of legend (which the Doctor claims to have been involved) the Nimon's power complex is labyrinthine with the maze shifting and changing shape. Naturally, this is where the finale takes place, w/K9 stacking the deck.Even as a kid the noise of the handful extras stomping around the metal grating of the Skonnan Complex served only to call attention the spare numbers. But then again here the Skonnan culture is intended to be an old ailing empire desperate to reclaim old glory...so a handful of soldier stomping around the Complex is just what they'd have. But it is hard to excuse the look of the Nimons or that the race is represented by three skinny limbed, enormous headed, platform shoed monsters (even after the invasion begins.)On the plus side and the final reason you should get this DVD.... Soldeed! The apparent leader of the misguided Skonnan Empire is played soooo amazingly over-the-top by Graham Crowden. Every line drips of the stage.... "Lord Niiimon! It is I....SOLDEED!" and he actually calls Roman "a hussy!" But gems like "my dreams of conquest" and ".....you are all doomed" are simply genius !!! Crowden gives what is, in my humble opinion "the best death scene ever in DW history!"Some Nimon Drinking Games:Drink whenever....... the co-pilot calls the Aneth sacrifices "weakling scum!"...someone pulls out a sonic screwdriver ( Romana ever has her own in this one, which the Doctor promptly pilfers )....Hymetusite is seen or mentionedThe Doctor says...."What could possible go wrong?"....SOLDEED says "Lord NIMON" his own name or "Meddlesome hussy ."...someone says "IN THE NAME OF THE 2ND SKONNAN EMPIRE" and "THE GREAT JOURNEY OF LIFE."...we see a NIMON....the Doctor covers K9's mouth (this doesn't happen enough in this season)...the Nimon assures us that "the Program will continue!"... SETH's girlfriend Teka, tells us what he's gonna do to the Nimon, yikes!

J.J.Abram's boldly tells the story of those civilians who flee the city under giant monster attack from all those films in the 50's. The classic and contemporary Godzilla movies tell the story from the scientist and the army's perspective, never the little guy, only the big picture. "Cloverfield" focuses on those little guys and sells it by having the film done in blocks of "real time" video, which must be difficult to orchestrate on such mass extra fleeing-scenes. This is plenty brave to have a major picture without any major stars (another aspect that adds an edge of reality to the project), without music soundtrack (naturally, although Godzilla fans should stay for the end credits which include a revamp of the "Tokyo Evacuation March") and the boldest aspect: without a camera tripod. Like `em or hate `em there's little time to worry about that as the pace of the film is pretty rapid, and overall the film is a trim hour and a half (probably the best given the unorthodox visuals). Naturally, there's no "big" explaination offered or omniscient narration to clear things up, but honestly would the "little guy" really get one? I'm still waiting on the tidy epilogue following Katrina.The big question: How does the monster look?The Answer: Pretty cool, pretty original, but it really is less the point, than the reactions mand behavior of our fleeing cast. And just to make things creepy--er, there are smaller critters to be found in Manhattan in addition to the daddy-mama-monster.Again, "Cloverfield" is the tale of some survivors of a giant-monster attack, survivors who need some advice on how to behave in a monster movie:1.) Never go BACK into the city, during the evacuation2.) Never take the Subway tunnel to go BACK into the city during evac.3.) Once in the subway tunnels, follow the fleeing rats!4.) Monster bites are bad!5.) Listen to the army guys.6.) Don't try to video tape the entire event.Pre- or post film prep, check out the faux-Myspace pages of some of the major players. Try www.myspace.com/robbyhawkins for starters, you can get to other characters' pages from there.

Director Barry Sonnefield has a body of funny work behind him: Adams Family & Adams Family Values, MIB (1&2), Wild Wild West, as well as a quirky body of work as a producer and cinematographer like 3 `0 clock High, Raising Arizona, Lemon Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. So a film, in which he has the chance to direct the "phenomenal cosmic power" of Robin Williams targeting the family demographic, is in well-charted, extremely safe waters. That is what RV, a film guaranteed to make you laugh, but with no inspirations to do more. Ultimately a wasted of Williams comic genius, but the family vacation disaster comedy is an industry money-making staple delivering an evening of entertainment, if not a legacy for Williams' or Sonnefield's career. The film does invite comparison with National Lampoon's 1983 classic Vacation. Chevy Chase like Williams makes disastrous vacation plans without the family's consent. Another comparison within the genre is older still, in the 50's Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez made a Technicolor dud called "The Long, Long Trailer" in which (you guessed it) vacation plans go bad. Most recently you could add: "Cheaper by the Dozen II." "Meet the Fockers" and "Are We there yet?"In RV, Williams plays Bob Munro, dad who is forced to cancel a family trip to Hawaii, like Chase's Griswold, instead renting a recreation vehicle or RV (get it) to travel to Boulder, Colorado (ironically the place Williams "began" his career as the adopted home of MORK & MINDY, I know it wasn't really shot in Colorado). With so familiar a concept the predictability of this movie sets in almost immediately after the RV rental. The viewer is ready for things are going to go wrong and boy does it. Munro can't drive it or even work the seatbelt, dishes fall out of the cabinets, the parking brake is broken, the stove doesn't heat up, the sewage line backs up providing landmark potty-humor, and more.Of course, along the way, they meet the obligatory pest family lead by Travis Gornike (Jeff Daniels), is a welcome diversion, for the audience anyway. Williams continues to get into more outrageous scenerios, lost laptops, fightin' `coons (surreal animal action is always a crowd pleaser), lost in the mountains, near loss of life and limb, anything imaginable to wreck the Winnebago, contend with the camper community and learn a lesson on the journey. In the end, most of the talent involved here, could have done better, Robin Williams alone without a script could carry a 90 min. film, but this one maybe would have been funnier as just a "long, long trailer."

Scary and moving....A really good Dr. Who special with aired following season 4, the Doctor borders on complete inaction worthy of Tennant's Hamlet here because of the sheer scale of future events tied to the deaths of these individuals... But his 360 degree turn is both awesome and terrifying ! Lines are crossed as he nears the end of his 10th regeneration.

"Too Fab for words" are the words the best describe Jon Pertwee as the third incarnation of the Doctor-in "The Green Death" originally broadcast in May 1973, is painfully dated. Since many of the 3rd Doctor's adventures are set in a specific era, the Doctor's exile in the 70's we accept and expect it to be filled with vegetarian hippies dropping out and sticking it to "the man" of global conspiracies, mad "supercomputers" and the groovy, Doctor encountering green-glowing giant maggots.This story, along with it's still-timely, prophetic, environmental message and warnings of globalization and pollution overshadowed by the "reasonable for the date" special effects-including the stop-motion photography of the maggots and the front-axial projection used for the pulsating skin on the miners.Jo Grant, the 3rd Doctor's second assistant, leaves the nest by the end of this one finding her Lennon-ish, soul-mate in what she describes as a sort of younger version of the Doctor, a description which he more or less takes in his stride. This new dynamic makes for some interesting scenes that make this story worth seeing. At times the Doctor seems deeply hurt that Jo has interests outside of his invitation to tour with him in the newly restored TARDIS (since the "3 Doctors", he is able to leave the Earth). Also, the Doctor, almost paternally, runs interference for the grief-stricken Jo when she may do more than stay-up and read with the good Dr. Jones.We later learn in the Planet of Spiders, the 3rd Doctor's final story, that the Doctor gave Jo and Dr. Jones the Blue Crystal as a wedding gift and they did indeed end up exploring the Amazon. All in all, "Green Death" has a lot to offer fans of the 3rd Doctor.

You know how reviews sometimes go, "...if you liked that, you'll love this!" well this might be one of those reviews. I did enjoy the 2001 TMNT. Of the improvements I did wish for, more players (like the old coin-op Turtle game) was at the top of my hypothetical list. And may I say, "boy does TMNT 2:Battle Nexus deliver that one!" And if "More settings and scenes" was on that increasingly imaginary list of mine, then Battle Nexus is on that one too! So many settings, in fact, that the Game Cube ed. has 2 discs, although part of the need for extra space may come from the hidden "Arcade TMNT game" and other extras like multiple Tournaments. The actual game play isn't as smooth as in the 2001 version, but the graphics are better and hooks like player grades and MVP awards are excellent distractions.

The 1973 Filmation series reunited the original cast before the film series...so it can be bad, right? It took advantage of the animated media to put "another" alien on the bridge, to up the ante on the scale of the foes and the space battles. On the down side it was Filmation, and the look is far from mold-breaking, the sound fx are at times familiar,and at times cheesy stock sound from Filmation. But the primary colors are as much a joy here as in the original series. I for one welcome back the animated series, with fond memories of see more than just Star Trek reruns for the first time.

Sorry about the title, mine and theirs (considering Lindsay's predilection to party), but Herbie: Fully Loaded is a great addition to Disney's Love Bug series. We counted the days 'til the release; we even met Herbie and his driver during their national promotional tour. I wanted my daughters to share in my childhood affection for the beetle. I must admit to some trepidation not only to Lindsay Lohan's inclusion in the project, but to the potentially overpowering CGI Herbie like WB's live-action DOOs. But good news, the animation is well balanced and timely. The film pays tribute to its film roots while infusing itself with enough 21st cen. references to make it appealing the next generation.If connects Herbie to the NASCAR industry, including some driver cameos (they're easy to spot: just look for the strained, cheesy acting. Sorry guys). How's this for mod refs there's even street racing and monster trucks. Herbie attitude, especially about his appearance, hasn't changed. In one of my favorite moments in the film Herbie "keys" the bad guy Matt Dillion's beautiful racecar with his appendage-like mirror! Herbie is still a love machine, flirting with VWs a quarter of his age, still hustling to get the protagonists together. "Fully Loaded" uses lots of gimmicky racing split screens and quarter screens to great effect. The movie's music, old and new, retro and original, meshes nicely with each scene. Overall, Herbie: Fully Loaded is a great family film and great addition to Herbie's track record. Also check out the lesser known 1997 remake "The Love Bug" with Bruce Campbell and a cameo by Dean Jones.

Robert Downey Jr. may not seem to fit the superhero archetype, but he is the quintessential TONY STARK! Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes. Why not the Avengers, too?Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!

IN A DEACADE in which it is cool to hate the FRENCH, remaking THE PINK PANTHER seems a natural. What isn't natural is making the film without director BLAKE EDWARDS (Skin Deep, Sunset, Victor / Victoria) : Offensive stereotypes, less than PC plotlines and of course old Hollywood's even less PC treatment of the women's roles.What of replacing the Inspector himself? What about PETER SELLERS, the original Inspector Clouseau, how can you replace him, in spite of the Trail / the Curse / the Son of the PINK PANTHER having been completed after Seller's passing. Who can fill those shoes? STEVE MARTIN? Maybe. Martin IS a GENIUS of physical comedy; he can do a stupid French accent almost as well as Kevin Kline (what he's in this too, wow!) What about the Chief (Inspector Dreyfus)? Yep, Kline is Clouseau's nemesis and boss. And CATO, sorry, without Edwards to champion "all things un-PC" we lose Burt Kwouk's clever Asian "house-boy", who is replaced by Jean Reno (The Professional) as Clouseau's partner and a satisfying straight-man, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton. Reno, like CATO is instructed by Clouseau to hone his skills by hilariously attacking him whenever possible(this time in reverse).The Story (or lack thereof): After a televised murder of French National Soccer team head coach Yves Gluant (Jason Statham of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), where the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen Clouseau is called in to "investigate." Chief Inspector Dreyfus has picked Clouseau because he is sure to distract the media & mess up the high profile case, so that Dreyfus, can solve the case himself and win France's highest award: "Ze Medal of `onor." Beyonc? Knowles is cast as a pop-singer (quite a stretch there) & girlfriend of the victim, also the femme fatal of the movie who everyone thinks "did it" except Inspector Clouseau: "LEAVE HER ALONE! CAN'T YOU ZEE SHE'S ZEXY?!?!" She sure is Inspector! The late Edwards would have approved. Another hottie Blake Edwards would have included had he made this one is Clouseau's secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) another excellent physical comedian. As displayed in her "too close for comfort" scenes with Clouseau. Although the character is another painfully clich?d stereotype, "the girl who is beautiful when see takes off her glasses."Steve Martin plays Clouseau as the late SELLERS (and the late DON ADAMS in GET SMART & the animated INSPECTOR GADGET) did before him: as a moron impressed with his own genius creating chaos and destruction wherever he goes, yet still managing to "solve" the case in the end.. Some good throwaway moments of the movie are scenes where you watch Clouseau struggle with English & etiquette. Like the new Star Wars movies, familiar tunes and visuals tie us to the original saga: the animated Pink Panther & Henry Mancini's immortal theme were both used this way to adequate effect. What isn't familiar about this remake is the absence of foreign-film-feel that Blake Edwards achieved so brilliantly throughout all of the original films. New PANTHER director SHAWN LEVY, who worked with MARTIN in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (1& 2), is no stranger to the scene crumbling chaos necessary to let Clouseau be himself. Here he comes through in the PINK, as in the previously mentioned works with another lightweight, moderately-family-friendly-fare (e.g. crude and suggestive humor, fart jokes and language.)This is a funny remake of the classic film series. If you are familiar with the originals it will make you want to put them on. If you're not familiar with the original PINK PANTHER series check them out. In addition to the Pink Panther, there is: SHOT in the DARK, The Revenge of the PINK PANTHER, The PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, (also filmed by Edwards, some with clips of the late Peter Sellers, some with filler-fools, but none quite as good as the first 5 films: "the TRAIL of the PINK PANTHER," "the CURSE of the PINK PANTHER," and "SON of the PINK PANTHER.") Go ahead and INSPECT them all!

Maybe I expected too much, having enjoyed James Juceno's other works, or maybe I expected too much from such an well-titled novel set during the gap between the SW Saga's 2 film trilogies.Ultimately, I found this a weakly written story with no real contribution to the Star Wars film series continuity or to that of the books. Also the author/publisher's jacket color choices are too similar to the novelization of Episode 3, probably generating some confusion-based sales (leaving no doubt disappointed buyers).

The Doctor Who Invisible Enemy / K9 set that is just on its way out, contains "K9 & Co." the introduction to K9 mark III. and the Christmas special that didn't fly as a Dr. Who spin-off in the 80's. But leave it the 2005's DW producer Russell T. Davies to get not one but 2 spin-off successful off the ground (both are working on season 2's as we speak, well..."read"). The continuing adventures of the best companion in the 40 years of Doctor Who...in my humble opinion...Elisabeth Sladen still has "IT." Having see loads of space and time travel following her first meeting with the 3rd Doctor in Time Warrior (who she immediately assumes is the root of kidnappings she's investigating) they soon become the best of friends and a team to continue into his 4th incarnation, then later meeting the 5th, and most recently the 10th in School Reunion revealing what happens to a companion who is "left behind" by the Doctor. She's witnessed the creation of the Daleks, she seen plenty with the Doctor. Her individual adventures show to be well, "spooky" for having traveled with the Timelord, maybe having lost some humanity (like Rose's mum suggests is happening to her), but she grows over the course of the SJ Adventure series (and the Season 4 finally).The monsters of the series, some old, some new, some new and old, are okay...interesting and benign enough that there is no true horror, as Sarah's companions are barely in jr. high, it seems inappropriate for the danger to be to much...but the stakes do get pretty high over the course of the series, building to a climax of planetary proportions....and super cameo at the end (no not the Doctor!) The SJ Adventures' TARGET AUDIENCE is neatly below Dr. Who's family audience, but with enough scares to make it work for the being the sofa crowd. My 6 year old was hooked, less so with my 10 year old, both who love DW (old and new), and they understand the SARAH JANE was my "ROSE" and that connection with it's roots means plenty. So as a stand alone project...I'd say 3 stars if fair...but if we evaluate it as fans (and parents), I'd make it 4 stars. which if pretty good for a fledgling series and a spin-off no less.....plenty that's cringe-worthy and not enough of the "TIN DOG".There's also some nice links to the Season 4 of Doctor Who....like Luke's origin and the Time Beetle from "Left Turn" is a minion of a creature faced by SJS in her initial season here.One Question....does this set include the pilot special "INVASION OF BANE"which was released by itself on DVD, atleast on region 2. I'm assuming what is considered season 1 is including the pilot. If anyone knows for sure please add a comment.

From TIM JOHNSON, the Director who brought you ANTZ, oh maybe I shouldn't have started that way......DreamWorks' animated film, "Over the Hedge," is a backyard ecological comedy outfitted with some fine, silly slapstick and clever animal characters. This one is aimed more at a younger audience than other DW efforts like "Shrek" but has plenty of entertainment value for the rest of the fam. Unlike Pixar, DreamWorks isn't pushing the envelope with their animation. DW is playing it safe here with a PC comedy that delivers an ecological message while pitching family values to the extreme. The CG animation is routine, but writer Len Blum (Pink Panther) along with Lorne Cameron, working from the popular comic strip and character animators under the supervision of directors Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick do a crackerjack job of filling the screen with lively, ingratiating creatures. The comic strip Created by Michael Fry and T Lewis, OVER the HEDGE takes a quirky view of suburban living from the perspective of the animals who lived there first. The comic strip, like the movie, stars RJ, a mischievous raccoon, and Verne, his sensitive best-buddy turtle. Together they ponder life and adapt their natural habitat to incorporate all the "unnatural" creature comforts that suburbia has to offer. Fry & Lewis have written an original screenplay for the film.RJ (voiced perfectly by Bruce Willis, why hasn't he done this before, oh yeah the "Look Who's Talking" movies count), arrives in a woods outside a midwest town, excited about the wonders that living near humans can bring. He finds instead a community of porcupines, possums, a squirrel, skunk and chipmunks that is deathly afraid of humans, after their leader, Vern (Gary Shandling), has had a BAD EXPERIENCE with human boys. As they get closer and closer to humans, however, their comfortable lives in the woods appears to be at an end. Motivated by RJ, however, the animals slowly breech the hedge that separates them from the brand new housing development that has destroyed their food source over the winter while they were sleeping, and RJ shows them is a world where humans throw all sorts of food away in big metal canisters, ripe for the taking. By combining RJ plans and the family's foraging talents, maybe they can fill next winter's larder in time to meet the deadline imposed by grizzly bear (Nick Nolte). When the family makes it over THE HEDGE -- well, through it -- they pilfer, led by Hammy, an overcaffeinated squirrel (Steve Carell) who is fightingly similar to the Hoodwinked overcaffeinated squirrel not voiced by Steve Carell. This leads the humans to call pest control: Dwayne the Verminator (Thomas Haden Church).This story sets in motion more than enough comic action sequences to fill the movie's 84 minutes. The final caper mimics and rivals the "Mission: Impossible" films' derring-do to hilarious results.Character animators beautifully marry their creatures to the voice actors' individual eccentricities. Especially noteworthy are William Shatner (that's Capt. Kirk kids) uses his panache for dieing as Ozzie the possum, Wanda Sykes' slinky skunk, Carell (the Office, 40 yr Old Virgin) is always brilliant and his hyperactive Hammy is no exception , Omid Djalili's Persian housecat, SCTV alums Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as Lou & Penny.Fans of the original comic strip as well as animation devotees will appreciate this film more than the average moviegoer, but overall OVER the HEDGE is an okay effort. Rated PG and runs under 90 mins.

TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Mutant) Mutant Melee isn't nearly as complicated as the last two releases, this isn't a complaint. This game focuses on a variety of new combat moves and effects. Mutant Melee allows you to select from 20 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters (good and bad alike), with a pair of up-to-four-player modes. Players are able to play games including "King of the Hill, Last Man Standing, Knock Out" and other hidden unlockable content. Thankfully, Melee keeps Battle Nexus' multi-player improvements along with possible Turtle vs. Turtle vs Turtle vs Turtle match-ups (unlike the practice mode of the first TMNT game). It's always a good time when you can get 4 players to wail on one another without having to worry about "game plot" getting in the way of the good stuff.But if it's game plot you're after, the Adventure mode has just enough to keep it interesting, while still including some mindless action like: tossing bombs off a roof before they blow. As an older player, I found sufficient challenges to enjoy in the adventure mode, while my turtle-fan daughters ( age 7 & 4 ) overall found this one more accessible, not to mention the unique opportunity to see APRIL THROW-DOWN AND KICK SHELL! There are also cool extras. In adventure mode you earn tokens to buy (unlock) things, like settings, vehicles and comics. The latter reveals pages from the original black & white comics and the other versions of TMNT.

The Star Trek movie myth has it that only the even numbered Trek films are successful. This isn't a bad rule of thumb when dissecting the rank of these movies.The first "motion picture" is a chiefly a milestone because it is the big screen translation of a classic piece of TV and Science-fiction history (I think about the life imitating art contributions every time I flip open my cel). As a movie alone, it is awkward. Star Trek II> The Wrath of Khan, best sets the bar for what all Star Trek features aspire to be. It has it all, including Ricardo. Star Trek III, is the best of the odd #s, but it works so seamlessly with II. and IV. that it's hard to complain, the Klingons return, Spock returns, what could be better. Star Trek IV., a lighter even number, features the crew's return to save the Earth, time-traveling to the present/80's, it's kinda Star Trek's take on SAVING THE WHALES. Star Trek V. is mostly forgettable, except for a few beautiful and moving moments of brilliance, like: "the death of Bone's father, meeting God and Campfire songs w/ Kirk & Spock. Star Trek VI., subtitled "The Uncovered Apology" (just kidding) is a fine wrap-up for the original crew dispite it plot holes. Star Trek Generations, is a poor introduction to the next generation of the Enterprise, it has Kirk's "Death(s)" in it, I wish they had stopped after one. The Next Gen. Character's are very cardboard in this-one, watered down for anyone new to the TV spin-off. Star Trek:First Contact may be the best of all Ten movies, it reintroduces the Borg menace with a intense roller-coaster ride. The odd-numbered follow-up, Star Trek Insurrection, earns it's number, while the even-numbered Star Trek: Nemesis ( or X.) is a decent action-flick with a clone captain that would have be more interesting as evil twin.UNLESS YOU WANT DIRECTOR'S EDITIONS OF ALL 10 MOVIES, THIS SET IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL CREW SET, THE NEXT GEN. SET OR BUYING ONE AT A TIME. I was plenty satisfied with the quality. This is a must own set for sci-fi / Star Trek fans.This set includes the 10 Star Trek feature films in two-disc letterbox special editions. The first two movies are the newly restored director's editions with commentary director Robert Wise, special photographic effects director Douglas Trumbull, special photographic effects supervisor John Dykstra, music composer Jerry Goldsmith, and actor Stephen Collins and both with extra footage contained within the feature itself (not just tucked away on a special features disc)!. Wrath of Khan includes Commentary by director Nicholas Meyer on Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan with an Extended 116-minute director's edition of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Star Trek 3, the feature contains Commentary by director Leonard Nimoy, writer-producer Harve Bennett, director of photography Charles Correll, and actor Robin Curtis. Star Trek IV. commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. Star Trek V. contains Commentary by director/actor William Shatner and his daughter, Liz Shatner. Star Trek VI, contains commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn.Commentary provided by Brannon Braga and Ron Moore on Star Trek Generations.Commentary by director-actor Jonathan Frakes on Star Trek First Contact. Commentary by screenwriters Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore on Star Trek First Contact. Commentary by producer Rick Berman on Star Trek Nemesis. Commentary by director Stuart Baird on Star Trek Nemesis with text commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda (co-authors of The Star Trek Encyclopedia)The rest of the movies are double-disc editions loaded with extras: new and vintage interviews, documentaries, featurettes Deleted scenes and Storyboard archives.BEAM IT UP.

"UNDEAD MONKEY! Top that!"....Well, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 has a solid go at topping the top-grossing film of 2003.Johnny Depp, Oscar-nominated for the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow, possible the best-worst pirate ever owing a life debt to Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, another cursed ship. Also returning, Orlando Bloom as Wil Turner, the decent colonialist, who in the spirit of Flynn's CAPTAIN BLOOD, is drawn into the pirate's life along with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann.Wil and Elizabeth are arrested instead of wed and slated to be executed for their part in Sparrow's escape. Wil cuts a deal to bring Jack;s quirky compass in return for a pardon for he and Elizabeth. The three become involved in Sparrow's struggle to free himself of eternal servitude onboard the Flying Dutchman, along with "Bootstrap" Bill Turner aka Wil's Dad. Captain Jack and Wil Turner's unlikely friendship continues in one misadventure after another, with more returning character's from the original than you can swash a buckle with, like Elizabeth's father Governor Wetherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the lovable buffoons Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Crook), first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and the fallen Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport).Director of the original, Gore Verbinski again throws the pirates into one amusing action sequence after another, from island cannibals, to an inevitable bar fight, some Treasure Island homages, battles with barnacled minions of Davey Jones and a runaway mill-wheel-three-way duel between Jack/Wil/Norrington that is worth the price of admission and beverages.Depp's swaggering-staggering Sparrow makes any scene fascinating with his rock star take on pirates. But be WARNED: Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 were produced back-to-back to allow for quicker release of two, meaning Dead Man's Chest is "a link film." And for those of us who endured the ending wait between The Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, you know what I mean. Pirates 2, ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which is always risky. The ending leaves almost nothing resolved and no villain thwarted.The locales as breath-taking and effects are as stunning as the original, in particular the ship swallowing Kracken. Sadly the brilliant Bill Nighy as Davey Jones is wasted as the overly CGI and effect laden character, who could have been anyone and was less striking than the previous films nemesis. In fact, I would rather see Nighy play Sparrow's dad (who was supposed to be briefly in the 3 movie due out in 2007)

When you make a movie based on the Fantastic Four comic, this is what you have working against you:-The Fantastic Four is a beloved Comic Book.-The definative superhero group characters created by Stan Lee in the 60's along with his other ultra-icon Marvel heroes are introduced (later followed by the X-Men).-These characters have been archetypes in not only the comic book industry, but in comic book movies, making these heroes seem tired and cliched, before even the movie trailer begins.-Some of the these movies used Marvel concepts so close that concepts accident ran together, most recently the Incredibles: which had a team with strongman, a super-stretcher, an invisible girl with forcefields, and a baby who has flame-power along with multiple other powers. Infact, a scene was cut from the F.F. Movie, with the Thing rescuing a cat from a tree by ripping the tree from the ground and shaking it, because the Incredibles "beat them to the punch!"-No amount of "Re-inventing" without completely losing the original concept can alter the "retro-ness" even the {forgive me} cheesyness of the superhero group. So anyone making a F.F. movie, even someone who wasn't Roger Corman, would have to struggle with this. This extends to the special effects, no amount of SFX will alter the fact that a guy wrapping his body around a rock-man is not going to be real believable!On the plus side:-This F.F. filmmaker would still have Stan Lee's words, written during a time of extreme civil-strife and change, still ring true, urging us to "judge, not on appearances, but actions" I believe that that message, is still apparent in this 2005 film version.-Good casting is an factor working in this films favor, especially (Michael C.'s)the Thing, who like the comic is the most interesting, the most "human" character. This was the sledge-hammer irony Stan Lee was going for in the comic and it remains in the film. The Johnny Storm / Ben Grim dynamic is fun, if forced, this is perhaps the single across-the-board flaw of the film. Everything is a little forced, to the altering of the origin to include Dr. Doom, down to the need to untransform the Thing. I would rather have seen the Galactus/ Silver Surfer storyline intergrated into an origin story (while we're forcing things here.)Even in the world of post-Spider-Man movies, Fantastic Four is still a comic book movie, not a Graphic Novel movie or an art house film. It is a fun film, no more, no less.Mr. Fantastic's hair maybe alittle too fantastic.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY DOCTOR.....love THE MASTERHELLO DOCTOR...its your old "rival" THE MASTER am back again too, I see have regenerated again as well, into your 9th body, nice ears and I like your color choices.Enough about fashion, I see that the HUMANS you are so fond of are celebrating your 40th anniversary, of course, WE KNOW you are closer to 900, don't we DOCTOR? They have published a book cataloging ALL of the enemies you have made OVER CENTURIES of MEDDLING. They have referenced a wide variety of your enemies DALEKS, Zygons, CYBERMEN, the Yeti, THE AUTONS, the Ice Warriors, THE SEA DEVILS, Cassandra, THE SLITHEEN, and MORE of your greatest and most powerful adversaries. So, I am naturally, included, but, you'll have to wait to see my current and future incarnations. You will also have to wait to see the future looks of some of the classic villains (the new look of the Cybermen did not make it to press), some these, like myself, have yet to be re-introduced to the series (maybe in the next edition). The HUMANS have included the history (first appearance, origins, etc.), such as they understand it, along with each of the said "MONSTERS". The graphics and photos throughout the 96 page tome are state-of-the-art, for this planet and this particular era's printing.Now if you can hold out until 2065 for the 100th Anniversary Edition, is far superior. But, if you're in the 21st century and interested in learning about the galactic waiting list to make a meal of do-gooder Timelords, you might want to pick up a copy, to past the time. Farewell...Many happy returns Doctor.your enemy,THE MASTER

The Harry Potter Lego games looked good, but left much to be improved.The first Lego Star Wars (ep. I-III), was a vast improvement, great and surprisingly accurate settings from the films, lots of characters to unlock and plenty of ways to play and replay the stories using different character skills. Star Wars Lego II has all that makes the first game good, but based on the original trilogy. Improvements include more extras and ways to play characters that you've pieced together yourself.Both these games are great ways to introduce younger players to gaming and the SW Saga itself, it is easy to play and holds the interest of all ages. We had fun rewatching the movies after Lego game sessions.Keep your eyes peeled for the BATMAN Lego games.

Amazing that Keaton could pass for Batman, good production, epic Soundtrack from Prince and Elfman... before seeing this I could see any one besides Caesar Romero as the Joker, then Nicholson, the Mark Hamil from the Animated, now it's tough not to think of Heath Ledger's performance... BTW I'm watching on Netflix ... Riddle me this, why does Vale go out of her way to save a bowl of popcorn ? And why is it on her fireplace to begin with? Then she throws it in a panic anyway!

Flaming Lips is getting some overdue exposure with the use of "The W.A.N.D." in the 2007 Dell promos. If you like acid rock mixed with the Beck-like neo-folk progressive/alternative sound you'll like this one and the "Robot" album too.

A mysterious Earth-bound Timelord watches, evaluates the Doctor in a stream of seemingly unrelated adventures, the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey, the Timelords, their TARDISes, a companion all dead and gone the Doctor's memories maybe gone too. Is the Doctor responsible?It's fitting that Lance Parkin writes the last (of the continuing) adventures featuring Paul McGann's 8th incarnation of the Doctor, since Parkin wrote the first original novel featuring this Doctor in The Dying Days (The New Adventures from Virgin Publishing). It is a well-earned honor, because like his other novels ("The Infinity Doctors" is brillant!), this is another great one. The voices of the Doctor and his companions, Trix and Fitz, who are preparing to depart, are clear and consistent. This is a good novel to make way for the Eccleston 9th incarnation novels soon to the "flood" shelves. As "The Gallifrey Chronicles" represent the end of an era of sorts and the begining of a new one, a personal irony in this regard is that this novel is all that remains of my Dr. Who book collection due to Katrina. Hopefully future offerings from Mr. Parkin and BBC books will be as good as this and make rebuilding my collection worthwhile.

In this short adventure with the fifth Doctor, the Doctor and his over full TARDIS end up in the Edwardian English country-side for this almost purely historical (the first story to due so possible since the 2nd Doctor meets the Highlander, please correct me if I'm wrong on that score).The Doctor lands the TARDIS at an Edwardian train depot, where he is mysteriously expected by some local chaps for a game of cricket. Only happy to oblige, the Doctor tags along with Adric, the boy genius, Tegan, the walking mouth, and Nyssa, the smart & cute orphan from Traken. This case of mistaken identity leads the crew into a manor mystery Agatha Christie-style and a fancy-dress ball. Nyssa meets her Earth-twin and a twisted "monster" who may not have her best interests at heart.As is the way of things in the 5th Doctor's era, the incidental companions end up learning of the Doctor's true origins or of the TARDIS. This plot device has been replaced in the new series by the Doctor's psychic paper, so he doesn't have to waste precious story-time with answering questions about "how he got there."What keeps Black Orchid from being a neat historical adventure?As is the way of things in the 5th Doctor's era, the incidental companions end up learning of the Doctor's true origins or of the TARDIS. This plot device has been replaced in the new series by the Doctor's psychic paper, so he doesn't have to waste precious story-time with answering questions about "how he got there." This nearly pointless visit to the TARDIS takes away from the mystery of the period. Another mistake is the overly ambitious make-up team that in the lack of an alien, they must compensate with latex.What makes Black Orchid work? The beautiful location footage, which is always a staple of the series, the cricket game footage is really charming and are the costumes of the period and the fancy-dress as well.Some of the dialogue is clunky, but overall consistent with the theme.The story is a short 2 parter (thus the low selling price) which the new series has proved is the way of things for the 21st century viewer, so this one may be more accessible for fans who are just discovering the original shows.As far as the extras go, the cast is really down on this particular story. Their personal experiences relayed during the audio commentary are some of the most negative & abrasive you will hear tied to a DVD, but train-wreck fascinating.Possible Doctor Who drinking games.Drink when....The Doctor is completely at a loss for what is going on.Adric eats.Someone confuses Nyssa and her Earth twinThe TARDIS is gone.A mysterious onlooker looks on.

After losing my VHS original New Hope copy to KATRINA, I LIKE so many other fans feared the eternal torment of those four special edition words: Greedo Shoots First.Now you, like the fans of my generation, again have the option of watching either version.Lucas said he would never release this version again, but he needs so capital for INDY IV and SW TV. He also is aware that if he makes IT we will buy.

They say Hollywood is a "race for second place," so you might say that DISNEY'S "THE WILD" is first to be second. Talking animals from an NYC zoo, ending up in an exotic foreign place, facing their fears to become better...talking animals. If this sounds familiar you may have already seen it DREAMWORKS' MADAGASCAR released less than a year ago. I'm not pointing fingers here, Disney has been supposedly working on this for 9 years, but THE WILD comes across as a "second-hand lion," watered down and "toothless."The only differences, apart from the film and production company names, are style and voice casting. Whereas MADAGASCAR'S visual style is more cartoonish, THE WILD's approach is ultra-realistic in details. While Madagascar had characters voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer, the voice casting for THE WILD is up to Disney's high standards: Respected leader SAMSON (guess HIS species) is voiced by Kiefer Sutherland , street savy Benny the Squirrel by Jim Belushi, dim-witted Larry the Snake by Richard Kind (of "the Producers") and Janeane Garofalo as Bridget the Giraffe. Don Cherry, Canadian hockey announcer cameos as the penguin MC. One possible breakout character is Nigel the British kolala, voiced by Eddie Fizzard, trying to shed his cuddly image, later becoming idol to a pack of wildebeests along with their choreographing leader dancing to the beat of different drum, Kazar, voiced brilliantly-straight by William Shatner (who provides voice for another animated animal in the upcoming "Over the Hedge.")The WILD'S Director Steve Williams and producer Clint Goldman helped to revolutionize CG character animation during their long association with ILM ("The Mask," "Jurassic Park," "Terminator 2"), and were responsible for the popular Blockbuster commercials featuring Carl the rabbit and Ray the guinea pig. The film is scored by Academy-nominated composer Alan Silvestri ( known for the" Back to the Future Trilogy," and "Polar Express"), the soundtrack is also filled with familiar tunes by such r recording artists EVERLIFE, COLDPLAY, LIFEHOUSE, and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Other new material provided by ex-"Monty Python" member Eric Idle and fellow songwriter John Du Prez, the team responsible for the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, "SPAMALOT" writing and performing the song, "Really Nice Day" for THE WILD.As the animals embark on a dangerous journey to rescue one of their own, THE WILD, like its DREAMWORKS counterpart, is suitable for children with themes of teamwork, friendship and father-son relationships ( Samson's son's desire to get out of his father's shadow and have his own adventures). Overall it comes down to this: If you haven't seen MADAGASCAR you will enjoy this film infinitely more.

The premise of "THE INVASION OF TIME" is simple, but genius: WHAT IF... the Doctor became EVIL? "Invasion" is a sequel of sorts to the Doctor's last visit to his homeworld of Gallifrey in "Deadly Assassin" in which the Doctor saves the Timelords from the Master and in doing so becomes the sole surviving candidate in an election to determine the Timelord Presidency. The story opens with the Doctor apparently selling out his people to anonymous alien invaders. The Doctor berates and expels his companion, Leela and betrays his old Timelord mentor Borusa and before long succeeds in arranging the conquest of the planet. Once revealed, the invaders turn out to be B list, working for the Sontarans (as seen in this season's DW series 4, the "Sontaran Stratagem"). The Sontaran want control over time itself, via the relics of the President's office and the help of the Lord President of the Timelords a.k.a The Doctor...Once the Doctor's plan is revealed things really get complicated...a rebellion against the traitorous Doctor is underway, ultimately leading up to a battle for Gallifrey, even including a "unforgettable" chase through the deep recesses of the Doctor's TARDIS.Some of the best moments of the story include conversations between the overbearing Lord Doctor and Borusa, his teacher's current & most memorable incarnation played by John Arnatt. Tom Baker is in top form when he in his over-the-top megalomaniacal glory for the first half of the story. The climatic TARDIS chase is memorable, not for the execution, which isn't so good, but the sense of the transdimensional nature of the Doctor's craft. The scenes in the TARDIS really convey the limitlessness and spark the imagination for the possibilities in store for the new series, hopefully. K9 mark I. and Leela say their farewells, but what's not so memorable, the unbelievable romance between the warrior woman Leela and the sheltered Captain of the Guard, Andred. Equally forgettable are some effects on the second string invaders, the Vardans, worse than their horrible shroud images is their actual physical form in some sort of cross between a WWII paratrooper and a TV news cameraman. One major flaw of the finale of the 6 part story is having the Doctor solve the conflict with a gadget, especially when that gadget is for all intents and purposes a big gun! Even fans new to the series, know "the Doctor just `ain't down with `dat!"For all of it's script troubles, plot and FX flaws, Invasion is a must own for any Doctor Who fan, for it's many Timelord and Tardis milestones and because the Sontarans have just been revamped. Besides, this is history."Invasion" Drinking GameDrink.......everytime Gallifrey is saved from "the invaders."...when Leela kills ( or throttles ) someone....everytime RASSILON is mentioned (the Presidential induction provides loads of these.)...when you see the same BBC car-park stairwell in the TARDIS....when a Sontaran trips on patio furniture.

GRIMJACK IS BACK! .......Well, folks just call him Grimjack, his name is Gaunt, John Gaunt (no...he's no relation to the "War of the Roses" ) Gaunt, is a hard-boiled detective / former police officer, soldier and gladiator who looks like a cross between a swashbuckling pirate and a futuristic private eye with a sword. Like the great pulp detectives Gaunt's adventures take place in HIS CITY, Cynosure, a city intersecting crossroads of several universes intersect, allowing for locales that blend elements of fantasy, science fiction and the detective stories. GrimJack is a gritty anti-hero, often prone to violence The comic features some adult scenes, language and violence. Creator John Ostrander has explained,"Jack does have morality. He is not in there just to punish the bad guys. He has learned through a hard life that the only thing worth knowing is the truth, and he may kill to get to the truth." Originally the series began in 1983 as back-up stories in another comic book, "StarSlayer," published by First Comics soon getting its own comic, and was published until 13 years ago, never achieving mainstream comic appeal, but garnering a dedicated fan base First Comics folded and the rights have been in legal limbo until NOW! Not only are the trade paperbacks of the original run rapidly being published (in the LEDGEND OF GRIMJACK #1 and up...) but now with GRIMJACK: KILLER INSTINCT. Co-creator and artist TIM TRUMAN rejoins JOHN OSTRANDER for this welcome return.IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN CYNOSURE!.....

I raise the Goblet of Rock to you...a bit.I must admit to feeling some disappointment at knowledge of JOHN WILLIAMS absence as composer. But, I am glad to report, that some of Williams' style and themes are still apparent in the work of replacement composer Patrick Doyle. The Quidditch World Cup theme (track #3) is the most interesting track with its cross-culture references to both the Ireland team and the Bulgarian team. Even before seeing the movie, it is easy to connect this piece to the game and pre-game moments. This track is the most outstanding piece of music on the CD.The rest of the score is more pedestrian, than Williams would have assembled, not bad, just not exceptional.What truly breaks the HP soundtrack mold is the addition of rock to "The Goblet." Yule Ball songs are provided by the Weird Sisters care of: Jarvis Cocker of PULP and members of RadioHead. They perform "Do the Hippogriff," "This is the Night," and "Magic Works." Those songs are raw, perfect for the sort of performance you might hear at a school dance....and I mean that in a good way. Yelling at the crowd and WHATNOT. These "Ball" tracks are placed at the end of the CD following the instrumentals.I would recommend this CD to fans of the Potter movies and soundtrack collectors.

September 11th 2001, 4 planes were hijacked, 3 of them reached their targets, UNITED 93 is the story of the forth.JFK said "We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth." After 9/11, many artists chose to respond to the horror and tragedy of the events in the way they knew best - through their craft. They drew their own line offering photographs, sculpture, paintings, poetry, and film that commemorate that day. Their work, good or bad, will forever be a part of those events. So timing and quality is important. At just under 5 years since the destruction of the Twin Towers in NYC, and the crash of United 93 in a Pennsylvania field, is the time right. Maybe, it will never be right. "the Flight of United 93," although approved by the familes of the passagers, might be a story not yet ready to be told, or more accurately it might be a story not ready to be heard and seen. With public opinion of the handling of the War down, maybe the time is right for a film that depicts the courageous actions of passengers on the fourth hijacked plane.Director Paul Greengrass thoughtfully undertakes the unenviable task of telling this pivotal chapter in the events of that tragic day. Greengrass, director of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY shoots UNITED 93 almost virtually in realtime as all 40 passengers and crew gather the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 to board United's flight from Newark to San Francisco. Along with the 40, are 5 men planning to use the plane as a weapon against the U.S. Capitol. Once it "becomes clear" that a hijacking has occurred passengers begin to sneak mobile calls, saying their goodbyes, but also discovering that 2 planes have already been rammed into the World Trade Center, confirming their worst fears. The passengers see no other choice than to risk confronting the hijackers to gain control of the plane. Greengrass, along with his superb cast and crew, reconstruct the events from factual information gained from cell calls, flight recorders, the memories of families and ground controllers. Casting of mostly unknowns adds weight to the film, intensifying the haunting reality of the situation.This is no TV movie of the week. It is urgent, edgy, moving and ultimately a fitting memorial for the heroic passengers of flight United 93.Approved by the families of the passengers, a portion of proceeds goes to the FLIGHT 93 MEMORIAL FUND www.flight93memorialfund.org. The film was well received when it premiered at the Tribeca Film festival.Rated R for language and scenes of terror and violence.

Historically the regeneration episodes can be weak storied venues, only serving the introduction of a new actor to the role of the 700+ Timelord. Unfortunately, "Robot" is no different there, the story is ultimately a twist on King Kong (you'll likely see that referenced alot from the rest of the reviewers, it is pretty clear, in the final act the sympathic Robot iconically holds Sarah like Faye Wray.Baker is brillant as the 4th Doctor, from the first mutterings post regeneration to the manic technobabble, contradictory disapproval and dependence of/on the millitary. This is one of the last true UNIT stories, a safety net for whomever took over for Jon Pertwee's Earth Bound 3rd Doctor. The Brig. and crew would return as a team to face the "Terror of the Zygons" and "Android Invasion" though. He relationship with Sarah and the freshly introduced Doctor Harry Sullivan are compelling, so much so that the Sarah Jane Smith character is returning yet again in Fall '07 (following a successful solo New Year Special and her appearance on the second season of the new Dr. Who).Overall, still a pleasure to watch."Robot" Drinking Games.Drink whenever....1.)...the Doctor loses his marbles, both figuratively and literally.2.)...Dr. Sullivan puts his foot in it.3.)... woman's lib is set back decades, due to problematic screenwriting.4.)... the Doctor changes clothes or demeanor.

STEVE LYONS, author of many novels including audio dramas (THE FIRES OF VULCAN and COLDITZ) and shorts starring TV and comic book characters (Tomorrow People, Sapphire & Steel for example), is best known in Dr. Who circles for having written some excellent NEW Adventures (from Virgin publishing ) "CONUNDRUM," "WITCH HUNTERS," and "THE CROOKED WORLD."IN "THE STEALERS of DREAMS" Lyons features the 9th Doctor, as played by CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON, with ROSE and CAPTAIN JACK, as played by BILLIE PIPER and JOHN BARROWMAN. They arrive in the far future, 28th century, to find, yet again, they sometime is again holding mankind back on a world where it's a crime to lie, to tell stories, a crime even to DREAM. THE DOCTOR wants to help, until he learns how dreams can turn into nightmarish reality.As with all TV-tie-ins your going to have hits and misses, I feel that is a hit, capturing the current voice of the series using a theme classic to Dr. Who, where the line between truth and fiction blur. Another of the classic creative devices familiar to the series is having the story-action split, while one of the Doctor's companions is stalked by shadows, the other is committed to an asylum. Another "hit" is Lyons' choice of companions using Jack makes for a fun dynamic having a 51st cen. rouge for Rose and the Doctor to bounce dialog off. Lyons includes details from the 2005 season like the Slightly-Psychic Paper, and there's even a BAD WOLF ref. The only miss and my only complaint is that "STEALERS" like the rest of the BBC books, is that the works are tightly contained within the series' perimeters unlike the NEW ADVENTURES boundless scope.I would be hesitant to recommend this to those unfamiliar with the series."STEALERS" is a GOOD, FAST read, a tribute to the short time/space journey of the 9th Doctor as we welcome David Tenant and the welcome onslaught of BBC book adaptations.I hope to read more from Steve Lyons.

Jack Harkness Data Record:I'm a 51st century ex-Time-Agent and reformed after a change of plan & heart, I jumped ship literally during WWII, to join up with an unlikely pair of time travelers w/ a stranger back-story than me (and that's really sayin' somethin'). Rose is a 19 year old from the 21st century and her designated driver (whatever that means) is a 900 yr. old alien known as the Doctor. Life is never dull while you're slummin' it through time and space with these two. Unfortunately, at the moment it so happens that I'm NOT out with them. Let me tell this story from the beginning, really 28,000 years ago, ya see someone sent a caveman, yeah no kidding a really an honest to gods caveman, his name is DAS, well someone sent DAS into the future, here in the "dim-ages" where Rose is from (no offence Rose). The Doctor smelling a time-tripping rat, I.D.s the tech used as dangerous & unstable (not an unfamiliar scenario in this biz), as a result of this, the TARDIS couldn't bring DAS back to his time without killing him in the process. Oh the TARDIS, that's the Doc's time/space machine and the last of its kind, like the Doctor himself. So without so much as a drawn straw I was elected to stay behind, (or ahead if you'd rather be chronologically correct) and introduce our poor Neanderthal to the world of tomorrow, what's likely to be his new home for the rest of his natural days. I feel like the Doctor just kind of dropped the ball on this considering that, without the proper research of the time period, I'm just as much a "fish out of water" as DAS. Meanwhile the Doctor and Rose are off having all the fun by themselves, probably facing genetically engineered predators at the dawn of man. I don't mean to complain, but I did create a "big distraction" back at the hospital, when we rescued DAS, from the locals. Babysitting the "boy that time forgot" wasn't the reward I had in mind.DAZ'S JournalJack has asked me to use our computer to put down my thoughts and practice my writing. Jack tried to explain to me how the Doctor's machine allows me to understand their language and the markings that mean things; I learned that this was called reading. Since the Doctor, Rose and the TARDIS are no longer here with us I don't understand why I can still speak and read their language. Jack says that the Doctor will explain later. Jack and the Doctor are still confused about my tribe's name, I have yet to meet anyone from this Neanderthal tribe. You can't imagine all of the sights and sounds and people Jack introducing me to, while teaching me about mistaken truths on TV, I like he different TV tribes. I met a female who reminds me of the females in our tribe, Jack is also teaching me all about finding a suitable mate, he is very wise and his skills are many and numerous when it comes to this. I hop the Doctor and Rose are having equal success back in my time, it is dangerous at the best of times.Anthropologist's note (regarding the OSTERBERG experiment):From what I can deduce from, various journal entries, carbon dated artifact anomalies from 28,000 years ago, even 21st century eyewitness accounts, is that the 51st century Jack and his caveman charge were grossly underused in the events that mainly unfolded in the distant pre-history. Those mentioned in the journals: The Doctor & Rose were adequately described and used to get effect, for example Rose at one point is the bride to a pre-historic groom via the "GREAT FISH of MATROMONY" reminiscent of material by the late great Douglas Adams. As is having Rose's one big contribution to the pre-historic tribe, not fire nor weapon making, but how to manicure. At another point closer to our story's finish Rose quite literally and ludicrously goes to pieces to great, if disturbing comic effect. Thanks to the TARDIS the local languages of the Neanderthal and Human tribes are absurdly colloquial, while further research reveals many more Osterberg experiment time-travelers, a mad-scientist from the future and the Doctor learns the horrors of the Hy-Bractors that lie in wait, behind the Grey Door.Our research was successful overall, learning of the Doctor's at times preachy side, condemning humankind for the fall of the Neanderthal, as well as man's desire to solve all of life's problems with the quick fix of a pill or a button. In the end things resolve themselves, but not too neatly to be believed.

Imagine you could pick your favorite villains, from your favorite TV show, and do more than just reinvent those villains, but invent those villains, infront of the eyes of a viewer totally familiar with who those villains are, then go back and tell the story of their origin from the perspective of the protagonist. When that protagonist is a TIMELORD, it's easy to tell that story. That is just what Genesis of the Daleks is, the story of how the Doctor's greatest enemy comes to be. But, this concept is taken further than just telling their origin, the Doctor's mission is to stop that origin!This is truely one of the best story arcs of the 4th incarnation of the Doctor, as played by fan-favorite, Tom Baker (currently narrator on the successful "Little Brittain" series).This gritty and sometimes extremely dark story is one I and many fans have been waiting on for DVD release. The Doctor questions his own morality, wrestling with the decision to wipe out the Daleks like some terrible disease: To destroy an intelligent life form, wiping out a race, would 'he' be any better than the Daleks.One short-coming is the price of BBC 2-disc sets is high and the special-bonus material is usually less-than special.

"One good solid hope's worth a cart-load of certainties..." well, any fan worth their salt will certainly want this set...The on-again-off-again blocks of tight continuity and multi-episode story arcs of the new Doctor Who series has already primed fans for the return of this string of CLASSIC Doctor Who stories and some of the best of Tom Baker's final season as the 4th incarnation of the Timelord. This set comes not only at a peak of the show's popularity, but during the restyling of the shows look (and sound). Producer John-Nathan Turner, retooled, the theme and graphic for the 80's, even the Doctor's threads, JNT introduced his appropriately somber plum gear. This set contains the finest examples of all of those changes, end for the Timelady Romana and K9, also the beginning of the end for the 4th Doctor."Full Circle" is the first of this arc featuring not only an introduction E-Space, a smaller universe with a universe, but the Doctor's questionable next companion, Adric. Adric is a sortof smarter-version of the 2nd Doctor's Highlander companion Jamie, crossed with Dickens' "Artful Dodger." Will Sci-fi writers never learn, the arrogant oversmart teenager is never appealing on screen, just as poor ole' Weasley Crusher. "Full Circle" for it's faults contains some great moments for Baker to chew-up the scenery, and some superb costuming, the Marshmen ala' creatures of the Black Lagoon. "Full Circle" is a tale of a culture apparently stuck in endless preparations for a "return home" with several dark secrets which further delay their journey. Determined to get "back to the basics" and have the Doctor solving problems without any quick fixes, the producers planned to remove K9 from the series. Already, opening the season with him exploding in saltwater, the assault on K9 continues having him spend much of this 4 parter with his head off.The next story "State of Decay" is the best of the three...finally VAMPIRES in the Doctor Who Universe (or in this case an E-Space universe)...The Doctor tells in hoarse whispers how "every known planet has legends of vampires" and reads ancient tales of the early Timelords and the war with the Great Vampire and his minions, he reveals how after the bodies were tallied, he remained unaccounted for. Before Steven Moffat's episodes aired, State of Decay was surely the creepiest of the long running series. An ancient rocket, it's fuel tanks filled, not with fuel, but BLOOD!! Hoo, hoo! Genius! An the superb attention to atmosphere in "the village," even Romana's wardrobe to the Hammeresques trio of kingly vampires...Genius, I say again.Finally, the escape from E-Space in "Warrior's Gate." Featuring a strange and interesting use of a virtual environment, while fairly common now was less successful in past attempts when the series worked "set-less." Here I feel it works well achieving the "nowhere" effects (much like the 2nd Doctor's visit to the Land of Fiction), although much of this episode is overcomplicated and artsy. The cat-people make-up, of the Thrails and the neat Gundan robot warriors all add the high-concept effort of this unique story. In some early moments two of the crew of the Slaver ship indulge an homage to "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" even including the coin. The story follows a cat-like race that while once cruel masters themselves, are currently in need of liberating, the Doctor's prime hobby. As always more great dialog, gems like the Doctor's, "We'll burn that bridge when we come to it." and from Romana, "Astral Jung!" The final farewell to Romana and K9 is brief and less moving than many departures in the show's history, although the Doctor assures us that she will be more than just alright...she'll be SUPERB.The E-Space Trilogy is a really good set of DVDs to own at a pretty good price.E-SPACE DRINKING GAMES...Drink whenever:...the TARDIS Monitor shows an exterior shot of someplace they're not....you see a technacothaka or any other quirky turn of phrase like the "Three Who Rule," "the Wasting" or even "Mistfall."...K9 is broken, abused or otherwise written out of the story....the Doctor misquotes Shakesphere...like 'He who outlives this day and comes safe home shall stand a tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of E-Space!"...the Doctor says, "SWARMED" ...what? "Swarmed."...Adric seemingly or actually betrays Romana to gangs or vampires....a character melodramatically utters the title, example. "...we've come Full Circle!"...we see an establishing shot that is a model or a matte...like the STARLINER, The Tower, the Warriors Gate or the long shots of the SlaveShip....the Doctor shows off his (architectural) expertise and misses the mark like in the Tower of the Lords in "State of Decay" he says the decor is rococo when actually it's late Saxon/early Romanesque...oh snap!

We bought this with to intentions:1.) To allow our Kindergartner to go out biking with my wife and me on paths and the like2.) To build the confidence of our older child who was struggling with learning to bike.The Trailer worked perfectly for both of these purposes. In fact after ONE ride on the trailer my oldest child gain enough confidence in her balance to hop on her bike solo and she has been riding well ever since. This alone was worth the investment for us!Technically the only problem was the harness occassionally twists my seat slightly to the side, this was solved by extra tightening before each ride. The assembly was easy by biking standards and the trailer is very sturdy too.

The short-lived live action series captures the spirit of the comic and cartoon Tick series. In this incarnation, still written by creator Ben E. has more adult material than its brothers. Old fans may miss the infamous battle cry of "Spoon!" the casting couldn't be more perfect. And many of the character reinventions and subtile changes really work better than the originals, Bat-manuel and Capt. Liberty. The only let down is the lack of extras. There are too few creator commentaries. Overall an cool 2 disc complete collection.

I am of two schools of thought on this series... 1) Bones is a not so undercover Vulcan denying her emotions while exploring the human condition, 2.) She is a Replicant and as an android, only thinks she is denying those emotions ... Which ever you embrace determines your take on Booth's intent to either turn the Vulcan Doctor into a vampire or retire the Skin-job... Because sometimes Blade Runners retire Vulcans by mistake.. And tryin' to turn an android into a vamp would just be silly.Seriously it's an awesome and quirky take on the whole morgue genre.

We were looking for a substitute of the likes of the Video Now or some the other mindless electronic toys on the X-Mas must-have lists. It isn't much cheaper than those others, but we felt that the options for creativity were greater with the PIXTER.Like the other systems there are built-in functions: a tetris-like game, a drawing page, word games, dot-to-dot pages, and more. The stylus tool is fairly easy to use and the drawing functions have many stamps, backgrounds and other methods to enhance artwork. The PIXTER will save selected works, also there are many accessories to extend PIXTER interest, additional cartridges some with licensed products like Sponge-Bob, Barbie, Walking with Dinosaurs, Teen Titans, each allowing real-time clips and editing of TV scenes ($20 each). One of the most interesting accessories is the digital camera for even more personalized creative play.My 8 and 5 year old were hooked by the PIXTER. The only problem is the batteries, some systems come with chargers or AC ports, the PIXTER DOES NOT. We bought rechargable AAs for the toy.Also many stores do not carry assessories for the system, but TOYS R US has the digital camera for the set (@$[...]) which is really great, allowing users to modify & play with photos of their own!

It ain't instant tan dude! R.L.'s twist on I was a teenage ... something HAIRY anyway... my favorite ending I think of the GB books. These 80's classic kid tributes to the horror pulp genre never get old... the twist endings, 1st person protagonist have roots as far back as H.P.Lovecraft & E.C. Comics Vault / Crypt titles. The series numbering is now gone but the classics continue to live on (or unlive as the case may be).

The trade-paperback of the original GRIMJACK comic series. This volume reprints issues fifteen through twenty-one, published in the mid-80's, this is when the book really finds it's voice and takes off. Grimjack is the original "hard-boiled Barbarian"in the deadly PAN-DIMENSIONAL city of CYNOSURE, where reality is changed like underwear, where guns work someplace, magic other places, but swords work everywhere!In this volume Co-creator TIM TRUMAN leaves the series (only to return better-than-ever in 2005's KILLER INSTINCT, see my review)so we have stunning art by TOM SUTTON and inks, finishes by STEVE ERWIN who also does art in MUNDEN'S BAR segments which are finally included in vol.4. Traditionly the Munden's backstories were light filler/shorts, but here they are included because they are important to filling TRADE WAR plot gaps."THIS WHEELS on FIRE" starts the TRADE WARS storyline rolling with the return of PROF. ALTHEA MUELLER who had hermind re-intergratedwith her new body in GRIMJACK 9 (or Legend of GJ vol. 3). This is followed by WOLFPAC which delves deeper into JOHN GAUNT'S history in the ARENA, as agladiator known as THE DANCER plots and his return. GAUNT and BLACKJAC go to free the child-gladiators and end up in arena facing the children themselves. Then the Dancer's plans come to fruitation using Gaunt to set events in motion than begin the TRADE WARS. The Alpha Centauri Commercial Empire had taken over Cynosures ruling body, putting them in a position to force their competitors out of the city, once it is revealed to the other congomerates, the corporate war erupts in a very real sense. GRIMJACK and his partners are in the middle of it, all the while Dancer and his servants wait to kill Gaunt when the timeis right.This collection contains some of the best storytelling yet in the series. All of the characters that make Grimjack such an interest series, are at their best:NOLESKi, the hick biker-cop, ROSCOE, gaunt's ex-partner, SPOOK, the lady as beautiful as she is dangerous, BLACKJAC, who fought w/ Gaunt in the ARENA, and more. We learn how Gaunt gets his scar in this collection and in the last and best story reprinted we see a badly wounded Grimjack, an easy target for his enemies and any other killer wantin' to make a rep. Sutton's new look for the series sets an amazing new direction for the series unbound by convensional comic style.I can't wait for tne next set of reprints in volume 5, Gaunt's Death and more.

Condensing 5 books into one film can hurt storylines and make for lots of undeveloped characters. But the archetypes in Spiderwick are so familiar (like the abbreviated Potter movies) that it is less of a disadvantage than you would think. We, as objective movie viewers have to let go of the expectation for the Holy Grail of the perfect book-to-film translation and face that the mediums are apples and oranges. This is an easy task for me this time because I haven't read any of the Spiderwick series. But having said that, my children and I, enjoy the film. The look of the "world" created in the spirit of the books were originally stylized enough to make it a departure from the world of Hogwarts (which is no small accomplishment when you also have trolls and griffins.Typical of the archetypes of the genre, you have the child-outsider of a broken (or bent) home who blunders into a magic world, along with quirky, sometimes ill-mannered, but ultimately well-meaning siblings and finally the single parent who doesn't believe a word-of it. The kid opens a book he shouldn't (like who would read a book that has "Do not open" on the cover, it should have read: don't open infested with Lice!" that would have kept `em out!) and then spends the film trying to make things right and bonding with his estranged family.Production is pretty eye-candy using visual designers of the Henson school of creature making. John Horner (the not-Williams) composes a face paced soundtrack that matches the speed of the story and slows appropriately of the sappier moments of the movie. The cast is a watchable bunch of not-overly attractive kids, along with some voice cameos like Martin Short and Nick Nolte, not without distinction, plays the badie (physically sometimes) well enough.We enjoyed the film and, if there isn't higher praise than this let me know, we were inspired to check-out the Spiderwick Chronicles book series at our local library to fill in all the plot holes.

They could have goofed on the 80's cop show like Bacardi's TV spoofs and all of the "updated" big screen translations, most recently: Bewitched, Starsky and Hutch, the DUKES of HAZZARD.But Director Michael Mann still has a vision for Miami Vice and it's South Floridian cops. He wanted to make the film what the show was at the time, edgy and pretty, because Mann know composition. The imagery in the original was so interesting to look at that it generated a pop-culture icon that seriously (and embarrassingly) influenced fashion. Although now the pastels and linens are gone, the high-def photography,intense edits and high action kick VICE up to Mann's usual high standards. Like Collateral he delivers in a modern setting in colors as dark and gray as Crokett and Tubbs very souls. Colin Farrell's Crockett is okay, minus some corny lines, and Foxx's role as sidekick, makes him seem underused.The story is tricky, but merely the means to the music video ends, which is a Mann film: The pair infiltrate a cartel to scope-out a dept. leak. There's lots of drugs, some women and incidental music (no Jan Hammer though).Mann struggled with whether or not to use "In the Air Tonight" for one pivotal pre-battle scene (you'll have to go for yourself to see if he did.It's about what you'd expect , no more, no less...By the by, the shoot was so intense Farrell checked into rehab immediately after.

Was the Wolf framed? Is there more to Red-Riding Hood than her keen deductive ability and her hood? "HOODWINKED" asks these questions in a film more family friendly than SHREK. Sure, comparison to the SHREK films in unavoidable when twisting fairy tales. But Hoodwinked has it's own style, although it is a less slick style than Pixar or Dreamworks. Just with more quirky songs and more awkward charm.HOODWINKED,is a FRACTURED FAIRY TALE in the spirit of Jon Scieszka's The True Story of the Three Little Pigs. The movieopens like a traditional telling of Red-Riding Hood,with "Red" voiced by Anne Hathaway taking goodies to Granny, voiced by Glenn Close, she finds the wolf, a woodsman (Jim Belushi) leaps in with an ax.....then the police arrive. The best Of these retellings are by the Wolf, voiced by Patrick Warburton, and Granny. The Wolf reveals that he is an undercover reporter who not only dresses like Chevy Chase's Fletch, but he shares Fletch's disguise kit and soundtrack. Warburton plays the Wolf perfectly in every scene. Granny's retaling parodies "XXX" in her taste for extreme sports is revealed. Other notable voices and cameos by Andy Dick, David Ogden Stiers and Xzbit.The film is loaded with great one-liners, pop references and gags that will appeal to all-ages.

Like the first book, The Outlaw Varjak Paw the sequel is full of intriguing characters, mythological archetypes and reads like an AFRICAN folktale (written for 4-5th graders). The world Said has created with his warrior cats is both realistic and fantastic, like animal tales before, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NiMH, or the REDWALL series, but this one has martial arts.Varjak Paw is a Mesopotamian Blue kitten,who had lived a sheltered like up in a oldhouse, until he learns about the WAY- a secret martial art for cats.Having saved the city cats from a fate worse than death, our young protagonist finds himself the leader of a new gang. But will the pressure take its toll on this brave but sometimes naive cat? Soon the city erupts in a gang war as the evil Sally Bones attempts to control all cats. Hopelessly outnumbered, Varjak and the others must fight for their freedom or die trying. SF Said's second work, effectively taut, moves an increasingly grim plot, and makes Varjak's growing maturity and leadership appear natural. Outlaw is a sequel that so surpasses the original with its fast pacing and vivid battle scenes that make it a fast read. Also Dave McKean's striking sketchy iillustrations add much to the haunting mood of the series.

The horror ensues as a group of New Orleans teenagers begin an ON-LINE ROLE PLAYING game in which they fill-out FEMA applications and deal with insurance and mortgage companies while they try to get through nightmarish bureaucracy to rebuild after KATRINA.... Then they discover the game and the nightmare is REAL!!!!!!!Just kidding...A group of New Orleans teenagers begin to play an ultra-realistic next level videogame called, you guessed it...STAY ALIVE, based on the spine-chilling true story of a 17th century noblewoman known as "The Blood Countess." they soon discover a spine-chilling connection -- they are each being brutally murdered one-by-one in the same method as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and the real world disappears, the group must find a way to STAY ALIVE. The film boasts Frankie Muniz, Malcom himself ( as SWINK), Jon Foster (as HUTCH) Samaire Armstrong, Sophia Bush (as ABIGAIL and October), Jimmi Simpson (as PHINEUS), Adam Goldberg (as MILLER). Rated PG-13 - for horror violence, disturbing images, language, brief sexual and drug content typical of Hollywood teen horror fare. This film runs 85 minutes long, and this is long enough. "Stay Alive" goes the way of most (21st cen.) films of the genre, since Wes Craven (director of Freddy's Elm St. series) redefined it with self-satire in Scream, which is the build on the slasher-movie mythos by using concepts so familiar to us that the tension stems from our own anticipation and the predictability of the film itself. Stay Alive director William Brent Bell, knows the genre well-enough having worked as production coordinator and assistant director on TV projects ( BUCKETS OF BLOOD and ALIENS FOR BREAKFAST in the 90's) for ROGER CORMAN, the king of the B-Horror flick. This can be okay, as long as you know that is what you are paying for, don't expect a movie milestone here, okay.The ultimate horror will come when the sequel STAYIN' ALIVE comes in which the survivors play an in an ultra-realistic John Travolta dancing film!!!!Just kidding...BIG EASY ALERT! BIG EASY ALERT! BIG EASY ALERT!"Stay Alive" has a DETECTIVE THIBODEAUX played by Wendell Pierce.

Writer/director Paul Weitz (AMERICAN PIE , ABOUT a BOY) hits us with his new film American Dreamz satirizes the White House incompetence, the flaws in the "war on terror" and the idiocy of TV's "American Idol." Weitz uses these easy targets for send-ups, while (again) attempting to make us like stupid and unlikable characters. While this worked in ABOUT a BOY and his AMERICAN PIE series of films, it is awkward at best, and he has greatest success with his show tune loving-would-be-terrorist, OMER. Let me explain......the story begins when President Staton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up one morning and decides, for the first time, to read the newspaper. He awakens to the possibilities of an outside world. Meanwhile, the self-absorbed host of TV's talent contest "American Dreamz," Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), about to start another season, he demands to have an Arab represented on the show. His call is answered by, Omer (Sam Golzari), a less than enthusiastic terrorist "sleeper" dumped for incompetence and sent to the U.S. to live with family waiting for his orders. The future "American Dreamz" winner, Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), callously prepares for her future in showbiz by keeping her dim ex-boyfriend (Chris Klein) only to win votes. Willem Dafoe as a Cheney-looking Vice President, works to get the President, & the States, back under control, give Staton "happy pills" and making him wear an earpiece when speaking in public. As part of a PR blitz the President will make a guest appearance on "American Dreamz" in a painfully contrived connecting of characters. Weitz spends much of the movie attempting to humanizing these quirky stereotypes, the President starts to look like a nice, but spaced-out guy, along with the First-lady (Marcia Gay Harden), while even the shallow Sally and cynical Martin are revealed to be lonely behind their Hollywood facades.In the end the movie falls short, after all the character tinkering Weitz fails to make a cohesive story. He supplies lots of interesting performances and interesting characters like: Tony Yalda as Iqbal, the flamboyantly gay cousin who helps with Omer's TV image; Jennifer Coolidge as Sally Mom, Chris Klein as Sally's boyfriend, Dafoe's VP has some great scene with the Staton as does Sam Golzari as the "Omerizing" contestant who may or may not win or blow-up the Prez. The movie's strength lies in the bashing of iconic sterotypes, from TV and from the general public, more concerned with reality TV voting than voting in a presidential election, in fact it is the movie's tagline. Another strength of the film is the energy used pointing out items made off limits for questioning or discussion, no matter how obvious, like the President blurting out that the War was a bad idea. But I expected more from this one, given the talent behind the project.

What a fanboy dream! Shakespearian Actor/director Kenneth Branagh directing the epic tale of the God of Thunder.The film tells the story of Thor's exile to Earth or Midguard. To learn how to rule the All Father Odin issues this punishment with the ultimate goal for Thor to lose his hubris and gain so insight before returning to Asgard, but there's more at steak than he or Thor realize. Needless to say the effects, costumes and art direction are all you expect from Marvel.Chris Hensworth...Dug him as brief appearance as kirk's dad, but he was flipping awesome as Thor! The lovable arrogance, Nordic look and the scary body sculpting made him seem born to play the part... Can't wait to see The character return for Avengers (May 4th, 2012)And Sir Tony is all ways great I remember being druggies by one of his break out roles in Magic, he even made Wolfman palatable but he was a natural as Odin in Thor!He deserved to be in the halls of Asgard as do Thor's cohorts.Great as Loki in Thor! Added more that just the slickness you need for The Trickster god, but made him a sympathetic character too. Interesting looking guy...Portman is likable as a mortal scientist ( of course ) who aids and reacts appropriately to the shirtless Thor after hitting him with the car, twice. Kat dennings was fun as Portman's sidekick grad assistant. As is Stellan Skarsgard as Prof Selvig (who we shall see next year in the Avengers too).Watch for comic cameos by Avengers' Hawkeye to Black Panther... And don't forget for you leave early you'll be FURY-ious.Next stop Captain America...

It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!Robert Downey Jr. was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a.K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile, the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything from the dancing EXPO girls...the Iron Man-ites, to the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies). Watch for an homage or two to other AVENGERS characters as the Marvel movies move grow ever nearer to those future releases.... Next stop Thor:The Movie....Again, War Machine vs. Iron Man in the same film is worth admission.... War Machine teamed with Iron Man for show down, bonusstayed after the credits...I advise you to stay....upshot on the film....it rocked don't let some Chicago Tribune reviewer tell ya different, (Tribune gave an uncalled for 2 1/2 ) like the first film, fanboyness aside, it was GOOD!

Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). During March and through June the BBC celebrated by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This hardback book contains all 13 season one scripts for the 2005 rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. Seven of these scripts are by Russell T. Davies, with the remaining 6 by Steven Moffat, Robert Shearman, Paul Cornell and Mark Gatiss. Each provides an insightful intro for their scripts revealing their inspirations and changes they had to make to bringing the stories to screen. These writers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon, which evident in Davies' final remarks:"There are some people in the TV industry who have asked archly, why I'm now writing genre, instead of drama. Obviously, they've never watch a single episode of Doctor Who. It's the best drama in the world."Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston, infusing the character with great humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some ending with cliffhangers, some without. It contains explanatory notes on the scriptwriting process, giving a unique insight into how the writers visualized their stories and OVER a THOUSAND PHOTOS from the 2005 season. This book has an attractive cover and interior graphics are nice. But MORE importantly the collection gives fans an insider's look at how the show works. But.

A message from the CYBER-LEADER of the CYBER FLEETATTENTION: HUMANSThe "Time War" left the DALEKS and the TIMELORDS de-stroyed. Only the TIMELORD known as THE DOCTOR is still at large in time and space. His foes are so numerous and varied, that their existence is known even to the backwards inhabitants of the Earth. In fact, after so many foiled invasion attempts by that interfering "Defender of Mankind" that they are now aware of even OUR great Cyber-race. This knowledge is revealed in the second fully illustrated "ALIENS and ENEMIES" what the Humans refer to as "a book" is a guide to past, present and future menaces. Continuing where the previous text left off (DR.WHO: MONSTERS & VILLAINS,see the message from the MASTER in my reviews) included this time are races like the SYCORAX, who were thwarted on "Christmas" by the newly regenerated 10th incarnation of THE DOCTOR, also THE REAPERS, scavengers of time itself, the GELTH, the ZARBI, and more. Also including ancient (and classic) beings such as the Celestrial Toymaker, and SUTEKH, so powerful that the foolish Humans believed him the god of darkness itself.More galactic secrets are revealed, facts, figures and images of each creature feature alongside a synopsis of their sightings (episodes they appeared in, plus, behind-the-scenes information). Revealing insights into how each were created and brought to life, including each our glorious origins, OUR new designs ('06) and our weakness to a certain element which shall not be repeated here!This admittedly within these "pages" are contained much information that will prove to be very useful and give these EARTHLINGS an unfortunate weapon in defending against future (and past) insurgences, but the great Cyber-race...SHALL NOT BE STOPPED.RESISTANCE is USELESS HUMANS.end of transmission...CYBER-LEADER out.

At the time this mini-reunion episode was conceived, the series was plagued with production / union issues, Colin Baker was given the short end of the stick so much so that come regeneration time he wouldn't even return for the transitional shots. Today, unhampered by these problems, Baker's 6th Doctor portrayal is much improved in the audio format currently being done by BIG FINISH PRODUCTIONS (some concepts of which have been borrowed by the new series compare 2005's "Dalek" TV adventure with Colin Baker's "Jubilee" audio adventure).I remember the bittersweet rumors that the production for this one was to be set in NEW ORLEANS, but due to budget constraints the episode was ultimately shot on location in Spain. Oh, how cool would that have been to see the Two Doctors bounding from restaurant to restaurant in the FRENCH QUARTER!! As it stands Spain has a similar architecture and array of eateries, enough to serve the plot, such as it is. The second Doctor and Jamie (the namesake of the alias the Doctor uses in Tooth and Nail of '06)are investigating "unauthorized" time experiments the Timelord deem dangerous, which in itself is confusing since at this point the Doctor is still on the run from his people (who ultimately catch and punish him in the 2nd Doctors final adventure War Games). Things go wrong and the 2nd Doctor may very well die there, if not for the temporal nature of the experiments taking place Doctors 3-6 might very well have ceased to exist.The 6th Doctor and Peri find an abandoned Jamie who has seen this future, unless the Doctor's future self becomes involved.Colin Baker (6th Dr.) and Patrick Troughton (2nd Dr.), have a great chemistry on screen, as the pair were family friends (Baker was college roommates with Troughton's son), although at times the arguments and jibes seem forced to mirror the abuse between Doctors in the original reunion show THE THREE DOCTORS and THE FIVE DOCTORS.Some of the Doctor's tactics, let alone the overall whimsically cruel and dark mood of the latter part of the story, are disturbing. For example, the fight between the "Gum" and a limping flesh-wounded Doctor, to find the conveniently abandoned butterfly Cyanide as a weapon. Although the Doctor has on occasion wiped out armies of aliens (not to mention his own race in the current series) none seem as uncomfortable as this struggle for his own survival here.Definitely a 6th Doctor story worth owned, if only for the history of the concept and the lovely Spanish locations, not to mention the return of the Sontarians and some great lines, like, "Small mammals can be quite flavorsome..."Drinking Games for "the Two Doctors"Drink whenever......anyone eats (there's quite alot of this)...anyone chases a cat (well, anything really)...anyone claims to be the Doctor...anyone dies or is mortally wounded (there's quite alot of this, too)

The Turtles triumphant return to the big screen. This time round its computer generated, which adds substantially to the emotional range of the characters. The art directors hedged their bets by stylizing the human designs rather than the risky attempt to do any ultra-realistic representation. But, the turtles are animated to gorgeous mutant perfection, as you'd expect. This allows for the terrific dynamic between the brothers, especially the expressiveness necessary to convey some of the more charged moments between Leonardo, just returned from South American soul-searching and brother Raphael chafing at the need to follow any orders. The siblings deal with these issues in a way that none of the other incarnations of character have taken on, the series has grown up with it's audience, those of us who were fans of the original books, movies and TV shows. It will still appeal to its new generation of Turtle fans, but it is surely the most clever and best written of any non-comic version. While the film still combines elements of the currently running comic book series with the original film series and the currently running Saturday morning fare. Don't worry, it combines the best elements...really. Throw-backs include some sewer skatin', Splinter joinin' the fray and a "I love bein' a turtle" closer. Not to mention a timely soundtrack, like a particularly effective use of a cover of "Black Betty" during Raphael's scuffle with the Jersey Devil appropriately enough in Kevin Smith's kitchen.The voice talent is particularly notable in TMNT: Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar is an excellent April, Patrick Stewart is a perfect mult-millenium-aged warrior-king, the venerable Mako (Aku of SAMURAI JACK & that wizard in CONAN) is a natural for Master Splinter, cameos from Kevin Smith a.k.a Silent Bob (as a cook), Laurence Fishburne of the Matrix narrates, also, Ziyi Zhang, Chris Evans (as Casey Jones) and others.The story is pretty good, if maybe complex: The Turtles have gone their separate ways, Leo off to become a better leader, Raphael embarks on a solo vigilante career in the absence of a team, Mikey does kid's parties as a Turtle-headed Cowabunga Carl, while Donny, of course, is a phone-bound tech-support. No back-story or origin of the turtles is needed nor is it supplied, we are thrown right in with a Lord of the Rings style set-up of a warrior who opens a gateway to immortality, but in doing so, releases 13 monsters upon the world and when our story begins in the present, 3000 years later, the time has come to make things right, with the help of the recently reunited Turtles, the FOOT Clan (lead by Korai, the Shredder's adopted daughter and sole heir, although this isn't referenced in the film) and some living stone warriors from the old days. The team ultimately work out their interpersonal issues and team-up for the epic climax including Casey & April.Great, gorgeous and clever " I do hope there's more of them..."

The Adventures of Brisco County was one of the most creative productions on television. Each week, Brisco and his friends, the Mae West-like old flame Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford), lawyer/ administrator Socrates Pool, the loyal and mad Prof. Wickwire (the brillant John "Gomez" Astin) and others take on the villains the "Old West" while keeping an eye on the future. The Harvard-educated bounty hunter teams up with his rival Lord Bowler (Julius Carry, Sho `Nuff for THE LAST DRAGON) to capture the Bly gang responsible for his father's death and much more. It is this clever combination of classic action, a touch of sci-fi, and a good dose of humor that make the series unique (example: bad guys who paint tunnels on rocks like a train-robbing coyote). So, take a minute or two and slip back into the wild & weird days of the old west - where riding, shooting, and fighting was the measure of a man - that and a square jaw, a talking wonder horse and outlaws from the future. The series was also loaded the Bruce Campbell's quirky humor and full of great anachronistic goofs on "coming things" loads of modern ideas and concepts quickly dismissed by the cast as impossibly unrealistic for the future (like Drive Thru-dining or hamburgers a.k.a "Cowpies") The series was groundbreaking in a relatively unique TV genre, the "Western-Indiana Jones-style-action-sci-fi-spoof" (there was "Best of the West" an 80's sit-com western and "The Wild, Wild West").Here's the complete series episode breakdown, with some highlights:1.)The PILOTWhen U.S. Marshal Brisco County, Sr. is murdered by John Bly and his gang, the robber barons of San Francisco's Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. as a bounty hunter to round them up. Brisco meets a line-up unusual people along the way, including rival bounty hunter Lord Bowler, and the Westerfield Club's stuffy lawyer, Socrates Poole also Prof. Wickwire. He also learns of a mysterious ORB which John Bly (Billy Drago, reoccurring on Charmed) would do anything to possess, for the supernatural power it can give him.2.) The ORB SCHOLAROn X-Files, whic happen to run after Brisco, they had Mythos episodes that continue the continuity of the alien-cover-up storyline. In Brisco, episodes would spring up exploring the mystery of the ORB so desired by the murderer of Brisco County Sr. Here we learn more about the ORB, and of Brisco's destiny with it. Very good for such an early episode.3.) NO MAN'S LANDThis one has little ORB continuity, but it does have a town propulated only by women, the Schwenke Sisters, and Professor Wickwire.4.) BRISCO in JaliscoBrisco and Socrates head to Mexico to recover some stolen guns. Brisco is in for a shock when Pete Hutter turns up as the thief, trying to sell them to a crooked General.5.) SOCRATES' SISTER`Nuff said. Prof. Wickwire invents his Amazing Innerspace Suit (a diver's suit) too.6.) RIVERBOATYep, you guessed it a gambling sting on riverboat. The invention of jeans, too.7.) PIRATES!Brisco & Bowler try to capture crazy land-pirate Blackbeard LaCutte, a wanted member of the Bly gang, who has stolen all of a town's supplies, including the medicine needed to save a sick boy (awe-say it ain't so).8.) SENIOR SPIRITMore Prof. Wickwire and the ghost of Brisco County Sr.9.) BRISCO FOR THE DEFENSEBrisco uses those lawyering skills we've heard so little about, to defend an old collage buddy.10.)ShowdownBrisco & Bowler head to Brisco's hometown, to help an old girlfriend and her sheriff father stop a town takeover.11.) DEEP in the HEART of DIXIEDixie and Brisco are on the run from a hitman and his gang. The superb David Warner makes a guest appearance.12.) CRYSTAL HAWKSEvery bounty hunter in the West is out for Brisco for a crime he didn't commit, lead by lady bounty hunter Crystal Hawks played by Sheena Easton. Bly is in this one too.13.) STEEL HORSESBrisco & Bowler try to capture Bly gang member Juno Dawkins, and recover the prototype motorcycles he's stolen to use to intercept a government wagon transporting the mysterious ORB.14.) MAIL ORDER BRIDESThe disturbing Swill Bros. have stolen the dowry of 3 mail order brides.15.) A.K.A. KansasBrisco uses the alias of Kansas Wily Stafford, to infiltrate the ranks of an ex-Bly gang member and ex-husband of Dixie, with Dixie's help, ofcourse.16.) BOUNTY HUNTER's CONVENTIONThis is a take off of Agatha Christie's THE TEN LITTLE INDIANS. Its a mystery who-done-it in the classic sense, complete with an old hotel, thunderstorms, and secret passages.17.) FOUNTAIN OF YOUTHBrisco vs. the Best-looking gang he's ever seen, while we learn Bly's true origin and purpose.18.) HARD ROCKA great episode! We get to meet Sheriff Aaron Viva (one of the best characters in the series), an Elvis knock off (get it Aaron Viva) that can eat as well as he can "use his stuff" in hand to hand action, this is one of hundreds of pop culture and rock references. Whip Morgan also shows up for the first time.19.) The Brooklyn DODGERSBrisco and Bowler help kids get to San Francisco and fight off the Johnnies.20.) BYE BLYA woman from the future helps Brisco in his final confrontation with Bly and the origin of the ORBs. Sets of the future of the series giving Brisco and Bowler a mission from the President himself.21.) NED ZEDA run of the mill story is taking to another level by presenting the episode as a father and son reading a dime novel about Brisco and Bowler! Super! It's also got the old lumberyard gag and the machine gun.22.) STAGECOACHBrisco transports a lady spy to Mexico by stagecoach for a prisoner exchange, unaware that an assassin is already among them.23.) WILD CARDBrisco , Bowler and Whip Morgan try to help Dixie and her sister Dolly get back a casino which was swindled away from Dolly by a hood's son.24.) AND BABY MAKES 3Brisco, Bowler, Whip and Dixie protect the infant future Emperor of China, while foiling Peter Hutter's "diabolical" plans along with the idea for "Air Screw" from Da Vinci.25.) BAD LUCK BETTY The introduction of another fun character Betty O' Donnell, while Brisco, Bowler and Whip investigate spooky goings-on. Meanwhile, the "rain bath" is invented just in time to spoof Psycho in a very familiar boarding houseFinal 2 parter HIGH TREASONAfter Brisco and Bowler are asked by the army to put together a team (including the Professor, Whip, Pete and Aaron Viva) to rescue a kidnapped young woman, they find that the situation is not as they were told, and soon find themselves accused of high treason. A crooked Colonel and General do their best to see that Brisco and Bowler are found guilty and executed and that's just the middle!! The second part features Terry Bradshaw leading an army of bounty hunters after Brisco and Bowler. These bounty hunters are played by real Cowboys, the NFL kind. Prof. Wickwire invents a Zeppelin airship, leading to lots more rock references.

Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). The BBC celebrated in 2005 by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodes from the rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any "new" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.The PILOT story: "ROSE" introduces his new companion Rose Tyler who is attacked by mannequins (or AUTONS) in the department store where she works. She meets the Doctor and the pair end up fighting to save the world. The pacing of this one, like most of the 13 new episodes, is like lightning, and the Autons have never been scarier. The TARDIS (interior) has never looked better or bigger.Next in "THE END of the WORLD" The Doctor offers Rose a chance to go anyplace, anytime, they end up 5 Billion years in the future above the Earth just before it ends. But someone has sabotaged the very observation satellite they're on. Not a bad episode, it shoots very high with a "Restaurant at the End of the Universe" motif and cinematically accomplishes it, also reveals that the Doctor is the "Last of the Timelords."In the 3rd story the Doctor and Rose meet Charles Dickens and what appears to be ghosts animating the dead! 4 Weddings and a Funeral's Simon Calow plays the Victorian author brilliantly and the Victorian look of the episode is well executed.The 2005 series won the 2006 BROADCAST AWARD for BEST DRAMA SERIES adding to the series' successes at the National Television Awards (voted Most Popular Drama), TV Moments, and the BBC 2005 Drama Awards! The show's two stars (Eccleston and Piper) scooped the most popular actor and actress honors in the awards voted by the public. Dr. Who (2005)was also nominated for not only the 2006 HUGO Award (announcing winners on Aug 26), but on May 7th it WON 5 of the most prestigious award British Television has to offer: the BAFTAS Awards (British Academy of FILM and TELEVISION ARTS) out of the 14 categories it was nominated. Winning for BEST DRAMA SERIES, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST MAKE-UP, BEST COSTUME, BEST DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and the PIONEER AUDIENCE AWARD which was voted for by the British public (kind of like the US People's Choice Award).WHEN it aired on SCI-FI FRIDAYS @8 PM CENTRAL there were some lines and moments cut from the original BBC versions, these are the complete episodes.Hopefully SCI-FI will pick up SEASON 2, starting with the post-regeneration CHRISTMAS INVASION because believe it or not the next 13 even better!!

First, Great Casting! David Tennant as Peter Vincent is inspired casting, as the decadent Las Vegas stage magician / vampire slayer. Seeing 'the Doctor' drop the F-Bomb(s) was a joy (although he was more Barty Crouch Jr. Meets Chris Angel as played by a Scottish Russell Brand, but brilliant!) Anton Yelchin (Star Trek)was reformed dweeb Charlie Brewster, playing the distracted would-be hero perfectly to type. Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) is good as Evil Ed, In this case Charlie's ex-sidekick now that Brewster is dating out of his league. Their classmates are disappearing, Ed is already wary of vampire goings-on and tries unsuccessfully to bring Charlie in on it.In the New Orleans papers they only got 2 stars, they (like some Amazon reviewers) clearly didn't get it... It was superbly done, perfect balance of tones, while being just enough of a tribute to the original ( in fact there's an obvious cameo ad well) but totally it's own film. A modern statue to the genre, darkly funny, but with some intense moments like the kill room sequence & some realistically panicked car fleeing scenes. Collin Farrell (Daredevil) played a perfect preator, without being campy, We opted not to see it in 3-D, I don't like the effect in dark movies, and Fright 'Night' , hello.

Even though I was Nintendo label die-hard and fan of their coin-op franchise from the beginning, Super Smash Bros or brawl titles in general haven't interested me too much.So the most anticipated title of 2008 wasn't guaranteed to strike my electric fancy. But, when you add WI-FI play for free online brawling and custom controls in order to configure anything from the Wii controllers to the old school (4 variations on play) you've got me curious. Add to that the longest list of cross-title cross-era characters ever produced (Thirtysomethings: remember "Battle of the Network Stars" ). Characters from `87s' Kid Icarus (Pit) and Metal Gear's Snake, Pikachu and various Pokemon. Loads of Mario characters including the man himself: Diddy and Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong dating from Mario's 1981 coin-op premiere of the title of the same name), Wario, Yoshi, Princess Peach, Bowser, and more. Other melee cameos include the Ice Climbers, Metroids' Zero Suit Samus, Kirby, King Dedede and his Meta Knight, Sonic, LINK & Zelda (from '86 and on), Star Fox, Lucas & friends from Mother 3... and lots of other unlockables. Some noteable, but Non-playable, assist trophies include Devil from Devil World, Star Fox's Andross, Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing, Little Mac from Tyson's Punch-Out and even Excitebike ('85) is on the scene. What is particularly cool about these appearances is the consistency of style for each character regardless of genre or era of the characters. Nintendo has outdone itself on graphics on this one, even when they are "dumbing" down the graphics for cross-game effect. The sound effects are true to this as well, with as many retro SFXs as cool new ones.Options for play include Solo vs. PC, Multiplayer play vs. 3 friends or on-line options. Other options include the Classic game (you beat `em you advance) or a storyplay campaign which is surprisingly worthwhile. The variety of Brawl locations and is amazingly broad as are the detailing of each location gimmicks. From Yoshi's Island to a stadium to the exterior of a StarFox ship sailing the stratosphere, this alone will extend the life of BRAWL's replay longevity. Characters move satisfyingly fluid, and their variety per character is exciting.The Mini-games are fun and nice samplings of other titles, both new and old. If fact, many of these made me ready to seek out some games I hadn't looked at before. If anything BRAWL is a great sampler title.Super Smash Bros. Brawl is going to be top of the "4 player fighting" genre for some time to come, I think. Well worth the release push-back.

The strength of DOCTOR WHO, the new series and the original, has always been change, and change it has. Over forty-years ago the show began with one actor and now we have 10 actors who have portrayed the 900+ Timelord. The first season of the new series ended by changing leads through regeneration, as the 2nd season ended with the "lost" of not only the companion / love interest, but the whole "point-of-view" for the new series: Rose Tyler. Since the PILOT or "ROSE" episode the series has been through her eyes. The viewers could relate to the Human perspective more readily than the sometimes alien POV of the title character. In fact, the series gave up not only Rose, but her family, Mickey Smith, Jackie Tyler; Mum, Pete Tyler ( deceased, sort of) ,all of the anchor characters that added so much emotion to the new series.Can the series, even one a clever and cool as Dr. Who, survive such change.The answer is yes, definitely, yes. Although, there is a loss, infact the sense of loss that the viewer feels, is surely an undercurrent of the entire season, starting with the Christmas special or THE RUNAWAY BRIDE, the precursor to the true first episode of the season. Opening right after series two leaves off, the Bride a.k.a Donna Noble played by U.K. comedian Catherine Tate appears in the TARDIS, the Doctor has little time to contemplate his loss before he is literally running for his life again. Like the Christmas Invasion, the special is light-hearted, and introduces a "one-shot" temporary companion (although Donna will be a major-part of season 4). One highlight of the "BRIDE" would be the glorious soundtrack provided by composer Murray Gold, a truly cinematic fully orchestral backdrop that sells some fanboy innovative moments like a CAR CHASE WITH THE TARDIS ( I kid u not, the iconic Call-box is zipping though traffic like something from a 70's cop-show) . Donna sums up the subtle theme as she declines the role of companion, stating that the Doctor needs someone to "stop him from going to far" as he coldly sticks to his assertion of the previous Christmas: "No second chances" while dispatching the Empress and her brood.In the second story in this set, but the actual season opener, new regular companion MARTHA JONES is introduced in a satisfying start to 2007 in "SMITH and JONES" ( a goof reference to the Doctor's sometimes alias of Dr. John Smith which shows up again in the season, too). An all too different character than Rose, Martha is Medical Student, so she doesn't need the Doctor to rescue her from her life as slacker Rose did, she's smart in a less pop culture way than Rose, more analytical like the Doctor. Like Rose, we meet her family in the episodes opening over several rapid-fire conversations via cellphone. Strange things are afoot at her hospital which eventually ends up on the Moon. More as window dressing, the Jadoon Stormtroopers, beautifully realized alien police are searching for an vampiric alien among the human patients and doctors. Martha and the Doctor immediately develop an enjoyable on screen chemistry, while storytellers cut to the chase and give us two instances of Doctor/Companion kisses, the throwaway nature establishes the preoccupied (with love-lost) tone that the Doctor will regard Martha (unfortunately more like a traditional Dr. Who relationship). The Doctor spells this out saying, "this doesn't mean anything," sadly for Martha, this feeling isn't mutual and leads to choices made by the end of the season. So the Doctor sacrifices himself to flush out the fugitive, while Martha literally breaths her final breath in an attempt to save the Doctor's life, earning herself a non-committal invite to the TARDIS.The major part of the first half of the 13 show season, 14 with the "Bride" Special (#0) is weak. Smith & Jones (#1) is strong, the Shakespeare Code (#2) is frankly BRILLIANT!GRIDLOCK (#3) is very good, but the Dalek 2 parter: "Daleks in Manhattan" and "Evolution of the Daleks (#4-5)", NOT SO BRILLIANT, nor is "Lazarius Experiment (#6)" or "42 (#7)" But the final HALF of the season (#8-13) is GOLDEN, leading up to a 3 part finale re-introducing a classic character that will blow you away!!! Away !!!"SHAKESPEARE CODE", Martha's first trip back in time, they meet the Bard himself and learn the secret of Shakespeare's famous lost play. This was film partly in the real rebuild Globe Theater, so it looks great. As is Dean Kelly's rock-n-roll performance as the renown playwright. This contains some of the best dialogue the series has EVER had, so much so that you much watch it repeatedly to truly appreciate this one ( I played this one to high-schoolers as a follow-up to Hamlet)."GRIDLOCK," is a great sci-fi story, in which people are living their lives stuck decades and decades on a skyway traffic jam. The is the 3rd story in the new series history to go to the far-future "New Earth" and the Doctor meets the Face of Boe for the prophesied 3rd and final time. A super concept with great effects and some genuinely moving moments, like the music montage of the stranded freeway drivers connected by faith and song. The Face reveals a secret to the Doctor which tips us off to the season finale.The DALEKS in MANHATTAN" and "EVOLUTION of the DALEKS" is the Doctor's apology to Martha for showing off taking her to New Earth on the rebound as it were, but overall this 2 part doesn't work. There is some great integration of footage actually shot in modern NYC, reworked to look like the 1920's, but the premise that the sole surviving Daleks (the Cult of Skaro, seen escaping last season's finale) are making not only PIG-Slaves, but the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING itself as part of a plan to recreate their race using humans for materials. There are some good performances all around, but the "Evolution" of the Human-Dalek (both costume and concept), is disappointing and distracting. But, the Art Deco 1930s style Empire State Build does lend itself to that of the Daleks.Episodes 6 and 7, "The LAZARIUS EXPERIMENT" and "42" are both so derivative of Popular sci-fi that they are unsatisfying when compared to some of the really great shows of the season. LAZARIUS is very much a variation on "the FLY" while "42" with its real time concept ("24" reversed) and spacecraft claustrophobia is like both Impossible Planet of last season and other movies of the genre. But, Dr. Lazarius himself is afforded an excellent performance by Dr. Who writer Mark Gatiss ( of "League of Gentlemen" and "Jekyll").Again proving that the producers are true fans themselves, episodes 8 and 9, Human Nature and The Family of Blood, are based on a fan favorite Dr. Who Novel (with the 7th Doctor), translating seamlessly to TV. It is a classic story idea, the Doctor becomes Human!! In order to escape a family of aliens ( a concept already borrowed from the novel for season one's Slitheens, an alien surname) the Doctor puts his Timelord identity into a watch, only Martha knows who he is and is put in charge of this secret as he really becomes John Smith, History teacher (of course) of a boys school just before WWI. I can't say enough about the heart-wrenching excellence of this 2 parter. The Doctor falls in love and must make some hard choices. This also sets up things to come in the finale.Episode 10, "BLINK," happens to be filler, like last seasons "Love and Monsters" in which the regular cast is all but absent in order to shoot another episode simultaneously. Like "Love and Monsters" this episode is a creative triumph, also base on a previously published story. "BLINK" also happens to be the scariest show of the new series history!In a nutshell, the Doctor is sending messages from the past to "the present" through DVD extras or easter eggs, warning about weeping angel statues that move at you when no one is looking, so don't even blink! Although, no one is killed on screen, not in any conventional sense, this one is still keeping my kids up at night (especially in a city famous for its cemeteries) ! BLINK was written by Steven Moffat, two-time consequtive HUGO winner (both for DR.WHO, series 2 the "GIRL IN THE FIREPLACE" and series one's "EMPTY CHILD." Moffat has next year's Hugo in the bag with BLINK, if his writing in JEKYLL doesn't split the vote (see my review for more on JEKYLL).The final 3 parter, "UTOPIA", "The SOUND of DRUMS" and "LAST of the TIMELORDS" are perfection. Really. I can say more without revealing too much (although the U.K. press already did that long before the shows aired), but the season is full of clues leading up to this (even in TORCHWOODS final episodes there are clues). Capt. Jack returns for all three of these and there are notable guest appearances such as SIR DEREK JACOBI ( famous for I, Claudius), how great is that!! Also, John Sims (from Life on Mars). The first of these 3 parts, UTOPIA, comes across as a Mad Max deal, don't give up on it, that is just subterfuge! Make plans to watch the three of these back-to-back-to-back, you're not gonna' want to stop.

The major dynamic of Doctor Who has always been one of change, after all it IS a show about a 900+ year-old face-swapping, regenerating Timelord with no-fixed-abode, each week an entirely new location, with a new cast of characters. It's because of this dynamic that the series has had such (multimedia) longevity. With series 4, of the new series we see a continuation of this, with the return of Donna Noble from the Christmas Invasion Special of 2006. But, this isn't the same Donna, she herself has changed as a character for having adventured with the Doctor, although she still, thankfully, is not as in awe of the Doctor as Rose in series 1, or in love as Rose in series 2, or struck love-sick with the unobtainable man as Martha in series 3. Donna has a unique perspective on the Doctor and his universe, almost seeing herself as an equal, if unsure of her abilities, but not so completely trusting of the Doctor. As Rose grew into the role of companion, so does Donna, but her journey isn't as simple, she may be the everyman companion (like Sally Sparrow or the men of LINDA). The show's overall perspective has changed, Rose and Martha held the point of view, unraveling the mysteries (for the viewer) of the Doctor and his world, especially with the angry and enigmatic Chris E's 9th Doctor. But now with David Tennant's 10th Doctor the audience knows more about the "last of the Timelords" than any companion, we don't need the companion as an anchor, thus we has Donna on an even playing field, and an excuse to bring back Martha (also changed for her travels)...an maybe Rose?This season the series has no major catchwords like "BAD WOLF" or "TORCHWOOD" and who can forget "MR. SAXON." Season 4 is bound by other elements, a person, phrase, a prophetic statement/question, a place, building up, so pay attention. These elements aren't clues from this season alone, but references planted going as far back as the first season, or a recently as quotes from the Master in last season's finale, remember "The Crucible," "Medusa Cascade" or the "Shadow Proclaimation?"What else this season has is loads of great stories from award-winning writers and loads of great performances from award-winning celebrity cameos: Nigel Terry (Excalibur), kylie Minogue, Felicity Kendal, Alex Kingston (ER), Colin Salmon (MI6), Christopher Ryan (the Young Ones), Geoffrey Palmer, Georgia Moffett (the Last Detective) and more. Of course, there are loads of great performances from the series regulars. David Tennant ads so much depth to what was a relatively static character, in the series original successful run. His Doctor still enabling the everyman to act, to be a hero. Along with Catherine Tate, their sense of pathos and comedic timing are nothing short of A-list quality.DVD set includes:(mild spoilers follow...)Time Crash: a fully finished short for the "Children in Need" UK charity featuring the 5th Doctor (Peter Davison) meeting the 10th Doctor, written by Steven Moffat.This is a direct precursor to the 2007 Christmas Special, in fact it really occurs a few minutes before the final seconds of Season 3's finale."The Voyage of the Damned" or the 2007 Christmas Special. Now a Christmas Day tradition, since the 10th Doctor, newly regenerated came to our screens, this is the 3rd such special. This special is very derivative of the action film genre, more so that the previous specials, or Doctor Who as a whole. Moments very-like the Die Hard of your choice appear throughout "Voyage" while Tennant's Doctor is somewhat muted early on here. The Doctor this time out is rescuing the passengers and crew of the Starship TITANIC, a intergalactic cruise liner visiting scenic Earth, where disaster ensues and the Doctor's promises of salvation to the nicely eclectic gallery of survivors proves to be to much to handle. The Sweet, but over-rated and inappropriately aged Kylie Minogue as Astrid, a temp companion who dreams of seeing the galaxy, help the Doctor to resolve the sinister corporate machinations of Max Capricorn, at an extreme cost. Some elements are the angelic robo-baddies, homage to "the Robots of Death" and another classic iconic juxtaposition of holiday imagery.The first of the real season is "Partners in Crime" in which we rejoin Donna Noble from the Runaway Bride special and for an opening night episode, it still feel like on of the specials. It is fun, face-paced and over-the-top, it too has some Die Hard moments. Since turning down the Doctor's initial offer to travel, she has changed her mind and been investigating on her own hoping to one day run into the Doctor, and so she does. She also runs into CEO, Miss Foster who offers an unsuspecting public new way to lose weight with a sinister secret, well sinister may be to harsh a word, but let's just say that the fat "just walks away." This one, is a bit of fun fluff, but the episode closer offers quite a twist.The second of the season is "The Fires of Pompeii" or should I say "Volcano Day." Filmed in Rome on the massive set from the HBO/BBC sets and other Mediterranean locales, we see some of the hard historical choices the Doctor must make, a choice I though he would have faced on the real Titanic, had it not been a Starship. In a fixed point in history...Who lives and who dies in the eruption of Vesuvius? This one has got it all, molten rock monsters, togas and Donna pleading for the Doctor to save someone. From the opening to the ending of this one Donna is asking so great and obvious questions (for example, if the TARDIS translates English to Latin & Latin to English, what happens when you speak Latin?).The third episode "Planet of the OOD" resolves the plight of the subservient, tentacle-mouthed slaves from The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit of 2006. The Doctor didn't really do right by them the last time around, but in his defense he was busy fighting the Devil. The OOD are both creepy and sympathetic simultaneously. This time the OOD are more than just tools, and yet again we have the motif of an evil CEO who needs comeuppance (3 of 4).The fourth and fifth episodes "The Sontaran Stratagem" and "Poison Sky" obviously see the return of the potato-headed clone soldiers (pre-dating Lucas' clone troopers from "the Time Warrior"). This 2 parter also sees the return of UNIT and Dr. Martha Jones and if you missed her episodes of Torchwood series 2, she is a more confident, bolder character than when she and the Doctor parted ways. This one has another evil corporation and evil SAT-NAVs. These two are great "old school" episodes, Christopher Ryan brilliantly plays Sontaran General Staal. Watch the TARDIS monitor for another clue to the season finale.The sixth episode title was kept secret until the week before broadcast, "the Doctor's Daughter." This is a really nicely done story, with some great castingIncluding Nigel Terry (King Arthur from Excalibur) and Georgia Moffett (who is really the Doctor's daughter, 5th Doctor Peter Davison's real kid, who was nearly cast as Rose for 2005). Penned by Stephen Greenhorn, who wrote last season Lazarus Experiment, setting out to write a story that forever leaves the central character changed by the end.The seventh episode, the Wasp and the Unicorn, is the latest from writer Gareth Roberts, the "historical cameo" king. Having written Charles Dickens & Christmas Ghosts, Queen Victoria meeting a werewolf and Shakespeare with Witches, who better to write a manor house mystery with Agatha Christie?Done with spinning newspaper, flashbacks and a body in the study, this one is a really Doctor-Who-dunnit (sorry). It has lots of cameos, some Dr. Who vets and David Tennant's DAD as the BUTLER!The long awaited 2-parter from writer 2 time HUGO-award winner Steven Moffat (Blink, Empty Child), "Silence in the Library" and "the Forest of the Dead" has awards written all over it. The shadows themselves are the enemy on a planet-sized Library and who is the mysterious archeologist River Song, who seems to intimately familiar with the Doctor, could she be Mrs. The Doctor? ...Anyway, if you read any of the New Adventures (of Doctor Who) in the 90's the spirit of this story will seem a very familiar homage (Google Prof. Benny Summerfield for more, irony here is her creator Paul Cornell didn't write an episode this season). River Song is played perfectly by the beautiful and talented Alex Kingston, adds to the increasing foreboding clues toward a bleak something on the horizon for Donna.Episode ten, "Midnight" while Donna relaxes poolside the Doctor goes on a 4 hour tour (you just can trust them). The Doctor and an unlikely tour group visit the surface of the "unihabited/unihabitable" planet of Midnight...but who's outside and who has gotten in? A great answer to the Voyage of the Damned in which a disaster brings out the best in mankind, here we see people turn on each other (and the Doctor) in fear, human nature at its ugliest. This "bottle" episode contained to the "space-truck's" cabin, is claustrophobic and although it contains no monster reveal it is one of the season's most frightening shows since the angels. Props to the sound crew/editors on this one, no visual effects make the sound all the more important! Also, after the 5th Doctor's real daughter, we this time get the 2nd Doctor's son David Troughton is onboard.Episode eleven "Turn Left" again by RTD himself leading us into the dark waters of the season four 3 part finale to come...hold on! This Doctor-light episode sees the special return of an companion and UNIT as things begin to get bad as a threat to more than just the Earth is revealed.Episode twelve, "The Stolen Earth" the Doctor's team prepare to battle the new ***** Empire, lead by *****.Final episode, concluding the tight 3 part story arc, "Journey's End"! Like last season, the season finale features the return of another major classic Dr. Who villain!Fear not, next season WILL have a Christmas special and 4 more specials to hold us over `til "delayed" season 5 airs. The specials will be the last produced by the remaining original 2005 team as Executive producer Julie Gardner and Phil Collinson has already left and Executive Producer Russell T. Davies will leave following the specials. Steven Moffat will take over for RTD. The full 5th season (2010) may be the time for 10th Doctor's own Journey to end, remember what I said about change, don't worry about that for now, just enjoy this amazing 14 episode DVD set."

Finally, the second volume of the animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars by the Samurai Jack production team. Director Genndy Tartakovsky, obviously a fan of the Star Wars Saga, fills this series with more scenes that fans have waited for that even George Lucas hasn't delivered, for example: The "Knighting" of a Jedi, Windu fighting airborne, while Yoda fights an overwhelming invasion force on Coruscant, much more. The angular stylized animation is a visual feast for all generations. This volume continues where the first left off, with General Grievous, while the war continues, Anakin Skywalker undergoes his final rite of passage, while Master Shaak Ti and other Jedi try to defend the Supreme Chancellor from the General. Clone Wars Vol. II. aired just before the release of Episode III., the series efficiently bridges the Episode II/III. gap, the events in the final chapters (21-25) leading directly to the opening of the movie. Unseen events from the opening crawl are elaborated on like how the Chancellor is kidnapped, how Coruscant strike happens and C-3PO, voiced by the "real deal" (Anthony Daniels), revealing his new "suit." After the 3 minute chapters of "season one" the extended 12 minute chapters are better suited to the more envolved story-line(s).A must-have for Star Wars and animation fans. Clone Wars Vol.II., like it's predecessor, is an excellent vehicle to introduce the uninitiated to "the Saga."

The popularity of the "superpower school genre" is at an all-time high with post-pubescent, pre-cape, Superman in Smallville and the Harry Potter franchise entering into the high school years, not to mention the success of Prof. Xaiver's school of mutants. Spidey is in collage now, but lets not forget his super-power secondary school antics or Dash Parr's elementary school track records. So naturally the time was right for a film that is part "Breakfast Club" and part "Fantastic Four." Sky High is the predictable coming-of-age spoof with a superhero shtick. Will Stronghold, the protagonist teen, and the son of two of Earth's greatest heroes (played terrifically by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston) has a lot to live-up to, but no powers to speak of (at first). Adding to his natural teen anxieties Will is surrounded by "gifted" teens and intense teachers including Bruce Campbell, Lynda Carter, and Cloris Leachman. Ex-"Kids-in the-Hall" Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, best known in Disney circles as the voice of Pleakley in the Stitch series, are terrific together as Mr. Boy and Mr. Medulla. The film has some twisted, yet familiar takes on high school hierarchies, archetypes and academic labels, the first is introduced though the superhero power placement test, which gives a whole new meaning to standardized testing not to mention the obligatory embarrassing gym activities. This classifies the students as "Hero" or "Sidekick."Effects are important in the superhero genre, even the super-sub genres.The visuals are just the right balance of comic book realism, some key moments being the transformation of the mild-mannered school bus into the supersonic Sky High Bus and the "Save the Citizen" homage to the X-Men's Danger Room is great fun.The soundtrack is the perfect clue to the `80's high school spoof with tunes you might misremember hearing in "Sixteen Candles" but, it definitely adds the right flavor. Young pop groups and Grammy nominated bands perform covers of classic teen film tunes, like Bowling for Soup's appropriate inclusion "Melt with You," Vitamin C's remake of "Voice Carry" or Steven Straight with "One Thing Leads to Another" and more (checkout CD).Overall, super-family fun for the whole family, but may disappoint hardcore comic fans in it pedestrian handling of the material, especially on the heels of similarly themed projects like "The Incredibles."

Alright! A Zombie Book by Steven King! What more can you ask for!? Don't complain about it...enjoy it. King dedicates this one to the Godfather of Zombie flick George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn/Day/Land of the Dead, also work by King himself) and the second half of King's dedication is to Richard Matheson, who wrote "I am Legend", a classic, heavily-homaged horror novel (see 28 DAYS LATER, the LAST MAN ON EARTH or the OMEGA MAN).THE STORY: It's CLASSIC KINGWhat if a "pulse" sent out through cell phones turned every person using one of them into a zombie-like killing machine? That's what U get right from the start of this one. We get another look at the end of civilization. Those who are not on a cell during the event remain normal. Like protagonist Clayton Riddell, an artist from "DUH" Maine, in Boston for work when the disturbing events of the novel violent unfold around him. Clay attempt to return home to his wife and son along with fellow refugees through post-pulse Boston paces CELL's plot.The RESULT:King is at his best when he takes the "normal" and twists it just enough to creep us out. Cars, Family Pets, and Cellphones, he'll turn anything familiar against us, and WE LOVE IT!!! He colors his canvas with more mundane touches by referring to name-brand stuff, using pop-culture in ways that risk dating his work (in the long run), but it's worth the pay-off, which is to sell the reality of a place we could be ourselves. King makes us think the unthinkable, and "I think" he is really, really good at it!

Take it from a Monty Python fan who's planning a New York trip around this production, this is a must have for an self-respecting Pythonier. This album features the current and original Broadway cast of the new musical (opened March 17, 2005) based on the infamous "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." Python member Eric Idle co-produces, lovingly ripping off moments and songs from the original. Although there are more than enough new material to make up for such indiscretions, like the inclusion of Life of Brian's "Bright Side of Life." In fact, any fear of redundancy is squished as if by a big Flying Circus foot, when stars like David Hyde-Pierce, Tim Curry, Hank Azaria lend their talents and voices to giving a fresh face to this much revered material. And speaking of fresh faces, with the introduction of the Lady of the Lake, played by Sara Ramirez, who is only referenced briefly in the movie, Spamalot achieves new levels of Broadway satire. For example, Ramirez is featured in the hilarious "The Song That Goes Like This," and "Whatever Happened To My Part?" a shot at stage and divas in general.Tim Curry (of Rocky Horror and the recent CD readings of the Lemony Snicket series) sounds terrific, his voice is better now than ever. While this is no substitute for see the production, I think, along with all of its links (like the historian's intros) the albumn creates a great feel for the stage show's energy. So Runnn Awwway to buy this CD.

If you have never sat down for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, the series, you are in for a real treat. Imagine going to a midnight screening of a "B" or "C" movie with couple of your best buds, cutting-up and goofin' on weak plot points, weaker FX and questionable acting. If you can imagine all that, then add the sci-fi genre to the mix, turn your two buds into puppet robots with some stinging-sardonic wit and you've got it.Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie, is the post-mortem theatrical release following the series final run on Comedy Central. It is a polished presentation along with some primer origin info enough to help clue-in any newbies to the series. Mad Doctor Forester returns to throw bad movies at Mike, the temp, and his robots on the "Satellite of Love." But this time it isn't really a bad movie, so much as a retro-classic, "This Island Earth." If the title doesn't strike a cord, the crazy-bug-eyed, bulbous brained big clamp alien monster will seem familiar, at least.The boys are on their game in this one, including Dr. F., the jokes fly fast and loose, some of which I still quote to this day. The sets are theatrical release quality, as are the edits and music. If you're a fan of the series, it will feel like the typical small screen to big screen transition, in fact, that very transition feels like an extension of the genre satire indicative of the MST3K brand, in it's classic form!The MST3K movie has been long overdue for release, now we can add this to the increasing releases of 7 years of the original series, or you can start with this one. Either way I'd recommend it.One down side...unlike some of the TV series DVDs, this one doesn't have both the MST3k version and the original version of the film. This DVD doesn't really have any extras at all, but I'm still happy to have it.

The MAGNETIX system is a construction activity based on combining steel balls and magnetic rods, joined together to create whatever shapes and objects you can think up. The play is limited to which expansion set you have, the 35 pc. is an ok starter, but it lacks any structural aids like the wall shapes or the longer flexible attachments. All-in-all a fun time can be had with a couple of set variants. Some of the variants are hard to find like the "Glow-in-the-dark" set.System could easily transfer nicely to the classroom, for math and science projects building models. Having children construct square, triangle and other shapes or using MAGNETIC x-treme for more architecturally directed play linking and locking assembly connectors.Does contain small chrome parts that present a choking hazzard for children under-3 yrs.

Before Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, the late Douglas Adams (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) re-penned this goofy romp through Paris, history and prehistory. He has the badie planning to steal the Mona Lisa in order to sell fakes that aren't fake at all, then executing said plan in order to fund his secret, posthumous, alien-agenda."City of Death", broadcast in 1979 as the second story of season seventeen, is one of the few outstanding story arcs in one of the weakest Tom Baker seasons. Although, the guest cast and cameos are impressive, featuring Julian Glover (Indiana Jone and the Last Crusade) , Catherine Schell and David Graham amongst others, with John Cleese and Eleanor Bron (in episode four). The script full of clever, inspired dialogue and the location filming in Paris, a first for the show, makes the story seem more impressive. Tom Baker's over the top humorous acting does seem to fit the bill here. Lalla Ward as Romana is still finding her character (given her unfortunate choice of outfits in this) in her second story, but the relationship between her and Baker is developing so nicely (in and out-of-character, the couple married later) that the story is a pleasure to watch. Then, the addition of the thick, British detective Duggan provides for a good foil for the pair. There are moment's of classic Adams' Adams' brilliance, like the Doctor writing "This is a Fake!" on DaVinci's canvases or his intial scream as thumb-screws are applied to his hands yelling, "His hands are cold." This was Adams' last Dr. Who script, "SHADA", was abandoned midway through filming due to a BBC strike and he didn't continue as the script editor. Although, had it been completed, "Shada" would have proved a better story than "City." What I remember most about seeing "City of Death" sticks out now upon a more recent screening as, "a lot of running around Paris, with some time travel tossed in the mix."Normally I love DVD extras, especially on Dr. Who DVDs, this wasn't one of those times. The extras have been added to a second disc, thus raising the cost for what in this case seems like no good reason (unlike "Curse of Fenric"). Unused studio footage and out-takes from episode one, a look at the locations, a short documentary. These bonuses aren't all that great, they're too long, repeating information already available in the text, the post adventure faux documentary about the alien character's life after the show isn't very good. The commentary is also disappointing, without Baker or Ward (nor the late Douglas Adams) taking part with the job left to the director and the two guest actors, Julian Glover and Tom Chadbon with little to relate about the series as a whole. I'm not clear on the process used for selecting the order that Dr. Who DVDs are being released, but there are better Tom Baker 4th Doctor episodes out there than should be released first."City of Death," like the Doctor says about 1979, "is more a table wine, really."On the technical difficulty issues of the DVD my intial sealed copy came with two discs both the EXTRAS and NO Feature disc!!Beware.

This solid family movie from director Shawn Levy (the new PINK PANTHER, CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2) comes from a solid book like Jumanji, and Zathura, the 1993 kid's mystery-comedy of the same name.Like the original story, Larry (or was it Hector originally) becomes a night guard at New York's Museum of Natural History,in order to "grow up" in the eyes of his ex-wife and his son. He expects to have an easy time. But on his first night, he dozes off, then wakes up to a missing dinosaur skeleton.Soon his learns that history really comes alive at this museum and he's got his hands full keeping it in line.Ben Stiller, as Larry, panics his way from exhibit to exhibit,as only he knows how. Briefly intiated by the original nightwatchmen, played by comedy, TV and film legends Dick Van Dyke,Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney.The retiring watchmen are worth the price of admission (watch the closing credits as they reveal the ultimate fate of the three characters and Mr. Van Dyke shows that he can still chimney-sweep with the best of them.Owen Wilson yet again teams-up with Stiller for a small part literally, he's a miniature from an historical diorama (see Starsky & Hutch, The Royal Tenenbaums, Meet the parents, Permanent Midnight, Zoolander for more super Stiller/Wilson team-ups). Actually the role is more than a cameo and is worthy of the story. The two play off each other superbly, like a modern-day Bing & Hope, only funny (I Kid, I Kid).Another standout casting is Robin Williams lending Larry a hand as an animated-wax Teddy Roosevelt. Williams is able to savory his moments of insanity as a relatively static historical mentor while enfusing others with moving realism and soulfulness (seriously).Loads of great visuals, especially at the IMAX engagements, like the animated dog-like T-Rex, Mammoths, stampedes and more. Definitely in the spirit of Jumanji, only with much more heart.

Meg Finn's soul hangs in the balance between Heaven and Hell, she must return to Earth to shift the balance to good. Specifically she must partner up with an old man she wronged just before her death, help set his life to right. Meg is hindered by her undead ex-partner in crime, who didn't fare as well as her in the hereafter, fused together with his dog and working for the Devil.Like the Artemis Fowl series, Eoin Colfer, mixes magic and mundane, science and supernatural to create a strange "para"-paranormal world that has an afterlife with it's own bureaucracy and office supplies. The "last chance" concept, while not strikingly original (ex. Ghost, Heaven's Gate, etc.) is done in clever, inoffensive manner. The main character is believable and at most times likable, the villains are interesting enough, not particularly fleshed out, but then they are supposed to be ghosts.

If you thought the return of the Doctor was over with the regeneration of the Doctor, you haven't seen David Tennant(Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)as the tenth incarnation of the Timelord. Just as loaded with emotion depth and darkness as Chris E's Doc, but with a more traditional streak of classic quirky Doctor traits.The Doctor is suffering from post-regeneration stress on the X-mas special opener "THE CHRISTMAS INVASION." Although the Doctor is out-of-it for a major part of the special, Billie Piper and crew carry on superbly until the climax. The greatness of the season opener is no exception, nearly all of the season two episodes are perfect!The weakest episode is the New Earth (#2)which is the first to competely feature the new Doctor. The Cat-nurse hospital is true to the spirit of the series, but the best parts are body swaping moments in which Rose becomes the posh Cassandra from season one, and so does the Doctor (insanely funny, both performances). The rest of the season features some of the best work ever done in the shows 30+ history, bar none! Other reasons to buy this set:The Doctor finally meets a werewolfThe return of Parallel universesThe return of Peter TylerThe return of the CybermanThe return of K9The return of Sarah JaneThe return of mysterious reference threads (TORCHWOOD)The return of another long time villain(s)in a long overdue monster mash smackdown of epic proportions!The School Reunion, which features the Doctor's reunion with fan-fav compainion Sarah Jane Smith & K9, is a touching and tightly composed story that nicely sets the tone forshadowing things to come, namely the amazing season finale.The writing is terrific in each episode, the reinvention of the Cybermen, set up more stories that the fans themselve would have written. The Cybermen return for the finale along with some legendary uninvited party guest. Just like last season, you'll be asking yourself "why hasn't someone done these stories already, WOW!"Bring on the 3 season! Love & Monsters 4 ever!

Dear listeners...Tim Curry, the voice of the Snicket series, just as Jim Dale is the voice of the Potter series, has reached further still in unabridged audio version of the second to lastbook in the Baudelaire's story of woe. Curry has the prefect dark and quirky style to compliment quirky and, in this instance, sometimes sad, sometimes exciting material. This "Orphan" work in particular has the most characters appearing ( and reappearing ) to date, so the stage and screen actor most famous for "Rocky Horror Picture Show," has his work cut out for him here. Although, I was disappointed that AMAZON did not offer the CD version, I still can wait for the next and final book and the next audio adaptation.

This is an ok product...Understanding that the Twinlab's Ripped Fuel is not a diet plan, nor is it a substitute for the gym. You need to be spending time training to see results. It does what it says, more efficiently uses calories without overloading you with caffeine. I didn't notice any exceptional results, but like other health pills or vitamin sups, you use them to put the odds in your favor of increasing your health. This product seems less risky than other metabolic enhancers that use chromium picolinate, which could have more side effects than this product.If, taken in the late evening it, may cause sleeplessness, but as you are to take one daily, before eating, you shouldn't eat hours before sleeping anyway. I suggest a pre-lunch dose. I haven't had any problems to speak of while using this product, it has caused any stomach problems for me, which was a major concern of mine after using other "burners" containing chromium picolinate caused severe abdominal cramping. I've had no ill effects to report.I'm satisfied with the product, although I would not rule out experimenting with some other brands and variations.

This is one of my least favorite Dalek story arcs. The story isn't great, failing to justify the use of the Daleks and their creator and the cameos are weak and forced.Thanks to the 2005 reinvention of the series, not to metion the amazing revamp of the Daleks, there is plenty of Dalek DVDs to choose from and get more sci-fi-satisfaction: The Daleks (from the 1st Doctor's Beginnings Set), Genesis of the Daleks (possibly the best, see my review), Ressurection of the Daleks ( some great 5th Doctor moments).....

The origin of Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Capt. Hook and Neverland itself, what else could you ask for? How about a prequel to the 100 year old classic co-written by Dave Barry? How about an unabridged reading by JIM DALE, best known as the voice of the HARRY POTTER audios. Well boy, are you in luck!!!!Thanks to Mr. Dave Barry, Mr. Ridley Pearson and Mr. Jim Dale the characters come alive in the same way that the darlings did upon a first read. The magic lives in the rapport between a famous pirate and his oafish first-mate, the rapport between Peter and the boys. Award-winning Jim Dale give each character a clear voice and unique enough dialect so that the listener can sort out who is saying what from moment to moment, with little cues from the author.Since it is a prequel the absence of the Darlings is keenly felt, but Peter's reactions to willful Molly the Starcatcher's apprentice is a fine precursor to his later behavior towardsWendy in the original. Dave Barry's sense of humor lends it self easily to the material and to Dale's reading of "Starchasers."

"Artemis Fowl" Author Eoin Colfer was asked at his 40th birthday party why he hadn't written a "teen book" yet. After this, and spending the evening recounting adventures with his childhood friends, this book is the end product. THE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT THE "NOT SO INNOCENT."The novel tells the hilarious exploits of another pre-teen genius Fletcher Moon, a mere 12 years old and already a graduate of an online detective course with a badge and everything. Fletcher Moon has never been like other kids. For one thing, he has had to suffer the humiliating nickname "Half Moon" because of his short stature. But the real reason Fletcher is different is that ever since he was born, he's had the nose for sniffing out mysteries. His first case: April Devereux, classmate and archetypical "mean girl", hires him to find out who swiped the lock of a pop star's hair that she bought on eBay. Suspicion centers on Red Sharkey, oldest son of the town's most notorious crime family. Unraveling the mystery leads Fletcher to break rule No. 1 in his detective's handbook-"Be invisible"-as Fletcher follows the clues, a conspiracy begins to emerge. But before he can solve the case, his prized badge goes missing and Fletcher finds himself framed for a serious crime. To clear his name, he will have to go on the run from the authorities, and ally himself with his chief suspect, left with 12 hours to prove his innocence by finding the guilty party.In typical Eoin Colfer style the supporting characters are large in number, but are definitely not without distinction: a tyrant school principal aided by menacing twin Dobermans, and Fletcher's older sister, Hazel, who works out her boy troubles by writing plays and poetry while locked in her bedroom, Moon's eight-year-old, snot-nosed snitch who always has green yo-yo's hanging from his nostrils that he snorts in and out. And Fletcher himself, who with the world-weary..I mean...school-weary style of the dime=store detective, tells his tale, and the process gets: brained, nearly beat up, knocked out, knock-down and more. If only it were in black and white. It is plain to seen Colfer enjoyed writing about characters he really knew growing up, and this book has some of his best banter and most likable characters. This time Colfer's setting is suburban, but as always tailored specifically to Ireland, which is part of his series' charm. It's got `hurling" and "Step-dancing" how can you not love it? While the ending leaves a trail for future investigations. I'll be looking forward to more installments in this series. Readers ages 9-up.

Whether you are a fan of RPGs, the SW movies, or both, you will find this book to be a great referance tool. It provides stats, campaign hooks, archetypes and a fair amount of Sith history. Anyone familiar with the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; of comic and novels will appreciate the effort this text makes to include information for adventures in any possible era (from the Sith Empire to the New Republic). You can judge this book by its cover. The art is beautiful and disturbing, both inside and out.

3-hour-tour can easily become a 3 day gaming sessionSims 2: CASTAWAY is exactly what you'd expect if you are remotely familiar with the SIMs franchise. Sims 2: CASTAWAY is essentially SIMs surviving on an uncharted deserted isle. Part Survior, part Gilligan and another Tom Hanks, with all the classic scenarios and archetypes of the "LOST @ SEA" genre. CASTAWAY is as addictive as are all SIMs titles. A 3-hour-tour can easily become a 3 day gaming session.It is obviously a one-shot affair, like the recent "Pet" release so no prior experience with any SIMs titles is required, but like the other titles the SIMs react according how you've constructed the personalities to respond to their situations and your management, too. They need to Eat, Sleep, Socialize, have time appreciate "the Arts" and have some makeshift civilized creature Comforts including island outhouses.Like most self-contained SIMs games the ability to customize your SIM is more limited than in the PC series. You can morph faces and bodies into your desired characters. Beach and boatwear can be selected along with hats, hairstyles and jewelry. Once you get to the island you can upkeep your appearance with a sewing kit or make clothing from your surroundings, provided you are creative enough. Like other games in the franchise you assign points to your 5 personality traits which influence the way your SIM will respond to your commands as well as how they will respond to each other. You learn by doing and build up skills through effort and application, even fast with skills that are compatible with your SIM's personality. For example: fashioning tools is a mechanical skill and builds up your skill level through uses as simple as building a fire or repairing a radio transmitter.There are classic genre subplots to become involved in while your struggle to survive and/or escape for the island. There are mysterious caves to explore, airplane wreckage to scavenge, jungles to search, rafts to build and volcanoes to climb. First you must reassemble your "lost" crew of SIMs you can make up to 6 and choose one to start; this must enlist the aid of local monkeys and resources to do this. But, even after you find them you have to develop good relations with them in order to persuade them to "join the Tribe." There are other goals to accomplish with some aid from lost journals and survival texts you can discover. In the mean time there are monsoons, quaking volcanoes and rough seas ahead.Some suggestions for play: There are no limits on how much inventory you can have so start collecting, you'll eventually use it all. Start making rope and twine early, they have lots of uses, like the sewing kit, which if fabricated early enough can save your original outfits from permanent disrepair (jeans will remain shorts if you don't catch them early, this will keep your "Comfort" level higher as will haircuts, also provided by the sewing kit). Build a shelter and a bed, these will provide longer lasting rest periods and cut down on time lost sleeping. Build a home Tiki in order to assign jobs to your SIMs, so they will help collect or cook with out being instructed to do so. A campfire will provide warmth and cook food, but a island-made grill will cook more longer sustaining food. Build tools to aid your SIMs like fishing spears & poles. Tools like the hoe and collected ash will allow you to plant a garden and limit your food gathering to a trip outside the hut. Build-up your Body skill harvesting wood and collecting resources in order to be strong row a canoe to an outer island or climb across a chasm.Goodluck little buddies.

For 3 story-arcs of classic Dr. Who, this is a really good price for a set, especially one including Logopolis and Castrovalva (both of which I've been tempted to by on VHS just to see them again). These are part of the iconic Tom Baker's run as the 4th Doctor and the end of his final season in the role. K9 is gone, as is Romana. He wears his plum digs that suit the somber mood of his last 2 stories: The Keeper Of Traken, Logopolis, and Castrovalva.Disc ONE: The set opens with the Keeper of Traken which reintroduces the Master (absent since a showdown with the Doctor in Deadly Assassin). At the end of his 13th incarnation (12th regeneration) he stays in the shadows (so to speak) for much of the 1st half of this one, but by the end he is literally a new man.This one introduces Nyssa, eventually to become the new Zo, brainy-girl on board the TARDIS, while Adric, equally brainy but not really sensible is also on board for all 3 of these (when will they learn that the super-genius kid is an annoying archetype). The plot of this one is shaky but necessary for the reoccurring role the Master is to have in the 5th Doctors run.Disc TWO: Next is Logopolis. If Keeper of Traken is somber, then Logopolis is literally the wake before the funeral. The Doctor is more visable distressed over leaving Romana in E-space (still waiting for the DVD E-space 3 set). His plans to fix the long broken TARDIS chameleon circuit on Logopolis. Before doing so, he must find a real police call-box to measure, but in doing so inadvertently lands around the "new Master's" TARDIS, which ultimately leads to the death of the Doctor (well mortal wounding anyway). Loads of moody shots, in and out of the TARDIS, lots of quirky labyrinthine scenes with future companion Tegan lost onboard. The new Master is terrifically, theatrically hammy and plays nicely off Baker's manic energy (although substantially drained by his standards, in character the Doctor seems to have stoically accepted his impending death as Baker has stoically accepts his retirement.) He leaves at the top of his game here, a great, great story.Disc Three: Castrovalva introduces the 5th, and youngest Doctor (at the time I'm not sure about Tennant's age). Peter Davidson, brings the character away from the 4th Doctor's style and borrows heavily from the older Doctors ( in spite of his youth, he plays it more like the stogy old original incarnation played by William Hartnell.) When filming, the shooting order was altered so that, although this is the first of the new Doctor's episodes, it was shot after Four to Doomsday (story 2 of the season). So Davidson knew where his regeneration addled transformation would end up, because he had already filmed as the wholly recuperated Doctor. But the process is a hard one, Castrovalva opens immediately after the Doctor's regeneration, as his companions try to get him to safety, narrowly escaping the Master, or so it seems.While the Doctor struggles to retain/ regain his wits (see brilliant scenes with the Doctor struggling not to lose his way by unraveling the 4th Doctor's iconic scarf).The crew falls deeper into the Master's web of traps as the arrive on Castrovalva, appropriately named after the M.C. Escher work. A great start for the new Doctor.New Beginnings: Drinking GamesDrink whenever you hear the "Cloister Bell" (the ringing of which means emanate danger or drunkenness)Drink when the MASTER watches / rebukes the Doctor from the gloomy safety of his TARDIS console room.Drink whenever one actor or character replaces another via regeneration / body snatching / disguise or miscasting.Drink whenever someone misplaces the Doctor (including himself).Drink whenever anyone declares: "But, the Doctor's in there!"Drink when any of the TARDIS crew complains. This is the one that pays off!

This review is spoiler-free!"There are some injuries you can't cure...old curses ...and there are poisons without antidotes" Hermione tells Harry this during the first feast of the school year, setting the table for the course to come. The mood: at times Somber- but so many of the elements that made the other books work are so perfectly balanced in this one , that, dare I say it: THIS MAY BE THE BEST POTTER BOOK YET! I know that is the mantra of so many beloved books, in so many beloved series including this one, but I have always held my personal favorite to be book 3 ( Prisoner of Azkaban) with props to 4 and 5 for being great stories, very cinematic, so much so that I feel they will make for the best film adaptations. But, the last two were more in need of the sort of editing that writers lose do to the sheer magnitude of their celebrity. Half-Blood Prince is well edited and well-constructed, at a mere 652 pages, even the multiple trips down memory lane via the Pensieve, are nicely packaged. J.K. Rowling is a wonderful storyteller; the novel's finale is as agonizing as earlier pages are touching.As always Rowling has placed enough clues, for fans or readers familiar with classic archetypes, to predict the climax. Also, chapter one "The Other Minister" has one of the best devices for speedy exposition I've ever seen. It smoothly initiates new readers as the muggle Minister reflects. In years to come, this book will be "a sign of the post-911 times" The mood progressively darker, while the characters still continue to grow, Harry and company, more than not, sound like 16 year olds. Their relationships to others and one another continue to grow more complex. It is this change from book to book that makes Rowling's work unlike any other series, any genre.

When a SEVEN HUNDRED and THIRTY-FOUR page novel goes to the big screen, you can expect some EDITS, and very likely that some of your favorite moments from the book will be lost due to time, script, and budget constraints. During the planning stages there was talk of "Goblet" being so true to the text, that it might be released as a two-part movie (like "Kill Bill"). But, after "Prisoner of Azkaban" was so neatly "ABRIDGED" for screen, the idea was later dropped for the one-shot version. Most avid readers understand what to expect when attending a film version of a beloved book, it can never be the same experience that was had during their reading. The best a reader can hope for is that the director's vision is compatible with his or her own. For example, I always kind of see Peter O'Toole as Prof. Dumbledore when I read "the series," but I have NO complaints about either screen portrayals. So with the understanding that we are going to see a film BASED on a book, however closely or loosely adapted, we go to see a vision other than our own, sometimes it's a VISION other than the author's own.Director Mike Newell's vision of Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is as DARK and DANGEROUS as the novel itself earning WB its first PG-13 rating in the history of the HP film franchise. As the movie teasers tout "EVERYTHING CHANGES," Harry, Hermione and Ron change in their relationships towards the opposite sex and each other. Ron and Harry have a falling out, Ron is hurt by Hermione's attention toward Viktor Krum, Harry is stepping into manhood with ever increasing burdens being placed upon his shoulders, he is inexplicably entered into the Triwizard Tournament leading to life-or-death struggle with Lord VOLDEM*RT. Let's not forget Harry's greatest challenge to date: THE WINTER FORMAL!!! a.k.a. THE YULE BALL!! It gives me goose bumps just typing it.The novel contains some ready-made MOVIE MOMENTS, that is to say moments with tremendous potential for stunning visuals, like: the Triwizard Tournament, not to mention the film opener, the Quidditch World Cup (which had so much visual potential that it became a video game before the third movie was finished.) But, the Triwizard Tournament provides a neat bookshelf for the story, making this fourth addition to the franchise a much smoother endeavor than the previous releases. The young wizards, including Harry, must undertake 3 challenges or "tasks" throughout the school year.The first task involves Tournament participants or champions get a golden egg from a Dragon's nest, naturally this evolves into an aerial scene, which like Quidditch, proves difficult to affect the prefect balance of special effects to "make the magic work." Add to this already cumbersome technical task, the creation of a flying, fire breathing dragon, and even the boldest of writers and directors might flinch. But, not to worry, as you can tell from seeing the trailers alone, THIS SCENE IS BRILLANT!!Another scene I knew would be a "magical" movie moment was the "second task," which takes place underwater. Underwater scenes, especially in the sci-fi, fantasy genres are notoriously expensive and difficult to make, so I was pleased to see Harry's rescue included. And, there was "no way out" of the maze scene, which leads directly to Harry's confrontation with the "real" HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED.A note on the casting: Ralph Fiennes plays the restored Lord VOLDEM*RT, let me say its about time! Although, I wanted Fiennes to play Prof. Lupin, but muggles can't be choosers. But, Fiennes' portrayal of the "Dark Lord" is frightening to say the least. The imposing, Ahab-like Prof. "Mad-eye" Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is played with distinction by Brendan Gleeson (but, why not Patrick Stuart or David Warner?) Another bit of good casting is Stanislav Ianevski, no that's not a new character it's the Bulgarian actor who plays Hermione's Bulgarian Beau Viktor Krum.The other champions are also fair choices and Michael Gambon has grown on me as Dumbledore.On music, I must admit to feeling some disappointment at knowledge of JOHN WILLIAMS absence as composer. But, I am glad to report, that some of Williams' style and themes are still apparent in the work of replacement composer Patrick Doyle. Also, Yule Ball songs are provided by the Weird Sisters care of: Jarvis Cocker of PULP and members of RadioHead.Although a lot of the original scenes and dialog are "trimmed," like SIRIUS' scenes, for instance, which are reduced, the poor HOUSE-ELVES (Hermione would be outraged by the injustice of it!). Still, the overall mood of the novel is captured. It is captured so well that the film merits a PG-13 rating for frightening images, an implied murder, and the death of a major character. But one bonus of the trimmed down version of the book: there's NO TIME FOR THE DURSLEYS!!!The Warner Bros. film versions of the Potter series has given its audience the unique opportunity to watch the characters grow up, literally, an opportunity that would have been lost had producers lost their nerve and spread the movies out even more and gone with recasting. I for one am thankful that we have been allowed to continue this journey with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint and the other Weasleys (Wow! Who'd thought that "the twins" could get taller?).Goblet is without a doubt THE BEST FILM so far IN THE SERIES!Bring on book 5!One problem I have with the DVD is the split-up of the extras this time, so than you must pay extra for the 2-disc set.

In the same way that Americans shouldn't do English drama, the British should never attempt to do Westerns! The Gunfighters is a brillantly bad story with 1st Doctor and a must have for the more than causual screener of the series. This is awesome in the same Christmas plays are .... ( for a practical example see the Nativity Lobster in "Love Actually" ). The sets, costumes and dialog are all of the hook funny... and the British takes on the Arizona old west Dialect most be seen and heard to be believed! The Doctor and his companions turn up in Tombstone following a run in with the Celestral Toymaker, who got the last laugh on our favorite Timelord via some hard candy. The Doctor is in need of a good dentist, and the nearest one happens to be Doc Holliday... Mistaken identity and hilarity ensues.

The Doctor and crew arrive on Earth to discover that another time-traveler is altering history......If you described the events that unfold in the Meddling Monk story you might think we were referencing the 2005 series and HAROLD SAXON story arc, not a 1965 episode, because up til this point the the shows history we take for granted that the Doctor & the TARDIS are unique...maybe the "last of his kind" even. So although, the Meddling Monk story takes place during a shaky time for the series, what with it's lead character appearing less and less due to the failing health of William Hartnell, and his companions taking on more and more of the series focus. Resulting in Steven and Vicki spending practically all four parts trying to find the Doctor, while the Doctor himself, gets captured, escapes and then recaptured. But, this awkwardness can't diminish the importance of this monumental milestone in Doctor Who history: It is the first time that the viewer is introduced to another person who is a member of the Doctor's own race. Althought the Timelords still remain unidentified until Wargames (And not long in the series history, before another milestone is reached....the Doctor's ability to regenerate, which follows a short 2 story after this one). Another first for the series that occurs here is the departure from the straight historical story. So far whenever the Doctor has been in the past it has remained true to the history books but, here before long we see the Doctor find not only anachronistic objects (a wrist watch, record player playing monastery sfx, toaster and electric lamp) belonging to the Monk, his "meddling" actions bent on altering 11th century history for his own purposes, but an alien craft other than his own and another time-traveler. As obvious as it seems, this was a "NEW" twist on the shows time-travel theme. Can history be altered now?As I said companions Steven and Vicki take center stage for much of this story, proving themselves interesting characters even when not fielding dialogue for the Doc. Steven, in his first full story, having come on board the TARDIS as a stowaway at the end of THE CHASE, takes the opportunity to pick the Doctor & Vick's brains a bit about the abilities of the TARDIS, giving viewer the chance to hear more concepts and details not heard since the pilot. The Monk played by Peter Butterworth also proves an excellent addition to the show in the sole appearance as an interesting character never to return to the TV series, but perhaps inspiration for the Master character to come. Although, there is much debate among fans has taken place over the year for and against the likelihood that pair of rogue Timelords are in fact one in the same. But, common reasons against are as follows: The Doctor says that he is "50 years earlier" suggesting he left Gallifrey 50 years before the Monk did and that they have never met before. There are many references that the Master and the Doctor were contemporaries; he and the Monk are not. Also the M.O. of the Monk is dissimilar, unlike the Master, the Monk isn't interested in creating chaos or even world domination, he IS motivated by self-interest in manipulating time to his advantage, like his examples: He claims to have put 200 pounds in a bank account in 1968, and then collected a fortune in interest 200 years later. He also admits to helping the ancient Britons build Stonehenge using an anti-gravity lifter. The Monk is a character you almost can't help, but like, his wicked sense of humor...laughing at the Doctor trapped like a mouse, brings out a similar wickedness in the Doctor...as seen when the Doctor holds the Monk at er..."gunpoint." Unlike, the Master, you don't get the sense that the Doctor holds him as any kind of a real threat...he even says as much himself.The Monk's plan is to save Harold's army from having to attack the Vikings by destroying the fleet with a bazooka-weapon-of-sorts, allowing King Harold to face the forces of William of Normandy with a fresh army at the Battle of Hastings thus, ensuring that William is defeated at Hastings and thus bringing a period of peace to Europe. With the Monk's help, he hopes that the British will have jet propelled airliners by 1320 .....interesting that, HAROLD and the SAXONs and the Doctor learning that he isn't alone, while another of his kind prepares to alter the future of mankind....this all seems so familiar but I can't put my drumming fingers on in (drum-drum-drum...drum-drum-drum...drum-drum-drum...)Here are some GREAT LINES from the story!...The Doctor giving Steven the Tour of the TARDIS..."That is the dematerialisation control, and that over yonder is the horizontal hold. Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that is a chair with a panda on it... Sheer poetry, dear boy! Now please stop bothering me!" Genus!!Later when the Monk explains his plans for excellerating history and that by the 14th century Hamlet will premiere on television ...the Doctor says..."I do know the medium."

The 1981 Clash of the Titans was/still is a campy yet visually stunning fantasy classic. Campy? You ask? How could it not be, the Myths and archetypes by very definition are larger than life, so it stands to reason that the remake is going to have some camp to it, as well. And it does, but it doesn't disappoint as a popcorn picture, there the remake, like the original delivers. The original has the lovely Harry Hamlin, seriously, Perseus is prettier than Princess of Argos Andromeda. In the remake, up-and-comer Sam Worthington (Terminator 4, Avator) plays Perseus and has even less to do with the Princess than in the original, but he sure ain't no pretty-boy, and the new Andromeda is pretty, but Perseus is matched with the cursed and hauntingly attractive IO, this time round. Worthington's Perseus is even more of a reluctant hero than Hamlin, playing the everyman, a fisherman who has his great destiny thrust upon him. We get more of a glimse of his back story this time, including the flashback to Zeus' seduction of Perseus' mother and another origin for Calibos tied to the bastard demi-god's birth (instead of the cursed son of goddess Thetis. Not from any real Greek myth, It has been said that Calibos was based on Caliban from "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare.)The story is pretty similar to both the original and the myth; Perseus' re-gifted winged sandals still don't make it to the film's finale. The Mortals feeling as if they have been abandoned declare war on the gods, Hades leads the retaliation upon mankind in an attempt to seize power and usurp his brother Zeus. Perseus' adopted family is killed as Perseus swears vengeance Lord of the Underworld. Prideful Queen Cassiopeia again compares her daughter's beauty to that of the gods, to make amends Andromeda must be sacrificed or the whole city will be lost. Son of Zeus Perseus ends up on a quest to save Argos (and the lovely Andromeda ) from the punishment of the Kraken, collecting gifts and companions along the way, like some sword & sandals Magnificent Seven. Unlike the original, this film better captures the sense of scale between the gods and their strife with their less loyal subjects. It feels less like the Argons are the sole mortal effected. The bar for the gods is naturally raised, impressive transmutations and grand entrances and appearances, an homage to the clay figures of the original, only vaster.Although there are no Knights or Dames, the casting for the 2010 film is as impressively close to overkill as the original with egos such as Liam Neeson as Zeus (Olivier in '81), Ralph Fiennes a.k.a. Lord Voldemort is a perfect fit for Hades (omitted from the original). As I said Worthington replaces Harry Hamlin as Perseus, the lovely French actress Alexa Davalo as Andromeda (for Judi Bowker), Gemma Arterto( soon to be seen in Prince of Persia) plays Io, who befriends Perseus in a much sexier way that Bergus Meridth's character. Luke Evans has a couple lines as the "prettier than Harry Hamlin"other son of Zeus, APOLLO ( ironicly enough Evans will BE playing Zeus in 2011's Dawn of War). A number of models are cast, well, to look pretty; for example Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova gets her turn as a much lovelier more sympatric Medusa than you would expect, and English beauty Agyness Deyn stands as little more than Olympus window-dressing as Aphrodite. Speaking of pretty, the movie was filmed mostly on location in the Canary Islands, and cinematography makes full use of the lush Greekish scenery .The Great Ray Harryhausen (Jason & the Argonauts), stop-motion genius behind all of the mythological critters of the '81 original initially questioned the need for a remake...but approved of the effects of this one. The homage to his brilliant serpent-bodied Medusa is apparent, as is the return of the the giant scorpions, the Pegasus, Calibos and not to mention the over-the-top sea-monstery goodness of the Kraken for the climax. Speaking of homages, Bebo cameo at the half-hour mark. One new addition the Djinn, desert mages who extend their immortally by replace their flesh with "charwood and black magic," appearing as nightmarish treelike Middle-Earth figures with glowing blue eyes and wicked teeth. The visuals are pleasing, but the movie was retrofitted with the 3-D effect, so it has it's moments, but isn't super, but the directing style of Louis Leterrier (Hulk) lends itself to the techniques used for the process.Best not to think of this as a re-make, but a Spring Break distraction, for which it serves it's purpose...I expect the Kraken will soon topple the Dragons & their trainers from the box office weeklys.

We were looking for a substitute of the likes of the Video Now or some the other mindless electronic toys on the X-Mas must-have lists. It isn't much cheaper than those others, but we felt that the options for creativity were greater with the PIXTER.Like the other systems there are built-in functions: a tetris-like game, a drawing page, word games, dot-to-dot pages, and more. The stylus tool is fairly easy to use and the drawing functions have many stamps, backgrounds and other methods to enhance artwork. The PIXTER will save selected works, also there are many accessories to extend PIXTER interest, additional cartridges some with licensed products like Sponge-Bob, Barbie, Walking with Dinosaurs, Teen Titans, each allowing real-time clips and editing of TV scenes ($20 each). One of the most interesting accessories is the digital camera for even more personalized creative play.My 8 and 5 year old were hooked by the PIXTER. The only problem is the batteries, some systems come with chargers or AC ports, the PIXTER DOES NOT. We bought rechargable AAs for the toy.

It is an amazing animated series created by Genndy Trakovsky and the team responsble for STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS, both premiered in August of 2001 on the Cartoon Network. Samurai Jack's highly detailed, outline-free, masking-based animation style and its cinematic pacing, is unusual for today's cartoons. For example, the story is often stopped to allow for the building of tension before combat or for humor's sake, and it is not unusual for episodes to be almost free of dialogue. While the battle scenes in the series are reminiscent of samurai films they populate Jack's future setting with a variety of robot enemies providing censorship loophole, since the fallen "bleed" only oil. Also the music is so integral and powerful it could carry the story without any of the beautiful graphics.Featuring the voice work and the incredible depth of feeling from Phil LaMarr as Jack, and brilliance of Mako as Aku.If you don't know JACK...SAMURAI JACK, that is, is the story of a young samurai warrior seeks to defeat the evil shape-shifting master of darkness, Aku who has destroyed his father's kingdom and imprisoned its people.

Called "Samurai Jack" by the inhabitants of this future world, he seeks a way to return to the past and undo Aku's horrible deeds while battling Aku and his evil minions. This story is revealed in the first 3 episodes which form a superb trilogy, previously released as "SAMURAI JACKS: THE PREMIERE MOVIE."This set includes the previously released first 26 episodes, with the addition of episodes 27 through 39 as released in the season 3 set fromMay '06. Notable for 2 part "The Birth of Evil" revealing AKU's origin in the only story without Jack.FANS of the "Anglo-Anime" hybrid style created by the Samurai Jack team, WILL LOVE THIS SERIES! This is great set if you don't already own the season individually, until season 4 comes out in 2007. HIGH FIVE.

My daughters, who are new converts to the cult of Bob, lost interest in this assessory to the excellent PIXTER system. Most of the assessories, and the system itself offers multiple play options and a variety of play, just NOT THIS ONE. S-Bob, allows you to play bits in real-time video from a number of TV episodes and it allows for the shuffling/editing of random scenes, but not much else. I'd suggest getting one of the other PIXTER assessories instead.

This is a nice companion to the ATHF Movie with some original character links. The best tracks are definately better for the visuals like the film's opening listed on the CD as track 2 & 3. The retro refreshment song "Groovy Time For A Movie Time" by the Soda Dog Refreshment Squad, juxaposes the "evil snacks" with their "Cut You Up With A Linoleum Knife" by Mastodon. OMG, make sure u get to the theater on time for that opening! The animation and subtitles revealing the awesome lyrics is ultimately essential for the punchline of the joke. Maybe an enhanced CD with video would have worked better.Some tracks don't need a clear set up like Shake's NUDE LOVE, M.C. CHRIS' I WANT CANDY and CARL'S THEME. Also the character links (Meatwad, Carl, Shake, etc.) are okay set ups to some of the less connected tracks.Still, it is Aqua Teen Hunger Force and currently under $10 bucks,so I say see the movie - then pick this up - probably in that order.

In "War Of The Worlds" (2005) Tom Cruise is believable enough as the protagonist, this time with a name (Ray Ferrier) and estranged children (as a rule in Spielberg's films the children are infinitely more believable than the adults, Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin are no exceptions to this rule). ILM's visuals are chilling and stunning, from the subtle, to the not so subtle, they sell this movie: "Martian Tri-Pods, their death rays, and their pilots" the SFX are as brilliant as you will see this summer. Steven Spielberg's directing is on the money, as always, even Cruise has some genuinely moving performances, but the overall mood the film is hopeless, helpless and as dark as the original material. This maybe the films only fault, at least for American audiences accustomed to a more formulaic "blockbuster." The intensity of the film may overcome this hurdle, leaving audiences little time to breath, even the films introduction to Cruise's deadbeat dad is remarkable short before events begin to rapidly unfold. Some haunting and terrifying images will stay with audiences like: the flaming passenger train speeding by the awestruck refugees, ash and clothing in the aftermath of death rays, and the "red weed." The screenplay by Koepp and Friedman, based on H.G. Wells' novel, finds man as great a monster as any invader (as seen in initial evacuation scenes). John Williams, who composes music of such genius so effortlessly that his work is often taken for granted (proven time and time again by his disproportionate number of Oscar noms to wins) here he matches the films frantic pacing with perfection. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn are topnotch. Film buffs should watch for an homage or two including an iconic ET prop. This is no Independence Day, in spite of its synchronization with the holiday, but it is a great summer release closer to Spielberg's work of old.

Finally Thames Television's The Tomorrow People, the science fiction series that upon airing on NICK (belatedly in the early 80's), immediately hooked American audiences having discovered Tom Baker's Dr. Who. Like the BBC's popular sci-fi series The Tomorrow People followed a similar cliffhanger formula the show's first two seasons make their dvd debut in this four-disc set. The effects are quite dated but the premise remains sound: Average teen Stephen Jameson (Peter Vaughn-Clarke) learns he isn't so average when he meets the Tomorrow People" other teen with the powers he shares. The pilot "Slaves of Jedikiah" features Stephen's "breakout" or the extreme panic and shock that "Tomorrow People" undergo when becoming aware of the new powers, like hear others thoughts through telepathic contact (the other more experienced teens feel that transmitting the panicked teens name over and over into his head will have a claming effect as they attempt to aid Stephen's transition into the next stage of human evolution. The Tomorrow People are Homo superiors and as such are part of the galactic community, which is nurturing the Earth's first telepaths through a policy of strict non-interference. The teens travel by teleportation or jaunting, living with a super space computer in an underground hideout (because the normal Homo Sapiens, or an the TPs affectionately call them "SAPS," would fear or destroy them). They are unable to kill, even to defend themselves, this limitation make the series more family accessible, for the teens must use their brains to figure out non-violent solutions to their conflicts, sometimes pointlessly over elaborate, but non-violent none-the-less. They search the Earth (and time and space) to aid others emerging in this next step in human evolution.This 26 episode set including the first and second season has a cast commentary with Stars Nicholas Young, Peter Vaughn-Clarke, and Sammie Winmill on the first story arc, but no other notable extras.

a GREAT way to relive the 80's without all that hairgel. The scaled-down look of the ATARI 2600, the godfather of the home play systems, is reproduced without all the dusty cartridges. The Flashback includes 40 classic Atari games (and others from Activision) with gameplay on the original joystick design and the original game variations and difficulty settings. Games like Battle zone, Combat, Outlaw, Adventure, Pitfall, River raid, Lunar lander, Missile command, Yar's Revenge and Return. I was pleased with the Flashback on most points,having lost my original 2600 in Katrina, but was disappointed by the absence of a few favorites of mine like: Night Driver and Warlords. I also would have liked a paddle variation for the set. Speaking of paddles, Flashback II. included Pong, but ours didn't work right.Warning: Do not to confuse this system with Atari FlashBack (no Roman numeral) which has the 2nd gen. controlers and less games (it retails for under $20.)

Pixar's animation studio has not only been the go-to studio to continuely raise the bar for CG animation, but PIXAR pretty much created the bar itself. One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing "The Incredibles" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning "Finding Nemo" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and "A Bug's Life" none at all. So now with "CARS" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's "Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're "Lightyears" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young "oh-too-full-of-himself rookie" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him through the race. This clich&#65533; is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry "TCG" as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar "good luck charm" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the "CAR TALK" brothers "Click & Clack" on board, they so needed to advice us not to "drive like my brother." Great!Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06. The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes.

The 2005 season of the new & improved Dr. Who, includes the Doctor's return to Earth, only to find that he's returned his companion, Rose, home 12 months late! And there's this whole invasion of Earth thing going on too. Super effects worthy of a theater release, like a spaceship clipping Big Ben and landing in the Thames! Also a nice mix of CGI and live-action FX.Included on this set, the return of the Daleks, or the last remaining Dalek, trapped on Earth in a wealthy alien collector's underground bunker.In this amazing revamping of the Daleks, little is changed, but the fear-factor of those pepper-shaking dudes goes off the chart!!

Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). During March and through June the BBC celebrated by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodess for the 2005 rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers, clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any "new" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.This set includes BOOM TOWN in which the Doctor, Rose, Capt. Jack and Mickey team up to stop Margaret, the sole survivor of the Slitheen family (from World War III and Aliens of London.This was filmed as a cost-cutting "bottle episode" but has some great writing in it, as consequences of the Doctor's actions are explored... what happens after the action, when the Doctor must dirty his hands with the possible execution of a defeated foe.In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features "Big Brother," & "Weakest link" gags as the Doctor becomes a "flatmate" and Rose a contestant. Also features the "Final Battle" of the "Time War," the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!AWARDS:The 2005 series won the 2006 BROADCAST AWARD for BEST DRAMA SERIES adding to the series' successes at the National Television Awards (voted Most Popular Drama), TV Moments, and the BBC 2005 Drama Awards! The show's two stars (Eccleston and Piper) scooped the most popular actor and actress honors in the awards voted by the public. Dr. Who (2005)was also nominated for not only the 2006 HUGO Award (announcing winners on Aug 26), but on May 7th it WON 5 of the most prestigious award British Television has to offer: the BAFTAS Awards (British Academy of FILM and TELEVISION ARTS) out of the 14 categories it was nominated. Winning for BEST DRAMA SERIES, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST MAKE-UP, BEST COSTUME, BEST DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and the PIONEER AUDIENCE AWARD which was voted for by the British public (kind of like the US People's Choice Award).

I wondered how the BBC would handle their 4.5 season of specials...this. The one-shot new companion nature of the Dr. Who specials lends it self to this single story DVD release. This "Easter Special" follows the 2008 X-Mas special "The Next Doctor" leading us up to the END for the !0th Doctor as played by David Tennant....some reference is made to this in the final moments of Planet of the Dead with some foreshadowing similar to the Planet of the OOD line about the Doctor's song coming to an End (but not before the October special and Xmas 2009).Planet of the Dead is a pretty good special with some lovely cinematography and great location in the Dubai desert , some retro-aliens. The Doctor and a bus load of characters make an unscheduled stop on a desert planet . Characters like "sassy" wealthy adventurer/thief Lady Christina de Souza a'la Laura Kroft as played by the lovely Michelle Ryan (Merlin, the Bionic Woman, Jekyll) are likely to become fan favorites. Ryan, contrary to internet buzz, never auditioned to replace Billie Piper's Rose in '06, but after seeing the end product I think you'll agree she'd make a terrific season 5 or 6 addition to the cast.Enough filibustering for Ryan, the cast was great including Mousehunt's Lee Evans who superbly plays UNIT's technical support and parody of fandom....oh yeah did I mention UNIT gives fire support as always.Extras....Backstory is outlined in the consistently good behind-the-scenes series "Dr. Who Confidential." This features the making of the special was even better the actual end product...how the double-decker bus of shipped out of country, the stunts, disasters endured and of course effects.

It always makes me nervous when a film is promoted with: FROM THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU..... or IF YOU LIKED .... YOU'LL LOVE ....In this case it is fair to let the viewer know that they can expect the same quality adaptation of the award-winning book as HOLES, BECAUSE of WINN DIXIE, and CHRONICLES of NARNIA. Hoot, like these films, is very true to the spirit of the Carl Hiaasen text and like those films is an excellent movie to see even without having read the books (if you choose THAT strange path.)"EVERYBODY in AMERICA WANTS TO LIVE IN FLORIDA...EVERYBODY BUT ME," says Roy Eberhard, a 14 year-old who's moved around too much, this time leaving Montana thanks to his dad's job transfer. Roy (played well by Logan Lerman) is the new kid-- in humid fictitious Coconut Grove, Florida. But it's still the same routine: by himself at lunch, no friends, and thick-head, thick-necked bullies pushing him around. But if not for the bully mashing his face against the school bus window that one day, he might never have seen the barefoot running boy, who only goes by the handle "Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) a blond streak, faster than anybody. And if he had never seen the running boy, he might never have met bully-beating Beatrice (played by Brie Larson). And if he had never met Beatrice, he might never have discovered the burrowing owls living in a nearby lot. And if not for the owls, he probably would have missed out quite an adventure. Hoot is the story of an ecological mystery, with a Florida setting and pro-environment, anti-development message made up of endangered miniature owls, heartless developers scheduled to be built over their burrows, and the owls' unlikely allies--three middle school kids determined to beat the system, getting grown-up attention and save some owls.TV Director Wil Shriner (Frasier) keeps Hiaasen's tougue in cheek story funny and loose, thanks in part to Tim Blake Nelson as the contractor and Luke Wilson is at his dimmest as the inept cop. The films finale is predictable enough, but that is what make tweens' tales so popular in the first place. You KNOW the GOOD GUYS ARE GOING TO WIN...YOU KNOW the oh-so-cute owls will be saved...and that's ok."Hoot" produced by Frank Marshall and Jimmy Buffett for Walden Media, Buffett also provides excellent original music for the film, along with a role as the surfing marine biology teacher.Buffett's love for the region makes him a natural choice for Hoot's material. Overall the film shares a conservation message and reminds kids that they can make a difference. It's sure to be a hoot...I mean hit.

This book 2 of the GURPS basic set (4TH EDITION) The last edition was a single book of 256 pages plus instant characters section, but so much material was add to the new edition it would have weighed in at a total of 576 pages, while suitable for stoping bullets, a but unwieldy for gameplay, so Steve Jackson games have divided everything a player has to have is in book one, basic system rules and everything for character creation, just enough combat to get a player into the game. The rest of combat is this book. This book goes into detail for what a GameMaster needs to know about physical feats and combat (in greater detail). It covers vehicles and technology. It includes stats for animals and some monsters, along with a guide for world design and Game Mastering itself. "Tool kit chapters let the GM make artifacts, character abilities, and entire game worlds (in fact an infinity of worlds, alternate, parallel, cross-genre, etc.) Don't get me wrong this is just for GMs. Players who enjoy detail and the creative side of the game will find this book inspiration for beginning their own campaigns. My point is it's not required, but Basic Set GURPS: Characters and Campaigns are designed to work together, pages and chapters are consecutively numbered and the index covers both books and repeated in both. SJ games has made the system easy to play, easy to learn and easy to get hooked. They have also made the new Basic Set easier to carry around. GURPS stands for Generic Universal Role Playing System and it is just that, it is the perfect for linking already existing d20 systems, creating cross-genre campaigns or making campaigns based on any book, movie, TV series or concept you or SJ Games can brainstorm (before the Wizards of the Coast edition we used GURPS to run Star Wars and Dr. Who campaigns).www.sjgames.com/e23/ is an excellent resource for pre-generated PDS ranging from short adventures to whole sourcebooks. Like D&D;, there is a considerable amount of GURPS material out there, either new and updated or old and out-of-print, anything you can imagine (Fantasy, the Prisoner, Horror, Swashbuckler, and loads of other supplements). The GURPS main web site is good too, www.sjgames.com/gurps/ most books and supplements hotlink from Amazon.

This set includes the first 4 Potter games for PC: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Quidditch World Cup. This is a cool deal! This set cost less than more stores sell Prisoner of Azkaban alone. The Games (1-3) are model closely after the stories including much that the movies skip or alter. Like tje Hagrid's gift of a flute in Sorcerer's Stone. They also include Peeves the Poltergeist. The Hogwarts Castle is styled after the film and the books and a great deal of effort went into capturing the feel of the famous school of witchcraft and wizardry. It is loaded with secret passages, candy and wizard cards. The graphic are pretty good (on all platforms) and the actors used create their own interpretation of the chief characters. Game 3, Prisoner of Azkaban is much more in the spirit of the movies rather than the books, the faces of the characters more closely resemble their Warner Brother counterparts, and the Hogwart's students wear school uniforms (instead of robes with crests over street clothes). This isn't a complaint, either way. I enjoyed both versions of the series.The fourth game in this set:The Quidditch World Cup is not an adventure game, but a sports game, using elements from basketball, soccer and football to recreate Quidditch game play more elaborately than in the other 3 games. THIS GAME WAS NOT BASED ON THE NEWLY RELEASED MOVIE, but came out based solely on the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.You can play proffessional Quidditch play for the World Cup as a team in the Quidditch League using players like Krum, playing the country of your choice (including playing for the States). This leads me to my one complaint: YOU CAN'T PLAY IRELAND. You can't play as, or against Ireland's Quidditch team. But, QWC is still the best game of the set.If don't want to play in the league for the World Cup, there is also the option of Hogwarts house play.All 4 games come in a single-4 disc jewel case, not individually packaged within the 12" box.

As you have heard the interactive controls are the best thing about the new Wii, that and the fact that it is the cheapest platform out there.Games like Sports (free with system) and Wii Play are worth owning the system for alone. The boxing training segments can be quite a workout!The system is compatable with the old cube games (although you must use game cube memory cards for them rather than the Wii cards. Another bonus is the wireless internet options allowing for downloads of classic games and more add-ons appear from day-to-day. Future releases like the remake of Destroy All Monsters & talk of Star Wars combat games have me looking foward to spending more on Wii.One negative: Like it's competition, the games for the Wii are overpriced, but blockbuster is already renting them.

"Spearhead form Space" milestones not only the 3rd Doctor's first episode (following the forced regeneration of PATRICK TROUGHTON at the end of WAR GAMES), But the series' new direction, using color film stock and anchoring the series with UNIT setting and characters. The 3rd Doctor is more like a super-spy with para-military backup, whether he wants it or not.Stranded on EARTH by the TIMELORDS, the new Doctor, played by Jon Pertwee, along with his assistant/scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John) and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) investigate an unusual meteorite and its links with a sinister doll factory. This introduces the Autons and sets the pace for much of the decade yet to come. The Autons are cybernetic/alien killers a.k.a.-LIVING PLASTIC --and the sequence in which they break through shop windows to slaughter window shoppers remains a series first for truly crossing deeply into realm of the horror genre. Much of the first episode in the story has the Doctor in and out of consciousness, along with what appears to the hospital staff as an inexplicable, desire to find his "SHHHHOOES" followed by a brilliantly-hilarious wheelchair escape attempt.In spite of new cinematic look of the series, the horror dwindles following the introduction of a subplot involving a wax museum, and the FINAL BATTLE with the Nestine consciousness is "just plain silly," but vintage sci-fi nostalgia. Of course, the AUTONs return in "The Terror of the Autions" which is creeper than "SPEARHEAD" and introduces THE MASTER. But, the AUTONs return yet again in the first episode of the new DR. WHO (2005), in the episode entitled; ROSE. The 2005 edition also contains a disturbing re-work of the shop front breakout.Finally released in it's original episodic format, not in the awkward movie format from VHS or public TV - as the story was broadcast. The extras on this one are fun ones, like: a commentary by Nicholas Courtney and Caroline John, Production Notes (subtitle track), a UNIT recruitment film, a "Who's Who" biography section, and an Easter Egg.

I love this special....and I am torn whether or not I want to buy it again, while I struggle to replace all the DW I lost to Katrina ( I was converting to DVD anyway), but don't I already own this one on DVD...if this were Blue-Ray, I'd atleast be able to justify it...granted there are lots of extras I would like to see...but I not sure...but if u don't have it already...and I can't stress this enough..."YOU NEED THIS DVD!"If you are just learning your way around the Doctor Who universe this is a milestone for you, the 5th Doctor teaming up with his past selves, how cool is that...and surprisingly obvious, he is a timetraver, a long lived one at that, even with the whole universe at his disposal he must meet himself now and again. Well, according to the Doctor it only happens in the direst of times...with the Timelords help, as in the THREE DOCTORS.Here the Doctor is taken out of time at points in his LIVES, featuring oddly enough 3 original actors playing their respective Doctors, the First Doctor played here by another actor and the 4th Doctor is sparingly taken from the unaired Shada episode (by Douglas Adams). The Doctor is taken out of time to play the GAME OF RASSILON in the Timelord DEATH ZONE facing old enemies like THE CYBERMEN, THE DALEKS, YETI, THE MASTER, who is actually meant to be rescuing the Doctor. Also along for the ride lots of classic companions including the Doctor's first companion SUSAN "FOREMAN", fan fav SARAH JANE SMITH along with a K9 cameo, UNIT'S Finest the Brigadier , cameos by Jamie and Zoey (sort of). Tegan and Turlough are the 5th Doctor's current companions to they help out, but strangely absent is robot shape-shifter Kamelion, who isn't mentioned in the story, by timeline wise is in the TARDIS.The Doctors and their companions are split up each finding their own way to the Dark Tower at the center of the DEATHZONE games, ultimately leading to a showdown with their abducting benefactor who is no stranger either.The last DVD offered tweaked SFX options and several different edits have been offered of the Five Doctor's over the year, some more suspect then others, like the DVD deletion of the Cyberman's "AHHH" upon spotting the Doctor, which I greatly missed. The sometimes in, sometimes out "Cyber-barf" as well. Another change was the edited end effects of the TARDISes departure scene, which was removed, while making more sense in the latest edit, aren't nearly as cool.This release ties in nicely to the inclusion of TIME CRASH the brief 5th Doctor 10th Doctor team up to be included in the season 4th set.Drinking games for the Five Doctors:This one is simple...drink whenever there is a retro-reference from the show's past...this one loaded with 'em...for example:...baddies from the past, lots of 'em......companions from the past, lots of 'em.......quotes from the past "I'll explain someday..." or "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow!"...Susan strains an ankle!....Classic!

Foreign language(s) or not, "A Prophet" is easily a film worthy of Coppola or Scorsese... But even the Dons themselves might wince at the film's intensity and complexity. A Prophet" ( French: Un proph&egrave;te) is a 2009 French prison stylistically directed by Jacques Audiard generates icons & images for people who don't have any substantial presence on traditional screens, i.e. Arabs in France, or Corsicans for that.A Young Franco-Arab Malik El Djebena begins his six year prison sentence, possibly for assaulting an policeman. This is his first time an adult prison, he has no support in or out of prison and quickly falls in with the Corsicans who control what happens there. His hopes to serve his time in peace and without incident end as he learns of the division between Corsicans and Muslims. The sadistic head of the Corsican prison Mafia is C&eacute;sar Luciani, who strong-arms Malik into the Corsicans' activities, beginning with the murder of a Muslim inmate. In doing so Malik Solidifies his place as an outsider to both sides, the Corsicans, who still see Malik as a dirty Arab, and the Muslims who mistrust him because this cooperation, regardless of this North African blood...then things get complicated, suffice to say Malik begins a journey that eventually gains him allies, and a awarenessof his own heritage.The film is violent, unrelenting and complex, you may want to buy a program. Also, You may find as I did (certainly after you read this) that Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) looks like an Algerian Shia LeBeouf. But as Shia is Jewish/ Cajun there likely no relation. Anyway, the film was a nom for "Best Foreign Language Film" in 2010 Academy Awards.

It's good to see TRAVELER again, especially with GURPS (the Generic Univeral Role-Playing System) and STEVEN JACKSON GAMES behind it. If you're not familiar with TRAVELER, it is a space adventure RPG using lots of 6-sided dice. The system provides plenty of freedom to create your game world/galaxy in the space genre of your favorite movie/TV-show/novel or whatever. The GURPS system also lends itself in this respect, rarely limiting the character conception process with class restraints and such.Interstellar Wars is a good suppliment for players wanting a departure from the mainstream RPG play.

Season two begins where the first left off, and that's as straight as the continuity gets with flashbacks, false-starts, intro to the others along with some classic twists leading us all directions including a retelling of sorts of the pilot. Season 2 answers questions, while posing more. It reveals new "possible" regulars, while reworking old ones. Great!I really enjoyed my boxed set of the first season and I have been counting down until the release of this boxed set. The series really deserves to be watched in one or two marathons rather than shuffled network dates laced with reruns that distort the "confusing enough natural order" of the series.

I'm a long time fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in all their incarnations, so I've been ready for this new Movie tie-in. The last batch of TMNT games was extra-cool because they present the chance to play all 4 brothers along with 4 players. That is my ONLY complaint. You can play all the Turtles (and the Nightwatcher, Raphael's armored vigilante crime-fightin' persona)but unlike Wii's Marvel fare, have only the 1 player option.Still this is the best-looking Turtle game I've seen (any platform). In addition to the graphics, the game-play is good, loads of great fighting moves that work well with the unique controlers (you use the remote and the chuck for this one). Typical of the Wii system, you might find that you're getting a workout, while going for all the fighting moves. There are turtle-tag-team co-op moves too, like the Brother Throw & Super family attacks. Also look for the return of old favorites like Mike's Nunchuck Helicopter.If you take a beating and start to pass-out, wiggling the remote might clear your groggy mutant head. Another way to restore health is meditation.As this is based on the Prince of Persia engine, theres lots of wall-scaling, climbing impossibly up...this is the most vertical Turtles ever! THESE GUYS HAVE NEVER MOVED SO MUCH LIKE NINJAS...EVER!The story...all four Turtles have gone their separate ways: Leonardo completes his training in South America, Raphael fights in NYC as the Nightwatcher,Don and Mikey run COWABUNGA CARL, a party service for kids. Tension builds as the family reunite to find answers to monster appearances and a billionaire linked to the FOOT.Enemies you will fight are the Militia, Purple Dragons, the Foot( naturally), a group of tech junkies who own the sewers known as the Black Gators and other Movie-tie-in suprises.Completing levels in the game unlocks special challenges and the Wii version of TMNT has nine exclusive MINI-GAMES in which you go for the best times.

Yeah...sure it IS a cliche', but it's one of my favorite cliches and one I've wanted to see a Dr. Who slant on.The 9th Doctor and his current companion Rose Tyler accidently land on Justicia, prison camp consisting of over six planets. The pair are immediately locked up. The Doctor is trapped with the rest of the aliens in a scientific labour camp. While Rose is in with the human "bad girls" who immediately welcome her to the teen borstal.The two work against the odds to find one another and escape, but as the Doctor says, "You've got two hopes- BOB HOPE and NO hope."Writer Stephen Cole does a nice job of capturing the feel of the 900 year old, regenerating, time-traveling Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (the 2005 season of the 40 year old British sci-fi series). Fans of the show will enjoy this original Dr. Who adventure which is similar to the style of the old Target books episode-by-episode TV tie-ins. These have more dynamic plots and lovely HARD-BACK editions. Given the 9th Doctor's short 13 episode run, I look forward to stretching out his "time-line" by reading A bunch more of these.

The original classic mutant-teens are back, the new series is great, but it's great to see these "still very watchable" toons, My 4 and 8 year-old (DAUGHTERS!) enjoy and ask to see these as a companion to the 21st cen. Counterparts. The FOX series just hit 100 episodes, combined with the original 193, TMNTs will be at 300+ before the end of the year. CONGRATs boys!Don't be fooled by the VOLUME "4" This volume is continuing (not yet completing) the 35 episode season THREE, running September of 1989 to July 1990, their last season as a strictly syndicated series before CBS, picked them up for the remainder of their 10 years on air. The THIRD vol. contained the first 12 episodes of that season, VOL. 4 contains the next 12.Notable stories from this season containing the introductions of two major characters recognizable from the 2000s: CASEY JONES (episode 39) and LEATHERHEAD (episode 41). In these earlier incarnations these character's are less like their FOX or their Mirage comicbook selves, but are still a pleasure to watch. Unfortunately this volume just missed including USAGI YOJIMBO (episode 43)Here's the running order:The Old SwitcherooAttack of the Big MACCCamera BuggedThe Four MusketurtlesTurtles at the Earth's CoreBeware the LotusTake Me to Your LeaderBlast from the PastCasey Jones - Outlaw HeroTurtles, Turtles EverywhereLeatherhead: Terror of the SwampCorporate Raiders from Dimension XNote: 5 stars series, but 3 for DVD extras.

Mysteries surround the work of one of the greatest artists of all time. Twilight chases, secret hiding places, and even a code help to solve the mystery. This could be a tagline for THE DaVINCI CODE, but it's an equally excellent story for 9-14 yr-old readers. CHASING VERMEER encourages readers to use all their creativity and problem-solving skills to unwrap a mystery connected to the elusive painter Johannes Vermeer.Calder and Petra are both intellectual outsiders, a little eccentric. Their curiosity and their quirky hobbies, eccentric families along with their creative classmates at the University of Chicago Lab School they're the prefect match for this mystery. Three enigmatic letters mailed to their neighborhood and seem linked to the theft of a famous Vermeer painting, a string of coincidences brings Calder and Petra together to help solve a crime that has baffled the world.Author Blue Balliett seems adapt at playing with puzzle solving & coincidences, a running theme through the novel, some feasible and others far-fetched. The novel, with its theft of a well-known painting, seeks to inspire young people to appreciate art as something relevant to their lives. This novel, like the sequel (THE WRIGHT 3, see my review), gets Children thinking about Vermeer, comparing, writing, and visiting museums with friends. Many readers, adults as well, will come to have a new appreciation for old paintings and their meaning. As an art teacher, I found Balliett's novels to be perfect for this, I've been happy to share my knowledge of art and art history with local mystery readers whose imaginations have been fired By the novel.CHASING VERMEER's outstanding illustrations infuse almost as much life into the book as the text does. Illustrator Brett Helquist (illustrator of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events) includes full-page chapter illustrations. Observant readers can use some drawings to uncover a secret. Also included are "After Words," containing a brief Q & A with the writer & the artist, "How to make your own pentominoes," "How I Draw by Brett Helquist," and "Ways of Seeing" a guick-guide to looking at art.CHASING VERMEER with its focus on connections and coincidences is reminiscent of HOLES, and its art-related mystery begins to mind FROM THE SECRET FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER. CHASING VERMEER deserves a spot alongside these well-loved children's books, really, it's that good.

This was the 2nd season opener and tied up loose ends from Timeflight, in which unhappy Aussie Air Hostess Tegan finally makes it back home (a.k.a the airport)an complains when the 5th Doctor actually leaves her.Arc of Infinity features many returns in addition to Tegan, it features the return of the TIMELORDS, absent from the series since Baker's Doctor returned home to claim the Presidency (ofcourse the Timelady Romana was with him for 2 1/2 seasons but this Time we get the homeworld again). Also returning, the mad lost architect of the Timelords, OMEGA, last defeated by the Doctor's first three incarnations simultaneously in the "Three Doctors." This return of the Timelords comes as a timely release following the events of the 3rd Season of the new series (watch for it). OMEGA last seen in the anti-matter universe, trapped a unliving paradox, his sacrifice giving the Doctor and the Timelords their power over time, space and death. This time the "Proto-Timelord's" plan again is to free himself using the Doctor. Ultimately, tragically he fails in a very sympathetic climax.Eventually, due to inexplicable coincidence, Tegan reunites with the TARDIS crew. ARC serves as a vehicle for Peter Davidson to play both the Doctor and the newly embodied OMEGA in Doctor form, which he does in what becomes the story's best moments. Before his transformation the new costume for OMEGA is also standout cool as are the location shots throughout the story.My one complaint is that the DVD would have made a nice set along with Timeflight instead of two singles.

With the 10th Doctor's reunion with companion Sarah Jane Smith and K-9 in 2006's "SCHOOL REUNION" Releasing Sarah's final adventure with the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker) as 1976's Hand of Fear ends with a touching and surprisingly warm departure as the Doctor and Sarah part company. It's no accident that the new series sought out her return, SJS, the plucky journalist portrayed by Elisabeth Sladen is one of the best-loved companions, leastwise before ROSE TYLER's appearance. First appearing as a women's libber in the 3rd Doctor's Time Warrior, in which she mistakes him for a malevolent traitor. SJS was introduced as a strong character that wasn't going to need the Doctor's rescuing, much like Rose, although invariably evolving into a character that needed the Doctor's rescuing anyway. Sarah's met the first 5 Doctor's in "The 5 Doctors," she's had a X-mas special with K-9 ( a Christmas present from the Doctor, K-9 & Company) and word is that a children's spin-off is now in the works for the pair.After the Doctor and Sarah Jane mistakenly land in a present-day (70's) quarry (an amusing location considering all the quarry filled alien worlds presented over the years) and the pair are caught up in an explosion. Sarah is rushed to hospital, clutching a stone hand . But when the hand possesses Sarah's mind, a chain reaction begins, resulting in a confrontation on the frozen planet of Kastria.This story arc is typical of Tom Baker's Doctor, the affection that the Doctor and Sarah have for one another really bring together the episode. Both over the top portrayals of the power-hungry and paranoid Eldrad are very memorable as are the mind-zapped catch-phrase "Eldrad must live!"FOR more SARAH JANE SMITH action checkout BIG FINISH AUDIO's radio-style further adventures of Sarah Jane Smith, check the UK Amazon.

"How Big is Big?...."The Masque of the Mandragora, Season opener for the Fourth Doctor was surprisingly low key. We begin with the Doctor and Sarah in a TARDIS corridor having a conversation about his "enormous boot cupboard."But as tame as the moment seems, it is one of the scenes I remember best from this story arc....up until this point very little of the TARDIS interior had been seen and here it is suggested how really huge it could be inside it's disguised form. Soon after this moment would be "called back to" in the chase through the TARDIS interior for "INVASION of TIME."Another great thing about Masque is that is was another Dr. Who story set in Earth's past following the Third Doctor's isolation to Earth's "present" with UNIT (and some galactic yo-yoing towards the end of his tenure) it is good to have the Doc travel for these historical adventures again. This time the Doctor and Sarah are on Earth during the Italian Renaissance when the corrupt and powerful Medicis rule, and to heap some more trouble on to that the Doctor inadvertently transports a Mandragora ball of energy and alien intelligence intent on conquering Earth.There's a great cast of plotting and political characters maneuvering their Machiavellian notions through this tale: Evil Uncle Frederico; a Count planning to usurp the rule of his nave, nephew; Giuliano, with the aid of his court astrologer Hieronymous, not to mention the evil brothers of the Cult of Demnos. As in much of the Classic episodes of Dr. Who, there are clear similarities to Classic Lit., this time it is POE's "Masque of the Red Death", with added twists ofcourse. This isn't a complaint, mind you.There's lots of horses, swords, wonderful costumes and wonderful dialogue, too. There's a running gag begun in this one in which the Doctor never gets to meet the great Leonardo DaVinci, I hope the new series picks up on this and does a story. Not to mention the open ending of this one...look out 1980's!!!Drinking Game:Drink when.......the Doctor and/or Sarah are knocked unconscious....the Doctor and/or Sarah are bound / gagged or arrested....the Doctor and/or Sarah talk down to the "eye-ties"....there is a case of mistaken identity before/ during or after the Masque....someone is ZAPPED with Helix Lightning (like the Doctor's Clint Eastwoodish stand-off)...you see a guy in tights (what the heck, go ahead)!

The last of the original series! Even though the makers were already in production when learning the show was to be the last. Thankfully Master meets the 7th Doctor played again by the late-great Anthony Ainley. "Survival" boasts a darker Doctor, facing a darker Master in the final battle with his evil Timelord nemisis (aleast until the Movie and ofcourse SEASON THREE of the new show!The Doctor takes ACE home to the old neighborhood and many of her friends have gone missing. The two investigate, ultimately endding up on an alien world fighting for their lives and slowly becoming like the savage Cat-people who hunt there and on Earth.A great show with some cool concepts and some funny animatronic moments. There is some great dialogue also, like the Doctor finishing the shopkeepers joke as a segue to the theme of survival of the fittest.As is the words between the Timelords as they nearly destroy one another.Drinking games for Survival. Drink whenever:1.) someone shifts worlds2.) a disturbingly fake cat hisses3.) a real cat appears4.) the man-cats break-into song5.) the Doctor says..."if we fight like animals we die like animals"6.) anyone runs inspite of advice to the contrary

A weak first episode for Sylvester Mcoy's run as the 7th Doctor. Due to the bad blood between Colin Baker and the BBC, this story begins with a quick regeneration instead of a more dignified exit for the 6th actor (Although Colin has a solid list of audio adventures to this very day many stronger than his last season). So 'Time & the Rani' opens with Mcoy prone and be-wigged for the regeneration sequence which is the worst in the show's 40+ history! Apparently the Doctor is regenerating due to a forced landing caused by the Rani, perhaps, making a return appearance without having to split screen time with the Master ( shame that, cuz the verbal sparing between the two in 'Mark of the Rani' made that weak story stronger). Anyway the pilot to mess with Time and Strange Matter unfolds, companion Mel is confused and there are cameos my Einstein and H.G. Wells helps out, too. The New theme and heavily Digital FX are a distraction, but there's a good Doctor portrayal fighting to emerge here... Did I mention the Chicken People?!Drinking Games-Drink whenever:...Mel is confused, screaming or unconcious ...well just drink whenever she's on screen....a Chicken-man or Woman is blown up....the Doctor changes costumes or identities, for that matter.....the Bat people zap out there tongues!...you see strange digital cheesiness (including the opening and closing of the show).

This is the Harry Potter version of the Scene-It DVD game containing 160 questions and a DVD with clips from the first three films and images and questions from the upcoming "Goblet of Fire." Like most DVD games it's overpriced, but this one will be dated very soon, as more films are released. The board and game pieces are ok, the cards are fine the 4 tolkens: the sorting hat, the Hogwarts Express, the Snitch, and Hedwig are well-made. Party play mode is fun for hands-free causal play. Most card questions are for the serious Potter fans only, some namely the questions about cast members and their other films are for the real Potter film buff. Until Warner Brothers finishes all 7 films, you might get more use out of the James Bond edition.

The chrome-like set for the MAGNETIX system is a construction activity based on combining steel balls and magnetic rods (these limited to the metal colored design), joined together to create whatever shapes and objects you can think up. The play is limited to which expansion set you have, the 70 pc. is an ok SET, but it lacks any structural aids like the wall shapes or the longer flexible attachments. I would also like to see some hint/idea books included in the sets, the only books that came with this set was offers for other expansion sets (which Do look neat, but still).All-in-all a fun time can be had with a couple of set variants. Some of the variants are hard to find like the "Glow-in-the-dark" set.System could easily transfer nicely to the classroom, for math and science projects building models. Having children construct square, triangle and other shapes or using MAGNETIC x-treme for more architecturally directed play linking and locking assembly connectors.Does contain small chrome parts that present a choking hazzard for children under-3 yrs.

Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). The BBC celebrated in 2005 by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodes from the rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.EXTRAS:SET features the companion series DR. WHO CONFIDENTIAL, a behind the scenes show that ran concurrently providing an episode for all 13 shows supplying fun chart toping tunes to film footage, interviews and more. Set also includes commentaries by cast and crew actually worth listening to!!Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any "new" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.The PILOT story: "ROSE" introduces his new companion Rose Tyler who is attacked by mannequins (or AUTONS) in the department store where she works. She meets the Doctor and the pair end up fighting to save the world. The pacing of this one, like most of the 13 new episodes, is like lightning, and the Autons have never been scarier. The TARDIS (interior) has never looked better or bigger.Next in "THE END of the WORLD" The Doctor offers Rose a chance to go anyplace, anytime, they end up 5 Billion years in the future above the Earth just before it ends. But someone has sabotaged the very observation satellite they're on. Not a bad episode, it shoots very high with a "Restaurant at the End of the Universe" motif and cinematically accomplishes it, also reveals that the Doctor is the "Last of the Timelords."In the episodes 4 & 5 "ALIENS of LONDON" & "WORLD WAR III." The Doctor takes Rose home (mistakenly) 12 months later. We FINALLY learn what happens back home when a companion up and leaves with the Doctor. The pair deal with Rose's Mum, who thought she was dead, and the ex-boyfriend who has been the main suspect. But when a spaceship crashes in the Thames in an "stunning" sequence which sets new standards for TV effects, the whole world goes on Red Alert, and the Doctor is noticed by the Government. Contains a nice mix of CGI and latex. Also features Toshiko Sato, returning character for Dr. Who spin-off TORCHWOOD due to broadcast for late '06.In Episode 6, "DALEK" Beneath the Salt Plains of Utah, the billionaire collector Henry Van Statten holds the last relic of an alien race and the one living exhibit in the museum is a....you know what. This one makes the Daleks scary (again)! One Dalek, outgunned, outnumbered, boy is mankind in trouble. This one was nominated for a 2006 HUGO Science Fiction Achievement Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form category (Battlestar Galactica won it last year for the episode "33")In episode 8, FATHER'S DAY, The Doctor takes Rose back in time to meet her long-dead Father, but the Tylers finds themselves battling the Reapers. A truly heart-wrenching episode, loads of disturbing imagery. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose is very real, in spite of the increasing unreality of the situation(a 2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION).In the 9th episode, THE EMPTY CHILD. Its London, 1941, the Blitz. A mysterious child terrorizes Homeless children in this 2 part storyline.The Empty Child story continues in The DOCTOR DANCES. The Child's plague is spreading throughout wartime London, and so is its zombie army. "TORCHWOOD's" main spin-off character Capt. Jack Harkness is introduced...ROSE: You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kindof freelancer.JACK: That's a little harsh- I prefer to think of myselfas a criminal.The "Empty Child" and "The Doctor Dances" maybe one of the greatest stories in the entire history Dr. Who.(2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION)In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features "Big Brother," & "Weakest link" gags as the Doctor becomes a "flatmate" and Rose a contestant. Also features the "Final Battle" of the "Time War," the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!AWARDS:The 2005 series won the 2006 BROADCAST AWARD for BEST DRAMA SERIES adding to the series' successes at the National Television Awards (voted Most Popular Drama), TV Moments, and the BBC 2005 Drama Awards! The show's two stars (Eccleston and Piper) scooped the most popular actor and actress honors in the awards voted by the public. Dr. Who (2005)was also nominated for not only the 2006 HUGO Award (announcing winners on Aug 26), but on May 7th it WON 5 of the most prestigious award British Television has to offer: the BAFTAS Awards (British Academy of FILM and TELEVISION ARTS) out of the 14 categories it was nominated. Winning for BEST DRAMA SERIES, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST MAKE-UP, BEST COSTUME, BEST DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and the PIONEER AUDIENCE AWARD which was voted for by the British public (kind of like the US People's Choice Award).WHEN it aired on SCI-FI FRIDAYS @8 PM CENTRAL there were some lines and moments cut from the original BBC versions, these are the complete episodes.Hopefully SCI-FI will pick up SEASON 2, starting with the post-regeneration CHRISTMAS INVASION because believe it or not the next 13 even better!!

Nearly 30 years ago we saw the rebirth of the 1938 character on screen, we had seen the black & white to color TV reruns, but until unknown Christopher Reeve flew to John Williams' music embodiment of the Superman, we believed that "a man could fly" like the tagline offered, and the film still holds up pretty well. But this "Return" after 1987's fourth and weakess offering is styled to continue the movie continuity (more post Superman II, than IV) with the original nearly invulnerable character with the same two weaknesses we all know and love: Kryptonite, of course, and those pesky human bonds, i.e. the people around him who can be used by his enemies as leverage, the very reason for his lame CK alter ego. Both of these weaknesses are exploited again and again in the films, this one too. These weaknesses are exploited by nemesis Lex Luthor, played in the spirit of Hackman's incarnation of the character here by the brilliant Kevin Spacey. This time his plan isn't any more original, just visually inspired, he plans to use Superman's Kryptonian tech to create "New Krypton" on Earth, with a Kryptonite twist. Luthor's philosophy is articulately outlined by an early scene with his latest groupie Kitty Kowaiski (Parker Posey) in which LL is asks if he considers himself a god, and he sees himself as Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to "share it" with mankind. I thought that this was a truly original view of Luthor's motivation for his hatred of Superman, not the old he's good and I'm bad, setup, but a genuine distain for this alien who's holding out on the human race.There was preproduction talk, about the same time the DaVinci Code was being scrutinized, about the messiah angle of SUPERMAN RETURNS; Jor-El sends his only son to Earth to lead through example, he returns to the heavens (search the remains of Krypton), his "second coming" back to Earth and towards the climax of the film he takes a "Passion"-like beating from Luthor's thugs looking on like Roman centurians. The original character concept has always been at least a demi-god, coming to terms with his human-half like Hercules, super-strong, part-god, part-man, his greatest weakness his hubris. Jewish immigrants themselves, the original creative team, before "Supes" did more than leap over tall buildings, probably saw him as the ultimate immigration success story, not for themselves they got little over 100 bucks and a 10 yr contract for the character, but Superman was embraced by the fictitious world the same as the real world. Director Bryan Singer explores the emotional impact of a world that has moved on without Superman, a concept probably more effectively done in the various Superman comic series over the years (he has left Earth for self imposed exiles on multiple occasions, not to mention his death in 1992). The film deals with the impact on those around both Clark Kent and Superman. Lois has had a kid (who was born shortly after Superman leaves Earth, hmm...), gotten an X-man fianc&eacute; and written a Pulitzer winning story "Why the World Doesn't Needs Superman." Sure there's loads of character exploration, that's what Singer excels at ( see Usual Suspects and X Men 1 &2), but there's also more action than you'll see anywhere else this summer, even without Richard Donner. The story could be better considering all the writers who didn't make the cut in the end (Kevin Smith, J.J. Abrams for starters). I wish they had broken away from the familiar, maybe dare I say it "left out Lex," maybe even used the "Death of Superman" storyline, including Doomsday and the "Reign of the Supermen." WB's Smallville has proved that the character can be successful without being constrained to canon. But this familiarity is surely a strength that makes the film feel like a long-over-due sequel. It's got the same, only darker, sense of humor as the originals. There's also an amusing anti-smoking gag that runs through the film (for example, a catatrophic sequence of events started by a cabbie's stogie, and Lois is hounded to quit by multiple parties).The art direction was bold, but while the suit pays homage to decades of design, it is careful not to stray to far (although the retro-reverse shield on the belt is a cool touch). Metropolis, is finally a real city now, not just a recycled New York, the Daily Planet looks great, and you just know that globe on top is gonna see some action from the opening. But as for FX, there are some milestones here, some crazy-good super-saves, I mean a bullet to the super-eye, awesome, New Krypton awesome, I wasn't sure they could top "Matrix" flight, or even "Smallville" limited airborne moments, but never has the rescue of a crashing plane been handled with better style, believable physics and sheer coolness!With Singer as big a fan as he is of the original films he should have tried get John Williams to handle the whole score instead of his X-staple John Ottman. But Ottman uses enough of Williams' Superman motiffs and themes to satisfy. And it's plenty better than the X3 music, yuck.On casting, the movies gotten loads of grief, partly because the part has turned over so much, but I agree with the need for a relative unknown, so you aren't distracted by a celebrity. Brandon Routh, fits the bill, he looks and sounds like Reeve, which was more the plan than getting Superman, I think. Spacey is so good in everything that he does his celebrity transcends any part he plays, Kate gives a lot of heart to the Lois character as does the great Frank Lanella playing editor Perry White. Using Brando footage as Jor-El is inspired as is the casting of Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent. Sam Huntington plays Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen well-enough (although the guy is almost never out shooting pics), while Superman's revial for Lois' affections are played believably by James Marsden as Richard White, who at one point in a "discussion" with Lois throws her previous story title "The Night I Spent With Superman" in her face. There's a nice love triangle, but it's not the traditional Clark/Lois/Superman. There's little chemistry between Brandon as Clark and Kate as Lois, but once she overcomes her abandonment issues with Superman he becomes a player in a triangle with Lois and Richard. But, he comes to terms with his role in their lives when he asks his competition during a rescue if "he's got them." By the end we realize, as does Clark, that the world still needs a savior and a Superman. I'm glad we've got one in Superman Returns.There are some nice twists that may or may not keep you guessing (especially at the end) but, it is a great flick. Also it has SPIDERMAN 3 PREVIEWS!

Not the Mamma!" That was Kevin Clash's who falsetto voice for Baby Sinclair ... Better known as Elmo! I new this series couldn't last. Dinosaurs was sort of the reverse Flintstones.A Prehistoric sit-com, laugh track and all. Beautiful costumes & puppets from Henson's creature shop! Sadly the One-joke premise was easy to maids, the recycling of traditional sitcom stories with a Dino twist, came off tired anyway.

Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Saga combines the RTS (real-time strategy) Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds and its Episode II mission expansion Clone Campaigns in a single package. This sells for less together than they did (or do) apart, so make sure its SAGA.Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Saga challenges using over 50 battle campaigns from the classic and prequel Star Wars universe EXCLUDING Episode III., this predates that prequel. But it is sort of the poor-man's EMPIRES @ WAR, which does include the complete SAGA, but is also very expensive right now, this is a good game to hold you over until EMPIRES becomes more affordable.Using the award-winning Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings game engine, Battlegrounds Saga allows players to deploy armies of Storm Troopers, Clones, Naboo, Battle Droids, Rebels, Gungans, and Wookiees. Players manage their units, structures, and resources in single- or multiplayer campaigns on Tatooine, Naboo, Endor, Hoth, and Geonosis. Play can be set in the prequel era of the SW SAGA up the Clone Wars, or original SW Trilogy settings controling Vader and his forces, and a post-FILM setting of the NEW REPUBLIC as seen in the SW NOVELS using LEIA and the other ex-rebels to battle the remnants of the Galactic Empire. Specific film characters (Like Han and Chewy)and book/COMIC characters (like MARA JADE & DARK TROOPERS) make appearances and can be controled. Less specific characters (like JEDI & SITH KNIGHTS) can be created and controlled.One of the unique features for advanced gamers, that is rarely called attention to, is the ability to construct your own "BATTLEGROUND" for actual use. You populate the field with your own mechanized armies (AT-ATs, Ties and more), characters, as well and master the scenerio settings themselves; including: text prompts that you pen your own text prompts, sculpt the landscape buildings it to suit the story, player-settings and sides offerings.This is a fun feature you won't find in EMIPIRES @ WAR.Like most engines of this kind, once you get a feel for the hot keys and short-cuts to managing your forces, figuring out what to build & the most economical way to use your buiding resources (because they are the key to winning) you will rapidly become more successful.

The Saturday morning animated follow up to the original Ghostbuster movie is here. Problem is there is no complete sets containing all of the '86-91 series, just random selects.The "Real Ghostbusters" so called because FILMATION had the TV rights for the "Ghostbusters" name back from a live action-low budget Saturday morning show with Forest Tucker and Larry Scorch as bumbling ghost catchers, along with a guy in an ape suit. Filmation revised their concept after the unrelated Ivan Reitman film was a success, so there was briefly competing animated Ghostbuster cartoons. The REAL Ghostbusters succeeded inpart because it had all the recognizable props from the movie, the characters Ray, Egon, Winston and Peter Venkman. But chiefly, it boasted some of the best voice talent in TV animation: the great Maurice LaMarche(with loads of voice credits most recently working on the new FUTURAMA MOVIE for Dec of 2007) Arsenio Hall (so to be TV late night host), Frank Welker (of Scooby Doo fame as FRED) and Lorenzo Music, who is most famous as the voice of GARFIELD was ironicly replacing Bill Murray as Venkman, who would later serve as the new voice for the Cat in two feature films. The series also had some notable writers like Michael J. Straczynski of BABYLON 5 note.Later after several seasons the series evolved into the SLIMER and the GHOSTBUSTERS show, featuring Slimers adventures before he meet the GBs.This one features a bonus episode which happens to be the SECOND EPISODE for the cartoon series: Killerwatt.The animation is more polished on this one, more like the opening credits, all the way though. Later the time constraints would make future episodes less remarkable overall, except for Proton pack fights which tended to look glossy. Killerwatt is the story of a ghost who is possessing electrical appliances involving the boys in some dept. store battles and ultimately a big showdown with the power behind the possessions. Introducing the ECTO-2, a ghost-fightin' helicopter, the new bigger containment system and the multicolored GB uniforms (along with hair highlights for the crew, and a rat-tail for Spengler).Also on this DVD Night Game (Field of Dreams meets Faust), the Bird of Kildarby (NYC castle haunting), Lost & Foundry.Watch for "Ghosts-R-US" the series pilot, which starts with a shot at the cartoon ghostchasing rivalry by having some ghosts pretending to be "ghostbusters" in order to put the "real" ghostbusters out of business.Maybe the 40 episodes of 1997 Extreme Ghostbusters will return in DVD form too.

The awkward investigators Petra and Calder (from Chasing Vermeer) return in this sequel. Petra who, uncomfortable with herself, wishes she was a famous writer without having to go through the unfamous stage, and Calder, obsessed with pentominoes (math tool made of 5 squares sharing one side), puzzles and playing with coincidences , the pair are finishing their 6th grade year. They're joined by Calder's friend Tommy (mostly absent in the first book), who has returned to town and resents the friendship formed by Petra and Calder in his absence. The uncomfortable trio learn through their teacher, Ms. Hussey, Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House is about to be cut into four pieces and sent to different museums. They origanize a movement to save the place, but there's more going on at Robie House than meets the eye: strange lights, worker injuries, hidden codes, and a house that may have a mind of its own. Readers who enjoyed liked Chasing Vermeer will probably enjoy this sequel and solving another mystery with Balliett's young sleuths. There are more art crimes, more clues hidden in pictures, more codes to solve, more pentominoes, more mathematical, literary, and historical connections -- more of everything that made the first book fun. The additional dynamic of Tommy's return makes for some interesting scenes with each character and their own quirks and perspectives taking on a real life of their own in this adventure. Book lovers, young and old, will see themselves in the main characters.There are many more clever bits, as in the original, leading to many twists and turns generating quite a lot of higher order thinking possiblities. Some of the clever bits are mostly extraneous. Like the original You don't need to find the hidden pictures, again provided brillantly by Brett Helquist of Lemony Snicket's Events or decode the codes (both verbal and pictorial) or understand pentominoes to follow the story -- none of them are integral, but they are fun. While the author introduces interesting sub-strands, like an "Invisible Man" connection, interesting characters like a caped stranger on a train, and interesting ideas like the living house & telepathy and then sometimes drops them without their having served any purposes. As they travel through this mystery, they can find and decode the clues, both verbal and pictorial, scattered throughout the book. Mystery and art lovers will certainly enjoy it, and if their not careful kids might just learn something about FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT and architecture. A good read for 10-14 year olds readers, art teachers and mystery fans of all ages.
