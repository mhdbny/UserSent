This movie was a pleasant surprise for my family (most of us anyhow). One of my teens thought it was stupid. The rest of us loved it.As a kid I grew up watching Batman on TV. This show gave me an origin to the entire concept of the show from the beginning by carefully and compellingly laying a foundation for how and why Batman uses the image he does and how he overcomes evil. It is a movie we will end up buying, not just renting, because we'll want to see it from time to time.If you are a firstborn, and carry the 'hero' mantle in your family, you will no doubt love this movie. It appeals to your internal sense of justice in a refined way that rejects some of the eastern tendencies that bother some of us. At the same time I flaw the plot for providing no realistic solution for the inability of men to overcome their internal battle against evil desires. The idea that sheer will power will do it seems rather pale to me. So it's a four star....but the rest of the movie is really good.Kids can watch it and enjoy it because the bad language and sexual connotations that many movies contain were absent by and large. Even the recently released 'Robots' contained a lot of references to gender confusion...yet this movie was refreshingly free from those common 'flies in the ointment' (if you will).Honestly the other Batman stuff I've seen in the last few years never made me happy. As an old 60's Batman and Robin guy this was the first movie on Batman that I've seen that I thought was worth watching. It left me satisfied with the question of why is Batman Batman...and how did he really get started and why? That's the name of the movie...so I guess it delivered...Batman Begins. See it if you haven't. I think you'll agree...at least most of you will.

I'm a pastor who studies in the original languages for my sermon prep. My wife knows I have grown to love the ESV, and gave this to me so I could have a physical copy (I use BibleWorks 7.0). It's very close to the Greek/Hebrew text, yet very readable in English. So no more do we have to choose between the extraordinarily literal NASB or the very readable NIV (but not as close to the original). The ESV will most likely become a major English bible, if not THE English bible in the next ten years or so. It truly is a wonderful translation...and that is the most important part of a bible that you purchase.This bible is light, easy to carry, and feels so wonderful that everyone who picks it up immediately has wanted their own copy. It's a red letter edition. One reviewer criticized the paper quality. I think for a $20 bible you cannot expect 'the moon'. The paper is not bad, it's prettygood in my view. The printing does bleed through the page a bit, but it is not too strong, and I think that is typical for a thinline inexpensive bible.The one criticism I think is worth considering is that this bible has no cross reference system. It would be really great if they could adopt something like Greek NT cross reference system or something that is accepted by scholars from a cross section of the Kingdom. A good cross reference column would make this bible busier than I would like it to be, but it might be very handy for bible study.One positive feature not mentioned is the 12,000 word concordance in the back. It's very good.The fonts are large enough that I can read this bible without glasses. That's a great feature for those of us who are past 40. I have a lot of bibles. This one is just a great bible. If you need something readable and small, it is the very best ESV I have been able to find. If you want just a readable ESV, I recommend the more expensive single column leather, because it is more enjoyable to read and has a great cross reference system.One more note, if you are into the latest...be aware that in January 2007 Crossway released a digital update of the ESV. That means that digital versions in professional grade software like BibleWorks 7.0 have a slightly different version than these printed copies. I found that out during a bible study on Romans 8 when someone read a paragraph for me.In my final view, I think every English speaking Christian should get a copy of the ESV. I have become a great fan of this wonderful translation, only after doing careful exegesis and my own translations of many paragraphs in the New Testament. In those projects I have compared the ESV, and usually six or seven other translations to my own work and I've found that the ESV is almost always the very best translation. For anyone who does read Greek or Hebrew, this version is a real must. If you've been reading NIV for years, I recommend you make the switch to this new version. We just moved our entire congregation to this bible and people do seem to really love it!

First let me comment on this translation of the bible. The ESV will become the standard english bible among evangelicals in the next several years for a few reasons.This translation follows the Hebrew/Greek more carefully than the NIV, NLT, CSV and all other contemporary translations, except for the NAS.The NAS is equivalent to the ESV in following the original text.So is the NKJ, but the ESV is superior to the NKJV because it uses the best Greek/Hebrew texts available and the NKJV follows the textual tradition dating back to England in the 17th Century inspite of the libraries from Russia, the Middle East and other centers preserved through the ages.The ESV is better than the NAS because it is easier to read in English than the NAS. Let me illustrate:ESV Hebrews 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.NAS Hebrews 13:1 Let love of the brethren continue.This pattern follows throughout the whole NT.So my first point is that the ESV follows the Hebrew/Greek as well as the most literal translations. (NAS). ESV sounds more like the way we speak today, which is a crucial element in a translation of the bible. The ESV avoids adding phrases and words to accomplish this. The NIV and many others err by adding phrases/words to try to help the translation process out. Let me illustrate:Philippians 2:1 has a phrase in Greek 'En Kristo' which basically means 'in Christ'. It can carry a lot of nuances to it, but it literally translates as 'in Christ'. Note how the ESV carries this through, but the NIV and the NLT try to interpret it by adding other words.ESV Philippians 2:1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ,NIV Philippians 2:1 If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ,NLT Philippians 2:1 Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ?So En Kristo with the NIV becomes 'from being united with Christ' when it probably should be just 'in Christ'.The NLT makes it out to be 'from belonging to Christ' when it should be just 'in Christ'.So both of those translations actually add an entire prepositional phrase to the Greek text 'En Kristo'. For those of us who read Greek, this is exactly why we have grown to love the ESV. It's just more accurate.So almost everyone I know who reads Greek/Hebrew loves the ESV and has switched to it. I certainly did, after comparing about 50 passages over a year or so with other versions, I have come to trust the ESV above all the other english versions I have.Now on this particular format, it is an inexpensive paperback with inexpensive paper. That is expected in a low cost give away bible like this. Having said that, the paper is a bleached white with pretty good font (Kind of like a high quality newspaper). Here's my test for a good font...'if I can read it, that's pretty good'. I cannot read the fonts on many bibles because I'm in my mid 40's and my eyesight is not as good as it used to be. I can read this one without any trouble at all...so it's a good font.The spine is glued, and holds together without any problems.Also, this bible uses the 2001 text for the ESV. There is a new 2007 text that is just coming out. But it is almost the same, and I wouldn't worry about that at all.I heartily recommend this version. Our church has switched to it as our 'official worship service version' and we have copies of this edition scattered throughout the sanctuary for people to use.We bought a case of these and have given most away. Our youth use them in SS class and they are holding up after about 6 months of use.I think this particular bible is a great deal on a great translation!

First I would like to point out that the dark cover shown in the first photo for this product is not the one the publisher is shipping. Oswald Chambers highlights the ability of God in contrast to our inability. And then he challenges you directly to wholly lean on God for your strength to obey God. He emphasizes that the Holy Spirit will come through to help you obey. He's very direct without fancy illustrations. However his typical word picture or illustration usually packs a whale of a punch, driving home the point with a spiritual weightiness not found in many books. I love this guy and highly recommend this particular book. It's worth every penny. An illustration of this is how he couches the idea that you are the salt of the earth against the idea that God has not called us as some seem to believe to be the sugar of the earth. In a few sentences he demolishes what was a very popular view of how Christians should be. He then examines the effects of salt in a few situations (wound dressing for one example) to show that we must impact those around us even if it doesn't feel good for them initially.He doesn't waste your time with long stories that feel good but don't have a lot of power in them. He packs each paragraph. There are many meaty thoughts in this book. Don't hesitate to purchase a copy if you have an extra eight bucks.

This is a great product. I use a laptop professionally. I noticed immediate relief of shoulder and elbow pain. It'well designed with GREAT sound (even though the speakers are partially blocked...it's actually really nice to play songs through this. Also, the base is very stable, yet flexible.I had never installed one of these and yet had it running within a few minutes. Redocking now is about a 10 second process. Set your laptop down, plug it into the side port...that's it. Very simple. I like the mouse and keyboard it has...I'm sure there are superior ones out there, but these work perfectly.Overall I have to give this a five star.

We have kids of all ages (8 to 25). Their teen friends (13 & 16) love this game as well as all my kids. My wife loves this game. It's a lot of fun for everyone. My 8 year old beat the rest of us (and several of us know our Disney stuff). So the game's design is balanced enabling younger players to do really well.This is the kind of game that you can play over and over and not grow tired of it. I heartily recommend this game (unless you never watch Disney movies).

This was a movie I had decided to skip. I thought it would be cheesy. Only after my wife and kids picked up a copy did I change my mind...mainly just to be with the family.I was surprised. It's a great movie. I will watch it again. First-the effects are exceptionally realistic. I kept wondering...how did they make King Kong look so realistic? And some of the actors were excellent.The plot was predictable, and we all know how the story goes...yet it was still fantastic to watch. I have to say it's a five star movie that I expected to be a three star. Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie.I did notice one flaw in the movie...immediately after falling into a river two lead actors (Jack & Ann) change scenes and are running for their lives down the road...they had just climbed out of the river and voila! Their hair is dry and they really don't look wet at all even though they almost just died in the river.I think that one or two death scenes in the movie are particularly gruesome...so I would not let little ones watch this movie. There is also a lot of profanity in the beginning of the movie...too much.The humanization of King Kong was done with such slight effects that it was believably unbelievable. It's just a great movie overall and gets a great movie vote from me.It's the king of kong flicks that's for sure and most people would really like this movie from my perspective. So get a copy and have a great time.

First off I want to say that I audited a course by the author of this book, and read through the book throughout the semester. It is part of the core curriculum for an M.A. in New Testament or Old Testament Exegesis at Wheaton. I am a pastor who preaches regularly. This book has impacted my entire understanding of the Old Testament in a powerful way.The logical format of this book gives the reader a simple and effective way to slowly enter into the worldview of ancient people. The author is very good at giving readers hinge concepts to help understand the distinctions between our worldview and their worldview.The book categorizes ancient near eastern thought into topics that are actually enjoyable to read. Each topic could easily overlap with other topics, and Dr. Walton does a great job of separating the topics without distorting them (in my opinion).This book tackles thorny issues that separate Evangelicals from Liberals in the land of scholars, without alienating either side of the issue. Walton's premise is that we should abandon the old approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Thought and simply understand what they believed, and how it was different from or the same as Old Testament thought.One concept that emerges as the book develops is the idea that some Israelite prophets argued for the support of the covenant with God rather than for the reinforcement of the Kings authority (as the prophets of other cultures and sometimes Israeli culture did). This sets Israeli prophets who held to the covenant with God at odds with everyone else who prophecied in Israel and around Israel. Coupled with the exclusiveness of the Jewish religion, and the people soon became alienated from those around them and sometimes from their own religion or people.Probably the most helpful aspect of this book is his excellent approach to comparative studies without labeling certain parts of the bible as extensions of other cultures or vice versa. His approach, when properly understood, is actually what both sides of the historical divide on this topic ought to be doing. I find it not only full of wisdom, but extremely helpful in preparing sermons from the Old Testament.A nice companion to this volume is The Bible Background Commentary of the Old Testament. I think that this book shows you how to use the Bible Background Commentaries.One criticism that I would like to mention is that some of the charts in this book are a bit difficult for me to understand. That's an area that the next edition may have to improve on. However, there are only a few pages like that and the rest of the book is really a very very good summary and introduction to Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament.Some of the topics he covers include but are by no means limited to:The Ancient View of the World.The Ancient view of the heavens.The Ancient view of TemplesThe Ancient view of Omens and Magic.I think he has around 13 topics in all. This book is well worth reading and if you plan to teach from the Old Testament over the years, you might want to pick up a copy for your personal library. It's packed with helpful references also.

Although these are less expensive at your local Cracker Barrel (if you have one), this little toy is a great addition for an office where seriousness is all too often the overarching theme. Pokey gives children visiting an office something they gravitate towards immediately. (Cracker Barrel has a similar pokey for about $2 less).Of course, you can also give this to a child as a gift, but I think the best use is for men over 40 who have childhood memories, and who need a minor diversion from time to time in their office.Get a Gumby too.

This is a pretty good study bible. It covers a lot of fascinating leadership concepts using scripture to draw out principles that Maxwell teaches. There are many instances of leadership passages or points that are skipped or missed, whether intentionally or unintentionally. So it is NOT an authoritative or exhaustive work on leadership issues in the bible.I would recommend this only as a resource for doing bible study on leadership. One must do their own exegesis of the text to see if the study bible's main points really match what the bible says there or if there is some tendency to insert Maxwellian ideas into the text.Generally speaking, this is a great tool that I use from time to time. As a pastor, I am always looking for good materials on leadership development. I think John Maxwell generally has some of the best material on the market for leaders, and this study bible has notes that fit in well with the rest of his 'stuff'.I hope you enjoy it.

Most of my commentaries on Isaiah are written by Christian scholars. Most of them are in English and read left to right. This one is by Jewish scholars and reads right to left. The concept is different and I really do enjoy it. As far as commentaries go, the bulk of the material in this book is Hebrew and English text of the scriptures. It is almost more like a study bible with a few notes on each column of material than it is like a typical commentary.Essentially this book is really a copy of the book of Isaiah with parallel versions (English and Hebrew). There are (as one review said) some annotations for the text on each page. The sparing comments do not really qualify for the billing as a commentary that the cover page displays in my mind. I would call this a really neat 'annotated parallel bible' that publishes the 'Old Testament' into 14 small volumes.For example, on Isaiah 27:2 the English text says "In that day sing ye of her: 'A vineyard of foaming wine!".His comments are:that day-the day of Israel's deliverance. a vineyard. Symbolizing Israel. foaming wine. The Hebrew word, chemer, is only found again in Deut 32:14. Several Hebrew MSS read chemed 'a delightful vineyard' as in Amos 5:11.Above this you see a column on the left with the English text and a column on the right with Hebrew text.Let me comment on the prices. Soncino Press offers these volumes in the latest printing for less than some of the used bookstores want for older volumes. I cannot for the life of me understand why the used versions are not about half price of the newer versions. There's really nothing special about the older versions of these commentaries.If you do not have computer aided software for the Old Testament, then these books are a great aid for anyone who reads some or a lot of Hebrew, but compared to software tools like BibleWorks 7.0, these tools leave a lot unsaid that the contemporary software tools give at the passing of a cursor.For Christian students, the view here is interesting, especially in passages like Isa 53 where the suffering servant is viewed as exiled Israel idealized. So incredibly they believe that Israel now is a victim in her suffering as an exiled nation. For excellent insight into this same passage, one would best read "Motyer" or "Oswalt" where you receive a plethora of exegetical as well as insightful expository comments and good application ideas.Value: I paid $8 for my copy of this book. I don't think it's worth much more than that, but it is worth owning.Still, I love the idea of this commentary and I do love the layout of the text with notes on the same page. They are worth owning bearing in mind the contextual issues I've raised in this note.

This exegetical guide is my favorite one because he gives practical step by step procedures for the exegetical side of a sermon. Note that the application of one's exegesis in the form of a sermon is not really the focus of the book. It's wise to look elsewhere for sermon development in that regard. But for exegesis, it is the finest volume I've read. In fact I used to own the previous version and upgraded to this one.What I've found very useful is to take the steps Fee has created and make them into a checklist in a word doc. Then when working on a text one can simply check off the items. If you become foggy on an area, Fee gives plenty of resources to round out your knowledge as well as descriptions through out the book.For students he gives a full exegesis guide also. That is actually the main portion of the book. But for pastors the 'Short guide' for sermon exegesis seems daunting at first, but when used, is extraordinarily helpful in developing a command of the text.Fee also gives a time guideline for each exegesis step. This gives you an idea for whether you work slower or faster than most. I've found it also helps me develop a schedule.Wouldn't want to pastor without this book. It's a great tool.If you preach regularly, or write lots of papers, this book will help you.

I bought this product when I was preparing for a sermon series through Galatians. I thought it was a dvd of people discussing Jonathan Edwards, the famous preacher from times past, and his views on Galatians. What it is though, is a modern guy with the same name and one other person I was unfamiliar with and they discuss Galatians and issues in the book. Their discussions were very good, and I actually did use this for one of my talks as seeds for studying.Just be aware that this dvd has nothing at all to do with The Jonathan Edwards.

I have come to love the Hermeneia series as a whole. And I do really like this author. He is quoted in many other commentaries on John's epistles, and has provided a wealth of interesting thoughts for the scholar or scholarly student.Here are some of the best things about this book.The format of the material is the most pleasant of any commentary I have on John's epistles. The pages are a bit larger (wider) with formatting to set off different parts of the material.He has an overview section from 1:5 through 2:17 called "Communion with God". In that section (I will look at 2:12-17) he has a number of subsets. Each natural paragraph is treated as a unit and then each verse individually. So everything is easy to find (a lot easier than the WBC series that's for sure). In 2:12-17 he calls the subset "Concrete Ethical Demands". He then gives a short overview of the paragraph. After that he starts in with vv 12-14. Underneath everything is a clearly separated footnoting section with dense bibliographical trails for the student or scholar who wants more on a particular jot or tittle. This is great for the pastor (like me) who wants to skip most of that stuff and get to the conclusions he makes. In vv 12-14 he spends a lot of time (several pages) dealing with nuances of the striking use of tenses for the verbs there. The reason it is important is because how one sees John's use of verbs here can feed into different theories on who wrote 1, 2, 3 John and why one scholar is correct vs another scholar in the debates around these sort of things.Well, that's important I suppose. But if you have to talk to people about the Bible who are not required to attend your lectures, there really isn't a lot in his several pages to inspire anyone. So for my purposes, I found his material interesting, but not very inspiring. In other words, I will use this commentary only for the more technical parts of my research. Almost all pastors never have time to get to that part of their sermon prep, so this commentary will have to remain a secondary resource at best for most pastors.Because of this, I only recommend this commentary for pastors who have a lot of time in their schedule to do extensive exegetical reading. It's really more of a scholars dream. So many great points in the battles that scholars work out on these things. From that perspective I think this is an excellent work and ought to receive a five star rating. But from a practical ministerial perspective, I recommend Smalley's work on John's epistles, which lacks the wonderful formatting of this series, but has a lot of inspiring and preachable points throughout.

I'm a pastor and own this commentary along with many, many other commentaries on Galatians. I bought this commentary so that I would have great application starter ideas for my sermons. I have to say that I'm probably not going to use it much more than I have to date. The main reason is that although I find Scot's reasoning to be sound, the ideas he explores (at least what I have read so far) do not really fit the text under review. So as I read his stuff, I keep thinking: Good point...that doesn't flow from this passage well, so I cannot use it at all here.Take the passage I preached through last Sunday, Galatians 2:1-10,ESV Galatians 2:1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. 2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain. 3 But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. 4 Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in--who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery-- 5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that a)the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. 6 And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. 7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised 8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), 9 and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. 10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.as an example. This is part of Paul's autobiography where he took Barnabas and Titus to meet privately with James, Cephas and John in Jerusalem. Their affirmation of his gospel is pivotal on the acceptance of Gentile churches. The issue is central for the gospel & evangelism. Instead of drawing applications that mirror central issues, or focusing on the culminating point (ministering to the poor), McKnight meanders through a discussion that ponders social nuances like which kind of music is best and how do we as believers navigate those sorts of issues. He spends a lot of time on things that in my view should not be applications from the passage at hand. He starts in about Southern Baptist music, vs contemporary worship and other things that have absolutely nothing to do with the passage OR the central issues in the passage applied to anything I could see.The result is that what I've read so far is pretty useless for pastoral studies. To be honest, there are many great works on Galatians on the market, and after looking at this volume, I don't believe it should be on a buy list for someone who has limited funds to work with as a pastor/bible student/teacher. I'm sure there are some really good sections in this volume, but I gave up on it before I could get that far. He lost me when he developed the kind of application I took the time to chronicle so far.For better applcation ideas on Galatians I recommend Stott's commentary. His exegesis should be checked by Jervis & Fung & Bruce who all seem to be more careful and balanced in their treatment of controversial items.Stott has apparently embraced Annihilationism of some sort, and his exegesis often wanders from the lexicons (I have not figured out why this is so, but he does it in every commentary I have studied-see my review on Stott's commentary on Ephesians for more on that), yet I think Stott is more helpful than McKnight. And I favor Fung's NICNT on Galatians far more than even Stott-see my reviews on those commentaries for more.In the above application I reviewed for McKnight, all four: Stott, Fung, Jervis & Bruce all had helpful things that I was able to draw application from for a sermon. McKnight didn't. I wish I could give a better review for this book. I love commentaries. Twas disappointed with this one. Sorry. Use your money on Fung first, then Bruce, Jervis, Stott, Smiley.The NIVAC series has some volumes which I have found to be excellent: See Isaiah by Oswalt as an example. I believe the editors of the NIVAC series ought to plan a replacement volume for the Galatians volume reviewed here. I'm sorry to have to report this, but that is how I honestly see it.

I have used this one several times. It is a great short commentary. Over and over I have found this commentary gives succinct reviews without skimping on the most important aspects.It is a beautiful complement to a fuller treatment like Fung or Bruce.Jervis brings clear and often teachable/preachable points for each passage. She also gives a careful handling of the text. I have not found a passage yet where she makes the error many commentators make, to insert their favorite theological persuasion into the text.I have used this book as a jumpstart when doing sermon exegesis and am short on time...or just when I need another perspective. It's one of my top five commentaries on Galatians. I give it a big thumbs up.

As a preaching pastor who is exegeting Revelation for a sermon series...and auditing a course on this book, I have found Hendriksen to be inspiring, writing on a level that most members of my congregation can track, and short enough to add on to a heavier load of reading (Say Aune or Beale on Revelation) without taking too much time.Some of his ideas are given without much defense. For example, he interprets the 'angel to the church of Ephesus' as the minister of Ephesus. I think things like that may be said without any explanation from time to time...and that is a weakness of the book. Some of the material is dated and reflects views that are not as common among scholars any longer..for example he teaches that Revelation 3:15-16 to the Laodiceans contains the concept that the "cold" are the heathen who have not had any contact with the Lord. He misses the point (usefulness-not so much an emphasis on zeal) and would probably rewrite that if he were here today.Though it needs updating this book is not an exhaustive resource. It's more of a devotional, yet scholarly interpretation of Revelation.Along with Vern Poythress on this same topic, this one is up there at the top of my list.Another strength of this book I'd like to mention is the simple, yet informative summaries he gives of a situation. Following up on the Ephesus example above, when describing the Church in Ephesus he takes the time to go over some apostolic history with the city and also mentions briefly some history through the centuries as it is relevant. So his summary paragraphs can be very useful for teachers of any view on Revelation. For that alone the book is well worth the price.Get a copy and enjoy it!

This is a well written commentary that is rich with references that feed into the meaning of each verse. The strong emphasis on sovereignty that good Presbyterians typically comes through in Boice's perspective (unique among the commentaries I have read) on why John wrote these letters. Boice skips all the statements by John in the earlier part of the letter where he says 'we write to you because...' and focuses on the last one in chapter 5. Boice says John didn't write for any other reason that to give the Christians assurance of their faith. The exclusive focus on assurance is not found in any other commentary I have read. This is Boice's strength. He brings unique concepts to the table. This is also his weakness. He has a bias towards the distinctive doctrines of Presbyterians. And this commentary clearly shows this bias.Yet even with the bias, this is a commentary that will feed the spirit with rich cuts of prime steaks. He is no slacker when it comes to thinking through the exegetical nuances of a passage. Even if you are not a Presbyterian (and I'm not), you will be blessed by Boice's thoughts. He's provoking and passionate about his faith in his expressions in this commentary.One point that I might note is that on some of his lexical work I was left wanting more. For example, in discussing 'ilasmos' the word often translated propitiation in 1 John 2:1-2, Boice tilts towards a legal definition giving almost a courtroom impression of this term. However, Smalley and others show extensively why this should not be viewed as a legal term in John, and Smalley gives the preferred meaning 'intercessor' or advocate in that sense of the word. So sometimes Boice is brilliant and other times I am left wanting a fuller explanation. This goes to show that it's good to consult more than one commentary, especially on crucial verses like 1 John 2:1-2.If you have thought deeply about the links between John 1:1 and Genesis 1:1..and the differences between the related passages, Boice will tie in to these concepts intelligently and in a way that is easily grasped and convincing. Overall I am very glad to have this particular commentary and highly recommend it to everyone. I use it quite often and it is in my top five commentaries for John's letters.

The plot is unique. As it unfolds you are drawn into it more and more. The boyfriend stuff is crass and some families will be offended by it.The producer who put that in this movie is a bit out of touch in my opinion. There is no enhancement from it and only offends people.That scene which several reviewers complain about is a minute or so in the whole movie. On to the rest of the movie. This movie is a horror flick that is animated. So it's kind of like a scary cartoon. The quality reminds me of a typical pixar movie.There are a few lines in the movie that are very predictable. The plot has some surprises that make it fun for most kids and teens to watch.Overall I would say it is one of the better movies we have watched recently and so I'm giving it a four star. I hope you enjoy it.

As a pastor, I always appreciate books that give ideas for developing sermon concepts. This book is very strong on pastoral tips for preaching through Luke. It delivers on the claim implied in its title.One of the points I disagree with this author on would be his view that Luke could not have written the gospel of Luke. I believe D.L. Bock and others have established a very solid case from multiple points to support the view that Luke, Paul's traveling companion, wrote this gospel. Nickle states the Luke could not have written this gospel. Other major commentators have convincingly concluded that Paul's traveling companion, Luke, did write this gospel.His conclusion reveals a bias. He also states that Luke is inconsistentwith Paul's own accounts of his travels...(that's part of his argument that the Luke who wrote this gospel could not have been Paul's companion).FF Bruce and others have laid that opinion to rest, in my view. I think this author would be viewed as tilting to the left by most evangelical pastors because of statements he makes about the historical integrity of Luke's gospel.I also have found that this book is not as detailed as some of the heavier commentaries (and it is not meant to be as detailed). But sometimes this can work against a pastor/teacher using this commentary. For example, at the end of the book on the road to Emmaus, there is a great chiastic structure that Nickle points out. However, the focus of the chiasm is not as clear in his analysis as it is in Joel Green's (NICNT). I found that Nickle missed two of the pairs in the chiasm. He also has an incorrect verse reference in the structure. I think that sometimes he is better for presentation ideas than for technical detail.Here is a summary of Nickle's chiastic structure for Luke 24 road to Emmaus.A - Jerusalem (leaving)....B - Jesus arrives........C - Their eyes are kept from recognizing Jesus.............D - Dialogue and Interaction........C' - Their eyes are opened to seeing Jesus....B' - Jesus vanishesA' - Jerusalem (returning to it)Thie leaves us looking at the very vague...D dialogue and interaction.In addition, he says Jesus vanishes in the wrong verse (not a big deal, but still an error).Joel Green (NICNT Commentary on Luke) gives a much more detailed chiastic structure for the same passage...AND look at the resulting clarity in the primary point of his chiasm. Jesus is alive!A. Journey from Jerusalem..B. Appearance...obstructed eyes...unable to recognize.....C. Interaction.........D. Summary of 'the things'..............E. Empty Tomb & Vision.................F. Jesus is alive.............E'. Empty Tomb but no vision.........D'. Interpretation of 'the things'......C'. Interaction..B'. Opened Eyes...recognition & vanishingA'. Journey to Jerusalem.Joel Green leaves you meditating on the point of the chiasm,that Jesus really is alive!. Nickle leaves you meditatingon the dialog and interaction of Jesus with the disciples.This story is in the chapter on the resurrection and exaltationof Jesus, and I have to say that Green's work is much more helpfulon this particular story.Having said all that, I love the 'royal rule' emphasis in this book. The inauguration of the Kingdom as an aspect of Luke's gospel needs to be preached. If a pastor has a theological grid for this, Nickle's concepts can be very helpful. As an evangelical pastor commited to announcing and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom of God, this particular Homiletical Commentary is packed with good ideas.For example, on Luke 9:28-36 Transfiguration account, Nickle draws the allusion to Moses and his appearance transformation. He encourages preachers to point out that the transfiguration is an inauguration of a new exodus. This sort of contrast to the OT/Law showing a contrast between Jesus and Moses is an excellent pointer (and this book has many of them) for sermon crafting.In my mind this book fits in well AFTER one has done his exegetical work on a passage...and during the time when you are hammering out crucial points for your sermon based on your exegesis. It is not a commentary, but an application guide.In my collection on Luke it fills a unique position, and is a welcome addition. I recommend this book for the pastor who has time and has a practice of doing careful exegesis before writing his sermons. For exegetical commentaries, I really like Bock (ECNT), Marshall (NIGTC) out of the ones I have. I would consult them BEFORE using Nickle. But where regular commentaries stop, great application tips, this book starts. It's a great idea.I do recommend this book with the qualifiers mentioned above.

First let me just say that as a pastor working on the Greek text for a sermon series through Thessalonians, I've found this commentary to be helpful in a few key areas.Primarily this author strikes me as one who has a seasoned grasp of the original Greek text, and yet also brings relevant import into the critical applications as they relate to the text. It is not what I would call a highly technical commentary. It does not deal with the views of Socio-Rhetoric, or spend a lot of time on theories that don't bear spiritual fruit for the reader. Instead this commentary tends to focus on application from other scriptures to the discussion of the text.Let me give you an example so you know what I mean.Let's take 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, a paragraph that focuses on the Coming of the Lord. For these six verses he gives us 13 pages of material. It is laid out well, with a verse marker for comments under each verse. He gives the text first, and then comments on each verse. He deals with Greek words if there is anything special about them. He gives the Greek fonts, and then discusses the relevant grammatical features and discusses the implications of those features. Instead of interlacing his comments with quotes from other commentators and interactions with their views, he footnotes all of those. I like this because I like to read an authors thoughts without all the back and forth interruptions those other citations can sometimes spawn.He typically cites just a handful of cross references to other passages and then discusses them more than other commentators. He likes to draw out the implications a bit more than most commentators. This really helps a pastor or bible teacher grasp his ideas for application more than most commentators. So I would suggest to you that this commentary is a Pastors friend. It will help you develop sermons.Exegesis: My experience with the exegesis in this volume is that he is fair, balanced, and avoids the temptation to jump to unwarranted conclusions. It's well done.Let me give you a little bit on 1 Thessalonians 4:13 so you see more clearly what I mean about this.From pg 136 "The Parousia is a difficult topic. Within the short space of the mission, it would have been impossible for the apostolic band to have given anything like complete instruction about it. Clearly they had spoken much of it, for the Thessalonian correspondence gives evidence of a lively interest in the whole subject. It is worth asking ourselves whether the comparative neglect of the doctrine in much modern Christianity has not resulted in great loss." He then discusses other issues revolving the portions of vs. 13 for 3 more pages. He has a number of great points from other scriptures that tie directly into all of this. I found the commentary to be inspiring.So what is missing? Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Citations. It's as if there was nothing in common between this letter and the intertestamental literature. He could have hundreds of citations.That's my big beef with this otherwise excellent book.

I always thought of Lightfoot as the scholar who gave us the Apostolic Fathers, including the Didache and Shepherd of Hermes Greek Texts and English translations. Then I discovered his commentary on Galatians. I have the tenth printing from 1890 London. The fonts are readable and clear. The book contains over 350 pages of scholarship on the six chapters of Galatians. It's a thorough commentary. Coupled with Luther on Galatians, we have a good glimpse into the history of commentaries on Galatians. References to Papias, Tertullian, Victorinus and many other Early Church Fathers are scattered throughout this commentary. He not only grasped the history and the Greek text, but he knows how to bring the Early Church Fathers perspective to bear when pertinent.The main text is presented is the actual Greek text (provided for him by Wescott & Hort before they actually published their text originally). After the Greek text he gives a word or phrase in Greek and then comments on it. A year of B-Greek is best for a full grasp of what he means by his comments. If you are exegeting through the Greek text you may want to keep this commentary open on your desk!Many great commentators on Galatians interact with the concepts that Lightfoot lays down. For example, on Galatians 6:2, Lightfoot discusses the probable interplay between the law Paul is discussing in Galatians (the law of Moses) and the stunning mention of the 'law of Christ'. I think that every commentator I have read, who is thorough, deals with the concepts Lightfoot mentions...with an effort given to defend any difference they have with his view. For example, Fung contends, after reviewing Lightfoot's position, that Paul is really more focused on the law of Christ as love, than as a replacement or interplay with the law of Moses. So the most current scholars all seem to either agree with Lightfoot or feel a need to explain why they would adjust what he says. He is not always mentioned in their articles, but if you read him first, you can see his influence clearly shining through.If you are interested in newer approaches of Historical Theology, then this book is essential for studying the historical views of Galatians in the late 19th and early to mid 20th century, because it played a huge part in the exegesis of Galatians during that time. Since it continues to be a force today, I would not be surprised to see a reprint of this by some publisher in the future.I am so happy I found a copy. I urge you to pick up a copy if you can find one. This is the commentary that almost all others still quote!

Before I became a pastor nine years ago, I read this book with my wife. It is one of the few books we keep a copy of in our bedroom. I make sure our booktable has a copy at the church...and I regularly still recommend this book.It's the most balanced and penetrating study on the fear of the Lord I have ever read. It changed my understanding of God and spiritual living and has had a good effect on many people we work with regularly. If you are thinking about getting this book my only recommendation is that you buy extra copies because you will probably want to keep yours....instead of loaning it out.

I have to differ from the other review on this book. I just finished preaching through Ephesians three months ago using this book. As a pastor who uses lots of commentaries and exegetes from the Greek text, I found the ease of using this tool very helpful. I can lay it open and compare what the ancients said about a phrase...and found many interesting thoughts that sometimes mirrored my own wonderings as I was wrestling with the Greek text. I've come to favor this as a tool that consistently gives me ideas that preach well...one just has to sometimes smooth out the verbage of the ancient commentators.I'm almost done working through Philippians with this book...and it has stayed in my book bag for most of the last five months. The highest value I get from this book is usually a meditation on a phrase or word in scripture...from the perspective of an ancient Church leader...and that perspective sometimes opens up some of the most penetrating questions or statements I make in a sermon. For this point alone the book has proven to be a great resource.It's really a meditation commentary more than a typical technical commentary. As you develop applications from your text exegesis this tool can be a fantastic tool. I'm hooked.

This commentary is worth owning for a number of reasons. (I'm a pastor working in the Greek text developing sermons right now on John's letters).Marshall's expository comments are well supported with clearly linked cross references that would fit well into any expository sermon. Sometimes he gives illustrations for the less transparent points of the text, which results in superior clarity for most readers. The augments which one reviewer called 'fluff' are not fluff at all. They are helpful meditative points that can be used in preaching. I love it when commentators bear their intended audience in mind and give a helping hand in context. That makes this commentary better than most.If you desire to deal in the Greek text, his footnotes are an excellent add on to that study. He also references a number of other scholars in the footnotes for more on any crucial points Marshall brings out.Overall, this is a five star commentary that anyone doing serious exegesis for a sermon ought to consult.

Basically we like this new printer. The fax works well, the printing speed is excellent, in draft mode it is blazing! And the draft quality works for me for about all my applications. The driver installed without problems by non-technical people. The problems I have with this printer are simple. The paper feed tray is awkwaard to snap into place, and I just get irritated with it. Now that I've had this printer for six months I have kind of developed a knack for the feed tray that doesn't irritate me as much as it originally did. Still they could do better on that feature.Our secretary has resorted to putting three sticky notes on this printer for people who are not familiar with it's idiosyncracies...so they don't break the plastic parts on top and in the tray feeder trying to get things done.So far no one has broken it and everyone loves the speed on it.Paper doesn't hang up...and we especially love the duplexing option (that's the specific model in this series we bought).I'm not convinced we receive the number of copies the sales person said it would produce, but the efficiency/cost of ink per page has dropped significantly for us as a whole.I think in the high quality mode, which we don't use a lot, it makes a great print also.The fax and scan modes work with the automatic feeder on top of the unit just fine. I just faxed a seven page document with this unit yesterday and it worked ok. I was nervous about it because I had not used that feature on printer before, so I babysat it. I thought it was easier than our other printers (older multi function HP's).For the money and performance, we are saving a lot of time when we need to print two sided copies. Our ink cost savings paid for this printer. I wish we had upgraded months ago.Enjoy this product. It's a really good printer.Addendum: Last week our office was broken into. The burglar smashed a window by this printer. The window was 6'8" tall and 51" wide. There were perhaps 50,000 pieces of glass all over the office, including pieces all over this printer. The burglar put his print on the lid of this printer (he pushed off it climbing into our office), so the detective took the lid to their lab for processing. After reinstalling the lid a few days ago, the printer works on the first try. I guess even though the housing is plastic this little printer is pretty tough. It took a pounding of glass shattered all over it (three buckets full in total) and still works fine.

I'm not big on movies. This one is big. I don't normally watch R movies. This one is R because of the realistic battle scenes.I was struck with character quality after character quality throughout the movie. By the end of it, my soul was ringing with words like, 'courage, valor, honor, dignity, purity, perfection'. I have to say that I felt I was educated in Japanese history/culture to a degree by this movie.I have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie. The battle scenes are 'glorious', and the shifts from normal speed to slo-mo are perfect. Sound also has some zoom effects that don't distract, but add to the themes of this movie. It is a movie I will watch again sometime. Excellent movie. You should see it if you haven't yet. I think it will make you want to go to Japan (it had that effect on me).

Honestly I bought this commentary because someone recommended it, but I didn't expect it to surpass many of the others I looked at. But it did.Koester has provided the best overview of the history of church use on Hebrews that I have found anywhere. Just reading the beginning 100 pages of this commentary is worth the purchase price.He has a view on Hebrews that is slightly different than many of the authors I have read, but it is an interesting and compelling approach. He demonstrates this view by simply providing an outline of his own translation along with his own section titles. I am not sure that I'm convinced by his view, but he makes a strong case in the least.For scholars, this work has a lot of meat. His cross references to extra biblical material are extensive as are his theological links. For the pastor/bible teacher, this author provides a wealth of information. It tilts towards the technical side of things rather than the inspirational, so may be best used in the early and middle stages of exegesis.For those who are interested in the background influences of a book like Hebrews, Koester's dealing with Platonic influence is (in my view) a relatively mature perspective. For example, on pg 98 he has a theological summary of Hebrews with a series of topics in mind. One of them is the 'Cosmos' and it's influence in Hebrews. There he gives a quick summary of two broad views of Hebrews, and a short list of significant authors who hold to each of the two views (but his list reaches back to the second century in church history). He then suggests that both approaches have an appeal, but also miss the mark a tad, and that an adjusted view incorporating both perspectives is probably the order of the day.Let me give you a bit of his stuff right out of the book."The outcome of Christ's work and the realization of God's designs are described in terms of rest 4:10, entering a sanctuary 10:19-22, and arriving in the heavenly Jerusalem 12:22-24. Some interpreters have construed this goal in SPATIAL categories, as arrival in a higher realm like that envisioned by Platonic philosophy. See Clement of Alexandria and Origin. Eusebius. Spicq, Laub, Grasser, Dunn.Others think of it in TEMPORAL categories, as arrival in the age to come that is mentioned in apocalyptic sources. Barrett, Goppelt, Williamson, Philo, Lane.Koester says that the problem is that Hebrews operates with both categories (spatial and temporal), yet it fits neatly into neither category. He has more that supports this on pgs 59-63.Koester says, rather than focusing on traditions that might lie behind the text, we can compare Hebrews to Platonic and apocalyptic patterns in order to sharpen the way we perceive the constellations of ideas within the text. (He has a commentary on Revelation that I would like to read now-and I have a wide range of Revelation commentaries, some of them are very good).See his diagrammatic boxes on pg 98 for more information. He compares conscience with mind and these two are oppposed to 'sarx' (flesh) in Hebrews and in Platonism. He deals with the negative view of 'faith' in Plato and how that doesn't fit well with Hebrews.Without rambling too much here let me say that he identifies matching concepts from Plato, which scholars/authors agree with that position...and then shows in a few quick points why that probably needs to be rethought.I'm not a scholar, and I don't know much about all of these things, but I thought his work was very helpful for me personally to capture the gist of what a broad group of scholars and historical works teach on something within two pages was very helpful. I am not studied well enough to know if he is correct, but he cites sources and it is not that difficult to check out his claims on a crucial point. So I really like Koester's work.On the elevation of the concept of faith in Hebrews juxtaposed to the mind in Platonic thought, he cites Kasemann. I don't always agree with Kasemann, but he is worth studying and is never boring nor irrelevant (see Kasemann primarily on Pauline works).Kasemann citation "there is no other way from changeableness to unchangeableness other than through faith, bound to the Word, which marks the only bridge between the two worlds!" So Koester does bring in some great thoughts from others and seems faithful to cite the author.I have to say that I am very, very pleased with this commentary. If you are teaching a course on Hebrews, or preaching through Hebrews, I think you ought to consult this ocmmentary repeatedly.The finest contribution in my view is the overview of the use of Hebrews in various ancient church controversies...even into the reformation era. His grasp of historical uses of Hebrews is refreshing. I find myself getting blessed over and over as I refer to this book.I do have one concern about the quality of the binding. On my first reading through, one of the pages nearly fell out of the book. (one corner holds it in place with a 1/4" of glue). I've had this copy too long now to take advantage of Amazon's return policy. I don't know if I will get a replacement or now, it's just one page. It's a paperback with a glued binding, and I've found those tend to be less durable.I think I would recommend the hardback version of this commentary rather than the paperback.

This book is so good that I decided to preach a sermon series from it. I have even blogged the chapters into preachable outline forms at www.jesusquestions.blogspot.comIt is really an introduction to the seven most common questions people exploring Christianity tend to ask. Nicky gives a mix of responses in a rapid fire sequence that touches on key issue after key issue in a logically laid out and well organized, convincing fashion. For the open minded, his answers summarize a variety of issues which synthesize into a tincture that paints a convincing portrait. The result is clusters of sweet grapes of thought that can be developed in further discussion between interested people to help round out the critical issues related to the seven most common questions. (I won't repeat them since other reviewers have written about them). Some of his points are not as convincing as others...some stray from the question at hand and really are not part of answering the questions he raises...yet Nicky seems to present an overall package of concepts that forge a formidable argument for anyone who is a seeker of Christ. I also think this book is useful for Christians who struggle with some doubts...and for those who are sharing their faith...ideas on how to share their faith.So, I have decided to preach from this book a series that takes a look at each question one at a time. Nicky's material is so well organized I've found that borrowing his outline for the most part (with credit given of course) only needs slight modification in order to develop powerful sermons. The first chapter, Why does God allow suffering, was easy to develop a sermon outline from and a joy to preach through. I heard a lot of positive feedback on it as well. Especially encouraged were these who are or have suffered the most. He was lacking on the issues covered by the book of Job, for this chapter.... Nicky's material should really be seen as a summary introduction to this strategic topic.Here is a short outline of chapter two, called, 'What about other religions'?. This gives you an idea of how he approaches the questions.1) Is Jesus the only way to God?A) Unique qualifications of Jesusa. The Righteous Oneb. The author of lifec. Foretold by the prophetsd. Worshipped by the early churchB) Unique achievements of Jesusa. The Saviorb. Buddha claimed to be a teacher, but not a saviorc. Mohammed claimed to be a prophet, but not a saviorC) Unique in his resurrectiona. Christ's resurrection is central to Christianityb. Buddha claimed to enter into nirvana, but not to be with his followers.c. Mohammed never claimed to be resurrected.2) What do we say about other religions?A) Partial revelation of God in natureB) Foolishness of atheismC) Law of God on the hearts of menD) Eternity in the hearts of menE) Expect to see good in other religions1) Commitment2) Dedication3) Devotion4) Many ideas that match general revelation to some degree5) These commonalities do not mean they are all equal paths to God.F) Don't expect all religions to have the same level of truth in them.1) How can a religion lead to God if it denies God exists personally?2) Absurdity to say that religions which contradict each other are equally true.3) By comparing other religions to Jesus we can see where they err.4) The argument that this is narrow-minded fails because the opposing views are at best the minority view and must embrace a `narrow-mindedness of some sort to be accepted.3) What about those who have never heard of Jesus?A) We have confidence that God will be seen as completely just in the final evaluation of all people.B) Simple faith is answered by God for those who have not heard of Jesus.C) Those who cry out to God will find Him (as He promises).4) Our response to other religionsA) Be humble-realize we are sinful people saved by grace...no better than anyone else.B) Be positive-not attacking other religions but preaching Christ crucifiedC) Be respectful-realizing all are made in God's image even if they don't know Christ yet.D) Be bold even if the message is rejected.Pastors should use this book. Lay leaders and small group leaders should use it. Christians of all kinds can use this to help them grow spiritual and to remove barriers to their faith in Christ.I highly recommend this book.

If you are somewhat familiar with Greek, then this tool will fascinate you. Sitting down and looking at the columns of Greek text for the four gospels side by side is a rare delight.For textual criticism and comparative gospel studies in the synoptics or with John, this book is unlike anything else in my library. The binding and paper quality are superior as well and it's a great value in my opinion.As a preaching pastor, I plan to use this extensively the next time I do a sermon series from the gospels. For scholars it is recommended by Gordon Fee in his New Testament Exegesis 3rd edition, which is why I bought it. Fee says you need this resource for gospel exegetical work. I can see why he says that after going through several portions of this great tool.If you can-buy it!

This printer works really well. Unlike the person who said it printed reddish photos, I found this printer to be excellent. It is a great printer that we have used for over a year now without any trouble. Even my first grader uses it without trouble.I like the memory card reader that's built in. Often I just load my photosmart camera pictures into the computer through my printer. It's faster and I get a nice little screen on the printer to guide me on each photo.I've also found HP to be top when it comes to service....but haven't needed to use that on this printer yet!

The concept in this cd is great. The price is fair. The technical features on the cd are very easy to use and to play back. I installed it on my laptop in a few minutes and played it back on Windows Media player immediately. The tracks are labeled correctly. Everything seems fine.Then I played it for my Hebrew instructor. He started laughing. The pronunciation is not at all like modern Hebrew. So, if you are like me and you want to learn Hebrew in order to read the bible, but you also might want to be able to say something to Israeli's if you ever go there on a trip, then by all means DON'T use this product. It will drill into your head the wrong way to speak Hebrew.However, if you don't plan to go to Israel and do plan to use your biblical Hebrew in a context where the older American style Seminary pronunciations are in play, then this is the perfect tool. Unfortunately, those pronunciations are falling out of favor more and more.So, if you are like me, then this product is not something to spend time and money on at all, even though it is well packaged and priced fairly.I think products that feature audio recordings of a language ought to use a native speaker of that language. Shame on Zondervan for failing to recognize this and provide us with a native speaker, and for not labeling this product with some sort of declaration that it uses a method of speech that most Israeli's think sounds funny to their ears.I'm sorry I cannot recommend this product. Someone ought to come out with an audio recording of a real Israeli speaking all the words correctly.

We found that many of the meals in this book are really good and not too difficult to make. It's easy to find the items and the meals are usually really good. But if you have children like we do, they probably won't eat these meals very easily. So in a situation where one has kids, you may find meals they like in this book, but you may end up making two meals for every meal...and that doesn't last very long.For example: The book gives a Seafood Pasta Salad on pg 269. The full page photo and easy instructions are great. Put that in front a first grader and he will turn his nose up at it.The ingredients for this menu item are simple. There are nine common ingredients including bow tie pasta, and frozen or cooked crab meat.The directions are easy. Everything about this book is great in my view, except most kids we know, including our own, won't eat these menu items. Even though we've had to back off from using this book because of that we still keep it handy and I think it's a great recipe book for meals without kids.But if you don't have kids...or if you have the patience to make multiple options for meals...or want to force your kids to eat like you are...then this is a great way to go. The nutrition is balanced using ingredients that are not hard to find...nor too expensive for a regular budget.

I have to disagree with two of the reviewers here who have some negative comments on this commentary. As I am preaching through Hebrews, I've been looking at a number of commentaries. I look for helpful exegetical comments and summarizations, interaction with other scholarly viewpoints, and for spirituality in the comments. I believe Bruce gives us all three categories.Let me illustrate what I mean. F.F. Bruce sees Hebrews 1 as part of a larger section of material extending through the end of chapter 2. He titles this 'The Finality of Christianity'. He then breaks chapter 1 into two parts, v.1-4 (more than prophets, Jesus is God) and 5-14 (superior to the angelic beings-citing seven groups of verses). He points out there are seven statements about Christ in v. 1-4 and seven scripture quote sections in v.5-14. He then goes on to draw implications from these that are helpful for the scholar somewhat, but more so for a bible course teacher or a preacher in the pulpit. One of his applications is the demolition of the JW view that Christ was originally an angel. After all the second section deals entirely with the concept that Christ is superior to angels.His exegetical comments on the term 'universe' in Hebrews 1 help cut the legs out from under a lynch pin in the heretical view called 'open theism'. Although he doesn't take time to dive into the controversies, if you are familiar with them even a little, his comments are enough to help you realize that these verses are very significant in crucial debates among contemporary Evangelical circles.I just found the observations he makes skip over the superfluous ones I have read in some other commentaries. His points seem pretty convincing and pretty relevant. I think this is another excellent commentary from F.F. Bruce. It's amazing to me that one man could produce so many good commentaries on so many different books of the bible.I also think his material would help a SS teacher who goes deep in his classes. Although one doesn't need to know Greek to use this commentary, he deals with significant points in the Greek text.Again in chapter 1 he points out that the scepter of uprightness uses a term which originally meant 'straight'. The idea of just or straight measurements does help clarify the exact nuance of the sort of rule referenced by this passage (I don't think this is an etymological fallacy-but a helpful insight by Bruce).After reading several commentators besides Bruce, I found others to either lack in exegetical balance but to contain a lot of spiritual vim and vigor...or to be exceptionally boring and technical. This commentary blends scholarship and spirituality well. I would say it is truly superior to most of the other commentaries I have. Other excellent ones on Hebrews include Ellingworth and Murray. Lane is good also.

He starts out with a story about a college ministry that had a couple of students who were sleeping together (unmarried). When the campus minister approaches them with scripture verses that condemn their behavior, their response was "that's your interpretation"....hoping this stuns his readers (I'm not sure it stuns as many today as it would have 10 years ago)...he goes on to establish his premise that the bible is not a book with things for us to draw out of it whatever we feel is good for us....but rather a book that actually teaches certain things which comprise truth. From there he logically expands to cover a wide array of topics sequencing through the various issues of what Bible Scholars call 'Hermeneutics'. Biblical Hermeneutics is the art of interpreting scripture correctly.I find his writing style to be inviting, concise, to the point and well organized. It's a really good book...on a subject that is not as easy to write about as it may first appear.This book is a good primer for lay leaders as well as college students who are being introduced to the topic for the first time. We are using it to prepare our church leaders for an upcoming seminar on hermeneutics.One of the things I like about this textbook is that it covers the historyof interpretation in a short period of time (pp 79-118), so the new student can come up to speed on what the history of interpretation has been in crucial time periods of Christianity. For example he focuses on Luther/Calvin hermeneutics and then modernity hermeneutics after that. He covers all the 'turning points' historically of hermeneutics. The quick overview is a really good primer for newbies in biblical hermeneutics.For a busy pastor/bible teacher who has not had much or has forgotten their hermeneutics training...this book gives you a relatively easy read without sacrificing crucial elements. It will refresh you on the key elements of hermeneutics. If you are studying hermeneutics right now, and your course doesn't use this book, it is a good one to add for additional research or reading.Five star...you really ought to add this one to your library.

All of the great commentators I have read on Romans, including Moo, Stuhlmacher, Edwards and many others all interact with Lloyd-Jones' series on Romans. It reads more like an exegetical sermon with lots of theological commentary mixed into the exposition. It is a highly inspiring set of books.The way I was first introduced to this set was by reading the volume which dealt with Romans 3 first. It is the kind of stuff you could use in a reading group.Everyone who is preaching through Romans, teaching it or studying it for a serious course (college or grad) should consult this series.

This book is an excellent book for generic change issues. Quinn covers a lot of issues that will help business execs in a variety of situations. Having been a small business owner for years, I saw a number of things that would have helped me in those days. For example, he talks about willingness to change. He couches this topic with the sentence that starts out with 'walk naked into...'! He knows how to hook a reader, yet doesn't throw in a myriad of illustrations (like some other authors in this field). I found myself wanting to immediately apply every chapter as I read it.After years of small business activity, I find myself now leading a church in Illinois. An excellence course I am taking recommended this book. I can see a lot of applications for churches as well. However, I find that I disagree with his premise that you can change yourself. So many people I work with lack the ability to transform themselves, and I am unconvinced his 'alignment' idea is all that is needed.For the Christian business leader or church member or pastor, the power to change must come from an encounter with God through prayer and scripture meditation. Instead of reinventing ourselves, we die daily to our old nature and put on the new man in Christ Jesus. This enables us to flexibly apply Quinn's excellent principles.So I would only add some good old Christian theology to the power points in his message. Otherwise I think this is a great book and I heartily recommend it.

This lexicon is one of my favorites. I ran across it years ago when interacting online with a group of scholars (I'm not a scholar, just a pastor-doing sermon exegesis from the Greek Text). They cited Spicq's definition of 'agape' which I found to be the very best definition in any lexicon. When he deals with a term, he does it exceptionally well. The problem with this set of books is that he does not deal with every word. If it was more exhaustive, then it would be a five star set...and for what it covers it is a five star in my mind.When Spicq does handle a term he usually leaves you with a clear grasp of its meaning and how to apply it in any direction including for sermon applications. For this reason it is superior to BDAG or many other lexicons which give more abbreviated definitions of terminology covered. I recommend it as an excellent tool for your B-Greek studies.He is a French scholar so his work can also be recommended to French speaking people who don't read English but are hungry for good theological tools when studying the bible.Some of Spicq's definitions are so well written that you can take them straight to the pulpit as they are and read portions of it. Not many theological tools are as well written as that from a pastor's point of view.

I was told about this book in 1988. I'm still using it almost every week. For a pastor who tries to study the Greek NT for sermon exegesis weekly, this book gives me a quick way to understand more about textual issues and nuances of meanings that I would normally miss. One can learn a lot over time by referring to this book for 10 minutes or so for each sermon you develop...cherry picking relevant issues that relate to the text you are studying. Find the lesson to focus on in the Grammatical analysis book...then just read and reread the lesson in this book until you see clearly how it applies to your sermon (if it does). That can be done in ten minutes or less for each grammatical lesson related to a paragraph of Greek NT. Often he has 4 to 7 lessons associated with a paragraph! Each lesson varies in length from a couple lines of text to maybe a half page of stuff. References and exampls in the NT are there so you can see clearly what he is talking about. That's a lot of practical Greek training built into a sermon! If you put that into the regular mix of your sermon exegesis, you will find your confidence in things like simple prepositions and the various meanings they can be used for growing by leaps and bounds.I think every pastor who works in the Greek NT should refer to this book alongside of Grammatical Analysis by Zerwick. Gordon Fee also recommends this book in his NT Exegesis (3rd Edition) which is used in Bible Colleges and Seminaries around the world. If you haven't used this book, you need to start in my view.

Every time I see this film I am left in silence, unable to speak. It is the most powerful film I have ever seen. The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified. Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event. Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie. (I have a bachelors degree in Bible).Let me recommend this film for almost everyone. For those who are having trouble loving difficult people, this movie will change you. For those who are having trouble forgiving others, this movie will enable you. Not because of the movie itself, but the content of the script-much of it comes from the Bible and is itself exceptionally powerful.As far as the technical side of the movie. The music generally enhances every step of the 'Via Dolorosa', and the slow-motion cut ins are not over done in my view. They enable you to meditate on what is happening. It's like our souls have been marinated in the power of what Jesus did.For those who are unfamiliar...the movie takes place on the Passover Feast of the Jews. This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt. Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them. On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go. It was memorialized as the Passover Feast. The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie. One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the 'Death Sentence' of Jesus to understand.For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God. That's always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season. (unless you are under about 9 as I was saying).

This book delivers way more than one would expect. First of all it is not that long of a book. But it takes a long time to read because you cannot breeze through it. Written by a South African pastor in the 1800's, this book has a woodenness to the english that slows you down. This is good because the topic is so deep that you want to stop and pray every page or two.It leveled me to the ground about 12 years ago. It is still at the top of my list.As a pastor, I have recommended this book to many, many people. It usually changes their lives. The fruit tends to be enduring and deep.I first encountered it when I was a YWAM student. It was required reading in our discipleship school. I think this book should be read by every Christian. If you don't have a copy, buy an extra one so that you can have a loaner.

This book delivers way more than one would expect. Let me explain that. First of all it is not that long of a book. But for many people it takes a long time to read because the points he makes on every page are so convicting. Also, it is written by a South African pastor in the 1800's, and has a woodenness to the English that slows you down. This gives the topic a KJV feel to it in some places. Some people don't like that, but I found it enhanced the whole experience of reading this powerful little book. I asked a man in a church about 30 years ago why he was so short and his son was so tall (his son was well over 6'4" and he was 5'5"). He said something to me that I never forgot. He said, 'dynamite comes in small packages' so don't ever underestimate a small person. That's exactly how this book it. There is spiritual dynamite on the pages and so don't underestimate the transformational power in this little paperback (or hardback).It leveled me to the ground about 12 years ago. It is still at the top of my list.As a pastor, I have recommended this book to many, many people. It usually changes their lives. The fruit tends to be enduring and deep.I think this book should be read by every Christian. If you don't have a copy, buy an extra one so that you can have a loaner.

As a pastor who is studying and preaching from the Greek text through Revelation, and who audited Beale at Wheaton on Revelation, I find that this commentary is used on every sermon.It's a first rate commentary with opinions that true scholars and regular pastors learn to respect even if they do not agree with him on every point. Sometimes when reading Beale there are so many references to apocalyptic literature and other sources that one can get overwhelmed. Osborne doesn't give as many references, but the other reviewer is correct...he's easier to read than Beale or Aune. I have several hundred dollars of the best commentaries I could find on Revelation. This one is one of the few that almost always makes it in my book bag (and it's pretty thick). I am unwilling to go without it when I have the potential of preparing a sermon at home rather than my office.He sets apart special comments and exegetical points in shaded frames for quick reference. One time when we were discussing a particularly detailed and crucial point in class Dr. Beale excitedly said, I've got to call Osborne about this....which shows that if one of the top scholars in the world on Revelation is excited about calling Osborne...he must be great. And as I've used him, I agree. His stuff is great.When they diverge, I usually go with Beale, but Osborne makes one think carefully and helps you work through issues in a different way than Beale does. The big differences are that Osborne has smooth reading, fewer references to research on most points, but about as much material in general as Beale.Any pastor who is preaching from Revelation should refer to Osborne as well as Beale for indepth background on almost every nuance of the text one can imagine. So although I cannot say I agree with every single point in this book...it's easily a five star commentary that you need in your library and open on your desk as you research the textual issues and depths of this incredible grand finale of the bible...the book of Revelation.

This is the finest commentary on Genesis in my library. It is a 2 volume set.Hamilton deals with a wide array of issues. His work reflects later scholarship than Wenham's Word Biblical Commentary, and his conclusions are more convincing than Wenham's when they differ (in my opinion). For example, Genesis contains the Hebrew 'TOLeDOT' in 10 locations. Hamilton reviews Wenham's (and others) idea that 'TOLeDOT' in Genesis 2 is a conclusion for the first chapter. He then goes on to reject that idea because the 9 others are clearly introductions to the following material. He then goes on to explain how it should be seen as the introduction to Genesis 2:4 ff. He goes further than commentators like Waltke on this, by offering a significant grammatical point on this as well. Wenham does not talk about it at all. Wenham bases his argument on context only with a leaning towards the meaning of the words themselves. This affects how one sees the entire book of Genesis. Wenham does not see the ten divisions of Genesis. Hamilton includes the ten divisions as part but not all of his reasoning. Waltke concurs with Hamilton, and I have to say that Hamilton's argument is far superior in my view.It's not just another point in the exegesis of the book. This particular point is crucial to how you see Genesis as a whole, and its parts. It even can affect how you view the authorship of Genesis (hodgepodge or a whole composition).Unfortunately, Hamilton does not contain information that deals with chiastic and alternating structures. He should.I've found his commentary is usually full and helpful as well as readable. Every part of every verse provides reflection on the hard issues and the easy ones.I have had the feeling that I am not just reading about the bible, but am feeding on the spiritual treasures of Genesis presented by someone who loves the Word. I really appreciate the tone of this commentary.Often Hamilton gives a section called New Testament Appropriation where he cites a passage in Genesis and related passages in the NT. These are packed with comments on each relevant passage and loaded with footnotes for further study. This is extremely convenient for the preacher or Bible teacher who is dealing with these issues in the text.He does not give what is now expected in the finer full commentaries...one excursus after another. This is a disappointment. He also does not give the wealth of Chiastic and Alternating structures that Waltke gives. He does not provide any special systematic treatment of Christological passages, even though more than one book has been written on preaching about Christ from Genesis.He does give a lot of integrated and expertly cited information from Jewish literature and Ancient Near Eastern Studies. These citations seem to flow from the pen of someone who is very familiar with Ancient Near Eastern cultures and religions. I love the way he ties this research in, and even though I have personally read some of the very things he cites, I still didn't see the link the way he brings it in until I read his perspective on it and went back to review. He's very good for this sort of thing.

I'm working on a short sermon series through Luke's gospel. I have read a number of works (select portions). I think that Evans NIBC commentary brings aspects into the picture that I haven't found in the other commentaries. For example, most commentaries deal with the temptation of Christ in the wilderness and mention allusions or parallels to Israel's wandering in the wilderness, or Job's trials or Paul's affliction. It was Craig Evans that pointed out the link to Moses' forty days of fasting and then the proclamation of the law which followed that.Perhaps another commentator brings this out, but what pastor has time to read them all. The thing I like about this one is that he is to the point and he tries to bring in pertinent points that others don't always bring out.For pastors/teachers who need a commentary to supplement their exegetical work but who are under a time constraint, this NIBC series generally works really well in that role. It also works well as another view in the mix of several quality commentaries. For Luke, I have found Bock's to be perhaps the best. Even so, I am still checking what Evans says and sometimes find some nuggets worth adding to my notes. Therefore, I heartily recommend this commentary.I would like to add one caution on Evans. This is an older commentary, and he does not seem to bring out the Already aspect of the Kingdom of God as he comments on Luke. For example, he takes great care to point out that the Triumphal Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem in Luke 19 is a 'Royal Entry' with the term King specifically added by Luke to the OT quote for theological emphasis. Yet he goes on to say that because Luke omits the palm branches and other aspects of the entry that may point to the Kingdom's presence, that he has in mind only the Kingship of Jesus, but NOT the Kingdom of God. He then draws the conclusion that Luke must believe that the Kingdom is not in mind...and cites Acts 1:6-7 as his proof for this...but I contend that the Kingdom of God's nature was misunderstood by the disciples and that Jesus Christ inaugurated the Kingdom's presence when he arrived...and established it through his death, burial and resurrection even though the disciples thought he was going to overthrow the Romans. So, I do believe that Evans needs to be supplemented with a commentator who has a stronger 'Already/Not Yet' view of the Kingdom of God.Having said that, he is packs a lot of nuggets into the material he does give. For a fuller treatment of passages see Joel B. Green or if that's not enough try Darrell L. Bock's two volume set. Where Evans gives a page of material Bock gives 14 to 16 pages.None of these commentaries bring out preachable or exegetical statements on a regular basis like some commentators do on other books in this series (see Achtemeier's Minor Prophets work for a great example of preaching aids mixed into the commentary in this very same series!)Having said all of this, you can get some very good ideas for further study in a few minutes of reading on a passage. So I do heartily recommend this commentary for all pastors and bible teachers, students of the word and researchers focused on the English text of Luke.

We've had all ages of kids over since Christmas 2006 playing this game. They are laughing, gaining skill, having a blast...and getting worn out on these dance pads. It has a workout routine that is a lot of fun. The product seems pretty durable even though the kids are stomping it pretty hard.The age ranges we've had over who have loved it so much they don't want to leave it behind are 8 to 17. I'm sure older kids would love it too. DDR is fantastic. It might be THE most fun way to get in or stay in shape out there.

I purchased this book for a sermon series I'm doing on Ephesians. It was highly recommended by two friends. I amhappy with the book, but have to give it a four star ratingbecause I've found some explanations of Greek text, for examplethe Ephesians 2:1 claim that trespasses and sins were theequivalent of commission/omission do not stand up under scrutiny.The lexicons I checked and the scholars I contacted did not concur with Stott's claim. He provides no support for this popular definition of sins and trespasses. For a commentary dealing with the Greek text, I was a bit disappointed with that.This is the first time I've had this experience with Stott's stuff. The main reason I like his commentaries is that hisstuff provides good summaries that preach well.I think overall this commentary is very good, but one must check the scholarship. For Ephesians so far I've found the best onthe Greek text is FF Bruce's commentary NICNT. He rightly identifies Eph 2:1 trespasses and sins as synonyms.Out of all the commentaries I've purchased or read for Ephesians I would rate FF Bruce highest, Stott second and O'Brien third.

I think that this commentary is very much like other Stott commentaries that I have used (Ephesians & Romans). He gives great phrases for teaching and preaching. For example in chapter 1:1 he goes into detail about what an apostle was from a Jewish perspective. Then he gives a mini excursus on NT apostleship...and teaches that there can be no more apostles in any sense. He does not offer convincing evidence for his position. The problem with all of this is that none of it comes from the Galatians text he is discussing. There isn't anything in Galatians 1:1 that would tell us in any way that apostles are not for today. That sort of conclusion is not exegetical and is debated hotly in various circles. So you must watch out for Stott to give one side of a debated issue without clueing you in on the other views. So why do I rate this a four star? Why do so many people like Stott's stuff?I think that it's really good to use Stott's material for innovative and catchy phrases that summarize the terminology well. He often has an innovative outline of whatever he is teaching on. Galatians is no exception to that rule. Another thing that is great about this commentary is that it follows his matching bible study guides. So a Bible Study Leader can use Stott to start discussions, and if he has read this book, he has more meat to add to the discussions. To round out Stott, I heartily recommend the following additions.Since FF Bruce has a commentary on Galatians, I recommend his. Also Fung's NICNT on Galatians is very careful to thoroughly explore the most reasonable options and show why one is superior over the others. Both of them are really good.One more point...Stott sometimes interacts with popular pressures from different camps. For example in Galatians 1:1-2 he interacts with the radical camp and then turns to interact with the catholic theologians. For the radicals he says that Paul's apostolic authority is divine and higher than the contemporary authority they claim is equal to Paul. For the catholics, he says that apostolic succession is not a biblical concept. In these interactions he is very convincing. He provides answers for people who may be hearing things from these two popular groups that are contrary to Paul's teaching in Galatians.So for his interactions, fresh phraseology and innovative outlines, I recommend Stott heartily. Just check his exegesis...he should not be the solo commentary for a study on Galatians. If you can only get one, I recommend Fung's or Bruce's. Having said that, I will keep using Stott whenever I study Galatians. He is excellent overall. I'm grateful to have this commentary in my office.

When our son was diagnosed with leukemia four years ago, my wife was so encouraged by this CD. The song, "Every Heart that is breakin'" was one of her favorites. I got a call last week about a friend who's husband was killed in a car accident. While out ministering to the family (I'm a pastor), my wife dug up this CD and was listening to it. She was weeping as I came home.I had a chance to play this song for a grieving widow and her response to the song Every Heart that is breakin' was 'That's perfect'. So for pastors or anyone ministering to a grieving widow or widower or a suddenly fatherless child...or similar situation, this CD is worth having in your library.For anyone in grief or in a difficult situation, I heartily recommend this CD just for the song "Every Heart That is Breakin'".Of course it has many of her famous songs from the late 70's and early 80's as well and some of them are gems...like Runner or the Warrior is a Child.I know the Paris family. Twila's parents are great people. Her siblings are wonderful as well. Although I do not know Twila personally, I have to say she is surrounded by so many quality people...and I have always felt her music had a purity and spirituality to it that was rare.I recommend this CD to everyone.

After saving this review, I have tried three times to change it to a four star, but the website won't allow me to change it to a four star. Please consider this review as a four star rating.I did a sermon series through Hebrews. I was very excited to get this book, because I thought the authors approach would be fresh and interesting, providing a lot for sermon development. At first I was concurring with his thoughts, but as I continued to work on the book of Hebrews, I found other works I owned to be more helpful. As I worked on through the series, I ended up laying this one aside and turning to other commentaries. If you are like me, you don't have time to read everything on a subject, and I just found that Jewett didn't give me enough on each pericope to justify referring to this book every week.There is more to my opinion on this, but let me just say that if I were buying books for a series on Hebrews, this book would not be at the top of my list.Having said that, it is an interesting concept as Jewett explores the idea of a pilgrim's journey perspective for Hebrews.Please check my listmania on Hebrews for other suggestions on the rich book of Hebrews.

This paperback on Revelation brings in a simple and refreshing perspective on Revelation. For example he suggests that children can understand Revelation...that we need to stop 'puzzling' over Revelation and enjoy the Panoramic pictures of this book. His 'down home' encouragement is exactly what this book is when laid side by side with Beale's NIGTC Commentary on Revelation. (The NIGTC is a technically dense work with many many references to all kinds of sources for each verse).Dr. Beale (2004's E.T.S. President) recommends this book as part of his course recommended reading on Revelation at Wheaton. Of the 8 or so books he recommends, this one sports a number of great visual concepts that do empower bible teachers and pastors. As a pastor who is preaching through Revelation from the Greek text, I found his material helpful on the application side of things.For example, on the four major views on Revelation Poythress supplies a great little visual diagram of how the four views look. Just the diagram alone can help many people understand the four different view (Preterist, Futurist, Historical, and Idealist) more than most commentaries would.The weakness is that you will not have comments of substance on every question in Revelation. It's not meant to be an exhaustive commentary on Revelation.Enjoy it. It's well written and worth owning a copy.

First I would like to say that I remember this author from my undergraduate studies. He was a student at the same Bible College I attended. My general impression of him at that time was that he was the most scholarly undergrad student we had and that he had a deep spiritual fire for Jesus. As an undergraduate student he was fluent in the biblical languages. Everyone respected him. When he spoke in chapel as a student, everyone stopped to listen carefully-even the guys on the back row.A couple decades later he is an author and a well-known scholar. But I have a bias in favor of him because of my college days...so bear that in mind here.This commentary is one of my most often consulted commentaries on Matthew. It's a great companion to R.T. France's NICNT on Matthew. Bypassing some of the normal activities of a commentary, like having an outline of the text inset into the table of contents (I wish he had one actually), and moving through material in a more fluid manner (not bit by bit as most commentaries do), Craig Keener develops a rather rich assembly of resources from a very extensive list of ancient sources. He quotes extensively from ancient Jewish literature and other related sources that impact the meaning of the passage.His quotes avoid the pitfall of some commentaries (Craig avoids meaningless notes that ramble on and on about minutia) and he gives a busy pastor or teacher his opinion on how the ancient texts out there affect the biblical pericope at hand. Often he comments on a section or paragraph's theme in a relevant way.This is NOT meant to be a typical commentary. It is a commentary on Matthew, but not like what you are used to reading. This commentary does deal with a lot of technical points either in the introduction or in the text, so I don't think scholars will be disappointed-but be aware that his focus is a little more of an integrated focus.If you think of this as a specialized Jewish background of the Gospel of Matthew that is customized into a commentary, then I think you have defined this commentary. I am delighted to have this one and heartily recommend it to every bible student.

January 2012 BW 9.0 update: I developed some trouble in 2011 with my BW8. It seemed unstable. Reinstalling didn't solve the problem. I decided to buy BW9. What a huge improvement in performance AND some textual research features for anyone who does indepth exegetical work. For example, you can see and search actual manuscripts! It's just amazing to me. I have to report that I did have trouble ordering my upgrade. The system did not take my order, and I am used to ordering online. It actually hung my order up and I was left wondering if my credit card was charged or not. So I wrote an email in to a order email on their website. Unfortunately I received no reply. So after waiting about a month I decided to reorder the product. I asked them to cancel any previous order from the earlier email and/or online action I initiated. They indicated nothing was in their system. The online order probably just crashed. But the email request should have been handled in my opinion. Most of my interactions with BW have been outstanding. But as a five star review, I feel this is the one ding with them that I've experienced. My overall 5 star review remains a 5 star. AND if I could, I would give the products performance a 5+.July 2009 update: I use BW 8.0 for sermon research and deeper bible study. I sometimes use it during small group teaching to look up references quickly as questions arise. I have looked at Logos and Gramcord in depth. Let me say that I gravitate towards BW 8.0 for a number of reasons. If you want to leverage technology to quickly analyze what is going on in a passage, and you know some Greek and/or Hebrew, then this is the program for you. Free with BW 8.0 includes all the tools you need to do extensive research on the Jewish Greek literature background to the New Testament. You also have a wide array of resources to research the LXX and Early Church Fathers in Greek/English and other languages like Latin.Let me give you a case in point that I think is very relevant for exegetical claims made by some Reformed scholars when it comes to words in the Greek text. In Romans 8:29 a very popular teaching among many scholars claims that the Greek term Paul uses in this verse has a Hebrew flavor in meaning. This is then used to establish doctrine. The verse says: ESV Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.The claim is made that the term 'foreknew' (proegknow) really means to forelove and that it doesn't mean foreknow in the simple sense because the Jewish Greek use modifies it. They claim that Jewish Greek use imports the Hebrew term for love into the Greek compound verb...and that the Hebrew term 'to know' can mean 'to love' and so the Greek word 'to fore know' really means here to 'fore love'. Part of the complaint is that it cannot mean simply foreknow or that would lead to Arminianism or Universalism. So, passing comments occur in a number of Reformed commentaries on Romans or on the topic of Predistination by reformed scholars when dealing with this verse. How would anyone who is not very well versed in Jewish Greek literature know? It sounds likely. It must be true right?With BW 8.0 you can just look it up and read the sources in about 30 to 60 minutes. Simply configure tabs in the search window to access all the different resources for Jewish background studies that exist in Greek literature. For example, the LXX, the Pseudepigrapha, the Apocrypha, Philo, Josephus and then the post NT Apostolic Fathers all can be searched in morphological databases (this allows you to search a dictionary entry and find any form instantly. You can configure it to display the English next to the Greek so that if you are not good at Greek, you can check the English as well. The bottom line: in this case I was studying on Romans 8:29 there was not one instance of Jewish Greek literature that contained the claim by popular scholars. In fact, after reading all the sources for myself, I concluded that there may be a failure on the part of these scholars to check their facts. This stunned me. Some of my favorite scholars were clearly wrong on this word.It also gave me the feeling that as a pastor doing regular sermon research I now have a real tool that allows me to confirm or reject claims in scholarly commentaries and pray through the data for myself. So with BW 8.0, it has now become financially and technically feasible for a regular preacher to double check confident claims by any scholar when it comes to the background of Greek terms in the era from 300 BC through to 200 AD. The flexibility of BibleWorks 8.0 to set up custom tabs (one for each time period of Greek literature for example) gives you the power to study the Greek NT on one tab, click another tab and study the same term or a different term in the Pseudepigrapha and then another tab for the LXX or Apostolic Fathers. It's like working with tabs on a browser in Windows. Once you set it up, you can really go as deep as you like. I'm telling you it is wonderful!Another example: While studying the term for virtue in 2 Peter 1:5 I found a reference in the Apocrypha to the story about the seven brothers who were martyred during Antiochus Epiphanes IV reign of hellenization. If you are unfamiliar with this story, it is part of the Jewish background that feeds into the concept of excellence or moral excellence that Peter is talking about in 2 Peter 1. BUT it is also probably part of the background of the story where Jesus is challenged by the question about a woman who is widowed, married to six other brothers (seven in all)...and then dies with no children. The attempt to trap Jesus was heightened by that allusion. Things like this come alive. You can find these links for yourself with BibleWorks 8.0 AND you can find other passages that refer to these links. The first use in Jewish Greek literature of the term Peter uses for moral excellence in 2 Peter 1:5 appears in the account setting up the story about the seven brothers in order to inspire them to stand true to the death when the law of Moses was challenged by the Greeks. All of this and the Jewish commentary on it all is right there for your beck and call, enriching your study of the term that Peter gives by drawing out the sense that the term may include a moral fiber that stands firm to the very death of a believer (wasn't that Peter's problem in Gethsemane?). You can do these sort of things with Logos or other programs, but to get all the tools for an exhaustive study across the 400-500 years of NT background studies in place you are going to spend a lot more money. (just Philo alone is $100 with Logos).What this also opens up for a pastor, is the potential of using ancient stories that most members in a congregation have never heard before to illustrate word meaning. This can be captivating and educational at the same time (nice eh?).So if you have gone to Seminary, Graduate School or Bible College, and even know just a little Greek/Hebrew and value being able to check the background of the NT/OT as well as the early church context, then BibleWorks 8.0 may be the very best program/price combination out there. I love the product.Previous review follows:I use BibleWorks 7.0 professionally, pretty much on a daily basis. I would not want to operate without it. There are other great programs out there, but this is the one I find myself using over and over. The others sit on the shelf unused in my office.Many years ago I bought BibleWorks 3.5 and a competitive Windows based program. I ran identical searches with both programs. I found they gave different answers. Then I discovered the BibleWorks competitor had a big problem running complex searches accurately. It was disclosed in their readme.txt, but even their sales people didn't know about the bug. I ended up using BibleWorks instead. That was version 3.5 or so. The difference today in improvements over my old BibleWorks program is akin to the difference between a Model T and a Cadillac. Today's Bible Works is so much better it's amazing. I have watched the BibleWorks people roll out several versions. They always add an overwhelming list of new features that make the upgrades a sweet deal for anyone.Some of the new things in BW 7.0 (just released this year) include a newly finished diagram for every verse in the NT. All of the steps that Gordon Fee suggests in his NT Exegesis book (get it if you don't have it) are now possible in this software. I use a checklist from his book and work through it with BW 7.0 open, a word processor, and an internet browser. Everything is very intuitive. They offer training courses around the nation (see their website for dates/locations). Those courses are helpful.If you are working on a passage, you can pull up multiple versions and paste them into a word processer for formatting and printing. This allows you to highlight either in the software or with a real highlighter on your paper. You can easily mix Greek with English...and if you have people like I do who are not really good at English, paste in the Russian, Spanish, French or whatever language they need....and you can provide printed text for them to read. This can be done in seconds.The program is flexible, and easy to use.The fastest way for us to print out our Sunday Worship Service text for reading is to use BibleWorks. I pull up the program, enter the version and the reference. Paste it into my Word Processor or drag it there..and click print.One of the things that Gordon Fee (Exegesis expert) recommends is for students to diagram their text. The new diagramming canvass is great. Just insert the text. Drag and drop it into place and drag the symbols for diagramming to where they belong. That's it. For comparison, BW 7.0 now includes diagrams for every verse. If you have kids in school, they can use it for diagramming English as well-which can give them a professional look in high school papers/class assignments.With a click of the mouse you can search the lemma (root) of a word in Greek or Hebrew from Genesis to Revelation (LXX & GNT). Or Hebrew OT only. You can do almost any kind of search.I own the major competitors to this program. To use Gramcord you have to own a Mac or you can install a program that simulates Mac Operating system on your computer. The Mac feel to Gramcord has a very archaic feel to it and I never got used to it. I cannot tell if Logos is currently accurate in it's searches, so I don't know if you can trust that program to produce correct results.I've found that BibleWorks is a great program for my use.Some other things you can do: Look up all major lexicons on a word in a few seconds. Paste the results into your word processor embedded where-ever you want. Basically, you can quickly do exhaustive word studies. You can outline a passage in a word processor. Add in whatever you want and blog the results, print it or save it to your computer. You can highlight anything in any color, size or shape. Just drag, pull down the menu you want and that's it.Let me talk a bit about the BibleWorks people. They seem to have a 'we can do it' attitude. They work hard and add new features and improve existing ones. Years ago I was one of their customers who asked for diagramming. Now it is reality. And it's slick.If you are studying a passage and you are not up on all the Greek words...you can click on the flashcard module. It pulls up the passage and drills you on the words you don't know. You can configure everything on it from the amount of time a word is displayed to the fonts used or the actual definition.With BW7.0 you can compile your own version of the bible. This allows one also to have other books besids the bible added in. There are user provided modules online that include a ton of documents. Plus, the Apostolic Fathers in Greek is now available. This means you can see exactly how a word is used by the disciples of the apostles and other early church fathers. Users have added tons of other ancient books, some seem to be worth having. I now have hundreds of books in my computer freely contributed through the work of many BibleWorks users who maintain a free unofficial blog service that allows users to download hundreds of ancient books...books I've heard of and always wanted, and many books I never knew existed...apocryphal books, apocalyptic literature and a variety of language and historically vital resources. There new volumes being added all the time and the BW users who manage that entire effort are very helpful if you have a problem. That feature would cost thousands of dollars on Logos. It's all free in BW (but is not currently officially supported...it does work just fine from my experience).There are so many features in this program that I cannot review them all.I don't have time to get into the search engine and it's rich feature list. It's great. Help is right there. The resource center has a wide array of resources. It includes things like Zerwick's analysis, Word Pictures by Robertson and many other classic resources...all built in for your convenience. There are grammar paradigms/forms for refreshing the memory of almost every greek student who walked the face of the earth.Let me say this too...I took a class early this year at Wheaton College Graduate School. In the class I discovered they had a special exegetical process that included atypical symbols. With a quick check on the forum for bibleworks, I found an answer from another user that enabled me to use BW 7.0 for a customized exegetical process. Color coding and special insert symbols. It is fantastically flexible.I would not want to function without this program.Another great feature is the flashcard module now has Erasmus or Modern Greek pronunciation for each word! So if you want to learn Modern Greek pronuniation, you are off to a start for a trip to Greece because 70% of biblical Greek is used in Modern Greek.To see this, all you have to do is pull up a passage of Modern Greek and the GNT original and do a side by side highlighted comparison. That's another slick feature on this program.I'm skipping perhaps a couple hundred features and this is a pretty long article already. Perhaps the best thing about BibleWorks 7.0 is that the users forum hosted by BibleWorks has a lot of knowledgeable and active members. Almost anything you can imagine has been asked and answered about this program.For those who are new to professional grade exegesis software, there are detailed tutorials explaining every movement of the mouse. You can review them over and over until you know your stuff...or just jump in like I do. It's fairly intuitive if you have any computer sense. Once it gets beyond your insight, the user forum is excellent. Many very knowledgeable and helpful guys on there.I also have found that the grammars included in BibleWorks are helpful. For example, Futato's Hebrew grammar is built into BW and is so good that I am learning Hebrew primarily from that book digitally integrated into BW. The flashcard module allows me to drill myself in Hebrew words too. It's wonderfully simple and very helpful. The grammar even pronounces words for me by clicking on the sound icon next to words.Go for BW 7.0. You won't be sorry. Let me know you saw this review. I will help you as much as I can. Hope to see you in the BibleWorks forum.

MOst of the aspects of this film were very well done. Perhaps the best part was Knightley's role. She was excellent.I feel most of the negative critiques below this one were overly harsh. This really is a great movie...and if you have seen the previous edition (who hasn't)...then you will be disappointed the wedding scene was left out. My wife was. Yet, the interactions between key actors are very well done.The nuances with videography and music add touches that my wife and I both noticed and enjoyed. I think this one is a keeper and will watch it again sometime. Get it and enjoy it!

I have about 30 to 35 commentaries on Galatians in my office this year as I am working through the book for a sermon series (I'm a pastor). I was pleasantly surprised at the basic verse by verse exegesis of this commentary and find myself looking at it more closely than the other commentaries I have. I find a lot of scholarship has been clearly packed into each sentence he writes with clear statements he communicates crucial concepts line after line. I found some of his observations help a preaching pastor to develop better sermons. For example, an easy one is the point that when Paul says 'Grace and Peace' he is using an impartation style. The implications of that are overlooked in other commentaries I examined. Almost every nuance is helpful...as he explores the order of the Pauline verse descriptions it helped me to identify mirror like patterns in Galatians 1.I also like the way he describes things better than most commentaries. Even in the NICNT series sometimes one has too look elsewhere for preachable phraseology. But I've found that a lot of Fung's stuff will preach almost as it is.He's very good. I think that he has earned a place among the top few commentaries on Galatians written in English. I heartily recommend you get this-even over his mentor (FF Bruce) on Galatians NIGTC...which is pretty good as well. I usually go to Stott for preaching phrases, but not in Galatians. I'm sticking with Fung for now.So whether you agree with the other reviewer or not about the South Galatians theory and it's implications, the basic verse by verse exegesis is exceptionally helpful and I'm very excited to have this commentary in my library.I recommend you buy this one.

As a pastor working on sermons from the Greek text through Revelation, I've found that Mounce's NICNT commentary on Revelation is one of the best ways for me to summarize what I've read in all the other commentaries.I have to take exception to the previous reviewer regarding Mounce's commentary on Revelation-saying that Mounce doesn't declare himself on issues. I think Mounce writes with clarity...boiling down the sometimes complex arguments of the various views to a few sentences that make sense. It's surprisingly easy to understand...so good that you can actually use some of his summaries in the pulpit and not lose the average listener! That is amazing to me. He makes a judgment call, sometimes coming to a different view than most or many other commentators.For example, on the term ANGELOS (Angel) in Revelation 1:20, 2:1 and the other six churches, Mounce reviews the other positions...and then concludes that the term 'prevailing spirit' may capture the real meaning there. However, many believe that the term here means 'angelic messenger' or a real angel from heaven. I think he missed it on that point, but he knows way more about Greek than I do and I respect his position.I found that Mounce is not always complete when describing the historical situation for each verse. It's helpful to read other commentaries for background information-they all give nuggets that bring out different aspects of the historical situation. For example, Beale (NIGTC) on Revelation has more information as does Aune on Revelation. Also Osborne (Baker) is helpful too. I have perhaps about ten scholarly works on Revelation. Yet Mounce is easier for a busy pastor to read through than any of these other fine authors...even if he gives less information. (Beale is my number one pick even so). I find myself unwilling to part from my Mounce commentary. What when compared to the heavy hitting commentaries is less information, is still a lot of useful detail for any preaching pastor or bible teacher working through the text of Revelation. Plus he's really easy to understand.If you are preaching through Revelation, or writing a paper for a course, or even teaching a class on the subject...or a small group discussion, Mounce can help you. When describing the historical context of the seven churches, he sometimes strikes a lyrical cadence that is very useful. I love this commentary! What a rare flower! Get a copy if you can afford it!

My pastor told us many years ago that he reads this book about once a year. Now that I have been a pastor for 10 years, I have to say that this book is one of the great classics. Each chapter is an anointed, powerful lesson on a quality of God's nature.One way to read this book is as a devotional on your nightstand. The meditations Tozer gives are a wonderful way to go to sleep at night...pondering the incredible God we serve through faith in Christ.It is also a good tool for preaching on God's attributes as a primer for helping a church develop deeper experiences in worshipping God.The only thing I would change about this book is to cover more attributes of God...in other words...I wish he had given us more of what we have in this book...but then who could fully exhaust the glories of God?If you have never read this book, it will thoroughly bless you by helping you catch an awe of God that will change you.

In a nutshell: This commentary is by far my favorite one on Romans. As a preaching pastor who uses the Greek text for sermons, the footnotes in this volume are a God-send. He makes common sense out of the sometimes difficult to understand apparatus of the different Greek texts. At the same time Dr. Moo respectfully handles each major view all the way through the volume (yes I've read most of the book). Usually he demonstrates with clarity why he favors what view he does. If there is a tough call, he usually states that and then gives why he favors a certain view.For example, I do not agree with Moo's view on water baptism in Romans 6. However, he carefully reviews the different positions on water baptism, and presents his case, a pretty good case, directly appealing to the bible's text. If one doesn't agree with Moo, as I don't on that point, one must agree that his point is definately a reasonable view that may be correct. He's like this all the way through the commentary.Of all my commentaries on any book, this one is the best one I own (I have hundreds of commentaries). Just for his handling of chapter seven or chapters nine through eleven the volume is worth owning. So if you are working through Romans, you cannot afford to skip this volume.I took Romans in English as an undergrad student many years ago and then in 2005 I took it as a grad student with Dr. Moo via distance learning. His course at Wheaton is worth taking. I found him to be exceptionally well seasoned on every nuance of the text that I looked into. If you don't agree with his conclusions in a particular section, it is almost impossible to scoff at his view (unless one is just unreasonable). He's a careful exegete. He also heads up the doctoral program in biblical studies at Wheaton, which is pretty hard to get into from what I hear. So his scholarship is at the top generally speaking.I think he is probably one of my favorite scholars and his commentary on Romans is definitely my favorite Romans commentary. I noticed a lot of comparison between Schreiner and Moo on the comments. Since I have not purchased Schreiner yet, I cannot say anything about that point.Others I like on Romans, but are not as complete in their analysis are E. Kasemann, Peter Stuhlmacher (it's excellent, but short), Stott (for sermon phrases and presentation terminology), and James Edwards is really a great shorter commentary.

A review on Oliver B. Greene's Commentary on 1 Corinthians. It is available used. Just look around for it.This commentary captures the essence of the text in most places, although his older views of some of the controversial passages of 1 Corinthians do not hold up under scrutiny, his general work throughout this commentary is highly edifying and worth consulting. He has a vim and vigor that other commentaries usually lack. Just for this alone it's worth reading. Greene gives over 500 pages of commentary on 1 Corinthians! His general focus is exegetical and application.Let me illustrate what I see as the chief value of this commentary:On 1 Corinthians 2 he writes about verse 1 "Paul reminds the Corinthian believers that Christian Revelation owes nothing to human wisdom".He then goes on to talk about Paul's Damascus road experience and his educational background. He discusses the term mystery in the scriptures giving us a page or two for every verse. He constantly applies points to our lives today in a practical way.I used to listen to this author's radio broadcasts many many years ago. His writing reads just like his radio talks went. If you ever listened to him, you will love his commentaries. You can almost hear his raspy voice with great conviction preaching as he writes. It's quite a refreshing break from the more technical commentaries in my library!He is incorrect on a number of issues in this commentary, but that does not negate his overall contribution to us all throughout this work.

This book is perhaps a cut above some of the other BST series commentaries that I have reviewed in that Kidner deals with germane language issues succinctly. He also gives very practical tips for preaching. For example in Hosea 1 he starts out by drawing the practical analogy that we are often hurt the most by those we love. He connects this directly to the text.He also gets to crucial Hebrew textual points without adding a lot of technical detail (a delight for a preaching pastor who is not a Hebrew 'geek'). For example, he gives the very potent Jerusalem Bible (JB) translation of Hosea 1:2 by saying the "JB gives it to us with almost the merciless brevity of the original: 'Go, marry a whore, and get children with a whore, for the country itself has become nothing but a whore by abandoning Yahweh.'"He footnotes a crucial grammatical point about the Hebrew text reinforcing the structure to make the point stronger. Then he goes on to say, 'this is strong talk. And as if throwing the word 'whore' at us three times in one sentence were not enough, the Hebrew has the root not a mere three times, but four! (If you read the Hebrew text, that root appears in four of five words as a string that is much stronger than the English can portray). It's a shock factor times two!After this he challenges authors like (he doesn't mention her specifically) Achtemeier who claim Gomer (Hosea's harlot wife) probably was a cult prostitute, not a regular prostitute. Kidner claims this is not so because the Hebrew languages has a different word for cult prostitute and that Hosea did not use that word. Clearly Achtemeier does not agree.Although the lexicons seem to favor Kidner over Achtemeier, my Hebrew tutor informed me that Kidner is probably wrong on this point simply because of the customs in play in their day. So it may be helpful (as is the case in other BST volumes I have checked) to compare all exegetical points in this series with a more seasoned or accurate series like the ICC or NICOT series of commentaries.Kidner gives five pages of exegetical data and application seed ideas on Hosea 1:2-9. Since this passage is the foundation of the whole book, his treatment of it is significant.I think anyone developing sermons on Hosea or teaching a small group bible study or SS class on Hosea would enjoy this book. He doesn't waste time on minutia, deals with crucial issues, and helps to lift the language barrier between English and Hebrew for the English only reader.The real value in the BST series, and this volume delivers much in my view, is in their homiletical ideas. These commentaries are loaded with great ideas for preaching the word. Pls just double check the exegesis before running too far with his Hebrew work, because it may fly in the face of other evangelical scholars out there. In that light, I highly recommend this commentary.

A few reasons why this CD has become a classic are that it represents simplicity, raw & intimate worship with a deep theological perspective.For example, the title cut 'Hungry' is not a just worship song that is about God. It is directed to God. So as you start to sing, you find yourself calling out to God himself. It's not just calling out something nice about God. In simplicity terms we use every day are blended with the bible to help anyone connect with Jesus. The bible says taste and see that the Lord is good. This song takes that concept and turns it back into a worship song. So if you are at home or in a small group or a church service or listening to a faster version of it on the radio, the lyrics take solid biblical truth and help you pray it to God. That's part of the reason why so many people love this CD. On top of that, the musical technical quality is excellent.I would recommend it without hesitation. It also makes a great gift for anyone who is seeking God.

I just saw a preview of the coming Narnia movie. Immediately I had flashbacks to the most powerful series of books I've ever read. About 25 years ago I started reading the first of the Chronicles of Narnia. By four in the morning I was done. I couldn't put it down. Day and night I couldn't stop until I had devoured all of them....and I'm not a big reader. I was in my freshman year of college. Most of my kids have read them as well and we have even read some of them in the living room as a family together.These books are great fiction. If you decide to decode them, there are many great theological themes hidden in these delightful fictional stories about other worlds and creatures alien to earth.Since Narnia is coming out in December...a high end version, I think ya gotta read these before December. Then when you see the movie you can experience even more because you have an imagined insight into all of it already.Only one other book in all my life kept me up unable to go to sleep because I had to know what happened next. This is a fantastic series. If you don't own it, I think you will be very happy with a copy of each one.Did you know that regarding the first volume, 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' that CS Lewis had a real wardrobe that was the inspiration for this movie? Wheaton College has it on display in Wheaton, Illinois. It is inside a special dedicated library to seven great classic authors...one of whom is C.S. Lewis. Lewis and Tolkien and Sayers...all incredibly great authors from the 20th Century. I think of all the great books Lewis has written, this series is by far the best selling and most influential of his works. Great fun, and well thought out at the same time!

I was pretty stunned to see a very negative review on this commentary, because it is probably my favorite commentary so far in the Word Biblical Commentary series. Here are some reasons why I like this one.The author does know his stuff. He knows the gospel of John and the book of Revelation (having written a unique and worthy contribution to Apocalyptic studies). In this volume on 1, 2, 3 John he really does blend help for a pastor who is preparing sermons into the mix of technical language about Greek words and nuances in the text. I think this is the my favorite WBC volume because I have found more than one inspiring insight (the key word is inspiring here) on the same verse! I'm sure some of the volumes in WBC series are like this, but it seems like I always draw the dry ones (that's just my perspective).After reading the Pillar, NIBC, Hermeneia, and several other commentaries on 1 John 2:1 & 2 last week, I was so refreshed when I finally read Smalley's overview. His was better than all of the others. It made sense and grasped the crucial issues and pulled them together so I could fairly quickly meditate on some preaching points I had already come up with from my own study. So many other commentaries lost me. Smalley hit the heart of the matter.As an example, if you study the hot topic of 'propitiation' or 'expiation' that comes up in this passage, I think you will be convinced by Smalley of not only his position on this term in 1 John 2:1-2, but also of it's practical preaching impact. Here is a bit from his book to help you see what I mean.From page 40:Perhaps we should not use Paul to interpret John. Nevertheless in 1 John 2:2 (cf. 4:10) both senses of (ilasmos) also seem to be present. Jesus is regarded in this passage as a heavenly intercessor (v 1), pleading the cause of the sinner and asking for his pardon. He does this, and can do it effectively because he is righteous, and is 'himself' (autos) the offering (not the offerer!) for our sins (cf. v 7b). To this extent God is the object of the saving action. But he is also the subject, since in v 9 we learn that the forgiveness and purification of the sinner ultimately stem from the Father: he is righteous, and on the basis of the Son's offering he will forgive our sins. Here, then, is not contradiction but complementarity. John is declaring that the source of the offering is God the Father, but that the means are to be found in God the Son, and our translation, 'atoning sacrifice' attempts to capture both senses. In his life, but supremely in his death and resurrection, in the 'entire work of Christ' (Dodd, 27) salvation (initiated by God) is achieved for the believer....he goes on to cite more scholars and add on more points...but I hope you see the gist of his work here.Personally, I had read through several others on this very verse and was frustrated until I read Smalley. He did a great job here. He ties together major issues in single sentences that represent a depth of study sometimes on each phrase in the sentence. This commentary has actually made it into my backpack for transport from home to my office (I only use my top books for that-because who wants to lug a lot of books around every day?). None of the others used 'intercessor' as the preferred translation for the function of Jesus in this passage, yet it makes the most sense to me. His overview of 'ilasmos' was also easier to follow than almost any other I read, except for Vaughan's short study guide that is out of print now (it's worth getting if you can find a copy-but it is a lot shorter and not designed for scholarly research, only pastoral).I really love this commentary and highly recommend it!One criticism that I hope they have fixed in the new version. Some segments of Smalley's treatment are so long that it is almost impossible to find a specific verse. Unbelievably there are no verse by verse markers that are set apart for the reader who wants to look up what he says about a specific verse! This has a net result of making the commentary worthless if you don't have time to sift through a 40 page section looking for a Greek phrase that is simply italicized. Sometimes common sense for the user is overlooked by the editors of technical books.My suggestion is that you put a sticky flag by the spot you are working on once you find it, lest you incidentally close the book and then have to search all over again!!

In my view some of the reviews are a bit hyped up. One is far too negative. This is a really good book aimed at bringing up the integrity factor for corporate leaders. We all know this is a problem.I think Dr. Cloud has offered up a number of great concepts in a very readable form that will help many CEO's 'get it'. Many of his illustrations bring a sense of healthy reflection and conviction to the reader. Many (but not all) of his illustrations feed the concept he is making well. I found myself agreeing with him because of the pure logic of his points (over and over).A few problems some of my buddies pointed out with this book are:He has redefined the word integrity to include a lot more than the word normally means. The problem with this is that many readers will tend to forget his nuanced definition over time and therefore may forget what he is saying they need to do. Whenever someone takes a common word and expands it's definition to mean more than the dictionaries give for that word, we risk cultivating a short term memory of the concepts given.For myself, I think I found nagging questions left unanswered in my mind.How does he know these are the keys? What has research shown? What are the real priorities of a great or successful leader?I think the research I am aware of points to different factors, and this is why I was a little unconvinced that he has hit on 'the key' for success. One can have integrity and still not be a great leader. Leadership and integrity are two different things. To bring success to a corporate organization requires more than integrity. It requires inspiring and equipping leadership. This is the 'inspirational factor'. Hasn't research proven these are keys that cannot be overlooked for success? I think so. I think that integrity in the soul of a powerful leader then becomes inspiring, partially because of the integrity, but also because of the leadership and competence of the leader.So I found myself asking the question...why has he chosen these things. He says that he chose them because they occured to him in a conversation. That was unconvincing for me. Now the points he makes seem really important, but how do we know that they are really the keys for success that he claims they are? Surely some studies could be developed to bear this theory out or to show if it needs adjusting. Having said all this, Integrity is a really good book. It's packed with great points and will help you tremendously.So I would suggest that this book be read as it really is, a proposal on what we need to bear in mind for success in our ventures. With that in mind, I think this book is very helpful, it is very creative and it is fun to read. He challenges us in six essential areas that all feed into integrity in one way or another. One of his concepts is that success requires us to finish well. Another one is that we must connect well with others and gain their trust. The intrinsic logical quality of the points is as solid as it can get. This book is also packed with a steady stream of great illustrations. If you are a reader who loves illustrations, you will absolutely love this book.I think this book is good for owners, presidents of corporations or managers of people in various settings.I highly recommend Integrity for developing great leadership talent in churches as well. There are a lot of great ideas in this book that any trainer of leaders can use. I hope you enjoy it thoroughly. I certainly have.

If you are a student taking Acts or Luke-Acts in an undergrad or grad class, you really cannot afford to ignore this book. If you are teaching a bible class on Acts or Luke-Acts, this book is packed with goodies that will help you. If you are a pastor preaching through Acts or Luke-Acts this volume is surprisingly helpful. (that's what I am doing...preaching through Acts).For example, Witherington gives a 35 page bibliography with all kinds of books and articles on Acts that give you more if you need or want it. In his 102 page introduction to Acts he deals with everything from the symmetrical balance of the book with Luke (well illustrated...and photos of those illustrations are really easy to find online), all the way to the hermeneutical application of Acts in contemporary theology.His bibliography and introduction alone are probably worth the price of the book.I have found in my limited research in Acts (I have only had an undergrad course in Acts and then done my own studies for sermon prep)...but I've found that Witherington adds helpful insight in his textual exegesis. I think so far I like Marshall and Witherington's stuff the best. I only wish Bock was done with his Acts BECNT...but it won't be on the market until I am done with my Acts series...such is life.After I spent all my book money on Acts books, I had one regret. I wish I had purchased Witherington. I interlibrary loaned it instead. I did that because one time I borrowed a Witherington commentary on another book, and ended up not really using it much. But this one of his is far superior in my view. I don't know why, but I suppose another reviewer who said this is is best work may be correct? It's over 850 pages of well organized and very helpful material.His stuff is fresh and carefully nuanced. I feel he complements Marshall's commentary well.Here is his comment on part of Acts 1:8, which some believe references Rome in the phrase 'end of the earth'."...vs. 8 is seen as to a certain extent to be programmatic for Acts. Yet it is possible to see this verse as programmatic without identifying Rome with the ends of the earth, since Acts 28 is an intentionally open ended conclusion. It is programmatic in the sense that it alludes to a worldwide mission, and probably also to a mission to both jew and gentile in the Diaspora, not that it alludes to Rome."This net effect is slightly different than Marshall's and in my view makes one pause and truly reflect. Acts 1:8 and it's meaning has been the subject of many dissertations...and I have to say that Witherington's perspective was fresh and perhaps somewhat convincing.This also gives you a feel for how he handles most situations in the book. Although he did not interact in 1:8 on why he feels the 'end of the earth' cannot be Rome as much as I wanted(see Marshall for that)...he does give you his view and some support for why he likes it.Overall I would encourage the use of his commentary as one of your top two or three on Acts. It's an A plus work in my view. I wish I owned a copy for myself. Buy this one if you have funds to work with!Also worth noting is the fact that C.K. Barrett & Joel Green endorse this particular commentary!

I was so surprised to see so many negative reviews of this commentary which I have fallen in love with, that I decided to write a review myself.First of all, Waltke's command of Hebrew and the decision to bring out certain aspects of the Hebrew text is selective, not exhaustive. For example, he does not cover every nuance of the Hebrew text in a verse, but does cover significant issues especially with an eye towards exegetical work (so it's a great tool for pastors-cutting through the chaff and getting to the kernel of the issue). Let me illustrate by looking at Waltke's coverage of 'Book 1 of 10 in Genesis'. In Genesis 2:4a (pg 83) he says : "This the account" [toledot] (sorry I cannot make the Hebrew transliteration look like his typesetting). This word is the signal marker for the beginning of each of the ten books of Genesis. Toledot, from the root yld, meaning "to bear children" here signifies "what is produced or brought into being by someone." It is the nominal form of the root, meaning "descendants." The account pertains to what the cosmos has generated, not the generation of the cosmos.If you desire more on this, you will have to read someone like Victor Hamilton's NICOT or any number of fuller technical works on Genesis. But for the pastor preparing a sermon, he boils it down to the essentials without TMI (too much information).For each book in Genesis (he sees 10) Waltke follows a pattern that I find refreshing to read in comparison to fuller commentaries. He starts out with a section called "Theme of Book 1" or 2 and so on. It is a short summary in normal language of that part of Genesis. Then he gives an outline of the book. He breaks it down into Acts, Scenes and Epilogues. This is very logical and consistent and brings out the literary structure of Genesis in a way that really connects well with everyone I've been teaching so far. That's very helpful from a pastors point of view.Then he does a broad segment called 'Literary Analysis of Book 1'. He covers a bit on Genre, structure and plot, escalation, characters, conflict, irony and innertextuality. After all of this he gives a segment called 'Exegetical Notes to Book 1' In this he gives cogent comments for each part of each verse, sometimes focusing on significant words, such as 'Adam' in Genesis 2:7 with quick overview of the play on words in the Hebrew text and some well polished phrases to sum it up in English (a lot of his stuff is ready made for preaching). The format is pleasant to read for any regular person, not packed with lots of parenthetical phrases or Hebrew, Greek, Latin fonts. Everything is transliterated and smoothly presented.He has everything organized by Book, Act, Scene. If that is confusing, matching scripture references are retained next to those, and there is a contents table at the front of the book for anyone who is a bit confused by that arrangement. I found it very helpful to use.Anyhow, after his section on Exegetical Notes, then he has a major segment that I believe will tempt some pastors to skip to this part immediately. It is his segment called Theological Reflections on Book 1 (or 2 or whatever book he is on). He takes crucial theological concepts like 'Second Adam' and gives the major cross links with enough food for thought to get any Bible teacher moving into a major spiritual treasure trove.After all of his Theological Reflections (which I never find in regular commentaries), then he also offers a segment called Excursus. On Book 1 it is Genesis Genealogies.I think some of the criticisms of this commentary that are on this website, reflect the hopes and needs of a more scholarly approach than the target of this commentary is intended to assist. This book is a Gold Medallion Award Winning book. The back cover attempts to posit the book as a good tool for everyone from pastor, to scholar, to student, to Bible-lover. I'm not sure scholars or Graduate students will like this tool as much as the heavier duty commentaries out there. But I absolutely love this commentary. I'm very glad that I decided to purchase a copy, and I urge pastors and Bible teachers who have an eye for bringing the text into the hearts of people everywhere to use this commentary in your research of the text.Overall Waltke gives about 30 pages of information for Genesis 2:4 through the end of chapter 4. Comparing this to Victor Hamilton's NICOT with 92 pages for the same text, and you can see why I call this a 'shorter commentary'. However, Waltke is extremely helpful, particularly for busy pastors and teachers who have to prepare messages week in and week out and draw out not only accurate exegetical thought, but relevant theological and practical application from the text.Other resources: I would also suggest Hamilton's two volume set NICOT or Wenham's Word Biblical Commentary (2 volumes) on Genesis for the fuller treatment that is sometimes needed on parts of the text. I really love Sidney Greidanus on "Preaching Christ from Genesis" for developing exegetical sermons from Genesis.

If you have a friend or family member who loves horses, this is the kind of book they can use as an interesting reference/coffee table style book. It is oversized, with lot of quality photos. I think the thing I enjoyed most about this book was the nuggets of historical information on how some breeds developed. Demonstrating how the Vladimer breeds were linked to the Clydesdales with dates and names of breeders gives people who are doing research enough to get started.In my view most of the photos were beautiful.This is a great book.

I pastor a church (10+ yrs now) about 2 hours from Wheaton College where Beale currently teaches. I audited his Spring 2006 course on Revelation in Greek. I have to say that the man is on fire for God's word. He's got a contagious zeal for the book of Revelation. We had a Greek student (from Greece) in class and visitors from Greece. Apparently they like him a lot.His exegetical method weighs heavily on a unique approach that includes a relatively rare Discourse Analysis process that Wheaton and about 6 other schools now teach in their Biblical Interpretations Courses. I think someone at Fuller developed it. The Discourse Analysis process is a nice addition to the regular NT Exegesis that Gordon Fee has outlined for everyone in "NT Exegesis". It seems to help the students catch the flow of the text and to connect ideas in a more complex and systematic way than a regular flow analysis.The linkages to the OT Prophetic books are overwhelming. Beale literally drips with quotations...his live course is about the same as the book. Just compare the quotes on one of his pages to any other commentary and you get way more for your money with Beale.If you are preaching through Revelation, get Beale and Poythress (The Returning King). I recommend Poythress' outline for a sermon series...and Beale for more exegetical tips and references than you could possibly study for a typical sermon in a week. If you don't know Greek, then Poythress will really help you. His outlines preach well. My main criticism of Beale's work is that his Exegetical Summaries for each section sound very much like a summary that a scholar who does not have to speak to regular folks very often would give. It's not preachable...you will have to rework it to keep people with you if you are preaching. That's why Poythress is great...he gives preachable phrases that harmonize well with Beale's material.I think a reviewers' criticism of Beale's failure to interact as clearly with the Preterist is accurate. I don't think Beale needs to interact with them as the reviewer claims. Beale's reasons for rejecting the Preterists approach are solid and difficult to get past (he convinced me). For example, he sees a problem with substituting a world-wide judgement with what happened in Jerusalem. He doesn't think the text warrants that sort of conclusion. He sees a problem with denying a phsyical resurrection. Because of these reasons, (and he has others listed in his book as well), he chooses to interact with the Premillenial view more.I think another book that must be recognized by Revelation students is Regnum Caloreum (see my review on that). He also interacts a lot with Osborne. He recommends Regnum Caloreum and Poythress among other commentators. He seems to interact the most with Mounce, Osborne, Aune, Smalley to name a few.I think that the argument one reviewer criticizes on 'show' in Revelation 1:1 is convincing (the other reviewer says it is confusing...but it really is quite simple) when we look at the useage of 'SEMAINW' throughout the NT-and the stuff of Revelation itself. One clear example of this is the famous use of the term in John 3:14-16 where Jesus interprets the symbol from the desert story about the serpent on a pole being lifted up to provide healing for all who look on it. I cannot recall if Beale uses that exact illustration, but that is the sort of thing he does throughout this book. Sometimes you do have to read slowly to really grasp what he is saying...because he's quite technical.Also-Beale makes a case for a strong link to Daniel. He wrote a book about this. Really his case in the NIGTC Revelation rests on that as well. He builds a very strong case for tying the book of Revelation to the Daniel 2:29-45 dream story about Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel. He shows that phrase in Revelation 1:1; 4:1, and 22:6 'hA Dei Genesthai...' is found only in Daniel 2:28/29 Theo and Daniel 2:45. This grammatically points Revelation 1:1; 4:1 and 22:6 to the dream Daniel interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar...and is therefore an interpretive key to Revelation. The Kingdom which Nebuchadnezzar sees starting during the reign of the Roman Empire Kings (if we follow the typical view on that dream)...is that the Kingdom of God which will never end is NOT something of the future only...it is something that has started...inaugurated by Jesus Christ Himself and will ultimately culminate in the justice of all wrongs and the new Jerusalem/new community.So Beale really is laying out a case for an "Inaugurated Kingdom" which began in the first century...and is prophetically and apocalyptically portrayed in Revelation. This "Inaugurated Kingdom" is expanding and will never be overthrown.The densely packed inferences to OT and Jewish apocalypic literature reinforces the fact that John is portraying the coming Kingdom has now come. The grammatical links to Daniel 2 matching the beginning and end of a story has a similar feeling the the phrase 'In the beginning'...which reminds the reader who knows the bible of two passages...Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1. The fact that there are connections between those two passages should not be lost. Similarly there are links between Daniel 2 and Revelation...not only in the verses quoted...but throughout the entire book. Revelation 1:1, 4:1 and 22:6 all point to Daniel 2:28/45 in the exact way that John 1:1 points to Genesis 1:1. The three word phrase is a direct quote. In Revelation 1, 4 and 22 these are the only places in the entire LXX/GNT where the phrase is quoted from Daniel 2.I think if you read him with a hungry and open heart you will catch fire for the most complex and detailed work of the New Testament...the book of Revelation.Beale's capturing of extensive extrabiblical references to support the inferences from OT scripture is also overwhelming.He contends, successfully, in my view, that the OT is consistently interpreted with the same hermeneutic that is recommended today. He's very good. I have to say that he is a scholar's scholar. Tough to disprove and no one can ignore him on the book of Revelation and maintain a convincing argument. Many fail to convincingly refute him. Many of his points are overwhelmingly convincing...some are not as powerful, but his overall perspective won over every single student in our class (that I could see) and there were some of the sharpest students I've ever sat with in that class. The material in this book is essentially what we studied...so I would not be surprised if you are not stretched beyond normal for a commentary of this sort.You will use it over and over if you buy it. I heartily give this one a five star rating.

This is probably my favorite book on leadership issues. First, it lays you out...Gunderson draws you in with a great story that is interesting and then drops the bomb...the point that brings conviction of a character defect.As a pastor who has been training leaders for years, this is a GREAT book!. It's not at all like other leadership books. If you are studying leadership issues, read this book!He starts out not with the popular definitions of leadership that Maxwell and others use...like 'leadership is influence'. He starts with Jesus' definition of leadership...that if you want to be a great leader you must be a servant of all. He breaks down the etymology of the Greek word for servant in that verse and applies the etymology of that word in a story like fashion. It is possible to dive into the land of etymological fallacies when one does this, but I don't think that Gunderson commits that sin. He's careful to say that the word servant shares similar roots...but never crosses the line of etymological fallacy.(See Exegetical Fallacies by D.A. Carson if you aren't sure what I'm talking about-it has to do with popular writing and preaching that abuses language components in Greek to make fine sounding arguments). I think that Gunderson has managed to use language components well withough violating grammatical/lexical rules. Very well done!!There is depth of thought and enjoyable reading all blended together. It's like sitting by a fire listening to great stories which have even greater points to them.I thought the one reviewer who kinda blasted this book had some good points, but really did not give a high enough rating for this wonderful little book...that has helped me in leadership issues more than any other book I own...including all of the fine Maxwell materials I own.This is one for leaders to use in training other leaders.

Simple and to the point for anyone who does not read Greek and wants to get an historic scholar's viewpoint on the text of Ephesians. F.F. Bruce, one of my all time favorite scholars, gives an entertaining introduction to the book of Ephesians and then goes into a verse by verse expository discussion. When he mentions Greek words, which is not that often, he gives the transliteration, not the Greek letters, so it is easier for anyone who is not a Greek reader to grasp what he is saying. In fact, the non Greek reading audience is his target in this commentary.Originally written for a publication that was cancelled mid-stream, Revell agreed to publish this volume. In essence he deals with all the elements of proper exegesis but in regular English. So if you have not been trained in how to interpret scripture before you apply it, this volume kind of walks you through those steps. Or if you will, he gives you the results of his steps.There is no application per se. This is not an application commentary. It is an effort to unlock the meaning of the words and phrases in the epistle to the Ephesians.Let me quote a bit of Ephesians 1:6 comments so you get the gist of this volume.'to the praise of the glory of his grace...'the multiplication of gentival phrases like 'the praise of the glory of his grace' is a noteworthy feature of the style of this Epistle, especially where Paul wishes to emphasize the superlative majesty of God's grace and glory and wisdom and power.Every phrase in every verse has something like this or a comment on the parallel equivalents in the rest of the NT. It's simply a very basic textual aid to help you study. If you went to Bible College or Seminary or you haven't, and you are not in the habit of dealing with the text before you try to apply it, this little volume will help you do that very thing in Ephesians. Therefore I give it a 4 star!Book Review: FF Bruce's "The Epistle To The Ephesians" 1961 published by Fleming H. Revell Company and reprinted 1974If you want to get deeper into Ephesians I also recommendThe Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians (New International Commentary on the New Testament)andThe Letter to the Ephesians (Pillar New Testament Commentary)

This book is not exactly what one would expect. It's more of a realistic look at funny and heart warming comments children probably have really made about their Dads. As a father of five, I know that kids are completely unpredictable. There is an element of surprise in some of these comments. Sometimes positive, sometimes backhanded humor. (I think the one star reviewer was overly negative...ironic considering his comments).One page has this one it..."I love him very much. If he raises my allowance, I will love him even more" Seth.Some of the comments are pretty funny. Some were not. The book doesn't bill itself as humor only...but just about kids and their Dads. So you get all kinds of things.It's a different kind of book and I'm glad my kids gave a copy to me for Father's Day. I hope you enjoy it.

This is a short, but helpful commentary on each of the 12 Prophets of the Old Testament, or as many call them, the Minor Prophets. In the 1980's this was a textbook for a bible college class I took on the Minor Prophets. It is easy to read, accurate in summarizations and helpful for the preacher or bible teacher who is looking for nuggets to share with others.For example, regarding Micah, which I am currently focused on, Jack Lewis points out that Micah deals not with international issues (as Micah's contemporary Isaiah did), but he deals with a unique blend of social and moral issues. Some of these issues overlap with Hosea and Amos. Nevertheless, Lewis has a way of helping you capture the picture of what is going on here.His commentary is much thinner that Achtemeier (get Actemeier on the minor prophets if you don't have it), but still I find him very helpful and worth consulting.

Without wasting time on minutia that doesn't matter, Carr gets to the chase of the issue at hand over and over again throughout this commentary. His material is readable, yet it reflects command of all the issues scholars deal with that seem to matter most. It is a lot smaller than my full commentaries on Song of Songs, but it is still one that I refer to and am usually not disappointed with his review of things.Here are a few examples of what I mean.On the dating of the Song of Songs, Carr surveys the major views on the dating of Song of Songs, touching on the concept that more critical scholars hold to dating it to 3rd or 4th century B.C., gives their reasons for this view and the basic criticism of the view (parts of Song of Songs have been discovered in Qumran-and some language is clearly much older). He also covers the idea that some scholars date Song of Songs to the second or third millenium basically because some similar love poetry existed in that time period and explains why it is probably not the answer. He goes on and lays out a view that it may have been written in the time period close to Solomon because of specific grammatical terms that are used in Song of Songs (these terms are transliterated and explained). He covers a range of issues in this 1984 (first edition) copy that include ancient near east literary review, comparison with Hebrew language and it's development, references to Aramaic, Ugaritic, and an overall sense is given when reading him that Carr knows his stuff. He refers the reader to other larger treatments of the subject at hand. BTW-the reviewer on Amazon here who says 'we know now that Song of Songs' was written in the third or fourth century is writing from a narrow perspective and is betrayed by a bias towards scholars who may have a difficult time harmonizing their view with some of Carr's observations. To review Carr, criticize him for his dating issue, but not deal with his reasons for rejecting the view wasn't very good in my opinion and prompted me to write my review.Another example of Carr: He gives the four major views of Song of Songs: Allegory, Typology, Drama, Natural. He basically says- the book is about what it seems to be about. He takes a more literal view of everything, and skillfully interprets rather difficult terms throughout the book. Carr gives about 14 pages of material with a well written summary of each of the four views. I think he defends his view well, and anyone who is a thoughtful and open reader will have to dig deep to challenge him. In my view, he's a good summary of authors like Longman and Hess (both have fuller commentaries on Song of Songs worth owning).If you lay open a copy of the Song of Songs, read it through, then look at Carr on anything that seems unclear, he is very helpful, yet can get technical without wasting a lot of time.His analysis of the structure of the book is as follows:1:2-2:7 Anticipation2:8-3:5 Found, and Lost - and Found3:6-5:1 Consummation5:2-8:4 Lost - and Found8:5-14 AffirmationTechnical and very important terms:Take Song of Songs 5:4. Watchman Nee identifies the hand in 5:4 as the 'nail pierced' hand of Jesus. The same hand that held the head of the woman earlier in the book. Jeanne Guyon cites Job 19 in referencing the 'hand of God' dealing with resistance.Carr takes a more natural approach admitting 'yad' normally means hand, but then goes on to remind us that 'yad' means pillar in 1 & 2 Samuel and Isaiah (1x in each book). These stone pillars are rounded at the top and were worship devices. The pillars were a 'phallic representation' that sets up the next thing in the book. Without repeating his argument, he basically says these verses are about the couple having sex and that the word 'yad' is a euphemism for the male sexual organ based on ancient context, culture, religious use of the word 'yad' in the bible and the natural or literal reading of the text.This is typical of Carr.Personally I find any commentary of Song of Songs that fails to take into account the style and linguistic approach of similar material from the ancient world, to be unconvincing. I do think that we ought to bear in mind the New Testament clearly argues that marriage is a reference to Christ and the Church. I think that ought to drive us to see parallels and meaning in the Song of Songs. But we ought to be careful that we don't end up sexualizing our view of the Church and Christ. Therefore, analogies shouldn't be pushed too hard or in too much detail in my view.This doesn't negate the interesting and sometimes well thought out views of authors who allegorize or use typology throughout. Some of their thoughts are noble and can be very helpful. But the method of handling scripture they employ is difficult to defend, unless the reader has a personal revelation from the Lord as some of these authors claim they have had personally.I think it's very important to listen to the voices that have sought to find Christ in the pages of Song of Solomon. Many who write on this topic today (see Mike Bickle as an example) have acknowledged the literal or natural view in the introductions of their writings. Yet, the grasp of ancient context must not be abandoned when so much scholarship has given us a better understanding of things today than were held by students of the bible 3 or 4 centuries ago.So if you are going after the true message of the Song of Songs, I would encourage you to use Carr. He's well written and interacts with ancient literature in a way that allows us to see his key reasons for the decisions he makes with the meaning of critical nouns in this book. That can turn the entire meaning on it's head, and so careful attention to the intended meaning of the nouns is crucial.

This book tells the true story of an early 20th century missionary to India who gave himself to prayer so much so that he became nicknamed the 'apostle of prayer'. John Hyde story amazed both my wife and I and left us with a deep passion for prayer.This is one of the few books on prayer that has affected people for over 50 years. I think you will be changed by it and highly recommend it to you.

As I have been preaching through Exodus, I've learned to turn to this resource early in my readings. This is because Enns is excellent in the way he handles application. He weaves NT citations into the application rather well. However, I've found myself wanting more than he gives in this part of his commentary each time I've used this book. Please let me explain. (I struggled between a 3 & 4 star for this book...)Basically I believe it's a very good commentary, but could be fuller in it's handling of the NT applications related to the passage and that there should be more interaction with ancient near eastern parallels to the objects mentioned in Exodus.For an example, let me cite Exodus 34:29-35, the section that covers Moses' veil. This passage is commented on with an application to the superiority of the New Covenant by Paul in 2 Corinthians 3. However, I think he misses Paul's perspective in 2 Corinthians when he says that it is "odd, to say the least, that Paul's understanding of the significance of the veil in Exodus seems to be to prevent the people from seeing the full glow of the radiance:". I think that Paul is not looking at this account from Moses' perspective as Enns contends, but from the perspective that the law of Moses is the covenant of 'death' and 'condemnation'. Paul did not miss the fact that Moses' account talks about the veil being used to prevent the people from seeing the full glow of the radiance of his face (2 Cor 3:7 Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, 8 will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?). Enns doesn't mention this, oddly!In fact I was left disagreeing with his conclusions. I think he misses the spiritualization that Paul draws out from the passage when Paul then goes on to talk about the veil over the hearts of the Jews who read Moses to this day. He presupposes and states that Moses goes out to the tent of meeting to obtain another 'dose' of God's glory. His arguments were unconvincing and didn't seem to fit the text I have studied in some cases.I feel that the New Testament passages that comment on the text of the Old Testament portion at hand ought to have a fuller handling in the NIVAC series than I usually find. I think with Enns it's spotty. Usually I'm very blessed by what I find in this volume, but sometimes left wanting.He combines 35 through 40:33 with 25 to 31. I don't like that and would prefer to see a separate chapter for 35-40. Applications abound from that section, and can be drawn out in many relevant ways (seeGod's Empowering Presence: The Holy Spirit in the Letters of Paulfor some examples.For great material on the ancient near east parallels in Exodus, I highly recommend the newGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy (Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary)which ought to be on every pastors shelf! The idea that the term in the Hebrew 'qaran' basically means 'to have horns' and the fact that an ancient Cylinder seal picturing two 'gods' with horns on their helmets and light emanating from their shoulders in near east antiquity is relevant to this passage as a potential interpretive key. Although Enns connects the translation of 'qaran' to Medieval artistry showing Moses with horns, he does not identify the fact that ancient artifacts depict deity with horns and radiant light eminating from their bodies. And so he dismisses the horn theory relevancy without dealing with the concept that Moses may have had a sort of divine presence as a result and that his skin may have been hardened to the point of even looking like horns. Or that the text could be making a word play intentionally to allude to this topic! This is surprising since John Walton, editor of the ZIBBC, was a consulting editor on this volume!This illustrates a weakness I feel this commentary has. It does not interact enough with the ancient near east background of the Old Testament for my tastes. I love commentaries that take us into the ancient world where 'regular folks' don't know how to dig up the relevant artifacts. I wish this one did that!On the section about the Tabernacle, Enns does some interesting things. He brings out the concept of 'sacred space', which is perhaps one of the most important concepts for understanding Exodus!And he discusses the NT application that the Church is the temple of the Holy Spirit...therefore sacred spaces are all around the world today. But he misses the other NT application about divisiveness (1 Cor 3).When he talks about the Tabernacle in his application section, he oddly remains Old Testament in his language by talking over and over about 'going to church'! The problem with this is that we, the believers, in the New Covenant are the 'temple of the Holy Spirit. The church building is never connected to the Tabernacle concept in the Old Testament. It is a common error to make this leap and I think demonstrates a lack of depth of thought when it comes to the application of one of the most critical concepts in Exodus!We as the church are the temple of the Holy Spirit. So we do not 'go to church'...per se...we take the church to the church building or where-ever we corporately go as a group. And of all the passages to bring out this point...this one is it! The 'sacred space' OT Tabernacle which was a physical structure has now become the 'people of God's Kingdom'. Maybe I'm making too big of a point about this, but it seems to me an important point for so many Christians who think of their church building as a sacred space, but their own bodies as their own space. We must start seeing the church body as the temple of the Holy Spirit and we must stop being divisive in our mentality. It is the perfect place to bring in Paul's argument against divisiveness in 1 Cor 3!That's what I mean when I say that I have been left wanting several times in this commentary. Yet, many of his points are excellent and worth meditating on.He returns to Genesis in his final discussion of the Tabernacle/Temple theme, and that is good, but I would prefer to see something tying in to the future eschatological hope of full face to face fellowship with God (Rev 21...God and the Lamb are the temple in the New Jerusalem). That takes the spiritualization of the Tabernacle/Temple theme to it's ultimate conclusion in scripture that there will be NO TEMPLE...and we shall dwell with God directly! It's certainly a fulfillment of the passages in Exodus...and the hope of face to face fellowship with our God should be a hope that drives us to purify ourselves!None of that is discussed, although he does an excellent job of bringing in the application of 1 Corinthians 6 dealing with cutting off sexual immorality.In summary this is a good commentary, just make sure you have other ones you are using to supplement it for Exodus studies! I give it a four star.

My Hebrew tutor turned me on to this book. It is really good. It's concise, covers the Greek and Hebrew, and very easy to use. Included are Strongs and BDB codes with page numbers for the larger lexicons. So if a lexicon has a long entry this tool gives you the part of the entry to go to, a nice time saver.I'm a big fan of BibleWorks 7,0, which has all of these things digitally sortable, but for a manual option, this book at only $12 is a great deal and small enough to carry next to your bible!It's a wonderful idea and I heartily recommend it.

As I work through Isaiah, I have come to appreciate this work more and more. Motyer observes and explains literary artistic value in the text with a minimum of words. He also gives bits on textual criticism, but I find they are sometimes harder for me to grasp what he is referring to unless I have dug into the textual problem already.But the heart of this commentary is not about literary design or textual criticism. The heart of this commentary is about explaining in a well reasoned way the basic exegetical idea paragraph after paragraph with references to related issues sprinkled throughout the commentary.One negative is that the format of the text is condensed in my view and therefore a little less comfortable to read than say the NICOT or NIVAC formats.This past Sunday I worked on Isaiah 38-39. Motyer sees that as the beginning of a new section that ends in Isaiah 55. His outline is interesting and his explanations defending his outline are good. In Isaiah 38-39 he deals with Hezekiah's predicatment and outlines the passage with a Chiastic structure that points to Hezekiah's deeper challenge that seems to underlie the text. I found that in this passage at least, Motyer's comments were more illuminating than even the excellently written NIVAC by Oswalt or the NICOT by Oswalt. Motyer sees the Chiasm in Isaiah 38-39 as pointing to Hezekiah's difficulty in obeying the point of the law where Judah is not to make alliances with foreign nations.The poetic structure with an emphasis on the dedication of Hezekiah in 38:8-22 and the defection of Hezekiah in 39:1-2 is a fresh and preaching alliterated point that I actually ended up using in my sermon on Hezekiah.My respect for this author has been on the rise the more I look into his work. He packs a lot into every page. Excellent book, well worth the shekels.

As an evangelical pastor, I study the NT in Greek for sermons on a weekly basis. As I do, I often find myself looking up issues in Systematic Theology. Lots of pastors use this book. If you want to know where to go for more research on a topic...he gives great lists of resources spanning across almost every denominational perspective available. So if you want to know where to get a scholarly view on 'once saved always saved' from the baptists, methodists and a host of other groups he gives you that in short list form. For that alone the book is an unusual resource.Most theological books don't attempt to impact your devotional life...and can be dry. Not Grudem...he gives meditation scriptures and a song/hymn for personal worship. This book is just a great book.Some of the topics can be taken in an outline form and filled in with illustrations...they preach very well when used like this. For example...his article on 'Final Judgment' is one that preaches well. Just make sure to give him credit if doing that.Also-this book can provide a great start for research into a topic.I think all ministers of the gospel should consult this book regularly. You may not agree with all his points on everything...but you have to respect a tool that has been so well composed and has helped so many already!

As a practicing pastor who tries to develop sermons from the Greek text, I've been working through Ephesians. When I started my series a couple pastor friends recommended Stott's commentary on Ephesians, which I purchased. I also picked up about four or five other commentaries including this one. Then I've borrowed about a dozen more commentaries. As I have worked through the text (I'm now in chapter 5) I've found that Bruce is more accurate in his handling of the Greek text than Peter O'Brien or John Stott. One case is Ephesians 2:1 where Bruce correctly identifies trespasses and sins as synonyms. Stott & O'Brien come up with various theories which sound good but don't hold water with the lexical entries or scholars I've been interacting with online. I've found this repeated again in Ephesians 4:22-24 where Bruce identifies aorist infinitives not as past tense verbs, but as verbs that tilt towards imperatives (as most translators agree). However, Stott unconvincingly argues that these aorist infinitives must be past tense, even though he is flying in the face of Greek grammars on aorist tense and most biblical translators.For these reasons I've learned to turn to Bruce first before I check my other commentaries. And if I don't have time to read several versions I tend to go to this one first.I guess I would recommend preaching pastors/teachers to use Bruce to make sure that any great sounding phrases or things that might preach well from other commentators are really accurate.If Bruce has a drawback it is in the very area that I love Stott for the most. Bruce doesn't always come up with great sounding phrases that would preach well. Stott does that all through his commentary. So I guess at least for Ephesians, I would use Stott for application and Bruce for exegesis.There are a few times where Bruce doesn't give a lot of detail. My assumption is that there's not much worth commenting on in the scope of theories out there. Having said that, I can't imagine studying Ephesians in depth without Bruce. It's fantastic. Get a copy if you can! For a minister's library,it might be the best commentary out there on Ephesians.

I think I own all the major versions of the Greek NT. This one is my favorite because I like the fonts better. The UBS version is harder on the eyes and I just don't like to read it as much as this one.The technical apparatus is superior to the 3rd edition with many changes and improvements. Still, it's tough to decipher the apparatus unless you spend a lot of time learning how to interpret it...or you are really sharp. To make better sense out of the apparatus, one needs Metzger's Textual Commentary as a companion. It looks and feels like this version of the NT...so there's some emotional pay off if you care about that sort of thing.The cross references are also nice if you are doing sermon exegesis...usually there are some great passages to tie into a point hidden in those little cross references and they are worth looking up. That's not really new though since the 2nd and 3rd editions had the same benefit. Some scholars like the cross references in the UBS version better. I have not seen a lot of difference...but I'm no scholar either.The best Greek NT I have overall is the Novum Testamentum Graece published by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft. It has the most helpful cross references, although I don't like the fonts on it as much as this one.So it may be useful to have that edition for that purpose.Overall I'm very glad that I bought this one.

As a pastor who had all the basic and advance Greek grammar years ago...i try to do a good job of exegesis on each sermon. As I have developed my exegesis process, this book, and it's companion, Biblical Greek (by Zerwick) have helped me expand my understanding of Greek. The little lesson codes in the Grammatical Analysis lead you to more training in Greek. For example, prepositional phrases may have a variety of nuances depending on the shade of meaning that the preposition implies in the context. Zerwick labels these nuances and gives relevant lesson codes tied right into the text. So for a typical passage I'm working on for a sermon, I can often have 4-7 five or ten minute Biblical Greek lessons at my finger tips. That is very cool. Sometimes they are just technical jazz that wastes time....but other times it helps me retranslate the passage or phrase! I always try to check those little lessons...in fact I have gotten into the habit of highlighting them for the passage I'm working on and zooming in on them while waiting for something somewhere.The criticisms of this book (don't believe the reviews that say it's fabulous...it has it's flaws too). Sometimes I've seen a catholic bias in the text (it is from Rome you know)....or have been unable to find scholars online who really know what he's referring to...he can be difficult to understand...but that is rare-maybe a couple times per year for me. The more substantive criticism really is that he gives so little information and uses so many abbreviations that you have to be on your toes to know exactly what he means or look up a lot of stuff. Once you start using it all the time, then these problems go away...because your knowledge level should rise.If you really don't remember your first year greek at all...this book is probably too tough for you. If you remember some of your first year Greek, it may help you start moving forward in your exegesis. It sure is practically laid out...organized like the NT starting with Matthew 1:1. I use BibleWorks 6.0 for my exegesis and have Zerwick with me in my book bag where-ever I go right next to my laptop.For the exegesis process, NT Exegesis by Gordon Fee is the best book I've found. I use his sermon exegesis process. He recommends Zerwick as the best Grammatical Analysis tool for quickly identifying exegetical difficulties in a text when doing either full exegesis or sermon exegesis. His analysis is that Zerwick is the most complete and helpful analysis of the NT for the exegesis process! I completely agree.

This commentary has more than enough for a typical pastor who is exegeting Isaiah for a sermon series. He recognizes that visions ought not be interpreted literally all the way through, and also seems solid on the author issue, yet intelligently interacts with the other views in his extended introduction. I found more material than I care to read on the theories of how Isaiah was written. I found his conclusions convincing and I agree with his rejection of multiple authors on the basis of no ancient evidence at all. (That was only part of his argument).The commentary itself lends itself to be a preaching aid for Pastors/Bible Teachers. There is plenty of meat there for anyone who desires to study. For example, in Isaiah 4:4 the term 'daughters of Zion' is used. At one point some scribes adjusted the phrase because of the implications for men if only the daughters of Zion are blessed. However, Oswalt points out that if we interpret this symbolically as a reference to all of Jerusalem, then there is no problem with seeing the blessing coming on both men and women. The over zealous literalists don't have an answer for that which makes sense. Oswalt has excellent information throughout this commentary.I also recommend John Walton's Bible Background Commentary of the OT as a supplement to this. Another great commentary is Motyer on Isaiah.Here is my review on the other volume for your convenience.This review focuses on Volume 2 on Isaiah for the NICOT series. I'm a preacher and full time pastor who uses commentaries in my sermon preparation. I've found that this commentary is very helpful on a number of points. It provides a wealth of relevant resources that I've typically not found in other commentaries (I'll illustrate that in a moment). He deals with the Hebrew exegetical ideas and source issues without spending a lot of time (no bogging down in minutia as some have a tendency to do). His footnotes do contain the minutia on textual issues that some require or desire. Yet in the main text of his commentary he deals with crucial textual issues if they affect the exegetical outcome. That's helpful, especially his pithy summaries of the various views. Summaries are well done in this commentary.The second volume has over 700 pages of information on Isaiah 40-66.Since it may be the greatest passage in Isaiah, let me zoom in on how he handles the fourth Servant song. (Isaiah 52:13 to 53:3). For this section he gives 37 pages of information. He breaks the passage down into the following outline:a. Astonishment and Rejection (52:13-53:3)b. Punished for others (53:4-6)c. Unjustly punished (53:7-9)d. Many made righteous (53:10-12)He provides his own unique translation for each one.In section a. Astonishment and Rejection 52:13-53:3 Oswalt prefers the translation in 52:15 of the Hebrew 'Yazzeh' [sprinkle] to be interpreted as 'startle' because of the parallelism meaning. He also interacts with a variety of other opinions, including a footnote on 52:14 that introduces some technical points about protasis and apodasis as support for his position. They really do make the most sense of all the options (imo).I was convinced by his points. For application ideas, see Oswalt's NIVAC on Isaiah. In that volume, which I also own, he draws out practical application to Philippians 2:5-11 as he discusses the idea of sacrificing for others. Then he draws out contemporary significance to this passage in his NIVAC by focusing on Accepting the offering by an appropriate response to what Jesus has done for us. He has many preachable points in this section.Overall, Oswalt has written a worthy commentary that I believe is an excellent addition to every pastor's library. I also have found Alec Motyer's commentary on Isaiah to be very helpful, especially for a quick evaluation of literary style and outline ideas.Oswalt's NIVAC commentary won the Gold Medallion Award. I think this commentary I am reviewing here, the NICOT, is worthy of an award. It's that good.Back to the passage I was using to illustrate Oswalt's NICOT Vol 2 with.At the end of his commentary on Isaiah 52:13-53:12, he has an Excursus.Actually it is a select bibliography on the passage. However, the bibliography is organized into categories:The Identity of the ServantNew Testament and Early Christian InterpretationJewish InterpretationExegetical and Theological StudiesAlthough several of the bibliographical entries are obviously in German, and useless to most of us, most of them are in English.Here is my note on the first volume of this series.This commentary has more than enough for a typical pastor who is exegeting Isaiah for a sermon series. He recognizes that visions ought not be interpreted literally all the way through, and also seems solid on the author issue, yet intelligently interacts with the other views in his extended introduction. I found more material than I care to read on the theories of how Isaiah was written.

First off, we have a five user pack, with one installed on each of our kids computers (four kids w/computers at home). I have used it for 3 years. I chose this over some other software available because 3 years ago it had more features than the other companies out there.Let me say a couple of things. Some of the features work well, and some don't. For example, we have put options in for the kids to be able to access their own personal pages on Myspace (which I monitor), but not the other pages. That doesn't seem to matter, Cybersitter won't let one of my kids on her page, but the other one CAN go. I followed the same procedure for both computers. My son is not allowed to play his war game online, even though I told it to let him online...put that game in the good list...it will let him onto the site...let him set up a game...but then freezes the loading...very frustrating for kids trying to play. The only way around this I have found is to suspend the program (that's easy to do for an administrator).The snoop feature doesn't work on any of their computers...so I cannot see what they've been doing. Also, the report emails work fine, and have been useful from time to time. I know one of my kids had a friend who was trying to se profanity in chats and they were blocked regularly...the report shows who that was and the blocked messages. It is very difficult to read though....because it looks almost like a computer read out.Some kids will try to work around CyberSitter by using proxy websites. CyberSitter really should block all proxy sites, but they don't.At the same time CyberSitter has regularly not allowed sites that are supposed to be blocked. For example we have gambling sites checked as places we don't want our kids to go to. One of my teens was doing a research report on the recent James Bond movie "Casino Royale". Because it had the word Casino in it, she could see none of the hits until I suspended the program filtering temporarily. Even though that was irritating, I felt good that it was still blocking some things.I am adding filters to my office computers and will try another brand-because I have become aware of another company that has a filter that is better in some respects, perhaps operating more smoothly than CyberSitter...but it does not have email/IM protection...and if kids do anything online they are probably on AOL IM..... So for kids this is number one because it is still the best one on the market that has instant message and email filtering...how can anyone say they are protecting kids without that?? It is absolutely amazing to me that there are products on the market that claim to protect kids from the junk out there...and they have NOTHING for chat/email. To me that is just not living in the real world. So even with it's flaws, I think CyberSitter is the best thing available for families and I recommend you get it.

This device is a total blast. It's got educational options...like speed tests for math and intelligence quizzes that make you think. It has great games...and talks to other units like it. Our youngest child got one for Christmas in 2006 and everyone wants to play it all the time. It's one of the most popular toys we have. Tonight he came to me with his gameboy, which was new last year...and said..I want to sell this. I won't need it anymore.The thing is durable...you can speak and it responds instantly with an assessment of your speach. You can write on the screen. It has controls for gameplay. It's way better than Gameboy...and I have to say it is a great option to a more expensive system that really shouldn't travel.Hope you get one and have a blast with it as our kids are.

For an old fashioned contemporary movie with some unexplained phenomena, this movie is pretty good. For Christian families who care, there are a few references to Jesus (using profanity), and there is some shacking up in the movie...but no sex scenes. So if you care about that, it is in this movie.Otherwise, the plot is interesting and holds attention most of the way through.It is nice to see Bullock in a movie where she is not acting nutty for a change. I enjoyed her more on this movie than on any one I can think of for a long time.It's a romantically charged plot with great turns in the 90 minutes. It's a good date movie.The mix of an architext, a lawyer and a doctor moves the lifestyles up towards the high end of American living. But the plot kinda demands that so that certain things can happen. So it actually enhances the movie. We saw a flaw in the movie....some trees that were planted in 2004 were about 10 years older looking in 2006. That was not a big flaw, but I noticed it.In my opinion, the final turn in the plot requires some thought to understand the intricacies of what really happened and how, which makes the movie worth seeing twice (per my wife and daughter).Overall we have to say this is the first Bullock movie we have been able to highly recommend in a long time! Way to go Sandra!

Maxwell does a great job of breaking down sometimes difficult concepts into memorable labels that help one remember what he says. For example, the law of the lid...number one...is a great way of summarizing the truth it presents. If you have read the chapter, you can remember it well by simply repeating the title of the chapter.For speakers/preachers, he has a lot of great quotes and stories that may help you develop your leadership team/ministry.One key drawback is that it's really tough to keep all the laws of leadership in mind or to come up with a practical way to apply so many laws at once. It would be great to boil it all down to about 3 to 5 key issues. It would be easier to apply personally for the average person.Another drawback is the fact that he presents 'laws' without any attempt to convince you that these are truly laws demonstrated by any objective research. Who says these are the laws...how do we define laws...and are there any other laws besides these?Having said that, it's a must read if you need to influence people around you to do something good with their lives.

This movie had our family laughing a lot. I think Lindsay does a really good job acting in this movie..and she is a delight to watch. At the same time the plot is a little predictable, but it's still funny, unless you have an attitude about this genre...then don't watch it.Our kids and my wife and I watched it more than once and enjoyed it each time. Some of the use of profanity as another reviewer pointed out, should have put this into a pg category, in my opinion. So if you are offended by that, and I am, take notice on this movie.In all though the movie is a great family flick and we will probably watch it again someday.

I bought this book only because I've read Exegetical Fallacies by Carson and I was doing a sermon series on Philippians. While comparing this book to other works on Philippians, it is lacking in technical detail on many issues, but it outshines my other resources in presenting the thrust of the book in a memorable and practical way. So for a preaching/teaching minister who is working through Philippians, I think this is a valuable resource.For example...when working through Philippians chapter 1 I had come to a summary conclusion on my own...and adjusted it after reading other commentaries. I had to rethink everything after reading Carson and eventually rewrote my sermon notes because of this perspective...I found it compellingly accurate. Instead of simply evaluating Paul's emphasis on thanksgiving and prayer as most works do...and showing the patterns in detail that relate to ancient forms of writing...Carson analyzes the content of these two paragraphs in Philippians 1 and says that the key is 'Put the gospel first'. He then applies that in different arenas...such as in your prayer life...fellowship with other believers and so on. When you reread Philippians 1 again it is clear that he has pointed out accurately what was going on.Fresh summary from a deeper perspective. I had lost that perspective in the details of the verse by verse analysis with my other commentaries (some of the very best included). So this is an excellent book. It's different than anything else I have on Philippians. Highly recommended!

Mike has written a book here that has changed many lives. It's one that every Christian should read and mull over.I think one point in the book that I would adjust is his teaching on imagining God. He assumes that because God's throne is described in Revelations 4 and Ezekiel 1 that we must therefore be able to imagine God in our minds. He doesn't deal with the concept that God may have given us these descriptions without intending for us to create paintings of God on the easel of our own minds. He teaches that people should use Revelation 4 and Ezekiel 1 throne room scenes to imagine what God looks like. Then pray to the image in your mind. This extra-biblical concept can lead one to create an image in their mind of what God is like...when in reality it is an image in their mind...it isn't God. Don't do that. Let God reveal himself to you through real visions, not images you create in your own mind. Ask God to reveal Himself to you instead through a direct experience rather than creating something in your mind.If the experiences you have with God match with the bible, then you will have a powerful confirmation of your encounter with the Lord.Mike Bickle is an excellent man. His life has helped countless people, including myself. He was my pastor for years...and a neighbor. Now that I'm a pastor, I can see that I would not be in the ministry if it were not for Mike's inspiration to seek Jesus and it's profound effect on my life. That is the key emphasis in this book...and if you open your heart to Jesus while reading this book you will be changed.Mike is well known for inspiring people to seek Jesus. And this is the first book he published along that line. It really is a classic even though it's only been out for maybe ten years or so. So even though I have a concern about one teaching in this book, the overall book is tremendous.Every Christian should own a copy and read it at least once or twice. I heartily recommend you buy a copy-and an extra one for giving out to friends. Just add my footnote in there if you agree with me on that one point.Grace...

(Isaiah 52:13 to 53:3). For this section he gives 37 pages of information. He breaks the passage down into the following outline:a. Astonishment and Rejection (52:13-53:3)b. Punished for others (53:4-6)c. Unjustly punished (53:7-9)d. Many made righteous (53:10-12)He provides his own unique translation for each one.In section a. Astonishment and Rejection 52:13-53:3 Oswalt prefers the translation in 52:15 of the Hebrew 'Yazzeh' [sprinkle] to be interpreted as 'startle' because of the parallelism meaning. He also interacts with a variety of other opinions, including a footnote on 52:14 that introduces some technical points about protasis and apodasis as support for his position. They really do make the most sense of all the options (imo).I was convinced by his points. For application ideas, see Oswalt's NIVAC on Isaiah. In that volume, which I also own, he draws out practical application to Philippians 2:5-11 as he discusses the idea of sacrificing for others. Then he draws out contemporary significance to this passage in his NIVAC by focusing on Accepting the offering by an appropriate response to what Jesus has done for us. He has many preachable points in this section.Overall, Oswalt has written a worthy commentary that I believe is an excellent addition to every pastor's library. I also have found Alec Motyer's commentary on Isaiah to be very helpful, especially for a quick evaluation of literary style and outline ideas.Oswalt's NIVAC commentary won the Gold Medallion Award. I think this commentary I am reviewing here, the NICOT, is worthy of an award. It's that good.Back to the passage I was using to illustrate Oswalt's NICOT Vol 2 with.At the end of his commentary on Isaiah 52:13-53:12, he has an Excursus.Actually it is a select bibliography on the passage. However, the bibliography is organized into categories:The Identity of the ServantNew Testament and Early Christian InterpretationJewish InterpretationExegetical and Theological StudiesAlthough several of the bibliographical entries are obviously in German, and useless to most of us, most of them are in English.

Essentially this is a great resource. I would give it a five star if they made two changes to the program.1) Give the mandarin three times in a row (with different voices). This is because the brain imprint maximum impact for learning occurs with three repetitions in a row. I think another product does this, but that product does not have anywhere near the quantity of vocabulary terms.2) Give the Traditional Mandarin character alongside the simplified. This is important for anyone where the traditional characters are used instead of simplified.Each level has about 1500 words and phrases. You can listen to one part of one side of a tape/cd file for less than 20 minutes and repeatedly drill yourself on 170 words. This is very helpful. After ten or fifteen times of doing this you will recognize most of the words and eventually build a strong vocabulary. Each level has 1500 words, so if you learn all three levels you will be seriously on your way to speaking decent Mandarin. These are a mix of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs and expressions. Many of the words are commonly used so the selection is very practical (unlike Rosetta Stone which starts out with elephant). In essence this is an audio flash card file. If you don't mind listening to it for awhile, you can just turn it on while you are browsing or doing something else and allow words to become introduced to you. If you repeat that over and over you will start recognizing more and more terms. And if you want to focus on the words, rather than absorb them in the background, you can pull out the booklet and read along. They give the English, Simplified Character and then Pin Yin. I find it very helpful. In about 18 minutes you get an audio flash card drill of 170 words or so. If you repeat those same 18 minutes about 10 times, you have a decent initial exposure to enough vocabulary to get started. Then after you know most of those words, move on to the next section of the material. If you use this method to work through these six tapes you will know 4,500 words and phrases when you are done. I know of no other product that gives you so much exposure to Chinese. I used this method in Russian years ago and it helped me communicate in a number of instances when other foreigners around me could not. So I'm adding this to my Chinese lessons and it is helping me already.Another thing they have done that I like is to mix in a bit of classical music. It fades in and out to help keep your attention focused. Otherwise such a long list of words can become mind-numbing for some people. The music provides a pleasant background mix to help you stay focused. I like it.Then this product challenges you by reversing the order. Giving Chinese words first and then the English. I personally don't like this part of the product as well, but it does make me think differently and I'm sure it has benefit.The one advantage I see of using this product is that it can raise the number of vocabulary terms you know by several hundred in just 20 or 30 hours. That can help you know at least some of what's being talked about when you are around native speakers. And it can help them communicate better with you when you speak out a word that you understand so they know what words you know and what words you don't know.The idiomatic expressions are particularly helpful.I would not want to go without this product. I think it's excellent!

As a pastor who has read Rick Warren's first major book, "The Purpose Driven Church", I thought this book would do well on the market when it came out. However, myself and many other pastors I know have been surprised to see how much influence this book has had in our nation. It has touched a deeper need than we recognized. For that alone I am grateful to Rick for writing this book.Many people have had their lives changed by this book.Like his book, Purpose Driven Church, this book follows a very practical approach that will help you remember what he says and apply it to your life.There are fair criticisms of the book. One of them that I've read is that there is nothing in the bible to teach us that forty days are required for us to get a grip on the purpose of our lives. It's probably not biblical to try to make 40 days a spiritual sounding time frame...it's just a good idea and it matches the time Jesus spent in the wilderness. Really that is not a big deal though...and so I wouldn't knock the books rating because of a little thing like that.He confronts people with the true purpose for your existence...which flows straight from the revelation of the bible. It's powerful. It's true and you will be changed by this book if you read it with an open heart and mind. I wouldn't let the current news events sway me to the right or the left on this book. It's truths are timeless truths that you can use today or in ten years. For that reason alone it's worth owning a copy.When you weigh the fact that so many lives are being transformed by this book, I have to give it a five star rating.On top of that, thousands of pastors are using Rick's stuff because he has wonderfully ministered to pastors all over the world for a long time now. And he has impacted my life through his sermon training series called "Preaching for Life Change" and through his book "Purpose Driven Church". So it's no wonder that pastors all over the world use and recommend this book.If you have not read it, I would like to invite you to obtain a copy as soon as possible and read it prayerfully!

Before I was a pastor, I led worship on Saturday nights for a prayer meeting. The man who led the prayer meeting was Wes Adams, who was the associate editor of this Study Bible. At the time Donald Stamps had finished most of the notes, which were written while he was serving as a missionary in South America. Both of these scholars possess(ed) a fire for Jesus. I heard Wes (Dr. Adams) pray every Saturday night for the lost...for those who need a touch from Jesus...for revival to come to America....and to the nations. He has a heart of gold...and he is a scholar. A scholar on fire for the Lord.This study bible is different from other study bibles. The notes are full of practical points that are excellent for personal living...for preaching in sermons...and yet are being written from an anointed scholarly vantage point.I found after going into the ministry that I often will find a great applicable point in the notes of this study bible that will challenge me and our congregation to seek the Lord more.I don't agree with every point in this study bible...but I can say that the overall tone of it is written not from an office in a seminary, but from the knees of a missionary scholar in the field. For this alone, one should keep a copy of this study bible handy. If you can only get one study bible, then I would get this one. I have access to dozens of study bibles and this one has stayed on my desk, in my book bag or in my hand for years. It's just one of the very best. (Now in 2011 I echo what I wrote in 2006. This study Bible has come with us to Taiwan where we now live. It's still our favorite. Also the Life Application Study Bible is helpful in my view).As far as versions go...it's only available in NIV or KJV. I would recommend also getting an English Standard Version, and compare those with the NIV text for this.I hope you decide to buy a copy of this study bible. Get a leather bound if you can afford it. They last for a long time and are worth the extra money.

I've had one of these models for about four years. It is very easy to use because it is not only cordless, but has the tap feature which is supposed to feed more string out if your string gets too short. It has some weight to it compared to a corded string trimmer, but it is not that bad.This trimmer avoids the problems intrinsic to gas powered trimmers because it starts with the squeeze of a trigger. I was so happy to be rid of my gas trimmer, but soon I found a brand new problem. The battery doesn't last very long.My yard is a typical suburban yard with a fenced back yard that is about 60' by 80'. It takes me about 15 to 25 minutes to trim my whole yard depending on the height of the grass. A few times this trimmer actually lasted through the entire job, but after one or two trimmings, I found the duration of the battery shorter and shorter. It got to the point where I had to recharge it in the middle of each job once. Then the next year it was twice.No one stocks the batteries for this because they are built into a housing (quite a hassle). My first thought was that the battery was defective. I found that it was going to cost quite a bit to get the trimmer sent off to Black & Decker's service center and that a new batter would cost over $50 with shipping. I only paid about $80 for the whole unit. I ended up borrowing my Dad's trimmer, which was corded. So I guess I would recommend only getting cordless trimmers that have batteries that can be easily switched out or changed (like a battery with it's own durable housing). I cannot recommend this model, even though it works pretty well when fully charged.Another little glitch on this unit is that the tap feature often jams up and then you have to stop and disassemble the string holder and figure out what jammed and fix it. That slows down the entire process of trimming. But honestly I have that problem with any string trimmer...gas, corded or cordless...so that is not an unusual negative for this model, but it is a fact you ought to bear in mind.I like Black and Decker overall and found that my other products from them are usually just fine.

This grammar is very helpful in a pastor's study (I am a pastor). It stays in my book bag most of the time. When doing sermon exegesis for the LXX or GNT I use Gordon Fee's "NT Exegesis" method. When preparing for my exegesis provisional translation of the text, I use Zerwick's Grammatical Analysis with the coded lessons to his Biblical Greek book. Then I use this book, BDF's Grammar, to read more indepth on the grammatical points that Zerwick describes.Usually in Zerwick there are 3 to 6 grammar highlights that he points out. So if I have time, I can learn a lot more by going to the referenced Grammar point in BDF and reading it through.For example when working on Philippians 3:12 this week I found three lessons in Zerwicks analysis...the first one dealing with INA and the subjunctive mood (indirect discourse application). While reading Zerwicks concise and very helpful grammar he actually cites BDF lesson 368 (that's this book currently being reviewed). So when I go there I find a lot more information on the exact same point along with quotations to ancient Christian lit/GNT. The broader context of everything in BDF also provides a clearer picture. In Zerwick's Analysis there is a clause about the point...in his grammar a paragraph...and in BDF you have half a page. And you can jump from one to the other in a few seconds.When you are done doing that, you feel like you just either refreshed yourself in an old grammar point, or learned something useful that you maybe never picked up in college or seminary.So I recommend Pastors who have some Greek knowledge to use Zerwick's Grammatical Analysis and Biblical Greek book...along with this one. The combination will give you the confidence you need to make a provisional translation of the text for your sermon each week. The way these books are laid out, it only takes about an hour or so of reading, max, to accompish this. Over time, you will find your Greek grammar knowledge actually sharpening even though you are not in school. Just work these steps into your sermon prep time.The point that Wallace makes in his review below about Classical Greek is important to consider. I have found it helpful to consult other Grammars or scholars online if there are questions along that line. One good group online is b-greek. Just google that and you will find it. The scholars on that group will often answer questions without any problem.

I actually use the BDAG 3rd Edition add on in BibleWorks 7.0 along with Kittel's TDNT and Spicq's Theological Lexicon book sets. In my software I have BDAG next to Thayer's, Liddell & Scott, Louw & Nida's Semantical Domain, United Bible Societies, and Friberg's Lexicon. I use all of them every week for sermon exegesis (except for Kittel's and Spicq's). BDAG is a great lexicon, maybe not the best...as some reviewers have said. It really depends on what you are studying. Louw & Nida's Semantical domain really helps one see the range of a word in context to other words, and BDAG doesn't do that. BDAG gives one a lot of information, but if you are not a trained scholar, it's hard to understand it all. So often I end up turning to other lexicons for more information.There is a tendency with BDAG towards gender inclusivity in some entries, so if you are concerned about that issue, you may be happy or unhappy with that depending on your position. It's more accurate than the older editions. Just know that the gender inclusive approach is controversial and a reason why this lexicon should be compared with others. I really like to compare this lexicon with the semantical domain lexicon by Louw & Nida.Comparing this lexicon with other lexicons is super easy in the outstanding professional grade exegetical software called BibleWorks 6.0. (See my review there). With the pass of mouse, one can see all the lexicons on a word, with BDAG being just one of several. This allows constant comparison...and that's really the best way to use this lexicon in my opinion. When you do that over and over, week after week, month after month as I do, one gets the feel for this lexicon's strength. That strength is in providing good categories for a word, citing prime examples of each category, and a relatively fair approach in controversial issues.A nice improvement has been hyperlinks that allow one to click on BDAG citations to see their fuller context in the program. I don't think I would get the book copy of this lexicon because the software version allows you to quickly paste an entry next to other lexicons in a word document and print them out for further ease of study and note taking. How easy is that with a printed copy of the lexicon?With a program like BibleWorks 7.0 or their competitors one can search the lemma of a word instantly to see other instances of the use/form/stem which BDAG may not mention and get a graphical analysis of useage throughout various LXX/NT writers so you can assess the word in a more general way.Overall, BDAG turns out to be very helpful in providing a base to chase down more information on the nuance of a word's meaning for certain situations/contexts. I cannot imagine doing exegesis without it. I would only recommend you stick the $140 bucks into software that has BDAG as an add-on. It's worth the extra money.2009 update to this review: I've found some bias in this lexicon. I've learned that one must double check the work, and have come to see more of this lexicon as a 'commentary' than as unbiased lexical data. For example, the word 'PROGINOSKO' (to foreknow) is defined in Thayer's lexicon simply as to foreknow, yet in BDAG it has two definitions: To foreknow AND also to choose beforehand. This second definition is then leaned on heavily by Calvinists to argue for Unconditional Eternal Election based in part on the two appearances of 'Proginosko' in Romans (8:29 is the classic example). The problem with this second definition is that the term 'Proginosko' is NEVER used to mean 'Choose beforehand' in any extra-biblical literature, Greek or Jewish anywhere. It always clearly means 'to know before' or 'foreknow' usually in a prophetic sense. And if one is willing to entertain theological views outside of Calvinism, then the definition 'Foreknow' fits beautifully in Romans 8:29. (BTW-Arminians differ on whether this matters for their position-I think it strengthens their position, but many don't think it's a necessary point). In any case, Lexicons should give definitions based on some convincing evidence...especially BDAG (which cites ancient sources outside the NT in it's very title!) So this example, and there are others, demonstrates why I have learned to double check ALL lexicons and their claims. Especially when any sort of debate is involved. Double check their claims by looking at the use of the term for yourself. This is very simple with one of the professional grade software programs out there. BibleWorks 8.0 is my current favorite, but there are others that can call up all uses of any term in a wide array of ancient literature (especially Jewish literature from 300 BC through 200 AD.Inspite of this big warning, summed up by a quote from Dr. Greg Beale at Wheaton College Grad School, "All Lexicons are commentaries", and inspite of the bias I find in this Lexical commentary, it is still a valuable tool and worthy of a five star. I still use it all the time, just double check the notes to make sure there is no bias.

I'm a preaching pastor who tries to work from the Greek text. I've read and marked up most of my Stott copy on Romans. It is in my top five commentaries on Romans and I use it a lot. However, I have to disagree with the other two reviews on this book.Some positives on this book include:Instead of giving the typical break at 1:15 & 1:16, like most commentators, Stott explains it like this:Vs 14 I am boundVs 15 I am eagerVs 16 I am not ashamed(1:16 & 17 state the theme of Romans, but Stott splits 16 off and matches it to the end of the previous paragraph. This fresh view makes one think. I believe that is one of Stott's great assets). So he is unique and has some really good things to say. It's worth reading. It is great for preaching ideas. However, many times he gives a view that flows from one perspective of theology on a verse, with no hint or cue that there are other views that may differ from him. Sometimes his perspective is not really taken seriously by contemporary scholars-yet Stott fails to even mention there are opposing views. So he can have a bit of eisegetical theology mixed into his exegesis. For this reason, I totally disagree with the reviewer who said something like if you could only own one commentary on Romans that this was the one to get. It probably should be number three or four in a list of priorities-not number one, at least for exegetical work.Specifics:At one point he brings Calvinistic terminology into a simple use of the term law, attempting to suggest an exegetically exotic view. More careful commentaries, like Moo on Romans reject his approach as difficult to support. Another example is his effort on Romans 6 to say that the power of sin is not included in what Paul is talking about. Stott insists that it is the guilt of sin only that Paul is covering in 6:1-14. There is no contextual factor to warrant that conclusion. Again, more thorough and careful evangelical works on that section do not agree with his assessment. (Stott is this way in his Ephesians commentary as well).So how I use Stott is for a fresh look at the text and great phrases that preach well. As far as exegetical accuracy, I would lean towards Moo and Edwards on Romans. So I recommend Stott on Romans, but not for every paragraph-and not as the main commentary one owns for serious work in the Greek text. For that, one cannot be without the NICNT by Moo-which is far more complete and careful in its analysis. So if you can afford to get Stott, add him to your collection and compare what he says to other guys like Edwards Moo, Kasemann, etc....He's got a great way of phrasing things and I've used his phrasing in sermon outlines more than once.

I am a pastor and am currently preaching through Romans 8, doing my own exegesis from the Greek text. I have worked through many commentaries on Romans and I have to say that I had very little expectation that this commentary would be helpful. I saw this commentary cited in the NICNT by Moo (I think Moo NICNT is the finest Romans commentary on the market today), found it in a library and started looking at it.I was impressed when I learned that he taught Romans continually for 56 years at Princeton from 1820 something on. His commentary is far superior to many of the ones I own on Romans (I have maybe 20 or so). His exegesis is exceptionally mature, careful and interactive with other commentators. It reads like someone who has spent decades carefully studying the Greek text of Romans in some of the most crucial places. For example, his teaching on the concept of being 'in Christ' in Romans 8:1...(you know...there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus) reflects maturity of thought. He broke the categories of how we are in Christ into three categories that made me really think.I think this sort of input comes only from a teacher who has gone over the text repeatedly for decades. You know the used copies are really cheap and his insight is superior in my opinion to Luther, Murray and many others out there.At the same time, there are several commentaries on Romans that far surpass this one. Two that stand apart in my mind are Doug Moo's NICNT (see my review on his commentary) and Schreiner's BECNT. But if you can pick up Hodge on Romans for a few dollars his perspective is sometimes very interesting to read and definately worth owning in my view.

This product is a great idea. It blends a summary of what we are pretty sure about for each city of the seven in Revelation, blending them into a visual look at the related items. The regular reference back to a map after each city, shows the progression and is like a table of contents to help one see where he is in the process.One of the songs has some off pitch singing in it and an off pitch sax that actually hurt my ears. Fortunately that did not last for more than one verse.Mr. Nunn does explain things well for each city. Some of the explanations are tied well to visuals, but some are not as clearly linked. For example, the visual on hot springs being piped into Laodicea is excellent, showing the distance and effect of lukewarm water with minerals concentrated in it. He gives sweeping panoramic views of a number of scenes in Ephesus with explanations that are succinct.Basically what you have is about 5 minutes of discussion on each city. You cannot talk through a lot of information in 5 minutes, especially if time is wasted with chatter. This product doesn't have a lot of time wasters. I appreciated this aspect.It was interesting enough that I watched the entire thing through in one sitting even though I was tired.Some of the screen fades in and out are not all that professional, but overall, this product scratches an itch I've had for a long time. Video coupled with archeological information on each city to help understand more clearly what is going on in each one.I'm glad I had a chance to see it.

I'm a pastor working through Micah for a sermon series. I purchased this commentary because it looked very interesting. I'm very glad I bought it, but it is not exactly what I thought I was buying. Let me explain so that you can make a more informed decision than I was able to make.My illustrations and summaries will focus on his translation, exegesis and exposition for Micah 3:1-4. My executive summary is simply this: If you know Hebrew and are technically oriented, this is your commentary. If you don't know Hebrew and are oriented towards application that preaches well...this ain't it baby. However, he does give some application ideas in his expositional segments.The details on my executive summary:1) Each segment has an outline title (overall he has three cycles for the whole book). He has a subtitle for Micah 3:1-12 and then a title for the subsegment 3:1-4. All of the titles are purely exegetical. For example he titles 3:1-4 (Shepherds turned Cannibals).After providing his own translation of the passage, he turns to extensive word by word or phrase by phrase exegesis. For verse one, which has 11 words (some compounds) in the original Hebrew text, Waltke gives almost four full pages of technical data on the Hebrew text. He includes comments about what bits and phrases are considered original and who opposes those ideas and why he agrees or disagrees. For a scholarly paper on Micah, it is a goldmine. Only pastors who are well versed in Hebrew grammar will understand everything Waltke says in this commentary. For example in his expository comments on Micah 6:8 Waltke refers to a complex myriad of factors including subsets of Hebrew that I've never heard of. He cites parsing of words moving from Hebrew parsing to the LXX (Greek) and sometimes cites Latin. Yet everything is transliterated. So if you are like me, (not good at Hebrew transliteration), you have to have a Hebrew text open with some software enabled (I use BibleWorks 7.0) to really track Waltke.If you want to look intently at the options for a word or phrase, this commentary will not let you down. But make sure you have some time on your hands. It's no quick read.His short summaries of Hebrew grammatical analysis are impossible to understand unless you remember your Hebrew grammar) but helpful grammatical notes are packed into each paragraph. Not only does he explain each particle, but he goes on to explain how the LXX translated it, giving the Greek text (transliterated also). He is well-versed in Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek and probably other languages (at least he cites or refers to other obscure languages often).After 8 full pages of exegesis on Micah 3:1-4, he then begins his exposition section. He gives 4 full pages of exposition on top of the exegesis. For pastors, this is the section to zoom in on. Sometimes Waltke weaves helpful application nuggets into his exposition. On this section he speculates that Micah is probably addressing gifted and privileged magistrates who are congregated in the Temple Courts in Jerusalem during an annual festival. He ties the judgment proclamation to law principles scattered throughout several books in the Torah. He cites parallel or related concepts throughout the major prophets like Isaiah. Into these references he sometimes cites direct applications. For example for his Isaiah connection he cites the good being called bad and bad being called good quote from Isa 5:20. He bemoans the Supreme Court of the USA allowing abortion of babies and also allowing blasphemy and smut to foul society. The link from judges in Israel to judges in America is an apt application. It gives some food for thought in preparing a good sermon and his references are helpful and worth using for sermon prep thought or even in an actual sermon.I found that the NIVAC on Hosea/Amos/Micah offers explanations of the original text that read well, concepts for bridging into our lives that are well written AND a host of application thoughts and connecting ideas with scripture references. I think that Gary Smith's work in that NIVAC edition is a great match to this work by Waltke.In essence, the more technically minded you are, the more you will like Waltke's commentary. However, preacher beware. It will be difficult to develop life transforming applications with just Waltke's work. Get Gary Smith's or Elizabeth Achtemeier for more application development and I think you will connect more effectively with the 'average' person in the pew.My Hebrew instructor absolutely loves this commentary. I suppose he would give it a six star if that were possible. So really the only weakness is the application lack...which can be found in other tools. I recommend you add this volume to your library. Go ahead and stretch yourself!

I cannot believe they want $100 for this commentary on sale. It's about a $30 commentary in my opinion. After consulting this as a technical resource to solve a debate between two other commentaries on Hosea 1:2-9, I found no convincing argument in the passages he gives. I had to read it twice because it is so thick linguistically just to grasp what he was saying.Having said that, he gives way more than the other commentaries I have on a passage. For example, on the issue of whether God spoke to Hosea or in Hosea to those around him, MacIntosh gives an entire page! For technical details like that he is very helpful.On the meaning of the term 'prostitute' in Hosea 1:2 his argument is very technical, but may not take into account the typical historical setting.He gives Hebrew phrases in Hebrew fonts (great if you know Hebrew), but if you have a bit of vision difficulty, you will find the characters hard to see because the Hebrew fonts are small, and the pointers impossible to read.I would recommend that you borrow this commentary from a library rather than buy it. If it were reasonably priced, I would urge everyone who works seriously on Hosea to get a copy. Otherwise it's a four star book only because of the steep price.

When you shoot a basketball at this unit, it has the sound of a high quality system that is well designed. It handles shots from every angle well and we are generally happy with this product. I do have some fair criticisms of Lifetime, but that did not keep me from giving this basketball hoop system a five star. It is really a very very good system and we would buy it again even with the assembly hiccups we had.We bought this at local toy store for about $[...] less (on sale and with a special 20% off coupon). The regular price there is 199.On this model you need to plan on about 3-4 hours of assembly time if you are not a real whiz at these sort of things. Some less apt individuals may not want to try this. Make sure you have two 3/4" wrenches, two 1/2" wrenches, and two of any other sizes required (I think we needed 9/16" for one step). I found it easier to use one wrench and the matching deep well socket (there was one piece that I could not get without a deep well socket-I didn't have the size socket in my tool kit-so I ran out to a local hardware store and picked up a 9 piece deep well socket set for $9.99). I needed the sockets anyhow, so I didn't mind. The instructions don't tell you that, but you do need double wrenches or the sockets and you do need at least one deep well socket to do this job, and the manual missed that as well. The instructions say you need two adults at the end, but my nine year old son was enough to help me lift it into place. It might be too hard for someone with less strength (I'm just average in lifting power).I had the feeling that the manual was generally well thought out and written by people who have seen almost every error you can imagine. Still I had trouble keeping on top of all the details in the manual and had some trouble visualizing the steps. As far as manuals go, it was better than most for these type of projects, and there is a pdf copy on their website that is very easy to find and download. Nice job Lifetime on the website design. I liked that a lot.It would be GREAT if Lifetime would offer video clips for each step on their website. Then you could put your laptop next to the assembly area and watch the clip for the step you are on until you really grasp it.On the customer service, I have to give any company that sells recreational products or things that men generally assemble at home when they are not at work (evenings), a C at best if they are only open during banking hours. Lifetime's customer service is open LESS than my local bank! They close at 5pm MST. So I was unable to reach them when I had a question. Fortunately I figured out the issue on my own. But they get a C minus for not being available when most of their customers are likely to be assembling these units. What are they thinking about? Only their staff?The net is shorter than most nets and so they want you to order nets from them. I'm not sure that is necessary. The original net seems to be of a high quality. My sons initial reaction was that his new basketball hoop was better than all his friends. He was very excited to have this, and honestly I really loved the feel of this unit. It feels like a very high quality piece and we only paid $[...] total for the whole thing!One of the pics in the manual shows a foam wrap around the lower pole, but that did not come with the unit. Neither did a sticker to show raising and lowering of the height.We give this unit a five star. I believe it will last for many years based on the quality of materials. It has a five year warranty and I would guess that I won't have any parts break in five years. This seems like a great deal to me.The quality on the pieces (nuts/bolts) is high enough that everything fits together as they say in the manual. The materials and backboard are of a high quality and the entire assembly is slick in my opinion. We are very happy with this unit.One addendum to this review. We recently had a 60 mph windstorm knock this unit over onto our driveway. It was not damaged by the slamming onto our concrete drive and was easy to return to it's correct position. However, you might lay this on its side when storms come.With lots of wind in Illinois, we found that to keep this from tipping over you must fill the base with water & put two 70 pound bags of sand on the base. Then you have enough weight on it to hold it up in just about any storm.

Special olympics plot (approved by them) with some touching scenes, lots of insight into the special olympics. My kids love this movie...have seen it several times. There are a few language issues in this movie...so you need to actively parent this one.There's a romantic tension through the movie...competition, and comedy. The plot turns several times...unexpectedly...but yet it fits well with this movie...so it's not as contrived as many movies with unusual plots are. Our kids recommend it, I do too and think you will love this movie.

I'm a pastor who is working through Galatians for a sermon series. I'm also taking a grad class on Galatians right now, so I've been reading lots on this book...and studying the Greek text intensely. I heard from several people that Martyn's Galatians commentary was one of the best if not the best. I have to say I was surprised when I started reading it to see how fresh of a perspective he "brings to the table". For example, he starts off by viewing Galatians as if it were a drama. His explanations are memorable, poignant, and most important for pastors, preachable!He also has more information available than most teachers or preachers need.Let me illustrate: Jervis (NIBC Galatians) has a nice commentary with great comments throughout...150 pages. Martin Luther, FF Bruce, and R. Fung all have around 300 pages. Martyn's Anchor Commentary has over 600 pages on Galatians. On top of the additional information, he's relatively interesting to read because he says things differently than the rest and has fresh insight often. I have not read all of it, but what I have read it has been worth reading.I heartily recommend this volume for everyone who is working through the text of Galatians. It's a great one! At the very top of the list in my opinion...right next to Fung's NICNT on Galatians.

This book is the follow-up to the Natural Church Development book and test offered by Christian Schwarz and his national partners around the world. In some nations this book is distributed with the test results. There is controversy on whether or not this book is the best way to go for developing strategies to improve whatever your church minimum factor is (read Natural Church Development if you are unfamiliar with this terminology). My opinion is that it is very helpful when used by an experienced coach or in conjunction with other great tools like Robert Logan's resources.I have coached churches of all sizes (very large to very small), and I have found that this book is always helpful.There are two key areas of church health that this book deals with. First is with practical ideas on what to do for each of the 8 areas of health (Gift-Oriented Ministry, Inspiring Worship, etc....). The second is with principles that underlie these 8 areas. These principles are called biotics or 'life principles'. There are six of them and this book gives training exercises to help church leaders/pastors to think biotically...or to make decisions using life giving principles instead of copying other churches.So you can use it to train leaders on how to make decisions...or to train them on making decisions related to a specific area of church weakness (to strengthen your weak spot).I would recommend you purchase this book if you are not taking an NCD test. It will still help you if you work through it. If your nation gives this book free with test results, then you might want to wait until your test results are ready. But it's the kind of book that is worth giving away. I always direct pastors to this book when coaching them for NCD.I think if you are working on your church health or minimum factor, this book is worth reading or referencing.

This booklet is designed to give people who take an NCD test a simple overview of what NCD is all about. It can be used in a variety of contexts...giving leaders a quick introduction to NCD principles (NCD stands for Natural Church Development) or helping members who want to serve on a church health team to better understand what they are signing up for. Since it is so short, some of the technical depth is lacking.ABC's of NCD delivers what it promises. (The first page is IMO a little scholarly humor...just work through it...it's a joke...not serious). The rest of it is succinct and helpful. I have handed out hundreds of hese little booklets and people always seem to appreciate them.A lot of times I find people start reading this booklet and get very intersted in the NCD concepts. It helps to give this out when there are more materials available in case they want more. It's too short to answer many questions and is really a simple primer.The idea is to not hit people with a survery completely cold, but to give them some perspective to help them understand basically what the leaders in the church are doing with respect to an NCD survey.I highly recommend this tool.

In a concise, yet not weak manner the author argues for a theologically strong point, which is that the incarnation of Jesus Christ is the model for doing missions. (If Christology-the study of Christ and who Jesus is-is not the strength of evangelicalism, then I don't know what is.) The author comes from the position of Christ's incarnation as a model for missionary work. This is a highly challenging concept because he grapples with the tough applications drawn from passages like Philippians 2 which call us to have the same humility as Christ. He concisely draws from his own experience on an island in Micronesia, and from a wide array of cross cultural examples to make point after point building in a clear and logical format to convince us that the best approach to cross cultural ministry is to do what Jesus did. Leave heavens culture and become a Jewish baby.He says we should in a similar way leave our culture to embrace the culture we are reaching out to. So for a missionary to Taiwan from America, it means leaving Americanisms behind and embracing Asian culture as a baby would. The problem with this analogy that I'm still mulling over is precisely this: Jesus did not leave heavens culture to embrace our culture only. Yes he embraced our culture, but then He specifically called us to Heaven's kingdom (repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand). He came as one of us to call us to heavens culture. But missionaries who are called to leave their own country like America to Taiwan are not supposed to call Taiwan to American culture but to heavens culture. If his analogy was pushed in that direction the equivalent would be Americans saying change because America is here. Unfortunately we might actually be doing this in more instances than we realize. Anyhow, we are really supposed to be processing three cultures (not two). We have our old culture, heaven's culture and the culture of the people we are called to minister to. I didn't see him deal with this at all in his foundational premise for this book. the entire thought process was quite a distraction for me and I really wonder what the author thinks about this. So the analogies break down to a degree.I also kept thinking that Romans 6 would preach well with some of the concepts he was laying out. I would like to see the principles of Romans 6 developed as another chapter in this book. I believe Romans 6 would strengthen the authors points quite powerfully.Still this book is highly challenging. I think ya gotta read it! It's a great book. It made me think deeply and confronted selfishness in my soul. How many books actually do that?If you prayerfully read it with an open heart you will probably be rocked to the core. Especially if you are in missions or going on a missions trip or focused on another culture for ministry within your community.Interesting labels helped me remember his concepts. He takes the theological concept of the God-man (Jesus) and calls it 200% person. He then drives the point of a 150% person home...someone in two cultures 75% each. His ability to make a point stick in a few sentences or paragraphs is superior to most other authors I've read. Well done!If you are a missionary or considering it as a career, you ought to spend the few dollars and get this book. I recommend you start a notebook on it as I have to take copious notes for future study and teaching. It's that good of a book. I found the criticism leveled at this book in one rather harsh review to be unwarranted.One element I think ought to be explored more than this book does is how we are called to maintain a distinction between our native culture and the Kingdom of God's culture while embracing some elements of our target culture AND still calling them to personal abandonment of that culture to enter the Kingdom of God's culture. All of this while helping each culture 'culturalize' the gospel! That's a bit complicated, but isn't it what we are doing if we claim to bring the ancient truths of the faith in cultures around the world in a culturally relevant way?For those who are into the Insider movement, this book lays an interesting track down that you might find very interesting. Although I'm not involved with your movement, I do appreciate the balanced approach you must continually wrestle with and this book may help you stay focused on Christ in that process. Although I may not be in agreement with all the elements of the Insider movement, the concepts in this book ought to help you no matter where you stand on those issues. It is rooted in a very strong Christological focus which is my favorite topic in all theology. Perhaps that's precisely why I love this book.So I heartily recommend this book and am already asking other people I know to read it. I hope you do too.

An older revision of this was one of my Bible College textbooks in the early 1980's. It's way better now...and it was very good then. For example, Fee gives clear minded, thoughtful approaches to every type of literature (genre) in the bible.So many times as a pastor I hear someone make a statement about the meaning of a bible passage which is not what the passage is really about..only what they think it means. Fee basically helps people think through what the author of the passage meant for the readers it was actually written to...before we try to discern principles that apply to us.This is great for people who often say...'I feel it means'...because he gives sound common sense principles for understanding the bible. It should be required reading for church leaders and pastors. I also recommend it's companion, How to read the bible book by book. It's excellent as well....showing how to apply the principles from this book in every book of the bible. Finally, another book in this field worth reading is "Let The Reader Understand" by Clayton/McCartneyIf you write sermons, check out NT Exegesis by Fee.I hope you get this one and carefully read it and apply it to your life. You will be blessed if you do!

As a pastor who is not a scholar...but who has had enough Greek to use Greek NT Software tools in sermon exegesis, I found this book extremely valuable. I completely disagree with the reviewers who say you must be a scholar to use this tool. I don't even have a masters degree.In Gordon Fee's excellent NT Exegesis book he recommends consulting this book as part of the normal exegesis process for sermon or paper development. When attempting to translate the text, one needs to ascertain the text. If you've ever had the experience I have had of looking at the critical apparatus in the GNT and wondering how to decipher it, then this book will help you. It gives some background on each decision for the options.For example, a verse may have variations in the manuscripts. The committee who determined which manuscripts to follow made their decisions on the basis of some general rules for Textual Criticism. The actual basis for each decision in general is explained...usually in a sentence or two...for every single decision that appears in the apparatus for the GNT. So if you want to know the gist of what's going on with the ratings for each rating in the apparatus, you need this book. From that perspective it is a veritable gold mine. If you take time to verify the text before doing exegesis for either a sermon or a paper, then you cannot afford to ignore this volume.

I think that a book designed to teach math should have the right answers for the lessons. This book has a reputation among my son's classmates for having a lot of errors. For example a problem I just did with him wasm/-6 = 8. The text book says the answer is 48. The answer is -48. My sons comment was that he and his friends have found a lot of errors like this throughout this book.I recommend you do not buy this book. It also calls into question the editorial skills of Houghton Mifflin's division called McDougal Littell.It also says to me that the five star reviews for this book are either very generous or perhaps they have not really used this textbook.The reason I am marking the score so low (2 star) is because it is a textbook for math and the errors are math answers. That's terrible in my opinion-especially since it is not just one or two but a pattern showing a lack of care by the publisher.

This exegetical gem summarizes the key points in plain english for almost any pastor or teacher/student to use. Yet he carefully deals with the exegetical issues so that one gains insight from nuances of the Greek text. For example, in Philippians 3 Bruce gives footnotes for the term translated as refuse or dung in most versions. There are several key points like this for every paragraph throughout the book....but they are always footnoted at the end of each section so it is easy to read the regular comments...actually a joy in comparison to many commentaries which have a lot of technical information on almost every line. It reminds me of Moo's massive work on Romans (NICNT) except much shorter and stripped down to just the meat. He explains the Greek word and demonstrates it's significance in the footnotes for the paragraph. The regular comments are basically free of Greek terminology, so anyone can catch what he's saying. Yet as a pastor who exegetes the Greek NT for sermons on a regular basis I found his comments are as insightful as any other commentary I've read on Philippians. So if one is short of time and unable to read the longer commentaries like Fee or Silva, then this concise volume will help you identify and assess and interpret the key issues for every paragraph.So the way I use this volume is for the exegetical portion of sermon development when I do not have a lot of time. If one is behind in their sermon development he can help you catch up with a minimum of reading (ever been there?). For application, he has many kernals that are good, but his phraseology doesn't preach as well as some other commentators like Thielman or Motyer who seem to provide 'preachable' terminology more frequently in my experience. For more indepth exegetical treatment this volume is a bit scant, so I turn to O'Brien's NIGTC and Fee's NICNT for that...which are both quite a bit more indepth than Bruce. But can one afford to ignore Bruce on a topic? I think not. The right place to use this book is for the exegesis portion of sermon/teaching development only when one is short on time and cannot read the more indepth exegetical works.He handles things objectively and insightfully....and when the other scholars vary from his view, I've learned to think carefully about why because they may not be correct when at odds with this brilliant scholar. For the pastor who doesn't read Greek, this commentary is exceptionally helpful and should be one of the most referred to volumes while working through Philippians.It is a well done and to the point book that I recommend if you are studying Philippians or Paul's life and ministry.

When one of my daughters announced this was the best movie she had seen in awhile, and that I needed to see it, i reluctantly agreed to join in and watch. Some of the scenes had a cheese factor that I could not help laughing out loud at, but was stunned to see my wife and daughters not laughing at all...and intrigued to see my response. We pressed on.I think the story line of the movie is somewhat predictable...at least I guessed the ending shortly into the movie and was hushed quickly by one of the kids who had seen it.Still, there were many great family scenes that depict problems lots of families have including misunderstanding motives of close family members and what children really want from their family. I found one scene after another quite entertaining (and that's really the idea in movies isn't it?).By the time we were done, I felt our family was closer to one another and a good mood and tone was set for our Memorial Day Holiday Week-end.Without giving away the plot, I would like to just say that this movie is above average as far as movies go. I think that most Dads need to watch this movie with an open mind. We all can learn something from it. Guys raising early teens probably need to watch this more than most people. It seems to connect with pre and early girl teens the most.I will probably watch it again sometime in the next year with my whole family. I recommend this movie as an above average family oriented flick. Enjoy it!

This is a 29 page booklet sub-titled 'Establishing a sense of belonging". The authors write convincingly about the need to focus on immediate and practical bonding for new missionaries. They define bonding using illustrations from nature about mother and baby bonding process that's developed immediately after birth.Included in my copy of this booklet is another booklet on the flip side (upside down too). It's titled Language Learning IS Communication-IS Ministry. It's by the same authors. The argument is aptly summed up in the title. He argues that by learning the language a missionary is doing effective ministry. It's a similar argument to the opening thoughts in another book I'm reading right now too. I think it's generally a solid book. All missionaries or students preparing to be missionaries will benefit from reading these two booklets.For the money I would like to see a lot more material. Otherwise it's a five star.

Guys-this is a pretty safe movie to get for a date with your wife.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale play the roles of Jonathan and Sarah exceptionally well. The story line lacks credibility in several places, but it's unique and packs some good surprises.The basic paradigm of this movie rests on the fallacies of new age world views, and the movie takes several swipes at those very paradigms...but then goes on to prove it's true. So as a Christian, I would point out that this is only entertainment...and that people should not put their lives into the hands of the mystery of fate (as Serendipity teaches by inference).Now that I've said that....let me say that we probably will watch this movie again. It gives you a good feeling and has a great ending. Both actors are enchanting and the whole experience is a positive one.

As a pastor developing sermons from the Greek text, I find a lot of the exhortations by Luther to be refreshing and motivating. His introduction and many other comments are worth reading. This is a commentary that I would recommend you borrow, maybe not purchase.The big drawback is that the exegesis is hundreds of years old and is not complete. So even though we have a rare look at the great Martin Luther's work on Romans, it doesn't give a lot on some passages. For example perhaps the greatest passage in all of the bible (according to many many pastors) is Romans 3:21-31.Here this commentary only has pgs 76 to 80 (only four pages for the greatest paragraphs in the bible?) for this part of Romans. Let me give you the sum total of what he says about Romans 3:24.24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,Luther says "God does not justify us freely by His grace in such a way that he did not demand any atonement to be made, for He gave Jesus Christ into death for us, in order that He might atone for our sins. So now He justifies freely by His grace thos who have been redeemed by His Son.Really! That's all he says in his commentary on Romans about the verse that introduces the concept of legal righteousness for the first time! Because of that I slowly stopped using this commentary for exegesis. It's just not that helpful...and I was so excited about this book for that reason initially.Doug Moo in his NICNT commentary on Romans deals with vs 24 quite thoroughly...with about four full pages with extensive footnotes on the same text vs 2 sentences in Luther. The contrast is that Moo draws out the first distinctive use of the Greek word for justify here as a reference not to making righteous...but rather to declare as righteous (in a real legal standing). This significant point is essential to a correct understanding of the book of Romans. So if you are actually studying Romans, I would urge you to purchase Moo (NICNT). If you are a history student looking at how Luther shaped history, then this commentary translated by Mueller is essential.Basically I think Luthers commentary will help many people devotionally and one should refer to it. Just if you are a bible teacher/preacher...don't think you are going to gain exegetical insight very often from this commentary. It's really not that kind of 'commentary'. Hope that helps!

This book is worth getting if you are like me...and have a tendency to be critical of others. It will give you many practical tips on how to encourage others. Most of them are simple and effective. One way a family can use this book is to have one tip each week of the year. Since there are 52, it can be used all year.Sometimes kids think the ideas are funny, but still it makes them think through the idea of encouraging others, which is very healthy. This book is a bargain.

As a pastor who sees Maccabees as Apocryphal, and extremely interesting background material for the Jewish culture and heritage backdrop of the New Testament, I was excited to start reading this translation of Maccabees. Just like my trusty NEB, this follows in the same tradition of what I would label as a 'startlingly fresh' translation. When compared to the Anchor Bible's translation by Jonathan Goldstein, this is far superior.Just for the translation of the text alone, this is worth acquiring.In the comments, which are about two pages for every page of text, the author, John Bartlett gives some technical information (usually it is helpful and crucial to understanding the text). He avoids enumerating endless textual critical theories (I'm very grateful for that). He sometimes gives inspiring links to similar accounts.Let me illustrate what I mean.Take 2 Maccabees 6 on Eleazar's martyrdom as an example: This famous story of the Jewish elderly man has the NEB translation (I just love it). Then he starts in with two pages of comments. In his notes he mentions that the Greek behind the NEB's 'clemency' vs.22 is the Greek word philanthropia and ties this to royal privileges given to the Jews by the Syrian King. It's just enough to stir the thinking reader onward. He ties into Daniel 12 and the Wisd of Sol 3.1 pm torment. He also discusses how this links into chapter 7.His comments are helpful.Unlike my other commentaries on Eleazar, Bartlett makes a helpful comparison to Polycarp's martrydom, drawing a link to the Apostolic Fathers and Maccabees. I found that stimulating and inspiring.The indexes in the back are weak with no scripture index at all!!!! There is a defense of reading apocryphal books in the back, designed for protestants like myself.Honestly this book is way over priced. If I found it in a bookstore, I would not pay over $8 or $10 for it. It's an inexpensive paperback binding from the 1970s. Fonts are just ok and there is little footnote/cross referencing for further study.So, in short, this is one of my favorite commentaries on Maccabees 1 & 2, especially because of the translation of the text and some of the inspiring elements in the comments. I recommend it for pastors, bible teachers and students working on papers. If you are into textual criticism, look to Goldstein's Anchor Bible Commentary on II Maccabees instead.

This text book is also digitally integrated into the professional grade bible exegesis software program called BibleWorks 7.0. What Futato has done is to take the lessons from the text book, add links, and steps that help you use B-Hebrew in BibleWorks from about the third lesson into the grammar. This means you can start using your software to study the bible (or at least to look some basic things up in Hebrew) right away.There is an online grading service (which I did not enroll in). I have a tutor who has found Futato's material easy to teach through. As the title of the book says, it is not a Complete or Advanced Grammar, it is a Basic Hebrew Grammar. So some rarely or never used features of the language are deleted from the lessons. This helps one focus on the crucial points.Essentially he boils Biblical Hebrew down to about 20 lessons.This breathes hope into a new student...it seems easier than B-Greek for example.The digital version of the book also sports recordings of the vocabulary for each lesson, as well as recordings of phrases and other crucial Hebrew texts. I have several Hebrew Grammars, but this digital version of the book listed here has quickly become my favorite one. Principally because it is so very easy to use.One drawback is that the pronunciations given in the software are not always authentic. Some of these pronunciations may be for training emphasis, but still the emphasis is sometimes on the wrong syllable. For this I would mark the product down a star, but that is only the digital version (which is actually not listed here). So I give it a five star.Great product. Thank you Mark for making this one!

This complex book that is very simply and powerfully presented in visual and literary form gives the pastor and consultant the foundation of the NCD change process to help Christians/Churches mature no matter what their background or paradigm. One of the things I love about this little book is that you can capture the concepts by simply looking at the visuals for a few seconds. BTW-this is a paperback book.His premise is that the way each person of the Holy Trinity is revealed to us is unique. These unique expressions of God have captured the attention of different wings of the church. By helping each wing of the Church (Mainline, Evangelical (non Charismatic) and Pentecostal/Charismatic) identify their focus on one or two persons in the Holy Trinity, Schwarz attempts to bring all believers to a focus on all three persons of the Godhead.The beauty of this approach is that it does seem to pinpoint clear and obvious weaknesses of each wing of the church...for example...he says that Churches focused on the Son of God, the Redeemer, sometimes may err by becoming dogmatic. The strength of their movement emphasized to an extreme (the Word/Salvation) can become dogmatism. His proposal is that these churches would benefit by adding some emphasis on the power of the Holy Spirit and the justice/mercy of God as Father. This, he proposes would also help those churches understand and connect with churches in the other wings of Christianity. He gives examples for every wing of Christianity and every combination of those wings.It is a fascinating approach.My thought (and not mine only), is that an overlaying perspective that emphasizes Christ on top of this healthy foundation, is what Paul may be getting at in his clear emphasis on 'In Christ' throughout his epistles. That is another topic for further development in a deeper book.This book is a foundational book. It is followed up with tests that can help a person identify which person in the Godhead they most focus on...and then to develop a plan to mature. This flows through into the gifts of the Holy Spirit (see 3 Colors of Ministry book) and into relationships (see 3 Colors of Love book).Pastors, I recommend you use this book to help your congregation mature in her view of God. I recommend para-church ministries and Christian school administration use this book to train your staff to minister more effectively to people from various wings of the church. I recommend that School administrators and theology professors use the concepts in this book to develop curriculum for Christian schools and Colleges everywhere. It would make a huge difference in developing unity among Christians everywhere. I recommend church consultants apply the information in this book when crossing outside of your background into other wings of the church, and in assisting your church to become more balanced.This is one of the best books for pastors I have ever read. I heartily recommend it.

yes I love this CD. Especially great are song #3 and #7. Our radio stations have been playing Sweetly Broken for months and it's very popular. It is a great song. But I have to say that I love song #3 even more. It's my favorite song right now. This song is about awe of God in worship. It's about His grace. The musical tambre and vocal qualities express broken, humble and passionate intensity that is rare. It's a GREAT song.I first heard this song #3 Stand in Awe at a conference in California. I was sent a free copy of this cd (cuz I'm a pastor I guess) and I started listening to it. Between the conference (where Jeremy led it live) and this cd I have been blessed over and over.We keep this cd in our car right now and are listening to it on the way to the church office every day....and I've found that I can listen to Stand in Awe three times in a row and want to hear it again (am I hooked or what?). I don't like any of the other songs nearly as well, but most of them are really good. I just don't listen to a lot of worship songs repeatedly...but this one I can't get enough of right now.FWIW-I studied music at Wheaton Conservatory of Music for a year before switching to pastoral training in college. I think I do have a good ear for musical quality..and Riddle has a raw and humble quality to his vocals that really fit well with worship music. I give this cd a five star.

I cannot believe that this high quality short commentary on Romans (260 pages) has no reviews. It's one of my favorite commentaries on Romans. After moving overseas on a missionary assignment it was one of the first books I had shipped over.It is also on Dr. Doug Moo's short list of 'required commentaries' on Romans if you take his Romans course at Wheaton College. That's because it's truly one of the best books on Romans in print.Although it's a shorter commentary, his comments are densely packed with 'meat to chew on'. Dr. Stuhlmacher has written 16 excursuses. He has a fresh and helpful insight in every pericope. Pastors and scholars alike should consult it. It's also a must read for students working on papers in Romans.Recently I heard some trouble-some teachings in the name of Romans 13:1-7. So I dug out all my tools on Romans and began to study just that section. Everyone of the commentaries gave me things to think about-as my own research in the text also did. However, in Stuhlmacher's work I found tucked into the comments on Romans 13 a few pages of his excursus on Christian living in relationship to the government of Rome and the Jewish legal system. The article expresses a pithy yet fully mature body of thought worthy of detailed study. So not only are his exegetical comments really good. But his extras are wonderfully refreshing to read.Let me illustrate with some detail: In this excursus he has 3 key points that follow this introductory statement:Rom 13:1-7 is indeed a very important passage. But it is not the only text which must be taken into consideration in order to observe the way to which Paul desired to see the life of Christians regulated under the power of the state.He then cites issues from Paul's own life with a focus on Acts 22/25 and 2 Corinthians 11. He discusses Paul's fine balancing act of being a Roman citizen and also a Jew. It's a well written, finely tuned summary.His second point focuses on the Corinthian situation with a focus on 1 Cor 6 and 2 Cor 6. Here the 'saints' are called on to distance themselves from the state by taking care of business in house. It's kind of the opposite or a very different circumstance than what they had just across the sea at Rome.His final point deals with a more thorough theology of New Testament texts on the entire topic. He brings in Luther and Barth's unique perspectives on this (they are not the same as each other) and ties in a range of scripture passages. This little aside has 15 others like it scattered through this commentary.I think that these excursuses alone are worth close to the cost of this book.After having studied the passage and reading a few other commentaries and their exegetical comments on Romans 13:1-7, I found Stuhlmacher's stance that Romans 13:1-7 is an integral part of the flow of thought on the basis of language links to the portions before and afterwards to convincing. He convinced me more quickly of his position than any other person I've read on the question of whether or not Romans 13:1-7 is a genuine Pauline pericope or if it was added later by another author. Stuhlmacher argues very convincingly that Paul wrote it as part of the original text. No wonder Dr. Moo required this book.No wonder I keep referring to it year after year.For many other reasons which I cannot mention right now due to time constraints, I heartily urge you to add this volume to your collection on Romans.[...]

As a pastor working on sermons in 2 Peter, I've found this commentary is a mixed bag. It brings to the table some fresh perspective that is helpful and yet in that very helpful mix are simple statements as if they are factual that completely skip over other very likely options. Let me illustrate.In discussing the list of virtues in 2 Peter 1:5-7 Lucas and Green (note this is NOT the major commentator Gene Green from Wheaton-this author is Christopher Green. He is a pastor in Surrey England), a helpful discussion about the Greek verb used to book-end the passage is laid out. I didn't find that clearly spelled out anywhere else. Yet in the discussion of what each virtue actually means I found some comments to be very weak. For example, the discussion on the word GNOSIS (Knowledge), the authors contend that it means information about Jesus. Contrary to this, Gene Green contends that it means personal and relational knowledge of Jesus rather than philosophical information about Jesus. Lucas and C. Green appeal to a Scottish commentator (John Brown) multiple times with very few references to any other authors who have written on Peter when dealing with this critical passage.I think that it is dangerous to use this work as the ONLY tool to assist you in studying 2 Peter or Jude. I urge you to check their exegesis against Davids, G. Green, Schreiner or even Witherington.Yet, this shorter commentary is easy to read and follow, and if you do compare it to other well written works, you will see where they tend to get off track (in my opinion) right away. This commentary is helpful for coming up with ways to present a passage that others tend to miss. This commentary is also good at tying everything to the overall purpose of the letter, as well as from time to time giving sound reasons for rejecting some ideas that might otherwise tend to suggest themselves to the careless reader.It's a four star volume worthy of adding to your library in my view.

I completely disagree with the reviewer who skeptically states that the way to get rich is to translate the bible into modern english...and that the NRS is sufficient. I'm a pastor...and I study the bible every week for sermons...in the greek text. I use as many english versions as I can because each one contributes something to a better insight of the text.The Message is one of the ones I make a serious effort to read weekly because Dr. Peterson always has a fresh angle on the greek text. His stuff reads like the way Americans talk in common every day language. It's fast to read and fun.Here's how he handles the most famous verse in the bible...John 3:16. He says "This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed, but believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life.That's a fresh view of the text that makes you think...rather than coursing through it like one would do if they had read it many times before.I was given this version or edition of the message by my in-laws a few years ago...and I still use it a lot. I would recommend you purchase a copy for personal use or as a gift for someone.The only thing I don't like about it is the absence of verse markers....but another edition has solved that problem.So it's a five star product.

This grammar works very well as a training tool for teaching or studying basic NT Greek. Each lesson is laid out very logically with enough work to help you develop your skill without overwhelming you.The methodology is very simple. Vocabulary with a simple point and some memorization work to help you grasp the concept for that lesson.It is easier to teach through than other basic grammars I have looked at, simply because of it's focus.I would like to say that those who have criticized it for the 8 case system may be correct...but I like the 8 case system because it gives beginning students a stronger intuitive sense that context does drive a lot of meaning in Greek. That is important for students to understand.It is a great text book, designed to take 2 semesters for an average student.Learning NT Greek is not hard. You can do it. This text book is one of the better options you have. A different pathway that helps you accomplish the same task is Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. I happen to like the approach of Summers a little better. Both of those two Grammars are high on my list. I also recommend FDB (Funk's Grammar) and A.T. Robertson.Finally, the verb chart is handy to have, but not necessary since they are now standard in most software programs for NT Greek...including BibleWorks 7.0 which I have and love.I hope you enjoy Summers textbook as much as I have.

I found this little layman's commentary on the poets and prophets of the Old Testament recently in my library. Here are a few pro's and cons with this book. Pro's: It is very easy to read and avoids technical jargon that most people studying the bible are unfamiliar with. It is helpful in guiding a scholar on how to communicate with 'regular' people. Every passage I have looked at has been enhanced in my mind by Stedman's take on the passage.Con's: He doesn't bother to tell you that some of his statements are very controversial. So if you are only using one commentary, this one is not the one. For example, in Micah, many commentators divide Micah into five or six parts. Some divide it into three, but caution that there are problems with this division of the book. Stedman simply says that Micah easily divides into three parts and presents it as a well accepted fact.Another example from Micah: Stedman says that both the Assyrian AND the Babylonian invasions are in mind in Chapter 1. I don't think all commentators would agree with this. He may be correct, but again the reader here has no clue that the statement may be debated. So bible teachers and preachers beware. This is a good supplement to your research, but you need to verify his conclusions on your own.Still, I find I'm using it more and more. He has great phrases that connect well with people. He makes tough passages seem clear. I like the commentary overall.

This movie is generally fine for the whole family. It's really funny,has a good plot and is hard to stop watching...even the second or third time through. There are several 'comical' scenes where gender confusion is introduced. For families who care about religious values, some of those scenes may bother them. Also, it may be offensive actually to people who are in favor of alternative lifestyles, because in this movie those traits are laughed at.The plot of greed being a force to destroy people is a healthy and instructive plot for young people to learn. The idea that one must go for the big dream in their heart or they will live to ever regret it is emotionally palpable and very effective.This movie should be seen by everyone!

This little commentary is actually well written, balanced, and helpful for a student or bible teacher who needs some assistance and doesn't have a lot of time. Vaughan seems to capture the correct analysis of each passage I have looked at, without a lot of time spent on the minutia. Let me give you an example. In 1 John 2:1 & 2 Vaughan handles the debate between various scholars on what the word 'ilasmos' (propitiation or expiation) means. In a few paragraphs he gives a better overview of this topic (at least it is easier to follow) than I have read in any other commentary. He points to the champions of the various views and explains the weaknesses and strengths of their views in a convincing way. His conclusion is convincing. All in a half page. If you are a person who has to take the commentators thoughts and try to boil them down in a way that is easy for others to understand, then this little book is a great one! If you can find a copy, pick it up. I'm using it along-side of the great ones like Smalley and Strecker.I was very disappointed with this generally well written study guide commentary, to find a popular myth about biblical Greek and the definition of love parroted in his section on 1 John 4:7-10. This glorious section on agape deserves a more accurate description. Here's a little of what I mean.Is there anything more important than love? Isn't loving one another the primary focus of real Christianity? Why have I heard misinformation about love from books and pulpits all my life? What's the deal?I've heard for years that there are three kinds of love in Greek, philia, eros and agape. Once again I read this in my study of 1 John for my sermon prep this week in an otherwise well written commentary. The common idea is that agape is God's love, outside of human beings ability or containment. It is a selfless love. Philia is brotherly or family love. The love of friendship. Eros is not a biblical term, and includes baser human desires perhaps better classified as lust.So I was quite stunned when I found out in my pastors study years ago that is NOT accurate.Let me first just list the Greek nouns I've found in the Semantic Domain that includes 'Love, affection, Compassion'.Philia (love for someone or something based on association with them)Philadelphia/os (brotherly love)Philanthropia (love of mankind)Philandros (a wife's love for her husband)Philoteknos (a parents love for their children)Philautos (love for yourself)Philotheos (love for God)Philostorgos (love for close relatives)Agape (love for someone or something-showing a high regard for them or it)Zelos (to have a deep concern or compassion for someone or something)Epipotheo (to experience a yearning affection for someone - 'to have a great affection for, to have a yearning love for)Splankna (deep affection or compassion)'Platuno Ten Kardian' (idiom meaning to broaden the heart)Embrimaomai (to have an intense, strong feeling of concern, often with the implication of indignation)Sumpathes {You have one guess to figure this one out-no second chance sympathy if you cannot figure it out :-)}If you combine all the phil stem words into one basic word, there are still eight kinds of love listed (not three).Further examination shows that some of these words have a massive overlap in usage. For example, philia and agape are used for similar or identical situations in many places.Since love is so very important to define, I believe a fresh look at just the basic lexicons and dictionaries on these words and how they are used is demanded for us. Especially in light of the discovery that there are not three basic words for love in the bible's Greek. 8 are listed, and eros is not one of them.The word Eros is the name of the Greek mythological god of love. See a quick definition of eros from Wikipedia. Eros ('''' &eacute;r's) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Modern Greek word "erotas" means "(romantic) love". The term erotic is derived from eros.http://ntjohnsletters.blogspot.com/ for a little more on this and notes on John's letters.

I'm trying to learn Mandarin and do not have second language acquisition training, so please consider this review as from an amateur. I've been trying out a number of products, including youtube videos that are free, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, and a mix of other products. I just don't agree with the reviews posted on this product so I thought I'd write my own review. You know a lot of people give Rosetta Stone a higher rating than this product, but these phrases on this cd are far more helpful. I didn't see any soccer balls or elephants in Taiwan (lesson 1 on Rosetta). I did ride in a taxi a lot...and this product gets to that in the first half hour. One has to remember that this product is only about 10 bucks, so it's kind of unfair to be too harsh on the level of training it offers in my opinion.I was just in a taxi in Taiwan a few weeks ago and the driver did not know English. I did not know Chinese. So it was difficult. They teach phrases in this cd that would have helped me out tremendously. These lessons are very short and can be repeated often. Before I return to Taiwan I will know these lessons well, believe me! Most of the lessons seem pretty easy to me.In essence, if you have had a few basic Chinese lessons in any other method, this cd can function as a quick review of words in broken down into helpful categories. For example, numbers. They have a 5 and a half minute overview of numbers. If you have had a slower lesson on numbers with some other program, but don't know the numbers yet, this is a very handy way to focus on them. And they say basically listen to the chapter over and over until you get em down well.I don't think there is anything wrong with the Mandarin pronunciation on this CD. It's excellent. It's clear and if you know the four tones, you should be able to discern what the tone is for most words the first time.Honestly for me after listening to the other ways of teaching for about 20 hours now, I find this method a nice, quick overview that is a refreshing break from the other approaches. The reason I like it is that they give each word just once. So if you have any exposure to the word or phrase it's a nice review. However, some of the phrases are too long for a first timer and I think some of the criticism on some of the reviews does hit on something. It's just overly negative in my mind. So I give this product a 4 star. It's worth the price they are asking and it delivers on what they promise in the promo literature only if you have some Chinese from another method that breaks things down more slowly first. IF you have that (I like Pimsleur the best) then this is a very nice addition. If this is the only product you plan to use, I would not get it. You would be better served getting the introductory level for Pimsleur.I hope this review helps you out as you try to learn Mandarin.

The design on these is simple, and it works better than I was led to believe by some of the reviewers here. There are a couple problems to be aware of though.1) The base is a thick plastic material which may crack over time, but has held up so far. There are thirteen nail holes in each shoe, with hex shaped heads that enable the 13 nails with hex heads to fit in easily. I think they should provide a few extras in each box, but they don't. They provide a little stamped metal tool to tighten each nail into place. A deep well socket driver would work too. You can assemble this during commercials on any football or baseball game. Pretty easy. (There are not really any instructions with this, so if you are terrible at assembling things, you might not get it. (90% should get this on their first try in my opinion).2) The nails sink into the lawn (whether weeds, or grass or dirt easily. However, if you have dead patches of lawn, it may pull up clumps of dead vegetation if it is loose. Just kick it off if that happens. I don't agree with the guy who said they don't penetrate dry lawns. He may have really tough soil.3) I disagree with the guy who said they were hard to walk in. That has not been our experience at all.4) The straps that stretches over the arch of the foot doesn't reach. Because of this, I had to have my son, who is only 9 years old, put the shoes on (they were a little too large for his shoes, but they did hold on loosely). He, at age 9, was able to walk in the shoes pretty easily and they sank into the lawn everywhere he walked. They pulled out easily. So all turned out well. He actually seemed to enjoy it. I was able to do some walking in these, but with the over strap not secure, they felt like they were going to come off after 5-10 minutes.I am average height, 5'10" and wear a size 10 shoe. The over strap was about 4" too short. I tried every position they offer. They ought to come with a longer or adjustable strap. The little toe strap held it on...but I was pretty frustrated with the whole unable to get them to fit deal.If you have the right size feet (I imagine a size 7 mens or smaller might work) this is a lot cheaper than the aerator rental machines, and I think they actually do a nicer job because you get more lawn punctures (and smaller punctures) per square foot. I like the concept, but did they test this product on average American men or only on a typical Asian?

This grammar uses a different system for breaking down words in Greek. So if you teach first year Greek and have learned your paradigms in the older methods that were common (Machen, Summers, etc...) you better spend some time in this before using it in the classroom.I like this grammar a lot for people who are studying Greek to read the bible. It gives you the 314 most commonly used NT words...and around 30 lessons...so you are not learning words which never appear in the Greek NT. If you plan to read other Greek material, then this may not be as great of a method. It is focused on the NT vocabulary. After two semesters a student should be able to navigate eighty percent of the Greek NT using this method. That's about as fast as one can possibly gain competency.The binding and pages are laid out in nice fonts and durable material. It's a sound method and I really love this book. Get a copy if you can!

I'm a 46 yr old guy who rarely cries during movies. And most of the plot on this movie I figured out from the start...sort of. There were some surprises, but I found myself drawn in by the combination of tensions that climax in a 'typical' football movie. The Christian theme is simple, powerful and refreshing. I've watched this movie twice this week, bought a copy for my family to watch with me, and will probably show it to our church sometime this year.The reasons I like this movie are:There are no famous hollywood actors! Yet it is still fun to watch.Hundreds of people volunteered to help make this movie.It has no profanity. No sex scenes.The production is really pretty good.There are a number of one liners that are actually worth writng down.The don't give up theme could help people who are facing discouragement of almost any kind. This is a good movie to show cancer patients or people trying to have children, or people who are struggling with a rough financial or marriage situation, or just about any kind of situation that seems hopeless. It teaches you to cry out to God and to praise Him no matter what happens in life, win or lose. It's a great coaches training tool for any sports coach.My favorite theme in this movie is: Give God your best and praise Him whether you win or lose.The little credit scenes after the movie are some of the best ones because you feel like these guys who made this movie are just a bunch of regular Americans who love God.Go for it on this movie. You will love it. I actually cried towards the end, as cheesy as it sounds, but I was deeply touched. I rarely cry in movies (once every fifteen years or so).I think God inspired this movie. I hope you get touched by Him as you watch it.

This is a great tool for the student working on Hebrew text and preaching in English. However, the used book sellers are asking almost double what the publisher charges for a new copy of this volume. I find the prices here a to be a real gouge. Why should we pay $32 for a book that the publisher lists the retail price at $18 and is selling for $17 to the public?This book has a lot of helpful Hebrew language information laid out in a very readable form. For example, in Micah 1 the author summarizes with helpful detail the play on words that exists for several verses. To a non-Hebrew reader, this is very helpful because the commentaries do not give a thorough summary (at least the ones I've read) which conveys the broadness and linguistic impact of these 'puns'. The bottom line is that this tool gives a very helpful Hebrew snapshot for any English reader. Exceptionally well done.I ought to point out that the author is a Rabbi, so that ought to be borne in mind with respect to Christologically oriented prophecies.

I've been pastoring for about 10 yrs...do sermon prep in the Greek text and try to bring the text in a relevant way to my congregation. This book has a ton of great error checkers for those who work with any Greek at all.For example, the Root Word fallacy section...Carson deals with issues that have bothered me for a long time. One of the most famous is the AGAPE is a special kind of God's love...that is different from PHILEO. Think with me on this for a minute...if the devil could get pastors to miss the biblical definition on the most important virtue in the bible...then he has shifted their entire ministry off base to a degree. That is what has happened in America today with so many bible teachers/preachers appealing to the Greek meaning of Agape as different from Phileo...Carson calls the approach a root fallacy...in other words the root meaning of the word reveals the true meaning of the word.One of his illustrations is "Good-bye" which originally was 'God be with ye'. He points out that no one is thinking today 'God be with ye' when they are saying Good-bye....it is a similar thing to probe for the root meaning of the Greek word and then try to bring a revelation out that 'changes' the translation to something deeper, more spiritual. It's really a twisting of the text into a wrong definition.Agape is frequently used to describe lots of feelings outside of God's love. The popular teaching that Agape is God's love...that it means unconditional love...whereas Phileo means brotherly love doesn't stand up if you do a basic word study in the bible of the two words. When I was first in the ministry I was stunned to find that word studies in the LXX & GNT did not back up this very popular teaching-that Agape is God's unconditional love...and Phileo is human love...of a lower grade. Almost everyone in my congregation had heard that popular teaching somewhere...either on Christian radio, books, magazines, or TV. But in fact, it seemed that the two words for love were used interchangeably a lot. Not only that...agape is used in one place to describe a rapists feelings for his victim!!!! (This is very hard to believe for people who have only heard the pop definition of agape. But before you give me a poor review for saying this, just check your Greek LXX to see the first use of Agapaw. 2 Samuel 13:4 uses this term, and then describes how he went on to actually rape Tamar). How could that be God's unconditional love? Something is very wrong with the popular teachings on love today.I discovered this in my own word studies of love and was stunned. Then, I found it referenced in D.A. Carson's book here. Carson makes this point to show how false definitions once popularized can lead to eisegesis unless we do our own homework. It is really kind of scarey when I hear pastors of large evangelical churches and popular radio/tv preachers give false definitions to some of the most important concepts in all of Christianity...and with such apparent authority! So how do we avoid clear error on such important issues as agape love?To my delight, Carson shows how to identify these sorts of errors. The book is a little hard to understand in some places because he packs so much into each paragraph, but if you find the issue you are working on and read his stuff slowly, it should alter the way you approach God's word (if your approach is flawed).One really cannot get to a more important issue than dealing with a definition of love...can we?Some of the criticism about negativity in this book is probably fair...but there is so much linguistic nonsense out there being taught in the name of spirituality, it's tough to deal with it all in a 'positive' way. I just think all pastors should read and more importantly learn to apply this book when doing exegesis for sermons.Hope you get two copies and give an extra one to a pastor friend.

If you are looking for an innovative, unusual gift that will be used over and over again, this may be it. This practical cookbook has virtually everything you could want to develop true, authentic Italian cuisine without much effort.One of the key reasons I developed an interest in this is because my wife and I love Italian restaurants in our city. Not only that, but I discovered that heart disease and cancer rates are lower among Italians who live in Italy than they are in Italians who live in America who have shifted to an American diet. Italy is part of the 'Mediterranean Diet' countries who have this research behind them. So by using this cookbook, one can develop a 'Mediterranean Diet' while having fantastic Italian cuisine.Each page is developed with one menu item...instructions so easy that even a guy who doesn't cook (that's me) can make a menu item with ease.Most of the ingredients are really easy to find. The items taste great, and I think most cooks would actually truly appreciate this as a Christmas gift. So add it to your shopping list if you haven't finished buying yet. You gotta try this out as an item.You won't regret it. Five stars in my view.

Hey...I have to take exception to the Amazon review on this movie. I'm not a Bill Murray die hard fan...in fact it's 2005 and I just saw this movie for the first time. It was so funny that I ended up watching most of it a second time with some of my kids. I think the plot is interesting because it mixes two opposite situations...one is an entertainment theatre for regular people...and the other is an international peace/sabotage deal with England and Russia. The actress who plays with Bill Murray is beautiful...does a great job and enhances his part well. Bill Murray does a great job also...but I think the movie itself is interesting as a concept even without Murray.For kids, there is a recurring section in the movie that has hints of S/M, and I didn't like having my seven year old see that scene and the comments that went with it...nor the little comment that had a hint of homosexual preference in it during the middle of the movie...nor the use of God's name in vain....for those who are sensitive to those things...and there are many out there...know that those things are in this movie...but it's not heavy...only a few passing references.I think Bill Murray is the same guy who did Ground Hog day...and this movie is probably about as good as that one in my view. It's funny...and you may want to watch it several times over the years....and he gets the girl in the end....so even some 'light romance mixed into the deal'.I'd watch it again and I recommend it.

This comedy had everyone in our family laughing most of the way through it. Kids loved it because all the 'stars' of this movie had super powers...each one was unique. So it made for dazzling (if not cheezy) extra effects. My seven year old loved this movie...he would give it a five star. For adults it was good, but you can predict the plot throughout...so it's not very imaginative...but for a family flick it's really good.

I have edged my yard with this tool for a few years now.Positives on this edger: It is light and easy to maneuver. It cuts a great line, that is adjustable in depth. The kick on this unit does not come near your face, a nice safety feature. It's easy to pull backwards to go over a spot if a grass blade or weed stem remains. The metal blade is extremely durable and will last for years unless you try to route your driveway with it. The third wheel adjustability adds a nice tweak to the job, complete with a measuring guide on it to make the finished product virtually idiot proof.Most in my neighborhood do not edge. So in a few minutes my sidewalk and driveway looks pretty good. Of those who do edge, most of them have no clear dirt line. In response to this some products can be set to cut a very wide (trench) line. One tool can't do both, so one neighbor has to trench his sidewalks and then backfill them with dirt in order to get a nice sharp edge. With this tool, just move the lever from trench to edge (which takes about 3 or 4 seconds), and there is no need to backfill because you have a perfect edge line.Here are some common mistakes to avoid, which may even explain a few of the reviewers who give this a low review. Some of these tips help me get done faster with the job.1) Keep the power cord over your shoulder so it doesn't fall out all the time. One tug on it and it unplugs...2) Set the blade depth to edge (not trench) or it won't make a deep clean edge line. Swing the lever out a half inch before adjusting or it remains locked. I get the feeling from reading a few reviews that those guys never figured that out. Don't be afraid to set the depth pretty deep, it leaves a beautiful edge that way and doesn't score your concrete.3) Lower the front wheel to the depth you desire. (in addition to setting your blade depth in step 2).4) Most important is to keep the wheels on flat concrete or you risk chipping your concrete curbs/driveway corners and sidewalk corners.If you run the wheels on the grass, you will certainly chip a sidewalk or driveway. If you see sparks flying, you are not using this tool correctly and you are busting up concrete that shouldn't be scored.If you bear those four tips in mind, you will have a great end result in a short time with this tool. It's powerful and durable and cost effective.This tool is exceptional in my view. It gives you a good sense of accomplishment when done, because it produces a fine edge. I have even used it around curved gardening edges without problems.Five star product that I think is under priced.***2009 Update*** I am still using the same unit with the same results. In fact, I still have NOT had to change the original blade!! By far this is my best piece of equipment for lawn care.

This commentary on Romans is one of my favorite ones. (I have hundreds of commentaries-and am a preaching pastor who works exegetically from the Greek text).Edwards gives a lot of great ideas on how to present the concepts. So for preaching, he's a goldmine (as Stott is also-but I like Edwards commentary more that Stott's). I don't always agree with his views on a passage, but always feel he's careful and that he does a great job presenting the view he has. This book is shorter than some of my commentaries, and does not handle all the issues on every paragraph that may emerge, but Edwards emphasis is refreshing and extraordinarily helpful for a serious student or a pastor working on a sermon from a Romans passage. This commentary is one that I will probably always refer to when writing a sermon from Romans. It is in my top three Romans commentaries and I would recommend it highly to everyone. (see also Moo, Kasemann & Stuhlmacher)

Although this commentary is not very long, there are still pages and pages of information on each chapter of these two Pauline epistles. Boice is logical and easy to follow. This commentary is useful for people who are teaching classes, bible study leaders and preachers.For deeper more thorough commentaries on Galatians I recommend Fung (NICNT). On Ephesians I recommend Bruce (NICNT).

This book helped me gain confidence in changing my lifestyle for better health. I found that an equal balance of working out all three areas of the body as he lays it out in the book didn't work well for me. Essentially my legs are ok....but have a big gut. I injured my knee trying to do a lot of leg work outs and had to stop. Also I found the free dumb bells led to elbow injuries for me as well. So I think that for some guys...machines that help better to regulate one's form...and a customized workout that focuses on the areas of you body that you need to work out most...are what the trainers recommended in our gym. That made a lot of sense to me.I think the rest of his stuff helped us gain enough confidence to try...and for that the book is worth more than the retail price. I recommend you get it!

This product is essentially a 166 page paperback manual on learning spoken Chinese. Contrary to the reviews, it now includes a cd that has pronunciations (one male and one female) for each lesson's material. However, I have to say that perhaps I'm spoiled by Yangyang's DVD guide,Learn Chinese with Yangyang - Pinyin Lessonsbecause her voice is so endearing and enjoyable. In contrast, the vocal tambre of these recordings is unpleasant. Out of the millions of people in Beijing could they not find two people with pleasant sounding voices? I assume they did not think about that aspect of it.I am excited about this book because it focuses on the top 1,000 most used Chinese words. As someone living in Taiwan now, the only element it lacks is the traditional characters. I do wish they included traditional characters underneath every word, but that's not a big deal. The quality of the voices speaking is a bigger deal in my mind. So without that I give this a four star. Otherwise it's my favorite grammar on learning Chinese that I've found so far...as far as any sort of systematic approach. It's not really a Chinese Grammar, more of a spoken Chinese tool with Grammar points to clarify for each lesson.This product has 40 lessons in it with an average of about 25 words per lesson. If you want to, you can jump around after you get going. So if you are going to a restaurant you can jump to lesson 16 and do that lesson. Not everything makes sense that way, but it is helpful. Let me zoom in on lesson 16 to illustrate what a lesson has in it.The lesson has pencil sketches of some food items with labels on them. Then you have a conversation with key words identified that you may not know. These words are your vocabulary for the lesson. They are identified as they occur in the lesson conversation. The new words occur in a side bar to the right of the conversation. they have the type of word (noun or verb) as well as the pinyin and translation into English). If you don't know anything, you probably need to do the first 15 lessons at least once or twice. But this method forces you to apply what you already know and then grasp new words in context of using what you already know. It's a very good method. The next page gives you substitution drills for certain words. There are six subsitution drills (no translations are provided except for the new words). After that you are given a few grammatical points with some English explanation. The fourth page of the lesson gives you some pretty poor quality black and white photos of the topic at hand. These are labeled in English, Pinyin and Chinese.Overall this product is a good method, will help you a lot. But it has poor graphics in the book and poor audio quality on the cd. Even so, it's a very helpful tool and is priced right from my view.I also love [...] for conversational audio.Intensive Spoken Chinese has a broad assortment of substitution drills, standard in every lesson, which is a great way to make you think about what you are saying. This is a great resource. Highly recommended. If the audio and graphics were better this would be a five star product.

Overall, this commentary is one of my favorites. (I'm a pastor who does exegetical sermons from the Greek text).He interacts with many scholars on a variety of details without getting bogged down. It's easy to read yet gives substantive arguments that summarize well the opposing views as well as explaining his own view.One issue I would take exception to is his exegesis in Ephesians 2:1 where he labels the phrase 'trespasses and sins' as a hendiadys. The term is probably simply a synonym use-not a hendiadys. I checked with a number of Greek experts who all concur that he is probably off on that point...not a biggie...but I did remember it for some reason.One issue I really liked was his handling of Ephesians 5:18 ff. Some miss the linkage of the participles which follow 5:18...but O'Brien nails it. His explanations of the Household Table and it's header/title in 5:21 are more convincing than most I've read. I think coupled with FF Bruce on Ephesians and Stott for preaching/teaching phraseology this commentary ranks right up there as a top notch..ya gotta have it...commentary for the 'prince of epistles'. I highly recommend it and still use this book.The binding on my copy was pretty cheap. The book started falling apart the first time I opened it...and I am seeking another copy. Hope that was just a fluke.If you are a pastor or bible teacher who works through Ephesians I think you will find yourself referring to this book over and over. Buy it if you have the funds...you won't be sorry if you are a serious student of Ephesians.

I pastor a Vineyard Church in Central Illinois, and am working through Hebrews right now with our congregation. I have a number of commentaries that I have grown to love on Hebrews, but this one by Kent Hughes has risen to the top of my list of late.The principal reasons for this are:1) Ease of reading. This commentary is pleasant to read, and intelligently put together.2) Clear and insightful exegetically based comments on not only the text, but the O.T. quotations that Hebrews commonly cites are commented on with thoughtful depth. Very helpful.3) Application ideas are sprinkled throughout the text regularly, which is a great source of illustrations for a preaching pastor/teacher of the bible.4) It is clear that Dr. Hughes has dealt thoughtfully with the original text without communicating over the heads of a typical Christian leader/reader in our culture.5) He also integrates in densely written and clearly written paragraphs sweeping summaries of the historical backdrop that is relevant to the key points of a passage. For example in Hebrews 4:14-16 he points out that the Stoics, Epicureans and Jews all would have been stunned by Jesus' claim to compassionately represent God the Father in a suffering way. He explains with simple, nutshell style terminology why this is so. Very helpful stuff....and demonstrates a command not only of the Greek text, but also of the historical and cross cultural contexts of the N.T. era.I don't always agree with his conclusions, but it would be unwise in my opinion to ignore Hughes on Hebrews. I was able to get very nice copies used through Amazon and am very pleased with vol. 1 and 2 of the Hebrews series.

I am a pastor who uses commentaries in my sermon prep. I've found that Bock's stuff on Luke, and this volume in particular, as well as it's twin, encourage me with practical and technical information that is actually useful. For example, in the passage I just did for Palm Sunday, Bock does a great job of providing many worthwhile nuggets on Luke 19:28-40. I found some commentators wasting lots of space on issues like 'which part of the story was really spoken by Jesus' and things like that which are completely worthless for preaching...Bock avoids all that stuff and goes to the meat of the issues at hand. For example, on the cross references he sometimes provides great insights as in when discussing Bethphage, one of the little towns Jesus was near when he sent his disciples to get the colt for him to ride on...that Bock points out the Aramaic meaning of Bethphage, which was 'House of unripe figs'. The cross reference in the Greek text to the pronouncement of judgment on the fig tree earlier in Luke was augmented by this information. The clear allusion then is to the judgment pronounced on the Jews for being an unripe fig tree by Jesus as he passes through 'the house of unripe figs' just before his Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem which ends up with his grief over Jerusalem's judgment for rejecting his kingship.Bock has a lot of detail like this that I have not found as much of in most commentaries.He also cued me in on the angaria concept without too much information so that I could see crucial points without wasting a lot of time on minutia. (Angaria was the custom of demanding citizens provide transportation...which may relate to the provision of the colt for Jesus triumphal entry).This commentary is a wealth of very helpful information that is based on solid exegesis. His information provided also blends well with the sermon crafting process for those who are careful to use tried and true hermeneutical principles.I have found that these two Luke commentaries (Baker Exegetical) are more helpful to me than even my NICNT on Luke...and I love that one as well.A whole hearted recommendation here.2009 update: This commentary still remains my top pick for Luke studies.

For example, in the passage I just did for Palm Sunday, Bock does a great job of providing many worthwhile nuggets on Luke 19:28-40-the twin volume to this one using the exact same format and approach. I found some commentators wasting lots of space on issues like 'which part of the story was really spoken by Jesus' and things like that which are completely worthless for preaching....Marshall (NIGTC), who so many rave about, gives far less practical help and spends time evaluating and defending what parts of the story are 'real' and what parts are added later...AND yet his overall coverage is about 25% of Bock's in total...so this means you get about 15% of the real meat that Bock gives you on any one passage. Bock gives much more than the NICNT also.Bock avoids all that stuff and goes to the meat of the issues at hand.

I have been using this for a group as we do a mini-series through Luke.I've taken five different paragraphs in Luke, representative of the five sections of Luke, and looked at this resource along with a number of others.1) Pre Ministry of Jesus2) Galilean Ministry of Jesus3) On the Road to Jerusalem Ministry of Jesus4) Conflict and death in Jerusalem5) Resurrection and AscensionI've been exegeting the passages in the Greek text and checking some of the best scholarly resources on Luke. I use this LifeGuide to develop application questions and feeder ideas for a small group and for the application part of my sermon.There are 24 chapters in Luke, and 26 lessons in this book. Yet, I have found that even though the points made in this guide are excellent points, often crucial other points in a paragraph are left out.So I recommend this LifeGuide as a supplement to your study, NOT as the main tool.I think this is what the author had in mind, but I'm not sure.Essentially, when comments are made, this lifeguide is very good. The answers are not always given, so if you are not sure what the right answer would be to a question, you may search for other resources. For commentaries, I recommend C. Evans on Luke (NIBC by IVPress) as an easy yet accurate commentary dealing with Luke's gospel. For deeper reading, you might want to check out the well-known D. Bock's Baker Exegetical Commentary on Luke (in two volumes).So I will give this study guide a four star. I recommend you purchase a copy and use it as part of the mix in your Luke bible studies.

First I would like to mention that although Amazon lists the author as Livingstone, and another reviewer says it is Beale, the authors of this commentary are Bruce B. Barton, Linda Taylor, Dave Veerman, Neil Wilson. Grant Osborne is the General Editor and Philip Comfort is the Series Editor.This commentary falls into the category I call shorter commentaries. It is for anyone who has trouble making good sense of the fuller commentaries that are available, or if someone needs a very quick take on a particular text in 1 & 2 Thessalonians. The back cover of the commentary says "Throughout, you will find: maps, charts and diagrams, classic quotes from noted Christian thinkers, illustrations, extensive application notes." Although these things are claimed, I would not describe this commentary with this list of features.Let me explain just a little and then I will give the rest of my review. Perhaps some commentaries in the series have charts and diagrams. The 1 & 2 Thessalonians commentary has a couple of gray maps with black lettering across the gray. Instant trouble for anyone who doesn't have the sharpest vision. The two maps in this commentary show timeline for the publishing of New Testament books (many of the listings go across the page divider and are really hard to read), and the other map shows the location of Thessalonica. It describes Paul's missionary journeys, but doesn't show them on the map. Honestly any study bible available today would have higher quality maps than this commentary offers.The charts and diagrams are not found in this commentary either. They must have envisioned it for all the commentaries in the series, but failed to require the contributing authors to make some for this book? I don't know, particularly with the eschatological focus of this commentary, a few charts showing the difference between Greek views of the after life and the Christian view might have been very interesting. On page 69 & 70 a review of three major views of the rapture should include (in my opinion) a chart showing how these views visually look.Although the cover does not tell us lists are offered, there are a few lists. In addition, I found one excursion: A theology of trials and suffering in the N.T. This two page theological review of the doctrine of suffering in the N.T. is not listed in the table of contents, but can be found on pages 112/113. Our friends at Tyndale reduced the font for this article and it is not pleasant to read because of that. The layout of the rest of the book is ok, but not great in my opinion.Classic quotes from noted Christian thinkers: This is a great idea. BUT, the quotes I read often were not connected to the verses on the page. Sometimes they were, and sometimes they were not. It would be great if the authors had included the quotations in their writings AND then the editors had the stand apart quotes by them. All they have done is put the stand apart quotes on various pages throughout the commentary. Some fit and some don't. So I was left wondering why Tertullian's quote on pg 61 "Behold how these Christians love one another" was on a page commenting on these three verses:ESV 1 Thessalonians 4:6 that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. 7 For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. 8 Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.I mean, did the authors/editors mean that as a sarcastic quote?!?This is not isolated. I found a quote by John Wesley, a great quote, on a page that had nothing to do with the quote. Then sometimes the quotes fit perfectly. I had the feeling that the series editor said 'You have to use so many quotes from famous Christians in the past' and so some people added some in to reach a quota. It really gave me the feeling that someone did not pull this whole book together well. It's one of the reasons why I marked the overall rating down a star.Application is the great part of this commentary. Unlike most commentaries, which usually give a lot of detail about grammar, interpretive issues based on how to read the text, original language definitions (sometimes using the original language fonts), this commentary is by design focused on applications. It tries to answer the 'so what do I do in my life today as a result of this verse' question. This is tricky. If your application is too narrow, you restrict the meaning of the text and may cause some people to miss valid applications. In this score, and I believe it is the most important area for this book, (because after all it is the Life Application Bible Commentary) this commentary gives so many applications that a preacher has a veritable gold mine lying at his feet. Every verse has something. Then there are related and clearly thought through 'stand aparts' (I don't know what they are supposed to be called-but they are marked by the symbol of a little tree in a box). These 'stand aparts' give great application to the text. What I love about this, and the reason I recommend this commentary, is because these skip all the technical mumbo jumbo that I actually love in most commentaries, and they give you the key thing you need to respond to in your life today! These are systematically tied to the text, but often are principles. So they can be applied in almost any area of your life, and flow directly from the verse you are studying. This is important because it subtly trains the user of this commentary on valid hermeneutics. In todays world of 'have it your way' doctrines and use of the scripture, this is so important.Let me illustrate:ESV 1 Thessalonians 2:19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? 20 For you are our glory and joy.They use the NIV, but I prefer ESV.From pg 46"with overflowing love for this young church, Paul asked a question and then answered it himself. What was the hope, joy or crown in which Paul and Silas would be able to glory in the presence of the Lord Jesus when he comes? It would be the Thessalonian believers! The word hope describes Paul's confidence in these believers. The word joy pictures his own inner feelings when he will see them presented to the Lord and welcomed into the kingdom. The crown pictures a 'Victor's wreath'- the believers were like a victor's crown, giving Paul joy in having run the race for their sakes. (1 corinthians 9:25, Philippians 4;1). One day we will stand together before the Lord Jesus at his second coming. Paul imagined how he would rejoice with the believers who had come to faith through his preaching. The words "glory and joy" could refer to both outward and inward feelings. In these words, Paul left no question about hwo he felt toward these new believers. His love for them welled over into praise to God and joy in partnership with God for bringing them the message of eternal life.Ultimate RewardsThe ultimate reward for Paul's ministry was not money, prestige, or fame, but new believers whose lives had been changed by God through the preaching of the gospel. This was why he longed to see them. No matter what ministry God has given to you, your highest reward and greatest joy should be those who come to believe in Christ and are growing in Him.That is all there is for those two verses. This is typical of the entire commentary. When you compare that to a fuller commentary, say G.K. Beale in the IVP NT Commentary Series, Beale gives four pages of material on these two verses, you can see quite a difference. Beale deals with practical and complex theological issues that are raised by these verses. The Life Application Commentary could have gone down that road, but for whatever reason chose not to. The implication that Christ's judgment of all is implied in the reward/return of Christ language is omitted in this commentary!! Another issue raised in this verse is this: How does Paul's claim that he only boasts in the cross of Christ harmonize with his claim that these believer's enduring faith will be a crown of boasting before the Lord Jesus? Beale explores that and other related issues in his commentary (it's really worth getting to accompany this one). Life Application could have dealt with the issue of boasting, but skipped it. Still the application you see here is to the point and very helpful.The bottom line, although there are some problems with this commentary, and it is small, it is still a great aid for a bible study leader or preacher who is looking for sound biblical life change as a result of the scriptures they are studying. It should not be your only tool for studying Thessalonians, but it's still very practical through and through. So for this reason alone, I highly recommend this commentary.

Well, how can I say this in a nice way? If I had seen a review on this commentary explaining it in detail, I would not have purchased it.Let me give my perspective, because I'm sure there are some buyers who might be interested in this type of commentary, but I am a pastor who is working on sermons for preaching in a local Church. I look for commentaries that avoid the endless speculations about who might have originally written what part of the text, and how it might have been modified by someone who might have existed a long time ago.This commentary never seems to leave that subject behind. The author seems endlessly enamored with textual criticism. So if you love TC, buy this commentary. If it seems irrelevant to you, don't get this one.Let me focus on the martyrdom of Eleazar in II Mac 6. At first I was really excited. I thought, "Wow-he gives a page of original translation of the martyrdom. Then he gives seven pages of notes!!" His translation is at times easy to understand, but at other times it is difficult to comprehend. One phrase was so unclear I had no idea what it meant. In contrast, my other translations of II Macc were able to help me grasp the meaning the first time through. So that wasn't good, but by the time I finished his notes on a section, I felt I discovered something that would be best for a research paper on redaction theories or something.On Eleazar's martyrdom, this author seems to have a strong grasp of Ancient Near Eastern background to the Old Testament, with speculative theories about Mardukist Martyrdom texts providing illumination to the Jewish martyrdom texts (I found that implausible). His breadth of interaction reaches in every direction, except into the N.T. It's clear to my mind that Eleazar's martyrdom is a spectacular example of what Peter has in mind when he suggests adding 'Aretes' 'Virtue' to ones faith. Since 'aretes' is the key point of the story, setting up the inspiration of the seven martyred brothers in the next chapter, it seems odd to me that the author would find ties to Marduk, but nothing in common with Peter's writings!! And also given that Maccabees is one of keys sources for the study of Jewish backgrounds of the NT, I was disappointed with Goldstein's failure to tie into New Testament material.Another thing that I found disappointing was that this commentary does not provide life transforming application of any kind, nor does it focus in an organized way on theological implications from the text.All that aside, it has value. There are grammatical comments sprinkled throughout dealing with Greek issues that may help the reader grasp nuances more clearly. He also has extensive indexes in the back and ten pencil maps of various scenarios related to Maccabees. He has appendixes with titles like:How the writers counted time. The Petition of the Samaritans and Antiochus IV's reply. Why it is unlikely that epistle 2 was composed between 67 BCE and 73 CE. (I would say between 67 BC and 73 AD)His scripture index has a few references to the NT, but not much at all.Basically, for pastors and Bible teachers who have to bring real life inspiration and transformation into peoples lives on a regular basis, you will not want to purchase this book. If you are into research and are looking for interesting theories to round out a paper for a school project, then this commentary might be your ticket.BTW-the price printed on the back of this book is $35. I really did not appreciate being charged $10 over list by Amazon. I think if anything this commentary should sell for well below list. I would value it at about $19.95

As a pastor who looks for great ideas to develop sermon points in commentaries, I have found this commentary to be the very best one I have for Isaiah. As the NIVAC series does so well, this commentary gives some exegetical information, contextual bridging from ancient to contemporary settings, and then wrestles with contemporary issues and real life needs.For example, Oswalt deals with several theological ramifications from Hezekiah's story in Isaiah 38-39. (Hezekiah's life was extended by 15 years after crying out to God in prayer). Oswalts exegetical comments are careful, insightful and lead to practical and powerful application. In this passage he points out that Hezekiah's illness was not necessarily a result of sin, and deals with the issue that sin is often a result of sin but not always. He brings in both concepts with multiple scripture references.Then he swings to the issue of God's sovereignty, man's freewill and the Open Theism debate and it's potential support from an overly simplistic interpretation of this passage. He clearly and without a lot of fluff deals accurately with that issue. He leaves no room for an over emphasis on God's sovereignty in light of the multiple references to human freewill, yet fully embraces a biblical concept of sovereignty. He also explains with a minimum of verbage (something I always appreciate by a technical scholar) why Open Theism is an over simplistic conclusion from this passage. He shows why this passage does not warrant a conclusion that has too much of an emphasis on the 'freewill of man' or an over emphasis on the Sovereignty of God. The points are pretty hard to reject if one welcomes all the data involved and comes without a blinding bias.This particular volume in the NIVAC series may be the very best one that exists. It certainly is my best one, and I have several. It is also a 'Gold Medallion Book' sporting the coveted award on the front cover. So it has been widely embraced by a variety of editors, scholars and pastor/teachers. In fact I will say this much...I stopped using this commentary series after finding several of them promoting applications that I thought were way out of touch with the people I minister to. This commentary has completely reversed that general thought in my mind.As I work through Isaiah, I find myself turning to this volume more and more. It's a great companion to the more technical and less practical 'The Prophecy of Isaiah' by Motyer, and to the NICOT 2 volume series by this same author, Oswalt.It's my recommendation that you buy this volume first unless you are only doing a more critical exegetical paper. In that case I recommend Oswalt's NICOT and Motyer's volumes instead. I went ahead and got all four books and am not sorry at all. They are all fantastic tools.I am grateful for great scholars who provide so many helpful insights to the text.

Although I don't often get excited about a NIVAC commentary, this one is really good. I'm preaching through Micah right now. I've had people tell me recently that they have never heard a sermon series through Micah. In a day when few believers hear sermon series through important Old Testament books like Micah, it's critical that we do not get bogged down in simply what the text meant to Israel 2800 years ago, but that we move on to relevant and life transforming truths for today.For details on this, let's zoom into Gary Smith's section on Micah 3. Micah 3 contains condemning prophecies about the leadership of Israel. In these 12 verses of chapter 3 Smith offers up 16 and a half pages of commentary. His commentary (as is the pattern in the NIVAC series) sports an initial section called 'Original meaning'. This is his exegetical section. Compared to other commentaries it is the same basic pattern except that this one is easy to read. A major and refreshing change is that this series avoids technical language issues...like transliterations of the Hebrew and detailed discussions about whether or not Micah wrote a phrase or verse here or there...and all the theories about source material. He even avoids the grammatical analysis that some commentaries really shine on. So for a technical commentary that a student or scholar would prefer, "this ain't it". But if you are teaching through Hosea, Micah or Amos, this is a great tool! So, after two pages of an overview of the basic meaning of this chapter, he then gives a mini view of each of the three paragraphs within this chapter.In his overview he talks about the unity of their judgment themes AND the progression of the judgment as the prophecy unfolds. He does link Hezekiah's repentance in Jeremiah 26 to Micah (which I find very plausible). In 3:1-4 we have graphic illustrations that are meant to shock the reader. The idea of 'Cannibalism' by the leaders is probably a metaphor designed to show the beast-like behavior of the leaders from God's perspective. Smith essentially says this in a memorable and preach-able fashion (his summary is far better than the other commentators I've read so far on this chapter-even though he does not get into the Hebrew text or quote Hebrew grammatical points and all of the questions about textual variations that can consume some exegetical commentaries).After this very helpful section, Smith moves on to 'Bridging Contexts' where he discusses related passages and themes. In this section there are many ideas that could really help a preacher. As he talks about justice and judicial leaders and political leaders, there are several illustrations from the Old Testament that Smith ties this particular passage to. For this paragraph he links to specific instances of David and Nehemiah that bring in illustrations that not only preach well, but also give the preacher great ways to further educate the congregation on how God's word has cohesive themes.He contends in his application section called 'Contemporary Significance' that God demands all leaders to be just. He asks (and rightly so based on Micah's message) that if the bible emphasizes justice so much, then should the church be at the forefront of calling for justice in the world? He says that the church ought to support politicians who call for independent counsels to investigate injustices...and rightly bemoans the fact that it seems to be of interest only to the more liberal wing of the church.Anyhow, in his section on 'Contemporary significance' Smith reverts to more illustrations from other parts of the bible. The application section has six pages for these twelve verses, and his thought is cohesive and very helpful. I would like to see more application ideas that are contemporary in this section, rather than a host of links to other parts of the bible. Scholars seem to have a hard time connecting their studies to 'regular folks', but this one does a good enough job that I think preachers and bible teachers will benefit a lot from it. So-I give it a five star. Thank you Gary!

This is a true story of what happened to a multi-generation missionary family from the Joplin, Missouri area when they were forced to flee their home and enter into the jungles of Southeast Asia for six years. All kinds of stories, some difficult to believe, abound in this book which was commissioned by Readers Digest. Gene Morse told me that he had to tone down some of the gospel aspects he wanted to put in because the project was a collaboration with Readers Digest. Even so, there is an account of a Yeti sighting, some sort of exceptionally long snake (perhaps a huge boa of some sort) and many stories about authentic jungle life.For example, he has a story about how an old sound system rescued them from an Elephant stampede.I've been out to eat with some of the Morse family members. They are honest, good old fashioned Americans who love God and are serving faithfully as missionaries. I heartily recommend you buy this book. It's an amazing read.

This movie makes everyone in our family laugh all the way through it every time we see it. The aliens are hilarious...the plot is so funny...a big part of it is the cheese factor which is intentional. We just love this movie.The plot plays off a typical Star Trek episode...portraying the actors as they 'really are'...and an alien civilization which picks up the broadcasts and thinks they are 'historical documents'. This starts the action...and it really gets funnier and funnier as it goes along. Tim Allen is perfect for the lead role...and S. Weaver is great side kick...so many great one liners in this movie...my wife and I think it's one of the best comedies we own.I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this one.

This was a gift to me by a member in my congregation.First let me say that the CD packaging is solid. Leather case, with easy access sleeves that are durable.Second, the version that is read here is the finest available in English in my opinion. I came to this conclusion after carefully comparing it to the Greek New Testament for about a year, my own translation work from sermons last year, and about 7 other English translations (including the NIV, NLT, NAS, NKJV, KJV. The ESV maintains a tight mirror image to the original text, yet it sounds like a pleasant English. For more on this, you may wish to read my review on the ESV Outreach Bible here on Amazon.If you have access to them, ask any Greek scholar about the ESV and I think you will find they give it extremely high marks. So I prefer this audio bible mainly because it is the ESV. On to less important details...The CD labels and finishing quality are fine. No problems.A few CD's had data read problems with feeding the track labels to Windows Media Player. One cd I was able to get it to load onto itunes, and then it worked on Windows Media Player after I loaded it onto itunes. On another cd that didn't work, so I had to type in the track titles manually.Otherwise, the product is flawless. A light touch of music in the background is not irritating and is soothing/meditative. The Max McLean speaks at a 'walking pace' throughout, which I find very pleasant.I saved this onto my Windows media player, and then whatever passage I am preaching on that week I simply load onto my MP3 device so I have the scripture right there. I highly recommend this product.Other ways this product can be used include listening while working out (I find the music background helps a bit). Also, it is good for a family devotional primer or even for use in a congregational setting. I often use it in a leaders meeting or in a small group meeting.

I always thought of Lightfoot as the scholar who gave us the Apostolic Fathers, including the Didache and Shepherd of Hermes Greek Texts and English translations. Then I discovered his commentary on Galatians. I have the tenth printing from 1890 London. The fonts are readable and clear. The book contains over 350 pages of scholarship on the six chapters of Galatians. It's a thorough commentary. Coupled with Luther on Galatians, we have a good glimpse into the history of commentaries on Galatians. References to Papias, Tertullian, Victorinus and many other Early Church Fathers are scattered throughout this commentary. He not only grasped the history and the Greek text, but he knows how to bring the Early Church Fathers perspective to bear when pertinent.I am so happy I found a copy. I urge you to pick up a copy if you can find one.

As I preach through some of the prophets of the Old Testament, I find that Elizabeth Achtemeier's material, whether in this book or her other resources, is very helpful. In this particular book she gives inspiring nuggets without wasting our time on textual critical issues or theories about sources and redaction. She even tosses in good application illustrations that I've found assist in preaching. Over and over I find myself evaluating my resources on whatever minor prophet I am preaching through, and I've learned to turn to Achtemeier's material first because she always seems to wind up being my most helpful resource.Let me illustrate: In Amos 5:1-16 we have a prophetic funeral lamentation over Israel's future coming judgment. In that passage Achtemeier points out that God is not as angry as he is sorrowful. Her string of cross references weave together to form beautiful side items in any sermon on Amos 5. For my last sermon on Amos 5 I found that almost every single cross reference she gave was not only relevant, but enabled me to put serious meat behind the most crucial point of the passage: Seek God and live! In her cross references for Amos 5 she took us to Psalm 24 and 27, fixing our attention on those elements of scripture that challenge all people to seek God.Addition: This commentary was the most helpful tool in my library for my recent sermon on Obadiah. The author was clear and focused. It was excellent because she enabled me to see a vital preachable theme when she focused my attention on the pride filled hearts of the Edomites. That led to a sermon on pride and humility using this book. My other tools obscured this point in their complex analysis and comments.If you are a bible preacher or teacher and you are working through the minor prophets, this is a resource that will practically help you more than others in developing your key exegetical idea and in applying that to people's lives. I am so glad I was able to lay hands on a copy. I recommend it highly.

This is one of those tools that many people overlook, but everyone who teaches or preaches from the OT needs. It is packed with useful information. For example, this past week I was working on a sermon from Micah 3 (where leaders in Israel are condemned for cannibalism). Some of my resources focused on the symbolic nature of this comment. BBCOT (this book) focused my attention on the 8th Century BC problem of siege warfare that purposely caused starvation as a common technique with cannibalism as a commonly prescribed curse in some cultures. This was tied to 2 Kings 6 where cannibalism is reported from that very time period.Unfortunately my other resources led me down a wrong path on Micah 3. But this tool provided a couple of key insights that not only enhanced my own understanding, but helped me to reject a wrong assumption that some of my resources were propagating.I know the author, Dr. Walton, from a class i audited by him at WCGS. He's an excellent man with a great grasp of the issues related to this book. I'm very glad we have this tool. It's too bad there are not more supporting photos, but I understand the publishers limitations on the size and number of volumes put a damper on that very issue. Still, it's a great tool and I use it regularly. Five stars!

I'm a pastor who preaches through books of the bible. I am just finishing my current series on 1 Corinthians. I've found this commentary to be one that I would not want to work without. It's really one of the best ones I own. I've found David Garland's commentary to be consistently even handed, careful to evaluate the text honestly, and helpful in almost every situation I've used this commentary for. In particular I found this commentary more helpful on his treatment of 1 Corinthians 11, 13 & 15 than most of my other tools on 1 Corinthians. I've been using about 15 different commentaries on 1 Corinthians, including Worthington, Fee, Keener, Thiselton's NIGTC & Thiselton's Short Pastoral Commentary on 1 Corinthians, as well as a bunch of other commentaries like Prior (Bible Speaks Today Series) & Life Application Commentary. All of them have individual strengths, but this commentary, Garland's, has a lot more material than most of the other commentaries (except for NICNT & NIGTC) I own. Not only does it have more material, but most of the material is helpful.This series of commentaries does one thing that I don't appreciate. The editors have decided to put summaries at the beginning of each segment of the commentary in a medium gray shaded box. This does set apart the text that is a summary of what follows, but it does not copy well on a copier. So if you like a summary and want to use that in a small group discussion you have to lug the entire book in with you. It is also difficult on the eyes to read a few pages of that black print on medium gray background. I just don't like it.Garland sometimes doesn't summarize his material as well as I would like to see. For example, the section on 1 Corinthians 13 where he introduces his exegetical comments on love has some statements that are meant to summarize what follows, but almost contradict the most important point that follows. They sounded good, but as I thought about them, I became worried that he was going to add to the published material that wrongly defines agape as 'unconditional love'. Sometimes he also spends a lot of time on things that most pastors (at least myself) don't really care about. For example in his discussion on love he gives 23 pages of material. The first 4 pages are his summary, but he never accurately defines love in his summary. He does later on in his detailed exegesis, but in his summary he says things like "Love is concern for their community" and "love is the new aeon already present". He says that love is the marrow of the Christian existence. In the 4 pages of summary material he gives two pages to the discussion of the raging and worthless debate on what kind of literary passage does 1 Corinthians 13 represent. If scholars ever figure that out, will it help us? I think that kind of stuff is pretty much a waste of ink and paper, but that's just my opinion. He obviously thought it was worth half of his summarization of 1 Corinthians 13! But he never got to the point that some have written about...and EVERY scholar publishing articles on agape needs to have the courage to write about the fact that the word agape does not mean unconditional love just because it is the word agape. He didn't say that...although he in essence comes to that conclusion without talking about the unconditional love definition pop myth.So anyhow, much to my delight when I arrived at his detailed exegesis of 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 Garland (to use a baseball metaphor) hits a grand slam home run. He goes to the fine work of Spicq (French scholar and quotes his 3 volume set's article on agape-which has the best definition on agape in print).Theological Lexicon of the New Testament 3 Volume Set(By the way, he doesn't cite Spicq's exhaustive work on Agape. But he is the published authority on detailed study of this term historically and is the most helpful scholar in print on agape.Agape in the New Testament, 3 VolumesIt made me so happy to see Garland pull through and define agape as "demonstration of love" that I wanted to shout 'yes'! He defines agape in this section as something that is not an inner feeling alone, but that it must put itself on display...quoting Spicq verbatim. So he ends up contradicting the summary section of his commentary. Agape is not 'concern for the community'. It is a demonstration of love. I especially love his links to the unmentioned backdrop of the 1 Corinthians passage (Paul doesn't say it in chapter 13), but the clear demonstration of God's love for us all in the offering of his Son on the cross. Bravo!! Pastors-these things preach well! Don't overlook this material. If we goof up the definition of love, we seriously miss what the accurate meaning is of many biblical passages. For 'agape' is a primary theme in the New Testament, if not THE primary theme.He also handles the 'perfect' term correctly, does not even bother to mention the old view that some amazingly are still teaching to this day...that the perfect refers to the completion of the canon: see the ESV Study Bible notes on 1 Corinthians as an example.The ESV Study BibleHis material should be read before one uses 1 Corinthians 13 in a wedding because it will help a good Pastor preach in a more practical way for a couple.I say all of this, because sometimes if you are short of time you will be tempted to read just his summaries of a section. I recommend you try to slot enough time to read his exegetical comments in full because of what I have just chronicled on 1 Cor 13.I wish he had a sub section for each part that gave pertinent links to ancient Jewish and Greek literature with focus on the Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Apostolic Fathers, and 1 Century Jewish authors writing in Greek (like Josephus). I think it would be helpful to have more cross links to these categories. He does bring them into play, but it seems to be more judicious that I would prefer. It would also be interesting to see some material tying into the Hebrew Old Testament terms for love and how this ties in to 1 Corinthians as well as more LXX ties.I found his treatment of 1 Corinthians 11 to be convincing, noting the difficulty of treating the 'head covering' issue, he lays out a full case for how to interpret that passage, including a simple, yet confirming chiastic outline to support his point. I think I agree with him on that as well. His handling of 1 Corinthians 15 helped me preach on the resurrection and is a worthy aid to any pastor who has to prepare a message for a funeral.Because some of these passages are usually used in Weddings and Funerals, and I have used them over and over in Weddings and Funerals, I found it interesting to see how Garland contextualizes these passages. I think his links to Paul's purpose in writing remain consistent throughout the book. So you will regularly be reminded of why Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. On 1 Corinthians 13 Garland's comments are superior to Fee's because he correctly defines agape. Fee doesn't cite either of the massive works by Spicq (how can they be ignored?)...but does quote Shakespeare?! This is why it's good to have both commentaries if you can afford it.One reviewer wrote that this commentary is superior to Fee'sThe First Epistle to the Corinthians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)because of his treatment of 1 Corinthians 14:34. I don't know if I agree with that. I believe it's a worthy addition to ones library and that one should read Fee as well as Garland. I don't think I know enough to say which one is superior. I love both of these commentaries. I will say that I also prefer Thistleton's Shorter CommentaryFirst Corinthians: A Shorter Exegetical and Pastoral Commentaryover his NIGTCThe First Epistle to the Corinthians : A Commentary on the Greek Text, and I prefer Keener's short Socio commentary1-2 Corinthians (New Cambridge Bible Commentary)over WitheringtonConflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2 Corinthiansbecause he consistently gets to the relevant issue at hand.If you have $100 budgeted for 1 Corinthians, I recommend Fee & Garland. Then Thiselton's shorter commentary and Keener's shorter commentary. Of all of these I love Garland the best. But they are all excellent. When I am done reading a section by Garland on 1 Corinthians, I usually have the sense that I've just had an objective and helpful look at what scholars say, and what the text actually means, as well as some links for further study on key issues. I think that's likely how you will feel too if you purchase and use this book in your sermon prep time.

I am becoming a fan of this commentary series. For Hosea we have over 230 pages of technical information well organized for busy pastors, scholars and bible teachers. Let me illustrate what I mean.Hosea has 14 chapters. He deals with them one at a time. For chapter 12 he starts on page 205 and finishes on 218. So there are 14 pages on this one chapter. But what I like about this commentary is not the volume of information he provides, but the way it is laid out. The material flows along the logical pathway of the exegetical process.He gives a bibliography related to chapter 12. He gives the text in the left column along with language and textual comments like...12:1 the inverted sentence order alone with Judah placed first next to the statement about Ephraim in v 1a requires an adversative interpretation. He then talks about how the various original texts handle this and how this is impacted by different variants. He works through significant language and textual variant issues to establish the correct text before he develops any other concepts.He deals with the key word (treachery) giving translations of any Hebrew or Greek text as he gives the original quotes-and they are in the original language fonts which I personally prefer). The section dealing with the language structure he calls form. So by the time he begins his interpretation section he has already given 4 pages of technical information to help establish the text and it's correct form.He gives a 'Setting' which concludes that this chapter was probably proclaimed in the Judean border near Bethel or gilgal.The next section in the commentary is Interpretation: This covers pgs 209-216 with references to many significant Hebrew terms throughout.Here he deals with the plain in situ meaning of the text. He works through what Hosea is saying in this chapter, bit by bit.After several crucial pages of information on the meaning of the text in his Interpretation section.Then he opens up his final section 'Aim'.In this he explores ideas that Hosea is retelling the Jacob story in some way, but he makes no application to comtemporary life. For a pastor who is developing a sermon on Hosea, this commentary will provide no bridge material to connect with people today. He doesn't draw any links to the NT community of believers. So the entire exercise has a very technical, academic feel to it.Therefore, I do not recommend this commentary for those who are untrained in how to develop applications from the text. Those looking for inspiration in a commentary will not find the spiritual fire that some commentators provide. But for raw technical information on the text of Hosea, this one is a gold mine.I recommend this as a textual guide for anyone doing raw exegetical work, during the phases where you are examining the text, it's correct form and clear meaning in the original tongue. Beyond that, it doesn't help. (I used the 1974 edition). I don't think the series was aiming to provide application material, so that is not necessary a negative point, just a fact of this series.So for what it offers up, I give this commentary a five star.

As I've been digging deeper into the New Testament, I've been gathering more resources on books like First and Second Maccabees (for NT Jewish Backgrounds study). As I look at my current resources on Maccabees, I believe this one is by far the shortest work I have. At 134 pages, with a stapled spine, it looks and feels like a thick study guide, but it is actually a commentary. And if you look at the layout of the book, slightly over half of the material is the text of 1st and 2nd Maccabees. It's written like a study bible, yet without the cross reference margins. It has one black and white map in the back of Palestine during the time of the Maccabees. It has a few (three or four) study aids or topics to discuss for each chapter in the back. There is no index of any kind and there are no footnotes. The introduction is a few pages long. All the pages are 5.5 x 8, so you are really talking about maybe 50 to 60 pages of commentary in this book. The text is the New American Bible 1970, and the type setting is large and pleasant to look at. It's inexpensive, and rightly so, you don't get a lot beyond a simple translation here, still it's nicely done for what it is. Because of these things, I think it was worth getting. The commentary is straightforward and written for a small group bible study or Sunday School class setting (in my view).This translation of Maccabees is excellent to read. I've enjoyed it a lot.let me illustrate what he talks about here. For 2 Maccabees 6:12-17 we have the following comments directly below the text in large, easy to read type."A theology of persecution. The reader was advised earlier that the reason for the ills that befell Jerusalem and the people was that the people had sinned by engaging in various Hellenizing activities. The author now explains that the punishment was not meant to be destructive, but corrective, like a parent disciplining a child. In effect, the author states that God gives the other nations enough rope to hang themselves: with Israel, God punishes them before they reach the fulness of their sinfulness so that they can experience God's mercy. The assertion that God does not abandon the covenanted people is found throughout Jewish tradition."The commentary then goes on to Eleazar's martyrdom, and presents this as possibly intentionally set up as an inspiration to the seven brothers and their mother who were martyred during Antiochus IV reign of desecration and forced Hellenization. He also touches on interesting things, but does not develop them at all. For example, he mentions there are parallels between Socrates and Eleazar, but doesn't enumerate any and gives no footnotes or references for further study. (Boooo!!)2 Maccabees 6 on Eleazar contains the first mention in this book of a key term (ARETHS-or Virtue) that Peter uses in 2 Peter 1, and thus becomes potential Jewish Background study material for a deeper exegesis of 2 Peter 1 in the New Testament. However, Spilly does not pick up on this. He does not tie into NT usage of terms in Maccabees generally, and so for NT studies this book is good for familiarization with Maccabees, but NOT good for tying in terminology used later in the NT. It's amazing to me that a commentary on Maccabees would overlook that sort of information!!!Still I believe this is a well written albeit very concise study guide sort of commentary. It's a great way to just sit and read Maccabees and to glean a little clarification and explanation along the way.

This was a gift to me by a member in my congregation. Previously they had given me the NT as well. I've already started using this product daily. At the time of this review, Amazon's price was almost $14 lower than the discount Christian book sites I checked.

This is probably the classic strategy game on a pc. My son loves this game, and so do I. While it has lots of options for each nation you can play, there are not too many options like in Yuri's Revenge. Some maps are excellent. And you can create your own maps pretty easily with a free online program called Final Alert 2.It seems that RA2 crashes a lot from internal errors and that no one has published a way to solve this problem. Even so, the game is dangerously addicting because it is so fun to play. Probably the best war game we own on any system.If you have more than one pc that can go online via your ISP simultaneously, you might want a second copy so you can play with someone you know...that's even more fun.

First of all I would like to say that the mouse worked the first time without a hitch. However, there are two problems with this mouse.1) The USB cable on it is not long enough to plug into the left side of a laptop (a lot of laptops have USB ports on the left side-like my Compaq Presario). It cannot plug into the left side of the laptop and then extend around the laptop for use on the right side of the machine. For anyone who is right handed you have to put the cable directly underneath the laptop...and then there is barely enough room for the mouse to move around. So if your machine has a USB port on the left side of the machine, and you are right handed, forget this mouse. It's unbearably tight.2) It is too small for an average hand. My hands are average size. Holding the mouse creates a side to side tension in my hand because I have to 'cuddle' the mouse to hang on to it. I'm sure that after several more days of use I would have a problem with my hand/muscles.I recommend this mouse only for children or people with very small hands and who have a USB port on the front or right side of their laptop. Otherwise, forget it.I further cannot understand why Logitech would fail to mention these unusual features on the product packaging.Shame on them for misleading the buyers.

For anyone wanting to learn a little Chinese, be aware that this book is aiming at people who will go into places where Traditional Chinese is used rather than Simplified Chinese. (Basically San Francisco California, Taiwan, Indonesia and anywhere else outside of Mainland China). If you are going to Mainland China, the characters used in this book have more detail than you will need because the system was changed in the 1950's in mainland China.Ok, so for the promised aim of this book, teaching you to understand Chinese Characters by their ancestral forms, this book delivers a home run. It's easy to understand, has gone through four editions, and includes some excellent tools for growing in your knowledge of Chinese characters.In short the material is organized by two methods. First the original stylus forms for each character are used. (This book only teaches 288 characters out of many thousands possible to study). The argument (and it's a good one) is that original stylus drawings of characters communicated a clear concept. The development of a brushed character tended to obscure that original concept in favor of writing speed and convenience. This book is further organized into what some may call Semantic Domains (they don't use the term semantic domain but that's what they are doing). This idea takes all characters and organizes them around categories. So for example all characters for animals are organized into one group and laid out side by side so that the learner can see patterns and differences. This enables groups of words to be learned relatively quickly. This book has an alphabetical index as well as a semantical domain index. It also has a simple character identifier that helps figure out the core idea of a character. It's GREAT!In addition this book contains stylus characters next to brushed characters so you can see the relationship and the difference. The stylus of a moon is clearly like a moon anyone would draw. As an example though the character for moon is not so clear, in fact I would not have guessed it was moon right off. It resembles more like an ear or just a some random character. But when you line up the stylus of moon next to the brushed character of moon you immediately see it!In essence this approach blends history, visual comparisons and the semantical domain approach into one very unique product that is well worth purchasing if you are learning Chinese for any of the locations I mention above. The icing on this cake (so to speak) is that the book has about 10 pages of characters that can easily be photocopied and enlarged (I recommend card stock paper). They can then be cut up to make a set of 288 flash cards to help you learn the commonly used characters presented in this book.If you are learning spoken Mandarin and want to know even a little bit about Chinese characters, I cannot imagine a simpler and more interesting or more effective approach. If one exists, please let me know! I highly recommend this book!

One big thing to note...this package says PC/DVD on the cover, so if your pc has an older CD drive only (as ours does) you will not be able to load it on your machine. We had to put it on a different machine.Also-the websites that EA advertises are no longer functioning even though this product is still being sold on the market. Just google the company to find their latest location.The games work about half the time, but they are still great fun. It seems that Red Alert 2 & Yuri's Revenge are our favorites, only eclipsed by Generals Zero Hour, which is probably the best game I've ever played on a computer. Between computers hanging up while trying to run this game, or over heated systems crashing, or mismatches on the net, this game fails about 50% of the time I play it. To my knowledge there is no work ongoing to support this product.One tip & one warning: Download Final Alert 2 from the internet (it's free) and use it to make maps for these games. That's a lot of fun. We were able to take maps of real places in the world (bmp format) and make games using real world maps. One big warning...do not download the mod packages. They usually corrupt the game and then you have to reinstall everything!Enjoy these games. There are lots of kids online playing them and they are really fun. If you like these, you might love Generals Zero Hour. It's similar, but with more micro management for detailed play/strategy and better detailed graphics.

As an American Pastor who is not power hungry nor a control freak...as so many critics of this book claim it fosters...I have found this book deals with the issue of authority from a spiritual perspective. Nee doesn't hesitate to challenge Christians to trust in God and to demonstrate that trust in God by obeying leaders and by submitting to their God given authority. In our culture in America today, disrespect for leaders is considered a right. Nee calls it sin.I think one of the reasons this book has so much controversy around it is because we are so off culturally in the land of the free and the brave...with respect to submission to leaders and to authority. We are so independent minded as a nation that the whole concept seems like a foreign concept. It's very easy then for some to label it as some sort of oriental influence. But in reality this book applied well is crucial for life transforming pastoral leadership.Another reason this book has been criticized is because some leaders have used it while leading from their own insecurities and fear of losing people from their ministries. Some abusive tendencies have spawned just criticism of those ministries. But that is NOT Nee's problem...nor a result of the book. That is the result of leaders' allowing their old nature to cloud the spiritual principles laid out in scripture. So we should not blast 'Spiritual Authority'.Some I know who have been wounded by this sort ofabusive leadership have overreacted by rejecting the entire concept of any leadership/authority at all. Some say that thebible doesn't teach the concept of spiritual authority at all!!That's pretty bad in my view.Layered over that is the egalitarian movement which rejects authority in the sense Nee lays it out here. The combination is there are multiple pressures on the church to reject spiritual authority of any kind. I've seen some egalitarians fight hardto redefine words which include the concept of authority and obedience so that they can remove the entire concept. Butthe scriptures are clear on the subject.If we can study what the scripture says about spiritual authority and compare it to what Nee says here, I think we will be encouraged to trust in God through all kinds of situations...and we will see the Kingdom of God advance.There are very few books bold enough to tackle this issue. There are very few books which dealt with a failure to recognize authority in my life as this one did.For me the most convicting chapter was the one on delegated authority. Nee points out that God places people in authority and that we are rejecting him when we fail to respect delegated authorities. This led me to contact the Assistant Pastor of my old church and ask for his forgiveness. He so appreciated the call.Where do you have trouble submitting to authority?Why not read this book...prayerfully and with an open heart?Ask God to show you if you need to change and don't be surprised if you end up actually being placed into a place of spiritual authority after you learn the lessons God teaches you through this challenging book. I think that God used this book to help me transition into the ministry full time. It was and is a very helpful book for me personally.I think one other caution is in line. Some people are so overly submissive that they don't need to read this book. For those people I would recommend NOT reading this book but instead focus on something that encourages them to have healthy conflict resolutions. Maybe these people should find a book on conflict resolution and read that instead. But for most of us...especially American Evangelicals in general...we desperately need this bold message!

This is the type of tool you will want to pop in your car cd player and listen to from time to time. It's packed with great tips for relational intelligence building. I think it's perfect for a busy leader/manager who knows he/she needs to grow in the way they communicate with people and yearns to excell.As a Dad I have been using it to also teach my kids skills so our family environment is impacted by this tool as well.

As a preaching pastor working through the book of Exodus, I've found through use that this commentary is one of my finest tools. If I had nothing on Exodus and could get just a few books, this would be on my shortest list. This is despite the fact that I do not favor the authors reformed theological tendencies.Every time I look at my Exodus commentaries, I smile when I see this one. That's because it's a mammoth work in comparison to all my other tools (I have maybe a dozen or more commentaries on Exodus).In a nutshell, my favorite thing about this commentary is the apt titles he gives for each section. For example, when describing the birth of Moses he says "A savior is born". Ryken weaves Christological implications throughout the comments as he deals with topic after topic in the comments.Instead of tilting to detailed technical information, this commentary includes quotes from authors like C.S. Lewis to make key points. It's more devotional than most commentaries. The flow of thought has a fuller expression of individual thoughts with phrases and quotes that are more helpful for a preacher than most commentaries. It aptly fits the promise in the series title 'Preaching the Word'.I don't know the authors preferences when it comes to Charismatics and Pentecostals and Third Wave beliefs and authors, but anyone familiar with the last twenty years of publications from those parts of Christianity might call to memory Mike Bickle's well-known Passion For Jesus teachings and others who emphasize the fact that a revelation of God's personal love for us helps us to worship Him. This loomed large in my mind as I studied Exodus 4, especially the last few verses. Since Moses mentions explicitly that the revelation God deeply cares for Israel triggered worship in them, this key point has been made in conferences and several books repeatedly since about 1988. However, Ryken makes only a single sentence comment on God's compassion and moves on. Missing what some commentators key in on, he just calls the last part of Exodus 4 'Back in Egypt'. In comparison, Kaiser calls this 'reinforced by a brother'. I found Enns to be the most helpful on this section of the commentaries I used. Yet in many, many other situations I have found Ryken to be my favorite. His overall work is exceptionally helpful. You will find useful quotes, key points made that bring out aspects some of the other commentaries do not have time to delve into. Kaiser's work is 220 pages on Exodus, Motyer is just over 300 pages, Oswalt's Cornerstone Commentary has a few hundred pages...and MackIntosh's 19th century Notes on the Book of Exodus has 370+ half size pages. All of these combined are less than Ryken's 1240+ page commentary. It's really amazing what he has done here. In addition to the normal indexes in the back, this commentary offers seven pages of sermon illustrations index!From a careful examination of this commentaries cross references to the NT, one can see there are few references to Revelation. However, when one studies Revelation (see Beale or Mounce), a wealth of references to Exodus are found. So, when you are preaching through Exodus, it might be helpful to use a scripture index in a Revelation commentary (I recommendThe Book of Revelation: A Commentary on the Greek Text (New International Greek Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids, Mich.).)Although Abraham's covenant with God is cited as a key reason in Exodus that caused God to rescue Israel, and though Romans discusses this extensively in Romans 4, and Romans is used a lot in this commentary, there are no references to Paul's discussion of Abraham's covenant with God in Romans 4. Since this is tied to the purpose of the book, I found that to be odd. It just shows that there is so much one can find in the rich book of Exodus, that even a 1200+ page commentary cannot cover it all!The paper in this volume is ivory and the fonts are easy to read. All pleasant on my eyes...and the books construction is of a good quality.[...]I also highly recommendNotes on Exodus,Exodus,The Expositor's Bible Commentary: Genesis-Leviticus (Expositor's Bible Commentary)Genesis, Exodus (Cornerstone Biblical Commentary)

As a pastor working through Matthew's gospel, and as one who often refers to the Didache for study and insight, I found this book particularly refreshing. Although I do not agree with everything he says, the core work in this volume is excellent and very handy for anyone who is doing exegesis in either Matthew or the Didache.The author believes the Didache may be written around 150 A.D. Newer scholarship has proposed that this document was written between 50 and 70 A.D. I think that the newer scholarship is more convincing than Massaux's view here. However, that only adjusts the potential direction of the influence of these two documents. All the other work he lays out, demonstrating contact between Matthew and Didache remains valid. The question now becomes, which document influenced the other. If the Didache is truly older than Matthew, then some ideas would need to be reversed.The opening segment on the Didache is what I will focus on for this review, although he deals with other links in the first two centuries as well.Massaux shows Matthew 28:18-20 demonstrates contact with Didache's opening statement by using the terms 'Didaskovtes' (Didaxn) and Ethvesiv (Ethvn). He also points out that many believe the Didache is to be used at a baptism and that the first six chapters are to be spoken over a baptismal subject during the baptismal ceremony...and that this then links directly with 'baptizing them in the name of the Father...in Matt 28:18-20. His premise is very interesting and the evidence is clear that Matthew and Didache are closely linked. Which came first is another question to be studied...and may be a debate among scholars...I'm not really sure.In this volume Massaux lays out the Greek text along with English text showing links between Didache passages and the Sermon on the Mount. He also shows other parallels when they occur in the NT and in almost every case (there are two or three exceptions) the Matthew citation is much closer to the Didache than Luke or Mark's citation is to the Didache.He shows parallels with Matthew's SOTM (Sermon on the Mount) and discusses them in depth with the following references in the Didache:1:2a, 1:2b, 1:3, 1:4 & 5a, 1:5, 3:7, 6:2, 8:1-2, 9:5, 14:2, 15:4.He then goes on to discuss 17 other links between Didache and passages outside of the SOTM in Matthew.He gives synoptic style charts for some of the longer parallels-which is wonderful. He works through the nitty gritty of why the Matthew links are closer in text to the Didache than the Luke or Mark links are...and when they are not, he gives that as well. This book is a goldmine for demonstrating primary source relationship between Matthew's gospel and the Didache.I love this book and highly recommend you consult it.

Using this set of CD audio recordings of the NT in koine Greek, Zhodiates uses modern Greek pronunciations. I did a comparison in some passages of the GNT with the NA27th edition of the ancient Greek and the Modern Greek NT. It seems that about 70% of the words are spelled identically. So if you learn using the modern Greek pronunciation as he gives it in these recordings, then you are learning how to pronounce some words in modern Greek. For a Christian who would like to go to Greece someday or who relates to Greeks in restaurants or in other settings, this is an invaluable benefit. For that reason alone, it is worth getting this tool.I found that with my GNT open and this CD on, it is easy to mimic. It can be difficult to find your place on the cd, unless your player allows you to move to specific points in the cd.I found a blank CD in the middle of my Romans chapters, well after I had purchased this package. The manufacturer handled me swiftly and without a hassle. I was VERY impressed with how they stand behind their product.I have absolutely loved this product.If you have the funds to spend on this I would highly recommend it.

There is a growing consensus for change in the field of biblical Greek vocabulary pronunciation. No one mentions that this product uses the Erasmian pronunciation. That method is not what biblical Greek era speakers spoke (no one knows what that sounds like)...and it sounds really funny to modern Greek speakers (I have seen eminent American scholars speak with this method in the hearing of modern Greeks who cringe when they hear it).Of course this is not a problem if you only talk to English speaking bible students who talk about Greek with this pronunciation method. BUT-if you want to travel to Greece, or if you know any Greeks who speak modern Greek, you may find it interesting to know that the vocabulary of the Biblical Greek NT has about a 70% overlap with the vocabulary of Modern Greek version of the NT. (Based on my quick highlighting of the differences between the two version in my BW 7.0 recently).Because there is a difference of opinion out there on which method is best to use, software products like BibleWorks 7.0 offer both the Erasmian AND the Modern Greek pronunciation.In addition, a Greek scholar, named Spiros Zhodiates, has produced a NT recording using modern Greek pronunciation (done slowly) so that you can listen to a chapter of that with your Greek NT open and learn how modern Greeks read the Biblical Greek. With his product I like to hold my Greek NT in front of me and follow along as he reads it out loud.I think some Greek teachers are completely unaware of these things and only consider the Erasmian method. But if you are an evangelical who is studying the bible in Greek because you want to spread the gospel to the world...then I appeal to you to consider building some pronunciation skill in Modern Greek while you are studying the Biblical Greek text.So for the money, I would recommend you buy Spiros Zhodiates Greek NT recording on CD using the Modern Greek rather than this product.If you never plan to interact with Greek speaking people...THEN Pennington's work is a five star work worthy of spending your time and money on. So because of that I give this a five star.I hope this has added something to the well written reviews on this product that was not in the mix for you and that this has helped you see more options before you spend your money!

My son and I have played Red Alert & Red Alert 2 together for a long time. We bought this product and the difference is amazing. The graphics and missions are much more like todays warfare around the world. For example, you can upgrade a regular soldier (USA ranger) to be able to capture buildings...you don't need an engineer. You can upgrade your tanks to have drones ...so every tank or Humvee can have upgrades....so a cluster of vehicles has all these cool things flying overhead helping win battles. You can call in airstrikes and lots of other cool things that make the game much more realistic.On support...EA still misses....for example in the book it says if you register they will give you a free cheat code or tip for doing that. The only thing they gave us was a note saying we could now play the game online. On top of that the click through menu on the software for Generals main website is no longer there..and there is no redirection (if you can believe that!!). there's no easy way to ask questions and these problems are not addressed on their FAQ's page.We haven't figured out how to do everything on this game yet, and the lack of tutorials or tips is frustrating for my son (7 yrs old). Yet the missions are more like Iraq/Afghanistan warfare in the news over the last few years than it is like Viet Nam or WWII.We have had these same problems with almost every EA game we own. But still this game is an incredible improvement over the other Command and Conquer games.

These games are a blast and can be very addicting (until you try Generals Zero:Hour).The big issue with these games is that EA does not actively support the games. It's impossible to get a response from them (from our experience). Also-if you install several similar games together on one machine you may have trouble running the games. We have.As far as the action goes, these games bring RTS to a new level from their predecessors...like Red Alert. They are XP compatible...don't know what that one reviewer was talking about. The problem is they are getting old and have been out for about 6 years now.But for $20, you cannot miss with this pack. We bought two of them for different machines. If you like these games, you will love Generals/Zero Hour. Try that too.

I've been in the pulpit full time for 11 years now, and as I looked for resources that help with Hosea, Joel and Amos, I ran across Achtemeier's name. This book intrigued me and I'm very glad that I ordered a copy to review.I have to say that the style of writing is excellent for pastors who are writing sermons. The book definitely delivers great material that fits the title.She deals with 31 passages that span most of the OT.Looking at Hosea 1:2-9 she titles it "Marry a harlot". The first page or so gives a quick overview of the context and relevant setting of the background of Hosea. Nestled within this context are simple and sweeping rebuttals of some of the counterpoint views from groups of commentaries (she does not name the commentators she interacts with). For example she says that 'attempts have been made to soften the words of Hosea 1:2-9' and goes on to explain why that proposal is unacceptable, but gives no links to help the reader find the relevant sources for her comments. This is nice in that one can just read straight through without all the 'clutter' that most commentaries have. Her stuff is very readable and enjoyable. It's not good if you want to check out the sources to see if she has assessed them accurately...and if you are not a buff on Hosea, which the intended audience definately isn't, then how can you check out anything she says? It reminds me a little of the Bible Speaks Today series and how they handle issues like this (if you are familiar with that series).After the section on Hosea 1 called 'Plumbing the Text' where she goes through a nutshell summary of the exegetical idea, she then goes on to another section called 'Forming the Sermon' where she basically preaches. Her application is Christ-centric with a clear grasp of practical life problems in contemporary American culture as well as a direct linkage to the gospel message of the cross. Honestly, I think the 'Forming the Sermon' section is a gold mine for a pastor develop a sermon on this passage.I guess I would call this little book's section on Hosea, and by extrapolation the rest of the 31 passages she deals with, an exceptionally succinct and helpful tool for pastors who are preaching through the OT.I urge you to pick up a copy.

Honestly I have been surprised at the lack of great commentaries on the book of Acts. Maybe I've looked in the wrong places, but it seems that most of the works I've read so far are average to below average compared to the commentaries I have on other books of the bible (say Romans or 1 Corinthians). Even my commentaries on Luke, the first book in this 2 volume set, (Luke-Acts) far outstrip my Acts commentaries.I said all of that to show that when I came to Marshall's stuff on Acts, I was pleasantly surprised that he offered lots of useful insights on every verse. His commentary is one that I will pick up over and over again.For example, on Acts 1:8 he gives a quick review of the position that many hold regarding the term 'end of the earth' to mean something like all roads lead to Rome. This interpretation of Acts 1:8 then enables 1:8 to be a thesis within a story...a stroke of brilliance if that is what Luke is doing. But Marshall rejects this popular view because of the influence of Luke 24 (Acts 1 recapitulates part of Luke 24). So the overlap of the end of volume 1 is correctly seen to influence the exegesis of the opening of Volume 2. Simply put, 'end of the earth' cannot mean Rome in Acts 1:8 because of Luke 24:46ff..that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, 47 and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 48 You are witnesses of these things.So Marshall basically says in so many words that the Rome theory does fit with the general outline of Acts, but because it doesn't fit with Luke 24's focus on all nations he cannot agree with that view.He's really pretty good.Witherington has a massive work on Acts that is worth reading, but for preaching and exegetical notes I have found Marshall's shorter volume on Acts to be more helpful.When Bock's work comes out through Baker Exegetical Commentaries (if it is at all like his Luke work), then I suspect it will surpass everything I have in my library. But that is not for a few more months-and I will be finished with my Acts series by then. So for now, Marshall is the best thing I can recommend for Acts studies.

This review is written by me and my 8 year old son who watched this video with me. It teaches you how to focus on small steps that synergistically work together to form overall skill set improvement. It shows practical things you can do with a team AND things a Dad can do in the backyard with his son or daughter. We went outside and applied several things to our backyard practice immediately.My son liked the exercise that shows how to develop confidence in catching flyballs using a squishy baseball so that the fear of getting injured is removed. Skill is developed.Also the emphasis on how to develop bunting habits was really inspiring.One exercise on helping a pitcher develop balance is a great idea. we had not seen any of these in our team or other practices.My son liked the exercise when the kids tried to hit baseball caps on the ground in front of their teammate. The goal of each drill is woven into the explanations. Lots of variety.This DVD is useful for ages 7 and up.Some of the drills provide for a friendly competition between two groups of boys on a team. The drill for retrieving an outfield ball, relaying it to an infielder and throwing it home is the best one I've seen on that technique.I wish this video had more tips for pitching. They have a new video just for that purpose so I guess this doesn't cover that part of the game in depth.We borrowed this DVD from a teammate. We are going to buy a copy this winter and will try to use every drill on it.We heartily recommend it to everyone.

First let me say that I am not a craftsman by any means, but have studied and purchased tools for many years. This tool has become one of my favorite tools in a short period of time. Here are some of my reasons.1) Customer service.I had to call in because I didn't understand something on the unit and could not figure out the manual, and received a live person and the answer I needed in 1 minute!!! Unbelievable!! When I was at Menards looking for attachments to add to this unit, the sales people there didn't know squat, but I was able to get Dremel customer service on the phone after about a four minutes wait. She knew her stuff and helped me again. So they have the best customer service I have experienced with any tool company.2) Quality of the device. This tool is sturdy. It feels like a quality piece with practical and durable components. For example, the little collet nut is easy enough to loosen with your bare fingers, but it locks down tightly without a problem. This tells me that the 'crowns and roots' of the threading inside the nut and the threading on the housing of the unit is of a higher quality than some tools offer. This is a little thing, but it shows a company is detail oriented and not just cranking out parts as cheaply as possible. The housing is light and strong. A great engineering choice in my view. The adjustable pieces on this all work well. It has a metal hanging clip that works well with things like the Dremel Workstation or a hook on a peg board. Even the metal clip is a little better than some tools have. This is a good tool guys.3) Features. The features on this unit are all easy to use. The blue button to hold the collet in place while loosing the nut or tightening the nut is smooth and works with little pressure (that's a good thing if you just nailed your finger with a hammer). The thumbwheel speed control is variable. Variable speed is important for certain applications (some of them are explained in the 'Quick Start Book' that comes with the unit.Not only is the variable speed smooth and easy to use, it's positioned so that you do not tend to bump the speed up or down while using it. That's another feature I like. The feel in the hand does not require a cramped hold, and so if you are older or have any kind of hand pain, this unit probably won't intensify your pain.4) Web support. If you are a visual learner or just don't feel like reading the books (there are two with this unit). Then you can go to the Dremel site and just click on videos. These are short and well done. I really enjoyed that. All the links worked well and the website is clean and up to date, unlike some companies I have worked with recently.5) Flexibility. One thing that the Hardware store clerks I spoke to and the Dremel person I spoke to did not know, is that this unit really works in attachments that do not specify the 8000 series. I found it works in the workstation as a drill press and as a wood shaper (free hand). The reason for this is that the housing nut matches the other Dremel units. A Dremel employee told me that the reason they don't recommend this model for certain attachments is because this is a battery operated unit. I found my new battery down only about 30% after 20 minutes of cutting and sanding. This unit also works really well with a variety of other brand accessories, like Ace Hardware's accessory packs (they are pretty good with more pieces for the money than other brands). In reality this is the only cordless Dremel that lasts long enough to work in the attachments they offer. So, with this cordless you can add attachments that don't list the 8000 series on the box.By the way, Dremel staff are trained to distinguish between attachments and accessories. Accessories are the mandrels, cutting discs, grinding and sanding tips, etc.... The attachments are the workstations, router guide, etc... I found that out by accidentally calling an attachment an accessory and then customer support started talking about the tips that go on the tool. It took a few minutes for me to figure out why she wasn't answering my question exactly. I had inadvertantly switched the topic because to the uninformed (me), accessories were the same as attachments. Anyhow, just remember that accessories are the bits and tips. Attachments are the jigs and other things that can be mounted onto the tool to accomplish drill press or routing, etc....6) Battery power is superior because it is the lithium pack. These last longer and are a major improvement over the two speed cordless that so many have complained about because it does not have a long lasting battery.7) Storeage case: The case has a spot for everything. The little wrench fits into a spot in the case that keeps it visible and snug. there is a slick spot for the books to slide into in the top half of the housing, which shows about a third of the book. Dremel has the title of the book visible in that third, so if you put it back in as they send it, you can see which book you are taking...the owners manual or the quick start book. The quick start book is a color book with a lot of pictures in it.This book has become a source of a wide variety of ideas for using the tool to solve problems. Some are common problems and some are really neat. For example, the tell you what bit/piece to put into the tool and give you simple step by step instructions for how to prepare an egg shell and make it into a painted decorative present with a cut away section that enables you to put a photo in it or some decorative pieces. They give step by step pictures/instructions on how to make signs (like a street address sign). For every idea, the show the bit photo and part number needed. All the project ideas are organized into categories like: Outdoor projects, Indoor projects and Gift/Craft projects.This product is a mature product with a well thought out manual and project (quick start) book. Again I iterate that I've fallen in love with this tool. It's become one of my primary go to tools for small jobs around the house. I'll probably end up using it on my car and at work too. In my view it's a five star tool.

Using very helpful titles and phrases, Atkinson sets the pace for this series of commentaries. I've grown to look to this series of commentaries for phrases that help communicate the truths of scripture in a catchy and memorable way. For example, he uses the term Majesty and Misery to describe the Creation event and the Fall. Sometimes an overview of a section is so well written that you can read his overview from the pulpit or to a small group or classroom.As far as technical depth, this series is not designed to present technical depth, so I don't fault it for skipping over a lot of material.Here's how I use this commentary: After researching the text and looking at deeper more technical works (like Hamilton, Wenham or Waltke) I sometimes use this commentary for developing the way I will communicate the crucial points I want to make.If you are not oriented to more technical commentaries, this one will assist you. I'm glad it's in my library and am using it in my own Genesis series. I recommend it to you also.

I'm a pastor who is planning a sermon series through Song of Songs. In my research on the book I decided to purchase this commentary and have become fond of it. It's worth noting that the editor of this Baker Commentary series (Longman III) wrote his own commentary on the Song of Songs in the NICOT series. Because of this, I believe Hess had an unspoken (or maybe even spoken) understanding that he had better do a first rate job on this commentary. I believe he has done just that.When the author of the Word Commentary on Genesis (Wenham) writes a rave review on an Old Testament Commentary of any book, it is worth noting, because of his extensive knowledge of ancient near eastern culture.First we have about 285 pages on this 8 chapter book. He lays the material out in a very readable form. Hess reviews the options and declares his position without being shy about it. Sometimes he does not explain his reasons in depth, but you do find out where he stands. For example in his introduction he simply says that the Song of Songs should not be read as a drama (one major view), but that it closely resembles ancient neareast poetry, especially Egyptian love poetry. He gives an extensive 17 page bibliography on Song of Songs associated material at the end of the book. For students doing research, here you go!Hess also gives you good nuggets for further study on a variety of issues, like dating, authorship, the history of interpretation of this book, etc... On the history of interpretation he cites Pope as the most extensive known history of interpretation on Song of Songs. Things like this reveal a breadth of knowledge on the subject and also assist new students in sorting through the myriad of potential sources. He's excellent in this way throughout the book.One criticism: he often refers to a wasf in his outline and in the book. Unfortunately the definition of this term is hard to find. I stumbled across it in the middle of some text on page 31. I would prefer that they asterisk that term and send you to the definition page whenever they use it or at least in the first chunk of the book. Since many people do not read commentaries from cover to cover, that's frustrating. (By the way it is an arabic term for love poetry).After what I would consider a short introduction, he gives an outline for the book and then begins his commentary. His outline is as follows:I. TitleII. Prologue: first coming together and intimacy 1:2-2:7III. Lovers joined and separated 2:8 to 3:5IV. Love and marriage at the heart of the song 3:6 to 5:1V. Search and reunion 5:2 to 6:3VI. Desire for the female and love in he country 6:4 to 8:4VII. Epilogue: The power of love 8:5 to endHess comments with references that are easy to read, but on the technical side as far as Song of Songs commentaries go. This is no devotional commentary. It has transliterations of ancient language terminology throughout. He often cites how many times a term appears, where it first appears and how that is all relevant to the text at hand.This commentary has no excursions. There are no articles on theological implications that draw out Christological allusions or parallels. It is entirely focused on a literal rendering of the book.On the actual text Hess provides his own translation. If you are working on a specific verse in Song of Songs, it is easy to navigate Hess. The commentary relationship to the text is clearly marked. Overall this commentary is very valuable and one that I have been referring to regularly since I received it. Get a copy today.

I'm very happy to have this commentary in my library now. It is in line with the rest of the emerging series (PNTC), possessing excellent and readable comments.One pleasant surprise that I really enjoyed with this commentary is the 'Appendix' in the back. He has a compilation of all the citations dealing with Cain in ancient near east Jewish literature. This is relevant to 1 John because of John's citation about Cain in 1 John 3:12 regarding why we ought to love one another.Another excellent feature in this commentary that you do not see often in other commentaries are scores of what I call mini-excursions. These short articles are placed in context as he works through the text. So for example he has a mini-excursion on Koinonia in the midst of the notes on 1 John 1 as well as a mini-excursion on Light and a number of other crucial concepts. He's very very helpful for a pastor trying to prepare a sermon. It's becoming my favorite commentary on John's letters as I work through this part of scripure again this year.The Appendix simply lists all references to Cain, including the Genesis text in its entirety and all Jewish literary references in every known case no matter how insignificant. These references are in clear, readable English. I really enjoyed this feature and cannot recall seeing it in any other commentary before.Another feature of this commentary is the rich blend of exegesis, exposition and application. Many commentaries are so thick with exegesis and thin on application or so focused on application and thin on exegesis, that you have to use multiple sources to really achieve your goal if you are exegeting, and developing preachable points. This commentary should be at the top of any serious preachers list of Johannine resources.

This CD is a great one. The song "Let the healing begin" is so powerful and moving it can be used in anything from a fund raiser for medical patients all the way to a worship song in a church service. Brenda's musical skill shines through not only in her smooth as silk vocals, but also in her careful choice of instrumental orchestration. The quality continues on throughout the entire cd, from song to song.One time I was ministering to someone who had just lost a relative (I am a pastor), and I was able to use the song "Let the healing begin" to touch her spirit. He wept and was deeply encouraged.I'm not the only one who thinks she's a great musician/singer/songwriter. NBC has used her stuff on more than one of their TV shows. In my opinion Brenda's music is better than the typical music used on TV shows. I'm sure the script writers wish she had more cd's out than she does, because her stuff is simply wonderful.I've seen Brenda sing in front of all kinds of audiences. More than once I've seen women suddenly burst into tears while she was singing. Her music is soothing and moving.You will listen to these songs over and over through the years. I recommend At the Water's Edge as a five star cd.

We've had one of these since Thanksgiving time. It gets used all the time. So far the quality is holding. There are tons of new accessories available...our favorite one is a leather flip case to help protect it.One drawback is that it can take a lot of time to download movies and you have to find a machine that runs the right formats to download off. My laptop runs the right format but for some reason is so slow that we cannot use it for loading. Our desktops don't play dvd's so the only way we can get dvd's into this is by using a friends pc. (That's a hassle). But still we use it every day. It's a lot of fun.Video quality & sound quality are ok. What can you expect from something that fits in your palm? I think the price is a bit high, but you are getting a 30 Gig drive...and look at what XBOX 360 gets for only a 20 Gig drive! $499 So maybe it's not a bad deal.

As a pastor who studies for sermons in the Greek text, there are times when I turn to Kittel's. It usually has a lot more information for a specific word than I need for whatever it is that I'm working on. Sometimes the entries are difficult to read, other times they are absorbing and one can spend a lot of time just reading.For example, on a common word that is studied, like AGAPE, Kittel's gives quite a bit of material. A typical way to use this tool would be to augment or deepen a study on a particular word. For example, there is some dispute on Romans 8:18 as to how to translate the phrase 'EIS HMAS'. Well Kittel's has 8 pages of information on how EIS is translated in a variety of contexts...most of which does not matter for Romans 8:18. You can quickly find the comments on a passage by using the Kittel's index. Just look up Romans 8:18 in the index and it gives you all the references throughout the series where Romans 8:18 appears. Go to the volume that has the entry for your main word and there you will find all the key entries for whatever you are looking for. So in our example, one would see that Volume 2 has one entry under Romans 8:18 (Volume two has EIS as a word entry in it). So instead of having to read the entire article on EIS, you can go to just the pertinent paragraph to see what he says there.There is no other place in my library where I can find the amount of information on a simple preposition like this, or the depth of coverage. It is truly amazing. On top of that, some of the finer commentaries will comment on the article in Kittel's. In this example on Romans 8:18, Moo points to Kittel's in his 1100 page NICNT commentary on Romans.It is a 10 volume set, and this review is tied only to Volume III (I think...at least Amazon was not showing me the other 9 volumes). One should buy all ten volumes.Other lexicons that may be valuable for your library include Ceslas Spiq's. I also use Louw & Nida Semantic Domain study.Let me make a comment about the review which criticizes TDNT for 'exegetical fallacies'. I think this reviewer is overly zealous to apply Carson's exegetical fallacies. I use Carson's book and recommend it highly (see my review on it). But to suggest that Kittle commits exegetical fallacies galore is not at all in line with my experience in this massive Theological Dictionary. It is an unfair criticism.I think if your profession involves studying God's Word in depth, and especially the NT Greek, then you really need this series in your library so that you can compare your findings with other lexicons to this one. All the great scholars do, so that tells you something.I highly recommend this series. Go for it.

I've used this in small group bible studies and as an aid for sermon ideas. Although Stott sometimes injects reformed theology into his interpretation of verses, or he sometimes brings in 'pithy phrases' that sound good but may not be accurate (see my review of his commentary on Ephesians for details), there are many great discussion starters in this study guide that will help a discussion leader get on track to a fruitful discussion. Some of the best meetings we've had involved the use of questions right out of this book. For technical accuracy and cross checking I would suggest F.F. Bruce's commentary on Ephesians as a companion. If Bruce concurs with Stott then you know that probably 90% of evangelical scholars are in line....if Bruce doesn't concur or even bother to refute Stott, then you know it's probably just one of the more rare 'pithy phrases' which doesn't really flow out of the text, but has been inserted into the text by Stott. Normally he doesn't do that so it's not a frequent problem.Ephesians is the prince of epistles, as some call it. A book worth spending additional money on if you are leading a group through these six chapters. We spent the better part of a year on the first four chapters in one group I lead and the people are just loving it. It's very rich. The method we've used is essentially what is laid out in this guide. So I recommend you get this guide, Bruce's commentary...also Stott's commentary is really good for discussion/preaching as well.Above all else, stay focused on Jesus while working through this...and He will guide you to the truth on each point in the text. So I heartily recommend you purchase this study guide if you are preaching through Ephesians or if you are leading a study of Ephesians.

I'm a pastor who uses this study guide in my Galatians Small Group, and sometimes for sermon exegesis. One of the great things about this guide is that Stott asks a lot of great questions which build on each other. For a bible study leader, his questions are excellent discussion starters. Some of the most penetrating questions we have dealt with in our study of Galatians have come straight out of this guide.I would recommend a different IVP author for a matching commentary...check out Ann Jervis on Galatians or Ron Fung (NICNT). Those two seem to be more interactive on the key issues throughout Galatians than Stott is in his commentary. But for a study guide, this one here is the best I have found. I recommend you get this. It will help you a lot!The reason I recommend a commentary to go with this, is because Stott doesn't give a lot of information about Galatians in this book. It's important to note that this is not a commentary, only a study guide.

This practical guide helps the sermon exegete from a number of excellent angles. For example, the author provides a glimpse at how to arrange the minor prophets with the major prophets in the OT by timeline or by themes for preaching.I will write more as I dig into this tool. For now, let me say that what I have seen is very helpful and I'm glad I bought a copy.I am taking Dr. Walton for an Ancient Near Eastern course at Wheaton. I find him to be an excellent teacher. His knowledge of the subject and his style of communication help open up whole new worlds of understanding for the Old Testament. I think anything he has written is probably worth owning if you are a bible teacher or preacher.

I am a pastor doing sermon research in commentaries. D. A. Carson recommends it in his NT Commentary Survey. So I bought it.This commentary has been a large disappointment primarily because the material is primarily about which parts of the verses were written by Luke, and which parts were recorded from other sources. It lacks the fire and depth on things that would help illuminate someone studying the text for the first time.I would recommend this book only for scholars who do a lot of speculation on source theories AND who don't care about application ideas or topics.Let me illustrate what I mean with the last entry I used in this commentary. I was doing a prep for a talk on Acts 8:1-8. I found his comments on Acts 8:1b read as follows:Acts 8:1 At that time there arose a severe persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and all were dispersed through the districts of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles....This short paragraph is probably Luke's own work, an introduction to the combined stories, in chs. 8-12, of Paul, Peter, Philip and the unnamed disciples who took the Gospel to Antioch. Chronological sequence throughout these chapters is obscure, and the present paragraph lacks any clarity.He has 18 lines of this sort of material. Then he gives commentary on the actual text which reads like this...1b. At that time. literally. On that day. Luke means that the persecution followed without delay. For the Church see on 5.11 and Introduction, pp. lviif. So far as Luke has told us, there was at this time no church except in Jerusalem. Like the Jewish, the Christian Diaspora (limited at this time to Judaea and Samaria) was in part due to persecution. all were dispersed. Luke excepts the apostles in view of 9.26f. Luke presumablymeant what he wrote, but there may well have been other exceptions.That is his commentary on 8:1. I felt like I had wasted my time and money!I found the little Tyndale commentary to be much more helpful on the book of Acts.Here is Marshall's Tyndale commentary on 8:1 (btw-it's less expensive than Barrett's $35 abridged volume).1b The successful attack on Stephen was the signal for a wider attack on the church in Jerusalem, no doubt, instigated by the same group that had attacked him. This is the first occurrence of the word persecution in Acts (except for the verb in 7:52).[he goes on with another 12 lines of useful commentary on verse 1.]Note that there is nothing about the speculation of 'did Luke write this or use someone else's material' that Barrett seems preoccupied with. Frankly, for pastors and bible teachers, Marshall's stuff is way more helpful. So my recommendation is that only people who are really into speculation on the 'original sources' purchase Barrett. If you are doing bible study, teaching or preaching from Acts in general, spend your dollars on other resources.

We have used this tool since it came out. I've found that this tool is best for easily organizing the 'how to' stuff of small group leadership. It does not cover the ministerial philosophy issues. A good book for that is 'Master Plan of Evangelism' by Robert Coleman.As the title for this book says, it covers nine keys for effective small group leadership. Each key really has four or five sub points...so in reality it is nine times about five...or forty five keys if you will. But George has organized them into nine groups...or keys.We've found that leaders who study this material are easier to work with and easier to build a vision with for a local church ministry. There are a lot of books on Small Group Leadership that will help you. This one is very practical. It's so well written you can use it even if all you do is read the paragraph headers. Everything is well explained and easy to find or follow.So even for leaders who don't like to read or who you suspect will not read everything you ask them to read, this book still might get through to them. I recommend it as a curriculum text for a course in a local church/ministry for leading small groups.Enjoy it!

I bought this book because it seemed like it might be really good.Normally I don't give a two star to a book, and especially to such a noted author. But I really feel cheated by this book. I bought it because I thought it would add some inspirational insights to my studies of 1 & 2 Peter. Let me give you a quick review of what I found and why I will not use this book much, and why I cannot recommend it for someone studying 1 & 2 Peter.This book has 120 pages, and is about 6 1/2 by 9 1/2" with some nice artwork in gray scale on the inside of each page. However, over half of the pages have perhaps two or three questions on them with a few inches of space to write the answers in. The questions are typical of an inductive bible study-except that these questions actually miss the key point of the passage sometimes. So really this is more of a workbook, than 'life lessons'.Secondly, the material that I evaluated in-depth singles out only one part of a passage and asks questions about that part. The rest of the passage is overlooked. In fact, the great themes of the passage, which are far richer in my opinion, are not even addressed at all! That's just tragic!Let's zoom in on 2 Peter 1 (chapter 10 in Lucado's book) so I can illustrate my point.There are ten pages in this 120 page book devoted to chapter 10. Of those ten pages, the first page is just a title with artwork in gray. Then on the next page you have a short paragraph of 'reflection' with about two inches of space for you to write your answer to the question that paragraph asks. Then he gives a paragraph on 'Situation' which is really just the chapter of 2 Peter 1 in the NCV text, and then the NKJ text following that with instructions to read either version. Unfortunately the text is quite long AND italicized, which makes it less pleasant to read.Then we have a section called 'Exploration'. This is one question after another with 2 inches of blank space after each question so you can write your answers in the book.So the first five pages of the chapter consist of two very short paragraphs, some very simple artwork, a title, the Bible text in two different versions (not my two favorite versions either), and a lot of blank paper.The next section is called Inspiration and is a clip from his popular book Traveling Light. It's good, talking about the nature of God who is an unchanging Spirit, which ties into the passage. This sets up a key point later in the chapter, which I will get to.The response? More questions with 2 inches of blank space after each one.So now on the 9th page of this 10 page chapter we have half way down a section called "Life Lessons". Here Max Lucado contends that God cannot move any closer to us because He is unchanging...so therefore we must move closer to God. Immediately I thought of songs and scriptures that seem to contradict this (ESV James 4:8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.) I don't believe this teaches God will move in his nature, but He will draw nearer to us by allowing us to experience Him personally. Because Max doesn't talk at all about this, it's hard to know what he means. Unfortunately I was left wondering if he even thought about this problem. Yet in-spite of this popular verse that seems to contradict what he is saying, he doesn't address that at all.Then he gives a prayer which is good. The last page is titled Journaling and is blank.Honestly, this chapter could have been written in half an hour. Cut and paste passages from two versions of the Bible and cut and paste text from a previously published book that kind of matches the topic and voila!There is one big problem with this chapter. The title and theme of this chapter is actually NOT the theme of 2 Peter 1. He titles it self-discipline. But 2 Peter 1 is about living out an overcoming faith, and self-discipline is one component of that...but it is not the main thought at all. It's about cultivating faith! Self-control is one of the issues Peter mentions that we are to make every effort to add to our faith. He covers 7 qualities to add to our faith, crescendoing to the very most important of all. Love. So I not only didn't appreciate the extremely skimpy "Life Lesson" on 2 Peter 1. I believe he missed the point of the passage...thereby causing his readers to focus on the wrong aspect of Peter's lesson in 2 Peter 1.Here is the heart of the segment in 2 Peter 1 that he seems to draw his title and focus from. Please just read it and you will see that 'self-discipline' is clearly not the theme. ESV 2 Peter 1:5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, 6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, 7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.The theme is faith, built up by all of these seven qualities...the last of which is love!So I guess I should mark this book a 1 star, but I can't. That's because I really like Max Lucado in general and his other books that I have are very good. So let me end by saying that this one should be completely redone...or retitled if Nelson wants to make real Impact with it.

This book is not a detailed step-by-step method for fund raising. It is a book designed to help set the attitudes of your heart in a place where you can begin to pursue your call from God as a faith based missionary. In essence she builds her teaching around four pillars of truth. Each of these pillars represents a specific principle which she effectively opens up with plenty of clear illustrations and scripture to reinforce the point. The book is written in a style that is easy to read and will impact your heart. The four pillars she gives are: Friend Raising, Generosity, Communication, Prayer with Promises.After these she goes into practical issues, identifying and removing hindrances, showing it can work anywhere, and building your faith with stories of these teachings working. She also gives some tips on newsletters that are helpful.Perhaps my favorite part of the book is the section where she gives a string of scriptures to help you overcome discouragement. It's placed at a point in the book where a missionary will naturally start to become discouraged unless they are boosted by God. She put a long list of scriptures there with some text so that you get the encouragement on the spot.The author has a long experiential history on this subject and so she writes with a kind of authority that is far from ivory tower teachings. She is like a veteran soldier writing from the trenches to tell new soldiers what to do and how to survive in the trenches of the spiritual war that we are fighting...no more than survive...how to thrive. I think this is a GREAT book.I am transitioning from the pastorate to a faith based mission. So I personally am struggling with many of the issues that she raises in this book. A friend who is coaching me recommended this book. I also picked up a few others on this subject. After perusing them all, this one drew me in. I'm now thinking it's so good that I need to have my whole family read it so we are all on the same page. I don't know if I will actually do that, but it gives you the feeling I have as I've read it.This book really has impacted me the most in knocking out unhealthy attitudes about fund raising from my heart...convicting me and leading me to change rather quickly...laying a biblical foundation for fund raising (she focuses on friend raising), and providing practical tips for immediate use. (She talks about writing thank you notes immediately after receiving donations). However, some of her tips are antiquated electronically and need to be updated. It's just one or two little things though.I think that this book should be at the front of the line for any missionary or campus minister who is raising support to do a good work for the Lord. If you have only a few bucks to spend on this topic (a reasonable guess I suppose), get this book. It probably be one that you keep nearby as you raise support for your work for God.

First let me say that I am a pastor working through Galatians. I have looked at about at least 30 or 35 commentaries either a little or quite a bit. This one has ended up on my short list of favorites. Although I don't use it every time I work on a passage, it is one that gets used a lot.Here's what I love about it:This commentary lays out a review of the passage he deals with in a logical and clear fashion that is easy to follow. He gives good bullet points that are easy to follow reviewing even some theological ramifications of the passage at hand. It's practical and deals with issues most readers will want to understand. He does not spend a lot of time on difficult to follow minutia. Yet at the same time he does give a lot of good perspective. For preachers, some of his phrases will preach well.Some of his illustrations are fresh and innovative. For example, he illustrates the addition of the law/legalism over Christ's work on the cross (Galatians 5) by talking about a baseball that is autographed by Babe Ruth. The owner of the baseball, seeing Babe's signature is faded, decides to take out a marker and write B-A-B-E R-U-T-H on it...right over the original signature. The effect is to make the ball worthless. In the same way, trying to add our works via the law or on our own has that effect to Christ's work on the cross. It obliterates it. So we should trust in Christ's work on the cross, not our own or our efforts through the law of Moses.Now there is one weakness in this book. I would expect a commentary that says 'Reformed' on the cover to present the reformed view. He does, however, what he fails to do is present CONVINCING arguments for rejecting Arminianism. For example, in Galatians 5, he says that since eternal security cannot be lost, therefore the passage which says 'you are severed from Christ' cannot deal with eternal security. The problem with that approach is that it only works with some Calvinists. Nobody I know wants to be told a certain view cannot be true because of a hotly debated theological vantage point must eliminate ones interpretation. Especially when that is one of the hallmark verses of the whole debate!!! When a Reformed scholar deals with one of the key Arminian texts, I really am a bit disappointed to read 'it must be the Calvinists way because of other passages in the bible...therefore we have to skate away from the text here and add some additional meaning to understand it' (my own paraphrase). Surely Calvinist scholars have better arguments for their position (they do!).He goes on to say it must mean expelled from the church or community of believers. Even though the text bears nothing that warrants this extension, he claims it must be that way, essentially because Calvinism is the truth.So for Arminians, this is an exceptionally unconvincing approach. For Calvinists, it may not bother them, unless they are trying to persuade their Arminian friends. In spite of this flaw (what book outside the bible is perfect?), Ryken has done a tremendous job in my opinion.Overall, this commentary is superior to most of the others for lay leaders/bible teachers, pastors and perhaps undergraduate bible students.My copy is all marked up and I'm sure if you buy one you will enjoy it. I will continue to use it and because of this commentary will look for other books by this author.I heartily recommend it for all bible students.

This commentary is thorough and helpful for the process of exegeting the book of Hebrews. I'm a pastor who is working through Hebrews for pulpit ministry. Hebrews is a rich book, with a lot of linguistic nuances, which are not covered in most commentaries that I have looked at recently.I think that one of the values for this commentary shines through if you use the Greek text. This is highlighted in the way that the author organizes his material. So let me review that first so you catch the flavor of his work.For each pericope the author provides his own translation of the passage. For example, in Hebrews 11:1-7 he starts out with the rarely seen "Faith is the reality of things hoped for..." rather than the more popular 'Faith is the assurance of things hoped for'The book cover is 9.5" tall and 8.5" wide from the binding to the edge. This gives extra wide margins on each page, and a feeling that the volume is almost square. I like the feel of this commentary more than most I own. Sometimes he strays into a realm of discussion that betrays a bias against the infallibility of scripture, which may be a problem for some Evangelicals (like myself...I find those comments irritating). But Attridge limits those to minor bits here and there and it is an insignificant part of his commentary as a whole.His translation is in the left margin of a whole page and is in large fonts that are bold and easy to read (I really like that). The right column has his own textual critical notes focused on interesting things. For example he explains a variant on Hebrews 11:1 in p13 (that's papyrus 13, not page 13).If you are following all the steps of exegesis, this can be an interesting addition to Metzger's GNT Textual Commentary (A commentary on the Greek Textual Selections for the NA27th edition and UBS3rd and 4th editions).After his translation and textual commentary notes, he provides an analysis of the passage. In his analysis he gives an interesting review of the structure of the language, it's relationship to previous and following paragraphs, and a lot of helpful input on the whole of what he is discussing (in this case the whole of Hebrews 11:1-7 and on Hebrews 11). His command of ancient sources is convincing and well documented in footnotes throughout the book.After his Analysis section, then he enters into his 'Comment'. In this section he works bit by bit through the paragraph, giving sometimes an indepth word study (when appropriate). For example in Hebrews 11:1 we find a word 'upotasis' which he analyzes in depth. His analysis systematically evaluates the pros and cons of each view on the word and then finally lands on his own view. In this particular word, I had been convinced by FF Bruce's evaluation in his Hebrews commentary, but am forced to rethink things after reading Attridge in this commentary. The convincing element in his evaluation of the view Bruce and other propose was that there are no instances in ancient literature that support Bruce's position on the word. Bruce used parallelism to make his case, but Attridge shot that down in a paragraph in this book. I found more material to digest and the material was laid out in a way that I find it easy to grasp (I'm a pastor, not a scholar). Attridge's footnotes in all of this range from quoting German scholars and theologians to ancient Greeks or ancient Jewish historians to modern English and French Greek language experts (like Spicq, Moulton, Koester, etc...).Sometimes Attridge provides an excursus on the text. In Hebrews 11:1-7 he does this, by focusing on Faith in Hebrews and Contemporary Literature. This excursion is several pages long. Then he resumes his commentary on the verses bit by bit.The entire section on Hebrews 11:1-7 provides the pastor working on a sermon or the student/scholar reviewing material 26 pages of well thought out material to use for your exegetical process. I don't know if you will agree with him on every conclusion, but he is much more thorough than almost all of my Hebrews commentaries (I have consulted at least 25 commentaries on Hebrews). One huge difference between this commentary and the NIGTC on Hebrews by Ellingworth, is illustrated in this passage. Attridge doesn't spend time reviewing theories on how Hebrews 11 was assembled or slugging through the various 'educated guesses' on source material. Of the 21 pages Ellingworth gives us on this same pericope, he spends the first three on the various 'educated guesses' on source material...ending with the classic result that we don't really know. And I always think...and we don't really care either because it doesn't really matter. Honestly when I am exegeting a passage of scripture for a sermon I don't want 15% of my commentary assistance to be focused on wild speculation on the origination of the text. Unless it really has a true bearing and the results are somewhat convincing, commentators do no service to pastors by spending so much time on things like this. For this reason in particular, and for the deeper coverage on critical issues like crucial word studies and excursions that matter, I favor Attridge's commentary on Hebrews over Ellingworth's commentary on Hebrews.I have come to heartily recommend this commentary for analysis of the Greek text in the exegetical process of sermon development.The weakness I see here is that he does not give a pastor a lot of 'life application' handles that can preach well. Since the commentary is billed as a "Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible" I didn't expect that from this commentary. So I think he hits his target dead on.Update to this review added 11/2008: During my latest sermon series through Genesis, I decided to focus on Revelations of Christ in Genesis. One message in our outline is on Melchizedek and Christ. The primary texts are Genesis 14, Hebrews 5-7, Psalm 110. Of course when I went back to my library of Hebrews commentaries I looked to see if any of them had an excursion on Melchizedek. To my delight Attridge has one where he traces for four pages the Jewish Apocalyptic references to Melchizedek (including Qumran, Philo and a number of others with helpful footnotes all the way through for further research).Attridge also gives 8 pages on a similar excursion called "The Antecedents and Development of the High-Priestly Christology" starting on pg 97. So the combination of these two excursions gives 12 pages reviewing related material throughout the ancient world. Everything is footnoted with primary and secondary sources. The only thing I would adjust in the footnotes is the failure to translate original language notes. If you don't read German and Greek then some things are impossible to read because he uses original language fonts. But if you read Greek even some, then this can be a delight!So this commentary is also helpful when studying Old Testament books IF you decide to focus on the New Testament use of the Old Testament. I'm really glad I bought this one, and recommend it even more now!

First I want to say that the book is not so bad in it's formatting as some people say. I have a Kindle DX and used it on there. I've had trouble with the actual explanations of grammar rules in this book though and am writing this review to rebut the five star review that encouraged me to buy it. My recommendation is that you keep looking. Do not buy this book.Shortly after using this book I found myself surfing the internet to see what others say about the rules. That's because I was thoroughly confused by this grammar. Here's an example from the rules on tone change.The explanation of 'Third tone change: Third tone is spoken as second tone when it occurs before another third tone--they give pinyin here saying 'ni hao' becomes 'ni hao' (ALL FOUR SYLLABLES HAVE THIRD TONES IN THE GRAMMAR--I'm not joking!--so how am I supposed to understand this?).And so I was instantly confused.I'm thinking...oh they must assume everyone knows since it's so basic. Or I'm thinking they put that in there because it's understood. But then I thought, this is the explanation to help us know what's 'understood'. I was confused. And I thought how can there be an error on the most basic element in Chinese grammar: Tone rules! So I thought they must be assuming we know what they are talking about. But that thought was quickly rejected when I read the next example in pinyin. 'wo xihuan becomes wo xihuan' (with the tone markings showing the shift. The second wo has a second tone marking instead of third tone. So which example is correct? (Since I cannot put tone markers here I cannot show it...but in the book it has tone marker errors right in the text that is supposed to explain tone marking rules!!!) Using the number system, I can demonstrate what this grammar does: ni3 hao3 becomes ni3 hao3. wo3 xi3huan becomes wo2 xi3huan I hope you get what they did wrong.In short, IT'S TERRIBLE!!I was dizzy with confusion as a new student when I read that. So I laid my Kindle reader down and jumped on my laptop and looked in google for Chinese Grammar tone changes. I found much clearer examples in a few seconds on the web. Then when my tutor came I asked her which was correct.On the same page this grammar also was missing some of the uses for yi, qi, ba tone changes based on certain circumstances. My tutor rattled off the correct ones. My tutor read the rules on tone changes and claimed this book was wrong. She was pretty adamant about it. I had checked websites on the internet and that's how I found the correct answer. There are more errors on the same page. But on that page alone I found two significant errors that made me lose confidence in this book. As I continued to read, I found more errors. I will not chronicle them because these are significant enough in my opinion to warrant my stated conclusion. If a Chinese grammar cannot accurately explain the double third tone rule, what can it explain? How am I supposed to trust it? So my recommendation is that you do not buy this grammar.BTW-to find the tone change rules in this book you need to use the search function on Kindle. It doesn't have a table of contents. But I think almost any grammar point can be found in this book on a Kindle by using the Kindle "search this book" function. Just can't trust the explanations to be accurate. Did they hire an editor who knew Chinese grammar? To find things in this book on a Kindle DX, Click the menu button and go down to 'search this book'. Then type in tone change (or whatever grammar rule you want to look up) and a number of hits come up.Oh some people complain that this book has too small characters. But the characters on the screen are larger and more readable than the 'keyboard' at the bottom of a Kindle DX. So the people complaining about readability probably can't see the characters on their keyboard either and just need glasses. Or maybe it's different on smaller Kindles?

I have four daughters. One of them spilled a bottle of nail polish on our brand new kitchen table before I had a chance to put a sealant on it. So, I bought some sand paper and a sanding block and removed the entire surface of the table. We then stained it with a Minwax Red Oak stain. (Don't get Minwax). It was terrible. So, we investigated what to do. When I learned that the best solution was to resand the entire table, I decided to buy a new sander. (My Black & Decker iron shaped sander just wasn't very good). Because I've had a good experience with a Porter Cable biscuit joiner, and because of good reviews on the 342 model, I decided to get one.Let me talk about this Sander. First of all-it's not a 1/4 sheet literally. That's just a name. It takes almost 1/3 of a sheet of sand paper. So if you are planning a project, count on three pieces per sheet, not four. Some people complained about how to cut a sheet of paper and put the sanding paper on the unit. Honestly I figured it out without reading the instructions in less than 3 minutes. It's very simple. But to save you the 3 minutes, here's what to do:Just take a ruler and mark off on the back of a sheet of sand paper at 4 3/8" by 5 7/8". Then cut it with a pair of scissors. Push the levers in a bit and then swing each side up. Slip the sand paper into each end and swing the levers back to their original position. There should be no slack. Then use the hole punch form and punch holes in the sand paper. IF you do this, you will have virtually zero dust in your project.This unit has a palm grip that is very comfortable. It also had more oscillations than the other sanders I looked at (14,000 OPM vs 12,000 OPM). It also has a 3 yr limited warranty (the box doesn't say this on the outside-but it has a pretty impressive warranty for a small hand power tool). Instead of using the dust bags that can leak more easily, a hard plastic cannister slides onto and twist locks onto a plastic connector that attaches to the back of the sander. This connector slides onto a well designed vacuum port that has an o-ring to keep the dust from leaking. My unit did not leak. However, the o-ring came a little loose before I slid it on, and I had to press it into position for the unit to work correctly. No big deal at all. I like the o-ring idea. Good engineering concept. A cannister has the advantage of not dropping down onto a table when you turn off the power. It's virtually leak proof. I thought I would not like this feature, but now that I've used it, I prefer it. the port could also have a vacuum hose to a vacuum system or wet-vac hooked up to it, but I love the little cannister.This unit is so powerful, that I would not recommend using it with one hand, although a pretty strong person could do that, it tends to wander if you use one hand for me anyhow. So use two hands. The power cord is a bit heavier gage than most power tools of this size. I appreciated that too. It's about 8 feet long, but it does not have a grounding connector. I don't like the two prong connectors that many tools have recently come out with. What's up with that anyhow?This unit also has a 3 screw access panel on top of the handle. This makes it easier to access the unit for repair or cleaning. The screws are recessed so you cannot feel them when using the unit. The rubber grip is soft yet strong. Excellent material.The vibration on this unit is pretty quiet compared to other tools with a similar number of strokes per minute. For example, it's a lot quieter than my well loved Dremel tool. It's about the same volume of noise as other finishing sanders.For my project, I found that 100 grade sand paper with this tool did not take all the stained wood off. I need a bit rougher paper with this sander. So I recommend using a 60 grade to start with. If you are working on veneered finishes, I wouldn't use a belt sander. I would use this sander. It doesn't cut too deeply. It's smooth, very clean (you can use it in a regular home without creating a sawdust storm), and worthy of a five star rating.It uses only 2.4 Amps...so any power line in your house or shop can service this tool and several other things at the same time.This tool's a keeper. Glad I have it in my shop!

I am a pastor who does pre-marital counseling and/or marriage counseling. I've found there are some very simple tips in this book (simple yet profound). Some of the basic tips they cover in this book have helped some of the couples I work with. My experience has been that most authors who write on marriage do not do their own research. The Parrott's seem to be an exception to this norm.They blend biblical concepts, research, and their own material to provide practical tips for growing in relationships. They are refreshing and easy to read.The book has four pairs of tips. One pair for daily help, one pair for weekly, one for monthly and one for annual.I started out looking for books/resources by Christian marriage experts who could help provide guides on how to have a great marriage (there are plenty of things dealing with dysfunctional marriages). about 5 years ago, I found the Parrott's to be the best (I'm not a marriage expert, just a pastor who has been looking at some of the resources out there). I've found that their tips have helped my own marriage a lot, and I would venture to say that partially because of the tips in this book and ones like it, my own marriage has improved a lot. I've also seen people who apply the tips in this book improve.One aid they have is a little clear stick on plastic sheet in the back of the book which gives you the 8 Love List Items on a 'cheat sheet'. What I did was put that stick on sheet (it's about 1.5" by 2") on my mirror in my bathroom. So when I am getting ready to go for the day, I remember to do the daily tips on the sheet. There are two stick on sheets, one for the husband and one for the wife-so we each have one up on over our own sinks.You could put them on your car rearview mirror or in the corner of a windshield, but I think it's safer to put them in the bathroom.In addition there is a good site with some basic tips for free at tipsformarriage dot blogspot . That is my site. The Parrott's have a site that is called real relationships (google it). You might want to check that out as well. Whatever the case, I heartily recommend this little book. The tips are things you can learn and that help most couples a lot.I hope you enjoy it!

This is the kind of set you can listen to over and over without getting bored. It's a fantastic package of songs and I highly recommend it as a gift or for yourself.Some of the songs can leave you weeping or stirred in the depths of your spirit towards God.

As a pastor preaching through the Old and New Testaments, I often run into quotes from the Apocrypha as well as other ancient literature. My theological training did not focus on the Apocrypha, and so it was only recently that I started really studying these books. There are a wide range of books on the Apocrypha, and so far, I have to say that this particular book is the most helpful of the ones that I've used or purchased.At 6x9 inches, this paper back is a hefty 400+ pages long. The white paper and large font size make it easier to read than most books. Also the layout of the book is encouraging for just sitting down to read through a section. This is because deSilva breaks the material into bite size chunks that are easy to digest. Be aware however that this book does not actually have the Apocrypha in it. It does not have any translation of the Apocrypha. It only introduces you to the apocrypha.A few negatives: His format for the content varies from book to book. So how he organizes his material in 2 Maccabees is similar to, but not the same as he does for 4 Maccabees (as an example). This has strengths and weaknesses. It's good for customization, but it's weak for setting expectations and delivering on what you were hoping to see for each book. One thing that I wish was clearly marked for each Apocryphal book was a segment on Theology. He does this for some of the books, but not all of them.This book really delivers exceptionally well on the goal implicit in the title. When you are done, you have a great introduction to the Apocrypha.He generally gives a great summary of each book, it's Purpose and Genre, Structure/Form, Influence, Theology, Author/Date/Setting, and something on the Textual Transmission.Let me zoom in on the 2 Maccabees section to illustrate.For 2 Maccabees he gives 15 pages of material. After two paragraphs opening things up, he gives a few pages on the Structure, Contents and Textual Transmission of 2 Maccabees. This is worth reading, but it is very much like a 'Cliff Notes' of 2 Maccabees. He hits all the high points in a clearly organized and memorable fashion. The only irritation I had was the regular use of vocabulary I am not used to hearing, however he limited this to a few words at the most, so it's only a minor thing. Some in fact might enjoy expanding their vocabulary as they read a book. I find myself stopping to search online to see if a word is spelled correctly or if it has a clear meaning in context. In this chapter he kept using odd forms of the word legitimate. I never hear legitimating, but he uses it. And he says 'to legitimate' where most would say 'to make legitimate'. He also uses variations of 'epitome' and 'epitomator' through-out this chapter. After looking it up, I found myself enjoying that though.Some of his summary paragraphs are so well written you could almost read them to a congregation straight out of this book! Not too many scholars write that clearly.Next he goes to Author, Date and Setting for a few more pages. I prefer to read B.C./A.D., but he uses B.C.E./C.E. instead. Otherwise it's about as good as you can make that sort of topic.Then he covers Genre and Purpose. With nearly two pages on that he summarizes the general view of groups of scholars without getting into the nitty gritty of their views. His summaries are helpful and laced with enough citations that you can dig further if you like.Formative Influences are reviewed here in less than a page.Then he goes on to "The History that 2 Maccabees crafts". These 3 1/2 pages are unique to this book, with some of the other books containing unique elements for them as well. This is where deSilva shines by providing a custom glimpse into important matters with each book. He discusses what we know about the sources used for forming 2 Maccabees, like Jason of Cyrene's five volume lost history of the Maccabees.After this he has one page on the Honor, Shame, and Jewish Cultural Values. Then he shifts to Eschatology, discussing the doctrine of the resurrection and how it was impacted by 2 Maccabees. Finally, he has a section that most other books have, called Influence. (Some of the books substitute Theology for the Eschatology section).I think the most important part of "Introducing the Apocrypha" is the Influence section for each Apocryphal book. Not only does he discuss how the book influenced Jewish thought and life and doctrine, but how it affected early Christianity.If I could say one thing to David deSilva, it would be "Thanks and well done!" If I could recommend one book on the Apocrypha for Christians everywhere to purchase and read through, this would be it (besides the Apocrypha itself).Oh, that's one thing that would make this even better. If this book was enlarged to provide the actual text of the Apocrypha with more cross references after each introduction, it would be fantastic. As it is, it's an excellent tool. I gladly recommend it for your study and reading in general.

I got this cd years ago and some of the songs on it are still on my favorites list. The title cut "True North" is about how we have lost our way in this world, but Jesus is the one we can find our bearings through by orienting our life around him. It's a powerful song that still ministers to my spirit.Twila has a purity and humility about her music that is rare, inspiring and worth depositing into your spirit. It's not just good music, it ministers to your inner being.I recommend this cd without reservation.As a Pastor, sometimes I will listen to this cd in my pastoral study as part of my worship time in preparation for a sermon. This cd is that good.I've been blessed by this cd for many years now. I still recommend it!

I found this book in a Souix Indian Tribe Bookstore in the Dakotas a long time ago. (For the reviewers who think it is racist, why do Indian bookstores feature this book then?)After reading the amazing story of the Oatman family and what happened to them, I understood the reason why Americans rose up and insisted that the government squelch Indian uprisings in the West and Southwest. This book destroyed many popular myths in my mind about Indian culture and American English culture in the 19th century. It also reveals a lot of detail about the way these two sub tribes of the Apache & Mohave Nations lived. The good and the bad are depicted side by side. For example, the Oatman girls were apparently never molested by the Apache or the Mohave, but they were treated pretty harshly at times (not to mention the unprovoked murder of their parents).The account of the difference in lifestyle between the two tribes that held the Oatman girls is also very interesting (at least for me it was fascinating). It was like looking back into history and seeing things from a perspective you would NEVER see in the movies.It shows that the tribes varied quite a bit, and that America was reluctant to send out the Cavalry-at least in this case. But this book may have been the trigger that changed the reluctance into a "righteous" indignation.I think it also reveals something about one Mormon family who travelled (or tried to travel) to California...and what happened to them on the way. The spirituality of the family (if the account is accurate) is remarkable and the customs of other religious people around them are as well. (I'm not a Mormon). The book is not about spreading religion, be does exhibit the religious practice and character of many of the people in the story in detail.This book shows how the US government was slow to rescue people who were captives...and how the power of the free press turned that around. For when this book was first published, it was a best seller in the USA. The newspapers in the west coast apparently splashed this story throughout LA. Apparently it created a groundswell public outcry that the military provide safer passageways across this vast land.I think every American should be required to read this as part of a US History class. I'm sure some of the accounts are hyped a bit...but one cannot help but feel they are looking into history from the authentic eyes of a 19th century history shaping author. And that it brings one far closer to something that happened, that may have been very important to changing the way the US Government dealt with Indian tribes out west, even though it is clear not all tribes acted as the ones in this book did.I highly recommend this book!
