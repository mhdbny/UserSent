John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme" is one of the best jazz albums, and one of the best albums of the 20th century for a few good reasons: The biggest is the fact that this album is music in its purest and most honest form; Music is an expression of emotions, a personal outlet to display to the world. Happiness, sadness, joy, anger, frustration, confusion, silliness, love, excitement...all of these things can be embodied. And John Coltrane and the rest of these amazing musicians do just that on this album. They create a mystical, surreal experience of pure emotions that take you in an amazing trip.Everything from the piano to the drumming, the bass guitar to Coltrane's saxophone, all make this an experience beyond words. The musicianship is amazing, the songwriting is well-developed and professional, and the atmosphere is constantly mystifying. From the opening note, we are taken into a world of the surreal, a world of love, a summery sunset of some otherworldly afterglow only reachable through music. And John Coltrane is one of the greatest tenor saxophonists, as well! His playing is very intricate, honest and emotional, he's a very accomplished musician and he knows how to play to make even the most extended solo interesting. As a musician myself, I take this as inspiration to expand my own musical horizons and musical skills. The way he formulates the progression of notes, the way he releases some, waits, then continues on, is something only so many great musicians can do.So, in short, "A Love Supreme" is indeed a supreme output of music. This is music in its purest form, extremely enjoyable, and the sort of album you can love forever. Very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

With this review getting me past the halfway point in my "31 horror movie reviews for the 31 days of October" concept I had, leading up to the 31st by Halloween, I figure I should add my input on yet another classic, namely "Tremors." "Tremors" is one of those movies with a universal appeal, whether or not you're a hardcore fan of horror movies. It's got a strong plot, consistent series of events, awesome action and intensity, and characters that are very likable and the kind you want to see survive. Although it's not as graphic as other movies of the genre, highlighted by the PG-13 rating, there are some good monster-related gore scenes, like when a construction worker jackhammers a monster through the ground and blood bubbles up. There's also a lot of good laughs throughout the movie, including some brilliant one-liners that make for some down-to-earth comedy. Even more, we have a budding romance in the sub-plot that makes for a happy ending at the end. The monsters, although are kept underground in the earlier half of the movie, are amazing when shown. And of course, great monsters make a great monster movie.The sound and picture quality of the disc is really nice, too. What's more, there's lots of extra features here that beef up the quality of the disc. I actually got this in the "Tremors 4-Pack", which has all four movies in the series, and at a great price too. Overall, I can't think of a single bad thing about this movie, or the disc it comes on. For those seeking a highly-entertaining, down-to-earth monster movie, "Tremors" will sound off a 10 on the Richter Scale! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although there's no Kevin Bacon in this movie, "Tremors 2: Aftershocks" proves itself to be just as good as the original "Tremors". Fred Ward returns to star as Earl Bassett, who know has a large sum of money thanks to the Graboids they hunted in the first movie. He agrees to work down in Mexico to hunt some more Graboids, who surprisingly enough, are above ground this time around! This makes for an interesting and new spin, and the Graboids in this movie remind me of smaller versions of the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park".This movie also has the same down-to-earth charm as the first movie and well, the other two "Tremors" movies, too! There's lots of great character development, more funny one-liners, and plenty of explosion-based action to boot! With a satisfying and happy ending and plenty of extra features to boot, I can't think of a single bad thing about the movie or the disc. Highly recommended, although be sure to get it on the "Tremors 4-Pack". Thanks for the time, and peace.

The first time I saw "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was at about two o'clock in the morning, by myself, in total darkness. And by the end of this movie, my shocked eyes were about the size of the TV screen. Oddly enough, "TCM" is the only movie to date where I bought the DVD while I still had the rental copy. That's how quickly I needed to own this movie.Now, despite the title "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", this movie is NOT a gorefest. It is a progressive, low-budget and very realistic movie that builds up with time.There's just something about this movie that puts it in a category of its own. The atmospheric, backwoods setting, the raw camera and the un-movie feel of it. It doesn't entirely feel like a movie, more like a documentary or one of those experimental films on Youtube...that is, if Youtube were around 30 plus years ago.Although three of the murders occur within the first, fifty minutes, it's the last half-hour of the movie that will make you hide beneath your couch pillows. The final attack and that extended chase scene is nothing short of outstandingly jawdropping. Between the six-foot, 250-pound Leatherface chasing the Texas girl through the forest, Leatherface's psychotic family with their corpse-like grandpa, (who's great at clubbin' their dinner!), and the sheer paranoia, this movie ends up as an edge-of-your-seat atmospheric nightmare that will leave you speechless!In addition to having such a great movie on disc, the DVD comes loaded with extra features, which makes it all a very fun experience! After you're done chilling your bones with the movie, be sure to check out the special features. This DVD is definitely worth your money for lovers of horror.So if you like atmospheric horror, slasher films, and/or something scary and cool that will keep your eyes glued to the television, this will be your Movie of the Week! I haven't checked out the recent remake of this movie, but this mid-70's spine-chilling classic is good enough for me! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Well, it's one day before Halloween and I'm almost done with my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of October" horror movie reviews, so there's one of my favorite that I know I have to review in order to feel good. That movie is "Wes Craven's New Nightmare".I remember first seeing "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" as early as when I was twelve on TV. I remember how scary it was and thinking that it was a movie like this that made Freddy Kreuger such an icon in horror and such a legendary face of terror. Fast-forward to the present day, and here I am, still drooling over this movie. Considering I've seen probably 150 horror movies in the past four years, there should be a good reason why I dig "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" so much. And there is!There are many, many interesting aspects of this movie that make it so great. One thing is the unique concept of the actors playing themselves, which kind of makes you scratch your head in the beginning. Another thing is that it restores that classic feeling that "A Nightmare on Elm Street" gives, where it makes you think something is reality when it's just a dream, and maybe even vice versa. So right from the getgo, there's lots of originality and clever thinking put into this movie, so it's more than just a bloodbath splatter film, it's a film with brains and cunning.Now we're on to the claw-bearing, shadow-creeping, sweater-wearing incubus of the film that is Freddy Kreuger. In this film, he tends to let up on some of the jokes, which MAY seem bad to some Freddy fans, but in this film it works and it shows Freddy's darker, evil side instead of his twisted, comedic side. This works and underlines the fact that he is a horror icon, not just a Hollywood icon.What else is there that can make a horror film so great? Atmosphere and setting! Well for all of you horror fans that seek something atmospheric and having an awesome setting, you're in luck. "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" does a great job of alternating between having the setting as your everyday neighborhood, to a scene in the morgue, to the hospital, to the twisted dreamland in the end of the movie. And the atmosphere that follows it is just as good; it's got such a mystical, surreal element to it. There are bits in the movie, such as when Robert Englund, dressed as Freddy on a news interview, is waving to the audience and stands in front of the light, waving his claws in slow motion...gahh, there are scenes like that one that are just so darkly majestic. Excellent stuff, indeed!What could make this film even better? Well, I don't want to give the ending away, but let's just say that it's epic, delivers a punch and is still a happy ending! Overall, "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" is a film that promises a great element of fantasy, classic horror and some good gore scenes. There's basically nothing wrong with this movie at all, so be sure to get it before Halloween night tomorrow! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"The Quiet Earth" is one of the first movies I think of when I think of the apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic sub-genre of science-fiction and horror films. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as well-known as it should be. Between great ideas, realistically apocalyptic setting, brilliant execution and convincing acting, this movie shines.The movie starts off with a man waking up to find he is completely isolated in town, and how he reacts to the situation, showing the progressive psychological corrosion of him. After this keeps up for a little while, he comes across a few more people and they band together to see if there are any other survivors and what caused this apocalypse.This entire movie had a very surreal, dreamlike feel to it, and it never lost that zing once. It produces such a great atmosphere that you get sucked into the plot and almost hypnotized by how frighteningly realistic this post-apocalyptic world seems. Not to mention wanting to know what happens to the characters and how they interact with each other. The ending was very unique, and as the director said, open to interpretation and perspective, which is what I like about art.Overall, this is an excellent movie that reminds an unspoken classic. Fans of post-apocalyptic sci-fi/horror films are guaranteed to find this masterpiece charming. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Well first off, if you were able to get past the cheesy pun I used in my title, thank you! John Carpenter's "Halloween" is one the all-time horror movie classics, and one of the very first slasher films in horror movie history. Whether or not it was THE first slasher film, a title that's up for grabs between this movie, the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (1974) and the original "Black Christmas" (1976), and even "Blood Feast" (1963), it's a debatable topic.However, whether or not "Halloween" is the absolute first slasher, it's still one of the very best. Why? Simply put, "Halloween" is a movie where everything is done right. There's plenty of character development throughout the movie, the suspense builds as the movie progresses, and unlike in some other horror films, everything that should have an explanation is given (shown in the first scene with Michael Myers as a child, etc.) Another thing I like about this movie is that the whole film is a steady incline towards the end, which is quite the slasher climax! Also, while it's able to build up progressively and draw you in more and more, it's still able to perfect the slasher formula of killing off more and more people throughout the entire course of the film.As I stated before, "Halloween" is a slasher film where everything was done right, unlike certain remakes. In addition, the DVD comes with plenty of extras and you even get to choose between a widescreen and fullscreen format. Overall, this is a great version of the DVD with one of the utmost best horror films ever done. I'm sure most horror fans have seen this movie, but if not, it's very highly recommended. Buy it in time for Halloween, kick back, and let that theme music remind you what a joyous, scary time it is! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Think of any power metal band from the late '80s onward. There's a good chance they were influenced by Iron Maiden's "Somewhere in Time" album. Need proof? Take a listen to the long, progressive songs that take on a futuristic, epic feel to them. The synth-styled guitar and bass work alongside the adventurous lyrics. Even the artwork through this entire album presents music that is both beautiful and influential.All right, so influence isn't the only thing that makes an album great. However, I think that "Somewhere in Time" is, regardless of how influential it is, remains one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. From the larger-than-life opener of "Caught Somewhere In Time", we are taken to a futuristic world in the style of Iron Maiden. Where powerful drumwork and amazing guitar and bass melodies compliment ingenious and adventurous lyrics. Take the effects-driven lead guitar riff, wondrous guitar solo and sing-a-long chorus of "Wasted Years". Even "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" takes a topic like running and makes it seem so much more bold and majestic.Some people may say that adding this tone to classic Iron Maiden may have been a slight mistake on the band's part. This was ironically released in the same year as Judas Priest's "Turbo", which had very similar, futuristic-sounding elements to it. Even though this album is generally remembered as being much better, I happen to like both albums.What you have to remember is to keep an open mind. Don't you think if a band released the same album over and over it would get tiring? Admittedly, "Alexander The Great" runs up a bit short in comparison to the absolute epic of Iron Maiden's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", but that's all right, because the rest of the album is great all the same.Other strong points include "Stranger in a Strange Land" which features a great, opening bassline and another catchy chorus. A personal favorite is "Deja Vu", which seems to be enormously influential in the power metal genre. The driving energy behind the drums, the spacey wah-wah riffing of the guitars, and Bruce's untouchable wailing of "Feel like I've been here before!". And it all ends up being classic Maiden with a new twist to it.So, some people may have mixed feelings about this album. Me? I think it adds an exciting, new element to an already awesome band. This is personally an album I hold in high regards. In my opinion, if you want more great Iron Maiden and have an open mind, this is something I hope you're really gonna love. After all, Maiden's already known for their incredible musicianship and professional songwriting, what's wrong with taking a little trip through time? Speaking of which, thanks for the time, and peace.

With my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of October" project now running in the single digits, there are only a few more horror movies for me to review before I reach my goal of having written 31 horror reviews for the 31 days of October, leading up, of course, to Halloween! And what better addition to my series than an undisputed '80s classic, in this case, "A Nightmare on Elm Street"?Surely most people, horror-fans and non- alike, have at least heard of this movie. But for those that haven't seen it yet, here's a quick rundown. Freddy Kreuger was a child murderer before dying, but now is back as a dream figure, here to haunt and kill you through your dreams, no matter where you are. There's an idea that screams originality, if ever I heard one!This film stars the acting talents of Heather Langenkamp (who's quite the sexy lead chick!), Johnny Depp, and the unforgettable Robert Englund. Also, as it's well-known, this movie was directed by the amazing Wes Craven, one of the top American horror movie directors. So right from the start, we're given a promising cast and director, and that of course signals good things to come. Comparatively, this movie certainly isn't as controversial as earlier Craven masterpieces such as "The Last House on the Left", or "The Hills Have Eyes", both of which are great if you're into the more intense side of horror. However, "A Nightmare on Elm Street" still proves itself to be a classic horror gem.One thing about this movie that I really like is the element of fantasy in it. The concept of fantasy in a horror movie is definitely something I like to see plenty of, and here it's done with brilliance and finesse. The fact that Freddy is a dream figure pretty much means that you're not really safe anywhere, and when he attacks...watch out! The first murder highlights the intensity of Freddy, with it being the famous revolving room scene, done in all its terrifying, dizzying and ever-bloody glory. The rest of the movie is just as strong with some surreal and atmospheric scenes that underline the amazing fantasy element of the movie.Although this movie and its series has become quite mainstream for horror, it's still a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it yet, it's highly recommended, especially to fans of slasher-films or fantasy-horror films. Be sure to check it out in all it's gory, surreal, intense and heart-pumping splendor in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Following where the original started, "Saw 2" is an excellent follow-up to the smash hit that started the franchise. And like the original, this movie manages to blend its police-story crime elements with the suspense of a thriller and the tension and graphic content of horror.By now, Jigsaw is taken into custody and being interviewed by the police, all while a new group of his victims are locked in a house and must find a way out before time runs out and they meet their death. Sounds interesting, right? Well if it sounds good, seeing it will take it to another level entirely, as the dirty fingers and chipped nails on the front cover suggest.In comparison to the first "Saw", this movie is more graphic, gory and twisted. The small fire chamber, the needle pit and the wrist-cutting puzzle box all make up some gruesome scenes that really show you what a great horror movie can do. I'm sure at least one of those scenes, or others, will have you squirming! For me personally, it was the fire chamber scene that left me shuddering.Also, while the original "Saw" had a great, dirty look to it, especially something in the use of the camerawork, this one takes it up again! While the original did have a gritty, raw feel to it, as opposed to polished camerawork of say, a foreign horror film, "Saw 2" gives the original a run for its money in that field.In "Saw 2", the camerawork gets even rawer and grittier, giving it the shaky feel you may see when you're in a nightmare. There are some moments where, dare I say, it almost has a psuedo-snuff feel to it, much like the underground film series "August Underground". Dear Lord, I'll save that for another day!But anyway, "Saw 2" is still able to find a genius balance between a smart police story and a gritty torture-thriller display. I really give the writers of this film credit, because not too many films can have that dual-personality medium and pull it off so well.Well, that about wraps up this review. If you wanna watch "Saw 2", I might recommend you watch the original "Saw" before, just so you can understand what's going on. Hey, make it a double feature! Anyway, if you liked the original, or want to watch a "Saw" film, you'll love this! Thanks for the time, and peace.

With time running out before Halloween and remembering my promise to myself to write 31 horror movie reviews by the time of the 31st, I felt as though I were running low, considering how in the past I've already reviews plenty of horror movies. Then I thought, "Hhmm...I haven't done a review for Night of the Living Dead yet!". So here it is, a review of what is considered probably the most important and influential zombie movie of all time.Although it's not the first movie in the zombie-horror subgenre, ("White Zombie" beat it, being made in 1932) "Night of the Living Dead" is without a doubt, the most infleuntial zombie movie of all time, and probably the greatest one, too. Although it lacks the gore of later Romero classics such as "Dawn of the Dead" or "Day of the Dead", "Night of the Living Dead" is still a revolutionary horror film for several huge reasons.First off, having a black guy as a hero was a big step at the time, considering this movie was made in the late '60s. Romero wanted to show that with the changing times, there was no racial boundaries on who gets to be the hero in a movie. And although I'm a white guy, I like his decision a lot, because it showcases a call to revolution.Also, the movie itself is a social and political statement, about the new society, in this case, literally devouring the old one. Had the new society's devourment of the old society only been for the better this day and age...it's tough for me to be young and growing up in our culture these days! But Romero definitely had a brilliant idea with that underlying message in mind.Now, we're on to the zombies. Combining the claustrophobic atmosphere of the house and the overpowering feeling of fear and doom caused by the start of the zombie apocalypse, "Night of the Living Dead" gets everything right. Although fast zombies were to be later featured in more recent horror films, the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead" are the epitome of classic, death-paced, flesh-eating horrid fiends.I saw the movie online so I know nothing about the different DVD versions but I hear that the Millennium Edition is the best to get, so getting that one is probably the best thing. However, I did read that when purchasing any version of "Night of the Living Dead", none of the money will go to George A. Romero or any of the makers, so watching it online might be a good alternative. Any way you watch it, this is a zombie movie classic! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Starring the unforgettable Vincent Price, "House on Haunted Hill" is a classic haunted-house story, and at only 75 minutes, is short but sweet. The fact that this was also in black and white makes it even better for the atmosphere of the movie, which itself is already well-done here. Also, I'd like to mention that "House on Haunted Hill" seems to play a pretty huge influence on the slasher films that were to follow. Let's take a look at it:In "House on Haunted Hill":-There are a fairly large group of people, that....-Are in a certain amount of space together...-Are being picked off one by one...-It's at night...I know that sounds irrelevant and pointless to throw it, but I figured it fits the cliches of most slasher films.Having both described some of the aspects of the film and showing it's importance in horror movie history, the review is almost done. However, I would like to add that on the DVD I got as a present, there were many extras such as trailers and a DVD play-a-long game. I'm not sure if all versions of the DVD include these bonuses, but if not, look for the DVD with the cover that's painted and features one of the ladies staring at you.Well, that about wraps up this review. In short, "House on Haunted Hill" is a highly fun and entertaining haunted-house movie that features some great shocking moments, and should be a fun way to spend your rainy night. Here's to the month of Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Like many others, I highly anticipated the release of this album. In the latest edition of "Guitar One", guitar hero Alex Lifeson was interviewed on Rush's latest, "Snakes and Arrows". During the interview, he said that because he gets bored very easily, he wants to experiment with new tones that will inspire him. The different guitar tones, among lyrics and overall songwriting, do add different textures to "Snakes and Arrows". When I read that Rush was "going retro" on this album, I automatically pictured the "2112" album, but I guess my assumption was too obvious. However, this is a strong album altogether and should prove a nice addition to your collection.The album in general reminds me a bit of Dream Theater, which, in my opinion, is a great thing. The beautiful, two-minute, acoustic piece, "Hope", performed solely by Alex Lifeson, is a wonderful piece, and due to his performance and the DADAAD tuning makes it sound a lot like a Led Zeppelin folk instrumental. "Malignant Narcissism", the other, two-minute instrumental, sounds like sped-up Black Sabbath with some dirty, alternative-rock textures.On "Bravest Face", there's a brief, clean-blues tone that reminds me somewhat of Stevie Ray Vaughan and there's a reoccuring, yet not main, jazz riff in "Good News First" that kind of reminds me of a sped-up version of the riff in Peter Frampton's "Do You Feel Like We Do?". Neil Peart's drumming is spirited and energetic here; the music doesn't focus so much on his drumwork as earlier releases, but he proves that after all these years, he's still got talent and passion.The lyrics here are interesting, too, opposite completely to storytelling epics such as "2112" or "Hemispheres". However, they add a lot of meaning to the songs and paint a picture of what Rush is telling. The art within the booklet adds to the description behind each song, so it helps to view the pictures and read along as you listen. At least, that's what I did, and it worked quite well for me.Geddy Lee's basswork is present here, too and his voice is as vibrant and youthful as it was on Rush's debut (which, IMO, is an underrated album). Anyway, he delivers the lyrics with his signature style and it never wears thin. From the Pearl Jam-esque anthemic lyrics in "Bravest Face" to the self-assuring words in "Faithless", his voice carries Peart's words throughout.Alex Lifeson's guitar work, as I previously got started on, is probably the key element on this album. None of the songs make me automatically think of the openings on "A Passage To Bangkok" or "The Trees", but Lifeson proves right from the start that anything he can think up, he can play, and excel at doing so.The album as a whole is mystical and murky, diverse and delightful, and, at least to me, goes to show that Rush doesn't miss a trick. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I hope you can buy a copy before the stores rocket the price up to eighteen bucks (the regular amount for a new album). Anyway, thanks, Rush, can't wait to see you on tour this summer!Peace!

I remember when I got this, it was kind of at a moment's notice. However, I consider it a very lucky moment after hearing only a few seconds of this album, and listened to it all the way through the first time around. Iron Maiden is normally remembered for their Bruce Dickinson years, but if you ask me, Paul Di'anno is an excellent frontman, too. Sure, Di'anno and Dickinson may have different styles, but Di'anno's style perfectly suited Iron Maiden's early sound.Now, if you've heard at least one Maiden album before, you're probably pretty aware of their style. Their debut, "Iron Maiden" already shows a lot of their style, in addition to a bit of a more punk-metal style."Prowler" opens up with two awesome guitar riffs that harmonize together as Paul kicks out a great vocal performance to add to the sound. An energetic strutter of a song, this is a great way to kick off the album."Sanctuary" has one of the faster, more punk-styled riffs that keeps up with the fast tempo of the song. A catchy chorus is featured here, as well."Remember Tomorrow" is a slower, balladic styled song with slower guitars that offer a melody as odd but interesting as the title itself. It's songs like these that influenced Metallica's ballad-styled songs like, "One" or "Fade To Black"."Running Free": Thumping drums and a swinging bassline start this song off, which features one of the catchiest and coolest choruses on the entire album."Phantom of the Opera" is a very unique, epic-styled metal song that runs at over seven minutes. A very creative and well-written song, to say the least."Transylvania" is a great instrumental song that serves as an excellent lead into "Strange World"."Strange World" is one of the more unusual songs the band has written. It's very cool, featuring surreal lyrics and more great instrumentals. One of Steve Harris's most underrated songs around."Charlotte The Harlot" features an awesome sing-a-long chorus with pounding drums, and later on in the song turns into a very emotional ballad, before shifting to a blistering guitar solo that definitely rocks."Iron Maiden" is the three and a half minute album closer. Combining several guitar riffs, a fast tempo, and just three verses (though the last one is marked as the chorus), it is one of the most memorable songs on the album, and yet another great part of the Iron Maiden catalogue.Overall, "Iron Maiden" is an excellent album, and all songs are strong and well-written. I would definitely recommend this to all Maiden fans and metal fans in general, and even though there's no Bruce Dickinson or Dave Murray, this is definitely one of the greatest albums, and especially debuts, in heavy metal history. Merry Christmas to all! Thanks for the time, and peace.

In 1969, Led Zeppelin shook the music world up with their stunning debut album. The four guys that make up the legendary heroes of hard rock, better known as Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham are at their finest here. Robert Plant is wailing and belting out the lyrics so powerfully, Jimmy Page rips out some heavy riffs and amazing blues solos, John Paul Jones adds some thunder and psychedelic with his bass and organ work, and John Bonham rocks his drum set like there's no tomorrow. What do these nine songs show for the world of rock and roll? Read on."Good Times, Bad Times" starts things off with a bang, featuring an awesome riff, a fun sing-a-long chorus and Jimmy Page's signature pentatonic soloing, alongside John Bonham's amazing drumwork."Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You" shows the guys going in a completely different direction. Whereas "Good Times"...was a quicker hard-rocker that went under three minutes, we have an acoustic folk song that runs well over six and a half minutes. Some nice guitar melodies by Jimmy Page and great singing by Robert Plant. The chorus of the song also explodes with some heavy drumming by John Bonham. The more I listen to this song, the more I like it."You Shook Me" is the band's indulgent blues song that features John Paul Jones doing some incredible organ playing, along with John Bonham's signature drum work, and a Page/Plant vocal/guitar combo that goes along great, as always."Dazed and Confused" is one of my all-time favorite Zeppelin songs. This lengthy but amazing epic starts off with one of John Paul Jones' definitive basslines, some psychedelic guitar lines and Robert Plant howling his very soul into your ears. Suddenly, the song builds up, John Bonham plays a fast drumbeat and Jimmy Page exploded into an insane guitar solo that is one of his very best. As always, more astonishing drum fills by John Bonham, cool bass playing by John Paul Jones, and the song ends on an epic note."Your Time Is Gonna Come" once again, is a song that's the complete opposite of its previous one. Well, not complete opposite. It starts off with some nice, progressive organ playing by JPJ, then some acoustic guitar work and drums come in while Robert Plant gives us a spirited vocal performance, as always. I happen to love the chorus of this song, as it gives us a melodic, evening setting that reminds me a balladic, arena-rock sort of the chorus in a song by a band like Boston."Black Mountain Side" is an interesting guitar piece that features some cool tablas playing to accompany it."Communication Breakdown" is a fast-paced headbanger with a great guitar riff and bassline, along with Robert Plant wailing at the top of his lungs and John Bonham playing his drum set with power. Jimmy Page kicks out another outstanding guitar solo that's another of my favorites from him. A short but sweet rocker."I Can't Quit You Baby" is a more dramatic blues song with some cool licks and singing that sort of contrasts with the feel-good, fast-packed predecessor of "Communication Breakdown"."How Many More Times" is the second epic of the album, and the closer, as well. A catchy bassline and some wah-wah guitar lines start us off, then Bonham pound out some great drum work and the heavy guitar riff comes in. The song drifts in and out of a sort of surreal tone with more dreamy, psychedelic guitar lines. They give the song a very lush feel. Then Robert Plant goes into some bluesy singing that he does wonderfully, and the song rocks out until its rad end.Without a doubt, this is one of Led Zeppelin's finest albums, and one of the coolest and greatest albums in all of rock music. It has certainly become a very influential album, but no matter how many bands have written and played music in the style of Led Zep, Zeppelin is Zeppelin and has always remained the classic band they are. This album is highly recommended, and I hope you love and enjoy it as much as I do. Play it loud, too! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Dead Alive" is one of the most well-known comedy-horror crossover movies and was directed by Peter Jackson, the same guy that directed the "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy. Wow. WOW! Hard to believe a director can go from grinding up zombies with a lawnmower to six-foot elves trampling along the massive valleys near Amon Amarth (the mountain in LOTR, not the band, although the band is awesome, too!)But indeed, Peter Jackson DID direct this movie. Although it's not really horror by any means, considering all the one-liners, the slapstick humor and the gross-out gags, it's really a comedy. However, it's a comedy that probably only horror lovers would watch! The first hour or essentially plays off as a comedy without all that much gore. There are some funny moments, such as the wealthy people eating their pudding as their ears and such fall off into it! ("Rich and creamy! Just how I like it!"). We ALSO get a crazy monkey and Lionel beating the death out of a zombie baby in the middle of a park!So the first hour or so is entertaining enough, BUT make sure you have the patience to make it to the last 30 minutes, because it WILL be worth the wait! I mean, I've seen gore before, but by the time I saw the last half-hour of "Dead Alive", including the famous lawnmower massacre scene and a room full of zombies later ending up a room full of zombie blood...this movie is definitely one of the goriest movies in history. And it's funny at the same time! Peter Jackson is able to make scenes that you THINK would be gross, actually very amusing!While this movie isn't THE UTMOST goriest movie ever made, that award possibly going to Japanese action film "The Machine Girl", this movie is at the very least one of the Top 5 Goriest Movies Ever Made. If you ever wondered what slapstick humor, one-liners, 10,000 Extra Large KFC Buckets full of fake blood and a sweet romance between two young people would result in...check out "Dead Alive" for some entertainment! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Powerslave...even the name sounds legendary. Over the years, trends may have come and gone, but Iron Maiden has stood strong through it all. Even today, though they're not so mainstream, you can still see their t-shirts worn on strangers in a crowd (featuring of course, the immortal Eddie The Mascot!)If you've never heard any of Maiden's music, they sound a bit like other famous, founding power-metal bands Judas Priest and Dio. I know nobody's compared Maiden to Dio much, but I believe that Maiden, Priest and Dio were all founders of the heavy metal sub-genre known as "power metal", which, if defines, includes melodic, chugging guitars, deep basses, fast, heavy drumming and soaring vocals.However, these three were different than some of the great, yet unfortunately faceless European power-metal acts. The three power-metal titans were all somewhat mainstream so they had a bit of a different sound. Still, Iron Maiden was a revolutionary band that deserves respect and attention, and "Powerslave" is certainly one of their best, along with being one of the finest metal albums ever to grace our music stores!Believe it or not, this was actually my first Iron Maiden cd...not "Piece of Mind", nor "Number". I know what you're thinking - 'what's up with that?'. Well, while online, I heard a sample of the epic "Rime of the Ancient Mariner". I put everything I was doing on hold and felt this epic masterpiece flow through my body! It rocked! So in a few days, I picked this work of art up and can't stop listening to it. Here are the pieces that form this creation.Aces High: LOVE the opening. So melodic, yet so catchy, one of my favorite tracks. Then it starts up with a fast pace and some great vocal/instrumental work. Actually, this is a song about warplanes, bombers and things of that sort. Very interesting and a dazzling opener. Kind of like Judas Priest's "Rapid Fire", off the album "British Steel" (another fine example of power-metal!)2 Minutes To Midnight: Catchy, sing-a-long chorus with a killer guitar riff that sounds similar to the one on the classic Dio track "Stand Up and Shout".Losfer Words (Big 'Orra): An instrumental, and a flawless one at that. Seems to go by quickly, but never loses its greatness.Flash of the Blade: A mostly instrumental one with a super guitar riff. Included is a fancy, even neo-classical lick in here with a start-stop bass/drums combo similar to the opening of "Aces High".The Duelists: A similar topic to "Flash of the Blade", but longer and with more lyrics. Starts off with a quick beat of the drum and doesn't stop from there!Back in the Village: Would be considered perfect if not for the last, twenty seconds! If you're gonna listen to this CD late at night, don't listen to this track. Towards the end, the music goes on and on until you hear these creepy, pre-recorded types of sound effects, something very similar to what Pink Floyd does. Still, I admire the whole technique and how they put it in without doing it the wrong way.Powerslave: The Egyptian-tinged title track that's one of the longest songs on the album. The really catchy part of this is when a verse on the chorus repeats, "Tell me why I had to be a powerslave!". I've STILL got it in my head from the first time I listened to it.Rime of the Ancient Mariner: Worth the entire cost of the album alone! A thirteen and a half minute epic that's got anything and everything! Starts off pretty quickly, but towards the middle it slows down and even has the Captain (read the lyrics and you'll understand what I mean), narrating a part. Actually, the whole epic is, as another reviewer mentioned, about a captain and his crew out at sea. They shoot down an albatross, possibly for food, and some unexpected things happen. You absolutely MUST listen to this song!Overall: This is a fine slab of history that seems to be forgotten with today's music audience, and that's a shame. If more people today were able to recognize the talent and greatness of bands past, like Iron Maiden, among countless other classics, the world would be a little better. Even if this seems to be overlooked, it's definitely a Top 10 Metal Album. I had my doubts while buying it, but now, I can't stop listening to it! So, buy yourself a little piece of history and know you've got a timeless classic in your collection!

Pre-dating both "The Amityville Horror" and "The Shining", "Burnt Offerings" is an incredibly well-written haunted-house horror story, starring the talents of Oliver Reed, who would get fame from his star role in David Cronenberg's "The Brood" three years after this movie. The other star is Karen Black, in ironically one of the few horror roles I think she's done.Now, while "Burnt Offerings" lasts over a good hour and forty minutes, it's a gripping, brilliant and entertaining movie for several reasons. First off, it draws you in with its settings. The bright-green, comfortable forests of the summer home in California really lures you in and hypnotizes you. Then, we have the characters. Remember what they taught you in horror movie lover's school? If the villain isn't the 300-pound giant with a six-foot chainsaw (think Texas Chainsaw Pt. 2), then the horror is probably internal.OK, so I'm showing my semi-sarcastic side, but in all honesty, the second part of "Burnt Offerings"'s combo-punch is the characters. The mother, father and son all change and develop over and over, making for some interesting high/low points in the story, and a few really creepy scenes, too!Finally, characters and setting aside, this movie was really well written. I felt like the climax and escalade to it were really long, but kept me in edge-of-my-bed suspense. All the twists and turns in the plot surprised, and sometimes spooked, me.And how about the grand finale? Well, the ending makes a lot of sense and resolves the whole storyline, but honestly, left me feeling empty inside.So while I could drop a star for the gloomy ending, instead, I'll let all five stars stay, as "Burnt Offerings" was a gripping, exciting, atmospheric and visually-hypnotic horror movie. It was, as I repeat, really well-written with some really chilling scenes. If you want a haunted-house story done right, or a thrilling movie that's sure to hold your attention, "Burnt Offerings" will make you its sacrifice! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Wow, I wish I could give this 100 stars. This is one of the greatest Kiss albums I've ever listened to, alongside their other, early masterpieces. This is probably their heaviest work yet, and even with Space-Ace or Peter Criss, they do a good job.Band Members:Paul Stanley: Rhythm Guitar and VocalsGene Simmons: Bass and VocalsVincent Cusano (changed to Vinnie Vincent: replacement Lead Guitarist for a whileEric Carr: Drums. Hard-edged, heavy and skillful drums! He makes a fine replacement for Peter Criss....and a few words to describe this album are: Loud, Powerful and Fantastic.Creatures of the Night 100/100: Perfect opening, everything's great. Maybe the best song on the album.Saint and Sinner 90/100: Not as heavy, but nonetheless killer. Gene's vocals suit the song perfectly.Keep Me Comin' 91/100: A lot of people say that this is the sequel to ''Calling Dr. Love''. I think that's pretty accurate. All-around good, too.Rock and Roll Hell 93/100: Heavy bass by Gene and his vocals, nice power chords on the guitars.Danger 94/100: I'm amazed that Eric Carr, whose drumming is as heavy as can be, can do the opening drumroll as skillful as he can. Great song, heavy guitars and pounding drums.I Love It Loud 100/100: Mostly drums with a brief guitar solo, perfect party song. This is a song that definitely says KISS!!!I Still Love You 95/100: Lovely power ballad, Paul has great vocals on this. Longest song on the album, too, at over 6 minutes.Killer 100/100: Dual guitar opening with more great drumming. Lyrics are very cool, as the guitars.War Machine 100/100: Good way to close the album, another heavy track that's a great metal anthem. Gene's lead vocals, great guitars, too and interesting ending.Overall: One of the most underrated masterpiece albums of the 80s. This opened an era of 80s metal. If you want a classic KISS collection, this is very highly recommended.

Some fans might downsize the album by saying that the synthesizers and orchestral arrangements put a damper on it, but honestly, I think "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath" is a practically flawless album. Besides, plenty of great metal bands have experimented over the years. Look at Iron Maiden's spacey "Somewhere In Time". And heck, just about every Judas Priest album sounds at least a little different from the previous one. So no points lost for Black Sabbath experimenting on this album. In fact, it's one of my favorite metal albums, and I listen to A LOT of different, metal bands.Let's take a quick run-through of the songs to get an idea of what they're like, and which are the best (which is a hard thing to choose when all the songs are so great!):"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath": A sludgy, powerful guitar riff with crushing drums and Ozzy's wailing vocals about life after death are featured here. The song alternates between the catchy, sludgy section and a gentler, acoustic section that makes for a very nice touch. The shift in dynamics from heavy to soft is awesome, and shows the band progressing in their songwriting craft."National Acrobat": Musically, it's quite similar to "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath", although a great, wah-wah guitar riff is featured here, and instead of the life beyond death lyrics of the previous song, this song's lyrics focus more on the surreal adventures of a "national acrobat". Great follow-up song."Fluff": A beautiful, melodic instrumental masterpiece, featuring nice acoustic guitar work and classy piano work. A great break in dynamics make this a great, chill song."Sabbra Cadabra": One of my personal favorites off this album, this six-minute masterpiece combines early speed-metal, jazz fusion and progressive rock into one epic. The first two minutes are driven by a speedy guitar riff and some tasty soloing, not to mention a swinging drumbeat and great drum fills. We go into a spacier, more progressive sound with shimmering synthesizers and more classy piano, both instruments courtesy of Rick Wakeman of Yes. A masterpiece of a song overall."Killing Yourself To Live": Quite possibly the stand-out song of the album. We go from a driving, intro riff to a beautiful and surreal verse full of great melodies. A few sludgier, naughtier riffs are thrown in for good measure, with more great, heavy grooves and awesome soloing. Ozzy's passionate vocals are also a key element of this song, adding to the surreal then dirty, melodic then heavy appeal of this song. One of Black Sabbath's best songs ever, and one of, if not my absolute, favorite of theirs!"Who Are You?": Not a bad song at all, but odd to come right after the masterpiece of "Killing Yourself To Live". This one is very much driven by spacey, futuristic synthesizer lines, but also features a great guitar solo that rides over a piano line. This song is sludgier and spooky, and as another review stated, would be very appropriate as a theme to a laser light show."Looking For Today": Another personal favorite song of mine, this one features heavy, melodic guitar riffs and a hand-clap rhythm. Once in the middle and then towards the end, and for the rest of the song, a melodic, surreal guitar line comes in, where Ozzy sings "Looking for toda-a-a-ayyyy". Very hypnotic and lush, and the second time around, Tony breaks into a blazing guitar solo that's just as powerful as it is hypnotic and beautiful. Another work of metal art!"Spiral Architect": This six-minute epic opens with some beautiful, acoustic guitar work before going into another sludgy riff with more surreal lyrics that can still add a mystical tone to a heavy, sludgy song. This song closes out the album quite nicely, in fact!So there you have it, "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath", one of my favorite metal albums ever. I admit that the synthesizer work on "Who Are You?" and "Sabbra Cadabra" are quite indulgent, but if you don't mind that, then you should love this album as much as I do! And as a musician myself, I can say the Sabbath boys really knew what they were doing with this one. The music is complex, but simple enough to be highly memorable. It also set the stage for countless metal acts to follow, but is unique enough that it's darn-near impossible to replicate as good as the original. So is this a metal classic and an essential? Yes it is! And you're gonna love it when you hear it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Don't get me wrong, I love Aerosmith. They made some really great stuff in their prime and I can't stop listening to it. This record also shows a brief return to form. AND it marks the return of Joe Perry. However, there are a couple things on this record that bring it down slightly.Pros:-This album is dirt cheap at only eight bucks.-The classic line-up is here with their raw, rockin' blues-based material.-Every song is really good.Cons:-Production ruins some moments on this album.-Although the nine songs on here are great, the album is kinda short. And thirdly...-THEIR HEARTS JUST AREN'T IN IT!Sorry for sounding so straightforward, I just wanted to put that out there. One reason I cannot rate this album a full five stars, aside the production and no liner notes, lyrics, thank yous...etc, is the fact that they just don't seem to have any fun on this album. Back in the '70s, you could practically see Steven Tyler smile as he belted out those lyrics and gave his trademark banshee shout. You would know how much fun they are having as they "do their job". But if you take a look on the back page of the album cover, their expressions show that they didn't seem to have too much fun on this one. Songs like "Dude Looks Like a Lady" and "Love in an Elevator", from their commercial success in a few years, showed how much lighthearted Aerosmith was. However, this album just has a stiff and unflowing feel to it.If Steven Tyler could give just one "yeow! yeow! ki-ki-ki-keow!" I'd rate this higher. OTHERWISE, the whole album is great.Standout Tracks:"Let The Music Do The Talking", "Gyspy Boots", "The Hop", "Darkness"I didn't want to sound offensive to Aerosmith here, but their music should be lighthearted and loose. Anyway, for what it is, it's worth the price. Thanks for the time, and peace.

After listening to this album, I wonder why it is not considered as great a live album as it should be. Maybe it's because of the time it was released, but then again, if it were released several years earlier, it wouldn't have the same, great track selection. Anyway, this is a great album to have both for AC/DC fans and newcomers to the band. For newcomers, you get 23, excellent songs derived from every, popular album this band has enjoyed. For AC/DC fans, this can not only prove to be another, great one, but it may introduce you to some songs you might not have been familiar with (for me it was "Sin City" originally off of "Powerage", and "Who Made Who" off the album of the same name, among one or two others.)It's hard to pick favorites, as all songs are great. However, you have the one-two combination of Sin City and Who Made Who, which I found to be a high-voltage delight, plus, a few songs at over ten minutes (High Voltage, Jailbreak and Let There Be Rock, the latter of the three being the best, IMO). There's the epic "For Those About To Rock, We Salute You", complete with the cannons, the sped-up "Whole Lotta Rosie" and beautiful "Bonny". All of the songs from The Razor's Edge are better here, and the Bon Scott numbers are certainly interesting sung by Brian Johnson. The only thing is that I wish there was enough space to add songs like "Have A Drink On Me", "Shake A Leg" (which I would highly anticipate hearing live) or "Inject The Venom" (released on "For Those About To Rock"). However, the track selection here is still great and there's a lot to love.This is overall a strong and spirited album with great performances by every member of the band. However, at this point I would like to add that AC/DC's longest running drummer, Phil Rudd, is not on this album, nor The Razor's Edge. I personally prefer him over Chris Slade, as Phil added a bit more of a groove, but both guys prove to be great on the skins. If you want a generous helping of AC/DC, look for this album, among their earlier classics. Rock on!

Mastodon is a one-of-a-kind metal band, and even though "Leviathan" was only their second album, it shows even here how promising they are to become one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Combining the thrashy edge of Metallica, the sludgy grooves of Down and the progressive complexity and technicality of Rush, there's no doubt that Mastodon has a sound both great and unique, and have continued to perfect it on this album.Now honestly, at first I was about to give this album four stars instead of five, because some of the songs on the first half of the album sound fairly similar. However, when I think of all the riffs, technicality, passion, talent, and the fact that this music is an in-your-face middle finger to the sell-out bands, I know giving it less than five stars would be doing wrong.Here are some of the tracks that stand out to me the most, personally. The opening track, the hardcore mosher "Blood and Thunder", is simply addictive with its brutal riffs and shout-a-long chorus, with a huge-sounding, spoken-word breakdown towards the end and some exotic guitar harmonies in the middle. One of the best metal sounds around today. Following it up is the speed-metal "I Am Ahab", short sweet and to the point, and done in a 6/8 time signature. Brann's drums are as crazy and intense as any jazz-fusion drummer, and the riffs are as technical as Rush at their finest. "Megalodon", the first song on the second half of the album, continues with the complexity and heaviness, yet also features a nice, yet random, country-sounding riff about a minute and a half in. "Hearts Alive" is a 13-minute epic, certainly one of the songs that stands out the most, and proves that the band is great at writing progressive-metal works of art. "Joseph Merrick" is the closing song, an instrumental ballad with a lush, psychedelic vibe and a fantastic way to end a great album.So Mastodon has further improved their sound on "Blood Mountain" and "Crack The Skye", "Leviathan" still shows you that the band offers crunchy, complex music that is able to stand out from the mainstream scene and sound great. Highly recommended for fans of such aforementioned bands as Metallica, Down, Rush, etc. Buy it and split your speakers with blood and thunder! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Ignore the naysayers who criticize this album and AC/DC in general. AC/DC is one of the greatest bands in rock history. Whether you consider them blues-rock, hard rock, heavy metal, or just down-to-earth rock 'n' roll, they do it great. Don't believe me? Look at all the albums they've sold and their tremendous fan base.Anyway, back to the review...Even though I wasn't born in the '70s, it was a great time for music. Bands like Led Zeppelin, KISS, Aerosmith, Queen, Rush, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult etc. etc. etc., were achieving great success and producing great albums. AC/DC was no acception.Although such early albums like "High Voltage" and "Let There Be Rock" were hard-rockin' classics, AC/DC was never really considered a "commercial" success. And by that, I DO NOT mean a sell-out band. I just mean that their records didn't sell as well as some other bands. However, that all changed with "Highway To Hell". I read that as of May '06, "Highway..." sold more than 7 million copies. More than that, Highway To Hell was a statement. If the '70s were closing out, they were closing out with a bang."Highway To Hell" 10/10: Absolutely killer song! The heavy guitar, especially in the solo section, and the groovy, pounding drums partner with the anthemic lyrics. Great rocker with a great hook. This is the type of song that everybody can like. My mom even loves this song whenever she hears it on the radio!"Girl's Got Rhythm" 10/10: Terrific follow-up to the title track. Fantastic, blues riff and great chorus. I wouldn't be surprised if this was released as a single."Walk All Over You" 10/10: This five-minute headbanger shows AC/DC's maturity as songwriters. Love the progressive intro and the fast riff and drumbeat show just how hard these guys can rock. Awesome solos and great ending, THIS is a great song."Touch Too Much" 10/10: Very cool song with a catchy chorus and some hard-rockin' guitars/drum combo. I just love it when Bon Scott sings "She's got the body of Venus with arms."."Beating Around The Bush" 10/10: SPECTACULAR!!! I love this song, in fact, it's ones of my favorites on the album. The lyrics are funny and do a great job accompanying the rhythm that boasts a killer guitar riff."Shot Down In Flames" 8/10: Very good opener to the B-side of the album. Like I said, there are no weak tracks, but this one doesn't stand out as much as some tracks from the first half of the disc."Get It Hot" 10/10: Probably the first AC/DC song I know that's only two and a half minutes, but definitely NOT filler. The riff is simple, but catchy, and this would serve as a great song to dance to."If You Want Blood (You Got It)" 9/10: Another catchy one that just seems to be an awesome track to listen to while driving down the highway, for some reason or another."Love Hungry Man" 9/10: Once again, the lyrics really accompany the rhythm, and this is a great track about a common rock and roll topic... basically, finding a great woman by love at first sight. It's been done before, but this is something of a stand-out."Night Prowler" 10/10: Slower, almost epic song and an interesting way to close out the album. Although it's kinda dark, I heard somewhere it pokes fun at something or another. I don't really know what, but this song is, kinda obviously, something to listen to at night. Right at the end, Bon Scott quotes Mork and Mindy by saying, "Shazbot! Nanu nanu!" This was rumored to be the last take ever recorded by Scott, and the creepy thing about it is how "Shazbot! Nanu! Nanu!", was a way Mork used to end transmissions with his home planet with.Anyway, "Highway To Hell" is a classic rock album that should be in everybody's collection, especially if you love '70s music, hard rock, blues-based stuff, and of course, AC/DC! Rock on!

After getting "Back in Black" a long time ago, I decided to check out a Bon Scott-era AC/DC album. Sure enough, it was "High Voltage". While it may not be remembered as much as "BIB", "High Voltage" shows that even when an album doesn't sell ten-million plus copies, it can still be awesome. Being AC/DC's first of many albums, this can tend to not get as much airplay or critical acclaim (because Heaven knows that the critics must have been outraged hearing this in '76!). However, the music rocks and this is actually one of AC/DC's best albums."It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)": A five minute opener filled with plenty of crunchy riffs, an excellent performance by Bon, and even a bagpipe solo! (The Young brothers and Scott were from Scotland.) An awesome anthem that gets things off to a great start."Rock and Roll Singer": The riffs provide an excellent groove, one of AC/DC's finest, and Bon delivers lyrics about living the dream of being a rock star. Another great anthem!"The Jack": One of AC/DC's most immortal songs. This is a six-minute, vintage-styled blues song with so many double-entendres, it's brilliant! The whole song flows excellently, and I get a kick out of the ending!"Live Wire": According to the booklet inside the album, this song kicked off concerts for years in their early career, and one can see why. This is also the second-longest song on the album with an amazing guitar solo by Angus Young, prefiguring those of his future."TNT": Ha! Probably even people who don't listen to AC/DC (and in this day and age, virtually every rock fan does) have heard this song. Love the guitar riff, it has a great groove, and you can tell Bon Scott had a blast singing them lyrics! An AC/DC staple even thirty years later, this is good-time rock and roll!"Can I Sit Next To You, Girl": This song has an old-fashioned swing to it that gives a unique touch to the album. A cool song, this makes me think of what it must have been like going to a high-school dance in AC/DC's time."Little Lover": Another blues-styled rocker very similar to "The Jack", but the lyrics are less double-entendre styled and more of those "I'm so in love with my lady!" lyrics, which make for a nice image, coming from Bon Scott's one-of-a-kind delivery."She's Got Balls": Such a title would bring up very strange confusion, and hearing them is another. Imagine hearing a twenty-year-old guy with shoulder-length hair and arm tattoos wailing, "The lady's got balls!/ She's got BA-A-ALLS!". Nevertheless, another great groove-rocker."High Voltage": More lyrics about being an independent and free rocker, you gotta love it! The riff is great, too, and sounds a bit like T. Rex's "Bang A Gong, Get It On" riff. Actually, I read that Malcolm Young was a fan of the band, so that makes perfect sense. An excellent way to close the album.Overall:"Rolling Stone" magazine said this was an "all-time low" in hard rock history when it first came out. Now, it's sold more than 3 million in the U.S. alone, and still boasts a handful of AC/DC classics! After having listened to this album for a long time, those critics couldn't be further from the truth! Anyway, the remastering on this album is excellent, the raw tone of the guitars is great, and this is an album that is sure to keep you interested. The only thing I would like to point out is that, compared to later albums, the remastering of the drums on this album is terrible! Hearing it on "It's A Long Way...", compared to songs such as "For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)", or countless others, it could have used more work!Anyway, with all things said and done, this is a great debut album from five guys that know rock and roll! If you like AC/DC, you're gonna love this album! Thanks for the time, catch ya later!

I can't really think of anything too specific to say about "Back in Black". One day, I bought the album, listened to it and had one of the biggest musical joyrides I can recall! Critics may despise AC/DC, but that's no reason to neglect this album! In fact, this qualifies not only as being one of the biggest-selling rock albums of all time, but one of the greatest. That being said, "Back in Black" is probably the first album people will think about whenever AC/DC is mentioned, and while they have a great selection in their catalogue, this is, no doubt, their finest hour.From the guitar crunch of the Young brothers, from Malcolm's rock-solid rhythm playing to Angus's legendary riffs, licks and solos, this no doubt qualifies as a great guitar album. Then comes in the rhythm section of Cliff Williams on bass and Phil Rudd on drums, and while Phil Rudd may not have the same chops as John Bonham, Phil still makes his drums sound larger than life, which makes for a great cornerstone of the AC/DC groove. And then...Brian Johnson. Who would have thought after such a great lead singer as Bon Scott passed away, Brian Johnson would be able to fill in his role, and fill it in greatly, as well. His voice may take some getting used to, but he definitely sounds best on this album.In addition, the remastering is excellent. The volume is up and there's no static or unneccesary noise that ruins the sound. After all, there's nothing as disappointing as hearing a great song like it was recorded a mile away! Anyway, this album is just flat-out excellent for those who dig such a sound. Ten songs at a little over forty minutes, and a cross between a hard-rock crunch and an old-school groove for each song, AC/DC did just about everything they could right on this album.As a summary, this album will make you forget your problems, imagine these guys on stage at night in a big, sold-out arena, playing these rockers loudly and proudly, and, of course, prove to be a testament of time and rock and roll. And remember, take no pressure from the critics. Be your own person! Rock out and feel good about it! And remember, "rock and roll ain't noise pollution...it just makes good, good sense!" Peace!

"Children of the Corn" is one of those movies that leaves a connection with you after you've seen it. I remember when I was 11 or 12 and this movie was on TV, right in the beginning in the coffee house massacre scene. I remember being so frightened I had to switch channels! Being older, I can say that the movie's not as terrifying now, but "Children of the Corn" still has an eerie atmosphere that entices you all the way through.If you can get past what may seem silly aspects that climax towards then end and enjoy the movie nonetheless, then "Children of the Corn" will definitely be a great watch. It's one of those '80s classics that's still just as entertaining, eerie, mystical and captivating now as it was in its own time. The setting in the abandoned, little Midwestern town is the perfect setting for this sort of movie, so that beefs up the quality of the film right there. In addition, the acting is quite good, and Isaac is one of the most sinister little punks I've ever seen on screen! Malachai too, plays an awesome villain, but whereas Isaac plays the darker, more evil villain, Malachai plays the more nuts-out, kick-a## sort of villain. The two of them work great together and lead the evil flock of children...gahh, it's starting to take its effect on me again!Although "Children of the Corn" doesn't really have the humorous breaks in it that a lot of other horror movies do, it's certainly a great and enjoyable movie, that's most likely to captivate you with its dark, mysterious atmosphere. Pick this up in time for Halloween, too, to give yourself an extra reason to be scared and to love this time of year! Thanks for the time, and peace.

If you couldn't tell by the gratuitous gore on the album cover or the horrendously shocking song titles ("Necropedophile", "Post Mortal Ejaculation" "Entrails Ripped..."), this is a death metal album of the most insane, brutal, sickest, energetic kind. Cannibal Corpse has never released a bad album in their entire history, in my opinion, but if you asked me what album really exposed them to a lot more than just the underground community, "Tomb of the Mutilated" would by my answer.On the "Centuries of Torment" DVD, which is absolutely amazing by the way, the band discusses how this was their first album to be censored and refused to be stocked in certain stores. Well if that doesn't say controversy then I don't know what does! Either way, this is an incredible album and even in today's environment of an infinite amount of bands getting heavier and heavier, this album can stand with the most brutal of them.The band puts out some of their best material on this album: Riff-oriented, breakneck speed, gutteral growling, headbanging-worthy, spine-tingling bass guitar work, the works. I type the descriptive elements of the album in this format because I feel it suits the album: a splatter of gory metal that has no rulebook that needs to be followed, and it never sounded better. With such masterpieces as "Hammer Smashed Face", "I C*m Blood" and "Beyond The Cemetery", this is old-school death metal at its finest.Also, to any haters out there that think death metal is just a bunch of simplistic dribble, look up the tabs for any of these songs. I have been a musician since I was eight years old and I still think these songs are pretty challenging to learn the first time around! So great musicianship is present on this album, without a doubt.In short, this is one of the definitive releases in gory, relentless, brutal death metal. It's a joy and a treat for all lovers of such a style, and it proves that all these years later a band can be just as intense as one can imagine. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

There really isn't much that needs to be said. Cannibal Corpse is one of the most notorious death metal bands of all time and have risen to great heights doing what they do best. "Eaten Back To Life" is a testament to the extremities in metal. Bob Rusay and Jack Owen have such an awesome guitar tone on this album, and that tone helps to bring out crushing riff after crushing riff, technical lick after technical lick, and some very awesome solos. Paul is also one of the greatest metal drummers of all time, bar none. Alex Webster is a musical genius, and even here, early on, he shows his budding skills as a songwriter that will eventually reach insane amounts. And last but not least, the ever-famous Chris Barnes. Say what you will about the man, but if there's one thing we should all agree on, he is a fantastic death metal vocalist, and he proves it to you over and over on this album.From the longer, more progressive songs such as the opener and closer "Shredded Humans" and "Buried in the Backyard", the band shows you just how extreme and intense they can be. Then we have such shorter but still amazing headbangers such as "Rotting Head", "The Undead Will Feast" and one of my personal favorites "A Skull Full of Maggots". Riff after riff, growl after growl, these guys were at the top of their game from the getgo. In addition, this set new boundaries of heaviness and new realms for metal music to go into. "Eaten Back To Life" comes highly recommended to the fan of underground music, because, like B-movie foreign zombie films, "Eaten Back To Life" is the sort of glorious low-budget entertainment that satisfies the most primal in us all! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Sure, it's only four songs and only seventeen minutes long, but "Haunting The Chapel" was a preview of things yet to come from Slayer. I find this EP very enjoyable because it comes the best of both aspects of Slayer that I love. This release has the dark, mystical, evil atmosphere of "Show No Mercy" and "Hell Awaits", but it also has the bludgeoning and hellish sounds that were to come on "Reign in Blood", "South of Heaven" and "Seasons in the Abyss". The most well-known song here would, of course, be the six-minute epic, the opening headbanger "Chemical Warfare", but the other three songs also prove to be worthy Slayer songs, with a relentless mixture of madman drumming, demonic guitar work ranging from evil-sounding, technical riffs to blistering solos. And of course, the bunch is rounded off with Tom's deep bass-guitar work and classic, evil vocals. A great landmark in thrash metal, this is highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Slayer's first album "Show No Mercy" shows the band as being very promising right from the getgo. Fast, evil riffs mixed with near-anarchic drumming, Tom's signature vocals, dark and horror-inspired lyrics and chaotic guitar solos. Although Slayer was known more for the sound they came up with during "Reign In Blood", I really love the sound of this album and their next one, "Hell Awaits". Both of these albums showcase an early black metal/ death metal style mixed with the band's Bay Area thrash sound. I don't know why they didn't write more material like this, but I am glad to have the amount of material in this style they already put down."Evil Has No boundaries" reminds me of a Slayer-styled "Hit the Lights", the first song on Metallica's "Kill 'Em All". This song is fast, evil, energetic, and a lot of fun; it's the kind of song that you want to blast while going crazy fast in your car on a Friday night. "The Antichrist" has an awesome, pentatonic riff and some of Tom's most sinister vocals on the album. "Crionics" is a personal favorite of mine by the band, and is quite unique: melodic, galloping riffs, sci-fi lyrics, and a very progressive songwriting style, a great song to play at night. "The Final Command" kicks off with a fast and smooth riff that's as catchy as it is dark, before the rest of the song explodes in with the classic Slayer energy. "Show No Mercy" kicks off with some great drumming by the legendary Dave Lombardo before the rest of the band comes in and rounds off this classic album, going out with a bang. The rest of the album is, of course, incredible as well.Overall, this might be my personal favorite Slayer album, it's a bunch of dark, evil, horror-inspired thrash-metal fun. Be sure to get it and crank it loud! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Cannibal Corpse is a balls-out band, and we all know that. They are the most famous death metal band and certainly one of, if not the most notorious for being so lyrically controversial. Therefore, they have a pretty big image to fulfill to newcomers of their music. Fortunately, these guys never disappoint, and "The Bleeding" is another great release by these guys, along with being of the best brutal-death metal albums around. This is a pretty historic album, too, as it is the last CC album recorded with Chris Barnes. So what do I have to say about "The Bleeding"? Read on to find out.As always, Cannibal Corpse play their songs loud, hard and fast. Alex and Paul are one of the greatest rhythm sections in extreme metal. However, what makes this album special is the fact that it started to bring more of a groove into the band's sound. Instead of just playing blast-beat driven 1,000 miles per hour songs, the band adds catchy grooves, somewhat similar to Pantera in a few parts. The talent also never ceases, as the band proves themselves to be possessors of quite some talent."Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead" is one of the band's all around best songs; the songwriting, the riffs, the lyrics, all are strong pointed. "F-ed With A Knife" is very thrashy and cool, with energetic guitar riffs and Chris doing some of his sickest vocals around. "Stripped, Raped and Strangled", one of the signature songs off this album, features a very catchy groove, some awesome guitar riffs, and notorious lyrics. "The Pick-Axe Murders" has lots of great, technical riffs, a chaotic guitar solo, and some very humorous lyrics. "She Was Asking For It" is also a very energetic musically, and features some of the band's best lyrics.Overall, this album is a great slab of death metal, highly recommended to all fans. The great thing about this album is that the band proves to be one of the utmost greatest brutal bands out there, while still being able to make catchy songs, well, for this genre at the very least! Once again, highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Reise, Reise" is one of the most solid foreign metal albums of recent years. With a bludgeoning, industrial-metal sound, spacey and haunting keyboards and Till's ever-famous voice, a voice that is quite likely nothing short of a human Terminator, this album surely delivers! Not only is the music great, powerful, majestic, dark and melodic all at the same time, but it's also educational; all of the lyrics are sung in German, so if you're wanting to learn a new language and you love this band, German might just be the foreign language for you. Anyway, on to my favorite/ the standout tracks of this album."Reise, Reise" - A slow, powerful, epic and majestic song with a great sing-a-long chorus, or rather declare-a-long, as Till's strong, matter-of-fact vocals imply. Great way to open the album, with some beautiful accordian music thrown at the end. Awesome song!"Mein Teil" - This one might spook you after the calm ending of "Reise, Reise"! A sledgehammer riff gets cranked out of the amps for this one, with verses that slowly build up to a monstrous chorus. Excellent songwriting here, with some very creepy lyrics for a creepy atmosphere. A classic, nothing sort of it."Dalai Lama" - At first I didn't remember this song too much, but then I grew to love it a lot. The sinister, intro riff is similar to Black Sabbath, then comes in the steady beat, rhythmic lyrics, and an all-around great song. Some nice piano work is featured along with some darkly mystical singing."Keine Lust" - An uptempo song, one that's fast especially for Rammstein, but with a great start-stop rhythm as Till belts out "Ich hab keine lust!""Los" - An unexpected treat, this song features acoustic guitars, still downtuned to C, but are very nice nonetheless. I like this track a lot because it's another song that shows Rammstein musically branching out, which is always a good thing to do."Amerika" - If any song deserves to be called the fist-pumping sing-a-long song that SHOULD become a big hit, this one does. A nice arpeggiated keyboard solo in the middle of the song, followed by an angry, guitar-driven short section. The song is also a commentary on American society; now I'm no fascist against my own country, but in today's times, people can most certainly criticize the general America all they want in my eyes. Anyway, onwards..."Morgenstern" - Translates to "morning star", very poetic indeed! What I love about this song is the chorus, where Till uses an almost operatic voice. A very nice touch, adding even more variety to the album."Stein Um Stein" - A slower and powerful song that features some great yelling by Till, although it is unintentionally comical the way he does it at the very end of the song. Either way, a very good song.Well, there's really nothing to complain about here; aside maybe a lack of guitar solos if you want that (and I tend to love indulgent guitar solos in songs, for that matter). But either way, this album most certainly deserves five stars and a place in every metal fan's library. For anybody interested in this style of music, Rammstein will definitely not disappoint. Get this and see why Rammstein is as loved as they are. Yet another reason for me to be proud of the German side of my heritage. Either way, very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

The French are well-known for making great horror films such as "Inside" and "High Tension.". However, "Dead End", also from French directors, is a different affair altogether. Weaving together dark and yet hilarious humor with supernatural horror, "Dead End" will take you in a ride into darkness. The movie stars a family on the way to their relatives for Christmas, and are traveling alone in the dark. Classic isolation? Check. Although the film can generally be considered a supernatural horror movie, the film generally doesn't utilize a tremendous supply of special effects. A lot of the terror is based around the characters, the situation and the surroundings, all of which get more tightly knit as the movie progresses. Things get creepier and creepier with a mysterious lady and her dead baby, the family getting picked off one by one, and a mysterious car that appears after a death.I've always said a lot about the movie so I don't want to say much more. However, I will say that the ending twist was excellent; brilliantly done and it made a lot of sense, unlike some horror movies that seem to try to force an ending. Altogether, there isn't all that much gore in this movie, but the acting, script and atmosphere are all excellent. This is definitely the type of film to watch alone at night, so enjoy! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Night of the Demons 2" brilliantly blends gory, supernatural terror with slapstick comedy for an uproarious knee-slapper of a great film. If you enjoyed the first movie, I'm pretty sure you're gonna love this one too. Also featuring Angela from the first one, this features more great chills and laughs at Hull House. Despite the pacing being a bit slow in some parts, there's so much great stuff to love about this film, it's impossible for me not to give it five stars. We have a bunch of babes bound up in this private Catholic boarding school, a rebellious young schemer that looks like Jason Newsted in his glory days with Metallica, a bunch of gore, some fascinating religious themes tied in. What else? Oh yeah, we have a hot demon girl cage-dancing to Morbid Angel (a fantastic death metal band) at said Catholic boarding school's Halloween party! For those of you that like slapstick comedy, witty one-liners, bloodsoaked horror and supernatural terror, this is the movie for you! Thanks for the time, anad peace.

"Seinfeld Seasons 1 and 2" shows us the beginning of one of the greatest shows of all time. In this collection, we get the entire first and second season, alongside hours of extra features. Although I personally felt that they defined themselves by the third season, the first two contain some great episodes, as well."Male Unbonding" takes the hilarious true-to-life concept of having a "friend" that's obsessed with Jerry, yet Jerry doesn't want to be with him, so he makes up excuses that become more and more ridiculous. It also holds the honor of being the only episode that doesn't begin with "The"."The Statue" contains the first scene that really defines Kramer's character, where he goes undercover as a cop in order to get Jerry's statue back. ("Keep makin' love to that wall, pervert!")"The Heart Attack" features George at his funniest, as they go to a holistic healer who, judging by his persona and house, is somebody only Kramer could know! The episode includes a hysterically funny ambulence scene towards the end, definitely one to watch."The Chinese Restaurant" is a classic example of making an entire show out of practically nothing; in this case, waiting around for a seat at a Chinese restaurant. This is a first-rate example of how Seinfeld was always good at taking a minimalistic idea and stretching it into something interesting."The Busboy" is an interesting episode because it ends with the two stories meeting up at the end, something that would be done in plenty of future episodes. It was also quite funny to see Kramer as clumsy as he was in the busboy's apartment, that's our Kramer!For those who don't own this but want a dosage of Seinfeld, this comes very highly recommended, equally so for those wanting to get into the Seinfeld series. With over 20 episodes, over 13 hours of extra features, including deleted scenes and inside looks on the episodes (something I really love) and a few hidden "Easter Egg" special features, this collection is sure to satisfy! Pick it up as soon as possible. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although I've owned "Appetite for Destruction" for quite some time, I never, really considered reviewing it. However, since it celebrated its 20th anniversary on July 21st, I guess now would be an appropriate time to bring it up.Even though AfD is a great album, it actually took some time to really grow on me. However, between Axl Rose's banshee vocals, Slash's crazy guitar work and the rest of the band playing their hearts out, it's easy to see that, when combined with such excellent songs, this album made an impression on American musical culture. What with the famous album cover and an amount of underlying drug references, little things only add up for this stunningly impressive, late '80s album.Starting off with "Welcome to the Jungle" we heard a guitar riff that combines the sleazy guitar tone of Ratt with the brute force of, say, a much heavier band like Megadeth. And with the opening chord sounding like part of the National Anthem (IMO, at least), the jungle-percussion section midway through, and Axl's definitive cry, "You know where you are? You're in the jungle, baby! You're gonna die!", it's easy to see how such an awesome riff-rocker solidified itself among countless, other legendary songs of the time. 10/10"It's So Easy" starts off with a bassline and some no-frills snare drumming. The haunting guitar riff compliments Axl's voice, which, in this song, has a deeper, more Mick Jagger-esque sound. And with the catchy verses and nightmarishly nihilistic lyrics, this song definitely fills in the boots of "Welcome to the Jungle". 10/10"Nightrain" is a song whose adventurous lyrics stand as a double-entendre for drugs. Axl's voice is back up in the higher register as Slash wails his heart out on the pentatonic scales on his guitar. And as a matter of fact, this song is ideal to play in the night time. 10/10"Out Ta Get Me" sort of reminds me of a musical version of "The Outsiders". Unfortunately, the song doesn't do it for me, as I don't ever seem to want to listen to it. 7/10"Mr. Brownstone" has another drug references, but the music and the humor mask it enough that it doesn't really bother you. The salsa section used twice in here is a great moment for me, the guitar solo rocks, and the ending of the song is fun, as well. 10/10"Paradise City" ends the first half of the disc as a six and a half minute epic in the vein of "Free Bird" and "Stairway To Heaven". Everybody is at the top of their game here, Axl giving some of his most powerful and spirited vocal work on the entire album, Slash shredding out one of the greatest guitar solos of all time, and Duff McKagan throwing in some nice bass work at the right time. What a classic this song is. 10/10"My Michelle" is the complete opposite of the anthemic epic that was before it; Between the progressive, opening guitar work and the speedy choruses, Axl sings about dating a girl who lives a sterotypical hard life. Actually, the ending kind of reminds me of something that could be said in a movie. Although it's not the definitive song on the album, it's another, solid track. 8/10"Think About You" is a beautiful song, a "half-ballad" as I would say, for it contains balladic lyrics with a rocking beat. The acoustic guitars in the chorus complement the electric ones, however, the ending seems to come out of nowhere. Nevertheless, a great song. 10/10"Sweet Child o' Mine" was voted as one of the ten best songs of its decade, so that alone should give you some insight that it's a great song. The legendary guitar riff, which sounds like a melodic alarm, starts this six-minute love song off, which boasts some of Axl's most poetic lyrics around. The lengthy guitar solo is another bit of history you're going to love, and the repetition of "Where do we go now?", only adds to the beauty of the song. A true classic. 10/10"You're Crazy" is a fast and furious song about staying away from that girl that only "wants you for your body", which Axl describes as being "CRAZY! oh my...". A good song to thrash around to, yet it keeps the melody a lot of the songs have. 10/10"Anything Goes" a fun song that has plenty of double-entendres, sounds like somebody combined AC/DC with Alice Cooper. I love the swing section at the end, which displays some of Steven Adler's drumwork. 10/10"Rocket Queen" is a lengthy, darker song at over six minutes. The last verse is based a lot on being friends with somebody, however, even with that and the fact that this is the last song on the album, "Rocket Queen" doesn't seem as introspective as you might think. Still, a great way to close the album. 9/10There you have it, my review for "Appetite for Destruction". In my opinion, and in the opinions of many others, it's considered one of the absolute best albums of the '80s, up there with AC/DC's "Back in Black", U2's "The Joshua Tree" and Prince's "Purple Rain". A relentless burst of guitar solos, Axl's legendary vocal work, and an overall vibe that's very different than later songs such as "November Rain" or "Don't Cry" makes Appetite For Destruction a five-star album in my book. Even if Axl's neck-deep in feuds with countless other, famous figures, the music itself is more than fine, and hopefully makes a great addition to your music library. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins" is a great monster movie, and a unique chapter in the Tremors series. What's notable about this movie is, for one, that it's shot in black and white. Considering it's a modern day horror film, not even ten years old, seeing this technique puts an interesting spin on things. It also takes place in the 1800s, and with that being said, I think the black-and-white filming adds to the feeling, considering the time the movie takes place in. It's also interesting to see the culture of things back then, and how people of that time handle the monstrous Graboids attack, in comparison to how they were handled in the modern day and age of the first three "Tremors" movies. Overall, and interesting and noteworthy addition to the "Tremors" series, and one definitely worth checking out. I highly recommend getting the "Tremors 4-Pack", because that gives you all 4 of the movies and their extra features on two discs at a great price. Oh yeah, and an early Happy Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Lucio Fulci's "Zombie" is generally regarded as his best film, and is definitely a film of his that put him in the horror mainstream. In addition, this is sort of Fulci's tribute to "Dawn of the Dead", because in Italy, "Dawn..." was called "Zombi", and Zombie was then called "Zombi 2" to build off the success of "Dawn...".Well, is Zombie a worthy tribute to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead? Here are my POSITIVES and NEGATIVES about Zombie:POSITIVES:- The infamous eyeball scene, which will make you SQUIRM and GASP.- Two throat-biting scenes, which are SOAKED in blood!- The glorious, inevitable topless skin diving, and a shower scene where said showering girl gets the lovely eyeball piercing.- Throwing flaming Molitovs are the zombies! I know as well you know, that's just AWESOME!- Then, there's the legendary SHARK VS. ZOMBIE SCENE. Yes, as soon as said topless skin diver escapes, the attacking zombie and a shark that's followed the diver PITCH UNDERWATER COMBAT. Biting and grabbing ensured, this epic brawl features some dazzling underwater scenery and an awesome synthesizer soundtrack.- An ending that makes you go OH SNAP!Now for the NEGATIVES:- Until they reach the island, there isn't much of a plot here. Admitedly, the scenes in between all have some level of interesting, but I would've liked a little more texture in the movie.- For a while, the pace is slow. Even with the highlights this movie has, this movie certainly doesn't move as fast as it could have.- CHARACTERS. The characters remain pretty static. I know there are some characters that are supposed to stay the same in movies and books, but most here didn't do anything too crazy or out of character.- THE GORE LEVEL. The back of the DVD includes praise stating, "As gory as the law allows it...", haha, no no NO my friend, DEAD ALIVE is as gory as the law allows. Now, ZOMBIE has some cool gore scenes, but it's not as gory another Fulci classic, "City of the Living Dead". But I WILL say that ZOMBIE is about as bloody as a typical Italian horror classic.THE GATES THAT CLOSE THIS REVIEW:For a B-movie, ZOMBIE definitely has the meat and potatoes of a good horror movie, and it CERTAINLY beats out most of the 20 plus horror movie remakes made since 2000, but I HONESTLY felt that it was overrated. If you like B-movies and zombie movies, this one might work, but if neither of those horror sub-genres are your cup of tea, think about it a bit before you see it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I don't know what it is about this album, but even with each repeated listen to it, I can't get enough. I've had "Catalyst" ever since it came out in 2004 and have listened to it a lot when I first got it and for two years or so. Then came a period where I only listened to it occasionally. However, within the past, couple of months I've dug this CD out and once again listened the heck outta it.Now that I look back, and regardless of how long it may take one to realize, this is a great release by New Found Glory that proves awesome even after repeated listens. Here's a run through of some of the songs to give you a preview:"Intro": A 36-second intro, showing the band playing at a very fast tempo with blasting guitars and anthemic lyrics. More in the melodic hardcore subgenre instead of the pop-punk subgenre, but a great way to kick off the album."All Downhill From Here": Probably most people have at least heard OF this song, but I'm sure most people will recognize the melody once they hear it. Thick, catchy riffs and a sing-a-long chorus make this one of my favorites and one of the catchiest off the album."This Disaster": A heavier, slower and even more melodic song than "All Downhill From Here". This one shows the band writing matured, relationship-based lyrics and accompanying them to hypnotic guitar lines, a catchy hook and an awesome chorus."Truth of My Youth": Not as heavy as "This Disaster" but faster and more energetic. Well-developed lyrics about reminiscing one's younger days, and great drum fills. This song has more of a modernized garage-rock sound to it."I Don't Wanna Know": A more acoustic-based ballad that goes towards a power ballad towards the end. Very sweet lyrics, a sing-a-long, almost nursery-rhyme sounding chorus, and some arena-rock styled guitar chords thrown in towards the end. A truly great ballad."Your Biggest Mistake": Because of the fast tempo and the rollicking guitar riffs in this song, it may sound a little goofier, but this is a great blast of riff-driven, heavy-drumming, sing-a-long energy."Doubt Full": A heavy and melodic guitar line open, with a slower verse in 6/8, giving the song a bit of a slower feel as if being on a boat in the waves. The lyrics are also very interesting, with lines such as "This letter explains everything/ The content is the truth/ Each letter could cut like daggers/ If I decide to finally give it to you"."Failure's Not Flattering": Despite the negative-sounding song title, this song has a very poppy, catchy hook, melodic '80s sounding keyboards in the chorus, muted guitar riffs in the verse, and is overall very catchy and even empowering, with lyrics such as "Don't leave this rock unturned/ Because you might like what you find/ A sureshot hit with your name attached to it/ Will you keep me in mind?"."I'd Kill To Fall Asleep": Once again, the band shows us their crossover style of melodic hardcore and pop-punk with huge, blasting guitar riffs with a lot of melody, and a very hypnotic, seductive-sounding chorus. The balladic-breakdown is also adds a very nice, late-night touch. Awesome song all around!"No News Is Good News": A commentary on today's world and how all that seems to be on the news is negative, this one's a little softer than the previous track. Melodic guitar lines in D major with a laid-back drum beat in the chorus, then we kick into a garage-rock styled chorus. Overall a very listenable and loveable song, it makes for a great cruising song at sundown on the highway!Well as you can see I definitely love this album. There's lots of great songs that I've listened to repeatedly, and haven't gotten tired of. This is one of the few albums that I've listened to more times that I can think of. With "Catalyst", New Found Glory shows that they can combine the intensity of melodic hardcore with the catchiness of pop-punk and throw some great music your way. This album seemed to be a big influence on such more recent bands as Escape The Fate and A Day To Remember, both great bands in my opinion. Well that about sums up this review, but if you want an awesome album that hopefully you'll listen to at least almost as much as I do, get this! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Amidst the hard-to-find horror films of the '80s that haven't made it to DVD or are streamed in their entirety on video sites such as Youtube, "The Mutilator" stands at the top of the hill as one of the best forgotten slasher films of its era. A group of college friends go to take care of the lead guy's dad's house on the shoreline in the South (I believe Georgia?). Here's a first, even for slasher films: The killer is the lead guy's Dad, and this is shown to us right from when they arrive. The lead guy accidentally shot his mother when he was 10 and now his father is out for revenge on his son and the friends he brought along... pretty sick and twisted, huh! It's like Cronos decided to star in a slasher film. Well, the movie is very entertaining, the dialogue is the classic "so cheesy it'll make you smile" sort of affair, and there are some pretty great gore shots throughout the movie! Also, not to give away any spoilers, but something rather rare for a slasher film, this one has a happy ending which earns big points for me. Hard-to-find but this is a great film for fans of slashers and horror in general. Thanks for the time and peace.

All right, I know that some people aren't going to like this movie, but as of me: I LOVE SUSPIRIA!!!!! Just wanted to make that clear, heh.-Now, I will admit that in between the murders, the pace can slow down a bit. But if you're a horror lover or a gorehound, you NEED to see this movie, if only for the kills! Watch in the first where the girl that runs away from the ballet school gets absolutely SAVAGED! It's no wonder Entertainment Weekly referred to it as "the most vicious murder in a horror movie".-The supernatural feel, surreal images and tone, amazing color and unfamiliar setting are absolutely beautiful. This has got to be the most beautiful and mesmerizing display of shocking horror cinematography ever. The foreign setting definitely helps, and captivates the viewer, especially if they're looking for a movie that's just as atmospheric and supernatural as it is bone-chillingly terrifying. So surreal and astounding...LOVE IT!-I found the two-disc version at a very reasonable price, and this is, of course, after I saw it four times before owning it!SUMMARY:THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE. IT ISN'T THE MOST FAST-PACED MOVIE EVER AND IT MAY SEEM TO RUN A LITTLE LONG. BUT IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE, WANT SOMETHNG HORRIFYING, VICIOUS, BEAUTIFUL, SURREAL, GENIUS AND GROUNDBREAKING, SUSPIRIA MAY BE AS GREAT A MOVIE TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME.So as you can tell I think this movie rocks! Just watch it with an open mind, be patient, and expect the hardcore horror mastery via Italian director Dario Argento. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Hellraiser", directed by Clive Barker, is an amazing sort of fantasy/monster-horror crossover movie that has the creativity and professionally written touch to both:A: Make its own set of rules, and B: Not only abide by them, but still prove to be a twisted movie!So, if you probably know the plot by now but haven't seen the movie, I'll convince you as to why this movie is so incredibly awesome:First off, "Hellraiser" is a movie that is able to pull off having quite a few characters. There's Julia and Frank, who, although are deemed the "protagonists" are in the end, obviously the villains. We have Kirsti, played by the gorgeous Ashley Laurence, the type of jailbait only Motorhead would sing about (I can't believe I just said that!), and Kirsti is also a protagonist, though, we can tell that she stays good and doesn't cross over to being an actual villian.And then we have the Cenobites! Pinhead, the sadomaschocistic (sp?) leader, Butterball as I call the heavy-set one, the Chatterer, one bad fella who proves it when he sticks his fingers down Kirsti's throat, and Fembot, as I call the Cenobite that's female with the pale face and shadowed eyes.OK, so obviously all the characters are dazzling, but what makes this movie even better is how there's so many twists! When Frank opens the puzzle box, he is supposedly dead, but when a mover cuts his hand on a nail and spills blood on the floor, Frank gets resurrected as a deformed corpse...hey, that's the supernatural for ya.Frank and Julia used to be lovers, and the only way for Julia to restore Frank to his fully human form is to bring people to their attic and kill 'em, then their blood will spill so Frank can absorb it and become fully human.This is also all the responsibility of the puzzle box that contains Pinhead and the Gang, and that comes into play about an hour in. Kirsti, now the only protagonist that's still good, opens the box, and, yes, does set Pinhead and the Wild Ones free. If there's another thing to know about "Hellraiser", is that it's a movie with GREAT monsters! Pinhead can even control chains all with his head, baby!But the ingenious factor of "Hellraiser" is how sadistic it becomes. How far Julia is willing to go to give Frank rebirth? How many people must she kill to have her lover return from being but a bloody corpse? What's gonna happen to Kirsti, the innocent heroine, throughout all of this? And what are Pinhead and the Cenobites gonna do?The answers lie within the movie. Within these 90 minutes of sex and violence lie true intellect, so many props go to Clive Barker. The good guys, the bad guys, the monsters, the sublime sort of pain each character seems to be in (as Robert Englund said on the 100 Scariest Movie Moments countdown), the gore, the plot, EVERYTHING about Hellraiser that I thought was good, was GOOD! This is a movie that, if you rent it for the weekend, you WILL watch it twice!And since that was the case with me, "Hellraiser" now holds a high and mighty spot on my "Horror Movies To Buy" list. WATCH THIS! If you like fantasy horror, if you like scary movies with good monsters, if you wanna watch a movie with lots of depth, twists and style, "Hellraiser" will make your night! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I don't know why I didn't review this album a long time ago. Jimi Hendrix is one of the greatest artists in rock music, and the greatest guitarist of all time. He wasn't the fastest, but his music revolutionized so much music, and in the small amount of time he was around, as well. "Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix" is an essential piece of rock and roll. It's very accessable, literally in every store I've been in, and it only goes for ten dollars.On this 20-song compilation, you get such popular tracks as "Purple Haze", "Fire", and Jimi's highest-charter, the timeless, Bob Dylan cover "All Along The Watchtower". Of course, Jimi was influenced by a variety of music, as he shows in the incredible blues stylings of "Red House" and "Voodoo Child (Slight Return"). You have such trippy songs as the soul-influenced "Crosstown Traffic", a personal favorite, the somewhat-dirty and ever-groovy "Foxey Lady", the brilliant masterpiece, "If 6 Was 9" and the "it's-so-trippy-I-don't-know-what-to-say" work of art that is "Bold As Love". Then there's the eternal beauty of "Little Wing", the funky, post-humous, "Dolly Dagger" and his immortal genius of the Woodstock recording of "Star Spangled Banner". Of course, there are more than that, but this just goes to show what a musician Jimi Hendrix was!All in all, an excellent collection that should belong in every classic rock fan's library. After this, you might wanna check out "Band of Gypsys", as it shows Jimi's stunning live work. Although artists like Jimi Hendrix, Cream and Led Zeppelin may stir controversy, I always believe that it's what you personally think of the music. And I, for one, believe Jimi Hendrix's music is timeless, awesome and extremely influential. Hope you all love this one, peace!

Well, like another reviewer thought, I thought it would be cool to review "Friday the 13th" on...Friday the 13th! If you're a horror movie fan, there's a good chance you've already seen this at least once, but if you haven't, well you're in for a treat!"Friday the 13th" is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The forest atmosphere, the suspense, the heart-pounding terror and multiple slasher kills! Not to mention an excellent chase scene and old-school moviegoing fun! This movie is a landmark for the slasher sub-genre. Even though the original 1978 "Halloween" was an excellent movie full of suspense and terrifying scenes, it wasn't gory. "Friday the 13th" added the gore factor and set the stage for many, many slasher films to follow. Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King and all the others set the stage for the most dreaded day of the year...Friday the 13th! Grab some popcorn and iced tea and dig this one, movie fans! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Well, considering it's Halloween night and this is the last of my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of October" review-fest, I figure I'll end this countdown with one of the absolute most well-known horror movies of all time, and certainly one of the most horrifying, "The Exorcist". Although many quotes, stunts and ideas from this movies have been taken and parodied ("The power of Christ compels!" comes to mind.), this movie nevertheless has the power and terror that basically defines the horror movie genre.Watching "The Exorcist" all the way through is more like an experience than watching a movie. For one thing, the general idea of the movie is a plausible concept, and having been to a paranormal speaker just last night, who ironically spoke of and showed a video of an exorcism for which she witnessed, this sort of thing is not entirely impossible, although it almost never happens. I don't want to dwindle on this part too much, but also regarding that I'm Roman Catholic, this movie definitely hits home with me.But back to the movie itself. It kicks off with a scene that takes place in Egypt if I'm not mistaken, on an excavation dig with the foreign scenery setting a mood and atmosphere that carries throughout the whole movie. Starting the movie like this is an interesting idea, and a concept that hasn't been done too much by other movies, even though it works here. The acting throughout is phenomenal, alongside the special effects, which goes without saying. The whole movie plays out like a terrifying, dark, atmospheric nightmare and never loses its intensity or interest, even in the slower moments. I must say, even though I personally sometimes find it tedious to sit through a movie that goes over two hours long, I think "The Exorcist" definitely has the hudspah (spelling?) to make it pull you in for the whole thing. As dark and terrifying as this movie is, it most certainly still packs a brilliance, alongside talented writing and directing that makes it worth the watch.In short, "The Exorcist" is a film that's just as horrifying as it is both groundbreaking and vastly interesting. Such a movie deserves to go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and considering I'm a guy who's seen countless horror movies, I agree with that statement. Well, the review's about up, but for those that haven't seen such a heart-pounding, groundbreaking, interest-stirring movie yet, this is very highly recommended. And before you sleep, say some prayers just for safety!!! Happy Halloween, everybody, I'm off to smother myself in Halloween candies, household props and going around all evening in my pajama pants. Thanks for the time, and peace.

The Scorpions are definitely one of the greatest and most successful rock bands to emerge out of Germany, and they prove it to you 18 times of on this collection "Bad For Good: The Very Best of Scorpions". Now as you may realize, this is not an absolutely perfect compilation. There is, after all, the three-disc "Box of Scorpions" that goes for around 35 bucks or so. But hey, if you're planning on spending that much money, it might as well be on the original albums, right? Anyway...This compilation has everything, packing a big, German-styled melodic-metal punch that delivers the goods. From the powerhouse rockers of "Blackout", "No One Like You", "Rock You Like A Hurricane" and "Big City Nights", to the beautiful ballads of "Send Me An Angel", "Wind of Change" or "Still Loving You", and the slower, more progressive tracks like "Loving You Sunday Morning" and "The Zoo" this album has plenty of greats.In addition, it comes with two new songs, the balladic "Bad For Good" and the talk-box guitar riff driven "Cause I Love You". Plus, the album comes complete with great linter notes, photos of the band, and pictures of their ever-ridiculous album covers! So if you wanna get into the Scorpions, this is a great place to start. Thanks for the time, and peace.

No matter how much time passes by, this album will stand as a testament to true punk music, and quite possibly the epitome of it. It's quite shocking, honestly, to see how so many guys and gals of my generation (this current one) have no idea what the real "punk rock sound" is. Well, don't worry, I'm not doomed to the same fate.With a great production and lots of extra tracks, "Ramones" runs it at 22 song at over 44 minutes. This means that each song average out to about two minutes. While many bands can make great songs that last far longer, I still think The Ramones are awesome just the way they are. The songs are loud, hard, fast, and quite often funny. Between the energetic anthem "Blitzkrieg Bop", to the horror-themed "Chainsaw" and "I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement", and even the punk-ballad "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", this album really delivers.Basically, "Ramones" is a fast-driving, ageless rock classic and shows you why so many bands inspired to be like them. If you wanna experience great music that doesn't give up, "Ramones" is gonna rock you! Thanks for the time, and peace.

41 minutes of grinding, snarling guitar riffs, pounding drums, chaotic guitar solos and some of the most demonic vocals ever recorded. This is Obituary's "Slowly We Rot". This is hands-down one of the most crucial death metal albums ever recorded! Of course, Cannibal Corpse essentially invented the "brutal death metal" subgenre a year later in 1990 with their "Eaten Back To Life" album, and Death is considered the first, real death metal band, BUT Obituary gave us so much intensity and ferocity with this album, that it's simply mind-blowing.In a similar way to how Slayer took ten songs in 29 minutes with "Reign in Blood", this remastered edition of "Slowly We Rot" contains 14 songs in just over 41 minutes...wow. That's intense, if I do say so myself! Although most of the songs do sound similar and do not contain the dynamics of more progressive or experimental metal sub-genres, there are some interesting touches on several songs. For example, the title track "Slowly We Rot" opens with a slow, almost doom-metal sounding guitar riff. "Gates of Hell" is in the key of B-minor, instead of E-minor like most songs, so the riff is slightly more melodic and creepier.And wow, I still can't get over how evil John Tardy sounds on this album. About 99 percent of the time, his vocals are essentially indecipherable, and yet ironically he doesn't even technically use death growls! He uses a sort of voice more akin to Morbid Angel's vocal work. Between this, Allen and Trevor blasting riff after riff from their guitars and John's brother Don Tardy pounding his drums like it was a dark ritual, this album delivers everything stripped-down, old-school death metal should deliver. A true classic to put it simply! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Cause of Death" sounds rather different than Obituary's debut album "Slowly We Rot". Whereas their debut was essentially a 40 minute blast of stripped-down, raw death metal, but still an extreme metal essential, "Cause of Death" takes things into a more progressive, technical, and shall I even say a classier state of being."Cause of Death" showcases Obituary playing longer, more epic-sounding songs with a much more technical aspect to them. Progressive songwriting is also very abundant here. In fact, I would say that this is to death metal what Metallica's "...And Justice To All" is to thrash metal.In addition, James Murphy, formerly of the band Death, is the lead guitarist on this album. His leads and solos add much more depth to this album than what was demonstrated on "Slowly We Rot". On this album, the guitar solos are less chaotic and random, and instead more classically influenced, melodic and technical. This makes the album even better.Overall, "Cause of Death" is another classic death metal album, and an astounding relase from "Obituary". My only complaint here is the unnecessary cover of Celtic Frost's "Circle of the Tyrants". Honestly, I think that song is covered too much, but still Obituary's cover of it is a great one. And by the way, be sure to get this album in the 2-for-1 deal with "Slowly We Rot". It'll save money and it gives you more Obituary music faster! Well, that about wraps up this review, but still, I can't wait for when the band releases "Darkest Day" in just a few days! Thanks for the time, and peace.

...and that's saying something. Before I get into my review, I just wanna say "Thank You!", to all of you readers out there. Any newcomers who are interesting enough to open this page, thanks! It's good to see that there are still plenty of people in the world who love the work of Frank Zappa. Through his six-volume "You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore" releases to his countless post-humous albums, the man's done it all, but this takes the cake. Along with some other works around this time, "One Size Fits All" is an absolutely essential Zappa tape that should be one of the first in this genius's world of music that should be added to your collection.How to pull off a feat of making the best of a 60+ discography? Simple. Write some great lyrics, work on some impossible songwriting textures, techniques and tempo changes and hire a virtuoso musician that adds up to almost every popular instrument known to man.If I'm exaggerating, I apologize, but stating this album for what it's worth, well then: It's worth the price and then some! In only nine tracks, Zappa and the Mothers of Invention (though this is the last title to include), they pull off a flurry of genres that, when combined together in the right way, makes a leviathan of an album! You have the jazzy, 9-minute opener "Inca Roads", for example. This is one of my favorite Zappa tracks, and included are some impossibly fast marimba/flute work, funny lyrics and a 2-minute plus guitar solo from the man himself! Actually, I love the solo here, not only because it shows how talented Frank Zappa was, but it's memorable, almost to a lusty extent if I may be so bold. I can't get enough of this track, and neither will you if you're looking for some classic Zappa."Can't Afford No Shoes" is a pretty basic, amusing and straight-ahead rock track with a great guitar/drum/piano combo and lyrics that will make you laugh. Both the "Sofas" are jazzy and romantic; the second one includes lyrics in German, which makes sense, considering Frank Zappa is German. However, I must admit I like Sofa No. 1 a bit more.Even though I normally give a track-for-track review of most of the albums I review, and I've left you hanging to see how some of the other songs are, I think I'll just let you find out for youself. After all, there's nothing wrong with a surprise, and it's important to get the heads-up on songs like these for yourself. But if you wanna get into Zappa, this is a positive MUST-BUY.Overall: A few words to describe this album: Epic, Fantastic, Timeless, Romantic, Lyrically Witty, Instrumentally Dazzling, and at the top of the Zappa tapes (I refer to Frank's work as "the Zappa tapes" with my guitar teacher sometimes). To speak in a direct way, I, like many other Zappa fans, consider this to be one of the greatest Frank Zappa albums you're gonna get. So, if you are interested in a number of music genres, are looking for something that's not your typical rock album, or just want to discover the magic and the genius that is Frank Zappa, add this to your list and I hope you'll love it. I know I did!

Phantasm is a late '70s supernatural fantasy horror movie that does a great job of combining atmosphere, creepy nightmares, flying sphere-violence, location, characters, events and scares into one great, big bundle of nightmarish joy.As an artist with a love of all things odd, unusual, beautiful, surreal, spooky and fun, this movie delivers all that and a bag of evil chips from another dimension.Let me describe the highlights and joys of this movie:The creepy, old cemetery setting.The mystical, surreal hallways under the morgue.The flying spheres with daggers at the end that contributed a great gore scene.The almost stereotypical '70s fellas, with their collar-length hair, leather jackets and love of rock.The evil midgets that chase you and spew yellow vomit.The terrifying Tall Man that loves screaming, "Boyyyyy!!!!!".The fact that the movie has the guts to add in a room with a doorway to a parallel universe halfway through.Well, that's saying a lot right there, but I won't give away anything else of the movie. Phantasm has gone on to become a cult favorite of movie lovers everywhere, and if you haven't seen it but wanna watch something cool, scary and unusual, I wholeheartedly recommend this gem. Thanks for the time, and peace.

We've all been there. It's summertime, when you're with a few, great friends and wanna go on a big adventure. Well, that's what "Stand By Me" is about; a brilliant mix of laugh-out-loud humor and introspective moments of awe, it's a movie that never wears thin.The overall plot is that four boys, from ages twelve to thirteen, hear of a dead body and go searching overnight for it. There's plenty of summer adventure in it, big laughs among friends, and that feeling of living in the wild, if only for about forty-eight hours. And then, there's that feeling of change that, for at least one point in our life, we get nervous about. That necessity of holding onto friends even as you get separated from there. It puts you in such a state, as it's displayed in such an honest, realistic way that it captivates you all the way through.What impresses me a lot about "Stand By Me" is how it just seems to carry on at full speed. There never seems to be a dull moment and by the time it's over, you may feel astonished that it's already done with. Like with a lot of other, great movies, this one has many, sub-situations the four guys get themselves into, and if it's not enough that they're racing a gang of older guys and outrun a junkyard dog, need I say more than such things as "campfire stories" or "a lake of leeches"? *shudders*Without revealing the resolution, the ending shows the adult Gordie, who has been narrating the whole thing. The ending is very powerful and moving, and as the credits roll, the '61 song "Stand By Me" plays.This is an excellent summer movie that goes by quickly, but leaves such an impression on you that you'll remember and love it forever. But through all the drama and action, it's a definite work of art that's sure to please anyone who sees it.

Honestly, I was quite impressed with this movie. After the terrible sleaze-fest known as "Sleepaway Camp", I was wondering if another "at camp" slasher was a bad idea. Also having seen the raft massacre scene before viewing this movie, a scene I saw coming ten miles away, I was a little suspicious.PHEW! Was I ever wrong! "The Burning" is a suspenseful but entertaining, gory but exciting, shocking but fun movie. It has everything you could probably think of in an '80s slasher movie. Great special effects, buckets of gore, gratuitous amounts of nudity, exciting chase scenes and a happy ending. It's also got quite a realistic atmosphere, save the whole concept of a guy getting a body burn and then becoming inhumanly threatening.There's also a good deal of character development and humor to boot. The comedy doesn't necessarily speed along the plot, but it DOES add to the entertainment. Believe it or not, we have a younger Jason Alexander (George Costanza on the wonderful "Seinfeld") as one of the camp counselors. Everything about this movie is great!So if you want another classic slasher film for a night of thrills, chills and female body parts exposed in the shower, strike a match for this one! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Sonata Arctica represents all that is great about European power metal: The fast tempos, energetic drums, crazy guitar riffs, blazing solos, soaring vocal melodies, mystical keyboard highlights and interesting-as-ever lyrics. All of that is presented in its utmost glory here on "Ecliptica". This album is a nice slab of true power metal, and shows the band can do both an uptempo headbanger and a beautiful ballad. My personal favorite on the album is "Kingdom For A Heart", a gorgeous anthem with some insane riffs and solos, a beautiful after-solo section, and an overall romantically yearning mood. The rest of the songs on here are great, as well. Highly recommended for fans of power metal! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I don't own the "Misery" DVD, but I have seen it three times, and each time, the movie is just as shocking and intense as before. Rob Reiner is the director, and adapts the Stephen King novel to the screen. Considering most of the film takes place in a bedroom, you're going to need a pretty good script to keep such a concept alive and interesting. Fortunately, "Misery" is full of interesting plot developments, and as the story moves along, nothing feels boring or tedious. In fact, two of the times I saw this movie were back-to-back on TV (thanks for that, AMC!), and I can honestly say I watched it both times, in a row, without ever getting bored.In addition to Rob Reiner's great directing, we have the talented acting of James Kahn and Kathy Bates, both of whom portray their characters quite realistically and believably. The realism of their acting is partially what makes this movie so frightening, because James Kahn and Kathy Bates make it seem like this sort of things could actually happen, which is a powerful tool in horror movies. In addition, there's no way you can give this movie less than 5 stars after seeing the heart-pounding, realistic terror in the climax!Well, my time here is done. In closing, this is a highly-recommended horror movie for those that want to see an excellent, entertaining and nerve-wracking work of horror genius, especially if you're interested in seeing the realistic side of horror movies. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Charles Band. His name appears in the credits for more movies than car insurance posters appear on the sides of buses. He's one of my favorite director-writer-producers in the horror business, and 18 years after the original "Demonic Toys", he's here with the legitimate sequel, "Demonic Toys 2: Personal Demons". Although "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys" is technically a sequel, it's also really moreso a "superfilm" like Freddy Vs. Jason or any of the versions of Dracula Vs. Frankenstein. So for all intents and purposes, let's say this is the actual, definitive part-two for "Demonic Toys". How does it fare? Read on to find out.Well, like many Full Moon movies, this film looks like it was shot 10 years before it actually was, due to how everything appears on the camera. The fact that it looks a little aged is actually charming in a way. Now onto the characters. I gotta admit, a lot of these characters were really stereotypical and the sort of actions and dialogue they did were pretty predictable, particularly Lauraline. For crying out loud, how much more by-the-numbers of a two-faced, stuck-up, rich sourpuss could she be? You know the kind, the sort of girl that plays the rival in teen flicks.The setting and events also aren't that original, either. The creepy old castle has been done to death, although I do like the fact that it takes place in Italy. Also, the seance, Lauraline planning to leave her fiance with the cowboy handyman character, and the whole idea of Caitlin being the caretaker of the valuables in the castle, has all been done in one way or another. Granted, with everything that has been done in the history of horror films, it isn't easy to be original, but I feel like they could've thought a little harder about some of these things.Now for the all-stars: the demonic toys! Baby Oopsy Daisy and Jack Attack are quite similar to their original portrayals in the original Demonic Toys, although there's both a loss and a gain here. Jack Attack doesn't overkill his laugh nearly as much as he did in "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys", so he's a lot less annoying in this movie. That's good. Baby Oopsy Daisy on the other hand, is a LOT more annoying in this film, with more bad one-liners, overtly tongue-in-cheek dialogue and it just feels like the writers tried too hard to give the doll a nasty attitude. The addition of the Italian doll made for an interesting addition. Overall, the appeal of the villains suffered a little bit in this movie but they're still entertaining and worth their screentime.As in the original, there are some great gore shots here and that earns this movie more points. However, I WOULD like to point out the CGI effects. A few times in the movie, you can clearly see the CGI blood effects, and it just looks flat-out terrible. Compared to some of the other gore shots, the CGI bits look so fake, it's kinda embarrassing. It's too bad because a lot of the other effects throughout the movie were cool-looking, I wish they didn't resort to CGI for some things.Now for the ending. It's hard to describe one's reaction to and opinion of a movie's end without giving it away, but conclusions can make or break a horror film. This one ended a little strange, it didn't promise a sequel that would never arrive, unlike a lot of horror films nowadays do (something that really irritates me) but at the same time it didn't feel like everything was conclusive. Either way, the ending was more satisfying than a fair deal of other modern horror films.With all of my negative perspectives on this movie, I'm sure you're wondering why I gave it a three-star rating instead of something lower. Well I'll tell you why, movies in this field are made to entertain. Some films like "Burnt Offerings" or "The Shining" scare you and get you to think, but movies like "Demonic Toys 2" are for the enjoyment and entertaining of gorehounds like myself. This movie entertained me in its 80 minutes, so it did what it set out to do.Overall, "Demonic Toys 2" is a little disappointing considering the shoes it had to fill of the original and the all-star "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys" superfilm, but for what it is, it's an enjoyable supernatural horror movie with some really good gore shots and is low-budget entertainment done right. Check it out at least once. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Led Zeppelin has always seemed to be a gem among gems. When you combine Robert Plant's spirited vocals, Jimmy Page's outrageously revolutionary guitar playing, John Paul Jones's wizardry over the bass and keys, and of course, John Bonham's masterful madhouse of drumming, you get the rock and roll behemoth that is Led Zeppelin. And while they have given birth to such popular songs as the haunting "Kashmir" (Physical Grafitti), the heavenly headbanger "Communication Breakdown" (Led Zeppelin 1) and what is probably the greatest rock and roll song ever "Stairway To Heaven" (Zoso), this album is something even more.Back in 1969, when people were probably least expecting it, came along this titan of an album. Within are tree-trunk drums, deep basslines, soaring vocals, and a truckload of awesome guitar riffs. For musicians, this album is like gold, for it forever changed guitar and drum playing. And for music lovers everywhere, it's a festival of good old rock 'n' roll music. Through these nine tracks, the four, then-young rockers of Led Zep take you through a journey of funk-influenced, strongly blues-based hard rock that is sheer joy."Whole Lotta Love": A great song carried by the legendary guitar riff and similar bassline. After a minute and a half long break of percussion, guitar effects and spacey vocals, which give this song a very surreal feel to it, a smashing solo rips through by none other than Jimmy Page!"What Is And What Should Never Be": Progressive verses build up to an explosive and very funky chorus, along with some mystical lyrics to accompany this very cool song."The Lemon Song": A slower and longer song that's quite blues-based, where John Paul Jones shines as a bassist. Just goes to show how underrated the man was as a musician."Thank You": An excellent ballad combining superior acoustic guitars, dreamy keyboard lines, and an amazing vocal/lyrical. A truly beautiful song to put it simply."Heartbreaker": A personal gem on the album. The funky drums and stunning guitar riff carry this song through. It's also got two of the greatest guitar solos of all time. Definitely one of Zeppelin's best songs."Living Loving Maid": I just don't understand why the band doesn't care for this song, because it's great. Even though it's short, at only two and a half minutes, the heavy drumbeat and funky riff make this one a real rocker."Ramble On": Starts off acoustic but has a great build-up. The instrumentation and lyrics make this one an awesome Led Zeppelin folk song, as they have done some great ones."Moby Dick: Legendary drum performance, pure and simple. Every drummer should listen to this, as it changed drumming history for good. Of course, this has something for guitarists/guitar enthusiasts, too, as it's got a fantastic, but incredibly deep, slow-strut riff to it."Bring It On Home": A wonderful closer to the album. The first thirty seconds are bass-playing and Robert Plant on the harmonica. Actually, this works really well, as this song, like others, has a build-up. At the high point of the song, the guitar and drums come in for an excellent solo and stellar riff.Basically speaking, this album inspired a generation. Everything about this album is great, as every song is strong, some, though, stronger than others. But to get my point across, this is a milestone in classic rock history and I would definitely recommend this, especially to classic rock/guitar/Led Zeppelin fans, especially newcomers to Led Zeppelin. Hope you all enjoy this one, 'cause like I've said before, it's a real gem!

"Hatebreeder" is an incredibly solid album by Children of Bodom, and between their extremely tight and impressive musicianship, solid songwriting and Alexi Laiho's trademark shriek, are definitely one of the strongest metal bands in the present day, regardless of how recognized they are by the public eye.This album has everything a great extreme metal album would have: jaw-dropping guitar and keyboard duos, complex drumming complete with rapid double bass, intruging lyrics (even if they're not on the level of other music artists, but that doesn't lessen the greatness of this album), and barking vocals. Plus, you get mind-blowing speed on songs such as "Warheart" and "Silent Night, Bodom Night". Honestly, the tremolo guitar tapping and hammer-ons of Silent Night, Bodom Night are just so energetic! Plus, the band takes on a romantic theme in "Bed of Razorz", and an epic sort of storytelling in "Downfall", plus all the other songs are just as well-written and headbang-able.So, in short Children of Bodom's "Hatebreeder" is indeed a modern metal classic, and touches base with extreme power metal, melodic death metal, black metal and speed metal. Fans of any of these genres will definitely love this album as I do. Also, I would recommend getting the version with the two, extra songs and the music video, but either way, you're getting a classic with this one. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"The Great Southern Trendkill" is not usually considered one of Pantera's best albums, what with "Cowboys From Hell" and "Vulgar Display of Power" being two of the most successful, and two of the most common fan-favorites. However, "The Great Southern Trendkill" is undoubtedly a bludgeoning metal classic that should be in any Pantera fan's collection!The music here is much heavier and abrasive than "Cowboys From Hell", and the lyrics are far more explicit, but this album definitely has its own selection of Pantera classics. You get such screeching, enraged and thundering metal moshers such as "The Great Southern Trendkill" and "War Nerve". Then Pantera shows you that they've got some of the catchiest extreme-metal riffs around with such songs as "Drag The Waters" and "13 Steps To Nowhere". But wait, there's more! The band shows their skill at crafting softer songs, with "Suicide Note Part 1", which is filled with nice keyboards, and the beautiful guitar epic "Floods". Honestly, "Floods" is such a classic song and one of the most amazing outros in the history of modern music, it's a work of art.So while most of the riffs aren't as complex as those on "Cowboys From Hell" and the heaviness has been turned up a bit since "Far Beyond Driven", Pantera has still made a metal classic with "The Great Southern Trendkill". A friendly warning, this is NOT for the fainthearted! But this is highly recommended for all extreme-metal fans. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Considering I've been reviewing a lot of the old-school horror classics, I figure I'll give this one a spin. "When A Stranger Calls" is an intriguing late '70s horror film, taking some influence from "Halloween", which came out a year before. Comparatively, this movie is a lot less known, almost a sleeper film, which is one of the reasons I find it so enjoyable. I appreciate movies that have aged to perfection without getting major mainstream exposure, while still standing the test of time. And as you guessed, "When A Stranger Calls" stands the test of time.I'm also grateful for Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments countdown, because had it not been for that, it probably would've taken me longer to find this sleeper masterpiece.One thing that makes this movie so interesting is the style of it. The first half-hour is like a Hitchcock-influenced slasher film, whereas the middle half-hour is a well thought-out and brilliantly developed police story, before going back to slasher horror in the last half hour. This sort of progression throughout the movie, along with the blending of two different genres of movies, makes for an interesting twist, and quite a unique work of art.The tension in the first 30 minutes is both incredibly realistic, and nauseatingly intense. I can't think of any concept more plausible than a creepy stranger calling your house and asking to check on the children you're babysitting...over and over, nonetheless! Something that seems so likely to happen makes for some real scares, and a great way to start off the movie.Within the next 30 minutes, a police story is developed, where the cops pursue the escaped murderer. Although this kind of shifts the focus away from the Hitchcock-influenced slasher elements of the movie, this part of the movie is thoroughly entertaining and interesting. In this half-hour, we also get a look at the maniac, showing what a crazy individual he is, taking us into the psychological aspect of every slasher film.The last third of the movie takes us back to the edge-of-your-seat slasher-film tension. I don't want to give much more away because I don't want to ruin the movie, but let's just say that this part of the film is where the main characters vows not to let history repeat itself, alongside the recurrence of the killer. The ending is one that'll make your heart pound until it's in your throat!In short, "When A Stranger Calls" is a timeless and terrifying sleeper of a classic, and proves that even 30 years after its release, nothing in horror is so unnerving as real life. A highly recommended movie! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Skimming through the free on-demand movies, I came across this one and it caught my interest. "Kill Theory" is an intriguing movie that blends the elements of '80s slasher films such as "Friday the 13th" with the suspense/tension/torture-film elements of "Saw" and a dark, nightmarish setting that rounds it all off. This movie has a lot going for it: a clever and twisted villain, great atmosphere, and it certainly goes hard with the gore (the scene where that one jerk got bludgeoned in the skull with a shovel says it all!)One thing that did bother me was that, despite reviving the whole college-kids-on-vacation theme being a positive, it felt kind of rushed because it was almost forced right into from the beginning. It was like the movie-makers were saying "Okay, here's a half-dozen characters, instantly connect with them." It also got a little tedious in parts, however it still has quite a few moments of suspense that round it all off.All in all, this was an interesting, suspenseful and gory movie that I think deserves more recognition, if only for the fact that it's not a Z-grade remake of a horror classic. Check it out if you get the chance! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Being yet another movie that comes from The Golden Era of Horror Films, "The Fog" contains all the elements that make up a classic horror movie. It's got a great and chilling atmosphere with the mysterious fog that rolls in and out, a really cool setting with the city on the bay, great monsters that are in this case, the ghosts of the sailors, and there's even some good gore shots throughout.Although the pace of this movie is not the fastest in a horror film, I think it's suitable to the overall atmosphere of the movie, which for the most part, is dark and surreal, the sort of tone that's set on a movie you'd watch on a stormy Friday night. By the time the movie climaxes at the end, you'll definitely feel the impact and the wait will indeed be worth it. The ending, however, is the most likely part of the movie that will be the most debatable among horror fans. I personally felt that, for the most part, it was satisfying, although it the tone of the ending was a little awkward, almost as though the writers were preparing a sequel.With all said and done, "The Fog" is a classic, atmospheric horror movie and is highly recommended to fans seeking such a film. An ideal movie for Halloween time, be sure to pick it up in time for the 31st! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Near Dark is a very intersting horror movie in every sense of the word "interesting", and "horror". It's a vampire-western crossover film, combining the charm of Western movie characters with the violence and midnight adrenaline of vampire horror. Here's the skinny:-Caleb, a likeable Southern guy falls for Mae, a newcomer to his town. While on a "date", a kiss turns to a bite that turns Caleb into a vampire. Now he's kidnapped by Mae's vampire clan, featuring the sinister leader, played by Lance Henriksen, alongside the hilarious, rough, vulgar-mouthed and pretty much all-around AWESOME Bill Paxton. And I'm not just worshipping his role because I share first names with him, Bill Paxton dominates in this movie.-Now, one of the "interesting" facets of this movie is the twist. Horror movies are about what happens to people, and while the events in the plot of Near Dark are crucial, the character development is just as vital in this movie as in a comedy or drama movie. You step inside the world of the vampires, learn to love them, or hate them, your pick.-General Info about the movie:VIOLENCE AND TERROR: Well, there's no shortage of action in this movie. Just look at the whopping eight and a half minute roadhouse scene to get what I mean. As far as vampire horror goes, there isn't any, real horror to speak of, it's more like an exploitation sorta thing going on as opposed to something chasing you in the desert.LANGUAGE: Oh man, is this where Bill Paxton comes in. I think there's a good 55 profanities dropped in this film. And it's often used towards the comedic side of everything. As far as comedy goes for slitting a guy's throat with your spurs (yes, the roadhouse scene)SEX 'N' NUDITY: No nudity or sex to speak of, although those scenes where Caleb's drinking Mae's blood for food will make you go "Hubba hubba!", as they are presented rather erotically, shall I say.THE BOTTOM LINE:"Near Dark" possesses a very strange atmosphere to it. There's a very surreal tone to the whole movie, and it's a lot more mystical than you'd expect from what sounds like a Dracula-John Wayne crossover, even though that's technically not what the film is. The ambient music from German band Tangerine Dream only adds to the dreamlike mood. The way the movie's presented in all its surreal glory, makes you feel like you're missing something, even if you've seen the movie several times.Fortunately, the movie's ending satisfies, and though I won't give it away, made me feel good. Also, there's a bonus disc full of extra features, that offers even more bang for your buck.Well, if you want a surreal, violent and fast-paced horror movie with odd, "interesting" characters that brings something new to the horror table, check this item off the menu. It's a horror movie that offers a main course you'll want to feast off for quite some time! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever. We all know that. This dual-disc compilation (enhanced with special live performances when played on your computer) gives us 23 tracks from their whole career.Pros:- If you're just getting into Led Zep, this should briefly suffice. The price is affordable, and you get 23 of their best songs.- It gives you tracks from every studio album.- As I mentioned, there are live performances of two tracks, "Communication Breakdown" and "Kashmir".Cons:- There are too many tracks missing - "Heartbreaker", "Living Loving Maid", "Misty Mountain Hop", "The Ocean", etc.- On the first disc, there are five songs from "Zoso". If there are that many, you might as well just get that album. The same goes for "Physical Graffiti", though that's also a dual-disc album so that somewhat changes.- There are no live tracks (on most compilations there are one or two live songs)Overall:This could be much better, but it got me into Led Zeppelin. As it says in my title, the music is 5 stars but the actual compilation, 3. Jimmy Page should have known. Well, to sum it up, the music's great but if you want to clean out the Led Zep catalogue, get the bigger box set "Complete Studio Recordings".Long Live Led Zeppelin!

When Kiss released "Hotter Than Hell", they were still trying to discover their niche. Their make-up had changed, and they experimented with a Japanese kabuki style for their sophomore album. That being said, "Hotter Than Hell" may have a different feel to it than some other Kiss albums. Their first album was great and opened the gateways for Kiss. This album, quite heavier than their debut, has some different vibes to it, here and there. However, with that being said, I think this is definitely a great album. While it still contains that blues influence of their debut, it seems to have prefigured the grunge-rock of the '90s, but is still an interesting gem even if you don't care for the grunge sound.One thing you should know is that this album may be a little harder to find. I got mine offline, so maybe that's the way you should get it. However, if you're ever in the music store and see this, pick it up! My usual, track-for-track review following will help strengthen my reason to believe that every Kiss fan should own this."Got To Choose": Great riff with a cool groove and the Kiss-styled blues influence. Actually, even though this is the opener, this is the longest song on the album, and at only 3:54! Really good way to start off the album."Parasite": Love that riff! Peter Criss puts in some wicked drumming, Gene's vocal performance is high-quality, and Ace's stunning guitar soloing will leave you wanting more! Absolute rocker!"Goin' Blind": A redo from Gene and Paul's Wicked Lester days. A haunting ballad-style song that I tend to think of as a "half-ballad". It has the feel of one, but is a bit more potent than your typical ballad. I always get such a strange image when I hear Gene sing, "But you're sixteen and I'm ninety-three"."Hotter Than Hell": Another nice riff-rocker, and actually, this is a song about rejection that I don't mind hearing! Love the transition riff, it adds the heaviness to this one, and Ace's slow-motion blazing solo does, as well."Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll": At only 2:14, one would never think that so much incredible guitar work could be displayed in this anthem. An underrated, if short, Kiss gem that should definitely be enjoyed by your ears."All The Way": This is one of those songs that contains lyrics that aren't really too serious. I mean, hearing Gene sing things like, "You keep talking to your mother and father/ One of these days you're gonna push me all the way!", or however the lyric goes, shows that while Kiss can be heavy, they aren't neccessarily stiff or dark."Watchin' You": What a song! We got ourselves a sexy, heavy riff and some interesting lyrics, not to mention more of Ace's great guitar soloing. I love how at the end, they slightly change the lyric and sing, "Everybody else is here, watchin' us!"."Mainline": The second-longest song on the album, at just a few seconds shorter than "Got To Choose". I got a kick outta hearin' Gene sing "I'm needin' some lovin'/ I'm hot like an oven/ It's so true". Actually, this song works well, in contrast to the darker shades of the lyrics in "Watchin' You"."Coming Home": A melodic anthem with a catchy guitar riff, however, surprisingly, I don't recall a solo in this one! *gasp* Aw well, this two and a half minute rocker is still great."Strange Ways": A super-heavy riff rocker that's a really good way to end the album. Peter Criss's voice is perfect for the song, I just how soulful he sings the lyrics, especially when he sings, "So you can realize/ That I can set you free!". And Ace Frehley provides an outstandingly superb Jimi Hendrix-esque guitar solo. Such an awesome song with that F-minor groove!Overall: While this may be different from other Kiss album, like others, it has its pros and cons, but is a great addition to any Kiss fan's collection. As I stated before, this is a rare find in store, but if you find it, you should definitely get it (or here on Amazon, that works well, too, obviously!). I hope you enjoy it like I did, rock on, and peace!

Wow, this is a great album. I don't even know where to begin, so, I'll just praise it a little and give some facts. This is, of course, Kiss's first album, with ten rockin' songs at a bit over a half hour. It's got the original line-up of Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. It's just too bad they couldn't keep the classic line-up, 'cause Criss and Frehley were great musicians. At this point, I would also like to add an interesting fact, or maybe just an opinion: While KISS is definitely a classic rock/glam rock/hair metal band, if you think enough, they were a little more. Ace's guitar solos were pretty blues-based, kinda like Angus Young but in a pretty different style. Peter Criss's drum-playing, although it was definite hard-rock style, are still jazz-influenced (listen to the end of "Cold Gin" and you'll see.) Anyway, back to some more strong points. This album is also highly accessible, for I've seen this record in just about every music store I've been to. There isn't a single, weak track on this album, in fact, I'd probably say this would be one of my "desert island" albums. You know, one of the albums I'd bring along with me if I was stuck on a deserted island. And, to back up how much I love each song, I'll give a track-for-track review:Strutter 100/100: From the first time I heard the opening drums, I knew I was in for something special. One of the all-time greatest Kiss songs and a true rocker. After hearing this, you know that you're in for a good time.Nothin' To Lose 91/100: Anthemic rocker sung by Gene with a great riff. Love the sing-a-long chorus and a great hook, too.Firehouse 90/100: Sorta similar to "Nothin' To Lose" with another great, sing-a-long chorus. The only thing I don't like about this song is the fire truck driven at the end, it gets kinda annoying.Cold Gin 100/100: Fun and catchy with some of the greatest guitar work on the album. I love the ending drum solo Peter Criss pounds out at the end. Definitely one of Kiss's best songs.Let Me Know 100/100: Another of my favorite songs on the album. The vocal harmony right before the explosive guitar work at about the 2-minute mark signals the raw energy and passion in this song. No matter what anybody says about this song, it's still a real rocker!Kissin' Time 100/100: Whether it's a cover or not, it's still an awesome song with a great chorus that kind of tells how Kiss's successful career would go.Deuce 96/100: I never really understood most of the lyrics, so I can't rate this entirely perfect...HOWEVER! This has, along with "Cold Gin" and "Let Me Know", has some of the finest guitar work on the entire album! The riff rocks and the closing solo is a mammoth of a guitar shredder!Love Theme From KISS 92/100: A jazzy instrumental that KISS would never do again, but for what it is, it's definitely awesome, especially the drumwork Peter Criss gives us.100,000 Years 95/100: Gene leads this song all the way with his lead vocals and basswork. More great guitar work and Peter Criss's legendary solo are found in this song, don't miss it!Black Diamond 94/100: A dark song, especially for KISS. The acoustic opening grabs your attention, and the song has something of a Black Sabbath feel, especially the heavy and distorted, almost sludgy, closing. Nevertheless, this song has an epic feel and stands strong.So, to summarize my review, every track is strong, some in their own way, but it's a definite essential in any KISS, classic rock, glam rock, hair/proto-hair, or '70s collection. Believe me, if you want great KISS that just rocks out loud and lets you have a great, fun time, you'll love this one. And to all KISS fans around the world, rock on!

Interaction with the audience, blazing guitar work, mind-blowing drums, rollicking bass, high-volume power and buckets of endless fun...this is what live hard-rock in the '70s was all about. And Kiss delivers it to you with style and passion. From the seemingly endless, yet still impressive drum solo in "100,000 Years", to Paul's talking between songs to Ace's always stunning guitar work, (Deuce, Rock and Roll All Nite... you get the picture). You should have no doubts while buying this album and expecting energetic, glammed-up rock and roll by Kiss, 'cause you're gonna get a whole lotta that. Hopefully, you'll love it like I do! Of course, here's a tip: If you've got the money for this, it would be a great idea to shell out a few extra bucks and get the "Alive! Box Set". I've seen "Alive!", sold by itself for as much as $25, but the "Alive! Box Set" gives you the 3 Alive! discs, plus the previously unreleased Millennium Concert, for $37, just twelve bucks more, which is how I was exposed to the Alive! albums. Well, hope you all enjoy this one, 'cause to quote basically every announcer - You wanted the best, you got the best, the hottest band in the world, Kiss!

After the release of the legendary "Alive!", Kiss went back into the studio to make a great follow-up. That studio follow-up is "Destroyer". It's hard to say if this is Kiss's best studio album, since their works from 1974-1977 were all great. Whatever your point of view is, this is a true work of art in the KISS catalogue. It's got some of their greatest anthems and their most popular song, the ballad "Beth". If you've ever bought a Kiss compilation album, you've probably noticed several tracks from this album on there, because there will definitely be at least a few. The only problems here are that because some tracks are so great, others pail in comparison. Also, the fact that Space Ace was M.I.A. in several tracks brings it down."Detroit Rock City" 10/10: When I heard the edited version on "The Very Best of Kiss", my first Kiss album, I didn't know the opening newscast. However, that just builds up the suspense for what is probably the greatest KISS song ever! Strong guitar attack with some cannon drumming!"King of the Night Time World" 10/10: Although the end is kinda repetitive, this song is a definite feel-good rocker."God of Thunder" 10/10: Dark 'n' dirty riff with one of Gene's greatest performances. This song became legendary, pure and simple."Great Expectations" 5/10: Sorry, but this is a song that goes in the wrong direction. It has a little bit of a weird feel to it, and that's about it."Flaming Youth" 9/10: There are some keyboards thrown in to this anthemic rocker. It's got a cool riff, too, and is one of the better songs on the album."Sweet Pain" 8/10: While this is a very good song, the riff keeps going and the chorus repeats itself a little, too much."Shout It Out Loud" 10/10: One of the definitive Kiss rockers. Great guitars, bass and drums all the way and the lyrical/vocal delivery just adds to its greatness!"Beth" 10/10: A sweet and gentle ballad that rounds out the feel of the album perfectly. I'm glad to hear Peter Criss's vocals on this song, as it's one of the few songs he does sing."Do You Love Me?" 10/10: This one has a swanky strut of a feel to it, and is all-around awesome."Bonus Track 1, aka Rock and Roll Party" 7/10: I don't know what this is, except it's a minute-and-a-half-long track. Paul mumbles the first part but then you can hear him belt out "Let's have ourselves a rock and roll party!". Whenever I wanna just keep this album running, I let this one play.Overall: 89/100: This one gets a solid B+ for some really great tracks. However, some aren't as good as others but "Destroyer" is still an excellent studio album from Kiss. All fans should definitely own this, and all new-comers to Kiss should pick this one up, as it is highly recommended.

Even though I've been listening to quite a wide and ranging variety of classic rock for a while, I never bought a Rush album...until just two days ago. When I got home, I sat on my bed and listened to _2112_'s 20 minute + title track. And holy smokes, this thing blew me out of the water, into pieces and sent me into space! I was missing out on something. The _2112_ title track definitely deserves to live up to its fame and glory. Neil Peart's lyrics bring intricate depth to heavy metal and his drumming remains unmatched, while Geddy Lee's excellent vocals and low-key bass, and Alex Lifeson's shockingly amazing riffs and solos round out the band perfectly.Now, for the next half of the album."A Passage to Bangkok" - My personal favorite song from the second side of the album. The opening riff, brief Eastern sitar and adventurous lyrics make this almost as good as "2112", whether or not it was as long as it. This is one song to listen to while driving on the open highway!"The Twilight Zone" - As it has been brought up by others, this seems to be a tribute to Rod Serling. Somewhat a creepy song, but still something to listen to."Lessons" - A bit of a weaker track compared to the last two. Well, the major chords thrown in by Lifeson and Geddy's vocals make it a worthwhile song."Tears" - A gentle ballad that was written totally by Geddy. This, like most of the other B-side songs opens up with an acoustic guitar."Something for Nothing" - The fast pace and power chords make this four-minute track good, but some of the lyrics are a little, too hard (it's all about making it in the real world). Nevertheless, Rush is able to pull through and make the last verse, as always, intricate and wortwhile.Overall:_2112_ is an excellent album with a brilliant concept title track, and most of the rest of the album is very good, too. Now I don't have a huge collection of Rush albums (but I still know a good deal about them) and as others would say, this is a great place to start with the band. Even if you've never heard a song from these guys, but you like progressive rock and love a good and adventurous concept, give these guys a chance. You can't go wrong with the classics.

Although its a brilliant, humorous, gory and entertaining horror movie, "Basket Case" is a movie that's probably not for everybody. For those seeking a big-budget, two-and-a-half-hour psychological affair with more twists and turns than your brain has room for, this is NOT for you.HOWEVER!!!If you want a low-budget, high-quality cheap-thrill of a comedy-horror crossover, "Basket Case" will become your new beloved Friday night splatter-fest. The plot has been retold in other reviews, so I won't get to that. However, I WILL pinpoint the highlights of this movie in hopes that they will inspire you to go check it out:- Lots of blood and gore. You can tell how cheap the special effects are, but that's part of what makes them so great!- Lots of cheap laughs/jokes, etc.. At one point, Duane and the nice lady across the hall from him, forget her name, go to a bar and have a little too much booze. Drunken hilarity ensured!- Colorful and imaginative characters. There's a budding romance between Duane and the girl that works at a doctor's office he visits at one point. This adds a nice touch throughout the movie.- Brotherly relations. Throughout the movie, we also see some develeopment between Duane and his severed brother, Belial. This actually adds depth to the movie and makes it even more interesting.- Shocking ending. I won't give away what happens, but after you watch this movie, just know that there's a sequel so anything that may happen to Duane or Belial isn't permanent. (THANK GOD!)In conclusion, "Basket Case" is a low-budget comedy-horror crossover full of cheap laughs, heavy gore, some brilliant character development and an ending that ensures a dynamic sequel! Pick this up for your rainy Friday night, kick back and enjoy the madness! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Considering grunge music isn't known for its wailing lead vocals or experimental textures (aside from, maybe, Dinosaur Jr., but that's another story), Soundgarden certainly defined their own sound. On "Badmotorfinger", the twelve songs, filling in at over 57 minutes, demonstrate their versatile sound. And with song titles like "Room A Thousand Years Wide" and "Face Pollution", you know this is gonna be an interesting album.For starters, let me say the band has quality musicianship. Chris Cornell is one of the greatest singers out there, and he proves it to you over and over. Kim Thayil stomps out some of the trippiest ten-ton riffs around and adds a unique feeling to the band's sound. Ben Shepherd and Matt Cameron also prove themselves a strong rhythm section, rounding out the quartet.Like I was saying, "Badmotorfinger" demonstrates the band's versatile sound. Even from the first three songs, they go from the hard-rocking psychedelia of "Rusty Cage" to the sludge-riffing heavy metal of "Outshined", and the grunge/experimental rock of "Jesus Christ Pose".Oh, and it doesn't let up there. They show a hardcore punk influence on "Face Pollution" (also featuring an almost Frank Zappa-styled progressive-rock measure) and "Drawing Flies", which also shows the use of horns and a Black Sabbath-styled boogie.In addition, they show a keen sense of melody and more high-pitched wailing on "Holy Water". Plus, a really strong sense of songwriting is shown in "Searching With My Good Eye Closed". It goes from a nice, relaxed feel to an epic build up with some great guitar work at the end.Overall, I feel that "Badmotorfinger" is definitely a five-star classic. If you're interested in a heavy, experimental album with great musicianship, odd time signatures, passionate vocals and great hooks, this is something you're gonna treasure. Thanks for the time, and peace.

In today's day and age, Sevendust is a seriously underrated band, and deserve to garner more attention than they do. "Home" is an album that proves how good they truly are, regardless of whether or not they're at the height of popularity other bands are at. And regardless of what other bands do, Sevendust did their job and hit one out of the ballpark with this one.One of the first things that must be said here is that Lajon Witherspoon is a GREAT vocalist. Very soulful singing, emotional, and powerful, everything a good metal vocalist needs. In fact, his vocal tone almost adds a sort of R&B; element to some of the songs. In addition to him, the band is able to distribute riff after riff after riff throughout this album. Beneath these great, heavy, catchy guitar riffs are Morgan Rose's amazing drumming. In an era when speed seems to be the only thing that matters to a lot of metal bands, Morgan Rose is able to bring back a seriously infectious groove into all of Sevendust's songs. There's a certain grooving, stomping rhythm that you just can't ignore, great to tap your foot to, headbang to, or mosh to.Overall, "Home" is a highly recommended album that shows a band progressing to be as amazing as they can be, and this is already solid proof that they're already pretty great. To all metalheads that want an album full of heavy, catchy riffs, infectious grooves, and incredible vocals, this is the way to go! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"The Sandlot" is an excellent movie based on such topics as friendship, baseball in the old lot, and a crush on that beauty you always see. But what about it makes it so irresistable?For one thing, it's pure fun. Scotty Smalls is new to the neighborhood, and as his stepfather leaves for a week on a business trip, Scotty loses his stepfather's priceless Babe Ruth-signed baseball, thinking it was just another baseball. Seeing him and all his new-found friends go completely over the top to retrieve the ball from the neighbor's giant beast of a dog is sure to prove a great time.Not to give too much away, but there's another awesome scene at the city pool where Squints fakes drowning just to make out with his crush, Wendy the lifeguard! You must see the look on his face right before he does so!At the end of the movie, when the plot is resolved and all is well, the movie catches up with modern times (as it is set in 1962). The older Scotty Smalls is the narrator and tells how each of his friends resulted in their careers and such. It may have been done before, but for me, it's a technique that never,ever gets old!Aside the main plot, there are quite a few other situations the characters get themselves into, including the summer carnival and a sleepover in the treehouse (a scene which sports the immortal, "You're killing me, Smalls!" line, and a so-ridiculous-it's-awesome campfire tale of The Beast). In addition, there's a baseball game against a Little League team which returns to the baseball overview of the movie."The Sandlot", as previously mentioned, is an absolute joyride full of laughs, great, powerful, dramatic moments (especially in Benny's dream) and is a very nostalgic movie that will leave you feeling great, as a great movie should. A summer viewing essential, this is a definite five-star movie!

One of the first horror films in history, although not the very first (1896's two-minute silent film "La Manoir Du Diablo" and 1910's absolute original "Frankenstein" both beat this movie), "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is, to say the least, a landmark film in horror movies. Being that I watched it through the eyes of a younger horror fan, I noticed some interesting aspects. For one thing, this movie is way ahead of its time. The scenery and the use of it, something that I'll get to in a minute, is something that's rarely touched upon even nowadays, well over 80 years after the movie was made.The scenery is really what makes this movie such a masterpiece and a film far beyond its contemporary time-frame. The settings in this movie make it like a film version of a Salvador Dali painting. All the buildings seem crooked and surreal, and the fact that whatever appears onscreen is surrounded by black even gives it the appearance of the classic "dream bubble" sort of imagery. The entire movie has a very dreamlike, actually more like nightmarish, quality to it, that takes you to another place and is, even today, unlike many many other horror films.Another thing I find great about this movie is the acting. Silent films are usually considered movies where overacting is almost a given. However, I really didn't think there were any moments here where the acting was way too over the top. For a silent film, the acting was quite good, and the dialogue (for a silent film, which would be the words that appear on screen to read, of course) is quite poetic at times.Bringing this review to a smooth ending, I'm glad that I was able to rewind far back in cinema time to an early and landmark horror film. Avid horror fans will hopefully be able to appreciate "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", with is both simplistic and extravagant at the same time. Although I haven't seen too many silent films, I definitely think this is a great one, and is recommended for horror fans, especially those that want to watch a piece of horror history! Thanks for the time, and peace.

One of the seminal horror-comedy crossovers films of all time, "Return of the Living Dead" is one of, if not the, very first movie that takes the concept of a zombie film and adds humor to it. Movies such as "Dead Alive" and "Shaun of the Dead", both awesome movies, would take influence from this classic.Although there's no really scary moment in here, aside a few startling jumps towards the end, (and the real scary part is the underlying political statement at the end), this movie is full of zombie-related laughs that, any horror fan would love. Even though the central focus is the zombie comedy, there's lots of nudity and even some decent gore scenes in here! This is all-around strong, and will have you laughing all the way through the comedic scenes, staring at the nudity scenes and have your heart pumping during the bloodier scenes.Overall, this is definitely a horror-comedy classic that should be viewed by every horror fan that's full of great laughs, great characters and great quotes. Check it out in time for Halloween, too! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Here's one for the books! I find it interesting that a modern-day horror remake has gotten so many positive reviews, and I for one am happy! For I, too, think "The Hills Have Eyes" is an excellent modern-day horror movie! Early this past summer before I saw the movie, I watched a fan-made preview on Youtube and was stunned at the intensity and gore even in the preview! I knew I was in for something big when I got this.And wow, was I ever correct! "The Hills Have Eyes" is EXTREME and pushes the boundaries with visual shock. The mutants that live in the hills of the desert are all pretty terrifying and brutal, and there's LOTS of gore ALL throughout the movie.And that's one thing about this movie that I find really interesting: The fact that it can combine being really scary and MEGA gory at the same time! Most horror movies incline towards being really scary, but not having such an intense amount of gore, OR rely heavily on gore but not be as scary."The Hills Have Eyes" manages to be both really suspenseful and uber-bloody. The fact that the film-makers could find the perfect medium for the movie, and also maintain the awesome scenery and character development has thoroughly impressed me as a horror lover.Well, there's not much else to say here, other than this movie rocks! If you want a great horror movie, and one of the far better remakes of the last ten years, "The Hills Have Eyes" will have you glued to your couch! Thanks for the time, and peace.

That's what I saw on a music website. Well, it's a big question. Anyway, this is the 1967 debut Pink Floyd album, in a time when they were lead by the ingenious singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett, who, as you've probably already read, was doomed. But as for the present, he wrote some extremely trippy psychedelia!Now, you've probably heard descriptions of the album thoroughly enough before, so I'll just sum it up. If you love psychedelia, get this! It has something for everybody: "Astronomy Domine", a great opener and wild space rock track. If you want the trippiest, wild instrumental song that explores epic proportions, listen to "Interstellar Overdrive". And for everyone who loves scarecrows, there's the avant-garde esque "Scarecrow". The closing track, "Bike" is great, as well, but the second half of the track, filled with bike-reparing noises (using noises like these would be something the band would use a lot in a few years, especially on DSotM) is almost three and a half minutes long and can get quite annoying.Oh, and let me ask you this: Am I the only person who likes "Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk"? We all know it's Roger Waters' first composition, and sure, it sounds NOTHING like his future masterpieces, but this was when Floyd had a trippy, psychedelic sound. The lyrics are cool, the relatively long jam (long for a 3-minute song, at least) is filled with a cool bassline, great guitar work, and organ playing from Rick Wright that'll make you swear you're in space.Overall:This sounds nothing like later Pink Floyd, doesn't have David Gilmour, and, if you're used to Floyd's later and vastly popular material, then just remember to have an open mind while listening to it. This is their debut, and one of their greatest albums. Some songs are better than others, but lyrically and instrumentally, this album's worth it. So if you want more Pink Floyd, but still something different, this is definitely an album to consider!

Blink-182 is generally a love 'em or hate 'em band. If you love them, then you know how much fun they can be. If you hate them, then you're missing out on some great stuff. A lot of people may dispose the thought of listening to the band because of immature lyrics or other reasons, but honestly, there's so much to love here on "Enema of the State". The album is fast, energetic, riff-filled, funny, inspiring, melodic, and in-your-face. The guitar and bass are crisp and clear, with some awesome guitar riffs and basslines through the album. Then there's Travis Barker on the drums. Man, that drummer is just full of pure, unstoppable energy on the kit!It would be unfair if I built up the album so much and then left off without giving some insight as to WHY it's so great, so here's a run-through of most of the songs, which are personal highlights for me:"Dumpweed": A fast and frantic anthem about crazy girls with an awesome, pull-off guitar riff and breakneck drumming, where the verse sections and in-between sections alternate from moderately paced to quite fast-paced."Don't Leave Me": Another speedy, short song, this one about breakup instead. A great, skillfull guitar/drum combo with Mark belting out some great vocal melodies and lyrics."Aliens Exist": Another song that has the anthemic, energetic sounds of the Warped Tour, this one features Tom on vocals singing about aliens. Another energetic and funny song!"Going Away To College": A more serious, true-to-life song about missing a loved one as they go off to college, but more great instrumentation here."What's My Age Again?": A punk classic with some melodic guitar lines and very funny lyrics. A mid-paced song, but with a great, clean-guitar section in the middle."Dysentery Gary": Probably the most melodic song on the entire album, with great guitar lines, funny but jealousy-driven lyrics and awesome melody with a good pace, too."Adam's Song": A more balladic, introspective song that shows Blink-182 discussing more serious concerns of the real world. An overall gem of a punk ballad, truly one of the band's best songs."All The Small Things": Everybody knows this one! A steady beat, blaring guitars, funny lyrics and an infectiously catchy and memorable chorus."The Party Song": A very fast-paced, drum-driven song with great, highly amusing lyrics and more power chords that blast their way from Tom's guitar. A song you can listen to over and over."Anthem": More of Travis's great drumming here in this song about rebellion and the spirit of being a misfit in the modern world.As you can tell, those are the "highlights", and yet that's most of the album right there! "Enema of the State" is an album you can listen to all the way through and love every second of it, and at only about 36 minutes, you certainly won't get bored. If you want a fast and funny punk album by one of the world's best modern punk bands, you will hopefully soon consider this one of your favorite albums, as I already do! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Hatchet" is definitely one of the most talked-about horror movies of the past year or so, but not necessarily talked-about in a good way; this movie has recently become notorious for getting many mixed reactions. I myself even feel mixed about this movie. So the big question with "Hatchet" is this: WHY does this movie get so many mixed reactions?The biggest reason in my opinion is this: "Hatchet", as funny and gory as it is, suffers from being UNEVEN.I personally liked the movies because the first half was basically a comedy, and rather entertaining at that. The movie also has excellent gore, though the first three kills are a little hard for my eyes to watch. Anyway, I also think the characters of this movie are very true to life. I can really see myself and a friend of mine acting like Ben and Marcus, at least a little bit.So the humor, gore and characters are all strong points of "Hatchet", so why do people dislike it? I, like many other people, feel like this:Well, let me ask you this: Why did all the Friday the 13th and Halloween movies keep you entertained? They were consistent with the action, murders and plot! There would be a slower scene of people talking, then somebody goes off and gets killed. The pace picks up a bit, and the tension rises.With "Hatchet", everything occurs slowly, and basically saves most of the horror for the end. Don't get me wrong, that can definintely work in movies, just look at the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". They basically saved the scariest stuff for the last half-hour.But with "Hatchet", it's easy to get bored, frustrated or agitated at the movie because it's very inconsistent, and the characters are often getting angry or acting dumb...all right, never mind that last part, lots of characters make bad choices in slasher films, heh-heh.So what's the final verdict on "Hatchet"?:If you want a funny slasher-horror with lots of gore, RENT IT.If you want a short, easily digestable movie and have nothing better to do with your time, RENT IT.If you want a genius OR serious OR consistent horror movie, SKIP IT.If you want an original movie that breaks new ground, or it at least rather imaginative, SKIP IT.So "Hatchet" was good for a one-time view and I might search it again online and rewatch it sometime in the future. I can tell that they had lots of great ideas for this movie but unfortunately, all the good stuff as in funny scenes, gore shots and character development, was mixed with boring stuff, frustrating stuff, or just generally uninteresting scenes. Watch it if you like, but don't expect Victor Crowley to take Jason Voorhees's spotlight in the Slasher Hall of Fame! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Opeth is by far one of the best metal bands today, and of all time. They're also one of my favorites, and certainly one of the most interesting, deep, complex, brutal and yet beautiful bands you can find. All of those adjectives describing their sound are presnted here on "Orchid". This is the album that started them off. "Orchid", their debut album, began a dynasty of one of metal's best bands.Opeth is a band that may take some time to fully appreciate their songs. The songs are long, complex and may have hidden meanings in them that takes time to ponder. There also may be some passages that it may take several listenings to fully remember. Also, most Opeth material is best suited for listening to at night. There's something about listening to it then that just makes it even more amazing.All right, well that describes the band as a whole, but let me begin to describe "Orchid". Well, quite often the sound tends to vary on each Opeth album, and their first is no exception. Whereas they created a more death-metal sound on albums like "My Arms, Your Hearse" or "Still Life", "Orchid" is probably their most black-metal sounding album, if not tied with "Morningrise". As with all Opeth albums, there are still gentle acoustic passages and beautiful, cleaning singing, but "Orchid" has the buzzing, razorblade guitar sound of black metal, the atmosphere of it, and Mikael uses more of a black metal howl than a death metal growl."In Mist She Was Standing": A fourteen-minute opener in C minor, this song kicks off with victorious-sounding, galloping riffs that are reminiscent of a heavier Iron Maiden. The songs flows into Mikael's aggressive howling about venturing to find his true love and thick, melodic riffs. Ending with sadder, slower but still beautiful riffs, this song is quite the metal epic."Under A Weeping Moon": The only non-interlude song that's under 10 minutes, this song is less mournful-sounding than "In Mist She Was Standing", but just as intense and epic. A great follow-up song."Silhouette": A three-minute, piano masterpiece played entirely by drummer Anders Nordin, this shows what an astounding, classical pianist he is. A riveting and intense interlude."Forest of October": My favorite song on the album, if not tied with the next song, and just over 13 minutes. This song starts off with slow, melodic, heavy riffs similar to Black Sabbath. A sudden stop, then we go into black metal tremolo picking guitar riffs and incredibly fast, double-bass drumming. At around 2:40, a simplistic but amazingly beautiful, acoustic guitar comes in with more incredibly fast double-kick drums. Harmonized, minor-key riffs follow with two blazing, riveting guitar solos over the course of the song. In this one, Mikael speaks of being in a forest in darkness, being very introspective and wishing to be set free of whatever holds him back in that place. A masterpiece of a song."The Twilight Is My Robe": This song is tied with "Forest of October" as my favorite song on the album. Eleven minutes long and the least mournful of all the songs, this song just sounds the most straight-up vicious as opposed to sad. Written with a lot of progressive music influences, this is an early Opeth classic."Requiem": A beautiful piece with harmonized bass guitar and acoustic guitar lines."The Apostle In Triumph": The first minute-and-a-half of this song are actually where "Requiem" left off but was accidentally put onto this song, apparently, which is why there's a pause of about five seconds. This song does have more heavy, death-metal riffs but is also quite progressive. However, the acoustic passages here seem to be most noticeable. There's something about this song that seems a little odder than any of the other songs, but it's still a great track.Bonus Track:"Into The Frost of Winter": A six-and-a-half minute extra song, this one is by far the most black-metal out of all the songs. The howling, the guitar riffs, even the recording is like other black metal bands of the time. An interesting and enjoyable extra song.Having just gone through the entire album in written details, I hope I was informative and gave you a better idea about the sound of this album. For Opeth fans who don't have this yet, this is a highly recommended album. If you are a newcomer to Opeth, this is indeed a great album, but a better starting place would be "Blackwater Park" or "Still Life". However, no matter what you start with, I am of firm belief that this is one of the greatest and most unique metal albums of all time. Be sure to treasure this heavy, then soft, then heavy again, masterpiece! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Not a band that would desire to be categorized with the dozens of metalcore bands out there, Shadows Fall brings us a slab of hard-edged thrash with huge riffs, blazing solos, nice melodies and amazing, almost obscure lyrics. "The War Within" is a great album for fans of thrash metal and melodic death metal, and here are some of the highlights of the album."The Light That Blinds": As cliched as it may sound, this is probably my favorite Shadows Fall song. A beautiful, acoustic opening that swells into a guitar-sweeping madness, followed by beautiful, intense riffs, shouting vocals, another great solo and some awesome, mosh-able riffs. A true metal masterpiece."Enlightened By The Cold": A heavier, rawer and shorter song than the previous one, but great nonetheless. Catchy riffs and more great lyrics with a cool, brief solo."What Drives The Weak": The second big song off the album, with more heavy, driving riffs, a mellow pre-chorus and a fierce, catchy chorus. Another blazing guitar solo here with a great after-solo riff. One of the best songs off the album."Stillness": Like "The Light That Blinds", this one opens up with a softer, guitar intro before kicking off into another great mosh-rocker."The Power of One and I": One of the more brutal songs on the album with another sick chorus. Less melodic than say, "The Light That Blinds" but awesome song nonetheless."Ghost of Past Failures": More great riffs and obscure lyrics, but what makes this song so incredible is the chorus. There's something about the mysterious element to it that makes it the best chorus on the album.So to sum it up, this is a great metal album that all people wanting a break from the metalcore bands, but still want something mosh-able. By the way, I saw Shadows Fall open up for Avenged Sevenfold back in December, the Boston dudes put on the greatest hardcore show ever!!! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I don't think a movie has become such an "urban legend" or a "myth movie" as much as "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" has. Sure, there are legendary cult films like "Night of the Living Dead", "Eraserhead" and "Killer Klowns From Outer Space", but "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" has basically become the prototype for all the B-movie parodies on TV sketches, the basis for plots on your Saturday morning cartoons, and the definitive "everybody's heard about it, but only half the people have actually seen it" film.A lot of people would dismiss this film as being dumb, or a cheap rip-off parody, but if you've got a bit of cult-film love in your heart, are entertained by strange comedies and ever considered what would happen if your garden veggies imitated "Jaws" at one point or another (because that DID happen in this flick!), well then, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is on your vine. (Wow, I can't believe I said that!)For all cult-film lovers, this is an essential, just like "Night of the Living Dead" or "Airplane!" or any of the whacked-out foreign films you might love so much. So to anybody that's at least a little bit like me (Heaven forbid! haha) and interested in something unusual, musical and oddly humorous, this film will be awesome! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although I'm not usually one to jump on the bandwagon when a Hollywood remake of a horror film is made, my curiosity was sparked...well more like electrocuted, when I saw the trailer for this on the DVD for "Haunting in Connecticut". So what do I do? The only sensible thing! I buy it for myself to give it a good view. So what do I think of "My Bloody Valentine"?Well, the short version of my opinion would be that it's a great horror movie that really gives you the feel of the '80s classics, but also suffers from being too Hollywood. However, I wouldn't be doing my job as the horror aficionado I am without giving you all the whole enchilada. The positives about "My Bloody Valentine" are the positives of many classic slasher films: We have a sinister and seemingly indestructible villain who goes on a murderous rampage, lots of blood and gore throughout the movie, amazing special effects, a scene of ABSOLUTELY GRATUITIOUS nudity, a cool small-town setting and overall rather good acting.So indeed, "My Bloody Valentine" is an old-school, nuts-out slasher film extravaganza. The only thing I didn't really like about the film is that it became too "Hollywood" towards the end. The last scene kind of turned from old-school slasher horror to a more drama-thriller sort of affair. The ending is also debatable; watch it and you'll probably be like me, hoping that they better do a sequel the way it ended!Overall, this is for the most part a very good movie that could've had a less mainstream vibe to make it flawless, but the fact that there's a solid amount of special features, and that it comes in either 2-D or 3-D with four pairs of 3-D glasses makes me give it a five-star rating. Although it's a Valentine's Day related horror film, be sure to get this in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

What a great album. "The Art of Partying" is an embodiment of the loud-hard-fast party atmosphere of such bands as Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies, and other metal giants. Although this album is quite short and there's a lack of guitar solos, it does come chock full of complex, lightning-fast riffs, amazing drumming, energetic vocal performances over and over, and all the right lyrics, ranging from the more serious stuff in the veins of Megadeth and Overkill, to humorous topics (such as a personal favorite, "Headbanger Face Rip"). Again, it would have been nice to throw some blazing guitar solos in there, but this band, along with others such as Evile, Bonded By Blood and Fueled By Fire prove that thrash metal is still alive and well! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Among the seminal and influential horror films is "The Shining", which is an undisputed masterpiece, and one of the greatest psychological-horror movies of all time. Be it as lengthy as it is, "The Shining" is captivating in every second of its terrifying glory. I think one of the reasons "The Shining" is so influential is because throughout the entire movie, the characters are continually becoming developed. They grow and grow with each twist and turn of the series of events, and as the plot thickens, they still show signs of unfolding the layers of their persona.Another thing that makes "The Shining" such a great and influential horror movie is that it became one of the definitive movies where the location plays just as big a character role as the lead characters. In this case, The Overlook Hotel, which unfolds the dark and haunting mysteries of its twisted and murderous past, showcases that it plays just as big a role as Jack Nicholson or Shelly Duvall, both of whom are amazing actors here. The concept of the building playing a charater would later influence such great, modern-day psychological horror movies such as the great "Session 9"."The Shining" is a movie that gives a good reputation to horror, because it's one of those movies that you really have to watch a few times to truly pick up on everything thrown in your direction. I honestly didn't fully understand everything until the fourth time I saw it, and by then, the movie went from being a puzzling masterpiece to an utterly terrifying masterpiece! Watching it in the right mood, one can see why this movie made #6 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.However terrifying this movie may be, it is undoubtedly brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed. In addition to all of these positives, the scenery and atmosphere are incredible and quite surreal at times, making the movie even better. It's for these reasons that make it understandable why "The Shining" is one of those horror movies that even non-horror fans can really like.Another interesting thing about this movie is that it's not incredibly violent. Through the over two hours that this movie runs, there are only two kills. Although I do get a lot of enjoyment out of the gorier side of horror, I really like the fact that "The Shining" never became too graphic, because that would try to make the movie something that it's not. So bonus point for the movie staying true!Well, I know I built this movie up as much as a skyscraper, so I hope all readers out there really enjoy it! In short, if you're willing to watch a movie's that's quite long and progressive, but heightens in it's intensity and terror until the very end, "The Shining" will be a classic for you! Be sure not to hate on it until you've seen it a few times to better understand it, because if you're like me, by about the fourth time it'll have you terrified! Thanks for the time, and peace.

So as you may or may not know by now, Andrew W.K. doesn't have the most complex lyrics around, but for his style of music, it doesn't really matter. The only thing you need to think about when listening to him is that "It's time to paaaarty!". So yes, every song is an anthem about feeling good and partying hard. And it's all done to the music of simple but awesome keyboard melodies, frenzies guitar chords, stadium rock drums and masculine vocals. From the playfulness of the opener "It's Time To Party", to the blazing opening guitar solo in "She Is Beautiful", this album is a great summer party album! It's all melodic hard rock with lots of energy and fun, and to me, that beats out a double-meaning political song anyday, even though I'm quite the Liberal, but whatever. Get it, rock out, and, like Andrew W.K. would put it, party till you puke! Thanks for the time, and peace.

It took me a little while to "get" this album. There's something so surreal about "Passion and Warfare" that you just can't ignore it. The way it combines incredible instrumental work with the fact that the song were inspired by actual dreams of Steve Vai's is amazing. There is also an element of Frank Zappa's music in here. The connection Steve had to Zappa must have left an influence on the him and especially this album. Kind of reminds me of how I am with my guitar teacher: creative, artistically inclined and certainly out of the ordinary.The short description of this album would be that it's one of the greatest guitar-focused albums of all time that features cool basswork and powerful drumming. Instead, I'll give a more detailed review so people can better grasp this album."Liberty" is appropriately named, as it gives the album a majestic opener. "Erotic Nightmares" provides fascinating guitar soloing. "The Animal" combines a funk-metal guitar riff with some outsanding shredding in the mixolydian scale (technical talk that some people might not understand, but that's OK). "For The Love of God" is an extremely beautiful guitar solo in B minor, one of the best solos of all time. I mean, I could just feel the passion behind each and every note of this six-minute power ballad. It's one of those songs that puts you in a very unusual, but still very comfortable mood."The Audience Is Listening" is a rare treat. The song througout is very funny, literally almost like a musical comedy. The thrashy wah-riff combined with the hard-funk bassline adds for some great pieces remembered. Then of course are some more intensely beautiful guitar melodies in B minor which add a very lush and even sensuous tone to the song. The song ends in commotion, the way a rock performance at someone's school might. "Greasy Kid's Stuff" has an intro where Steve mentions the technical stuff behind the equipment and such, but the rest of the provides an energetic rocker that's very enjoyable, with the ending quote being, "And that's not just greasy kid's stuff!"."Answers" is another short piece that's still extremely loveable. That funky, surreal guitar riff combined with more, melodic soloing just makes for another, awesome song. "Ballerina" and "Alien Water Kiss" are both short songs with great melodies on a clean guitar tone that add a cool variety to the album.Overall, this is an amazing effort by Steve Vai. The whole atmosphere of it is truly unique and very "out there", if you will, but that's just what I love about it. What some people may describe as eccentric is pure pleasure for me. Additionally, it's presented in such a way that even if you're not a musician, you can still appreciate the album. Because of the epic tone that is often featured here (alongside some very funny moments), this is one of those albums that I wait until night time to listen to, but that's all right - that just makes the album feel more special to me.All right, so by now, you probably understand that I hold this album in high regards. If you are inspired to get it, please, definitely do! It's beautiful, powerful and different, and will certainly add variety to your collection. And as Steve said in "The Audience Is Listening": "I am the passion...I am the warfare". (just wanted to recall that moment!). Anyway, thanks for the time, and peace.

It's really rare that truly great music could ever break it into The Top 40, but Switchfoot seemed to have defied that with "The Beautiful Letdown". I got this at about the time it came out, a little over five years ago. Back then I enjoyed it quite a bit, but in between then and now, I've become a serious musician, albeit I'm still young, but have learned to enjoy this album tenfold more. Although the media loves to categorize bands, it's not that easy to define Switchfoot. On this album, they provide heavy guitar and drums that are reminiscent of Led Zeppelin, then go to acoustic guitars and industrial-sounding keyboards, then to a reggae vibe, and a mixture of even more. Read on to discover what a classic album this is."Meant To Live": A heavy, melodic guitar riff and groovy, hammering drums are featured throughout this song. A Switchfoot classic, with a huge-sounding, epic end."This Is Your Life": A beautiful, huge-sounding song that combines acoustic guitars with electronica-sounding keyboards. A steady, catchy pace with larger-than-life sounding choruses make this another classic."More Than Fine": Features an industrial-sounding beat with nice acoustic guitars, beautiful vocals and a positive vibe. A really beautiful and meaningful song, this one is really well-written."Ammunition": Starts off with a heavy drumbeat that always reminds me of Led Zeppelin. The throbbing bass comes in, then the guitars, which remind me a bit of The Police. This is a fast and energetic song in the punk vein, with quite social lyrics. Another perfect song!"Dare You To Move": Another one of Switchfoot's biggest songs, featuring a slow, graceful beat, and acoustic guitars that go to power-chord electric guitars in the chorus. Another song that shows their skill for crafting huge-sounding songs, and how great they sound!"Redemption": A shorter, faster song in the punk-sounding vein of "Ammunition", only this song's a little softer. I love the choruses in this song, they're lyrically positive and musically melodic."The Beautiful Letdown": The longest song on the album, with the lyrics being one of the big things here. Power-ballads reminiscent with a nice vibe to it."Gone": A personal favorite of mine, this one is a punkish song with a strong reggae influence. Again, the lyrics are crucial and go perfectly with the beat. A fun song and one you can listen to over and over!"On Fire": A beautiful and inspirational ballad featuring lovely piano work. This is one of the songs on the album that I haven't heard in a while, and the first time I re-listened to it recently, I almost went to tears! Truly a wonderful ballad, one of those to play at weddings!"Adding To The Noise": More industrial keyboards are featured here, and punk-metal guitar riffs are included, as well. A short, fun song that's got a steady beat and a good energy, another personal favorite of mine."Twenty-Four": A slower, reflective song that was written the night before one of the band members actually turned 24 years old. A nice way to close off a classic album.Having re-discovered this album, this is going to be a hot item in my player for some time! Switchfoot truly is a great band and this is one of the best rock albums of this decade. Very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

...the first words of the incredible, "You've Got Another Thing Coming". Words that everybody can relate to. And, of course, the rest of "Screaming for Vengeance" is just as great. This was one of the first heavy metal CDs I can remember buying, so it makes sense to me at least that I should share with the world my adoration for the classic, the timeless, "Screaming for Vengeance".Throughout their years, Judas Priest has experimented with progressive metal (which they practically invented with the early classic "Victim of Changes"), speed metal, power metal, NWOBHM, and guitar-synth hair metal (Turbo was virtually as good as Van Halen at their magnum opus!). It's no wonder that with all of this under their belt, and their seniority (KK Downing and Ian Hill founded Priest in '68 or '69), Judas Priest laid the groundwork for countless heavy metal hopefuls to follow. That, and the fact that the first ever dual-lead guitar factor of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton, along with Rob Halford's marvelous vocals (he's up there with Ozzy Osbourne, Bruce Dickinson and Ronnie James Dio as one of the greatest frontmen in heavy metal), these guys are in a class of their own.Now I will review my favorite tracks of "SFV". The first, four tracks are great enough as it is, and I'll get to that right now."The Hellion": A slow yet powerful introduction with a great riff. It has a kind of progressive energy that gets you ready for an excellent rocker."Electric Eye": A speedy, epic tune with a great vocal performance by Rob Halford and some blindingly amazing guitar work by KK and Gleen. The quick change at the bridge shows that progressive-styled music played a role in the band."Riding on the Wind": Love the energetic drum opening, followed by a fiery and lush guitar riff, along with Rob Halford's unstoppable falsetto wails. More great guitar soloing and this makes for a great cruising tune."Bloodstone": Great followup to "Riding on the Wind". The opening guitar riff is very New Wave of British Heavy Metal-styled. After that, the second lead guitar comes in and a funk-metal masterpiece is created. Of course, more soaring guitar soloing and Rob Halford's passionate vocal performance."Screaming For Vengeance": Very energetic song, with more soaring falsetto wails and a bit of noticeable progressive styling around the three-minute mark. Ends with a drone that goes into..."You've Got Another Thing Coming": The single off the album, which makes for a great, driving song. Rob Halford gives a dramatic, vocal performance and the guitar solo is very inspired.The rest of the songs are great, too, but like I previously stated, it's worth your money even for the first, four songs. I would probably put this as one of the ten greatest heavy metal albums, IMO. The selection is great and if you want an inspired, wonderfully-crafted and energetic heavy metal album, I'm almost certain you're gonna dig this one.

*exhales deeply* 20 horror reviews down, 11 to go before I reach my "31 reviews for 31 days of October" goal. With Halloween at the tail end, October is definitely the "month of horror" should there ever be one, and "The Birds" is a definite horror masterpiece. Although this movie is over 40 years old, watching it today, there really isn't any "dated" feel to it, unlike some other horror movies of the time (such as "Blood Feast", although that movie is still enjoyable B-movie gold)."The Birds" is full of suspense and a thickening plot, and is able to be a scary movie without relying heavily on the graphic side of horror, although I will admit there are a few scenes that were probably quite graphic for the mid '60s audience. However, this is certainly a movie that proves Alfred Hitchock the "Master of Suspense". The birds are the villain altogether, a miniature army like the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park". And that's one of the things that makes this such a great horror movie. Usually, there's only one villain in a horror movie, but "The Birds" is able to produce a countless amount of villains, in the flocks and flocks of angry birds! Even today, such a concept is rather rare, so for it's time, it was most certainly a visionary concept, I would assume!Although I'm probably a lot younger than most people familiar with this film, I still think "The Birds" is a suspenseful and brilliantly-done horror masterpiece. What it lacks in the gorier side of horror, it undoubtedly makes up for in the awesome writing of the film, and the all-around suspense. Highly recommended for all horror fans, especially in time for Halloween! Well, only ten more reviews to go before I reach my goal, time for a breather. Thanks for the time, and peace.

The title alone should suggest it. Demonic Toys. Taking place in a toy factory late at night and featuring such colorful villains as Baby Oopsy Daisy and Jack Attack, this movie delivers the goods. There are some great gore scenes throughout the movie which always adds points in horror films. The setting adds a classic spooky touch that adds to the effect of the movie (after all, setting is big in horror). We have comical characters that get developed throughout the movie. The really interesting thing is how there are several mini-plots that get kicked off at the beginning of the movie, and they all come together as the movie progresses. In a way, it's almost like the Seinfeld of horror movies in terms of the story-writing. There are a few jokes that bomb here and there, but overall this movie does an excellent job at combining humor with slapstick gore and fantasy terror. Oh, and who wouldn't want to see a horror film with imaginary girls in hazmat masks riding around on tricycles? Highly recommended! Thanks for the time and peace.

Well, considering it's the month of Halloween, I figure I better catch up on my horror reviews. "Creepshow" is an anthology movie from the genius minds of both Stephen King and George Romero, containing several horror-comedy episodes, all at around 20 minutes or so. To this day, such an idea hasn't been done that often, and considering how novel it was at the time it was made, Romero and King pull this off very well. All the stories are entertaining and chilling, and the last one, if you have insectophobia, will be quite a shocker! For a fun and chilling way to spend your Friday night, enter the Creepshow! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Red Hot Chili Peppers's 1999 album "Californication" is often recognized as one of their best efforts, often ranked second only to "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". And with that being said, "Californication" is great for both newcomers to the Peppers and fans who want to complete their RHCP collection.What I really love about this album is the summery feel to it. I remember finishing my finals early June, coming home and popping this in at 10:30 in the morning. The second I heard the chorus to "Around The World", I knew it was time for my summer soundtrack to return!The whole album is very strong and well put-together, and shows how far the guys in the band have come. The fifteen songs that make up "Californication" all flow nicely and sustain a level of energy, mood and high spirits we've come to know the Chili Peppers by. The songs combine funk, alternative rock, experimental rock, even some occasional bluesiness and heavy metal. Some highlights of the album include:"Around The World": A super-energetic introduction features a thundering bassline and some screeching, psychedelic guitar lines. The verses are very catchy, Anthony going about in his rap-rock styles, and the chorus is so melodic and beautiful, it sets the tone for the whole song."Parallel Universe": A basic but fast-paced song with a new-wave/punk guitar line and very atmospheric lyrics sung in Anthony's signature voice. A great chorus that builds up with lots of energy."Scar Tissue": A softer, melodic ballad with some jazzy rhythm section work and great, bluesy guitar lines. Anthony's lyrics and voice all add to the song, and overall this is one of the best songs by RHCP ever!"Emit Remmus": A jittery, low-key bassline and a slower pace occupy this song, which is apparently written about Anthony's relationship with the chick from the Spice Girls, read his autobiography "Scar Tissue" for more information. Anyway, the guitar in the chorus is very thrashy, in a good way, and the lyrics are odd and poetic, at the top of their game just like on the rest of the album."I Like Dirt": A short, funky two-and-a-half-minute jam in B-minor, featuring some deliciously double-entendre lyrics and a cool guitar solo."Road Trippin'": A mellow, acoustic ballad that closes off the album, Anthony's lyrics and singing as great as they always are.With all the other songs alongside these, "Californication" is one of the strongest album of the last 10 years, and ends the '90s with a bang. As a RHCP fan, I wholeheartedly recommend getting this as soon as possible, take a nice, long cruise down the highway near the foresty area not too far form your home, blast this, and feel it work its magic. It's worked for me, as I love this album, and I know you will, too. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Flight of the Living Dead" is a really fun, campy, entertaining zombie-horror film. There's lots of rapid-fire action scenes, explosive gore throughout the film, interesting and enticing character development, and some great slapstick humor to boot. Basically, this is everything beautiful about zombie exploitation with B-movie good-times and comedy thrown in for good measure. It takes a little bit for the movie to really kick off but once it does, the laughs, full-on gore and action don't stop! Highly recommended for zombie fans. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Iron Butterfly is one of the greatest forgotten bands. While there aren't a lot of songs on this album, and it only fills out a little over 36 minutes, it's well worth your money, even for the title track alone. The drumming is superb, the basslines are heavy, the guitar playing of 17-year-old Erik Braunn is excellent. The leader, church organist and lead singer, Doug Ingle really knows how to front the band. Each song is interesting and very enjoyable, especially the title track. And if you want a true landmark acid/hard rock album of the late 60s, this is your ticket to happiness.

There are so many things to love about Frank Zappa. Musically, he's extremely complex. He makes a lot of material by other bands appear really simple. That's not to say they're bad, but Zappa is a true visionary when it comes to musical complexity. I also love his use of satirical comedy in his lyrics. If I were to try to get deeply into that, it would be too complicated, so, I'll let you figure out what his lyrics mean to you. But as an explanatory to them, they're quite funny.This is one of Zappa's best works, and that's really saying something. Although I've seen the price for this one sometimes high, it's well worth it. "Sheik Yerbouti" has got something for everybody. "Rat Tomango" is a five-minute plus guitar solo with a good drum backbeat. For all guitarists and guitar enthusiasts, this is a must-own! Then, there are sing-a-long tunes that would make great pop singles, such as "I'm So Cute", a great, rapid song sung by Terry Bozzio with some rockin' guitar work, and "Tryin' To Grow A Chin", which opens with some unbelievably fast marimba work, features hilarious lyrics, and even features a rock musical sort of sing-a-long at the end! That certainly makes this album something to listen to. Also, you got "Whatever Happened To All The Fun In the World" and "Wait a Minute", a couple of 30-second clips, (featuring some use of instruments), that seem like the types of things I'd record on my cellphone.A lot of the songs on here also seem to be prime examples of Zappa in the progressive-rock subgenre. A good deal of songs, especially on the first half of the album, all rock pretty hard and assure you're in for a ball! And believe me, I would know. Probably the best way I personally enjoy this album is to sit in my room late at night on Friday and Saturday nights and just let this thing play out. And for being an eager, teenage musician, that's a great way to end a Friday night. The only problem on this album is that some of the drumwork isn't as audible as some other instruments. The only other thing that kinda gets to me is that all the songs flow into each other, which means you need to keep a bird's eye view on the time on your CD player. However, this album is a leviathan of fun and here are some of its best tracks, which also mean some of Zappa's best works:"Broken Hearts Are For ***Holes": Hilarious lyrics that perfectly accompany the hard-rockin' sound of the music. You even get a bit of proto-80's synthesizer on this one! How cool."I'm So Cute": More great lyrics that fit the fast pace and Bozzio's voice. However, it gets a little repetitive at the end."Rat Tomango": Like I've already stated, this is an outstanding guitar solo that you just need to listen to."Bobby Brown Goes Down": A lot of people are probably aware about this song. In its day, and still today, the lyrics are considered very raunchy and explicit, due to Zappa's awareness of the mentality of our culture at the time, but it's still really funny. Ironically, this is set to a tempo of a song you'd slow dance to."Rubber Shirt": One heck of a bass solo."The Sheik Yerbouti Tango": Another great guitar solo, even if it's a little shorter than "Rat Tomango"."Baby Snakes": It's less than two minutes, but it's got something for everybody and really shines."Tryin' To Grow A Chin": Like I said a little before, this would make for a great pop single. The musical-like sing-a-long towards the end is one of the greatest moments on the entire album!"Dancin' fool": Another really fun and rhythmically complex song that adds lighthearted satire to the culture at the time."Jewish Princess": Again, really explicit lyrics that you can't help but laugh to. Shows you that the second side of this disc is just as good as the first."City of Tiny Lites": A great reason to listen to this one late at night. Easily a great Zappa-styled arena-rocker."Yo' Mama": Very long, at twelve and a half minutes. This is probably the only one where I don't particulary care for the lyrics, and the melody makes this one sound sad. However, the middle is good and I love at the end how he says each of his bandmates' names.Overall:If you want to get into Zappa, you NEED to own this! A whole lot of fun to listen to, a whole lot to keep a musician impressed and satisfied, and, of course, your and my soundtrack to a late Friday night. I really hope you enjoy this one, 'cause it's one great work of Zappa's art!

"Shenanigans" collects 14 Green Day rarities, B-sides and covers, and is able to put them all together in under 34 minutes. Yes this is a short album, but it's another awesome burst of Green Day, and the fact that I picked it up for all of 7 dollars gives me no reason to complain.Among these songs as the fast-paced, country-influenced and quite funny "Don't Wann Fall In Love", the instrumental "Espionage" which could very well be the theme to a spy show on TV, the loud, in-your-face "I Wanna Be On TV" which is reminiscent of classic Ramones and Sex Pistols, and a cover of both the Ramones "Outsider", and the Kinks' "Tired Of Waiting For You", both of which are great covers.Well, there's not much else to say here, the music is great and inside the booklet we get more amusing pictures of the band in their...well, shenanigans! Be sure to pick this up if you want more great Green Day. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I normally write long, progressive reviews, but considering who I'm reviewing, I'll make this short and sweet.Different people will say different things about "1". Some will say it needs the more cult classics of songs such as "Strawberry Fields Forever", or "I Am The Walrus", but "1" reflects the more pop side of the Beatles. It shows how they dominated the American and English charts in their time. In addition, just the fact that they can put 27 songs on one disc makes me happy.Opinions aside, this is the greatest rock and roll ever. What more can there be said? The Beatles = Timeless music. 1 = Five-star album for me. Thanks for the time, and peace.

This and "Black Sails in the Sunset" were the first two AFI releases I got, at the same time I might add. Although this EP is only 13 minutes long, it's a small testament as to why AFI is one of the best punk bands around today."Fall Children": A slow guitar intro starts us off, kicking into one of the fastest and most energetic hardcore-punk Halloween anthems around! Great lyrics and musicianship to boot, plus there's a slow part that slow descends into Davey screaming "FALL CHILLLL-DREN!", and kicking back into the chorus! An absolute classic! 10/10"Halloween": A great cover of the Misfits classic, the guitar riffs are top-notch and Davey's vocals are amazing, as well. The only thing that ruins this song is the 2 minutes of noises at the end. Just skip to the next track at the 1:42 mark! 9/10"The Boy Who Destroyed The World": The first song I ever heard from AFI, which made me fall in love with them, so this song is very special to me! Lots of energy and musicianship in this fast-paced number, that slows down towards the end and ends with the sound of a raining thunderstorm. Epic! 10/10"Total Immortal": A catchy, anthemic closer of a song, full of classic AFI hardcore energy, lyrics and attitude. A perfect way to close this Halloween EP! 10/10So, even though this release is as short as it is, it's still an amazing release by an amazing band! And don't forget to blast this just in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I have some pleasant memories of "The Prowler" (yeah, there's a sentence that makes me sound insane!). A year ago when I started renting DVDs from the great rental store a town or so over from me, I caught glimpse of this movie. Having positive critical praise on the cover and seeing how Tom Savini did the special effects (a VERY good thing, mind you!), I decided to check it out.Sure enough, I liked "The Prowler" so much that I decided to watch it twice in my rental period! I usually don't do that with movies, so I knew this one was a gem. Well, a week ago I re-rented it for a night of blood and terror (right after watching "The Burning", which is a great slasher by the way) so sure enough, I saw "The Prowler" for the third time.BUT WAIT! There was something about watching it the third time that left me less satisfied than when I saw it the first and second times. I'm not entirely sure what it was. The gore level is extreme and always enjoyable, the spooks where the killer jumps out of nowhere all give you a shock, and the chase scenes are highly thrilling and entertaining. So, this movie definintely has a lot of the positives of a great slasher film, but why was this movie not as awesome as I remembered?Now that I think about it, the pacing of this movie isn't the best. I mean, the time seemed to go be pretty quickly when watching this movie, but in between all the major events, not a whole lot happened. The thing with "The Prowler" is that all the strong points of this movie that I mentioned are great, but anything that isn't stand-out about this movie is kinda dull.I definitely would have given this movie a full five-star rating had it not been for the slower scenes in between what were great highlights of the movie. I'm still giving it a great four-star rating because "The Prowler" is still a very good slasher film with some nice extras, it's just that it wears thin after a bit. Ahh memories, memories. Next thing you know I'll be revisiting Dario Argento's "Opera" or Lucio Fulci's "City of the Living Dead", both of which I own, but "Opera" is by far the better of the two! Anyway, definitely give "The Prowler" at least one watch, because that alone is worth it! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Yeah yeah, how many times have you heard that this is the umpteenth Greatest Hits album from Aerosmith? Well just ignore that stuff, and listen to me: THIS is the album to get if you want to get a whole lotta music from the band. I just discovered it about a month ago and it's got me spinning around! I'm honest, this is the definitive Aerosmith collection...possibly. It's got a good dose of their early stuff, then it skips to their late 80s tracks (thanks to countless other ''Greatest Hits'' and ''Live'' albums), but it's all right.Let me start my review: It bursts open with Mama Kin and Aerosmith's gritty but talented blues-based hard rock. And it bursts even further with power ballads such as ''Dream On'', and ''Seasons of Wither'', (thought you might also be able to call it an epic), and other hard-rocking classics such as ''Same Old Song and Dance'', ''Back in the Saddle'', and ''Dude (Looks Like a Lady)''. And it's not even that that makes the album worthwhile (I haven't even gotten to the second CD). ''Love in an Elevator'' is a wonderful rocker and actually sounds a bit like a Def Leppard anthem. Cool!Now we cross over to the other side, where Aerosmith is living on the edge (two of the opening tracks). I don't listen to this disc as much as I do the first one, but it's worth every, single penny!!! We got some great rockers (Livin' On The Edge) and some beautiful ballads in the same class as Kiss's ''Beth'' and Guns n' Roses ''Sweet Child o' Mine'', in this case, it would be songs such as ''Deuces Are Wild'' and ''I Don't Want To Miss A Thing''. Great stuff! We also got some of the most recent tracks, including, ''Jaded'', ''Just Push Play'', ''Girls of Summer'', and ''Lay it Down''. All are good, but the two ending tracks sound kind of similar. But they're still great!Oh yeah, and they team up with Run-D.M.C. to do a cover of ''Walk This Way'', (The original version is one of the greatest tracks on the entire collection!Conclusion: One of the greatest ways to get into Aerosmith, but if you just got a big paycheck, you might wanna get the first, several albums. But hey, don't let me tell you what to do. This is the only Aerosmith album I have, so you don't have to listen to me. But if you want to get into Aerosmith and only want ONE compilation that's TOTALLY worth your money, it might be a good idea to check this out. Thanks for the time. :-)

I actually got this on a four-disc item called "Blood Bath", and that's comparatively A LOT less than what this DVD goes for. But anyway, to the film..."Devil's Nightmare" is a gothic horror film from the early '70s and takes the concept of people that each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins, puts them in an atmospheric, spooky castle, and ultimately presents a dark and mysterious, very dream-like mood throughout. After seeing the film, I had mixed feeling, although I kept in mind that compared to some of the stuff I've seen, it's really not bad. In fact, "Devil's Nightmare" is not a bad film by any means, it's just really easy to trash a movie where not a whole lot happens in the first hour. I know a lot of old-school horror movie save up the biggest suspense for the last 15 minutes or so, but I felt as though "Devil's Nightmare" could've had a little more suspense throughout the first 50 minutes or so (although there is a HOT lesbian scene not too far into the film).As I said, most of the biggest stuff takes place within the last half-hour or so, and that seriously gives an exciting kick to the movie. However, I did feel the very last scene was unnecessary, taking what could have been a perfect suitable happy ending and giving it a random downer of an ending for no reason. This definitely helped take away a star from the movie, because for me, a good ending can be what seperates a four-star film from a five-star film.However, keep in mind all the good this movie has going for it. A dreamlike setting, a dark and mysterious atmosphere, some awesome death scenes and of course that hot lesbian scene. Overall, it's definitely not a perfect film but if you're in the mood for something with atmosphere and also some good kills, "Devil's Nightmare" should serve as an interesting and enjoyable view.NOTE!!! The film opens up with an eight-minute introduction that has absolutely NO place in this movie whatsoever, BUT it's one of the greatest horror-related things I've seen in a while. A hot vampire lady in black? Her naked, crawling hot cannibal twin sisters? Biting each other's necks and spilling lots of blood? An altar with snakes on it? Some of the cheapest camera work I've ever seen? GENIUS! I wanna see a film with these lovely, twisted ladies in it! For whatever reason they talk about cannibal films, even though "Devil's Nightmare" is gothic horror, but I mean COME ON! How can any sane horror lover not totally dig this introduction?Well, that's about it for this review. I'm gonna try to get 31 horror movie reviews in, one for each day of October until Halloween. If you come across this movie, try to check it out, because it's definitely a film you'll remember for a long time. As for me, I'm off to find a trio of cannibalistic vampire hotties and write a B-movie script for them! Thanks for the time, and peace.

What's not to love about this album? It's got everything I believe melodic power metal should have: Super-fast drums, gorgeous and mystical keyboard lines, guitar work full of fast power chords and melodic, blazing solos, and fantastic, soaring vocals. These guys are very talented musicians and they make some fun and excitings songs for any fan of melodic metal. Give it a spin! Thanks for the time, and peace.

If you are looking to push the boundaries, break new ground, and have your jaw drop to the Equator, then Exhumed's "Gore Metal" is definitely the way to go. These guys are like Slayer on ten cups of coffee, downtuned to B-standard and on a low-budget, B-film horror movie binge. Bludgeoning and lightning-fast drums, super-distorted bass to bring in a gigantic, full-sounding low section, and guitars that grind, crush, blast, shred, warp and smoke all throughout! As musicians, they are great, this controlled chaos is something to behold. The term "extreme" is definitely one to describe this band: They are one of the heaviest and most intense bands I've ever listened to, right up there with Cannibal Corpse, Meshuggah, The Berzerker, Sleep, Behemoth, you get the idea. Overall, this is a great metal album, a true underground classic that should be enjoyed by all metalheads! Just don't bang your head too hard to these 200 BPM song tempos, but other than that, you should be doing great. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Like many other reviewers/fans, I believe that the third season of Seinfeld was definitely a head above the first and second seasons. Of course, there some great shows in those two seasons, but Season 3 is really the time when the show defined itself and started to perfect its elements. They found their comfort zone for plots, jokes and even some experimentation, such as an episode taking place outside the usual realm of location ("The Parking Garage", "The Subway" and "The Limo" all come to mind).Some of my all-time favorite Seinfeld episode are from this season. I loved "The Parking Garage" because it was able to take such a minimalistic idea and make an entire episode out of it. "The Pen" builds up to a hilarious climax where Elaine gets high off painkillers and Jerry's eyes get discolored from diving, forcing him to awkwardly wear sunglasses to a party. Then of course, the first time I saw "The Limo", I was truly taken by surprise and absolutely had to know how it ended, and what an ending!There were also some episodes that took unusual elements and made them strangely charming. One example is in "The Dog" where Jerry has to watch a dog while his braindead drunkard owner (who's very funny during his onscreen time!), is at a hospital halfway across the country. "The Subway" is able to construct and execute four totally different plots, one for each of the characters, until all is brought to a head in the Restaurant at the end.Overall, this collection brings together some of the greatest and most interesting Seinfeld episodes in the show's run. Add to the four discs all the extra features, and this is a purchase worth every last cent. Buy it and spend countless hours enjoying it! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Sometimes, you will listen to a really great album, then when you're done listening, you'll wonder, "Wow, that was great! How do those guys write songs like that?". That may be a question to ponder about Daft Punk. While their music contains an element of minimalism (and there's nothing wrong with that), there's just something about their songwriting that captures me. Now for those of you that haven't read any of my other reviews, I listen to a wide variety of music (which is not only fun for me, but a great thing to do as I am a musician and should gather aspects from various forms of music), and no matter what, I think that Daft Punk's, "Discovery" has something for everybody.I bought this album when it first came out. Granted, I was younger than and, like my other friends that loved Daft Punk, I thought of it as very entertaining. However, I still do now, and I love these guys even more for their talent and creativity."One More Time": A great way to start off the album, this song being just about infectious as you can imagine. I love that mystical, spacey break in the middle with just a swirling synth note and Romanthony's digital voice. This is endless fun and I'm sure you'll love it."Aerodynamic": The energy that this song displays lets you know that it's all right for you to let loose, as well. The speedy riff and Yngwie Malmsteen-esque guitar solo make this another great song. As a guitarist and guitar aficianado, this is especially a great song."Digital Love": Picks off right where "Aerodynamic" left off, with the ringing bell, progressing into a lush riff and lyrics that kind of remind me of those arena rock/hair metal ballads of the '70s and '80s. This a very beautiful, happy, and overall wonderful song that will leave you feeling great. And you gotta give it up for the outstanding guitar solo! I printed the tab for it and am currently trying to perfect it, even if it takes some time. Great song and an essential part of the album."Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger": Definitely a great song, and the interesting part of this song is the lyrical flow. At first, they seem to be just short passages of words, but eventually flow into each other to create one awesome groove, complimented by the cool, digital vocals. Believe me, you'll love this song."Crescendolls": A funny keyboard line that I would probably wanna learn (yeah, I'm a keyboardist, too!), and a crowd shouting things like, "Hey!", and "Whoo!". Just goes to show how good Daft Punk will make you feel."Nightvision": Bring out your lover, it's time for a love-making session! Love the airy synths on here and the electronic percussion. As one reviewer previously started, this is quite a sexy number. "Nightvision" makes for a great love-making song, but then again, the whole album ironically does. Just another thing to love about "Discovery"!"Superheroes": Starts off with some snare drumming, then a heavy, throbbing bass drum, and some vocals that seem to be purposely recorded backwards. Love the keyboard work here, this would be another song I would wanna learn on my keyboard. This song basically displays the aura of "superheroes" as best as possible in four minutes. From the previously mentioned, heroic vocals, keyboard work, and the sexy, feminine vocals, this is one awesome song!"High Life": Don't really listen to this song much, but it has more feminine vocals, if I recall correctly."Something About Us": A very romantic song with lyrics that could be used as words in a movie with a dramatic romance scene. The interesting part of this song that should be noted is the gutteral bass and keyboard combo. Very interesting, although somewhat unusual, it works."Voyager": Man alive, these guys can do it all! In just 3:45, Daft Punk combines funky guitars, throbbing basses, danceable drumbeats and techno keyboards into a fantastic, epic, spacey and just about perfect tune! This takes me on a space voyage, and always makes me think of just drifting out in the distant galaxy. You're gonna love this one!"Veridis Quo": Don't really listen to this song as much as some others, either, but it's got some nice flute work."Short Circuit": The first minute and a half is all right, but the rest of the song kinda declines from there. Don't worry, the first, 90 seconds is enough, as it's got some amazing electronic keyboard usage. The main riff is kind of goofy, but enjoyable, and the soloing is quite on the freaky-naughty make-out side of things. Very cool."Face To Face": I love the guitar riff, and the opening drum rhythm really works. More purposely recorded backwards vocals are here, along with some interesting lyrics that could mean a lot of things, depending on where you stand. If you listen closely enough, you'll hear distant, background violins in the second use of the chorus in this song. It just adds a lot of meaning to this song and along with the rest of it, it's just so good."Too Long": Aptly titled name, with this song being at ten minutes, but it's terrific nevertheless. This song has probably the most vocal usage of all the songs, I love how it becomes muffled towards the end and adds pumping, keyboard lines.Overall:This album has something for everybody, with its fourteen songs running at about 61 minutes. I still listen to it and am really glad that I got it. This would make a great album to listen to while cruising in the nighttime, chilling out in your room, or makin' love with your lover. It's great for all of these things, and I hope it makes a great addition to your musical library. See you later!

The first time I heard about Necrophagist was in a music theory class I took a while ago. A student made a reference to this band, and described them as being, "this insane metal band, that's one of [another student]'s favorite bands!". Well, that got me interested enough, and all I can say is...WOW!First off, if you're a musician and you're into metal music, this is ESSENTIAL. It doesn't matter if half the population never heard of this band, or if 99% of mainstream society will dig this or not. Necrophagist is an absolutely stunning band (well actually, Muhammed Suicmez is basically the sole performer on this album), but regardless, it is extremely technical.Between the death growls, blindingly fast arpeggios, crushing riffs and lightning-quick blast beats, this album delivers. Even within the first two minutes, the album's opener, "Foul Body Autopsy" shows you that Muhammed is one serious musician. And with such technical song titles like, "Intestinal Incubation", "Culinary Hyperversity" and "Fermented Offal Discharge" (a personal favorite song title of mine), you can almost guarantee before you even listen to this how amazing it will be. Fans of technical death metal are gonna dig this one. So, whether you use Limewire or go to the music store down the road, this is one for all extreme metal fans, and especially for all musicians! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Ashes of the Wake" really shows Lamb of God perfecting their style of extreme metal and showcasing their maturing and excellent songwriting. Throughout this mammoth of a thrash-metal album, we get huge heavy complex guitar riffs, Randy's trademark growls and spoken-word parts, harmonized guitar lines and jaw-droppingly awesome drum work, with everything from insane double bass, razor-sharp triplets and use of every piece of the kit.The standout songs are "Laid to Rest", "Now You've Got Something to Die For", "Omerta", and "Ashes of the Wake", although every song on this album showcases Lamb of God at the peak of their game.This band reminds me a lot of a new-found Pantera, although with twice the technicality and still maintaining just as much intensity. So if you want a brutal, complex and catchy album that'll be in your player for a long time, definitely for go "Ashes of the Wake!".Oh by the way, guitar gods Chris Poland and Alex Skolnick do two amazing guest guitar solos on "Ashes of the Wake", something not to miss! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Night of the Demons" is all that you've heard it was. A bunch of teenagers go to an abandoned haunted house on Halloween, laced with '80s metal, profanity, booze, costumes and sexual indulgence, and are in for a night of supernatural terror soaked in blood! From the deliciously enticing Angela to the slapstick humor to the spiritual/supernatural/semi-mythological element, this movie is all that and a bag of severed human heads! For fans of fun, campy, creative horror films, this is a definite essential. Thanks for the time and peace.

"Visions" is the first album by Stratovarius that I got, and honestly, it's a great one. I wish more bands like these would get popular here in the States, but regardless, "Visions" is a great metal album.Highlights for me include the majestic, slow-paced "The Kiss of Judas", the high-speed, guitar-and-keyboard madness of "Black Diamond", the riff-heavy, super-melodic "Forever Free", the hauntingly beautiful acoustic ballad "Before The Winter", and the headbanger-masterpiece "Legions". Of course, the other five songs on here are great as well. In fact, each of the ten songs show off the incredible musical and vocal talents the band has to offer, along with a mystical and somewhat yearning vibe demonstrated through the vocals and lyrics. Overall, it's a feast for the ears that shows it's a perfect balance of heaviness, softness, melody and aggression.In a time when drop C-tuning and breakdowns are the stereotype of metal music, this album is able to separate itself from the crowd and stay true to the beauty of power metal. Highly recommended for fans of the power metal subgenre. Keep rockin'! Thanks for the time, and peace.

This calls for another song, like in my "Machine Girl" review!!! This time, sing to the tune of "Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory":My eyes have seen the glory of the gore inside "Inside"Even though the jugs and booty they have thus chosen to hideThere's no nudity, but all the same, this flick has lots of goreIt has won over my heart.(drum fill)There's a pregnant babe alone on Christmas Eve and due next dayA gorgeous freak who wants to take her unborn child awayThere is violence with scissors, guns and even a hair dryerThis film will blow your mind!(another drum fill)There's a car of cops who all get killed in a bloody, ol' displayAnd a criminal who also gets wasted before the dawn of dayThe foxy murderer just won't give up, but you ask why?She explains in the end.(yet another drum fill)The heroine is stuck covered in gore in her bathroomThe angel of her death attempts to open the door to doomAnd in only 80 minutes, this film will knock you off your feetThis bloodbath's really neat.Well, I hope you win the war that's fought between seeing this movie or not. I'm against the war, in fact, my Dad even protested Vietnam about a dozen times, so when it comes to "Inside", there should be no inner war as to see it or not! CHECK THIS MOVIE TODAY!!! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Some bands have become successful by sticking to one formula and using it with each album, because they have a certain sound you can never really tire of. Green Day is essentially one of those bands, but on "Nimrod" they really show how great they can sound by spicing up their songs with different sounds.Of course we have timeless Green Day anthems like "Nice Guys Finish Last", "The Grouch" and "Prosthetic Head", but then we get to other great songs on the album. There's a cool little violin intro on "Hitchin' A Ride" which is a super-sexy swinging anthem about drinking. Then we have the classic, acoustic ballad of "Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)". Nothing really needs to be said about that song because basically everybody knows it. But THEN we get a real treat, the instrumental, hypnotic, three-minute "Last Ride In". It's got such a late-night, relaxed California sound to it, it's dazzling.Well that's basically a brief run-through of some of the songs. Honestly, all the songs on here are really good and I definitely recommend getting this album for more great Green Day. Plus, it'll give you a chance to hear how they can experiment and still maintain their classic sound. Thanks for the time, and peace!

The problem with pop music is that it has to fit in with certain rules and guidelines; if something isn't marketable, it's not deemed "pop worthy". And usually, the sort of music that can't be marketed as pop music is the most interesting music, and certainly music in its truest form.Frank Zappa is the first person that comes to mind with this being said. The great thing about Zappa is that he played the kind of music that he wanted and didn't worry about fitting in with the pop mainstream, which is something I love. I think when music comes directly from your gut and you do what you want without worrying about how the mainstream will take it, THAT is music in its purest and most honest form...and the same can be said for "Weasels Ripped My Flesh".From the controlled madness of the free-form jazz-fusion of "Didja Get Any Onya?" to the guitar-based "My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama", to everything in between, this is music with no boundaries or limitations. Instead, this is an album where anything goes, the rulebook is thrown out the window. (Actually, this can be considered the starting point for avant-garde music with what I just said being taken into consideration). But overall, this is one of Zappa's wildest and greatest albums. All Zappa fans are sure to love this one, and for those getting into Zappa, get ready for a wild ride with this one! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Just when I thought I heard it all, I randomly came across Aborted. These guys caught my interest because of their combination of both melodic- and brutal-death metal with grindcore, forming an unusual but noteworthy array of melodic deathgrind. This album is like a pure machine of metal adrenaline. Punishing blast beats, inhuman vocals that never once lose their zing, and guitars that range from going to a crushing buzz of gory pulsation to a darkly melodic, memorable and sometimes even catchy vibe almost. This band reminds me a lot of Exhumed, which is what initially attracted me to them, so if you want an adrenalized blast of energetic deathgrind that will have you headbanging all the way home, check these guys out! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Getting this in a four-movie pack, this was the first of the four I watched. "Kill Baby, Kill", although should have a more suitable name, is a great gothic-horror movie taking place in Italy and featuring some very interesting characters. At first I was skeptical about the movie after seeing that the title didn't even fully fit on the screen, which is one of the signs of a cheesy, throwaway movie. HOWEVER! I found that "Kill Baby, Kill" was indeed quite an enjoyable atmospheric horror movie.Although it's rather short compared to more recent horror movies, running at a little under 85 minutes, "Kill Baby, Kill" has quite a few highlights that'll make it worth your viewing experience. The stand-outs are, in my opinion:1) The sexy lady that conjours magic spells and conjurations, and is dressed all in black. Right from there, the movie-makers got my attention and did something right...very right!2) The creepy, mysterious little girl that seems to be the chase throughout the whole movie. She makes for an entertaining little misfit, especially watching the protagonist in search of her.3) The super-awesome, uber-trippy dream sequence that features some of the best psychedelic scenery I've seen in horror movies! A scene like this seems rather rare in more popular horror films, but when it's done right, it makes for quite the enjoyable spectacle.4) A happy and even heroic sort of ending that leaves you feeling satisfied. It's not all the time a horror movie has an ending that leaves you feeling satisfied with how the creators chose to end it, but "Kill Baby, Kill" has the sort of ending that leaves you feeling complete.All in all, yes this is a dated movie, but "Kill Baby, Kill" is a gothic-horror masterpiece and, especially in this day and age, a rare novelty that should be enjoyed by all horror fans. Buy it, hit the lights, and get ready for a hot, black-magic lady and some surreal, gothic images you won't soon forget! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I wonder what would have happened if Metallica stayed in the direction they were going with "...And Justice For All". It was certainly their most complex and layered album, and that's one of the reasons I really like it. But you've got to wonder just how impossible the song structures would have been on this album if they didn't decide to take a breather. I read one that Kirk Hammett said that the songs were "just too long", and I would imagine very complex. If "The Black Album" were any more layered and difficult to play, it might even send guys like Dream Theater or Symphony X spinning around their stack of Marshall amps!It's interesting, though, to see that "The Black Album" is generally regarded as the decline of Metallica. Ironically enough, I've looked over the reviews and it seems as though plenty of people still really like this album. That gives me some relief, because I, too, agree that there's nothing wrong with "The Black Album".True, Metallica stranded away from their faster, and occasionally more epic thrash metal, but the "semi-new sound" on this album doesn't bother me. In fact, lots of times when a band experiments around it doesn't bother me. What matters is the decency of the songwriting, and yes, "The Black Album" is full of great songwriting, talent and fun, along with a still-thrashy appeal."Enter Sandman" starts things off with a famous guitar riff and the horror-theme lyrics. A great guitar solo is included along with an awesome, shout-a-long chorus."Sad But True" is a slower, heavier song that's in the vein of bands like Pantera and Soundgarden. A catchy and somewhat melodic riff chugs and stomps its way through with more great verses and choruses."Holier Than Thou" is a faster-paced, more upbeat and a bit more progressive song than the previous two, with a chorus that'll replay itself in your head for a long time."The Unforgiven" is along the epic ballad lines of "Sanitarium", "Fade to Black" and "One", only instead, the verses are heavy and the chorus is balladic. Interesting twist, indeed."Wherever I May Roam" is a lengthy, epic mid-paced song with a foreign sounding guitar riff that sets a late-night atmosphere. Very cool and adventurous lyrics accompany, as well."Don't Tread On Me" has a staccato sort of march to it with more chugging guitar riffs and pounding drums."Through the Never" has more adventurous, epic lyrics, and even though I haven't listened to this particular song in a while, it's definitely up to par with the other songs here."Nothing Else Matters" is a beautiful ballad with great guitar work, orchestration and singing, and it's probably one of Metallica's most famous songs."Of Wolf and Man" has a sort of swashbuckling, on-a-ship feel to it with more great guitar riffs and some of James's best singing around."The God That Failed" features downtuned guitars, and James's frustration with the death of his mother. You can even tell from the melody of the song the anger and sadness from his personal loss. I imagine this song must have been hard for him to write."My Friend of Misery" is the longest song on the album, at almost seven minutes, and features *gasp!* basswork by Jason Newsted! Haha, but yeah, this is another solid song."The Struggle Within" is one of my favorite songs on the entire album. It's got a lengthy, larger-than-life epic opener and fast guitar riffs, along with an awesome, lengthy guitar solos, and the rhythm and groove from the verses and chorus make it absolutely awesome.So even though this isn't Metallica's Number One greatest album, it's still high up there. The overall feel of the album is heavy, fun, epic, fist-pumping, occasionally dark, and overall excellent. I'd recommend this to all metal fans and rock fans, as it is a classic. Let's hope Metallica's upcoming studio album is just as great! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Entombed's "Left Hand Path" is probably their most recognized album, and for a good reason. Everything about this album is great: fast, brutal, melodic riffs; sinister, demonic vocals; relentless, pounding drumming; and quintessential Scandinavian-styled death-metal lyrics. These guys are very talented as musicians and songwriters, there's not a single bad track on this album. In addition, this album is years ahead of its time. 1990? Are you kidding me? You could show this album to somebody and convince them that it was just released a year or two ago. Oh yeah, and the title track is one of the best dark, mystical Scandinavian metal songs ever recorded! These guys were way ahead of their time with this album, so be sure to check this out soon! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Sleep's Holy Mountain is generally considered one of the cornerstone's in stoner rock/metal. Now of course, you don't need to be a stoner to enjoy this music, and in fact, Sleep made quite an impressive album here. As a musician who loves improvisation, I enjoy the jamming that the power trio does throughout the album. Songs such as "Evil Gypsy/Solomon's Theme" and "Holy Mountain" showcase their skillful, sludgy jamming. Also, we have some nice bluegrass guitar on "Some Grass", and the opener "Dragonaut" has, let's be honest, probably one of the sexiest grooves ever for a metal song!Sleep reminds me a lot of Black Sabbath, but with usually gruffer, but understandable, vocals. The lyrics are first-rate, delving deeply into fantasy as you can get, and the music sets the perfect mood for it. Overall, this is definitely a classic album that may be hard to obtain, but well worth the effort. I find myself listening to it over and over again. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits" collects 30 great Ramones songs and puts them all on one disc. For the amount of songs and the price, this is an awesome purchase. Each song is great, and the liner notes inside the booklet are also very interesting. Although this compilation comes highly recommended, the dual-dusc "Hey! Ho! Let's Go! The Anthology", offers many more songs, so if that collection is in your price range, get that instead. But for a single-disc collection, this is the way to go. So as the Ramones said, "Hey! Ho! Let's Go!". Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although "Dookie" is always considered the best Green Day album, to me "Insomiac" is DEFINITELY just as good, if not BETTER. On "Insomniac", Green Day gives us the bratty attitude, heavy power chords, catchy vocal melodies, energetic drumming and powerful basslines that make these 33 minutes a true punk classic.The music on this album is a bit heavier than "Dookie" and it's overall a bit more in-your-face, but with that comes a big slab of unforgettable songs that you can basically listen to all the way through and never get bored with. This album has spawned the popular songs such as "Geek Stink Breath" with its heavy chugging guitar riffs, the metal-influenced headbanger "Brain Stew" which feels like the entire song is one big breakdown...in a good way!, the very fast and very punk "Jaded", and the semi-sarcastic, semi "I don't care" attitude of "Stuck With Me".Those songs right there capture Green Day in their prime, but even beyond that we get even more. "Aramtage Shanks", the opener, reminds me quite a bit of "Burnout", the first song on "Dookie". "Brat" is one of my favorite old Green Day songs with a very catchy vocal melody throughout the chorus. "86" is another sing-a-long with a really cool overall vibe to it. "Panic Song" has a frantic opening bassline and a long, really well-written intro. The rest of the songs all fit in together really well and flow nicely, making it an overall conscice and smooth album."Insomniac" is definitely one of the best albums of punk in the last 20 years, and is far too underrated for its own good. With that being said, I hope all reader will go to the store, pick it up and crank it in your room, your car, wherever. "Insomniac" is Green Day at their best! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Considering this is Avenged Sevenfold's breakthrough album, there must be a good reason for it. In a decade where so-called metal bands compose four-minute songs of formulaic, downtuned and overly-melodic riffs, harsh yelling and repetitive breakdowns, Avenged Sevenfold brings something new to the table with "City of Evil".This album shows them progressing with their sound. "Sounding The Seventh Trumpet" was their fastest and rawest, but their least-professional sounding and you could tell they were younger when they wrote it. "Waking The Fallen" showed much better songwriting and a bigger, more epic sound, bringing guitar solos into the mix (including great ones such as in "Eternal Rest" or "Second Heartbeat").Now comes "City of Evil". What sound is presented here, you may ask? Well, "City of Evil" sounds pretty similar to "Waking The Fallen", however, on this album that is far less screaming, the tempos are slowed down a little, there are more intricate riffs, an even more epic sound and many more guitar solos. So the speed and screaming of some of the stuff on "Waking The Fallen" HAS vanished, but with "City of Evil", Avenged Sevenfold added some amazing, new elements to their sound. Here are the highlights of the album:"Beast and the Harlot": A modern classic that starts off slow, featuring a piano and a complex 9/8 time signature. The song picks up with a great guitar riff, then explodes with the same riff played one octave lower, so it gets much heavier. A melodic, sing-a-long chorus and an amazing guitar solo, one of the greatest around, are also featured, along with an intense bridge towards the end that goes back into the chorus. What a classic!"Burn It Down": A faster, even more intense song with heavier, rawer riffs and a blistering, dual-guitar melody in the beginning. Another melodic, sing-a-long chorus is featured here."Bat Country": Fast, punk-ish riffs, a blazing guitar solo, amazing guitar duals and a catchy chorus are featured here. The verses are also intense, and a soft section kicks in every now and again, making for some great tension and release. That makes the song even more interesting, AND even more professional. By the way, this song was also written about the Johnny Depp cult film "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". I highly recommend you watch that movie!"Trashed and Scattered": One of my favorite guitar intros on the album kicks this song off, before going into blazing speeds, blistering shred solos and a catchy, shout-a-long chorus. Just an overall incredible song!"Seize The Day": A beautiful, piano-driven ballad with some jaw-dropping guitar work, not to mention some heart-melting verses and choruses. One of the best, metal ballads of recent years."Strength of the World": The longest song on the album, this is a Middle-Eastern tinged headbanger with heavy riffs and an awesome, shout-a-long chorus.So while much of the screaming and metronome-pushing tempos of "Waking The Fallen" have vanished, the scales are evenly balanced with all that was gained with this album. It's a modern classic that can be listened to over and over again, I know I've done that. But for those that still haven't heard this, check it out NOW!!! Thanks for the time, and peace.

It's hard to think that this album came out in 1970, especially when you look at how influential it was. If you listen to this and then put on an Iron Maiden record, it's clear that the Maiden boys took a lot of infleunce from these guys. Wishbone Ash was probably the first band to both twin-guitar riffs, although Judas Priest was also a contemporary that did the same thing.Even with only six songs here, the album is generally flawless, and a brilliant combination of hard rock, blues-rock, folk and progressive. Amazing musicianship throughout, everything from the guitar, bass and drums is always exciting and interesting. The vocals are also top-notch here, with the Ash boys singing about such mystical things that were common amongst '70s metal/rock.Well, there's not much more to say here. This album is as musically satisfying as it groundbreaking and infleuntial. Highly recommended for fans and newcomers, this is the sort of album that should've catapaulted the band to superstardom. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Saw" is one of those movies that divides its viewers straight down the line in opinions. You either love it or hate it. Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because "Saw" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, "torture horror" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: "Saw" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, "Saw" is actually a lot more than just a "torture" horror film.If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of "Law and Order" or "NYPD Blue", just with harsher graphic content.This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.This "Saw" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.Overall, "Saw" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot. You may just end up loving it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

This is an album that people are going to either really like or really dislike, due to the extreme nature of it, and the fact that it's a raw, low-budget live recording on a two-track recorder in some Minnesota music club. However, I am in favor of this album greatly. Wanna know why? It's 17 songs in 29 minutes. It's frantic power chords and blazing guitar solos. It's nimble, light-speed basslines and breakneck drum work. It's three young men whose vocals are a rallying cry to the spirit of true punk music. It's the feeling of a real live show where everything is happening at once and you don't know what to expect next. Although not as classy, sophisticate, elaborate or complex as such musical giants as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, or the works of early Genesis, this is some of the greatest rock 'n' roll ever recorded in all its sweatsoaked, headbanging, fistpumping, anthemic glory. Get a taste of this! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Fraiser is without a doubt one of the definitive sitcoms of modern television. Its blend of intelligence, humour, drama, love and life all mix together to create one awesome show! It is hilarious and in a very intelligent way; all the episodes are ingenious and well-crafted and all the characters are very interesting and are each essential to the show. Frasier, as the lead character, leads a life of interesting, hilarity, drama, and at times adventuruous oddity. Niles is the equally hilarious and brilliant brother who is absolutely in love with Daphne. Martin's the hard-nosed, retired father figure who, deep down, cares about his sons. Daphne's the British caretaker who always has a great quip to add. Roz is about as desparate as they come in terms of her love life, but she brightens the atmosphere with some very funny moments. And, Bulldog adds his hardcore self-pompous attitude that can be quite a scream! Plus, there's always something hysterical their dog Eddie does in every episode that just makes me belt out his name in laughter, "Eddieeeeeee!". Hahaha, a little tradition of mine while I watch Frasier.In addition, the sound and picture quality of these DVDs is excellent, and it comes with some great extra features that offers even more bang for your buck. So don't miss out on the laughs, brilliance and depth that is Frasier! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Van Halen is the type of band that can satisfy somebody with high expectations. The interesting thing about them is that while they certainly have a sound of their own, it seems like experimenting is a high priority for them. Between the hair-metal of "1984", the half-moody, half-good time "Van Halen 2" and the unstoppable monster of their debut album, "Van Halen", (all of which had their share of popular tunes), it's easy to see how something less commercial or experimental would tend to go unnoticed.Unfortunately, that's the case with "Fair Warning". A brilliant album, yes, but the truth of thematter is that it wasn't remembered for high-on-the-chart singles such as "Jump" or "Panama". However, what it lacks for in commercial success it more than makes up for in clever songwriting and an overall dark tone. On a positive note, it's probably one of their overall greatest albums."Fair Warning" is the type of album where each song can flow pretty well into the following, even if the styles are a bit different. In addition, "Fair Warning" overall paints an easy-to-see picture. You can almost imagine a movie being made in the scenery that's painted by the rebelliousness of "Unchained" or the third-world neighborhood of "Mean Street". It's a land of murky tales and strange situations that's just so interesting and quite dark that you are brought in without hardly knowing. The imagery on the album covers, front and back, hint at what such a place might be like; twisted days where people go wild, uncertain events pop up out of nowhere, and all is portrayed by the soundtrack, a hard-rocking, moody masterpiece that is "Fair Warning".All right, so more to the point, the music on this album is quite unique and interesting. Even in all the murky emotions, the sing-a-long choruses and anthemic displays of power show you that while this album may prove to be a change of pace, Van Halen is basically the same. Eddie Van Halen displays more exciting stunts on his guitar, while David Lee Roth erupts like a volcano with his comments and amusingly entertaining performances. Michael Anthony's basswork is quite present on this album, too, and Alex Van Halen's "what kind of drums is that man playing on?" drumming is top-notch, too. Overall, this album is yet another display of Van Halen's both incredible talent and catchy songwriting."Mean Street": The first, thirty seconds are Eddie Van Halen's progressive dual-handed tapping, a technique so unusual that when my guitar teacher showed me a long, long time ago, I was drawn in and bought this album. The main riff is so awesome it makes you wanna turn the power all the way up. The closing solo is very impressive as well, and basically, everybody is at the top of their game here. An instant classic." 'Dirty Movies' ": Wow, in just four minutes, Van Halen plays one of the most unpredictable songs I've ever heard, in a GOOD way. There are a lot of changes in this song, and random things occuring, such as David Lee Roth's spoken word, "Hey, you remember when that girl was prooom queen? Oh, wow.", and "Take it off! Take it all off!!!", and the cheering, this is a great song full of surprises."Sinner's Swing!": A fast-paced rocker that contains a very explicit lyric, especially for a VH song, but this is an awesome three-minute hard-rock blast."Hear About It Later": OK, a little time-travel here. Remember VH's debut? A song on there, "Feel Your Love Tonight"? I CANNOT TELL YOU how much this track sounds like a murky, love-gone-bad version of that song. Even so, it's still original with an anthemic sing-a-long chorus and some interesting, opening guitar work."Unchained": Alongside "Mean Street", this is probably my favorite song on the album. It opens with a huge, loud, crunchy guitar riff, the fast, fade-in drums, and DLR's, "ALL RIGHT!", shout. Great soloing and another funny DLR performance inside.("One break, commmming uppp!".)"Push Comes To Shove": A very unusual VH song focused around a funky bassline and more basic drumwork. This song makes me thing about walking along the suburban streets of New York City, bundled up in the autumn, thinking about everything that's going on in your life. With such lyrics as, "Seems like forty days and forty nights since somebody's called me by my first name/ Including you", this is an introspective song that's an absolute delight, served up Van Halen style."So This Is Love?": The complete opposite of "Push Comes To Shove", this song has the swing and groove of an early Black Sabbath tune (one of Tony Iommi's guitar heroes was jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt). Along with an original VH sound and for some reason, a Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe, this is yet another great rocker."Sunday Afternoon In The Park": A slow, sludgy, two-minute instrumental with some of the wildest guitar playing I can recall hearing from Eddie. The riff starts and stops with some slow but cool drum fills of his brother Alex, and then, fading in is a hot, nasty guitar riff that leads into the closer..."One Foot Out The Door": The killer riff continues here with Alex Van Halen's trademark, fade-in drumming, and DLR and Michael Anthony both kick in. The song and album close with yet another blazing guitar solo, and thus ends it all.There you go, the dark, underrated masterpiece that is "Fair Warning". Although not the most commercially successful release, it's among Van Halen's very best. So if you want an album with massive talent but still packs the anthemic immortality that Van Halen displays so well, "Fair Warning" can almost undoubtedly get that taken care of. If you like this and want to explore more VH, I'd strongly recommend checking out, at least, "Van Halen (1)" and "1984", which both show these guys at the top of their game. Have a good time with this one, and until next time, peace!

"Let's Go" is a great album full of true punk energy, attitude and spirit. I personally prefer "...And Out Come The Wolves" because the songwriting is better and more of the songs stick out, but this is still a great album. "Let's Go" is less about the ska influence than it is about playing faster, power-chord punk rock. As I said, the songwriting on "...And Out Come The Wolves" is better, but for straight-up street-punk, you can't go wrong with this album! Get it, crank it, love it! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Rancid is one of the best bands of modern punk music. "...And Out Come The Wolves" is a great combination of old-school punk, ska-punk and pop-punk. In terms of famous ska-punk bands, I like these guys more than Sublime because Rancid has a punkier vibe. Either way, this album would be perfectly suited for hanging out on the boardwalk near the beach, or the soundtrack to walking down the streets of the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The songs go from having an edgy, guitar-heavy vibe to a laid-back, reggae-influenced vibe, and the switching to and from is perfectly done.With over 20 songs on the album clocking in at over 49 minutes, there's plenty to love. All the songs are great, but standout classics as ones such as "Maxwell Murder", "Time Bomb", "Ruby Soho", "She's Automatic", "Journey To The End of The East Bay", "Old Friend" and "Roots Radical". Be sure to check this album out if you want to get into the band, or if you don't have it yet. Any fans of ska-punk, pop-punk or straight-up punk-rock will be sure to dig this! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Dead and Breakfast" pulled a fast one on me personally. I was really looking forward to completely bashing this movie. There were so many things in the first half that made it unbearable, I was ready to give it two stars, or even one, which I've never done for a movie. But then of course, halfway through it becomes a lot more enjoyable and my horror senses perked up like Spiderman in Sing-Sing! So what did I think about this slasher-gone-possession/comedy? Read on to find out!To be honest, the back story is thin as paper. The movie opens up with the six main characters in their RV driving to a friend's wedding, I didn't know until she mentioned that a girl and her boyfriend were strangers to the others? Yeah, that makes sense. Then they decide to stop at an overnight hotel, when clearly they have enough sleeping space in the RV. Well, that's just the beginning of the movie's shenanigans and tomfoolery.The town in which they stop is absolutely riddled with yokel wonders. In fact, practically all of the characters in this movie are complete and absolute pinheads! The town residents are country bumpkins, evident in such lines as"You don't eat meat? Hhmm... how about beaver!". The sheriff also starts a massive shootout/mob-fight because somebody yanked a hair off the back of his head. Oh yeah, makes total sense, no problem. The main characters, most of the time are hotheaded booze-guzzlers. In retrospect, it's all actually pretty funny but at the beginning can be annoying. Then we have a guy who puts cigarettes in his mouth but doesn't light them? Terry Gilliam would be dying of laughter if he saw.There are also comic strip postcards in the entire opening credits, and a segway from scene to scene. It's a unique idea and I give them credit for doing something like that, but it just feels like filler to me. We also get a narrator that combines country and rap. Sometimes it's really entertaining, other times it's just obnoxious, like when he sings a song that sounds like a total ripoff of the Eagles 'Take It Easy', at the town hoedown.So, while I found the first 35 minutes of this film to be absolutely detestable, irritating and self-parodying, the rest of the movie ironically kicks it into high gear and becomes very enjoyable. One thing that did pull me through the first half-hour was that a few of the jokes were quite amusing, and there's great gore scenes throughout the entire film. This was evident towards the beginning, but really escalated as the movie went on. It also went from a slasher mystery to a possession-horror film halfway through? Well, I've seen weirder. One part that I absolutely fell in love with was when the country-rap narrator was singing a song and all the possessed zombie-like town residents started dancing like it was an '80s music video, whereas the song was some mix between country and the most stereotypical '90s rap. It's just beautiful.Bottom line: If you can survive the first 35 minutes or so of this movie, which are horrible, the rest of the movie should prove to be quite entertaining. Lots of super-gory scenes throughout the movie, some great jokes, and some really unique ideas put to the screen. If the writers were a little more consistent this movie would probably be a four or five-star film, but for what it is, I've seen worse movies. Check it out and have a gory fun time! Thanks for the time, and peace.

There's something about "Dawn of the Dead" that makes it so captivating. Sure, there are plenty of great zombie movies out there, but this classic is one not to be missed. In case you're unfamiliar with it, it's kind of like a non-sequential continuation of "Night of the Living Dead". Set in Philadelphia, this tells of four SWAT-team members that hide out in a mall from the living dead, while taking advantage of the mall and getting kicks outta it, too.That alone should let you know that this movie is awesome. Imagine what it would be like to shoot down the flesh-eating undead in a massive mall! This movie has everything from the zombie horror of blood-splattering and flesh-eating to thrilling action to slapstick comedy. The movie goes from scary to funny to sociopolitical all in its two-hour run."Dawn of the Dead" is, in case I didn't state it enough, an extraordinary movie. What other zombie flick offers shooting zombies down in an open field at the break of dawn, a blue-skinned Hare Krsna zombie and makeup artist legend Tom Savini in a leather-clad biker gang riding their motorcycles in the dead of night?Yep, this movie goes from the slaying of the undead to genuinely ironically funny moments, such as slapping a whipped cream pie in a zombie's face, or the scene where two of the guys take the money from a register and smile for the security camera (that one's a good laugh!).And just to prove that this zombie movie doesn't disappoint, there's plenty of the red stuff getting splattered from zombies and victims alike, alongside their consumption of flesh! And yeah, I'm sure you're aware of the social commentaries on the buyer's consumption at the mall. George A. Romero's good at the double-entendres in the plot like that, he's quite an intelligent film-maker."Dawn of the Dead" is definitely a special movie, and isn't necessarily one of those movies that you'd pop in every week or so. It's an experiece, and a stunning one at that, both visually and at times intellectually. So kudos to Mr. Romero, who knew what he was doing and never sold out, you made a great movie! All fans of zombie films MUST watch this classic! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for the time, and peace.

While I do think Rancid is great at making ska- and reggae-influenced punk songs, I think "Rancid 5" is just as good, even though it doesn't contain any of the ska influence present on their previous albums. This one is 39 minutes of guitar-driven street-punk, and it's 39 minutes of loud, hard and fast goodness. I'm not sure how many fans will favor the hardcore vibe of this album as opposed to earlier classics such as "Time Bomb" or "Ruby Soho", but to me, this album has everything punk should be. If you've ever been curious as to how Rancid would ever sound should they make a more hardcore-punk album, then I'm pretty sure you're gonna like this album a lot. Hopefully, it'll earn a spot in your music library soon, and will be cranked in your player as well! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Picking up right where "Basket Case" left off, "Basket Case 2" proves to be more of a crazy, fantasy-movie of a wild-ride than a horror sort of indulgence. Don't get me wrong, "Basket Case 2" is an absolutely brilliant and amazing movie, and probably the reason why half the synomyms for "crazy" were invented, i.e. "wacky", "loopy", "zany", etc. It's just THAT out there...but great at the same time!In this movie are more of the crazy, imaginative monsters such as Belial. Your eyebrows are gonna raise probably a dozen times in this movie, but if you can handle that, then this is going to be a newfound treasure trove of comedy-horror crossover goodness.I will admit, in comparison to the first movie, this one has a bit of a slower pace and can get a little dull in some areas, but when the excitement picks up again, it'll keep you entertained!Now despite the leaning towards the fantasy and comedy aspect, there's still a solid amount of blood and gore, giving the movie an "R" rating, and that shows that the movie still keeps a decent horror aspect for those interested. It just goes to show that this movie is strong from all angles. Definitely give it a watch, it's highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

In keeping with my "31 Reviews for 31 Days of Halloween" review marathon, here's a really obscure slasher-film from the late '80s. I found this in its entirety on Youtube so you don't have to go searching everywhere for the VHS of it. Overall, this was a pretty decent slasher film. The plot was minimal and the way they chose to end it will make you shake your head and put your face into your palm. However, there were a few good gore scenes, the setting was excellent and was a pretty powerful thing, underlining the feeling of isolation. It was also nice to watch the development of the relationship between Gerald and Lillian, among the other detailed social mini-plots throughout the movie. Finally, despite a rather half-brained ending, the twist thrown in at the end was exciting and pretty brilliant! Good for watching once or twice maybe. Thanks for the time and peace.

Every one of the great guitar gods of our rock and roll time became whom they are for a unique style or technique they used or created. Hendrix used feedback and much distortion through his intricate riffs and otherworldly soloing. Eric Clapton held long rock jams that incorporated piercing fretwork and blues inspiration. Yngwie Malmsteen invented the shred technique. Joe Satriani had riffs and licks to build up to stunning, instrumental performances. And the double-handed tapping? The hammer-ons and pull-offs?That's where Eddie Van Halen came in.Of course, that's not to say the rest of Van Halen isn't talented. In fact, Alex Van Halen is a fantastic drummer, Diamond Dave gave birth to a generation of hard-rock frontment with his falsetto screams and clownish, onstage persona, and Michael Anthony gave us a steady bass-guitar rhythm that, when the four of them combined, produced this stunning debut.Among guitar albums, this is certainly one of the finest. If you were a teenager back in '78, loved rock, and thought it was doomed due to the disco-era, you probably embraced this album, playing the LP until it was so worn out, you had to go back to the music store and buy a fresh one for a dollar or so. And if you were like I was, a teenager who never heard Van Halen until he bought this album what seemed like forever ago, you're in for a treat.Beginning with "Runnin' With The Devil", the opening bassline and catchy guitar riff draw you in, and won't stop until this mammoth of an album is through. Included in this song is some fine, heavy drumming and a roaring, guitar lick repeated once. "Eruption" revolutized the guitar and changed its history forever. Beginning with some opening rhythm section support (thanks to Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony), Eddie takes you through a 1:42 trip of insane, exciting guitar playing that, when audiences in 1978 must have heard him for the first time, got shocked beyond belief. Just listen to the opening bit of guitar playing...I DARE YOU not to listen to this song more than once. Coming in where the fadeaway of "Eruption" left us is a pile-driving cover of the classic Kinks song "You Really Got Me", with a heavy bassline and huge, crunchy guitar riff that would soon typify Van Halen's style. This one is a bit longer than the original and has a closing that's guaranteed to raise a few thousand hands when played lived."Ain't Talkin' Bout Love" continues Eddie's unique guitar playing. If you take guitar and your teacher likes VH, as mine does, he might explain about the "chirping" style of picking Eddie does here, as well as slight muting during the opening A-minor riff. If you're new to VH and you go to a present-day concert, you should definitely expect to hear this one. It'll get both casual fans and older, longtime VH followes to pump their fists in the air. "I'm The One" has a bit of a swing feel to it, similar to "Hot for Teacher" on the stunning VH album "1984". Yet, one major difference here is that this track has a very cool, doo-wop break towards the end before Eddie, Alex and Michael go crazy on their insturments. If you weren't expecting this, know about it now, for this is quite an addicting track."Jamie's Cryin'" seems to be fit for late '70s, early '80s radio, as it has a great, sing-a-long chorus and is only three and a half minutes, but is still a classic song. "Atomic Punk" is a personal favorite of mine, and what makes this song important is the thumping bassline and pounding drumbeat, with an unusual opener: this is one if the first rock songs I know that involves the scratching of a guitar string. Lots of other axemen have done this probably, but Eddie is surely one of the first."Feel Your Love Tonight" seems to almost perfectly prefigure '80s pop-metal: happy, guitar-based, sing-a-long songs. The lyrics seem cheesy in a way (which is never a bad thing) and it's easy to see, if you've given the previous tracks a good listen, that DLR can easily pull it off. "Little Dreamer" is a very beautiful and melodic song. There is no way you can listen to this song, hear Diamond Dave's soaring vocals and not feel at awe in the audio beauty."Ice Cream Man" is a jolly, almost blues-based song, another one with a swing feel. Opens up with DLR singing, and, to state a truth that might surprise some, plays acoustic guitar. The other three in the band wait until this catchy, little anthem explodes and becomes even better. "On Fire" seems to be a very appropriate closer. David Lee Roth seems to embody a true rock-star persona with the lyrics, and the instrumental work here is excellent, as well.Sure, this album is only a few minutes over a half-hour and contains just under a dozen songs, but...It's not everyday a revolutionary album comes out, especially a debut. And who would have thought that this band, to emerage out of Pasadena, CA would have this much success after just one album? One album, I might add, that achieved diamond status. The first time I heard this, and not even ALL of it, while coming home from the mall, I rushed downstairs and tried to experiment with my guitar just as Eddie did. Of course, I had only been playing for a short period of time by then...I was (and still am) certainly an eager guitarist.All right, not to fall underneath an avalanche of great memories, I'd just like to sum up my review by saying that if you haven't already heard this album, it's a must-have and one I guarantee you'll love to listen to over and over, as I did. There's just some magic about listening to these songs for the first time. Anyway, thanks for your time and goodnight.

"Shivers" is body-horror master David Cronenberg's big screen premiere film. This is where it all started, the legacy that bred "Scanners", "The Brood", "Videodrome" and other classics. How does "Shivers" make out for Cronenberg's big-screen debut? Read on!Taking place at a luxurious apartment complex called Starliner Towers, "Shivers" is about a breed of biological disease mutants that transmit themselves sexually from person to person. This was made in the mid '70s... yep this spells out catastrophe! Lots of deranged terror, gore everywhere and sexual indulgence. This is exploitation horror at its finest, and also has an intelligent script to boot along with its nuts-out display of violence and debauchery. David Cronenberg is one of those guys that doesn't sacrifice intelligence for a movie that has a lot of visual potency.This DVD also comes packed with extras including the trailer and a 20-minute interview with Cronenberg explaining the history behind the production of "Shivers". Hard to believe it was made in only two and a half weeks! Overall, this is a great buy for all horror fans, and balances shock and fun in a great mixture. Highly recommended. Thanks for the time and peace.

In and throughout the 1970s, EVERYBODY was making it big: Led Zeppelin started to sell millions of records, Pink Floyd defined a generation with "Dark Side of the Moon" and Queen was establishing themselves as one of the most diverse 70s band, etc. To make something truly memorable was a pretty great feat...and that's what Black Sabbath did. After the earth-shattering debut album came this: No, they didn't fall into a sophomore slump, no they didn't become "sell-outs" and no, they didn't become forgotten: This was the establishment for heavy metal that would inspire countless hopefuls. As you've heard before, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and some other, forgotten greats (Iron Butterfly, Vanilla Fudge, Blue Cheer) played what would become metal, but true to the word, Sabbath is considered the first actual heavy metal band.To describe this album without the actual music is a difficult task, but I'll try best I can to convince you what a landmark gem this is."War Pigs" is an eight-minute anti-war song. The first minute starts off jazzy, with some of Iommi's power chords in between Geezer's cool basslines. And the lyrics...unforgettable, to say the least. Some of the most Sabbath-esque lyrics and one of their greatest songs ever. Great jams and great closing.- "Politicians hide themselves awayThey only started the warWhy should they go out to fight?They leave that role to the poor""Paranoid" is almost a living definition of that recipe for an infamous heavy song. The bluesy, opening riffs, the power chords, tempo and lyrics, and all in 2:47.- "All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfyThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify"At four and a half minutes, "Planet Caravan" demonstrates a landscape of rainy, midnight music and a gentle touch to this terrific album.- "We sail through endless skiesStars shine like eyesThe black night sighsThe moon in silver trees""Iron Man" is one of the most well-known Sabbath songs of all time with one of the greatest riffs of all time...and opening with that unforgettable robot voice: "I am Iron Man". Plus, there's this sped-up, top-notch jam right in the middle of this masterpiece! And with that, we finish Side A.- "Has he lost his mind?Can he see or is he blind?Can he walk at allOr if he moves, will he fall?""Electric Funeral" has an unforgettable, wa-wa guitar riff, sludgy (in a good way) rhythm, and of course, a delivery of lyrics sung in Ozzy's keening voice. Another great track you must listen to!"Hand of Doom" is one of the longest songs on the album, at more than seven minutes. This is half low-volume, mostly jazz bass and drum instrumental during the verses with classic Sabbath jams featuring of course, Tony Iommi's guitar work. All in all, this is a fabulous work of heavy music that deserves to be listen to."Rat Salad" is a two-and-a-half minute instrumental, featuring something memorable from Tony, Geezer and Bill. While Ozzy doesn't play the harmonica on this (as he does on a couple Sabbath tracks) it shows that these guys are true instrumentalists.The closing track, a six-minute plus leviathan of a Sabbath song, "Fairies Wear Boots" starts off, in the first twelve seconds, somewhat like a Van Halen song intro. (Listen to the higher, chugging riffs and gradual come-in of the drums and you'll see what I mean.). The opening jam lasts about a minute and a half, and though there's limited lyrics, the song, in its entirety, will make you want to listen till the bottom side of your CD is almost totally scratched-up.There I go...I've described "Paranoid", the greatest, and one of the first, heavy metal albums of all time. It wasn't easy, but if you don't already have this and want not only a 70s classic, but one of the original building blocks of all hard rock/heavy metal, you WILL want this...and I strongly recommend buying it!

Having all three August Burns Red albums, I can say that I like this one better than their first album, "Thrill Seeker". Don't get me wrong, I thought that was a good album, but this one just kicks things into a higher gear, and the band members seem to challenge themselves even more. That's something that I, as a fellow, young musician, like to see: When musicians challenge themselves and attempt to write better, more interesting, and crazier songs. This shows that August Burns Red is growing with each release, and with that being said, "Messengers" is highly recommended.If you're new to August Burns Red, let me go into a little description of their sound: They play loud, hard, and fast. They can probably get a whole arena of people banging their heads. And they have some of the most meaningful, Christian-inspired lyrics around today. How can it get any better? Simple. The five of them are insane at their parts at vocals, two guitars, bass and drums. While I honestly admit that each of the songs do sound a little bit alike, the positive part of this is that the band challenges themselves to be the best musicians they can on each song. They show no signs of giving less than their best with each riff, breakdown or solo. And oh yeah, they can make your speakers burst with insanity!So to wrap it up, "Messengers" is a highly recommended album full of amazing music and thought-provoking, Christian-inspired lyrics. These guys sure know what they're doing, even with this being only their 2nd album. Although, their third album, "Constellations" is also very highly recommended, because I feel it's just as good, if not better, than this one! Thanks for the time, and peace.

At the point in time of Cannibal's career that "Bloodthirst" was released, they have refined their technique to the 35 minutes of brutality experienced on this album. Each album released by every band, regardless of the genre, is a snapshot in time as to where they are. So where are the Cannibal boys at the time this album was released?This album has a lot of good things going on for it. For one thing, Paul Mazurkiewicz's drumming has not only been defined, but refined to a brutal art. His blast beats and drum fills are insane, but he's also good at keeping a tight, synchronized beat during slower parts of the album. Alex Webster shows any doubters that bassists are in fact, crucial to maintaining a heavy sound. Jack Owen and Pat O'Brien are able to spit out a flood of impressive guitar work: everything ranging from frantic tremolo picking to lower-than-the-bowels-of-the-Earth Bb string palm-muted chugging, fast-as-light sweep-picking, mid-range shredding, and some of the creepiest guitar harmonizations around. Awesome stuff! And George proves to you, over and over, that he is amazing at mixing catchy vocal lines with inhuman brutality, not to mention being both very fast and accurately pronouncing the lyrics.This album is indeed heavier than the material released during the Chris Barnes era, but that doesn't mean the band has given up songwriting technique for the sake of heaviness. Combined with their aforementioned talents, the band writes such memorable songs as the light-speed headbanger-worthy opener, "Pounded Into Dust", the haunting, sludgy, pounding "Unleash The Bloodthirsty", and the guitar-shredding fiesta "The Spine Splitter". They also take the speed and intensity of their art to such dizzying heights as in "Hacksaw Decapitation", where, after a creepy, atmospheric minute-long drone experimentation, the band goes into a devastating performance of double-bass madness, complex, technical riffs abound, and vocals that could open up a crack in the Earth.Overall, considering how much modern extreme music is a very mixed bag, some keepers, some forgettable, "Bloodthirst" proves it's a worthy addition to any metalhead's collection. It's able to keep fantastic musicianship along with intelligent and mature songwriting without sacrificing it for the sake of just being heavy and brutal. I highly recommend this album! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Flowers of Flesh and Blood" is one of the most notorious splatter films of underground horror. The idea is simple: A Japanese dude kidnaps a Japanese chick, sedates her in this room that almost makes a "Saw" set-up look like Shangri-La, and the following is done to the lady, all while dressed up like a samurai:1) Wrist-slitting.2) Arm mutilation.3) Leg mutilation.4) Decapitation.5) Disembowelment.6) Licking said decapitated head.7) Eyeball plucking.8) Eyeball sucking.9) The Psycho Samurai (I like your name for him, Captain Insanity!) then sings a song that includes the words "pool of blood" "sea of fire", and throughout the movie spits dialogue that is ten times cheesier than even the cheesiest Japanese comic book. (Even though I used to love reading the "Rave Master" manga all the time a while ago.)Now before you go and say "Wait a minute, Bill! You're giving away the whole movie!", I'll say this: "Guinea Pig 2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood" is NOT one of those movies where you hear about the gore and just neglect the movie. It's a VISUAL EXPERIENCE. A visual experience where you should NOT EAT WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE! HAHA.Obviously, this is NOT A SNUFF FILM, even though there's a good chance you might be able to fool somebody into thinking it is. But then again... I don't know everybody that way. So, while Flowers of Flesh and Blood:1) Has no plot.2) Barely has any dialogue.3) Only revolves around two characters.and 4) Is only 42 minutes long...I GOTTA give this five stars just for the director having the simple but awesome idea of just making a short film about bloodsoaked, gore-splattering, mutilating insanity!IMPORTANT NOTE:You may hate this film. You may think it's a pointless "gore for sheer gore" sort of movie. You may think that it's not scary even though it's a horror movie. But this movie accomplishes what it sets out to do.SHOCK. DISGUST. REVOLT. OUTRAGE. NAUSEATE. And sure as heck break a lotta ground.FUN FACT:The fact that this movie was made in 1985 and is still gorier than most movies today scares me more than the movie itself!BOTTOM LINE:DON'T expect someting brilliant like SUSPIRIA. DON'T expect something psychological like THE SHINING. This is a short film done just to be GORY AND NASTY! And it gets five stars from me! Have fun with this, and make sure you've eaten BEFORE you watch this! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Planet Terror" is one of the most unique films I've seen in quite a while. It's a sort of parody/ tribute to the drive-in/ exploitation movies of the 1970s. Now here's my Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Watch "Planet Terror":1) It's brought to us by Robert Rodriguez, the same man that gave us "From Dusk Till Dawn", so you know this is gonna be something interesting, and especially well-made.2) ...and, like "From Dusk Till Dawn", this movie starts off serious but is able to do a 180 about 40 minutes into it. This basically means that the pacing of this movie is good and time really flies, even though it's about an hour and forty minutes long.3) There's plenty of odd characters, and while there isn't any real plot, all the characters contribute to the charm and appeal of this movie.4) A reason you MUST watch this movie, a girl has a machine gun for a leg! She doesn't get it until the last, twenty minutes or so, but when she DOES get become our loveable Machine Gun Sally...WATCH OUT!!! This includes when she shoots the ground and flies thirty feet over a wall like a comic book superhero. That's a clip you will DEFINITELY wanna watch again.5) Gore, gore, gore!!! This movie is packed with plenty of horror-related action, alongside LOTS of headshots and the red stuff flies like ducks flying south for the winter.6) Tom Savini makes an appearance as a police officer, and it's always cool to see Tom land a spot in a cool movie.7) The whole film even feels like a sort of '70s movie, if you forget the fact that it's a tribute to these types of movies, so we get the nostalgic feel and classic sorta setting.8) All the actors do a very good job at playing their roles, so this breathes even more life into the film.9) There are so many, ridiculous moments, like the guy that jumps around like a martial artist and rips zombies apart one after another after another!!! This movie is chock full of awesome moments and true novelty ideas that put a real twist on this type of movie.and Reason Number 10:10) This movie is a real treat because it doesn't follow the rulebook on what a horror/action/exploitation movie should be. Like "From Dusk Till Dawn" it is such a novelty item and SO COOL, it's a movie you just can't watch once. It's a fun-filled, action-packed, zombie-raging movie that YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY! Just kick back, grab a bottle of your favorite iced tea, and let the DVD play.Well, if you made it this far into the review, I wanna say thanks!!! If you're looking for a fun, exciting, gory, and actually rather funny movie, "Planet Terror" is a newfound gem that's sure to withstand the test of time, and can almost be called this generation's "From Dusk Till Dawn". Robert Rodriguez sure is making a name for himself as a writer and director, because both these movies are flat-out awesomeness!If you're looking for a horror/action-comedy movie that'll bring you a good time, "Planet Terror" will be your Knight in Bloody Armor...WITH the machine gun leg! LOL. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I got this album over five years ago, at the same time I got "All Hallow's EP". Between then and now, I've listened to this album countless times. "Black Sails in the Sunset" is truly one of the best real punk albums out of the last ten years. When people unfamiliar with the style of punk think of it, they think of three-chord, two-minute songs with deadpan, repetitive lyrics. However, AFI is so far above and beyond that, while still retaining a sound that keeps the punk-rock style alive and thriving. Read on to find out.Although I do get a kick out of their earlier albums, "Answer That and Stay Fashionable", and "Very Proud of Ya", I think "Black Sails in the Sunset" really expanded their sound and made them stand out. On this album, we have the songwriting dynamics not usually featured in punk, wide and ranging vocals, frantic guitar work, intense basslines and some of the most insane and energetic drumming around. And to top it all, lyrics that are all at once dark, beautiful and mysterious.From the growing buildup of "Strength Through Wounding", we are brought into the album's mesmerizing atmosphere. "Porphyria Cutanea Tarda" retains that atmosphere and still kicks things into gear, a gear that's about 100 miles an hour, for that matter! A song about vampires and vampirism, "Exsanguation" starts off with a great bassline and a slower introduction before picking up insane speed and energy, before going back into another slower, melodic section. Crazy to think all of this happens in under 3 minutes. "Malleus Maleficarum" is four minute of pure goth-punk brilliance, combining hypnotic vocal and musical melodies, shout-a-long lyrics and more of Adam Caron's awesome drum fills.Although "Narrative of Soul Against Soul" may seem dark, it's lyrics are actually positive and tells the listener to never give up, no matter how hard things may seem. This song is another to feature a combination of high speeds with a slower, more melodic section. "Clove Smoke Catharsis" makes for a nice change of pace, being a slow, almost surreal ballad, combining warm guitar lines with mysterious lyrics. "The Prayer Position" starts off with a sinister, snakelike guitar riff before going into a heavy, mid-paced verse. This song features an anthemic, shout-a-long chorus that's actually quite uplifting and empowering. "No Poetic Device" starts off with some artifical harmonics on guitar before going into a fast, dark headbanger. The interesting thing about this song is that it ends with a section that flows perfectly from the previous one, but at the same time almost sounds like a different song."Weathered Tome" starts off with an almost metal guitar riff, before going into a verse that has breakneck speed, and slowing things down in the chorus. Great songwriting here. "The Last Kiss" is one of the absolute fastest songs on the album, almost like a thrash-metal song written in punk-rock styling. This is a great one and a burst of musical and vocal energy. "At A Glance" is another very interesting song, with the first minute being fast and energetic before slowing things down to a somber, mysterious sort of mood. The vocal chants, which are featured throughout the album, are at their best here; they really highlight the atmosphere towards the end of the song.Finally, we get "God Called In Sick Today", a slow and depressing, but at the same time beautiful ballad. As mournful as this song is, it's quite addicting, and you may find yourself listening to it more than once in a row. After the ending guitar drone, we are met with seven minutes of silence before kicking off into the bonus track "Midnight Sun". This is a GREAT song, indeed! An uplifting and melodic chorus that blends in well with the energetic, mid-paced verses. The melodies and lyrics on this song are just done right, no doubts at all.Overall, I'd have to say my personal AFI album is "The Art of Drowning", which was less dark and more dreamlike, but "Black Sails in the Sunset" is an undisputed essential for AFI fans, and highly recommended for punk-rock fans. Because I've loved this album for so long, I admit that I am a bit biased against AFI's new sound, because I felt like the sound on this album, "The Art of Drowning" and "All Hallow's EP" was brilliant and ideal for the band. Be that as it may, this album is still one for the books! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Long before I got into Styx, I read in my Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll that in a 1979 poll, they were voted the most popular band for people aged 13-18. Of course, Styx can appeal to everybody, as the collection of songs on this album signals. I can't believe so many critics said negative things about these guys, they give the role of somebody who judges a bad name! Well, I don't care if those critics are too blind or unwilling to love Styx, because I do, as there are so many things to love about this compilation.For starters, it goes on sale for only ten bucks. Secondly, it's got sixteen songs wrapped up on one disc. Finally, it's got great liner notes and pictures of the band, along with songwriting credits.In terms of the music, it's got plenty to love, too. What opens the album is the rerecorded verison of "Lady". From the beautiful piano work, wall-of-vocals effect that became Styx's trademark, the epic drumming and fiery guitar solo, it's wonderful. "The Best of Times" starts off dramatically, but proceeds into a great song and followup to "Lady". "Loreli" has a strong guitar usage and seems to be a song featured in a movie based on the concept of the song, having a young lady move in with you. How awesome!The bouncy keyboards and great chorus in "Too Much Time On My Hands" goes to show that these guys just don't let up when it comes to great songwriting. All right, I've really gotta give it up for "Renegade". This was the first Styx song I've ever heard and it got me hooked! From the opening, melodic vocal usage, the heavy, funky guitar riff, pounding, arena-ready drums and blazing guitar solo, this is a song to love! "Come Sail Away" is an epic, six-minute song that is very uplifting, from more great piano and guitar work to the wall-of-vocal chant of "Come sail away! Come sail away!". Such a great and timeless song.Then comes the Christian-rock influenced ballad of "Show Me The Way". "Crystal Ball" seems to be another, early power ballad, and then, of course, there's the timeless, "Mr. Roboto". The dazzling, spacey keyboards, the chanting of "Secret! Secret! I've got a secret!", to the "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto", I mean, who could forget? And if you weren't around then, this'll still prove to be a timeless song.The rest of the songs are great, as well, and each musician is extremely talented and a great singer. This is very highly recommended as I hope that you'll love it all just as much as I do. Oh, by the way, I'm hoping to go to a Styx concert this summer, alongside another fave of my, Def Leppard! What a combination! Anyway, thanks for the time, and peace.

It's rather amusing to think that Cream formed over 40 years ago. They were so revolutionary, just about everything they did left a huge influence on rock bands to come. Ginger Baker is an insane drummer, and was one of, if not the very first, to use a double bass drum the way he did. Jack Bruce invented and perfected that fade-in bass technique and Eric Clapton...well, when you hear the man rip it out on this album, you know these guys were something special.Cream was one of the first power trios around. Right after them emerged bands like Blue Cheer, Rush and The Jimi Hendrix Experience, but seriously, how many guys were playing like the boys of Cream were in '66? Now, honestly speaking, I was fairly skeptical when purchasing this, at first at least, due to the fact that I saw Clapton listed as the second greatest rock guitarist of all time. Anybody who ranks high on a list has got to be there for a reason, and he proved it to me. I literally started laughing when I heard the blazing solos on songs like "Sweet Wine" and "NSU". The last time I heard a guy that great was somebody like Eddie Van Halen or the legendary Jimi Hendrix, (I got into Hendrix before I became a guitarist, and VH just as I started.)Clapton, Bruce and Baker form a magnificent band and the songwriting is just as strong as the musicianship. From the epic lyrics in "Tales of Brace Ulysses" to the timeless riff on "Sunshine Of Your Love", these guys could do it all. They went from psychedelic rock, blues rock, proto-metal, jazz fusion, jam rock, and a fusion of all of those elements to make a signature sound that made them the prototypical blues-rock trio that they were.Pros:- You get 20, great songs on this album.- I've seen it on sale for as low as ten bucks.- The liner notes are great, and you gotta love the psychedelic colors in the inner and outer covers!Cons:- Not too many negativities here, except for the recording technique that was used on the tracks from their debut, "Fresh Cream". All of the instruments are to the right and the vocals are to the left, for the most part. I would've thought that the record company would've fixed that! Oh well, it's just for a few tracks that the production is messed up.Overall:If you're just getting into Cream, this will make for a great album. Don't have any doubts when buying this, because you get plenty of songs at a great price. It's too bad these guys only lasted for a short time, but they really made magic in the period that they did. Cheers, and peace!

"Danzig 3: How The Gods Kill" is the next step after "Danzig 2: Lucifuge", and even a bigger step from "Danzig 1". The first Danzig album was straightforward classic hard rock/ early heavy metal-sounding. "Danzig 2" was definitely more diverse, although it delved into Danzig's blues-metal sound. "How The Gods Kill" goes further into that territory, although it adds more of a doom-metal sound, similar to early Black Sabbath although with the volume and power cranked way up!"Godless" is the open, seven-minute doom-metal masterpiece. It combines fast sections with slower, sludgier, heavier sections. Glenn's dark lyrics and passionate vocals wail throughout the song, and some blazing guitar soloing is featured, as well."Bodies": A faster song in B-minor which makes for some great guitar melodies. I also love the way Glenn Danzig sings "Bod-i-i-e-e-es!"."How The Gods Kill": A beautiful slow song that goes between clean guitar lines and powerful, heavy guitar riffs, with some of Glenn's most powerful vocal soloing throughout. Definitely one of Danzig's best songs ever."Dirty Black Summer": Not as dark as "How The Gods Kill", but definitely as good. This song is a bit faster with a heavy drumbeat, experimental, psychedelic guitar riffs combined with heavier guitar riffs a little bit similar to "Twist of Cain". This one is a very anthemic and powerful song!"Sistinas": A laid-back, almost balladic psychedelic-rock song with a very surreal, sunset-y feel to it. A definitely classic!The other songs are all quite good too, aside "Heart of the Devil", which is a little too slow and repetitive. However, "Danzig 3: How The Gods Kill" is yet another step forward, adding doom-metal, psychedelic and even bluesier touches to Danzig's sound. This is definitely a great album and a Danzig essential. Before going, I want to wish Glenn Danzig a happy 53rd birthday! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Picking up exactly where the original left off "Halloween 2" is able to deliver just as much horror movie entertainment as the original "Halloween". Everything about this movie makes it a classic; reinforcing the character development of the first movie while developing the new characters shown here, the plot, the series of events, and the acting, which I forgot to mention in my review of the original "Halloween". Probably most memorable are the talents of both Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis, who is probably the best horror-movie hero I've seen and shows Donald's acting skills, and Jamie Lee Curtis as her role of Laurie, who returns as the scream queen.Comparatively, this movie is more graphic than the original "Halloween", which virtually didn't show a drop of blood, and DEFINITELY didn't show a dude in a creepy Halloween mask getting smashed between two trucks before a fiery explosion occurred. (Which is one of my favorite moments in the movie!) So yes, "Halloween 2" is a bit more graphic than the original "Halloween", and is just as scary and suspenseful.What I did notice about this movie is the chilling, dream-like atmosphere. I know most slashers have a somewhat earthy element, but there's something about the dark, deserted hallways of the hospital late at night on Halloween that sets an intense and dream-like atmosphere, which seriously fascinated me with the movie, especially considering I didn't pick up on that the last time I saw it. So this movie is able to be scary, graphic and atmospheric all at the same time.Overall, while stylistically it's somewhat different from the original "Halloween", "Halloween 2" is just as good a movie, if not better. For fans of slasher films or horror films in general, especially those who want a movie with a chilling, dream-like atmosphere, "Halloween 2" will be a scream! Pick it up in time for Halloween night, too, so you can enter the dark realm of terror known as the scariest night of the year. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Metallica's sophomore album, "Ride The Lightning" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering "Kill 'Em All" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, "Master of Puppets" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and "...And Justice For All" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for "One".Regardless of whether or not "Ride The Lightning" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think "The Four Horsemen" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of "Ride The Lightning", simply read on."Fight Fire With Fire" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, "Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!". Great way to start off the album."Ride The Lightning", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment."For Whom The Bell Tolls" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out."Fade To Black" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out."Trapped Under Ice" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album."Escape" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song."Creeping Death" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos."The Call of Ktulu" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer "Orion" off "Master of Puppets", but this song is definitely a great one, too.So as you can see, "Ride The Lightning" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even "The Black Album" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.

If you asked somebody to think of ten heavy metal albums, regardless of the order or genre, there's a good chance one of them will be "Master of Puppets". Two decades ago, Metallica released this mammoth album, and it has definitely been a huge influence. Imagine all the bands that Metallica has influenced. To thrash metal, they did what The Ramones did to punk rock, or what Rush did to prog rock/metal, and this release shows it.Their debut album had a very NWOBHM sound to it, adding some bluesy bar and punk influences, to sound almost like an American Motorhead. By the release of the second album, they had added more complex and progressive touches. And by this release, they had perfected their style of music.Some people will say this is one of the best albums of all time. Others will say it's lacking in professional or proper songwriting, musicianship, etc. Still, even others will have mixed feelings about it. Listen to the album and judge for yourself. All the same, considering the monster riffs, lightning solos, battering drumming and overall use of the lyrics, given a grand, epic feel to the overall tone, and we have something that, to say the very least, you can't ignore."Battery" starts off with some dark, acoustic guitars, then has a quick power-metal styled riff before going into a simple but rapid guitar riff. A raging guitar solo comes in at the middle by none other than Kirk Hammett, and the climactic ending sets the perfect tone for a follow-up."Master of Puppets" has that epic, larger-than-life feel to it I was talking about. Legendary guitar riffing, a gentle, beautiful solo, and one of the coolest and most famous guitar solos following. Add an anti-drug meaning to it and the chanting of "Master! Master!", and you have one of the very best metal song of all time."The Thing That Should Not Be": A progressive, six-and-a-half minute song about a sea monster in Europe. Acoustic guitars open the song, but the crushing riff that repeats throughout shows a mix of thrash, stoner metal, even proto-grunge to some extent. A slow and powerful song with an almost mythological tone to it."Sanitarium": An epic, ballad-turned-thrasher in the stylings of "One" and "Fade To Black", this one is just another Metallica classic. The mystical atmosphere of the balladic part adds a cool touch, and then turns to an epic headbanger towards the end."Disposable Heroes": This eight-minute, antiwar monster track combines sinister speeds, galloping guitar riffs and pounding drums into yet another great song, with a great chorus to add."Leper Messiah": Another great song that's overall a bit slower, and has a powerful guitar riff."Orion": The greatest heavy-metal instrumental ever written, no questions asked, this one is second to none. An epic intro, great, chugging, guitar riffs, beautiful soloing that combines shred and a Jimmy Page style, a timeless bassline, and an awesome ending. If there were ever an eight-and-a-half, instrumental, thrash verison of "Stairway To Heaven", this would pretty much qualify."Damage Inc.": Has the best introduction of all the songs. The slow, melodic basswork gives yet another epic feel to the album, and then after about 75 seconds, the song explodes into a furious guitar riff and cannon drumming. Anthemic lyrics round out this underrated, speed-metal classic, and Kirk Hammett adds an amazing, forty-second plus guitar solo, one of my favorite of his, and certainly one of his best. The album ends on a speedy note, repeating the guitar riff used after the introduction.There you have it, all eight songs of "Master of Puppets". Unfortunately, this would also be the last album with Cliff Lee Burton, may he rest in peace. So with all said, if you're into metal, you'll certainly consider this to be a gem among gems. Play it loud, feel its power and epic force. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Every once in a while, an album would emerge that would prove as influential as it was awesome. Metallica's debut, "Kill 'Em All" happens to be one of them. Considering that it was released in 1983, it's amazing to think how many bands afterwards were driven to record metal in the vein of these guys. Whether or not this is the perfect thrash-metal album, it's an album that should belong in any metal collection."Kill 'Em All" is loud, fast, energetic, youthful and anthemic. It basically covers what a lot of bands want to achieve when they're younger. Additionally, most of the songs here aren't as blatantly political as later works such as "...And Justice For All". Plus, since this is early on in their career, some of the lyrics aren't as sophisticated as they are on other songs. (On Whiplash: "There's a feeling deep inside that drives you (bleep) mad", though that's the only song with cursing on it). In the end, however, this proves to be an excellent album."Hit The Lights": A fast-paced, feel-good anthem that includes a jaw-dropping guitar solo that lasts well over a minute long."The Four Horsemen": A seven-minute epic with plenty of great riffs, two stunning guitar solos and lyrics that tell of what can be either the band members themselves or the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Either way, it works."Motorbreath": A speedy, three-minute anthem that features an Iron Maiden-esque galloping riff, and lyrics that encourage you to live your life everyday. i. e. "Don't stop for nothin'/ It's full speed or nothin'"."Jump In The Fire": A song from none other than the Devil's point of view, speaking of how people are always doing wrong. This song has one of the catchiest riffs on the album, featuring an awesome blues groove and a great shred solo towards the end that lasts for a long part of the song."Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)": A tremendous bass solo by Cliff Burton that features his unique skills on the instrument. Definitely a landmark for musicians, considering the bass is sometimes forgotten about in some styles of music."Phantom Lord": Another great song that is the first on the album to feature clean guitars. This would be used in later Metallica songs such as "Battery" and "Fight Fire With Fire"."No Remorse": A classic song that seems to be about the wrongfulness of countries going off to war."Seek and Destroy": Another, classic song song with plenty of air guitar riffs, a shout-a-long hook/chorus and a great segment where the entire song speeds up for a while."Metal Militia": One of the fastest song on the album and a great way to end it.So while it may not be considered the greatest thrash album of all time, it's definitely a classic. If you want fast-paced, larger-than-life metal with as much talent as there is energy, "Kill 'Em All" is an awesome choice. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Despite being down one band member, which is always a loss, Exhumed nevertheless pick right up where they left off with "Gore Metal" on their second album, this one, "Slaughtercult". The same intense, menacing music is featured on here to please fans of extreme metal. Their signature, super-distorted bass comes in sharp and crystal clear, filling out the sound amazingly. The drums are also not of this world, as blast after blast, fill after fill, Col Jones proves that he's one of the definitive extreme-metal drummers, a title that's NOT easy to claim! The guitar work is also impressive, with grinding, crushing riff after riff and frantic, screaming, wild guitar solos, much like Slayer in a more darkly melodic key. There are indeed some darkly melodic bits and pieces here and there, such as the chorus riff of "Forged in Fire (Formed In Flame)" or the intro to "This Axe Was Made To Grind". The band also slows it down for a very catchy, headbangable, mosh-worthy groove on the last song "Vacant Grave".Overall, an excellent goregrind/deathgrind/ death metal album, whatever you may call it. Fans of heavy-duty metal are sure to dig this one, because even with their tongue firmly in cheek (you can tell they must have been snickering a little bit when they wrote the lyrics, they're great lyrics, but there are some enjoyable puns thrown in nevertheless), Exhumed is able to push new boundaries and make interesting ultra-extreme music. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"NOLA" is an album of incredible consistency, where every song is a great one and the entire album flows perfectly. The album combines Southern rock with sludge metal and some melodic traces that flow nicely throughout to create an amazing song. Phil Anselmo is at the top of his game, belting out his signature vocals with passion and power. The lyrics accompany the feel of the music, as well. But what blows me out of the water is the GUITAR TONE! Holy smokes alive, the tone of the guitar is absolutely perfect. Crushing but not harsh, chugging but in an old-school way, and the perfect mix of high-end and low-end. As a musician myself, this album probably has my favorite guitar tone of many albums in the metal genre. It sounds great when they band rips into its amazing guitar solos too, which are plentiful here.Standout tracks are the opening, grooving "Temptation's Wings", with a passionate, southern-styled solo. Then comes the equally as catchy, bludgeoning riff-rocker of "Lifer". "Pillars of Eternity" opens with some great drumming and goes once again into great riffs and solos. But what is probably my favorite track on the album is "Eyes of the South". In standard B-tuning, down two-and-a-half whole steps, the band plays a song that's equally as crushing as it is beautiful. The opening guitar solo is outstanding, going into a gigantic riff, with more melodic solos and a beautiful, clean section in the middle. Absolutely beautiful. Then back to the huge, crushing riffs to end this 5-minute masterpiece.The band also shows more of its softer side with the straight-up Southern rock of "Stone The Crow". A heartbreakingly beautiful performance is given here, with melodic, complex riffs, passionate vocals and somber lyrics that make this moodier, sullen song just as great as others. However, the band picks it up to their energetic, monstrous sound with the seven-minute epic closer of "Bury Me In Smoke", with more B-tuned guitars that will get you up on your feet and banging your head.Overall, this is one of the best metal albums of the '90s, a true classic in the styles of bands such as Black Sabbath and Lynyrd Skynyrd, but more modernized. You really can't go wrong with this album if you're looking for a heavy album full of awesome riffs, melodic passages and solos, and a thick, southern twang. This album surely delivers the anthemic "cruising down the highway" sort of loud vibe one could hope for, especially for a summer blast through the stereo! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Pantera's "Cowboys From Hell" is one of the greatest and most influential albums in the history of metal. When you look back at all the bands influenced by this album between 1990 and now, it's pretty amazing. But, influence aside, this album is just generally awesome.We got Phil Anselmo on lead vocals, who can go from a deep, distorted growl to a high-pitched wailer of a note! Vinnie Paul is definitely an impressive drummer who adds some great fills and rhythms to the songs. Rex Brown mostly stay low-key but his basswork runs smoothly through the album.Then there's the guitarist: Dimebag Darrell. A legend of our modern time, taken away from us far too young. But as for this album, he really shines here, ripping out some blazing riffs, melodies and solos throughout the entire album. Here's what I think about some of my favorite songs on an album that shattered metal!"Cowboys From Hell" has a great build-up of an opener, and kicks out some great, heavy riffs, full of infectious grooves, and a great guitar solo, along with the shout-a-long chorus to boot."Primal Concrete Sledge" is the thrashiest song on the album, and only lasts 2:13. With the fast-paced, low, chugging guitar riffs, pounding drums and a Middle Eastern-tinged guitar solo, this is a great one. Plus, it features some of Phil's fastest singing around."Psycho Holiday" is the complete opposite of "Primal Concrete Sledge", adding an incredible amount of funk and grooves, it almost sounds like Metallica combined with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bouncing, heavy riffs, polyrhythmic drumming and a guitar solo that lasts for a headbanging minute, this is sure to please all metalheads."Heresy" is another song in the thrashier vein, with more wild and high-pitched vocals from Phil and fast, chugging riffs, mixed with great drumming."Cemetery Gates" is a beautiful, Southern-rock styled ballad-turned-rocker with melodic acoustic passages, some beautiful singing and then hardcore screeching by Phil, an eerie electric riff and an amazing guitar solo. A definitely masterpiece."Domination" is a cross between fast grooves and chugging melodies, with one of Dimebag Darrell's greatest guitar solos and awesome verses sung by Phil."Shattered" is another song in speed-metal territory, with fast, complex riffs and some of Phil's greatest upper-range singing around. A real feast for a thrasher!"Medicine Man" has some cool basswork, a catchy groove and deep singing by Phil, along with another signature heavy chorus!"The Sleep" is the second epic-ballad-turned-rocker, after "Cemetery Gates". Featuring an exotic chord strum, dark, horror-themed lyrics and more deep, melodic singing by Phil, like on "Cemetery Gates", this is another great one!"The Art of Shredding" closes the album with some more great riffage and a grooving bassline, high-pitched screaming from Phil and a somewhat random frenzy towards the end, that rocks out until the end.As you notice, I didn't rate "Clash With Reality" or "Message In Blood", because I really don't listen to those two much, even though they're still great songs. Well, to summarize my review, if you want a great metal album with lots of talent, grooves and songwriting, "Cowboys From Hell" is a great choice. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Modern-day horror isn't exactly known for being incredibly innovative. Fortunately, "Days of Darkness" proves to be a shock treat. Even if it isn't the most groundbreaking film of its genre, I still think it's an extremely well-written movie with some real spook moments.Basically, a comet has fallen to Earth, and for some reason people are turning into zombies. A fortunate few are hiding out at some sort of base, occasionally getting into heart-pounding squalls with the zombies.What makes this movie so interesting is how it's able to focus on the characters (some more likeable than others), and still have moments that will make you jump, shudder, etc.I noticed a solid Romero influence on this movie, which is equally as impressive as the emotional content and zombie terror. There are several, major twists in the plot, but it's all worth it for the ending, in my opinion. For a newer, zombie movie, this one really delivers, and I'm glad I checked it out. Enjoy the zombie-fest, thanks for the time, and peace.

Being over 35 years old and having almost no recognition among horror fans around my age group, "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is the definition of a classic sleeper movie. However, don't let the fact that this movie is buried under generations of more popular and well-known movies stop you from checking it out. "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is criminally underrated, and will grab your interest with its amazing location, haunting atmosphere, enticing characters and ever-thickening plot.Taking place in the beautiful Connecticut countryside, Jessica and friends take some free time after Jessica has been released from a mental hospital. Coming across a mysterious, albeit quite attractive lady, they all share the house on the lakeside before the ever chilling and eerie series of events sets in. Being a psychological horror film that pre-dates "The Shining", "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is original in every sense of the word, and a film far beyond its time, having been made in 1971. The dark and mysterious atmosphere is captivating and at times, almost quite surreal, which makes for a fantastic tone to the movie. The setting of the house and the lake, and all the surrounding scenery adds to the optical beauty, making for some great landscapes for such chilling, psychological events to take place.Overall, this is a great and extremely underrated psychological horror movie that's almost perfect. The only thing I wish would have been changed is the ending; it feels as though the ending was almost rushed and never given a proper conclusion. The other thing that bugs me is not about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The only thing the disc contains is the movie, the scene selection, and the language selection. It's really a loss that there's no special features included on this disc, because I love looking at the special features after a movie. Also, it's a loss because "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is a movie where the bonus material may have been really interesting, especially regarding the nature of the film, how unknown the actors are and how the movie seemed to disappear under years of other horror films.Be that as it may, "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is an awesome horror movie that should be viewed by anybody interested in surreal, atmospheric horror or psychological horror films. Enjoy this classic in time for Halloween, too! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Ichi The Killer" is a movie that involves gang member Kakihara and his target Ichi, who is, yes, a killer, but also enjoys weekend sitting under a blanket in his bedroom playing his PlayStation. Go figure!Now, I will say that "Ichi The Killer" is one of the GORIEST movies that has come across my TV screen. I won't give away any of the details, but if you want them, personalize a request in the comment section below and I'll give you the what's-what, and believe me, there's a lotta WHAT in this movie! HOWEVER..."Ichi The Killer" is NOT a "horror" movie. It's a very ironic movie with odd humor, unexpected laughs, and even some dark drama as only the Japanese can do. A personal favorite comedic moment is when Kakihara's squad is walking down the street, but Kakihara stuck a board of wood to one dude's shoe, so it sticks out like a sore thumb! Ironic, indeed!So this movie is a cross between a gang-exploitation, drama, comedy and nonstop bloody, gory, violent action!I love that the movie doesn't have to take itself seriously to be a great movie. "Ichi The Killer" as bloody and violent as it is, can be a very fun movie and an interesting twist on your Friday night featurette.Basically, imagine the deranged, messed-up humor of the opening, train station scene in "Suicide Circle", set it to a gang members movie and there you go! Japanese gangsploitation done right! Enjoy, and don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing at least once! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Okay so let's just put it on the table right from the start: "Blood Feast" has cheesy characters, a B-movie level plot and is hardly over an hour. BUT! For those seeking low-budget, high-quality entertainment, this is a movie for your eyes to feast upon. Being well over 40 years old, it's interesting to think how gory and vicious this was considered back in the early '60s. Technically, this can be considered the first slasher film, and is DEFINITELY the first splatter film, so for the true horror fans, this is an essential view!For fans of the cheesy yet enjoyable horror films, this one will be a real gem. Despite the acting and writing, (although I thought the bad acting made the villain twice as enjoyable,) the low-budget aspect makes it humorous, and the gore is, of course, awesome! Plus, the fact that the movie is pretty short makes it all the more enjoyable, because it suits the general feel of the film. Don't expect something big and beautiful, but be prepared for some low-budget gold! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Come Clarity" is actually my first album by In Flames, but I can guarantee all readers here that it won't be my last. I heard a few of their songs online at some point, but then forgot about them after a while. Then, a while back when I was at the music store, I had some extra money and was curious to get into a new band. In Flames was one that had always sparked my curiosity, and revisiting their material after forgetting it would be a good reason to get something of theirs. So of course, I picked up "Come Clarity".This album has the elements of a truly great melodic death metal album. The bludgeoning but beautiful guitar riffs, the fast, pounding drums, the rough, almost screaming vocals, the huge-sounding, beautiful choruses and the harmonized guitar lines. Such standout tracks are "Take This Life" and "Vacuum", both of which have aggressive verses but break into beautiful, melodic choruses. Then we have some clean guitar melodies opening the title track and some instrumental experimentation on "Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone".Overall, this is a great metal album and shows that In Flames is one of the few, true metal bands that remain in the modern day. I would have given this album a full, five-star rating, but I crave more guitar solos with my metal, and this album has less than the usual amount of solos I want. However, all in all, this is a great album for fans of In Flames, or melodic death metal in general. Be sure to pick it up and play it loud! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although its debatable what was truly the first ever slasher film (1960's "Peeping Tom" gave the perspective of the murderer, and 1963's "Blood Feast" had the gory serial killings), "Black Christmas" is certainly up there with the big daddies of early horror films that influenced generations and generations of horror movies. I guess there is no real ONE film that created or perfected the slasher genre, but "Black Christmas" is an entertaining and chilling claustrophobic film that helped set the stage for many films to follow.One thing very interesting about the movie is how it works with so much minimalism. There is hardly a drop of blood throughout the movie, and (SPOILER!!!!) you don't find out who the killer is, but the way it combines the setting, atmosphere, acting and series of events so consistent makes it very watchable and enjoyable. Both influential and brilliant, this movie is an essential for horror fans! Thanks for the time, and peace.

With this being the second year of my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of Halloween" list for the month of October, I figured I'd kick it off with an old-school film, an underrated gem in the slasher sub-genre known as Madman. With the explosion of slasher films and their sequels coming from the late '70s through the '80s, it's easy to see how some might have gotten forgotten (classics such as The Burning, The Prowler, and this film!). However, "Madman" has what it takes to stand with the best of them from the Golden Era of Horror.This movie comes with the full package: A cast of likable characters that are portrayed by good actors, a creepy supernatural element set in a desolate environment and naturally some excellent gore scenes. For a very worthy addition to anybody's library of fun, entertaining and bloodsoaked slasher-film classics, "Madman" should prove a good view! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Dio is definitely a promiment name in the genre of metal. Whether it was Black Sabbath, Rainbow, or his own band, Dio, Ronnie James Dio has showed us what an excellent vocalist and showman he truly is. "The Very Beast of Dio" offers 16 classics from the band Dio. Granted, a dual-disc compilation would have better summarized up the astounding band's career, but the advantage of this collection being single-disc is that it gives you a nice offering of the band's songs without giving away too much of the original albums, at least that's what I think.We get such powerhouses rockers as "Stand Up and Shout", "We Rock", a live version of "Man on the Silver Mountain", originally a song from Dio-era Rainbow, and the godly "Holy Diver". All songs showcases fiery riffs, blazing guitar solos, pounding drums (I love Vinny Appice's snapping snare drum sound!), and of course, Ronnie James Dio's amazing, powerful, melodic voice.Then we get such classics that have influenced more recent power metal bands with dominant keyboard lines, such as "Mystery" "Hungry For Heaven" and the classic "Rainbow In The Dark". More recent, pummeling songs such as "Lock Up The Wolves" and "Strange Highways" are also included.In addition to the great songs, that come at a great price I might add, we get nice liner notes, band photos and song credits in the booklet. All of this is a great package and a great introduction to the amazing Dio! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"British Steel" is an important part of Judas Priest's career, because it marked an obvious change in their sound, and even image. Don't get me wrong, though, their '70s output was awesome, with such classics as "Stained Class", "Sin After Sin" and "Hellbent For Leather". But "British Steel" was the album where Priest put a new spin on their sound. As opposed to the bluesier, more psychedelic/acid-rock sound of their '70s classics, "British Steel" was a pure metal release, and you can hear this album's influence in such bands as Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax.Here's a list of the songs and how I feel about them:"Rapid Fire": A fast, chugging riff and a great drum intro kick off this speed-metal masterpiece. Lots of epic, action-based lyrics and some great guitar trade-offs between Glenn Tipton and KK Downing. One of my favorite songs on the album."Metal Gods": More great, heavy riffs, a passionate guitar solo and a great combo of Rob's phenomonal vocals and sci-fi lyrics."Breaking The Law": A legendary riff and sing-a-long chorus, this is a song that broke Judas Priest into the Top 40. Still a classic after repeated listens."Grinder": A slower and heavier song with sleazier, in a good way, lyrics, and another staple of the album."United": An uplifting, shout-a-long anthem, one of the best rock/ metal anthems ever written."You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise": An underrated, introspective song."Living After Midnight": A catchy, three-and-a-half minute fist pumper with awesome riffs, verses and an extremely cool guitar solo."The Rage": The complete opposite feel of the last song, this one does contain a cool bassline and some experimental textures. Although this song is one I wouldn't listen to when I'm feeling good, it does show Judas Priest maturing in their songwriting talent."Steeler": An adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced classic with more classic guitar work, singing and lyrics. An excellent way to close the album.The remastered album also contains "Red White and Blue", a power ballad that I personally love, though think it's ironic that Judas Priest, a British band, would write a song about American pride. Oh well, no harm done. There's also a live version of "Grinder".Overall:"British Steel" is an undisputable metal classic that marked an important spot in Judas Priest's history. Some may not like this album as much as others, but all the same, this is one of the best albums in metal. I highly recommend it, as well as the rest of Judas Priest's catalogue, as they are one of my all-time favorite metal bands. Well, that about wraps up this review! Thanks for the time, and peace.

I'm usually not a follower of video games, or video games-turned-movies, but being the zombie fanatic I am, I decided I should check out "House of the Dead". Considering the amount of video games turned movies Uwe Boll has done, he really seems to have taken movie-making and made it less of an art-form of expression and more of a gimmick. That bothers me as an artist. That aside, here's my opinion of "House of the Dead".THE GOOD:- Lots of gore, a staple of zombie films.- Lots of high-energy, cheesy action for fans of B-movies.- The techno soundtrack featured here and there throughout the film is quite good for electronica fans.- There are a few good jokes thrown in there that round off the cheesy B-movie atmosphere of this film. ("That's Spanish for death in case you don't speak Mexican!" comes to mind.)- I give the movie props for having the idea of putting in swimming zombies in here. I don't think I've seen that before in a movie so there's a little bit of originality snuck in here.THE BAD:- This movie is absolutely riddled with clips from the video game that serves as nothing but filler. This gets old fast and there's really no need for it.- There's a complete overkill of freeze-frame shots that also comes across as unnecessary momentary filler, and makes it seem as if the film is almost parodying itself. The same CAN be said for the excessive slow-motion clips, but those aren't as annoying as the overly-indulgent freeze-frame shots.- When someone dies in action, the screen fades to red as if it's in a video game. This really takes away from the life-likeness of the movie and makes it more gimmicky.- Not too major, but the character Alicia seems to have a stick up her booty the whole movie. I really just wanted to kick her and shut her mouth.- The narration at the beginning is just terrible.In short, if you want a high-action, high-gore, entertaining, cheesy B-movie where you can leave your brains at the door and just have a few laughs, "House of the Dead" is should be a candidate. It isn't perfect, but considering this came from the same decade that gave us such horrible films as "Drag Me To Hell" and the remakes of "Halloween" and "I Spit On Your Grave", you could certainly do much, much worse. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"The Thing" stars Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley and is directed by John Carpenter. Right from the getgo, you know that this is going to be an awesome horror movie. And if that's what you guessed, well you are indeed correct! "The Thing" is a movie that's the epitome of paranoia and claustrophobia. The movie takes place among the barren landscapes of Antarctica, and focuses around twelve men secluded in a laboratory in the middle of the frost and snow. Then of course, comes the mysterious threat of the Thing!There are so many good points of this movie, it's hard to pick just a few highlights. "The Thing" is one of those movies where everything is done right. From the characters, who are all likeable, down-to-earth men that develop their different personalities over the course of the movie. Then of course the ever-intensifying atmosphere of the film, which grows and thickens with the growing threat of the mysterious Thing. The setting is also great, showing the terror of being isolated in an area with something dangerous in your midst. And probably most apparent is the absolute brilliance of the special effects! Nowadays, it's not common to find a movie with such great special effects, as a good deal of would-be great modern horror flicks are ruined by half-done CGI. Don't worry here, though, because "The Thing" is fully loaded with awesome special effects that'll have you loving the movie even more!Overall, "The Thing" is, as I previously mentioned, one of those movies where basically everything is simply done right. I certainly think that this movie would earn its spot among the highest-ranked horror films of all time, and is a movie that is still enjoyable no matter how much it ages, or how many times you watch it. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

George A. Romero's Day of the Dead is a hands-down zombie classic that is criminally underrated, not only in comparison to "Night of the Living Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead" but as a zombie movie itself. Of course, this doesn't mean it's unheard of, look at all the great reviews it's gotten! But "Day of the Dead" is quite the contrast to "Dawn of the Dead", for several reasons.1) "Dawn of the Dead" was a two-hour cross between zombie gore and social satire. It looked at the sociality of consumerism and exploited it, and added the gore of the undead at multiple times.Now, "Day of the Dead" isn't so much about social satire as it is about character development. That's something you don't see too often in horror movies, as horror is about what happens to you, but the character development works great here. Also, "Day of the Dead" is only 90 minutes, so it didn't aim to be the social epic "Dawn..." was.2) "Dawn of the Dead" did something similar to "Night of the Living Dead". It left the zombies only as the ravenous monsters that were out to attack and munch. Even so, I gotta admit, it was something else to see the blue Hare Krshna zombie in "Dawn..."!In "Day of the Dead", a zombie is treated as a full-fledged character, "Bub". He picks up traits and habits he did in life before he got turned into a zombie, and the doctor here studies Bub's habits and treats him as a friend and a lab specimen.3) "Dawn of the Dead", as previously mentioned, has gore all throughout, in between the comedic scenes and social satirism."Day of the Dead" waits until the last fifteen minutes for the zombie outbreak to rip everything apart!So that's the difference between DAWN and DAY. How does DAY do on it's own? Well, I know my review's already pretty long, but READ ON!DAY OF THE DEAD takes place at an underground military base in the middle of the day, with lots of characters that eventually develop themselves. As the movie progresses, you discover which characters you like...and which character you wouldn't mind see get their intestines eaten.As I said, the gore doesn't fully kick in until the last 15 minutes, but when THAT happens...WATCH OUT! Seeing the guy getting literally ripped in half by the zombies and consumed is totally awesome, and the gore you'd expect from special effects wizard Tom Savini!Now, the movie ends on a positive note, a little brighter than NIGHT and DAWN, a little more hopeful, indeed. The all-of-a-sudden happy ending kinda comes outta nowhere, but at least it makes sense to the plot.So, what are you waiting for? Don't miss out on this zombie classic! It's one of the defining moments in zombie movie history! Though it isn't as critically acclaimed or remembered as DAWN, DAY OF THE DEAD definitely delivers! Get your piece of flesh today! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Sometimes, really good things happen by coincidence. Before I actually review "Images and Words", an album of epic magnitudes, I would like to explain my discovery of Dream Theater.While listening to AOL Radio, I clicked to, I believe the progressive station, and heard the "Rover/ Achilles Last Stand/ The Song Remains The Same" seven and a half minute medley from Dream Theater's mostly-covers album, "A Change of Seasons". Not knowing the glorious band I was about to get into, I bought that album and instantly loved it (I mean, come on, a 23-minute title track!)It had been quite some time before I would soon rediscover my love for Dream Theater. Every now and again, I would look at lists of musicians and how high they rank, alongside bands and albums, and for each, Dream Theater ranked high (I read somewhere "Images and Words" ranked #2 on a list of the greatest progressive metal albums of all time). Deciding it couldn't hurt to revisit the band, and after listening to samples of "Pull Me Under", "Another Day", and I believe "Metropolis Part 1", (though I can't remember my reactions to the online previews), I bought it one day.I didn't really know how I would feel after I listened to the album. However, I did know two things: 1) In an album, I look for the musical chops that I love and that will keep me hooked. 2) I knew what made me want to LISTEN to something.That's the question I often consider when looking at an album. What about it will make me want to listen? Is it the clever use of lyrics that keep me puzzled and searching for the answers? Is it the untouchable talent that leaves me breathless (especially considering I am a multi-instrumentalist). Or is it the overall quality of something that keeps me listening to it?Well, one night I sat down on my bed and played this album, and then it hit me: Dream Theater is an excellent band with dazzling songwriting, furious musical talent, and, to solve my own (problem may be overstating it, so I'll say concern), that it made me want to listen!The way everything came at me was breathtaking! From the album jacket itself, the bright colors of the pictures, that flaming heart in a mansion's bedroom, the band's picture inside it what appears to be some coliseum, and the summery glow behind them. The vivid images easily accompany the music itself.Ahh, there it is: the music itself. John Petrucci's blazing, and I mean BLAZING, guitar work. Eddie Van Halen and Yngwie J. Malmsteen may have invented the shred-solo technique, but John Petrucci gives many guitarists competition, as he displays intricate riffing, speedy solos, catchy hooks, and goes the whole, nine yards for us. John Myung, while not as dominant as John Petrucci, runs a tight ship, as well, displaying energetic basswork that will satisfy people who want to hear that. From the hammer-on solo (how many bassists have ever recorded THAT?!), to his overall basslines, he is a great musician.Kevin Moore, though he didn't last, made a serious impression while still with Dream Theater. In just eight songs, he can prove that he can do it all. Dreamy, haunting piano lines, warm, lush synth solos (ahhh, that just says it all), and just general virtuoso skills on the keyboard. Mike Portnoy is an animal on the drumset. He pounds those big ol' plates like there's no tomorrow. This guy has some stunning chops, and yet, I feel sorry for the fact that he has an alcohol problem. You're in our thoughts, Mike. Anyway, as a musician, he's nothing short of magnificent.And finally, there's the dramatic, ever-quotable James LaBrie. From his soaring, almost operatic vocals to his cool bounce-and-sway rhythm, he is the ideal frontman for a band like Dream Theater. I can hardly imagine them with a different lead singer, and can hardly imagine James LaBrie being any more perfect in a different band. When you put these five musicians together, you get the one-of-a-kind Dream Theater."Pull Me Under": A progressive opener that is perfect for kicking off an awesome album, with lyrics that say the person talking basically accepts death and all it brings. The heavy guitars and drums drive this song throughout, and James' repeated, "Pull me under", during the chorus, shows the hypnotic effects a song like this will leave on you. A great display of lyrics keep rolling, the instruments fire all of their guns at once (to quote Steppenwolf's "Born To Be Wild") and the song keeps it explosion at large until...everything stops! An amazing, eight-minute masterpiece stops on the spur of a moment, what an unusual concept!"Another Day": Ooooh, there's a lot to say about this song. In terms of time, it's shorter than "Pull Me Under", at four and a half minutes. Lyrically, its focus is to keep faith and spirit and don't give up, hence the lyric, "so die another day". The songwriting on this untouchable song is in a balladic style. The acoustic-to-electric style of guitar-playing, a songwriting technique that is always used but never getting old, works perfectly, the lovely soprano sax guest musician provides two great solos and some unbelievably beautiful saxophone lines. Uhhh, it just displays the summery tinge this album can't help but contain. It makes me wanna pick up my own sax again (though I play alto), and learn this stuff again! James put his soaring vocals to use to just add more and more to the beauty of this. His vocal lines make me feel like I'm floating on a cloud in heaven! And of course, Kevin Moore's keyboards perfectly accompany this wonderful masterpiece. Such a beautiful song, man, that's just about the best way to sum it up!"Take The Time": Another longer, progressive song, but nothing short of stunning, these lyrics are a bit more literal, telling you to take things as they come. It was also written as a bit of a autobiographical thing, describing how the guys in Dream Theater felt about all that was going on in their lives."Surrounded": A five-and-a-half minute work of absolute art! The first thing I noticed about this song is the synthesizer line taken from the Styx song "Loreli", that opens this song. There's just so much to love about this song, it's nearly impossible to describe! However, it's the perfect type of song to end your night listening to before you go to sleep. Lyrically, it seems to talk about refreshing your spirit, but I can't say too specifically the meaning of all the lyrics. However, this song will prove to be absolutely magnificent, along with all the others!"Metropolis, Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper": A preview to the '99 album, "Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory". However, without delving too deeply into that, I'll describe this song. First off, it's one of the greatest metal songs of all time, period. It has that certain atmosphere, hard to describe what it is, but the opening, keyboard work gives you that feel that something great is about to approach. Then comes in John Petrucci's monstrous, chugging riffs, Mike's drums slam into it, and the whole song explodes into a nine and a half minute musical treasure! Musical chops all over the place, dramatic use of vocals, it paints such an interesting scene that you really want to know more about. It seems to go on and on like a road filled with fantastic journeys, because, well, that's what this album is. On that note, you might wanna check out, "Scenes From A Memory" to conclude this amazing tale. What a rocker this thing is, and completely artistic at the same time!"Under A Glass Moon": This is one of my favorite songs on the album. Well, that's a bit of an ironic statement, because I absolutely adore all songs on this epic piece of art. Anyway, the opening chord progression gives the song a very night-time atmospheric feel to it, just so incredible. Then the rest of the song comes in and another great work is born! I especially love the part of the song where the drums speed up and James sings, "Outside the soundness of your mind/ Bathing your soul in silver tears/ Beneath a blackened, summer sky/ Praying for time to disappear". Oooh, the combination of the music and James' voice just sends a feeling to you that makes you grasp the huge proportions of it all. This seven-minute wonder has an enormous feel to it, and contains a stupendously awesome guitar solo by John Petrucci. I can't believe the critics at, I believe Rolling Stone, put it at #98 (but then again, these are the same critics at listed Eddie Van Halen at #70 of the greatest rock guitarists). Anyway, this song totally rocks, I mean, you can just feel John Petrucci GRIND out that guitar work, SHRED out those solos. The practically overwhelming experience of this, after "Metropolis, Part 1", is sure to deliver sixteen and a half minute of undoubted bliss. And, to some extent, this is a religious song, like "Surrounded". It seems as though somebody has died and they are going to heaven, hence the lyric, "Night awaits the lamb's arrival" and "By your hand, I've awakened/ Bear this honor in my name"."Wait For Sleep": A two and a half minute ballad completely written by Kevin Moore, about a female friend of his who felt a bit empty inside and needed something good to believe in. The haunting, yet romantic piano line perfect accompanies the incoming string section, and James adds a bounce with his vocal rhythm that incorporates an even greater feel to the song."Learning To Live": Ahhh, the closer of a dynamic album, and at eleven and a half minutes, it's sure to last. The keyboards open, the instruments progress, and James tells the tale of, in my opinion and the opinions of others, learning to live with AIDS. This song may also just mean living with the everyday troubles life gives you, but lines like, "The 90s bring new questions/ New solutions to be found/ I fell in love to be let down", and "Once you're touched you stand alone/ To face the bitter fight/ Once I reached for love/ And now I reach for life". In all honesty, it's a sad topic, but it's delivered in such a beautiful way, this song, though it may actually drag on in some areas, is just dynamic and is a great way to end an album on this level.The great thing about "Images and Words" is that it brings out my reflective, sensetive side, while still being able to also draw out the side of me that can listen to an eight-minute rocker. It explores different emotions with different approaches, yet Dream Theater has a very noticeable style that sticks out when compared to other bands of their (slightly recent) time frame. There's a lot to love about this album, A LOT, I mean it. I don't know if any reviews can cover the vastness this album covers, but I did my best to describe with a leviathan of a musical masterpiece "Images and Words" is. There's really no other album like it, so if you get, and I really hope you do, cherish it for what it is, all the beauty in the images (album booklet) and words (the music itself), and together, how it paints such a stunning picture.If you like music with incredible talent, deep, epic meaning and the power of, say, a modified Rush, "Images and Words" may just be that album. It seems to be just so much to describe, but I, both as a musician and a music-lover (and I can say that I've heard quite a few acts out there), I give kudos to this album without a doubt, as it is truly worthy of a five-star rating. For your enjoyment, get this, as I know you'll love it as much as I do.

Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of metalcore/deathcore/hardcore, etc. whatever it's called nowadays. The only bands in that genre I really like are the ones that aim for to be a little more unique than the other bands in this endless flood of artists. For example, the incredibly technical August Burns Red, or the wildly experimental and fun Between The Buried and Me.What makes As Blood Runs Black such a great band is that they push themselves! They don't just want to make "another album" and they don't want to "just get by" as another band. Within the first 20 seconds of this CD, I knew these guys were out to be more than just mediocre. These guys are proving that they're out for great things.All the songs have great, intense, metal riffs, and just about all of these riffs are pretty complex and quite intricate. In fact, there are times on this album where ABRB remind me of Children of Bodom, and that's a good thing, because Children of Bodom are one of my favorite metal bands. The breakdowns are also great because they are off-time and technical, much like the breakdowns of August Burns Red. The screaming vocals are also quite passionate and the vocalist is definitely suitable for a band of this energy and intensity. And finally, the drumming. OH SNAP! Lech is by far one of the most intense drummers of extreme metal. He just pushes himself so far that it's astounding. He's definitely a great drummer and is a vital part in obtaining As Blood Runs Black's sound.This is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through and love every second of. From the fiery headbangers of "In Dying Days", "Hester Prynne" and "My Fears Have Become Phobias" to the amazingly beautiful guitar-and-bass instrumental "Pouring Reign", this album is great. I can't wait for As Blood Runs Black to come out with a new album, because when such talented and inspired musicians as themselves really put the effort into the music, it comes out great. And this album goes to show it! Thanks for the time, and peace.

While I admit, there's nothing new, innovative or different about The Red Shore, they do make good music. They're talented musicians, good songwriters and this EP is a quick blast of heavy stuff. Some cool breakdowns, some intricate guitar riffs, great vocals, and powerful drumming. Don't go out of your way to get it, but buy/download it if it's available. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Being a huge fan of both "Ten Thousand Fists" and "Indestructible", it's interesting to compare how Disturbed has grown with those albums in comparison to this one, "Believe". I think that the band grew a lot since this album, but all in all, "Believe" is still a good hard-rock album.I'm glad that I decided to listen to this album all the way through, because about halfway through I thought that all the songs were beginning to sound mediocre. Never mind that they were beginning to sound similar, because Disturbed songs can tend to sound similar to each other. However, I give this 3.5 out of 5 stars because even though the middle, 4 songs were weaker than the first and last 4, the first and last 4 were indeed good."Prayer" and "Liberate" are the two big hits off the album, both containing catchy rock grooves, nice melodies and heavy guitar riffs and drums. "Awaken" has some nice heavy guitar riffs throughout, with softer verses that build up, showing the band has skilled songwriting. The title track, "Believe", has a 3/4 rhythm, which gives the song a nice swaying feel to it and David's vocals are absolutely beautiful and melodic! But probably the biggest and certainly most pleasant surprise is the closing song, "Darkness". With most of the album being quite heavy, this ballad, featuring a strings section and a piano, with some of David's absolute best vocals ever...this song is a true work of musical art!So while this album isn't Disturbed's best, it's certainly got quite a few songs on it that will be a great listen! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Judging by the fact that the reviews for this movie are more mixed than say, "Tremors" or "Tremors 2: Aftershocks", "Tremors 3: Back To Perfection" seems to be sort of the odd man out among the "Tremors" series. However, if you've got it in you to enjoy a campy monster-horror movie with a good dose of comedy, "Tremors 3" will definitely be enjoyable!Fred Ward is back to star in this movie, full of the high-action, explosion-heavy thrils of the first two movies. And like in the first two of the series, the Graboids change form, which I personally like, because it adds an exciting twist to each movie. In this case, they are heat-seeking flying beasts, humorously named A##-blasters (I mean come on, you HAVE to appreciate that!). Different as they may be from the Graboids in the first two movies, these ones are just as exciting and entertaining. And at about 1 hour, 40 minutes, the movie is long enough to keep you into it, but not so long that you lose your interest.Combining the thrill and fun of this movie with the extra features on the disc, this DVD is highly recommended, especially if you get it in the "Tremors 4-Pack". And be sure to catch it in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Note: This is actually the second version of my review. Because I wanted to change the rating but couldn't, I simply rewrote it.I've been listening to Dragonforce for about two years now, and ever since I got into them, they've been one of my favorite bands. "Inhuman Rampage" demonstrates their truly unique sound. There are some differences between this album and their previous release, "Sonic Firestorm". For one, this album shows more variety. There's more experimenting on this album, including more keyboard usage than SF, some heavier riffs and the fact that this seems to be something of a concept album, which makes it even more fun.If you're wondering, Dragonforce's sound is distinguished by their twin lead guitars, epic keyboard melodies, soaring vocals, and of course, blistering solos, both on the guitars and keys. Plus, you can often hear ZP singing a sort of choral echo, popularized by Queen, thank you Freddy Mercury."Through The Fire and Flames": The album starts off with some extremely fast flamenco guitar playing, then goes into a blindingly fast riff. The song is full of amazing solos, awesome chops and sing-a-long verses, hooks and choruses. A great way to start off the album."Revolution Deathsquad": An eight-minute song that shows how this album is more experimental. There's a brief thrash riff in here, fast soloing in an odd scale (either harmonic minor or melodic minor, I believe), and another great chorus."Storming The Burning Fields": More blazing fast riffs and experimenting here, which makes this song lots of fun. Between the creepy keyboard passages and tremolo picking breakdown, this song is yet another great epic-anthem."Operation Ground and Pound": Probably my favorite song off the album. It starts off with a great synthesizer line, goes into a drumroll, and another set of blistering riffs. Some of the most beautiful melodies on the album are featured in this song, alongside some more great soloing, and singing. This song has a very adventurous tone, which I dig!"Body Breakdown": If not melancholy, this song is definitely dramatic. Interesing use of keyboard/guitar effects during the verses along the rapid drumbeat. ZP does more awesome signing here, naturally, and this song features an incredible bass-guitar lead, courtesy of ex-Dragonforce member Adrian Lambert."Cry for Eternity": Lots of great keyboard work here, along with an awesome tapping-guitar opening, and obviously, another great chorus. Also the longest song on the album, at over eight minutes long."The Flame of Youth": This one is set in an unusual key for a power metal song. Of course, though, there are more great riffs and solos, with catchy verses and shredding harmonies."Trail of Broken Hearts": The six-minute, closing power ballad of the album. No real shredding guitars here, but there is some great soloing, alongside the piano and synthesizer work. Plus, the chorus is as good as it can get for a power ballad. Awesome way to close the album.So, "Inhuman Rampage" is definitely an awesome album. If you're into rock or metal of any form, love great melodies or awesome guitar work, this is one not to miss! Get it, love it, and be happy! By the way, it's good to see Dragonforce getting exposure due to the Guitar Hero series. I hope to see them on tour this summer, and I'm waiting for their fourth album, available August 25th, as I've heard. Unleash the music and open the floodgates of summer! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Welcome again my lovers of horror, and for those that have been keeping up with my horror movie reviews. This time around, after having already reviewed "The Prowler" and "The Burning" I figure I might as well go back to the '80s for another forgotten fan-favorite of the slasher film subgenre known as "Pieces".I came across this movie by coincidence online, and figured I might as well watch it since I had a good 90 minutes of free time. Now, having seen many slasher films, including all EIGHT (count 'em, EIGHT) of the original Friday the 13th films, and the previously mentioned "The Prowler" and "The Burning", I know my slasher-horror. So I know the feeling of half-satisfaction in my movie lover's gut isn't just indigestion...what we have here is a half-done slasher film.Don't get me wrong, "Pieces" isn't a throwaway movie. There's a sufficient amount of stuff to enjoy here. We got:-A considerable amount of blood and gore, necessary with basically any slasher film, so it does it's job there.-Several cases of nudity, also an almost obligatory factor of slashers.-An opening that grabs your attention, which is a great move on the director's and writer's side.-A rather hilarious scene featuring one of the most stereotypical Asian guys I've ever seen... the accent, the martial arts skills, the attitude, it's priceless!-An ending that makes you go OH SNAP!So we do have plenty of good aspects about this movie, so what gives it the 3-star rating? Well I thought a lot of this movie moved at a rather slow pace. The characters all felt pretty stereotypical, and even though I love myself a good police story, the one presented here wasn't all that exciting. Save the investigative cops for the "Saw" series!Well, that about wraps up this review. Overall, "Pieces" is not a bad movie by any means, but coming from a generation that brought us the Friday the 13th and Halloween films, it's been outshined pretty easily. Watch it if you're a slasher film lover and want to watch all the horror movies remembered in the hearts of us gorehounds! Thanks for the time, and peace. (or should I say...Pieces!)

Love them or hate them, Bring Me The Horizon made it big with this album. "Count Your Blessings" is a modern-day slab of honest, adolescent adrenaline, complete with furious, technical riffs, pounding drums, heavy-as-ever breakdowns, and ever-quotable lyrics. "Pray For Plagues" features some incredibly technical riffs and a very catchy breakdown, a great song that made helped jettison them up the level of recognition they're at. Oli Sykes' vocals may take some getting used to, but up until that point, the music itself is still very enjoyable. "For Stevie Wonder's Eyes Only" features great lyrics that are pretty poetic, some very cool riffs and some of Oli's edgiest vocals towards the end. "Tell Slater..." features an awesome, speed-metal opening with a whammy-bar solo, and some awesome, melodic super-heavy riffs. "A Lot Like Vegas" is my possibly favorite song on the album, featuring a simple but flawless breakdown, some dimished-scale riffs and a great, passionate guitar solo, the sort of stuff to blast while cruising down the highway at night! "Slow Dance" is a nice change of pace, featuring a ballad-tempo and some slower, majestic guitars. Great atmosphere here, I wish this song was longer!I could keep going on about the songs, but you get the idea: if you're into really heavy, but still melodic stuff, "Count Your Blessings" should indeed satisfy. A fair warning, though, "Suicide Season" sounds a lot different from this album, but if you're curious, pick that up, too. CYB is a great album, in whatever sub-genre you would want to put Bring Me The Horizon in. Regardless, for fans of this sort of stuff, it's a hands-down essential. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I didn't get into Morbid Angel right away, but after hearing one of their songs in the movie "Night of the Demons Part 2" (which is a fantastic horror/comedy by the way!), I got sucked into their music. "Covenant" is an amazing album overall, from the vocals to the musicianship to the songwriting. Certainly a hallmark for extreme metal! They go from brutal blast beats and tremolo picking to slow, sludgy riffs that form a wall of crushing music, and an overall dark and old-school horror-reminiscent atmosphere that just can't be topped. Plain and simple, this album delivers some of the best death metal I've heard. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Another band that you will potentially either love or hate, Job For A Cowboy sticks their neck out there with this release. Young, crazy and showing no signs of slowing down, these guys produce pummeling song after pummeling song on "Doom". The songwriting formula is typical of this style of music, it's not verse-chorus-verse, rather, proceeding riff after riff, verse after verse. Therefore, the setup is quite different from formats more common in metal, such as the songwriting styles of Metallica, Slayer, In Flames, etc. This may take some getting used to for people, but the music itself is great. Technical, ten-ton riffs, madman drumming, vicious vocals all around. For those who don't like pig squeals (BREE-BREE vocals) you might not dig this so much, but for those who don't mind getting a little nutty with their extreme music, "Doom" should be a good blast of insanely heavy music. Against, Job For A Cowboy is kind of one of those love 'em or hate 'em type of bands, but if you're open to some different stuff, this should hopefully prove to be an enjoyable burst of death metal/deathcore. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I know a lot about this album has already been said but I'll go ahead and say that I agree when people say that this is one of the best '90s rock albums, and one of the best rock albums of all time. Every song on "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" is amazing, with lots of great musicianship, singing and songwriting.There's so much energy, funk and fun, this album is always great with every listen. From the amazing basslines of the legendary Flea to the in-the-pocket drumming of Chad Smith, the crooning vocals alongside the sometimes profound but in this case quite often naughty lyrics by the amazing Anthony Keidis and funky lead guitar lines of the awesome John Frusciante. Plus, Blood Sugar Sex Magik contains 17 songs at over 70 minutes, so that'll definitely keep you busy for a while!Basically, this album is an all-time classic and is just about the greatest album ever made by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you wanna get some of the best RHCP around, get this and "Californication" for starters, and definitely check out the rest of their catalogue. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Ten Thousand Fists" is Disturbed's third album, and owning this, "Believe", and "Indestructible", and hearing several songs from "The Sickness", I can say that this is a noticeably good album. Since I don't own "The Sickness" yet, I can't compare this album to that, but I will compare it to "Believe" and "Indestructible".To me the first and last four songs on "Believe" were all quite good, with the middle four being somewhat poor. "Indestructible" was overall very good, but there were a few songs that were more forgettable than the others. I'd say that "Ten Thousand Fists" is about as good as "Indestructible". The difference between these two albums is that "Indestructible" has more guitar solos, but "Ten Thousand Fists" has several, more memorable songs. Basically, "Ten Thousand Fists" and "Indestructible" are about tied, with "Believe" being behind it, and I'll form an opinion on "The Sickness" when I get that album.Now as for "Ten Thousand Fists" on its own, here's a list of the songs that seem like highlights to me:"Ten Thousand Fists": The opening headbanger, a heavy, anthemic song with crushing riffs and David Drainman's melodic, rallying cry. Lots of great vocals, a heart-pounding pre-chorus and an awesome chorus. This is a Disturbed classic, and great for opening shows with!"Just Stop": Another heavy riff-rocker featuring guitarist Dan Donegan playing some electronic keyboards. I love how Disturbed throws that into the mix to add a unique flavor to some of their songs."Guarded": Another, rather fast-paced song with more great, heavy riffs and David's vocal performance at the top of his game. A personal fave of mine on the album."Deify": A politically-driven headbanger with more electronics and heavy riffs, alongside political lyrics being belted out in David's amazing voice."Stricken": Probably my favorite and the best song on the album, with a huge, chunky guitar riff, a beautiful chorus and a stunning, beautiful, energetic guitar solo. Just a straight-up masterpiece of a metal anthem!"Overburdened": A six-minute epic, featuring a slower, heavier pace and more electronic keyboard work. A great thrill of a song and a nice addition to the other songs, which are somewhat shorter in comparison."Forgiven": This song features a nice guitar solo at the end that'll keep you listening over and over."Land of Confusion": A remake of a Genesis song, and a passionate and well-done one at that, too."Sacred Lie": A shorter, three-minute blast of crushing riffs and more great vocals."Avarice": The shortest song on the album, which is heavy and uptempo, this is an interesting way to end the album.So as you can see, most of the songs are listed as highlights, which tells a very good thing. Although "Ten Thousand Fists" lacks the guitar solos of "Indestructible", it contains the energy and spirit that "Believe" seemed to lack in some areas. There's more passion in this album, and you can tell that the band was way more fired up with this one. Overall, "Ten Thousand Fists" is a great album and a great one-two punch with "Indestructible". Be sure to get both first, before "Believe", although all three albums are great. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"House of the Dead 2" is an interesting film. What do you get when you cross aiming for a Romero-styled zombie movie with a "made for Sci-Fi channel" movie? Apparently you get this. "House of the Dead 2" has all the essentials that the first movie had: buckets of gore, lots of high-energy action scenes and those big, glorious t*ts hanging out here and there. Sure, it's not a fantastic zombie movie but it's quite good for low-budget entertainment.The only real problems I had with this movie were the storyline and the ending. Not only was the plot minimalistic, but it was too one-dimensional for me, it felt as if the writers couldn't come up with enough material for sub-plots to really fill out the film. If they had maybe supplied one or two more minor storylines, the movie would have felt more complete. Also, this felt more like a military movie than a zombie movie, as if there wasn't a solid grasp on keeping the film from waning from its intended self. Finally, the ending was pretty awkward and left an odd tone for the conclusion to a movie. Not that many zombie movies are easy to end, if they're based on a massive outbreak at least, but regardless, the ending bugged me. Check this out if you want lots of thrills and bloodshed, but don't expect a brilliant storyline. Thanks for the time, and peace.

This is actually the first Trivium album I got, a little over two years ago. Since then, I've listened to this album countless times. In fact, the first time I listened to it was all the way through, it was so good and able to keep my interest throughout. Although Trivium's first two albums are more associated with the metalcore sound, "The Crusade" takes them into a pure thrash-metal direction. Blistering guitar solos, bludgeoning riffs, breakneck drumming, meter-pushing tempos, skilled songwriting and aggressive vocals dominate the album throughout; however, I would also like to point out that there are indeed some very beautiful melodic sections and larger-than-life sounding elements incorporated, making this more than just another thrash album.I could end right there and just tell you to go out and get the album already, but that would be an injustice on my part. "The Crusade" is one of the best metal albums of this decade in my opinion, and let me explain in the rest of my review.We kick off with "Ignition", a fast and angry song about the corruption of the government and its pointless obsession with the horrors of war and violence. Going from a speed-metal verse to a softer, more mournful sounding chorus, this song has a nice contrast to it. The ending guitar drone then brings us into "Detonation", which, by the the title alone, is a sequel to the first song. This song has one of the most intense sections on the entire album, with some insane guitar soloing over some of the most brutal double-bass drumming, almost taking the band to a death metal sort of sound, but not quite. A sad and yet gorgeous second half of the song rings out with slower verses and huge-sounding guitar sweeps, making yet another nice contrast in sounds."Entrance of the Conflagration" is a moshpit-ready headbanger with some catchy-as-ever riffs, a complex mid-section and more great solos; this is one of my favorite songs on the album. "Anthem (We Are The Fire)" is right up there, too, with uplifting lyrics, amazing guitar solos and a shout-a-long chant after the solo section. This is truly an anthem! Even though it has just as much energy as the previous song, "Unrepentant" brings us back to the darker side, with lyrics about a true-life crime, just as in "Entrace of the Conflagration", the same which can be said for the next song, "And Sadness Will Sear".Taking things to a more fantasy-based nature, "Becoming The Dragon" combines more huge-sounding melodies with pure thrash-metal energy and a generally good vibe. Galloping riffs and some frantic solos are featured, along with, surprisingly, a bass solo! Paolo lets his bass ring out some interesting notes and phrases as the song fades out on a slow and interesting note. "To The Rats" is another truly awesome, three-and-a-half minute burst of energy, this one also almost treading into death-metal territory with its breakneck speed. However, a cool change is thrown in with the shout-a-long chorus, slowed down for good measures. "This World Can't Tear Us Apart" is a beautiful slow-dance styled song with some great melodies and sometimes-straightforward, sometimes-enigmatic lyrics. This song offers a nice change of pace, and is done in just three-and-a-half minutes."Tread The Floods" has a sick intro with a great buildup until the chorus, which is one of the most empowering and catchiest choruses on the entire album, and the way it's sung at the end of the song ends it perfectly. "Contempt Breeds Contamination" is the fourth song based on a true-life crime, and this is another song that utilizes the low B-string, making it a heavy number indeed. The soloing also adds to the power, this time being spread out instead of one solo after another such as in "Anthem (We Are The Fire")."The Rising" seems to be a rather underrated song, although it's honestly just as good as any other song on the album. A slower, more majestic pace is featured here in addition to another great shout-a-long chorus. Finally, the album ends with the eight-and-a-half minute instrumental epic title track, "The Crusade". An awesome way to end the album and a great song just in general, you can tell the band put a lot of effort into writing this instrumental masterpiece.Comparatively, "The Crusade" is indeed, different from "Ascendancy", going in a thrash-metal direction and having more three-and-a-half minute songs for the most part, instead of the generally longer songs on "Ascendancy". Even though the two albums are different, "The Crusade" comes highly recommended to Trivium fans, as it shows the band at the top of their game and maturing as musicians and songwriters. Well, that about wraps up this review. In short, "The Crusade" is an album that keeps metal alive today, regardless of the scene. Get this and Trivium's newest album "Shogun" if you don't have that already, and I guarantee you'll be happy. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I just finished up my reviews of "Slowly We Rot" and "Cause of Death", but this packaging is how I got both albums. These are two extreme metal classics and are worth checking out if you're a fan of heavier metal. Obituary proves what a great band they are here, with the first album, "Slowly We Rot" being rawer and more stripped-down, like an edgier Slayer, and "Cause of Death" shows the band delving into more progressive, technical and classically-influenced death metal. Both albums are truly great, and at a price like this, you're gonna be on a dark and twisted path to headbanging in no time! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Into Eternity is an interesting blend of sub-genres in metal. They combine power metal, melodic death metal, progressive death metal, even some traces of technical metal and melodic black metal; at least that what it sounds like to me ears. Now I'm relatively new to Into Eternity so I can't really compare it to any of their other albums, but to me "The Scattering of Ashes" is an all-around excellent metal album.What I love about this album is that it has such a unique sound and combines a few different styles but is still accessible to metal fans. I literally just showed my friend this band a few hours ago, and he's mostly into more American metal bands, but he instantly liked Into Eternity a lot.Stu Block is the new vocalist for the band as I heard, and to my ears he does a FANTASTIC job in his role. I've heard lots of different metal vocalist, but Stu is one of the very few, if the only one to the extent of my knowledge, that can literally go from a glass-shattering falsetto howl to a distorted death metal growl, a sinister black metal rasp to an incredibly beautiful clean voice in God knows how many octaves.The rest of the band does a stunning job. Throughout the album, we go from incredible acoustic guitar passages to sweep-picking solos, brutal riffs, power-metal licks and melodies, the whole nine yards. The bass guitar is also quite present on the album, a great positive considering a lot of metal bands tend to have a lacking bass sound. The drummer is something else, too! Some very good fills and some of the fastest double-bass this side of Derek Roddy."Severe Emotional Distress" combines brutal and intensely fast verses, especially the double-bass drums, with melodic choruses and shredding throughout. In the verses, Stu goes from a black metal shriek to a beautiful clean singing style, literally turning on a dime between every few verses, it's quite amazing. "Timeless Winter" showcases the band going into a real black metal-influenced sound, with Stu mostly using a low, gutteral voice, before going into an incredibly high-pitched falsetto scream every now and then. "Paralyzed" features some intense blast beat drumming, amazing shredding and sweep picking in the beginning, and Stu using both gutteral death vocals and an almost operatic sort of singing (Can you say King Diamond?) But my favorite track by far is "Surrounded By Night". The opening features Spanish-sounding acoustic guitars and some of the most godlike vocals done by Stu on the entire album. The song then kicks in with the bass and drums and we go into a ballad more, before the sweep-picking madness and double-bass insanity come in. The whole sound has an epic sound, before the low-end bass guitar and Stu's amazing vocal harmonies close it out.These songs, among all the others, make this album one of the best metal albums I've listened to in a while. For those interested in a band that takes a little bit from several different styles of metal and combines it into something both brutal and beautiful, this is an excellent choice. I can see basically any fan of heavy music liking this album, so be sure to find it soon! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Friday the 13th - Part 3" is one of my favorite parts of the series. Whether or not you see this in 3-D, this is a great slasher film. From the pranks and antics of Shelly to the rather goofy but entertaining hippie couple, the way cool but troublesome biker gang to Vera's death (that one was a doozy!), this movie delivers the goods. Also, this is the first "Friday the 13th" where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask! Bloody chills and late-night thrills are flying like daggers your way on...Friday the 13th! So don't miss out on a classic slasher film, check this out as soon as you can! Thanks for the time, and peace.

A friend of mine got this as a birthday present for me a while back. I've been listening to it quite a bit since then, and have been turned on to Korn pretty quickly. Listening to this album, it's easy to see the band's influence on such more recent bands such as Slipknot. However, Korn was there first, originating the use of 7-string guitars, rap-metal combinations, pushing the limits on how many times you could say the F-bomb in a song, and just being straight-up aggressive at times.From the feel good funk-rock of "Word Up!" to the psychedelic Pink Floyd cover of "Another Brick In The Wall Pts. 1-3", the collection is off to a great start. Then we get such newer headbangers as "Ya'll Want A Single" and "Right Now", which are brutal, catchy and angst-driven, even melodic at times.Then we go into the classics such as "Freak On A Leash", "A.D.I.D.A.S.", "Shoots and Ladders" and "Got The Life". The experimental, 50-second "Twist" is a nice way to lead into "A.D.I.D.A.S.", and reminds me a lot of the 50-second Alice in Chains interlude-song "Iron Gland".We also get a remix of "Freak On A Leash", and in the booklet a brief explanation of the band, what songs are from what albums, etc. Overall this is a great package and a great way to get into Korn, as it was my introduction. So put this one, turn it up loud and, as they say in "Ya'll Want a Single", BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Although I normally start with a band's earlier stuff when getting into a new musical artist, I, like many other people, got itno Incubus with their "Morning View" album some odd years ago. There was some great stuff on that album and I still love it to this day, but "S.C.I.E.N.C.E." has for me what I fantasize about as a music lover and as a musician.S.C.I.E.N.C.E. presents Incubus in a heavier, jazzier, more experimental stage of their history. Before they made it big, they made it bizarre. Before making the Top 40 rise with their songs, they made eyebrows rise with their unusual songs.When it gets right down to it, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a true masterpiece in its own way. It's got basically everything a whacked-out album could have: weird guitar chords, funky basslines, versatile and exciting drums, great and unique vocals, strange musical sounds, and overall awesome talent.Incubus prove they can hold their ground with all these elements. For example "A Certain Shade of Green" combines hardcore guitar riffs with odd, melodic soloing. "Redefine" and "Vitamin" are also hard-rockers but with a strong funk element and great basslines. "Magic Medicine" also showcases some cool drumming, sound effects and odd phrases that occasionally repeat. Then there's a personal favorite, "Nebula", which combines super-heavy riffs with beautiful, surreal melody, vocals and feel.On the other side, we get some great jazz fusion going on, from the sexy, romantic "Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)" to the happy, mellow hum-a-long "Deep Inside", which ironically also contains some great, metal riffs. And Mike's guitar work, along with the rest of the band's talent, shines all the way through.So throughout the entire album, Incubus is able to combine funk, metal, jazz fusion, progressive and alternative styles into a truly unique and one-of-a-kind work of art. Lots of great experimentation, songwriting, and fun, and this album definitely gets five stars. I kinda wish Incubus was still making music like this, but it's still fun to blast "Anna Molly" on my iPod every now and then!So if you already know some of Incubus's more, shall we say, mainstream, work, but you want to know what they'd sound like in their early days, give this a spin! It's an album I can't get enough of, and for sure one of my "desert island albums". Happy rockin'! Thanks for the time, and peace.

1) It's the best compilation that offers 35 of the band's tracks.2) It gives you an excellent look at their most successful years (1980-1992.)3) Having "Rock of Ages" will save you the trouble of getting three of their albums "High 'n' Dry" "Pyromania" and "Hysteria" due to the fact that most of the tracks from those albums are here.4) This compilation is less expensive and better than the two, separate greatest-hits packages from the band.5) While it consists a very good deal of the albums I mentioned above, it also gives you a good sample of songs from their other albums such as "On Through The Night", "Retro Active" and "Euphoria".6) It's less expensive than getting both of the other greatest-hits packages.7) The inside booklet features comments from the band members on each song, plus cool photos and a brief overview of their career.8) Because this covers their career (though mostly 80-92 like I mentioned) it shows how the band can change their sound but still sound great.9) The two CDs are packaged in the same case so you don't have to spend extra money as if it was a box set.10) Def Leppard Rocks!Overall:This is a very well put-together compilation of a great rock band. I strongly recommend getting it, it'll be hard to stop listening to it and you'll instantly love it.

Well, it's been a long time since I've written a review, but I figure I'll come back on something big and amazing, like Green Day's "Dookie". Not much is needed to be said about this album, because a lot has already been said.Even though this is one of Green Day's earlier albums, it shows that they've got skills in the songwriting department, as shown in such classics as "Chump", "Longview" and "Welcome To Paradise". As young as they were when they wrote these songs, they make them interesting and exciting. Then we have more riff-rocking anthems like the classic "Basket Case" and the melodic, shout-a-long "She". We even get to hear a bit of country influence in "Pulling Teeth"! Then comes along the mid-tempo "When I Come Around" a nice break in the faster pace of other songs.Overall, if you like this style of music, you really can't go wrong here. This is one of those albums that you can play all the way through and love every second of it. It's the sound of thundering guitars and basses, and energetic drums. It's the sound of a summer day outside in California. It's the sound of classic Green Day! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Mastodon is a band that, to me, generally gets better with every release. "Call of the Mastodon" (although wasn't their earliest release, is a collection of their earliest-recorded material) and "Remission" showcased their experimental grindcore side. They then took a step towards a more progressive-metal direction with "Leviathan", which combined stomping riffs with skilled songwriting. After that came this album, "Blood Mountain". I can't decide which is my personal favorite Mastodon album (it's generally a toss-up between this and their newest release "Crack The Skye"), but regardless, I think "Blood Mountain" is one of the best metal albums of the decade.From the breakneck-speed thrash-metal crushers of "The Wolf Is Loose" and "Crystal Skull", the band shows you that they've definitely got a metal edge. They then take it down a bit and go into "Sleeping Giant" a beautiful and melodic, slower song that delves in their more progressive and experimental side, with an almost ambient sound going on. Then we go to the instrumental "Bladecatcher", which is an absolute personal joy. This song is so crazy and experimental, it's like listening to Frank Zappa after he's had ten cups of coffee. These are just a few of the amazing songs on this album.Another great thing about "Blood Mountain" is that, as great as all the songs are, they're concise enough and not too drawn out, with most songs being about either three-and-a-half minutes long or five minutes long. I admit, I do love the 13-minute epic "Hearts Alive" off "Leviathan", but everything in the song department on this album is just right. The musicianship is also even better than on "Leviathan", and with that being said, I would like to add that Brann Dailor is one of the absolute greatest metal drummers of this decade, case closed.Overall, this album is a perfect combination of metal aggression, skilled songwriting, talented musicianship and is just an overall masterpiece. Very highly recommended, "Blood Mountain" shows us that metal is indeed alive in the 2000's, and just as ferocious as ever. Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Gold" is just about the perfect Bob Marley collection out there. It's got over 30 songs on two discs, lots of photos and a history of the band, and it all comes at a good price. If you want to get into Bob Marley's amazing music, this is the perfect place to go. I can only wonder what it would have been like if Bob Marley were still alive today. Well anyway, this dual-disc collection is definitely hands-down worth the investment. Thanks for the time, and peace.

I remember walking by "Frailty" in the video rental store and was interested when I discovered Bill Paxton starred in this, as he rocked in "Near Dark". Anyway, a friend of mine recommended this to me (thanks again, Captain!), and I caught it about two weeks ago.Now, I probably should have reviewed this about two weeks ago, but this movie is so powerful, it's STILL fresh in my mind. If you don't know about the plot, it's about the "God's Hand Killer", a father of two played by Bill Paxton, and his two sons. The father gets a religious epiphany that God has chosen him to kill off "demons" living among humans in the world, so that the world will be a safer place. Whether or not they were real "demons" or just evil human beings, I can't quite recall. Either way, this movie is TWISTED!What makes this movie so great? Well, it's just incredibly well-written, lots of stunning twists in the plot that you couldn't see if you had the telescope at your local science hall. The acting is also superb. I must admit, I was a little doubtful when I saw big name actors like Paxton and Matthew McConaughey. Not entirely sure why I was doubtful, I just thought getting commercially successful actors in a horror film, a genre that isn't all that commercial (thank goodness!), wouldn't work.But, THIS MOVIE DOES WORK! It's an intelligent, gripping, psychotically limitless exploitation of a madman. It's almost like getting a first-hand view of what drives a murderer. Bone-chilling stuff, ain't it?The movie also has a Southern feel, since it is set in the South, and there's something about a Southern feel to movies that just appeals to me.Well, if you like psychological horror or are a fan of either Bill Paxton or Matthew McConaughey, this is a movie that will blow your mind! It's a deranged look at what drives a maniac, and it's very realistic, and incredibly-well portrayed, so this IS a horror movie ESSENTIAL. Plus, the DVD comes with lots of extra, including the trailer and some commentary by Bill Paxton, who also wrote and, I think, directed this movie (proving that in real life, Paxton IS NOT a maniac! HA HA!) Anyway, this is a very highly recommended, chilling piece of psychological horror, one of the best to come in the last, ten years. It's as good as "One Hour Photo", entirely different than it, but still just as good. Ahhh, "One Hour Photo", THAT'S a movie I might get to soon.Anyway, hit the lights, grab some snapple and get ready to get freaked out and amazed at the same time, because "Frailty" does just that! Thanks for the time, and peace.

The way I got into Dragonforce is a surely irregular one. I was up in Boston, at the Quincy Market, and this real nice girl was drawin' a caricature of me. I'm a guitarist, so naturally, she drew me playing the guitar. When she asked me what type of music I like, my response was pretty simple and honest: classic rock and heavy metal. She asked me if I had heard of Dragonforce. Though I didn't know any of their music, I HAD heard their name before, so I said yes. She then said she always laughs when she hears one of their songs. Feeling interested, I decided to check them out online. Listening to two of their song samples ("My Spirit Will Go On" and "Fury of the Storm"), I was two things:A: absolutely blown away by their speed, power and talentB: laughing because of their extreme speed (the artist in Boston was right)To any of you longtime Dragonforce fans, I apologize if my story sounds a little insulting or strange. Anyway, I went to the store one night and bought this. As I said in my title, there is probably no other album like "Sonic Firestorm". I've had this album for over a month, listened to the songs over and over and am STILL amazed at their smart and admirable combination of pure power and rich melodies. This album is pretty cheesy, but that's just something about it to love more. I can't stand bands today that think just because they sing fake-political songs that they think they're the greatest bands in the world, and don't even have the talent to back up what they say. Dragonforce, however, has plenty of talent, both lyrically and musically. Anyway, aside from their mastery of instrumentals, Dragonforce's mythical lyrics always fascinate me (I'd MUCH rather heard a song with medieval lyrics than any band that sings about being bored, etc. or whatever). I've noticed on a list of the top metal guitarists, Herman Li ranked at #81, and Sam at something like #90. That's extremely impressive considering Dragonforce has only had three albums out.Now, I'm gonna list my five favorite songs from the album and talk a little about them:5) "Dawn Over A New World": The fastest band in the world slows it down here and records a fantastic power ballad. The lyrics are very interesting, as always, and this is also one of their shortest songs.4) "Soldiers Of The Wasteland": An epic that's almost 10 minutes long! This is certainly one of their best songs in general, not just on this album, and it's one of their finest lyrical and musical performances. Their keyboardist, Vadim Pruzhanov, even gets to show a little of his chops! (On their most recent album, Inhuman Rampage, Dragonforce adds even more of Vadim's work on the keys, due to his growing influence on them). This is an extremely melodic song and something that you just gotta listen to!3) "My Spirit Will Go On": The opening song, and what a great way to start the album. The mystical riffs, followed by the banging, mechanical drums, go directly into the intense speed, and the instrumental is great. What's a standout of this is how in the middle of one of the solos, ZP Theart sings a melodic scale, which adds even more melody to this song.2) "Once In A Lifetime": It's not one of their most-known songs, but certainly one of their most beautiful, almost to an extent that it moves you. More great instrumentals, and ZP does the melodic scale thing on this one, too. This is the closing track and closes the album with a bang! Just look at the cheesy, yet wonderful and inspiring chorus: "Once in a lifetime, take a chance at the right time/ The glory you see/ Rise up for the time of your life/ Now the time has come for you to be free". Very excellent and melodic song, you gotta listen to this.And finally, my favorite song on the album...1) "Fury of the Storm": This seemed pretty obvious, huh? Well, it's certainly one of their best songs with an intensely melodic chorus and some of the best guitar work around. In the booklet, it shows who does the solos in the song, and in this song alone, there are ELEVEN solos! I love the whole song, but the choir-like verse after the long, long soloing and performing, following the final chorus, is great. In the chorus, a really catchy line is "For victory we ride...fury OF the storm...".Ever since I've had this album, I've ranked it among my favorite, which is saying something considering I have a large collection of albums. So, if you want something with wonderful lyrics, awesome instrumentals (especially the guitar work), but is overall melodic and cheesy, look no further than the mighty Dragonforce, and "Sonic Firestorm"! And remember...For victory we ride...fury OF the storm!

Considering I already reviews all four of the "Tremors" movies seperately, I'll keep this review short. The "Tremors Attack Pack" is the collection that I got the four movies from, and believe me, it's the best way to go. All four movies, plenty of extra features, packaging that isn't overly-bulky, and the price is great. If you're a fan of the "Tremors" series or want to get into a great monster-horror/comedy, this is the best way to do it! Very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

It's amazing how important classic rock 'n' roll renaissance and revival is becoming. Wolfmother's debut has been one of Amazon's best-selling items for quite some time now. Like others, yes, this is a recent CD, but, it's also the rock album that plays to the rhythm of a different drummer (no music pun intended). What I mean to say is, (and you've probably heard this a million times), Wolfmother sounds a lot like Zeppelin, Sabbath, and a dose of Purple. Of course, this album has something for everybody, almost track for track. "Dimension" is a mystical rocker that opens up with a shout from Andrew Stockdale. "White Unicorn" is a five-minute song that has an epic, progressive buildup. "Woman", the song that made me buy this CD, is a loud-as-ever, monster-riffed, drum-pounding headbanger anthem with a nice solo on the keys. "Apple Tree" is, as countless other reviewers have mentioned, somewhat White Stripes-esque, but the track is just a bit underrated. Give it a listen and decide for yourself. "Pyramid" has a big, rollicking bassline and a similar guitar riff. "Witchcraft" is slightly blues-based and a somewhat shorter track. "Love Train" is a funk-based, even soul-oriented song that's just great fun to listen to, and probably a delight at parties. The lyrics in "Vagabond" seem to be something like the lyrics of a Led Zep love song.So, don't be too doubtful when buying this, and don't listen to the negative reviews. Actually, people, let's get a larger amount of positive reviews here! I know, as well as we here all do, that they may seem too obvious when revealing their influences, their lyrics may not make as much sense to one as it may another, and they may not seem so original, but, it's all based on what you believe. Hey, when Black Sabbath released, "Paranoid", the critics hated them. And Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple may only be remembered for one or two songs (for Led Zeppelin: Stairway to Heaven, of course, well, basically anything from Zoso, for Deep Purple: Smoke on the Water, from "Machine Head").All I'm saying is: I was quite doubtful while buying this, but this album takes me somewhere otherworldly when I listen to it. And the first time, well...it was, to quote the title of one of their songs, a "Colossal" experience. But, to stop my beating around the bush, all I tell you is to give this album a chance. I did, and I can honestly say I'm very happy I did so.Hopefully, in 30 years, this will be considered a 21st century "Machine Head".

Over the years, Incubus has put out such classics as "S.C.I.E.N.C.E.", "Morning View", and this album, "Make Yourself". These albums have come to show us that not only is Incubus able to reach out to a large audience, but they are able to play the music they want to get that audience. Even while the band has several songs that have been Top 40 smashes, oddly enough, they've been playing the music that comes straight from their heart, playing sincere, real music that makes them happy, and also makes a huge amount of people around the world happy.You could say a lot of bands sound similar to Incubus, such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn and even Disturbed, but Incubus truly has a sound of their own, which they prove to you on "Make Yourself". And not only are Incubus able to create their own sound, but at the same time, they seem to master their own brand of music on this album. Here's a run-through of the standout tracks:"Priviledge": A funky, heavy guitar riff plays its way over a solid drumbeat throughout, and Brandon belts out his always great lyrics in his always great voice. This songs starts the album off on a very good note."Stellar": One of the biggest songs off the album, and one of Incubus's most well-known songs. Experimental turntable noises and Brandon's amazing voice start this song off before going into a beautiful, hypnotic guitar riff. The verses here are soft, spacy and very beautiful, and the chorus kicks it up a few notches with a hard-rock riff and more powerful vocals. Such great lyrics as "Meet me in outer space/ We could spend a night, watch the Earth come up", or "Meet me in outer space/ I will hold you close if you're afraid of heights", will make their way to countless teenager's Myspace and Facebook statuses."Make Yourself": The title track that definitely deserves to be given the name, "Make Yourself" combines more great guitar riffs, heavy drumbeats, nice melodies, great lyrics and a shout-a-long bridge into a classic, three-minute intelligent rocker."Drive": A sweet, acoustic guitar drives this song (no pun intended), and Brandon brings out some of his best lyrics and vocals around. The chorus is very catchy and hopeful, "Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there/ With open arms and open eyes, yeah/ Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there/ I'll be there". A very melodic, psychedelic guitar solo is also featured here, making this a great, laid-back song and a nice break into some softer stuff."Clean": Starting off with percussion and featuring some of the best turntable work on the entire album, this song definitely has a huge, seaside vibe to it. Another drive-by-the-beach classic."Battlestar Scralactica": A four-minute, instrumental track. This is probably the most experimental song on the whole album, and ensures for lots of listening fun with each turn of the band's progression."I Miss You": A beautiful ballad that seems perfect to slow dance to, with a melodic riff, romantic lyrics and probably Brandon's best vocal performance on the album. It's amazing that they could get all this down in not even three minutes, this is one of my favorite songs off the album."Pardon Me": Another huge hit off the album, with a faster vocal feel and some experimental vibes going on. Yet another great song!With such classic songs as these, "Make Yourself" is definitely one of the best rock albums of the past, ten years and is a great way for Incubus to close out the '90s. There are just so many great songs on here that are perfect for chilling, cruising or rocking out, it can fit whatever mood you're in. Plus, it along with other Incubus albums set the perfect summer mood. So be sure to get this album as soon as you can! Thanks for the time, and peace.

What would my 2nd "31 Reviews for 31 Days of Halloween" by without knocking back something as notorious and controversial as this film? Let's do it! Well, I'm not usually one that likes to follow or listen to hype. I generally take things in my own stride and if a movie or band or some form of art is up-to-par in my opinion with the rest of the hype, so be it. However, for the longest time I've been interested in checking out "Murder Set Pieces" to see if it really lives up to the shock value rumors and controversy it's accumulated. So, I finally checked it out, and here's both some facts and my opinion on this movie:Something that should be known right away, this movie is more than just an extreme splatterfest (although it does a darn good job at doing that!). This movie is a look into the mind of a murderer, a psychological exploitation of sorts that shows what fueled them to become this way. During quite a few parts, this movie is actually rather sad, showing how tortured and harped-on the murderer was. In a way, you feel bad for him seeing what a troubled and harsh past he had. This is similar to "Maniac", an equally as heavyhearted '80s goresoaked slasher film. So right off the bat, know that this isn't the sort of gorehound film to watch for kicks and entertainment; it actually gets quite emotional for something so visceral and shocking.Now on to the controversial matter: I don't usually like giving away spoilers to movies, but just to prove that this movie is as visceral as people say it is, I'll name off a few scenes that struck me. There's a scene where he drags a hooker kicking and screaming into a bathroom with a full bathtub, drenches her head beneath the water and slits her throat. A lot of throat-slitting deaths in films aren't super super graphic, but this one really breathed life into how vicious a throat-slitting scene could be; just see for yourself. I also don't think I have to say much about how he drives a huge chainsaw directly into a girl's skull... yep, there's buckets of red stuff there! Finally, a particularly disturbing clip is when he drops a girl's severed head from the seat of his truck to the ground and you can tell he was getting his rocks off with the girl's severed head's mouth... ew and a half right there!Now for my favorite part of the review: The ending. I always believe that endings can be make-it-or-break-it moments for horror films. So how does this one fare? Well to be honest, it goes down the route of "We're gonna make it look like there's gonna be a sequel but we're never gonna make it!", that so many horror films have been doomed to end as. I won't give it away but let's just say that since this is a one-off film, I wish they chose to end it a little differently.Overall, this is a must-view for fans of extreme horror. Though it isn't as sexually perverted as any of the movies in the "August Underground" trilogy, or even any of the classic foreign cannibal films from the '70s and '80s, this movie is one of the bloodiest, goriest, most violent films I've seen in some time. For fans of this brand of horror, definitely watch it! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Nowadays, there are so few real, quality horror films that get enough recognition. Sure, there are a good deal of great films that are under the radar of the mainstream, but when a really good horror movie of recent times comes around, it's definitely worth notice. And "Session 9" is worth the notice!Taking influence largely from "The Shining", in my opinion, "Session 9" is a psychological horror film with a great deal of intense and mysterious atmosphere that's laid on thicker than Thanksgiving gravy. The powerful sense of dread and chilling mystery presented throughout the film is simply enticing and definitely makes you want to see the whole thing. In addition to the asylum, which is one of the big reasons why the film is so great, this film delves pretty deeply into psychology with the recorded sessions of the asylum patients. This part definitely sucked me in, because psychology has always been a topic of great curiosity to me.Running at 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie is longer than most slashers and about as long as more psychological films. However, the length of the film doesn't drag it down or make it boring, because the movie is able to fill all 100 minutes with interest and mystery. Honestly, the asylum is one of the greatest locations I've seen in a while in horror films. The written part is also done excellently, showcasing a strong plot and chilling series of events. In addition, the acting is great, with the actors showing how truly talented they are, regardless of how much mainstream attention they get.Overall, with a dark and bleak feeling throughout, and a bitter ending, this is not a fun film by any means. However, "Session 9" is a film that will suck you into its mystery, depth, darkness and bleak appeal. If the feeling of this movie is too strong, I recommend washing it off with another great, modern-day horror film such as "Planet Terror" (even if it isn't 100% horror, it's great nonetheless). But as for this film, well, "Session 9" is the psychological horror film to beat of modern movies! Highly recommended for those interested in such a film, and to close, just because I love the quote so much, I need to say it again. "Where do you live?" --- "I live...in the weak...and the wounded!". Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives" brings back Jason after he was killed in the 4th movie, and a fake Jason took his place in the 5th (sorry for those who haven't seen the 5th! Watch it anyways, haha).Anyway, "Part 6" is one of my Top 3 favorites in the series, next to the original and the third installments. This one manages to blend gore, kills, great quotes, suspense and humor all in one. It's also got some really interesting stuff you wouldn't find in other Friday the 13th installments, such as:-Jason getting brought back to life by lightning.-A guy fighting Jason in a canoe surrounded by a ring of fire on a lake.-A random group of people playing paintball in the woods and all getting massacred while there still being funny moments to round it out.-And I think this one has the highest body count of all the Friday the 13th movies, with a total of 15 kills!Plus, a really interesting thing with this one is that part of it takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, and you actually get to see the camping kids, and how they become involved when the camp discovers Jason being loose. It's a cool twist that never made it into the first half of the Friday the 13th series.Well, I could keep going on how awesome this movie is, but I don't wanna give away everything. "Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives" is one of the very best installments in the Jason movie series, and is highly recommended for fans and non-fans.This is a really good horror movie that comes highly recommended, and is rewatchable, as are the rest of the Friday the 13th films! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Having heard about this movie on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments countdown, I felt obliged as a devoted horror fan to check this out. Based on the scenes shown in its time on the countdown, I expected this movie to be great, yet lacking in any real graphic nature....but WOW, why I quite wrong! Within the first 20 minutes of the movie, there's a full, on-screen orgy of fully-nude women, bloody self-mutilation and suicide. Remind me, this movie came out a little over 30 years ago? Intensity at it's finest!So we're off to an extreme and awesome start, and then the movie, interestingly enough, makes a turn into a slower-paced, more gothic route. A model moves into a large apartment building in the city, and as the movie progresses, creepier and creepier things start to happen. This makes for an interesting contrast to the intro, and the gothic elements of the movie are really well-done. Don't worry though, for those seeking more of the glorious graphic nature of the first part of the movie, it picks right back up towards the end! A brutal climax is assured, combining both gruesome imagery and captivating, mysterious atmosphere.The movie ends on a somewhat unusual note, although for movies of the time it's really not that odd. Although the DVD could have been stronger in the extra features department, the movie itself is great. Overall, "The Sentinel" is a highly recommended horror movie for fans seeking a well-done combination of the more graphic side of horror and the more supernatural, atmospheric side. Thanks for the time, and peace.

In my opinion, only a handful of bands in history deserve a compilation that includes the words, "The Very Best of" in their title (to this day it is overused), but ignoring that fact, the Grateful Dead are certainly one of them. Here you get seventeen tracks, filling up almost 80 minutes of their music. When I first got this a couple of summers ago, I gave it a good listen and loved it.Pros:A lot of good things can be said about this CD. The music, compilation itself, artwork, photos, liner notes, etc. are all very well done. It even gives you a discography and complete list of band members! Talk about a good way to keep yourself busy for a while. They also give you an order form for Dead merchandise.Cons:In terms of the music, none, but then again, no complaints in general. Deadheads could probably think of a couple of tracks to add here (Dark Star, Wharf Rat) but if that was the case, this would have to lead to be a dual-disc compilation. Still, as a single-disc, this is near-perfect.Standout/ Favorite Tracks Of Mine:"Truckin'": Fantastic Dead track, filled with great music and lyrics, of course, one of the famous "American Beauty" tracks. What's ironic about this song is that while it's the opener here, it's the closing song on "AB", or so I believe."Touch of Grey": From one of their last albums, In The Dark (1987). Catchy, with a landscape of instruments and very psychedelic lyrics. That may not come to a surprise, considering ITD was released after Jerry Garcia was in the hospital, in a coma (which possibly explains the album title/cover)"Sugar Magnolia": It's too bad I never listen to this song much, anymore, because it's great. Seems to be a laid-back free man's love song with some very contrasting yet awesome lyrics, one of the Dead's shortest songs here, too, at 3:17."Casey Jones": From "Workingman's Dead". Great track, of course. I love the buildup of the instruments when the chorus is repeated four times out in the end. The lyrics here are certainly those that speak for the Dead's lifestyle and way of adventure. "Drivin' that train/ High on cocaine/ Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed/ Trouble ahead, trouble behind/ And you know that notion just crossed my mind"."Uncle John's Band: A mellow, acoustic song apparently about being in a band with an almost father-like uncle. A very memorable song."Friend of the Devil": Another really good song, but the combination of acoustic guitar/thumping bass is a strange combo. The lyrics are quite diverse and seem to be the narration of the life of a "friend of the devil"."Franklin's Tower": I love how the chorus just repeats "Roll away...the dew" and the whole song has a nice feel to it."Estimated Prophet": An eclectic pop song. The wa-wa guitar riff is very jolly and the type of melody that you'd whistle while walking down the street. However, the lyrics are very different for a Dead song. When you look beyond the "California... preaching on the burning shore" and "Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine" this song is very dark, especially the first verse: "My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no." At any rate, it's still an excellent song."Eyes of the World": All right! Now HERE'S a song I can talk about. This is a great summer song, it features wonderful jams, mystical lyrics and is overall unforgettable. Reminds me of a place that seems unfamiliar to anywhere else I've been to. I don't even know where it is, but it's beautiful. Actually, it also reminds me of a playground I used to go to long ago. This song brings up great memories and fantasies, and on top of it all, has a great riff in between lines, along with some great bass-guitar work towards the end."The Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion": A huge standout, barely over two minutes. This was from their debut album, featuring experimental, acid-like ditties, zippy tempos and covers of old jazz and blues tunes done really well. Anyway, this song, their first recorded, is a classic, and is overall very good."One More Saturday Night": A live performance from "Euorpe 72" with great guitar and piano work, and a psychedelic version of that cliched 50's rhythm. Great live anthem."The Music Never Stopped": Not weird, but certainly different from alot of other songs. Another great summer track, a jazzy anthem featuring a sax and Donna Godchaux singing a few lines. This is the only song on this compilation to have so on it."Hell in a Bucket": A bit of a more uptempo song and a slightly heavier beat. I really like this song all-around and the lyrics, like "Touch of Grey" suit the "In The Dark" album."Ripple": Here's a song I hear plenty of talk from. Deadheads would often say it just isn't the same without leading into "Brokedown Palace", but the single version is also excellent in my opinion. A sensetive, folky, acoustic song with very reflective lyrics. This is a type of song that should typically close out any album (a song that's deep and gentler, even if the whole album is zippy and wild).Overall:So, as I finalize this review, I know I may have rambled on (in text) to you about these songs, but it may as well be worth it. The Grateful Dead have left a legacy behind, and Jerry Garcia (along with original keyboardist Ron "Pigpen" McKernan) have left us much too soon. Not wanting to lean onto that topic too much, I just want to finish up by saying that this is a great compilation for - A: Grateful Dead music B: A venture into new territories (if you're new to the Dead and/or psychedelic rock in general, of which the Grateful Dead is one of the greatest bands) and C: A great summer soundtrack. So what are you waiting for? Getting this album is totally worth it, in fact, I wish I could be able to listen to the Grateful Dead for the very first time again. It was something I know I'll never forget.

Today's offering of horror films has been known to be very hit-or-miss. Some 2000's horror films are great, other make you want to claw your own eyes out. Fortunately, in a time of such extremes, "Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet" takes us back to the golden era of horror films with a modern-day intensity to make for a movie that truly impressed me.This movie goes for the throat straight from the getgo, with bloodsoaked mutilation, great eerie and atmospheric location, graphic nudity and a disturbing rape scene within the first 15 minutes. The film then goes into classic teenage debauchery in a suburban area, and it's done in such a classic manner. The whole film rolls really smoothly with a nice blend of full-on gore, sexual indulgence and ironic humor. Then of course, let's not forget that we have horror heavyweights Danielle Harris and Bill Moseley thrown in.Overall, I thought this was a great horror film that's definitely more than just a one-time watch. The only thing I'd complain about is how they chose to end it, but a lot of horror films end in a similar manner so that's sort of a dead issue. Either way, for a highly entertaining slasher film packed with sex and gore, this will be one wild ride! Thanks for the time and peace.

Picking up exactly where the first film ended (something I'd like to see more in horror films!), Hatchet 2 grabs you by the throat right from the start. Featuring horror legends Tony Todd and Danielle Harris, this film is, like the first film, a reminder of the classic '80s slasher affair. Combine inappropriately random and altogether humorous (sometimes awkwardly, but in a good way) dialogue, full-on gore screaming in your face, and the bayou setting for great atmosphere thrown in for good measure, and you got yourselves a great sequel. Though a bit by-the-numbers, I think Hatchet 2 was a very entertaining slasher film and a great throwback to the classics. If you saw the first one, you should definitely see this one, if only for the fact that you find out what happens to Danielle Harris's character. If this movie sounds enticing, be sure to check out the first one and then catch this for back-to-back madness! Again, this film is essentially more of the same stuff from the first one, but at the same time it's done in a way that gets you hooked, much like the Friday the 13th series. If you're interested in a bloodsoaked, entertaining Friday night slasher film, be sure to check this out! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Bathory's debut album is the epitome of the first wave of black metal, with its sinister riffs, fast and raw drumbeats, eerie lyrics and evil vocals. In the 23 minutes of playtime this album has, it proves its one of the best early black metal albums. There are plenty of awesome riffs, frantic solos, demonic vocals and a dark atmosphere to boot! Highly recommended to all fans and newcomers of black metal, because this is not only the definition of true black metal, but practically the birth of it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

This album has everything a great album in this vein of metal should have; it's a nice long dose of loud, hard, fast energy. The heavy guitar riffs can be both complex and catchy at the same time, and don't even get me started on how crazy The Rev is on his drum kit! Some of his playing on this album rivals even the mighty Brann Dailor of Mastodon! *gasp* I personally consider Brann Dailor the best new metal drummer of this decade, so I'm giving The Rev a big compliment. Anyway, back to the album...Now before getting this album, there is something all readers should know. As great an album as it is, it does lack the blazing, incredible guitar solos of something such as "City of Evil". There are two solos on the album, though, a powerful, majestic solo on the intro "To End The Rapture" and a beautiful and passionate solo during "Warmness on the Soul". However, don't let the lack of Synyster's wild shredding turn you off to this album, it's an underrated gem.Most of the songs are mid- to fast-paced and are consistent throughout. However, the band does have the class to write the song "Warmness on the Soul" which is by far one of the best and most beautiful ballads I've heard in a long, long time. I wouldn't be surprised to hear it be a few people's wedding songs! But the rest of the album is indeed heavily influenced by European metal, with both the riffs and M. Shadow's amazing, hardcore voice.While you won't find as much of M. Shadows's clean singing or Synyster Gates ripping out his blazing solos, this high-energy album is one for the books. At first I didn't think much of it, but after a while I relistened to it and realized what a metal gem this is. Don't miss your opportunity to get into this beast, go to the store and get this now! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Having heard about this movie, I decided to check it out and was fortunate to find it in separate pieces on Youtube. "Bad Ronald" is certainly an interesting watch and one of the horror films that made the diversity of '70s horror what it is. If you don't know about the plot, it's about a guy named Ronald who just celebrated his birthday (18th I think) and accidentally killed a neighbor girl. To keep him safe from the police, whom she doesn't think will believe that it was an accident, Ronald's mom hides him in the walls of their house, and that's where he stays throughout the film. The movie is well-balanced between what happens in the house in general, and Ronald's perspective of being stuck in the hideaway shelter he's in. This gave the movie a lot of its charm, it's got the sort of exciting, claustrophobic element that you get when you're a kid going about your tomfoolery and hiding from something in your imagination. It was suspenseful, and quite charming in its combination of suspense and youthful fun. For a '70s horror film, it really isn't that extreme in any manner, but what it lacks for in Italian cannibal exploitation or schizophrenic men in masks with giant power tools, it makes up for in all the great qualities I previously mentioned. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"Island Claws" is an obscure sleeper of a film from the animal-horror boom that gave us "Grizzly" and the "Jaws" series. Basically it's a sci-fi flick about crabs on an island community that run amok. There are some good action scenes and the character development aspect of the storyline is well-done, but the pacing of the movie is really where it suffers. Overall, entertaining for a watch if you've got some free time. I'd imagine that this movie is very hard to find, but it is up in its entirety on Youtube, which is where I came across it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

Being an Opeth fan for some time now and owning almost all of their studio albums, I think that "Blackwater Park" may be their overall best, even if it isn't my overall favorite. The first thing you'd probably think after reading that is, "What makes this Opeth's best album?". And my answer would be this:"Blackwater Park" is probably Opeth's overall best album because it captures their songwriting at its best. Opeth writes each of the eight songs by going by what makes musical sense. The songs are more concise, with the sections being less drawn-out. This shows that Opeth was focused more on the content of the song, and not just writing a 10-minute song for the sake of writing a 10-minutes song (even though three of the eight songs are over 10 minutes, but regardless...).Keep in mind though, I am NOT trashing Opeth as songwriters. I think they make some of the most exciting and interesting metal of their peers. However, on other albums some songs, as great as they may be, may have had passages that went on for a little too long, were a little too drawn out. I think here, Opeth's songwriting skills are at their peak: Each one of the songs is interesting and well-done, and there wasn't a second when I thought it was too drawn-out.Of course, Opeth has also always been a band that is packed with musical talent. Mikael Akerfeldt, alongside being a skilled guitarist, is, in my opinion, the greatest death metal vocalist today. His growls are so powerful and gigantic, it's as if his vocals came from demons. HOWEVER! Mikael is also the possessor of a beautiful clean voice; when he sings cleanly over gentle, acoustic passages, shivers run down my spine. It's hard to believe somebody could be amazing at both demonic death growls and beautiful clean singing. The rest of the band is great, too, being on top of every change in each song and doing so with gusto.From the brutal and intense heavy parts to the mystical and beautiful soft parts, this album just works. It's amazing to think that such a work of musical art comes from a band that can be considered death metal, but that's part of what's so great. Such a landmark metal album comes highly recommended to both death metal fans and non-death metal fans. For something that combines beauty with brutality, "Blackwater Park" is a high-water mark in an amazing band's history. Thanks for the time, and peace.

It's interesting to think how "Duel" is the film that broke Steven Spielberg through and helped make him the household name he is today. "Duel" is a highly entertaining and suspenseful movie, and one thing that makes this movie so great is how minimalistic the whole thing is! Think about it; how many movies can you name where the whole film is basically one giant chase scene? Any movie that can pull such a feat off and be interesting all the way through is a surefire winner in my book, and "Duel", being such a movie, earns a spot amongst other classic horror/suspense movie that I've seen.With so little to work with, it makes it that much easier to add detail to everything. Details that were worked to perfect include that of the truck: If you look, it has a railroad track with a bunch of license plates on it...hhmm, a giant truck with the license plates of other cars on its front. Yep, we have a serial killer on the loose! Speaking of which, I also find it curiously interesting that they never show the face of the truck driver, which highlights that the scariest thing about evil is the unknown factor behind it.Overall, "Duel" is a feat that probably couldn't be pulled off by just any writer and still be as good as it is. "Duel" is a movie that will have you on the edge of your seat almost from the start, and all the way through to its heart-pumping, and satisfying, conclusion! Thanks for the time, and peace.

What can I say about this DVD that hasn't already been said? It's Led Zeppelin, live, loud and all-powerful, rocking us at the high level only they reached. The songs are all top notch, the performances are insane, and there's hours of footage that will never stop blowing your mind!I already knew that Led Zeppelin where masters at what they do, but this practically redefined their level of excellency for me! Hammer of the gods, indeed! When you hear the bludgeoning opening riff to "Immgrant Song", it's more like a giant, plugged-in sledgehammer!From their pounding, electric anthems to their amazing, mellower pieces, this DVD has it all, and shows Led Zeppelin performing at the top of their game, proving that whatever they do, they do it great. It shows their wide variety of styles that they blend together to make their own sound, and this DVD is a testament to one of rock's all-time greatest bands in their prime.Hope you all have lots of fun with this one! "Led Zeppelin" is one that will never get old, and I'd even say it beats out "The Song Remains The Same". So if you liked that one, watch out, because this one will rock you again! Long live the mighty rock leviathan that is Led Zeppelin! Thanks for the time, and peace.

With the dawn of the '90s comes Judas Priest's "Painkiller", possibly the greatest and one of the most influential speed metal albums of all time. Between Rob's always-impressive range of vocals shattering the air, KK and Glenn's jaw-dropping guitar work and newcomer Scott Travis's complex, thundering drumming, this album is one of the absolute finest releases by the Metal Gods.There's no doubt when it comes to the fact that Judas Priest has experimented a bit over the years. Their earlier works were bluesier and more progressive, their '80s classics delved in New Wave of British Heavy Metal. In terms of the sound on this album, if compared to other artists, it's kind of like taking the thick, rich epic guitar-and-drum tone of Mercyful Fate, mixed with the speed and sinister riffage of Slayer and the melody and talent of Van Halen, only faster, heavier and a more epic sense of melody. However, that's only comparing them to other artists, I feel that "Painkiller" has a sound that totally original Judas Priest. And "Painkiller" is the Holy Grail of adrenaline-driven metal of the past 20 years. It's the high-water mark probably most metal bands today aim at. And you've got to be honest and say that all these songs, as fast and wild as they are, still are very well written.One great thing about the album is that it's a concept album. The Painkiller is the hero, and the Nightcrawler is the villain, and most of the album between those two songs is about triumph in battle, and the evils that lurk in the night. Yes, this is indeed Priest at their finest.Another thing that makes this album more interesting is the order of the songs. I mean, sure, they've gotta be in a certain order to make a sensible concept, but I love how the songs go from tense to comfort, and back and forth. The dynamics of the album are just as impressive as the musicianship, songwriting and singing.Some of my favorite songs on this metal classic are:"Painkiller": The six-minute epic that opens the album, kicking the song off with some blast beat drumming and a heavy, sinister guitar riff. Lots of blazing, power-packed guitar soloing fill out this album, with Rob screeching all the way through with his signature power."Hell Patrol": A nice contrast of "Painkiller", like I was talking about. It rocks just as hard but it's got more of a comfort level than a tension like "Painkiller". More great riffs, and Rob uses his cool mid-range voice for this song."Metal Meltdown" opens with 30 seconds of pure guitar shredding, a great way to open the album. In comes a fast, melodic but sinister riff and lightning drums, and Rob using his powerful voice as always."Nightcrawler": The headbanger of a song that's about the villain in the concept album. Features a creepy and tense, quiet section where Rob sings about the Nightcrawler being like a villain in a slasher film. Very interesting song."A Touch of Evil": An epic song at over five and a half minutes, combining awesome keyboards, guitar work and lyrics. One of the best metal songs ever, indeed."One Shot At Glory": Is the lengthy, epic anthem that closes out the original album with a bang!In addition, the album comes with the moody "Living Bad Dreams" and a live version of "Leather Rebel". So to sum myself up, "Painkiller" is one of the best speed metal/ power metal albums ever to be released. I strongly recommend this to all Judas Priest fans, and all metal and rock fans, because it's an amazing, well-written classic. Thanks for the time, and peace.
