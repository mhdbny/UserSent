Grand Illusion is the 7th album by Swedish melodic metal band "Nocturnal Rites" originally released in 2005. This album was my introduction to the band and their sound. As with most Scandinavian bands of this genre, `Nocturnal Rites' benefit from incredible album production that further elevates the compositions and performances on `Grand Illusion'. Undeniably the album's main advantages are the collection of huge choruses and the consistency of musical direction throughout the track list. The sound of "Nocturnal Rites" is built on thick rhythm guitar, shredding solos, robust rhythm section with regular double bass attack, while the keyboards are carrying the majority of instrumental melodic lines of the album. Yet, above all, it is the vocal performance that ultimately gives the album its character-making it distinct and memorable;For that matter it mainly comes down to the incredible abilities of lead singer Jonny Lindqvist who proves himself capable of carrying any melodic line (no matter how long or short) while communicating it to the listener in the most passionate and intense way. The line up also features rhythm guitarist Fredrik Mannberg, lead guitarist Nils Norberg, bassist Nils Eriksson and drummer Owe Lingvall.Having lived with the album a couple of years, one happily reaches the conclusion that the material on "Grand Illusion" is qualified to stand the test of time. It simply goes back to the choruses: even after having played the album to your content, choruses tend to storm the listener's mind time and time again drawing you once again to the album. For that matter, I just came home today humming the chorus of "End of a rope" which led me to playing the album again after almost a year, subsequently writing this review. Other very memorable moents include "Fools never die", "Never trust", "Something undefined" and "Never ending". If you enjoy hugely produced melodic metal in the style of "Leverage", then "Nocturnal Rites- Grand Illusion" is an ideal purchase.

This is the debut album by American melodic hard rock/AOR band "House of Lords" originally released in 1989. "House of Lords", arguably the archetypal AOR super-group of the lat e 80s, were actually a re-formed version of the band "Giuffria". Under Gene Simmon's management, AOR hero Greg Giuffria reunited with former "Giuffira" members guitarist Lanny Cordola and bassist Chuck Wright (who played on the debut album). The line up also featured "Fifth Angel"/Alice Cooper drummer Ken Mary and last but not least, singer James Christian who would led the band through the decades."House of Lords" arguably set to combine the most appealing elements of 80s rock drawing from such subgenres as melodic hard rock, AOR and glam metal. Perhaps the album's greatest achievement comes down to the fact that all musicians are given room to shine on "House of Lords" each of the five a protagonist in their own right.Songs commonly open on Giuffria's imaginative keyboard harmonies which also kick in during the choruses. Lanny's guitar is just as much in the spotlight delivering thick opening riffs and flamboyant melodic shredding. Ken Mary's drum attack is up front in the mix while the stickman holds nothing back delivering big toms and the occasional double bass attack. The latter is perfectly complemented by Wright's bass lines handling everything from pomp AOR, to hair metal to melodic hard rock, delivering the appropriate tone on each occasion. Finally there is Chrisitan's monumental performance making instant classics out of "Pleasure Palace" , "Edge of your life", "Hearts of the world" and "I wanna be loved"."House of lords" would go through various line-up changes in the following years, break up and re-form with only consistency provided by James Christian who went on to lead the group in the new millennium effectively releasing a string of superior melodic hard rock albums. Still the "House of Lords" debut still stands as the very definition of a super-group at work!

Though mostly known for their latest achievement "Allegiance", this very first Firewind album competes closely with the previously mentioned release in terms of quality. "Between Heaven and Hell" is an impeccable album yet very different from Allegiance. This early line- up is put together by Greek metalheads Gus G. (guitars) and Constantine (bass) who join forces with American power metalers Stephen Frederick (vocals) and Brian Harris (Drums).The composing chemistry of Gus and Stephen is solid and colorful, coming up with inspired riffs, melodic solos and incredibly catchy choruses. In terms of technique things do not get much better than this: Heavy guitar riffs, perfectly phrased solos, precise use of double bass beat drums, without overdoing it, and the unforgettable voice of Frederick separate this album from the bulk of power/epic metal albums of 2002. Finally the production of this work is scholastic and very well balanced.A fact that will very likely amuse or surprise you is that this line up never met or played live together. Vocals and Drums were recorded in Atlanta USA, while guitars and bass in Greece.Firewind's new album Allegiance and its seminal singles are charting considerably throughout Europe. When "Between Heaven and Hell" was released the vast majority ignored Firewind's existence; in some European countries it sold less than 100 copies.

"Run for cover" is Gary Moore's fifth solo album in the 80s rock genre originally released in 1985 featuring some of his greatest hits in the decade. Being accustomed to session musicians, Moore utilizes an extensive lists of players on "Run for cover"; having said that "Run for cover" demonstrates a solid creative core which is Gary joined by two legends of rock, Glen Hughes ("Deep Purple", "Black Sabbath") and Phil Lynott ("Thin Lizzy").Glenn Hughes plays bass and sings on "Reach for the sky", "Out of my system", "All messed up" and "nothing to loose" being the more uplifting, glamorous and popular side of the album. Phil Lynott, on the other hand, performs lead vocals and bass on "Military man", a song he had intentionally written for his own project as well as sharing a vocal duet with Gary on "Out in the fields" which turned out to be Moore's biggest European hit single to that point. Both songs represent the album's more aggressive side with strong ties to the previous album "Victims of the future". Moore, for his part sings lead on "Listen to your heart beat" and "Empty Rooms" the album's ballads with the latter standing as the record's second hit single. As before Gary's guitar work is extraordinary delivering the appropriate tone (melody-wise) for each and every tune on "Run for cover".Overall "Run for cover" was another step up the ladder to hard rock stardom while baring the same high quality standards as any of Gary's previous albums in hard rock. "Run for cover" also balances ideally the two sides of Gary's song-writing the catchy/party hard rock and the protestant-impact driven- metal.

Having shelved what was going to be his second* solo album planned for a 1981 release, Gary Moore under a new label started working on "Corridors of power" which hit the stores in 1982. "Corridors of power" would prove the first hit album for the guitarist in the `80s regarding the UK market. The line up on this album features drum legend Ian Paice, bassist Neil Murray, and Tommy Eyre on keyboards while Moore handles lead vocals and all guitars.In comparison to its predecessor "G-Force", "Corridors..." finds Moore's band rocking in a much rougher style and sound. The songs are developed rough around the edges and considerably unpolished; having said that, the song-writing at parts is meant to produce radio friendly slower tunes like the AOR-ish "Always gonna love you", the ballad "Falling in love with you" and the atmospheric "I can't wait until tomorrow".Never the less, it seems that the heavier songs of "Corridors of power" turned out to be the most memorable, namely the mega dramatic "End of the world" (featuring the great Jack Bruce on lead vocals) the unsurpassable "Don't take me for a looser" the darkly melodic "End of the world" and yet another testament in wild rock partying which is "Rockin' every night". Overall "Corridors of Power" was the album that introduced Gary Moore as a solo artist internationally while also establishing him in the United Kingdom and Japan-a classic 80s hard rock album.*Counting from 1980 onwards, his second solo album in the style of `80s rock.

"Legendary tales" is the debut album of Italian power/neoclassical metal heroes "Rhapsody" (later known as "Rhapsody of fire") originally released in 1997. "Legendary tales" is broadly considered to be amongst the works/albums that re-elevated the status of power metal in the late 90s establishing "Rhapsody" as the premiere Italian band of the genre. The line up features guitarist Luca Turilli, key-player Alex Staropoli, drummer Daniele Carbonera and lead singer Fabio Lione.Despite being a debut effort, "Legendary Tales" is an incredibly accomplished musical production, going way beyond the technical abilities of the band members; the album features a ten-piece choir and a four-piece sting section being a key part on each and every composition on the album while having Sasha Paeth as the production engineer guarantees excellent audio quality even by today's standards. Add to the above the musical abilities of each individual band member with particular focus on Luca, Alex and Fabio (who have been widely appraised by fans and critics alike) and you have a release that effectively raised the bar for power metal.A cynical look at the release would point out that the neoclassical shredding, the keyboard scales, the speeding drums and the orchestral arrangements had been done before; still "Rhapsody" brought it all together in a large, flamboyant but substantial manner. Indeed "legendary tales" serves as the earliest example of how to integrate neoclassical and symphonic elements into power metal.

Re-issued by "Metal Mind Productions" in 2009 is the third studio album by Swedish melodic/neoclassical hard rock band "Silver Mountain", originally released in 1988. "Silver Mountain" could be considered as pioneers of the Swedish hard rock/metal scene having debuted in the early 80s and have featured such talents as Jens Johannson and Anders Johansson (Both ex-YJM "Rising Force") and at some point during their earlier steps Malmsteen himself is said to have briefly joined the ranks.Though mostly remebered for neoclassical metal, "Roses and Champagne", their final studio offering was fairly in synch with the time it was released-late `80s. So you can expect a more polished production, a more refined rhythm section, emphasis on melodic guitar lines (plus some very effective guitar riffs) all complemented by a fair amount of keyboard harmonies, reinforcing the melodic rock aspects of the album. The line up features lead singer Johan Dahlstrom, guitarist Jonas Hansson, bassist Per Stadin, drummer Kjell Gustavsson and keyboardist Erik Bjorn Nielsen.Though at times one might get the impression that "Siver Mountain" are struggling a bit to induce the trades of neoclassical metal into their melodic hard rock, the end result is fairly interesting with a good amount of standout songs like the opener "Romeo & Juliet", "Light the light" and "Paradise Smile". No question, there is also a fair amount of nostalgia that will be triggered once you play this one, regardless of whether you have heard "Roses and Champagne" in the past, it really bring that late-80s glamorous-melodic vibe to life. If you are a fan of late-80s melodic hard rock with a neoclassical touch, you will make the most of "Silver Mountair-Roses & Champagne".

"Domino Effect" is the 8th studio album by Swiss hard rock band "Gotthard" originally released in 2007. "Gotthard" are identified as the premiere hard rock group of Switzerland with consistent success in their home country.In retrospect "Domino Effect" would easily be considered amongst the best ever studio efforts of "Gotthard" as well as being the lengthiest with a total of fifteen songs on offer. The line up is as unchanged as ever featuring lead singer Steve Lee, guitarists Leo Leoni and Freddy Scherer, bassist Marc Lynn and drummer Henna Habegger.Upon first play one immediately identifies that Lee is indeed at the top of his vocal game, possibly his best every performance bringing out both melody and attack with a style similar to Tommy Heart and David Coverdale; Undeniably Lee is the star/protagonist of the band, while the other members lay the foundation for some of the greatest songs in `Gotthard"s career. The songwriting is to the point and totally infectious with performance following in the same fashion being heavy and melodic still avoiding over-layering the compositions. So at basis you get a classic sounding riff, a twin guitar melody, solid rhythm section and a memorable chorus; this is the recipe of "Domino effect" and should work ideally for any fan of hard rock, melodic rock and AOR.Favorite tracks include "Domino effect", "The oscar goes to", "Gone too far" and "Master of Illusion". Conclusively while "Domino effect" finds instant appeal on any hard rock fan, it does have the musical depth and length to draw the listener to it time and time again.

"The duke" is the 4th solo album by rock/metal singer Jorn Lande originally released in 2006. On "The duke", Jorn puts together a monster line up featuring guitarist Viggo Lofstad who recorded the previous album `Out to every nation' along with Tore Moren who played guitar on the second album "Worldchanger"; the line up also features classic "TNT" bassist Morty Black, a veteran of the Norwegian rock scene and drummer Willy Bendiksen.It has to be addressed that "The duke" was the first Jorn album to feature the two guitar formation which would since become a trademark of the band's sound. And the selection of musicians is a real plus for the album as "The duke" is the perfect balance of Jorn's metal side and pomp melodic rock side. On this fourth album the iconic Norwegian singer establishes his personal musical style which is indeed a mixture of the previous three albums. "The duke" features heavy riffs and grooves but also a plethora of melodies and while compositions may sound thick and aggressive, they do conclude on huge/catchy choruses.In retrospect, I would say that "The duke" is the album to feature the most memorable songs on Jorn's catalogue. One literally does not need a second play of the album to recall the choruses of "Duke of love", "We brought the angels down" and "Blacksong". In addition the cover version of `Thin lizzy's "Are you ready" is a definite plus for the album, as Jorn and co deliver a killer version of another rock classic. Finally there is the reworked version of "Starfire", the title track of the singer's debut that is also granted a second life on `The duke'.Overall I do consider `The duke' as the most complete "Jorn" album to date, combining ideally the singer's influences and previous music styles into an album that lacks absolutely nothing. Heavy, groovy, melodic, dramatic and erotic are all qualities to be found on `The duke".

"Kiuas" is a progressive power metal band from Finland and "Reformation" is their second album originally released in 2006. I got this album in 2008 when "Kiuas" were special guests on the European shows of "Firewind". For that matter "Kiuas" sounds very different than the previously mentioned band, due to their progressive element. This progression can be traced on unconventional rhythm patterns and very peculiar melodic lines; however "Reformation" is by no means a difficult listener (for a progressive release).This is mainly because "Kiuas" song writing is well planned and disciplined: Each song has intro riff(s), mid section, bridge and chorus - these areas are well defined and even the least experienced listeners will be able to find their way through the musical passages of the song on offer. Credit has to be given to the guys for not overcompensating on the song structure instead they understand the importance of having direct metal songs with really big choruses. And I would like to insist on the aspect of directness; despite the progressive labelling, the song themes create quite vivid pictures in one's mind; for example on "Through the ice age" and "The new chapter" you actually feel the guys moving through frozen landscapes with determination as their only guide.Most songs on offer here are very relevant and another advantage of "Reformation" is that it is not an incredibly fast paced album, suggesting that it gives you time to appreciate all the progressive twists and turns on songs plus some really technical lead guitar work. I would recommend this "Kiuas" album to any fan of power metal who demands music to be progressive and catchy at the same time. "Reformation" is a very well balanced prog metal release.

"Conquer and divide" is the 4th studio album by US neoclassical metal outfit "The reign of terror", originally released in 2003. The band led by American guitar shredder-virtuoso Joe Stump featured renowned lead singer Michael Vescera (ex-Malmsteen, "Obsession"), bassist Jay Rigney and drummer Matt Scurfield."The Reign of Terror" play neoclassical metal similar to the styles of "YJM Rising Force" and "Impellitteri", belonging in a genre with well defined musical still "Conquer and divide" manages to bring new elements to the table, particularly in terms of guitar playing.Indeed, Joe's guitar playing is the very definition of neoclassical shredding, yet he manages to come up with rather inventive solo patents and lead themes that are original though reminiscent of other guitarists of the genre. Aside of that, most of the guitar riffs are fairly similar to the works of bands mentioned above, yet that is to expected for a band of this genre.A more significant differentiating factor of "Conquer and Divide" is the darker lyrical and musical concept that is directly hinted on the front cover. Indeed, its rather uncommon for neoclassical metal bands to sound as evil as "The reign of terror"; for that matter "Mark of the devil", "Sign of the Cross", "Forsaken" and "Sacrifice" are prime examples of the musical approach described above.I have to conclude that the "The reign of terror" flows naturally, being technical without getting repetitive-definitely keeping the listener engaged to most of its songs. For fans of neoclassical metal, "The reign of terror" will probably prove an interesting, if not thrilling, musical experience.

Although it has been over a year since I bought the album I hesitated to review it simply because it is so amazing that I still don't think I can put that accurately on description.The brother of German guitar legend Uli Jon Roth, guitarist Zeno Roth made his solo recording debut in 1986 while in the process discovered, utilized and promoted the talents of such musicians as Ule W. Ritgen (Fair Warning) andTommy Heart (Fair Warning , Soul Doctor)"Listen to the light", originally released in 1998, is probably the best ever melodic hard rock album. The divine guitar melodies of Zeno unite perfectly with the orchestral arrangements while the sublime vocal performances support the intensity of the overall performance and put out some of the most forceful choruses in the history of Hard rock. All 15 songs are so well thought, planned and executed that make "Listen to the Light" sound like the ultimate hard rock musical; still it is far more passionate powerful and real that you can not help but be blown away.After playing the album a few dozen times it became clear that all this musical majesty is orchestrated by the command of Zeno's guitar which lays impossibly colorful melodies and blinding solos. The man is clearly nothing less than a musical genius whose passion and commitment to this music is unquestioned. What he has created here in terms of orchestration, composition and performance is beyond words. Zeno combines the musical colors with such majesty that "Listen to the Light" shifts effortlessly from aggressive to melancholic from lightning fast to mystical slow.Zeno opens the door to a whole new galaxy of hard rock.Taking the objective as possible approach I can not say that there are many songs that can stand toe to toe with "Eden on Fire", "Meet me at the rainbow", "Love in your eyes" and "Tomorrow Arise", naming just a few of the fascinating tracks on this superior release.If you want to make an experience out of your next CD purchase, buy this and prepare to be `awesomized'. If you are a fan of "Fair Warning" or Uli Jon Roth you absolutely have got to get this.

Although officially his third solo album, "G-Force" was the first attempt of the great Gary Moore at 80s rock, (the genre that would later stand for AOR, melodic hard rock and hair metal). What nowadays regarded as another solo effort by Moore, "G-Force" was actually indented to be the band name upon which the Irish guitar legend would stage his career."G-Force" could as well mark Moore's first attempt at establishing himself in the North American market; "G-force" for that matter was formed in late 1979 at Los Angeles and featured bassist Tony Newton, key-player Willie-Dee and drummer Mark Naauseef along side Gary who handles all guitars and vocals. The sound of "G-Force" was built on inventive but catchy guitar riffs, rather straightforward song structures, and undeniably the largest choruses Moore had written to that point. It would be safe to claim that the songwriting and production of "G-Force" was ahead of its time. The guitar takes a protagonist role, bringing to front techniques (particularly shredding) that would become a trademark of 80s rock; in addition the guitar production sounds totally unique, in an over-polished, but overly powerful sound.Songs like "She's got you" and "You", are chilling dramatic hard rockers, while "You kiss me sweetly" and "Because of your love" are powerful AOR compositions; and there is of course "White Knuckles/rocking &rolling;" the definitive hard rock guitar ride. All the above material had surprising-to this day-radio quality that did not make much of an impact in the American market in particular. Moore would disband "G-Force" in the following months yet this album and outfit definitely laid the foundation for the guitarist's career in the extravagant music scene of the 80s.

Although Pontus Norgren is hardly a household name amongst mainstream hard rock/ metal fans, this Swede has had a truly remarkable course within the ranks of AOR- Glam Rock- Heavy Metal; originally with the 80s outfit "Great King Rat", followed by his induction in "Talisman", "JSS" and "Jeckyl & Hyde" during the 90s and early 00s, while settling as a basic member of Glam Rockers "The Poodles" for the past 3 years.In 2000 Pontus recorded his first solo album for "Z Records", "Damage Done". Although this could have proven to be an opportunity for the Swede to pursuit alternative musical direction; Norgren sticks to what he does best by recording a class `A' Hard Rock disc, very much in the vein of "Jekyll & Hyde" albums.Furthermore fans of the Swedish HRock scene are in for a pleasant surprise as this temporary "solo" band featured a name much higher ranked than the guitarist; this being non other than revered metal singer Matts Leven ( Yngwie Malmsteen, "Therion", "Swedish" Erotica).Together the duo guides the listener through a fantastic selection of Hard Rock: with the confident and aggressive "Down an Out" as the opening track, the mega catchy "On my own" as well as other melodic diamonds like "Here I am" and "Friends".This is much more than a guitarist solo album; "Damage Done" stands toe to toe with just about everything Pontus has recorded to date.The more you underestimate this release the more Damage will be done as the album will keep you hooked for more than a while.

"Genesis" is the second album by Swedish-American melodic hard rock band "Talisman" originally released in 1992. Between their 1989 debut and "Genesis", line up changes, record label bankruptcy and turns in musical trends were harsh realities for the group. Still, singer Jeff Scott Soto and bassist Marcel Jacob managed to regroup and reform the band for this second album.Genesis would signify the birth of a sound that took 80s hard rock to another level: the bass lines would become more technical than ever, the drumming more aggressive, the guitar leads more complex while the choruses would remain as catchy as before. Imagine groovy distorted bass line, synchronized guitar/bass leads plus occasonal bass solos. The line up features Jeff Scott Soto on vocals, Marcel Jacob on bass and new entry, young guitar prodigy Fredrik Akersson. Although drums are reported as being programmed in the studio, the video clip of "Mysterious" showed drummer Jake Samuel participating in the studio sesisons."Genesis" established the trademark sound on which the following "Talisman" albums would be based upon also featuring a list of underground melodic classics: "Comin' Home", "Mysterious", "If you would only be my friend", "All or nothing", "All I want" and "Give me a sign". "Genesis" also introduced the band to Japan which would prove a stronghold for the band in the years to come.This edition of the album is a two disc version featuring the orignal album plus the demos of the studio sessions.

"Talisman" is the Swedish-American melodic hard rock band led by iconic AOR vocalist Jeff Scott Soto and bass virtuoso Marcel Jacob. The two musicians would prove the only consistent members throughout the band's musical course beginnig with this self titled album in 1989 up to 2006.This 2003 reissue features the original album PLUS a second CD with most of the songs in Demo version. While the original album is sung entirely by Jeff, the demos feature Goran Edman on vocals; he and Jacob were both part of the line up of the John Norum band so the choice seemed obvious. Still Edman would exit the line up, being offered the lead singer spot in Y.J. Malmsteen's band a move that left Jacob without a singer and little time on his hands. At this point Jacob turned to Jeff Scott Soto another former bandmate of his (the two musicians were original members in Y.J.M. "Rising Force") and "Talisman"s core was formed. The line up would be completed by Christopher Stahl on lead guitar, Jake Samuel (currently "The poodles" frontman) on drums, and Mats Olausson on keyboards.In retrospect "Talisman", as an album, drew considerably on the late 80s hard rock/glam metal style. The compositions are in line with the 80s American glam sound featuing catchy choruses, melodic keyboards and huge drumming, while Jeff Scott Soto deviates from his characteristic vocal and takes a "Europe"-Joey Tempest style of singing. So the band were clearly looking at mainstrean success with this debut album and, to a certain extent, they achieved that as the single version of "I'll be waiting" topped the radio charts. One has to also adress that the production of "Talisman" was definitely ahead of its time, the entire album sounds immense. Favorite tracks include "Break your chains", "I'll be waiting" "Just between us" and "Day by Day".Overall "Talisman" layed the foundation for a melodic hard rock group that would move forward through the unforgiving 90s, batling its way through label disputes and establishing a distinct sound and following.

This 2004 release is a 2CD set featuring "Talisman"s fifth studio album "Truth"(1998) and their second live album "Live at Sweden Rock festival"(2001).Having resolved the legal issues following the release of their fourth album "Life"(1995), Swedish-American melodic hard rock band "Talisman" returned in 1998 to record their 5th studio album "Truth".For the album, lead singer Jeff Scott Soto regroups with bassist Marcel Jacob and drummer Jamie Borger, bringing in new guitarist Pontus Norgren, as Fredrick Akersson became heavily involved with other projects during the three year inactivity of the band.Although just as technical as the preceding albums, "Truth" turned out to be the softest album of "Talisman", relying considerably on cover versions of "Fronzen", "Let me entertain you" and "Darling Nikki". The album is by no means as direct or captivating as "Talisman" is known for being and probably takes a fair amount of plays for one to get used to the material. Favorite tracks include "Until the morning comes", "frozen" and "angel/devil"."Live at Sweden Rock festival" was recorded in 2001 at a time when "Talisman" was theoretically incactive; Still Soto, Jacob and Norgren were found at the time in Sweden working at an entirely new project. Under these circumstances they took the opportunity to appear at the great Swedish festival, playing a 15 track set drawing from all their previous five studio works. Although a top rate performance it does not match the intensity and agression of their firt live album "5 out of 5".Perhaps not the strongest moments of "Talisman" captured here, still an important part in the band's career and a great first documentation of the band in the new millenium.

"Escape into the sun" is the debut solo album by former "Praying Mantis" singer Tony Ohora originally released in 2006. For the solo album to take shape, record label "Frontiers Records" turned to Swedish guitarist/songwriter extraordinaire Magnus Karlsson who has written and performed such highly acclaimed projects as "Kiske-Somerville", "The Codex" and the "Allen-Lande" trilogy. In fact the entire album is written, mixed and produced by the Swede who also performs all guitars, bass, keyboards and programs the drums on "Escape into the sun".For that matter O'Hora's contributing was to perform lead vocals on the songs; but that takes nothing away from the quality of "Escape into the sun". Indeed this album includes what could possibly be some of Karlsson best ever compositions namely the title track, the decimating "Black wings", the huge "No more innocence" and "High enough". In terms of style the album defines the very essence of melodic; from there it falls into melodic AOR, melodic hard rock and melodic metal, depending on the song you pick. And this diversity is very much due to the amazing performing talent of Tony who literally works vocal miracles on the album. He can hit just about every not with incredible precision and clarity and on a personal level I believe "Escape into the sun" is the best showcase of his phenomenal abilities.If you enjoyed albums such as "Allen-Lande", "Kiske-Somerville", "The codex" as well as the latest releases of "Primal Fear", you will probably make the most of "Tony Ohora-Escape into the sun".

This 2003 release is a 2CD set featuring "Life" the 4th studio album by Swedish-American melodic hard rock band "Talisman" accompanied by the the live album "5 out of 5- live in Japan"."Life" originally released in 1995 features the established line of lead singer Jeff Scott Soto, bassist Marcel Jacob, guitarist Frederick Akersson and drummer Jamie Borger. In comparison to the previous two studio offerings one could argue that "Life" perhaps lacks a bit in terms of songwriting, still it is another faithful reproduction of the distinct "Talisman" sound: Distorted and groovy bass compementing perfectly the guitars, inventive drumming, Jeff's undeniably melodic performance and huge choruses, while the instrumental melodies/harmonies have been slightly reduced on "Life".Overall although as technical and catchy as the previous two "Talisman" albums, "Life" does not have the same attack, being a calmer, if one could say, album; never the less it does offer a good number of groovy/melodic hard rockers: "Tears in the sky", "Loveblind" and "All that really matters".Now, regarding the second CD, featuring the live album, one has to comment that "5out of 5" is the earliest recording of the Soto/Jacob/Akersson/Borger line up captured during the Japanese tour in support of their second album "Genesis" in 1992. The line up is litterally on fire and the crystal clear production takes the listener to the frontline of the show. The tracklist strictly features 12 songs from their first two albums, while it is reported that they actually also played songs from their previous bands and cover tunes.

"Messano" is the self titled debut album by melodic hard rock singer/guitarist Bobby Messano originally released in 1989, reissued lately by "Retrospect" records in 2007. Bobby Messano entered the rock scene as a member of "Starz" and performed on a session basis throughout the `80s for various highly acclaimed artists in the genres of AOR, melodic hard rock and glam metal. This particular reissue features the original 11-track album plus five additional songs.So with a total of 16 songs on offer you should expect that the Messano debut touches just about every style of `80s rock; from the opening melodic rocker "Hide our love away" to the acoustically driven "You and I", to the double bass attack of "Rock'n roll Heaven" and the keyboard driven "Stand and Fight", Messano proves a very well rounded album.It becomes clear that Bobby's experience with various artists have impacted on "Messano" sounding admirably diverse. No question, vocally and instrumentally Messano is more than accomplished, though perhaps his songwriting is not quite in the same league as contemporaries Kip Winger and Paul Sabu.Overall the Messano debut is as complete a slice of `80s rock as it gets; it is by no means flawless but should provide a satisfactory experience to the genre's enthusiast particularly those who collect melodic rock albums of that era.

"Blessed be" is the 5th studio album by Finnish glam metal/goth rock band "The 69 Eyes" originally released in 2000. The line up features Jussi 69 (d), Bazie (g), Jyrki (v), Archzie (b) and Timo-Timo (g). In retrospect the "blessed be" is probably the coloses "69 Eyes" got to Goth rock as a subgenre.The hard rock side of the band is definitely traceable as the guys do not neglect their riffs and guitar solos as well as the rocking rhythm section; still it is the production of the album, more than anything, that makes "Blessed be" a Gothic rock album: for that matter the clean instrumentations are brought up fron in the mix, delivering all the essential gothic melodies while Jyrki's vocals have become incredibly bass, perhaps overproduced on some songs sounding rather unnatural yet definitely adding to the gothic atmosphere.The material on offer is actually very consistent in terms of songwriting and performance quality; still one would expet more tempo variety from one song to the next and perhaps a few more aggressive or hard rocking if you will, tunes that do not come by on "Blessed be". Favoritet tracks inclide: "Framed in blood", "Brandon Lee", "Velvet touch" and "Sleeping with lions".Image wise the band has also moved away from the glamorous style, dressed in black with booklet band photos as well as cover artwork being barely visible on the CD version of the album. So cleary " The 69 Eyes" decided to place all the emphasis on the music throught this 5th album, putting style aside.

"Paris Kills" is the 6th studio album by Finnish glam metal/goth rock band "The 69 eyes" originally released in 2002. And before moving into details, one has to comment that "Paris Kills" is an amazing title for an album of this genre.Although most would consider "Paris Kills" as the second part of the preceding album "Blessed be", hence going down the same path musically, I feel strongly that "Paris Kills" is actually the first album where " The 69 eyes" attempt to combine both sides of their musical personality, the glamorous and the gothic. Although this glam/goth hybrid would be perfected in the following "Angels-Devils" saga, `Paris Kills' was probably the first stept in that direction.Having already become stars of the genre with their previous album, "The 69 eyes" inject more rockstar attitude in their goth rock, translating musically in more uptempo songs and bigger/more aggressive choruses. For that matter the more one plays the album the more one feels that underlying David Bowie-esque rock'n'roll essence. The vocals come across more natural than on their previous work being equally bass yet more melodic and less processed. Favorite tracks include "crashing high", "Dance d'amour", "Betty Blue", "Don't turn your back on fear" and "Forever more".One could say in retrospect that "Paris Kills" is a classic glam/goth album that sought to combine two styles demonstrating demonstrate common characteristics and for that matter moved musically in areas where no band or album had attempted to explore.

"The hand is quicker than the eye" is the debut album by guitarist Joshua Perahia, originally released in 1983. This CD is a 2001 reissue by "M&K; Sound" simply featuring the 8-track original album. Though "Joshua" would become widely recognised as a glam metal/melodic hard rock outfit from the mid 80s-onwards, this early release leans towards AOR/melodic rock, not dissimilar to the sound of "Journey" or "Foreigner".The line up features lead singer Stephen Fontaine, bassist Mahlon Hawk, drummer Tony Zaccaglin and key-player Donnie Gougeon alongside Joshua who uncovers a great deal of his talent on "The hand...". Joshua unmistakably comes out as a shredder on this debut, despite being adult oriented rock-a fact experienced by the listener as early as the opening of the second track, the hit single "November is going away". For that matter the lead guitar work on "The hand..." is definitely ahead of its time with best example being the first solo of "Broken dream".Beyond Joshua's technical proficiency, one has to address that the songwriting is of very high quality: while including a few up-lifting rockers such as "Flying high" and "Sweet `lil hurricane", the record bares a strong melancholic essence; for experienced fans that fact probably translates into AOR-brilliance as the entire album is full of heart-felt performances and, for that matter, "November is going away" becomes the tip of the spear of the melodic sensation that is Joshua's debut.

"Strangeways" is the self-titled debut album by the UK melodic hard rock/AOR band originally released in 1986, reissued in 2006 by `Majestic Rock'. This early all-British line up features lead singer Tony Liddel, guitarist Ian Stewart, bassist Dave Stewart and drummer Jim Drummond."Strangeways" play an explosive mix of melodic hard rock and adult oriented rock featuring huge rhythm section, flamboyant melodic guitar lines, indispensable keyboard harmonies and intense vocal performances. Even on this early work, "Strangeways" are every bit the melodic masters that fans have come to recognize once Terry Brock joined the ranks. All performances are turned to 11 on this debut as the quartet leaves nothing to the imagination.Songs like the opener "The kid needs love", "Hold Back your love", "Heartbreak Zone", "Power Play" and "Breaking Down the Barriers" are some of the best melodic rock songs to come out of the UK during the `80s. One could argue that for a band aiming at serious airplay and mainstream melodic rock appeal, "Strangeways" had set the creative bar way too high, and though catchy as the tunes were they were far to aggressive/intense for conventional taste. Still if you enjoy technically overblown yet straight to the point AOR, you need to check the "Strangeways" debut out.

"Majestic" is a Swedish neoclassical metal band and "Trinity overture" is their second album originally released in 2000. "Majestic", the brain child of keyboardist Richard Andersson was to be the first in a list of three musical outfits the musician would come to form, the other two being "Space odyssey" and "Time Requiem".The line up features beyond Andersson, lead singer Apollo Papathanasio ("Firewind", "Evil Masquerade"), guitarist Magnus Nordh, bassist Martin Wezowski and drummer Peter Wildoer. For the biggest part, "Trinity Overture" is keyboard driven neoclassical metal with emphasis on vocals. For that matter guitars are rather complementary, mostly reserved to rhythm parts (although occasionally contributing melodic lines and a number of solos) while the rhythm section is upbeat, still not particularly aggressive. Clearly Andersson, having composed the entire album, is the instrumental protagonist of "Majestic" with the rest of the band following on the melodies that his keyboards lay, still it has to adressed that he has placed emphasis on composing appropriate and rather memorable choruses that mostly suit Apollo's voice, standing as the album's strongest characteristic.The album also benefits from a clear production, prioritizing the melodic aspects of "Majestic's" sound which perhaps takes away a fair amount of attack from the perfromances while also making the album more conventient audio-wise. Favorite tracks include "Voodoo Tresure", "The rapture of Canaan", "Confusicus" and "Trinity overture".

This is the debut album by iconic AOR singer/songwriter/guitarist Stan Bush, originally released in 1983. Marketed a good couple of years prior to the melodic hard rock/glam metal explosion which would dominate the rest of the decade, the Stan Bush record was built on the principles of early `80s melodic rock- one could roughly describe it as a mixture of "Survivor" and "Asia".Despite being his first solo effort, the Stan Bush debut is filled with challenging vocal melodies, changes in rhythm patterns and constantly evolving harmonies. No question, the end result is catchy-radio friendly rock, though very organic, baring various twists and turns (you will even notice the basic key of the song changing before the verse or chorus.)In comparison to his later works and commercial highlights, the debut album is by far the most youthful in terms of the lyrical themes and stories uncovered in its songs. From the opening "It's Hot", to its successor "Fire in my heart" you know this is going to prove a no-nonsense melodic rock album, vibrant and passionate from the first song to the last. "Love has taken me away" and "Say the word" are evidence of a more mature Bush and glimpses of what his music would evolve in the years to come.To his credit Stan has written, or co-written, all songs but one on this debut while performing all vocals and guitars. One should note that the album has some pretty challenging guitar solos and some unconventional melodic lines which Stan manages to put across very convincingly. In addition, his vocal performance is by far the most versatile to be found on any of his albums with a range and tone that perfectly justify him being amongst the most lasting artists in AOR.If you enjoy melodic rock/AOR in the style of "Survivor" (Jamison era), "Export" and "Asia" then Stan's debut stands as a guarantee.

"Wired up" is the second solo album by American songwriter/singer Jeff Paris originally released in 1987. Having already been established himself as a top AOR/melodic rock songwriter having written for Lita Ford, and put forward his solo career, this second album would establish him as a solo artist; featuring beyond Jeff on lead vocals, guitarist Michael Thompson, drummer Matt Sorum and bassist Gary Moon.Despite the glamorous image that the band put forward on "Wired Up", the album has a clear AOR identity, strongly differentiated from the glam/sleaze metal sound of the time. The vast majority of "Wired up" is written by Jeff Paris who would collaborate with various external songwriters on these ten songs. Although a musically solid release throughout, it would be fair to say that there is a song here that effectively overshadows the rest of the compositions. "Cryin", the AOR radio hit, arguably sums up all the qualities that make melodic rock a great genre; the guitar riffs, the keyboard melodies, the stimulating rhythm section and of course the choruses. (The song would also be performed by all female glam metal band "Vixen")Other standouts include "One night alone", "Illusions" and "Wired Up" which is a close as the album gets to the hair/glam metal sound. Overall "Wired Up" although far from the lengthiest or most complete work in the Paris catalogue, is probably the one that stands out the most, effectively establishing Paris as a solo act rather than just a great songwriter.

"Freelight" is the fourth and latest to date album by Canadian melodic rock band "Final Frontier", originally released in 2006. The outfit was founded by lead singer Rob Moratti ("Saga") and guitarist Mladen Haze ("Von Groove"). On this fourth album, however, guitar duties are divided between Mladen and Lawrence Falcomer, bass is handled by Robbie Zee while drums are performed by Stu Reid."Freelight" is true to the vision of the founders to deliver high quality melodic rock in `80s style. On this album Rob Moratti makes extensive use of his highest singing which might require some getting used to by those unfamiliar with his previous works; still the singer is technically impeccable and consistently melodic throughout the album. Overall the album is surprisingly uplifting and merry, songs like "All the way", "Dynamo", "I hope you don't mind" are totally indicative of the positive nature of "Freelight". On the other hand there is "Foolish pride", and "Nothing is easy" being the other side of the coin, both dramatic tunes dealing with the love/hate subject that never goes out of fashion; "Foolish pride" in particular is probably the album's strongest moment.The production of the album could be characterized as subtle, which is to be expected by a melodic rock/AOR release; Essentially the vocals and guitars are the protagonist instruments on "Freelight" while keyboards drums and bass complement the songs while granting each song its AOR identity. Above all do not be discouraged by the album's front cover which would probably fit better on a prog/atmospheric release- "Final Frontier-Freelight" is 80s oriented melodic rock and amongst the best on offer.

"Blood on the bricks" is the fourth studio album by melodic rock songwriter/singer/guitarist Aldo Nova originally released in 1991,( reissued in 2004 by "Lemon Recordings"). "Blood on the bricks" was to be Nova's final album in the melodic rock genre to date; in contrast to his debut, this last offering is a far more collective effort since the album in its entirety is composed between Aldo and Jon Bon Jovi.It has to be clear however that "Blood on the bricks" does not quite sound like a "Bon Jovi" album because it is essentially based on grooves rather than melodies, a fact some may find surprising since Aldo was one of the first melodic rock solo artists to debut in the `80s. No question "Blood...", for the biggest part, features large choruses and memorable vocal harmonies, but it does not bare the same intensity as earlier albums. Exceptions to the above observation are the melodic rocker `Touch of madness' and the power ballad "Hey Ronnie".The line up features Nova on guitars and lead vocals, renowned drummer Kenny Aronoff and bassist Randy Jackson; those familiar with the works of the latter two musicians should be hardly surprised of the groovy orientation of the album. "Blood on the bricks" is indeed the last of Aldo in `80s rock and a historic collaboration between two legends of the scene.

In 1997 bassist vocalist Mat Sinner , one of the most consistent forces of German melodic hard rock/metal since the early 80s', collaborated with lead singer extraordinaire Ralf Scheepers (ex-"Gamma Ray"), the latter would contribute backing vocals on what was to be `Sinner's biggest selling album to date, "The nature of evil" (1997) .With the resurgence of European power metal in the late 90s, Sinner and Scheepers put together a power metal project under the name of "Primal Fear". The line up consisted of Ralf on lead vocals, Matt on bass and backing vocals, `Sinner' guitarist Tom Newman and drummer Klaus Sperling. Their combination of high pitched vocal attack, metallic riffs, twin guitar melodies, extensive solos and inventive double bass drumming. In retrospect, it would be fair to say that their musical approach was amongst the most advanced/sophisticated sounds the power/melodic metal genre had produced mainly because `Primal Fear' effectively combined only the best elements of the rock-metal genre while performing the material with indescribable intensity. The `Primal Fear' concept was rewarded by considerable chart entries in Europe and Japan.The album holds one of the most characteristic songs of the band, "Chainbreaker", along with the devastating `Silver and gold", the melodically agonizing "Thunderdome", and one of the greatest power ballads in their catalogue "Tears of rage" which would be the first in a list of mind blowing power ballads to follow in their other albums.Overall I could not consider the "Primal Fear" debut as anything less than a classic metal album, and automatically established the new project as a full time band. A major shock to 90s power metal that would go from strength to strength in the years to come.

While in the process of departing from the metal band "Masterplan" in 2006, drummer extraordinaire Uli Kusch had already put together a new recording line-up for his up coming release "Beautiful Sin-the unexpected". For a project that was not to stand too far apart from "Masterplan" musically, one could in retrospect claim that Uli assembled his line up wisely.The line up features beyond Uli, former "Masterplan" band-mate Axel Mackenrott on keyboards plus members of Jorn Lande's solo band, guitarist Viggo Lofstad and bassist Steinar Krokmo. The line up is completed by Belgian female singer Magali Lyuten; although a newcomer at the time, Lyuten is indeed the focal point of "Beautiful sin', with a powerful-mid to bass singing voice that provides the depth to support the melodic/progressive song-writing on "The unexpected".For that matter the musical approach on "beautiful sin" is almost identical to "Masterplan" in fact one could easily see songs like "I'm real", "Take me home" and "The original dream" be a part of "Masterplan"s repertoire. Although the quality of "Beautiful Sin" as a band and album would come close to the standards of "Masterplan", their debut "The unexpected" stands as their only release to date. For fans of Jorn, "Pagan's mind" and "Masterplan", "Beautiful sin" is more of the same great sound.

"Violent new breed" turned out to be the ideal artistic return for original "W.A.S.P." guitarist Randy Piper. Through the release of this album in 2006, Piper recaptured the mid 80s "W.A.S.P." formula adding more aggression, melody and catchiness than before. In fact `Animal' remains faithful to the original "W.A.S.P." sound while producing new/original songs of undeniable substance.It definitely comes down to making careful choices on the line up. First and foremost he recruits lead singer Rich Lewis whose tone and vocal approach is nearly identical to Blackie Lawless- a prerequisite in recreating the original sound. Piper also brings on board Swedish glam/sleaze metaler Chris Laney on the position of lead guitar. The Swede is one of the most remarkable forces of hair metal internaltionally, having produced albums for "Crashdiet", "Crazy Lixx", "Dynazty" and "Candlemass" amongst others while having two solo albums under his belt and participated in various bands of this genre.On this basis, `Animal' have delivered an incredible album true to the `W.A.S.P' sound, only more menacing and totally uncensored, particularly on the subject of lyrics. For that matter although the riffs, the choruses the leads and melodies are totally reminiscent of the original band, `Animal' is much darker than anything `W.A.S.P.' have come up with. And it is that fact that makes songs like `The morning After', `Salt', `Animal in me' and `In the mirror' so intimidating and memorable."Violent new breed" is a true achievement for Randy Piper's band that should appeal to any fan of `W.A.S.P." particularly admirers of their early work and seasoned fans. A musical triumph and an overall must.

"Nuclear Fire" is the third studio album by German power metal band "Primal Fear" originally released in 2001. "Nuclear Fire" would prove one of the highest selling albums of "Primal Fear" to date while establishing a firm presence for the band into the millennium.In retrospect, a number of reasons appear to justify the success of "Nuclear Fire"; foremost it was the first album to feature the `Space tales' concept, with lyrical themes evolving around a crew of heroes battling their way through space, facing a number of challenges. This lyrical format arguably allowed for more intense performances, aggressive lyrics all covered by an agonizing feeling. Another potentially contributing factor to the success of the album is the addition of the first "Primal Fear" promo video for the song "Angel in Black".In terms of technique "Nuclear Fire" is filled with devastating riffs, twin guitar melodies, catastrophic rhythm section and intimidating high pitched vocals. Regarding the band's formation, the album saw the first line up change for "Primal Fear" with guitarist Henny Wolter replacing Tom Newmann, joining Ralf Scheepers (v), Mat Sinner (b), Stefan Leibing (g) and Klaus Sperling (d). Favorite tracks include "Iron fist in a velvet glove", "Red Rain", "Now or never", "Angel in black" and " Nuclear Fire"."Nuclear Fire" was another step in the ascending course of "Primal Fear" introducing the name into new markets while also establishing the group as a headlining act (touring wise) internationally.

"Final Frontier" is the melodic rock project of "Von Groove" guitarist Mladen Haze and "Saga" lead singer Rob Moratti; "The first wave", as the title suggests, is their debut album originally released in 2002. The musical style of "Final Frontier" does not deviate from the melodic rock/AOR of "Von Groove" with the main point of differentiation being Moratti's lead vocals. The line up is completed by drummer Roger Banks and bassist Piero Greco.For that matter, one might be surprised at the height of Moratti's vocal notes (which he does not use all the time.) The singer demonstrates a clean and powerful melodic voice which shines through the verses and choruses. From the vocal intro of "Forever's a heartbeat away" any experienced fan of the genre, should be able to foresee the AOR journey that "Final Frontier" will be taking the listener on. Mladen on the other hand adds his characteristic melodic lines with the expected 80's touch that grants "Final Frontier" its old-school essence.The chemistry of Rob and Mladen is undeniable, as they do come up with AOR/melodic rock hymns like "The last to know", "The power", "Two strangers" and "Restless Heart" that still hold their own today. Overall "Final Frontier" is a strong release in the AOR/melodic rock genre that does not stand apart from the member's previous works, still it offers more great songs to the fans and genre.

In 1998 a Finnish-American combination emerged by the name of "Kenziner". A very promising outfit at the time, "Kenziner" elevated the vision of guitar player Jarno Keskinen who effectively attempted to take all known axioms of neoclassical metal and place them into progressive metal surroundings. The band also featured the incomparable performances of American singer Stephen Frederick.After two albums the band disbanded, Keskinen changed his name to Jaron Sebastian Raven and put together "Virtuocity" in 2001, a totally Finnish band but just the same sound wise to "Kenziner". If you have heard Jaron's music before you can be sure what to expect; the truth and the matter is that when one decides to specialize music ("progressive neoclassical metal" in this case) creative borders become extremely narrow while repetition is, after a certain point, inevitable. "Virtuocity" is unfortunately no exception; you get nothing new from Jarno here, riffs, melodies and drum patterns are very familiar to his previous works while vocalist P.J. Goodman fails to deliver the power, atmosphere and overall originality of Stephen Frederick.If all you need is more of the same, then consider this as a five out of five. Still if you expect the band's creative levels to have risen to new territories then "Virtuocity" will fall short to your expectations.

Australian guitar hero Stu Marshall is back with the third installment of his all-star melodic-power metal project "Empires of Eden" entitled "Channeling the Infinite". For those unfamiliar with the project, "Empires of Eden" is the very definition of grandiose/ambitious melodic metal, a construct built on blinding guitar shredding, exemplary rhythm section and an amazing cast of star vocalists."Channeing the Infinite" welcomes back vocalists Steve Grimmett, Louie Gorgievski, Sean Peck and Carlos Zema (all four appeared on the previous album "Reborn in Fire"), plus new-old metal legends as Udo Dirkschneider, Rob Rock, Ronny Munroe, Mike Dimeo, Danny Cecati and Alessandro Del Vecchio.One could argue that "Empires of Eden" prioritize technique and exhibitionism at all levels over songwriting which is a somewhat of a fair assessment on account of "Channeling the Infinite". Still those familiar with this musical franchise have come to expect stellar technique and good songwriting by the personas involved, and that combination has become something of a trademark for this heavy franchise.The futuristic heavy metal essence of "Empires of Eden" should be considered a trademark of the outfit by now, creating a atmosphere (not sound) similar to early "Primal Fear". As mentioned above despite the somewhat stereotypical songwriting, the outwardly performances will keep you hooked from the opening notes of "Cry out" to the closing of "Born a King".Overall, I have to give "Channeling the Infinite" five stars simply because it comes out so intimidating, technical and intense as power metal has rarely sounded in this latest decade. You could claim that melodic metal gets better than "Empires of Eden", though it certainly does not get any bigger than this!

German guitar hero `Alex Beyrodt' is probably known as the mastermind behind power metal acts such as `Silent Force' and neoclassical metal project `Voodoo Circle'. Originally released in 1998, `The Sygnet'-`Children of the future' is probably the most overlooked project in the guitarist's career.Beyrodt entered the international metal scene in 1995 as the guitarist of German metal band `Sinner' and remained a full time member until 2000. Through that period Alex also served as session player, having recorded the guitars for `Jaded Hearts' second and third album Slaves and masters (1996) and `Mystery Eyes' (1998). It was at that time that Alex would come to put together an entirely new project/band with `Jaded Heart' members, lead singer Michael Bormann and bass player Michael Muller, also joined by drum prodigy Andre Hilgers (soon to be `Silent Force' drummer).One could actually regard `The Sygent' as an early version of `Silent Force' as the similarities in sound, approach, cover artwork and album title are hard to ignore. For that matter `The Sygnet' sounds exactly like the `Silent Force' debut, perhaps slightly downbeat in comparison to the later album with the obvious difference of lead vocals. The production is also of high quality, yet you will probably be able to tell that `Children of the Future' is a late `90s recording.Favorite songs include `Unload the gun', `Children of the future', `Tears of rage and Tragedy'. Overall `The Sygnet'- `Children of the Future' is a must for any fan of `Silent Force'; also, if you have followed any of the bands referenced above you will probably enjoy this album just as much.

"Eye of the Tiger" is the third studio album by American melodic rock band `Surivor' originally released in 1981. "Eye of the Tiger" was the peak of the Dave Bickler-fronted `Survivor' commercially and for many artistically as well. It seems that "Eye of the Tiger" is constantly undermined by its legendary title-track while it does feature plenty of solid melodic rock tunes at its own right."Eye of the tiger" introduced a sound built on catchy keyboard harmonies, rhythm guitars which combined with the popular drumming and clearly audible bass which became the basis for `80s adult oriented rock, melodic rock and subsequently glam metal. Beyond its title track, "Eye of the tiger" features far more melodic moments such as "Feels like love", "The one that really matters", the balladic "I'm not that man anymore" where the listener comes to appreciate the complete spectrum of "Survivor"s style, referring to the twin guitar melodies, the effective backing/choir vocals and the piano phrases. One also has to mention "Children of the Night" which is an early glimpse of the glam metal sound that would develop in the years following.Overall "Eye of the tiger" is a statement in melodic rock that bares substance throughout its track-list. For those who have enjoyed the song but have not experienced the entire album, chances are you will be surprised at how many great tunes this album holds.

"Lion" originally released in 1989. The band is commonly recognized as the collaboration of American guitar prodigy Doug Aldrich ("Hurricane", "Dio", "Whitesnake") with British vocal titan Kal Swan ("Tytan", "Kuni") (hence the flags on the front cover).On a personal level, I have to comment that "Trouble in Angel City" is probably my favorite hard rock album of 1989 because it combined incredible songwriting -track after track-and immense performances on all instruments. One could not overlook that the same year bands like "Whitesnake" and "Vain" put to tape some of the genre's most iconic performances, still "Lion"'s final album, dare-I-say, slightly surpasses them.First of all, "Trouble.." finds Doug a more mature, technical and flamboyant guitarist, clearly developing in the guitar hero most are aware of today, his style on "Trouble.." comes very close to that of Vito Bratta and Michael Sweet.Kal Swan is a vocalist at the top of his game, in his over the top epic style of singing, confidence plays the biggest part and the singer has tons of it. One would go as far as saying that on "Trouble..." he is at the same level (not sound) as Kip Winger and David Coverdale. (Although the vocal approaches of the latter two vocalists have been copied/incorporated by singers that followed them, there still seems to be no one to quite match the very characteristic vocal attack of Kal Swan)Perhaps the album's greatest achievement is the fact that at no point does it deviate from the up tempo melodic hard rock/glam metal; most would agree that commonly glam metal albums would incorporate elements/songs of AOR, blues rock etc, but "Lion" is from the opening track `Come on' to the closing `Forgotten Sons' thoroughbred melodic hard rock. Standout tracks? Absolutely all, "Can't stop the rain", "Victim of Circumstance", "Hold on", "Forgotten sons", "Lock up your daughters", all this is material that unquestionably stands the test of time- a true classic of the genre.

This is the debut album by renowned American glam metal band "White Lion". Originally released in 1984 the recording process of this album was financed by "Electra Records", a company which at the time had one power seller under the name of "Motley Crue". However just when the album was completed "Electra" dropped the band replacing them with an up and coming quartet known as "Dokken". Never the less "JVC" showed great interest in White Lion and the album was released in Japan.Musically this album goes way beyond the glam metal sound of its successor "Pride". This is hard rock or classic metal as some would like to refer to; No "hair metal" hits here, rather solid rock hymns. Mike Tramp's music pays a tribute to the modern urban life with songs such as "In the City" and the title track. In addition, tunes such as "Cherokee" and "All the fallen men" stand as homage to the predecessors and heroes of the American nation.Nothing glamorous, nothing pretentious here; overall a very dark, often mid tempo album whose choruses deliver the pain, agony and self examination of the average modern citizen.Weather you prefer "poser rock" or straight forward "heavy metal" you can invest confidently on this release; this could possibly be the most substantial American hard rock album of the 80s.It is quite ironic the least successful release in White Lion's multi-platinum history stands out as their most diachronic and inspirational album.

Two years past the release of "Live at Rock in Rio" DVD (2008), the metal God Rob Halford releases his second live DVD "Live in Anaheim". The release captures the metal God and his solo band in 2003, in support of their second studio album "Crucible", mere months before Halford would rejoin "Judas Priest".The line up that performs on stage is quite different to the one that recorded "Crucible". Beyond Rob, one finds original guitarist Mike Chlasciak and orignal drummer Bobby Zarzombeck, bassist Mike Davies has replaced Ray Riendeau and Roy Z ("Driver", "Rob Rock") takes over guitar duties from Pat Lachman. (Basically we are looking at the same line up that recorded the latest "Halford" album "Made of metal" in 2010).The Programme on this DVD, is divided in two parts: The first part features footage of the recording process of "Crucible" along with interviews of all the musicians mentioned above plus four songs recorded during the Japanese leg of the "Crucible" tour (professionally shot and recorded). The second part of the DVD is the entire 19-track show "Halford" played at Anaheim, also professionally captured at stereo and 5.1. Surround sound. One has to agree that the picture quality could have been clearer, yet as it is, it takes nothing away from the enjoyment of the performance, as the `Halford' band is once again in top form performing material from Rob's two solo albums, "Fight" tunes as well as "Priest" classics.Overall, "Live at Anaheim" is a complete as it gets music DVD being a great live concert as it is a great band documentary. This DVD really holds a ton of great heavy metal moments.

"Live insurrection" is the first solo live album from the Metal God Rob Halford originally released in 2001. Recorded during the "Resurrection" world tour 2000-2001 in support of Halford's debut album, "Live..." is a complete 2CD/27track live album capturing songs throughout the singer's career; most of the tracks of the "Resurrection" debut are featured live on this release plus highlights of Halford's 90's group "Fight" and of course a long list of "Judas Priest" classics. Closing the package are reworked studio versions of "Heart of a lion" and "Prisoner of your eyes" plus a new-at the time-studio track "Screaming in the dark".The line up on this live album is the same that cut "Resurrection" in the studio, featuring US guitar hero `Metal'-Mike Chlasciak, drummer extraordinaire Bobby Jarzombeck, guitarist Patrick Lachman and bassist Ray Riendeau. The band's performance is indeed amazing going through Halford's 30 year music catalogue with incredible precision and fluency. All riffs, melodies, solos and drum patents are faithfully recreated on these recordings while Rob's vocal performance is outstanding hitting all notes with accuracy and sustain.Some of the performances as well as cover photos of this album seem to be taken from `Halford's show at the `Rock in Rio 2001' festival. Still this live album is not the audio equivalent of the "Halford-Rock in Rio" DVD released three years ago as "Live insurrection" features a more extensive track-list and considerably different performances of the songs. Overall "Live insurrection" is amongst the greatest heavy metal live albums released in the new millennium and it is still a thrilling listen, ten years past its release.

"Rock ain't Dead" is the second studio album by British melodic hard rock band "Heavy Pettin", originally released in 1985, reissued by "Majestic Rock" in 2003. Though often regarded as a NWOBHM group, "Heavy Pettin" actually debuted a year later in 1983; in addition the band brought to front a sound and image that hard more in common with American AOR and glam metal than British heavy metal.In fact "Heavy Pettin"s melodic hard rock style has been further smoothened on this second album sounding incredibly similar to fellow UK melodic hard rockers "Shy". You can expect over-produced rhythm section, melodic guitar lines (which turn into crystal clean chords during the power ballads), moderate use of background keyboards and high pitched, but overly melodic, vocals in the style of Tony Mills and Tony Harnell.The line up features lead singer Hamie, guitarist Punky Mendoza and Gordon Bonnar, bassist Brian Waugh and drummer Gary Moat. In terms of songwriting "Heavy Pettin" is built on the same catchy hooks and rhythm patterns found on a "Def Leppard" album, though the delivery, as mentioned above, is far more rocking. "Rock ain't Dead" holds a fair amount of powerful melodic rockers in "Heart Attack", "China Boy", the power ballads "Lost in Love" and "Dream time" and the super dramatic "Sole Survivor"-an unforgettable chorus by any means. Conclusively if you are a fan of the 80s melodic rock scene of the UK, "Heavy Pettin"s second album should work perfectly for you.

"Lost in the Translation" is the second solo album by American singer Jeff Scott Soto, originally released in 2004. In contrast to its predecessor "Prism", "Lost..." turned out to be much more of a classic sounding AOR album with Jeff effectively going back to the roots.On "Lost..." Jeff performs beyond lead vocals, keyboards and bass while the guitars are handled by Howie Simon and Gary Schutt while drums are contributed by Glen Sobel. Songwriting-wise song structures are fairly reminiscent of Soto's Swedish band "Talisman" as many of the songs seem to have been written on bass. In terms of performance "Lost.." draws considerably upon the early `80s works of such melodic rock giants as "Journey" and "Foreigner". In fact Neil Schon actually guest on the album by playing the guitars on the opening song "Believe in me" (which would lead into the "Soul SirKus" project a year later). Songs like "Soul Divine", "Hight Time", "Find our way" as well as the title track are prime examples of JSS-AOR.Overall while having no particular surprises in store for the listener "Lost..." is a substantially more cohesive work than his debut. Arguably the only one out of Jeff's three solo albums to fit perfectly within the melodic rock genre, "Lost in the translation" is a strong AOR album that still holds its own seven years past its release.

"Soundchaser" is the 13th studio album by German heavy/power metal heroes "Rage" originally released in 2003. "Soundchaser" is generally regarded by fans as the greatest moment of the particular line up, featuring founder bassist/vocalist Peavey Wagner, guitar virtuoso Victor Smolski and drum hero Mike Terrana."Soundchaser" is commonly considered to be a concept album, lyrically uncovering the nature and origins of "Soundchaser", the predator creature portrayed on the front cover. Subsequently you can expect sci-fi lyrical themes with songs serving as chronicles. Songwriting wise, "Soundchaser" holds some of the best choruses `Rage' have ever come up with, combined with the greatest instrumentations. In terms of performance, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that all three members deliver the best of their abilities (at the time): Peavey sings more harmoniously and intensely than ever before, Victor lays his masterful solos and inventive leads while Mike goes through an impossible variety of grooves and tempos throughout the album.Songs like "Human metal" , "Defenders of the ancient world", "Great old ones" and "Flesh and blood" have probably earned their status as classic metal material which one will be playing forever. Overall "Soundchaser" serves as a great introductory album to "Rage" and their music, totally indicative of their abilities and musical vision; a classic indeed.

A classic 80s hard rock album with typical sound and songwriting. The second lion album does not have any particular standout tracks with the exception of "After the fire" and even in this case the rhythm section of the song seems identical to "The holy war", a track by Thin Lizzy.Never the less, this album establishes the potential of at least one of its members, guitarist Doug Aldrich (appearing first on the left side of the frond cover), today recognized as David Cloverdale's number one axe man of choice in Whitesnake.

Without knowing practically anything about "Sahara steel", I decided to purchase it on the strength of the `Perris' label the company behind this release which has come up with some quite impressive melodic hard rock/glam metal works over the past few years."Sahara Steel" were active during the early 90s at a time where glamorous hard rock was fading out of the mainstream it was at that time and after supporting a fair number of known American glam metal bands that they recorded this, their self titled album. Beyond this information any other specifics are fairly hard to make out; for that matter I can not find the original release date of `Sahara Steel'. Yet perhaps what is most important is that Perris records supported this reissue, having brought in star producer Anthony Focx to re master the album. The drumming is really up front the opening guitar riffs are turned to 11 while the vocals retain their protagonist role.It would be fair to say that `Sahara Steel' sound much heavier and aggressive than one would expect from a hard rock/glam metal band; having said that I can not suggest whether this was the band's own musical direction or simply the 2010 re mastering that gave the album this harder edge.The line up features a fair amount of talent; Patrick Sheppard is a very accomplished guitarist moving effortlessly between the styles of Van Halen, Gary Moore and a bit George Lynch. Lead singer Jack Klunder is also a force to be reckoned with sounding very much like a combination of Matt Matijevic and David Reece. Drummer Brian Eckhart sounds very much like he is fighting wars behind the drum set while bass player Mark Moore follows the frenetic rhythmic effortlessly.Personal favorites include the opening track `Fatal Heartbreaker', `Save your preyers' and `Push comes to shove'. For fans of first generation glam metal bands `Sahara Steel' is a definite buy.

"1001 nights" is the debut album by British melodic hard rock band "Arabia" originally released in 2001. The band led by powerhouse vocalist John Blaze features lead guitarist T.J. Jonlan, drummer Bobby Marks and bassist D.S. James. "Arabia" delivered one of the greatest arena hard rock albums of the new millennium as if it was 1988.A courageous move for its time, "1001" features big drumming, extensive guitar melodies and shredding plus outstanding vocal performances. There is an oriental melodic element on most songs which does not undermine the `80s style of the song-writing and performances. Clearly the focal point of "Arabia" is singer John Blaze who combines the best of Graham Bonnet, Steve Lee, Kip Winger and Paul Sabu while bringing aggression rarely heard in the genre.Above all, it is the intensity in the performances that makes "Arabia" an authentic arena rock album, the musicians perform on "1001 nights" as if their lives depended on it and have succeeded in crafting a timeless melodic hard rock album that holds its own a decade past its release and, in fact, is more relevant today than it was a decade ago: "Till the day I die", "1001 nights", "Dark side of love" and "Mariah" are unsurpassable melodic hard rock pieces. For that matter it is hardly surprising that "Arabia" are actually releasing their second album this summer. Melodic hard rock rarely sounded more convincing than "Arabia- 1001 nights".

"Nothin' but trouble" is the second studio album by melodic hard rock band "Blue Murder" originally released in 1993. The band established by guitar hero John Sykes ("Whitesnake", "Thin Lizzy") remerged four years past their debut under a new line up, featuring drummer Tommy O'Steen and bassist extraordinaire Marco Mendoza.In comparison to the "Blue murder" debut, "...Trouble" retains the very high technical standards the group established in the late `80s, still the songwriting takes a considerable turn towards a groovier and less melodic sound. The lyrics once again cover rather diverse areas such as drug abuse, outlaw life and heartbreak. The album opens on the dynamic, fast paced rocker "We all fall down" which is one of the greatest tunes on the album. Still the real musical feat of the album is "Cry for love", a heartbreaker rocker turned 7-minute epic thanks to the titanic groove of Tommy and Marco; once again John's guitar shines throughout reaching a climactic solo which should be considered amongst his greatest lead guitar works. From there onwards there is the snake-styled ballad "Save my love" and the acoustic cover of "Itchycoo park" that forcefully stand out."Nothin' but trouble" was to be the last studio release by "Blue Murder" as the group would be renamed after their founder as "Sykes" which also signifies a turn in markets as the following albums would aim primarily at the Japanese audience. The live album that followed, effectively closed the "Blue Murder" chapter.

"Pieces" is the debut album by German AOR singer Sam Alex originally released in 2004. A member of the German melodic rock scene since the mid 80s, Sam Alex fronted "Avalon", "Sheela" and "Tokyo Rose".In this personal release Sam is supported by guitarist Bobby Altvater, drummer Michael Schwager and keyboardist Armin Woods.To be fair, "Pieces" could as much be considered a melodic hard rock album as an AOR release since it is all guitar driven performance and songwriting. As in his previous projects, keyboard presence is proven just as big a part of the album's sound. Stylistically "Pieces" draws closer to the sound of American AOR than German melodic rock; for that matter the songs are very well shaped, bound to sound fresh and interesting even amongst the most experienced of fans of the genre. "Hold on", "Tears Falling", "Get it on" and "Saturday night" are songs that manage to sound authentic with the potential of reaching classic status.It is also surprising that the three cover-versions of the songs "Dancing with tears in my eyes", "Magic Breeze" and "Sounds like a Melody" sound so convincing, not to mention how well they blend with the rest of the original material. In particular, credit is due to the line up and Alex foremost for mastering the pompous nature of "Magic Breeze" composed and originally performed by Robby Valentine since its progressive nature makes it a tough song to cover effectively. Overall "Pieces" is indeed amongst the best melodic rock albums of 2004 which should by all means satisfy even seasoned fans of the genre.

"Vital Signs" is the fifth studio album by American AOR band "Survivor", originally released in 1984. "Vital Signs" proved a landmark in the band's career with the entry of iconic melodic rock singer Jimi Jamison in the line up."Vital Signs" as any of the previous "Survivor" albums is built on strong harmonies (a mixture of Frankie Sullivan's guitars and Jim Peterik's keyboards). However "Vital Signs" brought a new level of performance intensity, largely attributed to Jamison's range and attack. For that matter, most songs on "Vital Signs" feature mid-tempo opening sections while progressively building up in tempo and arrangements; so Jimi's ability as a singer were put to good test on this fifth album, and to his credit delivered AOR classic after classic."I can't hold back, "High on you", "First night", "Popular girl" and the monumental "It's the singer not the song are moments of AOR gold, built on such arrangements that hold their own in contemporary songwriting. I suppose few would disagree that "Vital Signs" is one of the most historically significant releases in adult oriented rock that introduced a different approach for both "Survivor" and the genre as a whole.

"Long Way From Love" is the debut solo album by hard rock/AOR singer Mark Free originally released in 1993 and his last release before his controversial sex change. Having fronted a number of hard rock/glam metal bands such as "King Kobra", "Signal" and "Unruly Child", Mark takes a considerable musical turn with his debut album as "Long way from love" is a strictly AOR album; and while lacking the instrumental attack of his previous works, this debut is filled with powerful performances and strong songwriting while possibly standing as Free's best ever vocal performance.The album is big on AOR rhythms, keyboard parts and impressive lead guitar while the emphasis is clearly on the choruses where Mark's performance is monumental. The list of top AOR moments one is offered here is impressive: "Stranger among us", "The last time", "Hard heart to break", "State of love" and "look love in the eyes" all incredible material with lyrics and melodies so genuine that `itch' the listener to come back and play the album time and time again.One also has to mention that there is no stable line up on this album, in fact the instruments are performed by a large cast of musicians while also having been produced individually."Long way from love" is indeed a highlight in Mark Free's career, although considerably softer, or one could say more mature than his previous works. In addition, a valiant move from the singer's part to release such an album at a time when the popularity of the melodic rock genres were brutally declining. A must for any fan of fiery AOR especially for fans of "King Kobra", "Signal" and "Unruly Child".

"Danziland" is the second solo album by American guitar hero Danny Danzi originally released in 2004 by "MTM Music". Danny Danzy plays melodic hard rock with a clear `80s orientation, bringing to front a full-band line up for the recordings of this debut. The line-up features Andy Slostad on rythm guitar, bassist Wayne Davis, drummer Timmay Lloyd and key-player Phil Buckleman and Danny on lead guitars and vocals.The album opens with the title-track which makes direct reference to Roth-era "Van Halen" followed by the adult oriented rocker "Eternity" and the groovy "Just a matter of time". Then comes the piano-driven ballad "Let it go" followed by the totally hard rocking "Wild & Dangerous", possibly the strongest moment on "Danziland" built on the qualities of late-`80s "Whitesnake".As you would expect "Danziland" is a particularly guitar driven album, as both rhythm and lead guitars establish a firm presence throughout the track-list. Danny uncovers a great deal of his technique in melodic shredding while also putting an admirable performance as lead vocalist. Overall Danzi's second release is a solid work touching upon AOR, melodic hard rock and glam metal-therefore if you are a fan of these genres and guitar-driven rock in general, you should try this album.

As many are aware, "Thunderstone" is a Finnish Heavy metal band formed in 2000. "Tools of Destruction" is their 3rd album recorded in 2005 and a start to finish heavy melodic masterpiece.Now for some "Thunderstone" is considered a power metal band; while others choose to look at them as a thrash metal group which progressively became softer and more commercial. If both statements stood true at different periods in time then this album stands right in the middle. It is definitely melodic with huge choruses but at the same time extra heavy with destructive guitar riffs.Kicking off with the title track, a heavy and slick tune with a literally haunting mid tempo chorus, which is followed by the fast and melancholic "Without wings". Moving on, the album offers more cracking song in "Liquid of the kings" and "The last song"; but "I will come again" is definitely the track that epitomizes this album's majesty as it manages to bond sadness and optimism within a single song (no kidding!).Lead singer Pasi Rantanen puts on a stellar performance while Nino Laurenne's guitar solos and riffs are very considerate, perfectly adding to the atmosphere of each song. But "Tools of destruction" is such a strong and cohesive album that is almost impossible to break down as one can only look at it as a total of 10 amazing tracks with the potential to satisfy the most demanding of Heavy and Power metal.This album, as the rest from this band, were enthusiastically received in Europe, with the title track single reaching number 3 on the Finnish charts.

After the international success of their self titled 1998 debut album, "Primal Fear" entered the studio in 1999 to record their follow up album "Jaws of Death". The existing line up of Ralf Scheepers (v), Mat Sinner (b), Tom Newman (g) and Klaus Sperling (d) are joined in the recordings by touring guitarist Stefan Leibing, becoming a full time member of the band."Jaws of Death" was to be one of the darker, if not the darkest, studio album in the band's course to date, being particularly minor melodic complemented by some of the most dramatic lyrics the groups has come up with. In comparison to the previous album, "Jaws of death" places even higher emphasis on melodies and harmonies that deliver the grim essence of the album. Mid- High pitch vocal attack, furious twin guitar leads, devastating rhythm section and riffs of steel make "Jaws of Death" a dark and heroic album that ultimately does not deliver pessimism rather the struggle and will to survive.Much like their debut, so "Jaws of death" could be considered a classic of the power/heavy metal genre; from timeless compositions such as "Final Embrace", "Play to kill" and "Save a prayer" to the dark band photos in the dungeon-like studio, "Jaws of death" verified that what started with the previous album had every bit the potential to forge a successful career in the coming millennium.

"Devils" is the 7th studio album by Finnish glam metal-goth rock band "the 69 eyes" originally released in 2004. "Devils" is the first of two albums grouped as the "Angels/Devils" saga that would be completed with the release of the studio album "Angels" three years later.One could rightfully consider "Devils" as the ideal mixture of the band's two musical identites; that of a hair metal act during the early 90s and their goth rock style that had dominated their music since the mid 90s. Yes, you could say that this is a 50% glam album and 50% goth album, yet the attentive listener will proably be able to make out that "The 69 eyes" have created a unique rock/metal sound rather than simply mixing half of each genre.As the booklet and cover artwork suggests, "the 69 eyes" have become considerably more extrovert with this album featuiring a good number or rock star-like group photos and undeniable sleaze metal dressing code. It was at that time that the band would also take a conceptual turn (beyond music and image), now portraying a group of vampire sleaze/goth rockers. For that matter the song "Lost boys" perfectly sets the mood for this conceptual swing, with the inspiration building on the classic 80s vampie movie of the same title (as the band were always keen to celebrate movies and iconic actors through their songs). Other standout tracks include the commanding opener "Devils", the melodic "Feel Berlin", the rocking "Nothing on you" and the romantic/macabre "Christina Death".Overall "Devils" is the outcome of a band that has managed to balance perfectly their influences and styles while establishing their own sound. "Devils" took the band into a new direction having reinvented their music, style and concept.

"Cracked wide open and bruised" is the debut album by Swedish sleaze metal band"Babylon Bombs" originally released in 2005. Arguably "Babylon Bombs", built upon the sound of early "Hardcore superstar", taking their sleaze rock and mixing it with rock'n'roll and glam metal.Indeed this debut offering is far form the heavy metal production, instead baring the sound quality of a "Buckcherry" album. Despite the crystal clear mixing and mastering there is a definite vintage sound when it comes to the guitars and drums. It is also important to mention that piano is a key part in the songwriting and performance of "Cracked..." reinforcing the rock'n'roll vibe of the album.The album opens on a string of sleaze rockers in "Let's Roll", "Superstar" and "Lady Deny", followed by the power ballad of the album, the incredibly melodic "Crucify" which is totally indicative of the musical abilities of the quartet, proving more than enough to separate "Babylon Bombs" from the bulk of sleaze rock acts. The booklet plainly credits Dani as the lead singer and guitarist, Jon as the lead guitarist, Mart as bassist and Swaint as the drummer.Despite the sleaze label through which "Babylon Bombs" became known in Europe, Danni's vocal approach which is a mixture classic rock and melodic rock singing is another plus for the band. Overall, "Cracked wide..." effectively promoted "Babylon Bombs" amongst the protagonists in Scandinavian sleaze metal along side "Hardcore Superstar" and "Backyard Babies".

"Evil Masquerade" is a Danish progressive/neoclassical metal band formed in 2003 with their subsequent debut `Welcome to the show' being released in 2004.Time would show that guitarist Henrik Flyman would provide the only consistency in the band's line up through the years to come, still this early version of the band features Henrik Brockmann on lead vocals- best know as the original vocalist of the highly acclaimed progressive metal band "Royal Hunt"; in fact the "Evil Masquerade" debut marks Henrik's return as a recording artist after a decade of silence. The line up is completed by drummer Dennis Buhl and bass player Kasper Gram.In terms of musical direction, the progressive, almost theatrical element found in the singer's previous works perfectly defines this debut. Yet unlike `Royal Hunt', `Evil Masquerade' is built on the basic three-instrument formation: guitar-drums-bass, relying as little as possible on keyboards with practically no symphonic orchestrations. However this very basic approach followed on this album allows for the three instrument to shine in all their flamboyancy: Endless amounts of neoclassic guitar shred, speeding, yet inventive rhythm section and, of course, Brockmann's leading vocal role is as stellar as ever; his ability to pick up any melody with his voice never ceases to impress.So despite the "Royal Hunt" heritage, "Evil Masquerade- Welcome to the show" proves itself as faster, heavier and more aggressive, while it does follow the same lyrical concept as the iconic Danish band. The whole album is a blast, top quality material no matter which song you pick; personal favourites include `Surprise us in the dark', `The wind will rise', `Welcome to the show', `Oh harlequin' and `Children of the light'.Whether you are looking for technical guitar playing, power metal rhythm, or top melodic metal vocals, "Welcome to the show" is the ideal amalgamation of these qualities.

"Rest in sleaze" is the debut album by Swedish sleaze metal band "Crashdiet" originally released in 2005. This debut would arguably become a landmark record for sleaze metal in the new millennium for all the right and wrong reasons. As hinted by the front cover, "Crashdiet" are authentic, unashamedly glamorous, sleaze metalers featuring guitarist Martin Sweet, bassit Pete London, drummer Eric Young and singer Dave Leppard.Most would agree that "Crashdiet" stormed the scene with similar aggression, passion and attitude to American icons "Skid Row" and "Guns `n' roses". Indeed the quart et effectively reinvented the sleaze metal of the 80s into a heavier, thicker and catchier mix that set new standards for the genre (at least regarding the sound of European sleaze metal) .Songs like "Riot in everyone", "Breaking the chainz", are ideal attitude-fuelled anthems, "Queen obscene" is more of a party rocker, while "It's a miracle" provides a potential radio/mainstream hit for "Crashdiet". Beyond the large choruses, the heavy riffs, the guitar melodies and solos, what makes "Rest in sleaze" a classic is the fact that it sounds convincing; the glamorous attitude is real, the sleaze atmosphere is real and the passion in performance undeniable.Despite the domestic chart success of "Rest in sleaze" the album would also become a synonym of tragedy for the band and their fans as Leppard would commit suicide shortly after the launch and success of the debut. "Rest in sleaze" is indeed a modern-day classic for the glam/sleaze genre.

"The black flame" is the 4th studio album by Swedish heavy/power metal band "Wolf" originally released in 2006. Beyond their traditional metal orientation both in terms of production and image, "Wolf" also belong to the Horror metal category. Specifically their lyrical themes center on metaphysical horror, religious horror and serial killer horror, with this latter category probably being the most original songwriting.The line up features lead singer/guitarist Niklas Stalvind, guitarist Johannes Losback bassist Mikael Goding and drummer Tobias Kellgren. While the band could be widely categorized as traditional metal, power metal or horror metal, they do place musical emphasis on instrumental melodies and choruses which are the elements that make the release memorable. The majority of the songs on "The black flame" are indeed heavy, direct and very much to the point-hence a fierce chorus. I have to say that tracks like the opener "I will kill again", "At the graveyard" and "The bite" are songs that you really can't forget once you have heard once and they do have an the intriguing songwriting will definitely draw you back to "The white flame" time and time again.In retrospect "The white flame" was indeed the album that took "Wolf"s career to the next level, effectively shaping them a protagonist in the traditional metal and horror metal genres. If you enjoy darker heavy/power bands like "Powerfolf" and "Bloodbound" or traditional metal bands like "Enforcer" and "Cauldron", "Wolf- the white flame" is a guarantee.

"Loud and Clear" is the third studio album by American glam metal band "Autograph" originally released in 1987; this particular edition is a 2006 re-issue By "Rockcandy" featuring the original 10-track album along with extended 16-page booklet. The line up features lead guitarist Steve Lynch, singer/guitarist Steve Plunkett, drummer Keni Richards, bassist Randy Rand and keyboardist Steven Isham.Much like previous albums, "Autograph" clearly epitomize the radio-oriented side of glam metal and suceed at delivering authentic sounding though somewhat predictable `80s hard rock. Despite the above it is arguable that "Audograph" did establish a sound of their own withing the glam genre; hugely produced drums and copious amounts of guitar tapping leads harmonizing perfectly with the keyboards characterize the sound of the quintet.Still, the more one plays the album the more one gets the impression that "Audograph" have actually induced a good amount of adult oriented rock in the structures of songs like "Everythime I dream", "She never looked that good", "Just got back from heaven" and "More than a million times", cleverly contradicting the extravagant glamour of "Dance the night", "She's a tease" and "Down `n dirty". And that is perhaps the greatest achievement of "Loud and Clear", delivering equal amounts of glam metal and adult oriented rock, all dressed with the thickest production possible; indeed an album that holds its own in the contemporary melodic rock world.

A year past their 2004 debut, `Last Autumn's Dream' were ready to put in the market their second album simply titled `II'. The band had undergone significant line up changes as three of its members left to rejoin their original band, hard rock powerhouse `Europe' in 2005. This left Swedish singer Mikael Erlandsson and German guitarist Andy Malecek in search of a new rhythm section and key player. The rhythm section that would fill the position was non other than `Talisman' members, drummer Jamie Borger and bass virtuoso Marcel Jacob; the new key player was found in Thomas Lassar.It was this line up that cut `II' an AOR album made under the example of their debut, perhaps even a bit softer. What fans of `Talisman' and `Fair waring' should keep in mind is that "LAD" is far from the overblown hard rock/melodic rock rock of the two bands. There are no big guitar riffs, thunderous drums or distorted bass lines, as the group had already made clear with their debut that they would go AOR all the way.Still this second album did not have the instant classics/potential melodic hits of the previous release while one is under the impression are even lower in the mix this time. The powerful choruses have also been replaced by softer ones; finally it seems that the album relies a bit more on groove than on melody. Still as before "II" offers a good number of standout AOR tracks: `Lost in you', `Up in paradise', 'Over and out' and the cover of the `Zeno' track `Heat of emotion'.

This is the debut album by German mega-melodic hard rock band "Fair Warning" originally released in 1992. Released at a time when melodic rock was suffering from consequent drops in sales, this self titled debut album established "Fair Warning" as major force in 90s melodic rock with particular success in Europe and Japan.The line up of Tommy Heart (v), Uwe Ritgen (b), Helge Engelke (g), Andy Malecek (g) and C.C. Behrens (d) seemingly came out of nowhere bringing such passionate performances and technical proficiency, taking the 80s melodic rock sound into a new level that very few bands would manage to reach.Of course "Fair Warning" as a band originated from the mid-80s melodic rock/glam metal outfit "Zeno", led by guitarist Zeno Roth who featured Uwe Ritgen as a full time member and Tommy Heart singing on a number of tracks. Under the example set by Zeno, "Fair Warning" built their sound on robust drumming, thumping bass lines, flamboyant guitar leads and solos and the largest choruses courtesy of Tommy Heart.Songs like "Out on the run", "Hang on" and "One step closer" have since become classics of the melodic rock/AOR genre definitely amongst the most identifiable tunes in "Fair Warnings" two-decade career; while the track list also features previously unreleased "Zeno" songs "Heat of emotion" and "Call of the heart"."Fair Warning" is by any standards a classic of the melodic hard rock/AOR genre and an inescapable must for any fan of the genre, sounding just as fresh and intense as 20 years ago.

"Gaia" is the debut album by Dutch composer/singer/multi-instrumentalist Valensia, originally released in 1993. "Gaia" primarily addressed to the Japanese market and a portion of Europe, could be labeled as pomp adult oriented rock. Through its twelve songs, Valensia goes through a variety of musical styles having keyboards/orchestral arrangements and guitars as the main tools of expression, beyond his unmistakable vocals."Gaia" is pretty diverse and at parts extreme in its arrangements, hence there is no such thing as a straightforward melodic rock song on this debut. The songs go through various twists and turns (changes in key, tempos and scales) while retaining their melodic essence. Having played "Gaia" a good number of times, one has to admire Valensia's songwriting talent, after all he did compose and arrange this debut single-handedly; yet the memorable moments, hence the songs that will keep one coming back to this album are few.The opening track "Tere" a pomp melodic rock opus at its own right, has challenging verses and extensive rocking choruses, making it the highlight of "Gaia" on the spot. The other unmistakable highlight of "Gaia" is the ballad "My heart is in your hands" possibly one of the best AOR moments of the mid-90s, and the album's simplest arrangement.

"Psychofantasy" is the fourth studio album by all-star hard rock project "Phenomena", originally released in 2006. "Psychofantasy" marked the return of "Phenomena" and its founder, guitarist/producer Tom Galley in recording, also marking the musician's collaboration with "Escape music", a partnership which continues to this day.As any all-star release of this kind, "Psychofantasy" is based on the concept of renowned vocalist each delivering one or two songs on the album. The return of `The voice of rock' Glenn Hughes to the project definitely adds value to the effort as the iconic singer's contribution was a big part of the previous albums; other vocalists featured here are Tony Martin, Keith Murrell, Matt Morton, Joy Strachan and Lee Small. Small's contribution in particular is key, having co-written six out of eleven song on "Psychofantasy" while singing on two of them.Comparisons between Small and Hughes are inevitable as the former is directly influenced in technique and style by the latter as evidence on "Psychofantasy" suggests. In terms of musical direction, this fourth installment stand somewhat separated from the melodic rock/AOR of the albums that preceded and succeed it, being essentially riff-based hard rock with less emphasis on melodies than what "Phenomena" is generally known for. Of course the singers involved more than deliver the melodies though it still does not quite fit with their established style.Overall if you are into all star rock projects and have enjoyed the works of the musicians involved you should try "Psychofantasy", in the knowledge that it is not quite the defining "Phenomena" album.

"The Power of the Night" is the debut album by American AOR project "Metropolis", originally released in 1999 by MTM Music. "Metropolis" is a melodic rock duo between heroes of the genre, Peter Fredette and Stan Meissner. Peter handles the lead vocals and bass while Stan contributes the guitars, keyboards and drums. All songs on "The Power of the Night" are written by Meissner, also benefiting by external contributions here and there.Those familiar with Stan's solo works should note that "Metropolis" is a substantially guitar driven album featuring equal amounts of guitars and keyboards- riffs, rhythm parts, melodic lines and harmonious solos are all included here. One simply has to comment on the stellar vocal performance that characterizes entirely "The Power of the night". Peter Fredette is at the top of his game on this one in terms of performance, effectively justifying the decision of having his lead vocals over Meissner's on "Metropolis".Being well over a decade since the release of "Metropolis", one rightfully regards "The Power of the Night" a classic of the Adult oriented rock genre. Songs like "Wild and Blue", "Restless Moon", "Whatever it is", "The best is good enough" and the title track are immense moments of melodic rock that still hold their own in the contemporary scene.

"Dominator" is the 13th studio album by legendary American hard rock/ hair metal band "W.A.S.P." originally released in 2007. "Dominator" was the first album to feature the current line up of "W.A.S.P." including bassist Mike Duda, drummer Mike Dupke, lead guitarist Doug Blair and of course founder singer/guitarist Blackie Lawless."Dominator" could by all means be considered a return to the trademark "W.A.S.P." sound (not that there really was any other.) From the opening notes of "Mercy" something tells you that "Dominator" has the melodies, tempos and choruses to stand up to classic "W.A.S.P." material and what follows more than verifies that point. Following the part-southern hard rock, part-metal "Long Way to go" is the darkly romantic "Take me up", succeeded by the apocalyptic "The Burning Man" and the epic "Heaven's Hung in black" which has developed into something of a contemporary classic for "W.A.S.P." over the past decade. Then there is of course the superbly melodic "Heaven's Blessed" which peaks on melodic guitar lines, devastating drumming and some of the catchiest vocal lines Blackie has ever come up with.Though some would consider the follow up album "Babylon" as somewhat superior to this one, "Babylon" bares everything that made great "W.A.S.P." while sounding as convincing as ever, thanks to the new hot rocking line up; easily amongst their best studio works to date.

"Union Jacks" is the fourth studio album by British-American AOR band "The Babys" originally released in 1980, reissued in 2009 by "Rock Candy Records". With an impressive string of studio albums and considerable chart success in the US and the UK, "The Babys" should rightfully be considered as one of the primary forces of melodic rock during the late `70s, establishing such icons of the genre as lead singer John Waite ("Bad English") , Jonathan Cain ("Journey", "Bad English"), Ricky Phillips ("Bad English", "Styx") along side guitarist Wally Stocker and drummer Tony Brock.In comparison to their previous works, "Union Jacks" is somewhat of a darker album, addressing their established love-themes through a more aggressive/intense approach, bringing to front some really iconic melodic rockers in the process. The album opens on the substantially optimistic "Back on my feet again" in the style of "Survivor"-meets-"Journey"; second is "True love true confession" a punishing power-AOR track with thumping rhythm section and super-intense chorus. Fast-forward to the title track, "Union Jack" is comes close to defining pomp-AOR, a composition that builds itself along the way, bringing to front bigger vocal harmonies and effective keyboard melodies. Then comes "In your eyes", another mighty melodic rocker filled with attack and romanticism and yet another highlight for the album.Overall "Union Jacks" can clearly stand toe to toe with such classic AOR albums as "Survivor"s "Eye of the tiger" and "Journey"s "Frontiers". "Union Jacks" is direct, intense, melodic and memorable, a true AOR gem that holds its own even by contemporary standards.

"Winter in Paradise" is the third album by Swedish-German AOR/melodic rock band "Last Autumn's dream" originally released in 2006. The line up features Mikael Erlandsson on lead vocals and keyboards, guitarist Andy Malecek, bassist extraordinaire Marcel Jacob and drummer Jamie Borger.This third album turned out to be more hard rocking than the previous two, posibily affected by the shift in record label moving from `Frontiers records' to `Escape music'. For that matter the guitars are more protagonistic than ever, with thicker rhythm parts and more melodic lines than before, keyboard presence is slightly reduced, the drums are also brought to front in the mix baring more techincal improvisations than before; finally Jacob's bass is perfectly audible with his trademark distoreted sound. So the overall performance is totally unrestrained in "winter in paradise" as all members are free to explore their personal style without any reserves.Although the melodies and choruses are essentially similar to those of the previous two albums, the flamboyant performance and dynamic production could easily place "Winter in paradice" in the melodic hard rock genre. And despite being heavier, their third album emenates an incredible air of confidence and undisputedly possitive messages to the listener. Favorite track include the infectious oppener "Love to go", the dramatic "Winter in paradise" and the frenetic "All I want is rock'n roll".The album also features the first promo video of "LAD" for the song "I don't want to hurt you" being the only video clip the band has shot to date.

"Ordinary just won't do" is the 4th studio album by Swedish AOR/melodic rock band "Grand Illusion" originally released in 2004. "Grand Illusion" play technical AOR with emphasis on melodic twists and turns on each song effectively making the experience more intriguing and perhaps a bit challenging. A very accomplished group of performers and-most importantly-songwriters, "Grand Illusion" are masters at inducing clever instrumentations to their music without undermining the song-writing or appeal of each song; all the above topped by incredible vocal lines moving from mid-range to high pitched notes, all perfectly accurate in key.So, in essence, one could claim that "Grand Illusion" play AOR/melodic rock with a slight progressive twist which only makes the end result more enjoyable and memorable. The line up features vocalist extraordinaire Peter Sundell, bassist Anders Rydholm, guitarist Ola af Trampe, drummer Christian Sundell and harmony vocalist Per Svensson. The team comes up with some outstanding melodic material on "Ordinary..." like the bombastic AOR ballad "Heaven or Hell", the groovy-melodic "Devil's Advocate" the anthemic "Pull you down", and the potential mega-hit "When you were mine" are definitely material that stand the test of time, perhaps sounding more relevant in 2011 that in the early `00s. For experienced AOR fans who enjoy their melodic rock with a progressive twist, "Grand Illusion-Ordinary just won't do" is an ideal purchase.

"Angels" is the 8th studio album by Finnish Glam/Goth metalers "The 69 eyes" originally released in 2007. The album was conceived as a sequel to the preceding album "Devils" (2004) at which poin the band had mastered both their glam metal and goth rock musical elements of their past in a unique style that balances perfectly the two. The line up is stable as always: Guitarists Timo Timo and Bazie, bassist Archzie, drummer Jussi and lead singer Jurki.While "Devils" established the darker side of their new sound, "Angels" brought to front a brighter version of that style; for that matter the album has a strong rock'n roll essence that actually references their early 90s albums. And one has to also adress the fact that "Angels" is more groove based than melody based while taking into account that it comes out somewhat lighter than its predecessor in terms of production.The overall message is expectedly more positive that the direction of "Devils", yet "Angels" does lack the very attack that made the previous album so catchy and an instant favorite to most fans. That is not to say that the maeterial and particularly the songwriting is lacking on "Angels", simply it requires a few more plays for one to familiarize oneself with the songs. Favorite tracks include "Never say die", "Los Angeles", "In my name" and "Rocker". To conclude "Angels" definitely stands as a quality glam/goth album that solidified the band's personal sound while also completing the saga.

"Aphrodisiac" is the third studio album by British AOR/hard rock band "FM" originally released in 1992. Considered by enthusiast as the pioneer UK group of `80s melodic rock, "FM" was solidly based on the song writing and production of American AOR. The album line up features lead singer/guitarist Steve Overland, lead guitarist Andy Barnett bassist Mery Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp.Riding on the popularity of rock in the late 80's "Aphrodisiac" is a faithful continuation of the style in the 90s. The album demonstrated over the top production featuring gigantic drumming, up front guitars, ever-present keyboards and mega-harmonic vocals. For that matter, while "Aphrodisiac" has many strengths, if one was to point out it greatest achievement then that would definitely be the vocal layers; the blending of lead singing with backing harmonic vocals during the choruses is superb- making songs like "Breath fire", "All or nothing" and "Ain't too proud" a real joy for any melodic rock/AOR fan.Never the less, one has to clarify that "Aphrodisiac" goes through a plethora of 80s rock styles on its twelve songs; the material moves from AOR to hard rock, to glam metal, to bluesy rock while always retaining flamboyance is performance. Although far from an international hit, "Aphrodisiac" has just about every quality of a classic album, even the front cover hints that the album is a trip in the glory of 80s rock; a must for any fan of 80s rock, AOR and glam metal.

"Devil's Ground" is the 5th studio album by German melodic/power metal band "Primal Fear" originally released in 2004. The line up features founding members singer extraordinaire, Ralf Scheepers, bassist Matt Sinner, established guitarist Stefan Leibing, new entry Canadian drummer Randy Black (ex-"Annihilator") while also marking the return of original guitarist Tom Newman."Devil's Ground" was conceived and recorded in the process of pushing the band's creativity into new (to the members) musical territories, a vision that would also be applied on the following two albums "Seven Seals" and "New Religion". Essentially, "Devil's Ground" is the established heavy/melodic style that "Fear" forged during the late 90s featuring razor-sharp riffs, blinding lead guitar, high pitched vocal attack, devastating rhythm section, all under the catchiest melodies and largest choruses' one could ask for. So songs like "Suicide and Mania", "In metal" and "Heart of A brave" are prime demonstration of their sound; still they go a few steps further by introducing the mid tempo-symphonic epic "The healer", one of their lengthiest tunes featuring probably the longest chorus the band has ever written. In addition the lyrical themes shift considerably towards religion and spiritualism delivering some rather agonizing moments on songs like "Suicide and mania" and "Colony 13". "Devil's ground" spawned a new "Primal Fear" hit song, "Metal is forever" and was the first album to be supported by two promo videos for "Metal is forever" and "The healer".Overall "Devil's Ground" stands as another stellar addition to the band's catalogue that took the first step in a course that would later deliver albums like "Seven Seals"(2005) and the monumental "New religion"(2007). A guarnateed purhcase for anyone who enjoyed "New Religion".

After leaving "King Kobra", iconic singer Mark Free joined AOR/melodic rock outfit "Signal" subsequently recording the "Loud & Clear" album, which would since develop into a point of reference for melodic music. Released in 1989, "Signal-Loud & Clear", signifies Mark's departure from glam metal and the heavier rock genres to a subtler-melodic sound.The line up features guitarist Danny Jacob, bassist Eric Scott who also handles keyboards and drummer Jan Uvena along side Mark. Clearly the protagonist on "Loud & Clear" is Mark Free who delivers yet another divine vocal performance. For that matter, the more one plays the album, the more one gets the impression that the compositions of `Signal' mainly serve as vehicle for Free's singing. And the songs live up to the singer's reputation, "Arms of a stranger", "Does it feel like love", "Go" and the protestant "Liar" are class-A AOR tunes."Signal" sounds like the natural predecessor of the singers other projects such as "Unruly child" and "Long way from Love". It has to be addressed that in contrast to some of Mark's other works, `Signal' is not an album to grab the listener and pin them to the wall with its musical quality; instead it will require an attentive listen of the album to fully appreciate the artistic value of "Loud and Clear". Indeed amongst the greatest albums of US AOR.

"Ghosts" is the 13th studio album by German heavy/power metal band "Rage" ,originally released in 1999. Having first blended their brand of metal with the sounds of classic orchestra in 1995, "Ghosts" is the second all-original symphonic metal album in the group's catalogue. In addition "Ghosts" was the first album to feature perhaps the most appraised line up of the band; Founder bassist/vocalist Peavey Wagner is joined by virtuoso guitarist Victor Smolski and well travelled drum innovator Mike Terrana.In retrospect, one comes to realize that "Ghosts" indeed stands the test of time: The song-writing is built on memorable melodies and large harmonic choruses while the contribution of the "Lingua mortis orchestra" is nothing less than substantial. The orchestra for that matter carries core melodies on each song adding its own flavour to the compositions rather than simply complementing the electric instruments. One has to also take intro account that the production qualities of the album are of very high standards. No instrument sounds thin while the group has somehow managed to maintain all the various musical elements to the foreground.Songs like "Wash my sins away", "Back in time", "Love and fear unite" as well as the title track will draw the listener time and time again to this release. In fact, each time one plays the album, one discovers something new whether that is a melody, an improvisation or an underlying backing vocal. Overall, "Ghosts" would be the first in a series of groundbreaking albums that team Wagner-Smolski-Terrana would come to release therefore essential in establishing "Rage" as a major player in metal for the new millennium.

"Against the world" is the fifth studio album by German AOR/melodic rock band "Frontline", originally released in 2002. "Against" the world" features the established line up of guitarist Robert Boebel, bassist Thomas Bauer, drummer Rami Ali and sensational vocalist Stephan Kaemmerer."Against the world" is a faithful continuation of the hugely produced adult oriented rock of "Frontline" where catchy hooks and infectious harmonies are the name of the game. Clearly the band is found once again in top songwriting and performing form. You can expect up-front guitars, thick rhythm section and commanding keyboards all topped by Stefan's trademark vocals (sounding very much like Hugo Valenti and Steve Perry on his softer moments). Once again admirers of the group are treated to such melodic rock magic as "Destiny", "Lightning Eyes", "Change his life" and "I don't know", probably the album' strongest moment featuring a simply unforgettable chorus.What has always been remarkable about "Frontline" is that they come closer to the American melodic rock sound rather than Teutonic hard rock which is a very rare feat for a German band. Almost a decade past its release, "Against the world" does not prove any less appealing or relevant and like most of their catalogue their fifth album stands the test of time.

"Stranger from the past" is the debut solo album by American singer David Glen Eisley, originally released in 2001. Amongst AOR fans Eisely is recognized as the singer of the `80s melodic rock band "Giuffria" having fronted them on their two studio albums, before the outfit re-formed into "House of Lords".Over a decade past the issuing of "Stranger from the past", one finds that the release is still amongst the greatest come-back albums to be issued by `Frontiers Records'. The main reason contributing to the album's appeal is that David revisits the sound that made him popular during the early-mid `80s as opposed to experimenting or trying to sound modern. In fact "Strangers..." features material drawing musically upon both "Giuffria" and "House of Lords". "Sing Brother", "Don't turn away", "Olivia" and "Stranger in love" belong in the first category being keyboard driven, while substantially smoother in terms of productions and arrangements. The rest of the album comes very close to the pomp melodic hard rock sound of "House of Lords" (referring to their post-millenium works); "Run Run Run", "Can't wait forever", "When it's over" along with the title track could have easily found home on a "House of Lords" album.The consistency in style between this solo effort and the two bands is hardly surprising when considering that David reunited with original "Giuffria" members, guitarist Craig Goldy and bassist Chuck Wright who retain the standards of the group in terms of arrangements and performance. David for his part is stellar, as expected, delivering once again forceful, masculine and convincing vocal performances making the compositions all the more climactic. Overall "Strangers of the past" meets the standards of the "Giuffria"/"House of Lords" musical legacy, lacking nowhere in comparison-Indeed a must-have for fans of the bands referenced above.

Released by "Retrospect Records" are the demo recordings of American melodic hard rock band "Defcon". Active during the late'80s-early `90s, "Defcon" played mega-melodic hard rock in the vain of "Icon" and "King Korba". Extensive melodic guitar lines, perfectly sustained vocals, huge rhythm section and flamboyant keyboard harmonies are the craft of "Defcon"s songs.The line up features lead singer Mark Matthews, guitarist Tony Artino, drummer Nick LePar and keyboardist Shawn Zavodney. It has to be addressed that "Defcon" is easily amongst the best releases of the particular label; even though classified as demo recordings, the production is consistently satisfactory while the multiple musical layers utilized make for an enjoyable-and at times overwhelming-listening experience.Realistically, songs like "Time Waits", "What you're hungry for", "Open your heart" and "Slippin' away" are the cream of `80s melodic hard rock/AOR, never forgetting the unsurpassable "Into the night", possibly the album's strongest moment. If you enjoy technical, extra melodic `80s rock then "Defcon" is a satisfaction-guaranteed option. Fans of "Icon", "King Kobra", "Lionsheart" and "Vinnie Vincent's Invasion" should definitely make the most of "Defcon".

"Mystery Eyes" is the third studio album by German melodic rock sensation "Jaded Heart" originally released in 1997. "Mystery Eyes" featured the established line-up of lead singer Michael Bormann, drummer Axel Kruse, bassist Michel Muller and keyboardist Chris Ivo while guitars are performed once again on a session basis by Alex Beyrodt.For many "Mystery Eyes" was the album that established "Jaded Heart" as an international melodic hard rock outfit in the `90s, being also the album that broke the group into the Japanese market. "Mystery Eyes" features superior production qualities in comparison to the previous two albums while it also marked a return to the songwriting style of their debut. Once again "Jaded Heart" went down the mid tempo -yet melodic- rock path emphasizing on melodic guitar lines, supporting keyboard harmonies and infectious choruses.Clearly the AOR atmosphere of "Mystery Eyes" remains unrivaled to this day featuring such classics as "Stop me from Falling", "Walk on a Wire", the opener "Heaven is falling" and the sensational title track."Mystery Eyes" is 100% AOR substance that still holds its own in the contemporary melodic rock scene; any fan of the genre should try this late-90s melodic highlight especially if you enjoy mid-tempo adult oriented rock.

"Silk and Steel" is the second album by American AOR/melodic hard rock band "Giuffria" originally released in 1986. This is a 2010 reissue by "Metal Blade" records featuring one bonus track. "Giuffria" was the outfit of white rock keyboardist Greg Giuffria, an established rock musician since the late 70s as a member of Christian metal band "Angel". His band would later serve as the foundation for the formation of AOR/melodic hard rock super-group "House of Lords". The line up on this second album features guitar wizard Lanny Cordola, bassist David Sikes, drummer Alan Krigger and the amazing vocal talent of David Glen Eisley alongside Greg.Often obscured by their platinum debut album, "Silk and Steel" pushed the creative boundaries of "Giuffria" into a thicker, more arena-rock sound, drawing closer to the sound of early "House of Lords". Still, the AOR atmosphere is never undermined thanks to the stimulating keyboard harmonies and Eisley's vocal performance. "Heartache" is the slow, melody-driven drama with a super infectious chorus, "Lethal lover" is the up-tempo glam metal attack, "Radio" is an equally heavy though substantially happier rocker, and there is of course "Change of Heart". Arguably the album's strongest moment, "Change of Heart" is an AOR masterpiece where the entire band shines though the undeniably protagonist is Eisley whose vocal performance is nothing less than monumental.This reissue also benefits from great stereo sound quality, surprisingly clear and thick for `80s recordings allowing one to play the album even louder without loss in audio fidelity. "Silk and Steel" is easily amongst the greatest works in the "Giuffria-House of Lords" album catalogue while the given reissue stands as the ideal opportunity to obtain a previously out-of-print classic.

This is the second and final solo release by guitarist Roland Grapow before quitting "Helloween" and putting together his own band "Masterplan". Unlike his debut, this release is backed up by hired musicians such as Michael Vescera (V), Barry Sparks (B), Mike Teranna (D) and Ferdy Doenberg (K).It is important to note that this line up of session musicians (with the exception of Doenberg)recorded Yngwie Malmsteen's "The Seventh Sign" which reached #1 on the Japanese charts in 1994 and gained triple platinum status within the same region. So there is evidence of Grapow aiming to reach the same heights. Although multidimensional and full of fresh ideas" Kaleidoscope" leaves the same impression of an average album just like the Seventh Sign did five years before. Definitely good and worth listening to, still nowhere as good as "Helloween's" "Time of the oath" and "Master of the rings".

Re-issued by Rock Candy records is the second album by Canadian melodic rock band "Harlequin", "Love Crimes" originally released in 1980. In synch with the US melodic rock style of the early `80s, "Love Crimes" bares a similar melodic essence to the works of "Survivor" and "Aldo Nova" of the same era. The line up features lead singer George Belanger, guitarist Glen Willows, keyboardist Gary Golden, bassist Ralph James and drummer David Budzak.Of course radio-potent melodic rock was only one side of "Harlequin"s sound. True their name, "Harlequin" induce an undercurrent of theatricality to their sound which, at parts, comes through the vocals and rhythm section on such songs as "Heaven" and "Love on the rocks". For the biggest part, however, "Love Crimes" remains a straightforward no-nonsense melodic rock/AOR offering that could stand toe to toe with "Survivor", "Foreigner" or "Styx". "Love Crimes" features one of the band's greatest hits in "Innocence", the gloriously melodic "It's all over now" and the intense "Can't hold back" are first class melodic rocker that shine even brighter thanks to the re-mastering process.Overall this reissue of the second "Harlequin" album is guaranteed to satisfy fans of the early `80s US melodic rock/AOR scene and those who enjoyed the works of the bands mentioned above. Another solid re-issue!

"Seven Seals" is the 6th studio album by German melodic/power metal masters "Primal Fear", originally released in 2006, marking their last original release for "Nuclear Blast Records". The team has remained unchanged since the preceding album "Devil's Ground" featuring the almost-original line up of vocalist extraordinaire Ralf Scheepers, bassist/vocalist Mat Sinner, the guitar team of Tom Newman and Stefan Leibing and prodigal drummer Randy Black.Musically, "Seven Seals" is "Primal Fear" dressing their melodic/power metal with symphonic arrangements; it is interesting to note that instead of soft pedaling the end result, the orchestral arrangements actually add attack to the overall performance making "Seven Seals" another furious, yet melodic, metal opus.Naturally it comes down to the songwriting which is aligned with such previous albums as "Nuclear Fire" and "Black Sun" combining speeding rhythm section, furious guitar melodies and unforgiving vocal attack by the legendary metal singer. The opening of "Demons and Angels" indicates perfectly the artistic approach followed on "Seven Seals". And it is track after track a melodic/power ride- "Rollercoaster", "Evil Spell", "All for one" and "Question of honor" all timeless pieces for the given genre. Never forgetting that this sixth album also featured remarkable slower tunes like the mid tempo epic "Diabolus" and the mega climactic power-ballad "Seven Seals".In retrospect one regards "Seven Seals" a classic album of the past decade that obliterates any speculation of the band slowing down. "Seven Seals" is "Primal Fear" as artistic and intimidating as they have ever been; and it has not changed since!

"View from the Top" is the 3rd studio album by Swedish AOR group "Grand Illusion", originally released in 2002. "Grand Illusion" play technical melodic rock with emphasis on challenging, yet catchy songwriting integrating high pitched quire vocals, string arrangements, inventive rhythm section and impressive guitar work. The line up on "View from the Top" features charismatic singers Peter Sundell and Per Svensson, drummer Christian Sundell and multi-instrumentalist Anders Rydholm who handles guitars, keyboards and bass.Much like any of the previous or following "Grand Illusions" albums, "View from the top" is an ambitious work in contemporary melodic rock while one clearly gets the notion of the band pushing themselves forward, by all means, in order to deliver a more flamboyant and overwhelming AOR album. Songs like the protestant opener "I refuse", the super-dramatic "Who's it gonna be", the ambiguous "Positively Negative" and the playful "Gotta give it up" really say everything about the sound and standards set by "Grand Illusion".Fans of melodic rock that enjoy the musical challenge of an album breaking the stereotypes of the genre while unmistakably retaining the AOR identity, "View from the top" is an ideal purchase; much like the rest of their catalogue, this third album by "Grand Illusion" stands the test of time and proves just as relevant as it did a decade ago.

Debut album by Canadian melodic rock/AOR composer, guitarist and singer Aldo Nova, originally released in 1982. In many ways the `Aldo Nova' debut was a sign of things to come for the rock music world in the 80s - the mixture of the well established AOR/melodic rock sound of bands like `Journey', `Foreigner' and `Styx' through a harder, more polished and stylish prism was the most significant step in the development of the `Hair metal' genre.Much like Gary Moore, John Sykes and Jeff Paris, Aldo Nova showcases incredible skills in songwriting, singing and guitar playing. One has to admit that it is not very common for musicians to match two of the above criteria, let alone all three. Therefore the album is bound to impress or at least prove itself substantial, even in 2010. The material on offer here, "Fantasy", "Hot Love", "Heart to heart" and "Under the gun" walk the fine line between late 70s AOR/melodic rock and 80s Glam metal. In addition, the album features the much slower tunes "Ball and Chain" and "Can't stop loving you" setting the standards for the glam metal ballad of the 80s which would develop into an inescapable must for any band wishing to dominate the charts at the time.While the album bares the above characteristics of the Glam/Hair metal stle, it also differentiates itself through minor yet significant qualities: Foremost no instrument is overproduced on Nova's debut, therefore one finds no huge drumming or screaming/vibrato filled guitars while the keys are either piano or atmospheric string section.Overall, the Aldo Nova debut could be considered both a melodic rock/AOR and Glam metal album at its own right; and while it proved not to be the most extreme or outrageous of glam metal albums, it is definitely one of the first and most substantial releases of the genre.

From the music, to the name, to the front cover; I feel `No respect' is the definitive sleaze metal album. Despite the fact it came out in '89 (at a time which the genre was fully commoditized) I tend to consider it the definitive sleaze metal album. Lyrically `No Respect' is nowhere as outrageous as Sleaze Metal is credited of being, instead it brings out that dark/kinky romanticism which is extremely uncommon for bands of this genre.The line up of Danny West (g), James Scott (g), Tom Rickard (d), Ashley Mitchell (b) and the iconic, enigmatic but absolutely charismatic Davy Vain on lead vocals.I never doubted the importance of Sleaze metal as a musical genre; still `No respect' convinced me that sleaze is just as artistic, creative and expressive as any other rock/metal subgenre (perhaps even more so). I still can not decide which element exactly makes `No respect' so sensational: Is it Davy's vocal style and playful pronunciation? Is it the underlining but fully audible bass lines? Is it the macho guitar work and stylish rhythmic chops? I suppose it is the combination of all these elements that make `Vain -No respect' so characteristically sleazy yet so very distinct from anything else in the genre. `Vain' is so artistic that it is intriguing; there is such musical depth into `No respect' that you could be playing the album for ages and still not being able to have enough of it (as other reviewers have already claimed).`1000 degrees' is simply the greatest sleaze metal song I have ever heard, from there onwards the opportunistic `Beat the bullet', the self-abusive `No respect', the ambiguous `Secrets', the climactic `Without you' all unequaled musical pieces.`Vain- No respect' became the basis of my fascination with the genre of sleaze metal; after having `studied' the disc I wanted to explore everything about the genre including past and present bands and their respective works. Been exploring ever since!

`Vertigo' is the melodic rock/AOR project built around lead singer Joseph Williams (ex-`Toto') having released this second album in 2006. As is often the case with `Frontiers records' the label is known for complementing its project with top class musicians and `Vertigo-2' is no exception featuring neoclassical guitar extraordinaire/shredder Alex Masi (`Masi'), drum extraordinaire Virgil Donati(`Soul Cirkus') and bass player Fabrizio Grossi (`Los Angeles').Realistically Williams, Donati and Grossi have been involved with melodic rock/AOR works for decades; so what one is really curious to find out is how Masi fares on such a project, being far from his trademark neoclassical metal sound. Truth is, Masi adapts perfectly to the AOR sound while his guitar playing is melodic and inventive (although not as flamboyant as on his solo work).There is an extensive list of songwriters that contributed to the compositions of `Vertigo-2' still the end result manages to sound cohesive although each song is strongly differentiated from the next. Overall the material on `Vertigo-2' lives up to the reputation of this great cast of musicians: `Holy' is the potential AOR radio hit, `Part of me' is the up front melodic rock protest, `Picking up the pieces' is the ideal combination of groove and melody and there is also `All for you' a melodic rocker filled with mainstream quality.Overall a very memorable album `Vertigo 2' is. If you are a fan of `Toto' or `Journey' and have already explored a number of their members' side projects, you should definitely get `Vertigo-2'.

"Metal Machine" is the 4th and latest to date studio album by Swedish melodic metal band "Midnight Sun" originally released in 2001. The album was to feature an all star line-up by today's standards including singer Jacob Samuels ("The Poodles", ex-"Talisman"), guitarist Magnus Karlsson ("Primal Fear", "Starbreaker") drummer Jamie Salazar along with founder bassist Jonas Reingold.Unquestionably "Metal Machine" would come to be the heaviest album this band ever produced, clearly directed towards melodic metal (as the title suggests) rather than hard rock. For that matter the album draws strongly upon `Judas Priest's sound and themes; essentially they attempt to mix their own melodies and instrumentations with tempos and riffs that undeniably bring to mind the great British band.It has to be said that all members have managed to cope admirably with the shift in direction. Jacob Samuels in particular uses high-pitched on a good number of tracks and although far from his characteristic style, he proves effective and convincing. For Magnus Karlsson, as most are aware, there is nothing too difficult to play, so he naturally adapts to the musical direction while his lead guitar parts remain as inventive as ever. Favorite songs include "Temple of the Graal", "Steel to steel", "Metal machine" and "Distorted eyes".Overall "Metalmachine" proved another great addition to the "Midnight Sun" catalogue effectively reinventing the style of the band which would evolve from album to album.

Recorded in 1981, "Dirty Fingers" was meant to be Gary Moore's second solo album in the 80s-yet ended up shelved during the last stages of production as Gary fell out with Jet Records. "Dirty Fingers", commonly regarded the black sheep of Moore's catalogue (by critics and himself), was first released in Japan in 1983 at which point Gary had established a loyal following. Moore was working on Greg Lake's second solo album and tour at the time and did not authorize the release. Following "Dirty Fingers" was released internationally in 1984 while Gary was promoting his latest album "Victims of the future" and expectedly did not endorse the commercial presence of "Dirty Fingers".On a personal level, I do regard "Dirty Fingers" as the ultimate hard rock album and possibly my favorite album ever, but let's stick to the facts: On this album Gary focuses on guitar, having brought in full-time American vocalist Charlie Huhn (ex"Ted Nugent"), drummer extraordinaire Tommy Aldridge, bassist Jimmy Bain and key player Don Airey. Two of the album's features make "Dirty Fingers" one of the greatest albums ever; Huhn's divine vocal performance-uncovering the full extent of his charisma, totally expressive and colorful in his singing while demonstrating the most intense wailing.The other feat is of course Gary's playing; to be fair Gary is extraordinary each and every time, but on "Dirty Fingers" one gets the impression that the virtuoso has surpassed himself. Nothing compares to the opening riffs of "Hiroshima", "Don't let me be misunderstood", "Nuclear attach" and "Lonely nights", furthermore the solos on each track are probably the most accomplished shredding ever captured on tape. By playing the album one can simply not forget the shocking choruses of "Hiroshima", "Nuclear attack" and "Kidnapped".I can go on and on appraising this album, still one could rightfully conclude that Moore's most disregarded album is possibly his greatest work in hard rock in a series of amazing releases.

Lars Eric Mattsson is a Finnish neoclassical guitar shredder within the progressive metal musical field. Discovered during the mid 80s by legendary American producer/editor Mike Varney along with Yngwie Malmsteen and Tony McAlpine, Lars went on to record a considerable number of highly acclaimed neoclassical prog metal albums."Eternity" is his debut album originally released in 1988. What is critical to keep in mind is that this CD release is not the original LP album of the late 80s, rather a rerecorded version put together by Mattsson (guitar, bass, keys), Bjorn Ladin (vocals) and Eddie Sledgehammer (drums). According to Lars, the original recordings were of very low quality which is the reason he decided to recreate the album before this release came out.Having not heard the original recording I can only stand on fantastic songs, such as "Break Your Chains", "Let it Rock", "Where Do we Go" and the decimating love song "Can't go on without your love". This album is blessed with heavy, not to mention, powerful melodies lightning- fast neoclassical solos (much like Y. Malmsteen's, only faster) and the rough but passionate performance of Ladin.Although just as good as Varney's other prospects, Lars never reached the commercial success of Malmsteen or Mc Alpine; Some could say that he wasn't as flashy as the others or possibly lacked that "star quality" (as some would like to refer to). This does not affect the fact that the album in front of you is an undisputed classic often compared to Malmsteen's "Rising Force- Marching Out" and Impellitteri's "Stand in Line".If you enjoy any of the albums, or names mentioned above then you should definitely check out Mattsson and his tremendous debut album "Eternity"Mattsson is also the owner of "Lion Music" records, and takes on the tradition of promoting/signing new talents such as "Emir Hot" and "Thorbjorn Englund".

"Lionsheart" was the early `90s melodic hard rock/glam metal outfit of highly acclaimed British vocalist Steve Grimmett (ex "Grim Reaper") which would become particularly successful in Japan while releasing three studio albums during the period 1993-`98.Under the direction of `Frontiers Records', Grimmett put together a new version of "Lionsheart" in 2004 which subsequently recorded "Abyss". The line up this time features apart from Steve, lead guitarist Ian Nash, bassist Eddie Marsh and drummer Steve Hales. Despite the reformation, "Abyss" retains the characteristics of earlier "Lionsheart" albums such as the thrilling lead guitar parts and technical riffs, thunderous rhythm section as well as the titanic vocal performance of Grimmett. The songs on this album are actually statements: "I'm alive", "All I got", "Screaming", "Save me" and "Nightmare" carry very forceful messages that are further amplified by the powerful/dramatic singing of Steve, added to the fiery performance of his band.I would go as far as saying that this 2004 album is probably superior to the previous two studio efforts of "Lionsheart", being only topped by their classic debut. Perhaps the most overlooked of all albums of this band, "Abyss" is the latest to date studio album from "Lionsheart" as Grimmett would go on to forge a solo career amongst other projects/collaborations. "Abyss" is a must for any fan of up-front melodic hard rock and melodic metal-particularly for those having followed Grimmett's other works namely `Grim Reaper', `Onslaught' and "Grimmstine".

"Fair Warning" was amongst the premiere German melodic hard rock/AOR groups to emerge and forge a stable career during the 90s. Since their recording debut in 1992 the band has released 6 studio albums of highly acclaimed, overblown melodic hard rock with overwhelming success in the Japanese market.Having released their first live video concert "Live in Japan" in 1993 (reissued on DVD in 2006), "Fair Warning" returned to Japan in 2009 and 2010 to capture this latest double live DVD "Talking Ain't Enough". For "Fair Warning" fans, this double DVD will probably make up for the 17 intervening years without an "FW" live video, as it captures two full concerts of the band.The first 2009 concert finds the band performing at the prestigious "Loudpark 09" festival playing overall 13 tracks, while the 2010 concert is filmed on a date during the band's headline tour of Japan where they perform 22 tracks. Now, as you would expect, a good number of songs are repeated between the two concerts, yet the group has effectively chosen the most melodic, upbeat and rocking songs from their catalogue that are certain to please any fan of the melodic hard rock/AOR genre.Moving to the specifics of the show, both concerts are filmed on rather large stages where the six piece band is comfortably placed, with camera angles covering all six musicians. The line up features lead singer Tommy Heart, guitarist extraordinaire Helge Engelke, bassist Ule Ritgen and drummer C.C. Behrens along side session/support members key player Torsten Leuderwaldt ("Dreamtide") and guitarist Henny Wolter ("Primal Fear"/"Sinner"). In terms of performance the band faithfully recreate every song, every melody, every solo matching the standards of their studio performances, effectively living up to their reputation as a top melodic live act. The only technical limitation, if any, is the fact that the DVD is strictly stereo, not offering the option of 5.1. sound. Beyond the audio format that the sound quality is ideal with all instruments balanced perfectly making every minor musical detail perfectly audible."Talking ain't enough" the ideal buy for any fan of melodic hard rock/AOR. If you have purchased the latest DVDs by "Brother Firetribe" or "The Poodles", then this is definitely for you.

Most would agree that "Wig Wam" is amongst the leading Scandinavian hair metal bands having debuted their recording career in 2004, "Wig Wamania" is their second studio album released in 2006. Having represented their home country in the European song contest, "Eurovision" in 2005, the band effetcively boosted their status in the European market which resulted in "...Wamania" benefiting from a more effective distribution in the continent.The band consists of lead singer ge Sten Nilsen, bassist Bernt Jansen, guitarist Trond Holter and drummer ystein Andersen. It has to be said that "Wig Wam" place emphasis on lead vocals and guitar while the rhythm section for its biggest part is mostly supportive. For that matter, Nilsen is a far better lead singer than most would expect his singing is filled with high notes which make the choruses intense and memorable. In addition Holter is an incredibly competeng guitarist who writes everything from huge melodic guitar lines to groovy riffs to shredding solos at enviable speed and precision.In retrospect "...Wamania" turned out to be the most uplifting and melodic albums of the group to date. The party atmosphere on the album is unrivaled referencing anything from early "Bon Jovi" to "Quiet Riot"; for that matter the album has undenibale radio quality as seven, at least, of its songs could have been popular hits. Favorite tracks include "Gonna get you someday", "Rock my ride", "Kill my rock" and "the riddle", still each and every of the songs on offer has a timeless quality and could as well be considered classics of the genre in the years to come.It would also come to be that "Wig Wamania" would be the japanese break through of the band, bringing the band to Japan for a series of sucessful shows that led to the recording of "Wig Wam- live in Tokyo" album.

"Tear the House down" is the second album by American glam metal band "Hericane Alice" originally released in 1990, this particular version is a 2008 reissue by "Wounded Bird Records". The line up features future "Bangalore Choir" members bassist Ian Mayo and drummer Jackie Ramos along with guitarist Danny Gill and lead singer Bruce Naumann."Hericane Alice" bare a similar sound to such late `80s glam metal bands as "Heavens Edge" and "Slaughter"; in particular Naumann sounds very similar to Mark Slaughter, particularly during the more melodic moments on "Tear the house down". For that matter, "Hericane Alice" attempt to balance the outrageousness of up-beat glam metal with melodic hard rock and to a fair extent they succeed. Songs like "Wild Young and Crazy", "Bad to Love", "Tear the house down", "Shake, Shake, Shout" are riff driven glam metal tunes and somewhat predictable at that.On the other hand, the more melodic moments like "Badboy Breakout", "Need a lover", "Too Late" and the dramatic power-ballad "I walk alone" prove far superior to the rest of the material on "Tear the house down" bringing to front memorable choruses, clever instrumentations and brilliant lead guitar work by Danny Gill.This particular re-issue features the original 10-track album without any extras or liner notes, while there is also no evidence of the album being re-mastered from the original CD version. Overall, "Tear Down the House" is a quality glam metal album which should appeal to fans of "Slaughter", "Heaven's Edge", "Vinnie Vincent's Invasion" and "Bangalore Choir".

Perhaps the most controversial album of the "Survivor" family of artists, "Empires" is commonly regarded as the 1999 solo album by iconic singer Jimi Jamison. "Empires" was marketed at a time when "Survivor" were inactive, and proved in many ways similar to their original style while also baring striking differences.Songwriting-wise you get the same craft of guitar-keyboard driven AOR/ melodic rock with emphasis on catchy choruses. For that matter songs like "Cry tough", "First day of love", "Have mercy" and "Calling America" are just as infectious as "Survivor"s chart hits, clearly matching the standards of landmark albums as "Vital Signs" and "Too hot to Sleep" (never forgetting the inclusion of the "Baywatch" series hit "I'm always here"). Jimi Jamison is once again on top form, adding the same feeling and artistc charisma on each of the songs on offer.On the other hand "Empires" production is fundamentally different to the original sound, featuring thick guitar riffs and equally fat bass which never the less makes "Empires" sound all the more contemporary. In retrospect "Empires" turned out to be one of the heavier rocking albums in Jamison's catalogue featuring no shortage of standout tunes; with a total of fourteen songs on offer this is easily his most complete album to date.

"The uncrowned" is the third album by melodic metal band "Last Tribe", the brain child of guitarist Magnus Karlsson, originally released in 2004; the album features the established line-up of singer Rickard Bengtsson, bassist Dick Lovgren and drummer Jamie Salazar."The uncrowned" benefits from the best production to be found on a "Last Tribe" album with thicker guitars, clearest rhythm section and vocals, all mixed ideally. Upon first play it becomes clear that there is even greater emphasis on melodic lines, particularly on the subject of guitars as Magnus introduces an even more harmonic/melodic style of playing inducing melodies on the opening riffs, choruses and solos. In addition the rhythm section has become considerably more flamboyant adding more improvisations and a larger variety of grooves and tempos to the compositions. Finally Rickard has also matured as a singer, now adding multiple layers of vocal performances establishing himself as a world-class singer on "The Uncrowned".By playing the album over and over, one becomes convinced it was at this point that Magnus reached the stellar song-writing level that he is recognized for today on projects like "Allen-Lande", "Kiske-Somerville" and "Starbreaker". For that matter just about any song on "The uncrowned" could have easily served as material for an "Allen-Lande" album; every track on this album is literally a standout. "The Uncrowned" is my personal favourite out of the three "Last Tribe" albums, capable of standing toe to toe with the guitarist's latest, most popular works. A definite must for fans of the bands/projects mentioned above.

"Unity" is the 15th studio album by German heavy/power metal outfit "Rage" originally released in 2002. Along with its follow up album "Soundhcaser", "Unity" is considered the greatest moment of the particular line up featuring founder bassist/vocalist Peavey Wagner, guitar hero Victor Smolski and drummer extraordinaire Mike Terrana.The album moves along the heavy-meets-melodic route, a style that has consistently characterized the works of the band in the new millennium; you can expect thick riffs, inventive drumming, unconventional lead guitar parts and rough yet melodic vocals. "Rage"s ability of combining heavy riffs with the catchiest hooks and melodic lines is unequalled; for that matter "Down", "All I want" and "Set this world on fire" have choruses that stick with the listener upon first play and are bound to be played over and over. By this point the song-writing partnership, that would define "Rage" to present, had been established: Victor is largely in charge of the music particularly in terms of arrangements while Peavy puts together the lyrics and this is indeed the recipe for success as "Unity" very much proves.Overall "Unity" is rightfully regarded as being amongst the greatest works of "Rage" especially considering that at that point they had over a dozen albums in their catalogue; never the less they did come up with a fresh and exciting album where the trio seems to swing effortlessly through the various twists and turns of these eleven tracks.

"New era" is the debut album by "Revolution Renaissance" the solo project of Finnish guitarist Timo Tolkki originally released in 2008. "New era" signifies the departure of the acclaimed guitarist from power-metal stars "Stratovarius" and him exploring various artistic roots in the rock/metal genres. In fact one could claim that `New era" picks up exactly where Timmo's last work with "Stratovarius" left off.Beyond the established power metal that one has come to expect from the guitarist, the album draws strongly towards melodic hard rock. "New era" features apart from Tolkki, bassist Pasi Heikkila, drummer Mirka Rantanen, key player Joonas Puolakka while lead vocals duties are divided between Michael Kiske, Tobias Sammet and Pasi Rantanen; so the album is quite the all-star project at its own right. The singers are given room to shine throughout the album and in particular Kiske who expectedly handles the melodic rock material. Favorite tracks include "We are magic", "Last night on earth", the sarcastic "Glorious and divine", never forgetting "I did it my way" which has the potential of a chart/radio hit."Revolution Renaissance-New era" is a solid effort by the inventive Finnish guitarist that manages to keep the creative bar high and surround himself with equally renowned personalities of the European power metal scene. A great purchase for fans of "Avantasia", "Sonata Arctica" and "Place Vendome" while baring in mind that "New era" is equally a hard rock album as it is a power metal album.

"Hidden in plain sight" is the debut album by `Craig Goldy's Ritual' originally released in 1991. Having risen to fame as the guitarist of melodic rock band "Giuffria" and heavy metal legend "Dio", Craig Goldy put forward his solo outfit with "Hidden in Plain Sight".Fronting the line up is none other than "Giuffria" lead singer David Glen Eisley. With Goldy and Eisley reuniting one could not expect anything other than a melodic hard rock album in the style of "Giuffria" and "House of Lords". And that is exactly what the `Ritual' delivers-an album that has the harmonic quality and voice to reference directly `Giuffria' while also demonstrating the musical twists and turns that defined the style of "House of Lords". Beyond Eisley's contribution an additional element bringing `Ritual's sound closer to the bands mentioned above is the keyboard performance of Doug Allen adding substantial themes and harmonies (as opposed to simply complementing song-structures).Overall "Hidden in plai sight" features a fair amount of memorable songs such as "Eye for an Eye", "Hard Times comin", "Over and Over" and "Forever More" most of which could have served as material for a "Giuffria"/"House of Lords" album. If you are a fan of the bands mentioned above, Craig Goldy's Ritual is more than recommended.

"Trading Souls" is the second studio album by melodic hard rock project "Empire" originally released in 2003, reissued in 2012 by "Lion Music". "Empire" was one of the musical vehicles for German songwriter/guitar hero Rolf Munkes who beyond his technical skills, seemed to draw the attention of many better known musicians.The line up of "Trading Souls" features such rock legends as bassist Neil Murray ("Whitesnake", "Black Sabbath"), keyboardist Don Airey (Ozzy, "Deep Purple") and vocal titan Tony Martin ("Black Sabbath") alongside Rolf Munkes and drummer Gerald Kloos."Empire" is first and foremost a songwriting-driven album emphasizing on infectious guitar harmonies and irresistible vocal melodies. Songs like "One in a Million", "Perfect Singularity", "Wherever you go" and "Pay Back time" perfectly justify why these rock legends were eager to participate in this project. It has to be addressed that "Trading souls" is far from an over-produced album, in fact, by contemporary production standards you could label it as minimalistic; particularly when considering the rather thin drum sound. The 2012 re-issue has clearly refined the album as far as mastering is concerned without of course altering its light-weight essence. Overall almost a decade past its release, "Trading Souls" should rightfully be considered a classic album of the genre where the founders of the genre meet the talented newcomer.

"Living in the light is the debut solo album by AOR/melodic rock guitarist Josh Ramos (ex "The Storm", "Two Fires", "Hardline") originally released in 2003 by Frontiers records. Much like the previous "Frontiers" projects Ramos has been a part of, "Living in the light" is substantially guitar driven AOR album often overwhelming the listener; you can expect up-front, harmonious riffs, extensive lead guitar work, complementary keyboards (mostly piano) and the incredible vocals of Mark Weitz.With the exception of a single song, the entire album is written or co-written by Josh Ramos which is a rare feat for a Frontiers release as most works of the label rely heavily upon external songwriters. Therefore all credit due to Josh for putting together and performing on another great album including such highlights as the title track, the mega-melodic ballad "You're so far away", the optimistic "Seize the day" and the rocking "Take it or leave it".One has to note that guitarists as proficient in the melodic genre as Ramos do not come by as often, which makes his works all the more significant for the genre.If you enjoy guitar-drive melodic rock/AOR you should definitely check out Josh's other works including "Robert Fleischman-World in you eyes", "Ramos-Hugo" and "Hardline-leaving the end open".

This is the self titled debut album by AOR/melodic rock singer-keyboardist Robby Valentine. Having left his original glam metal/melodic hard rock outfit "Zinatra", Robby put forward his solo career in 1992.The "Robby Valentine" debut would effectively establish Robby's unique brand of adult oriented rock which is often characterized as technical melodic rock or progressive AOR. In fact, most songs on this 1992 release could be regarded both as songs and musical pieces. It is more than obvious that the singer did not lack musical vision or inspiration when putting together his solo debut.Valentine opens on the ambitious "The magic breeze", a landmark in orchestral adult oriented rock, totally indicative of the songwriter's musical ability and artistic orientation. "One day" is the optimistic-perhaps sweet sugary- melodic tune still every bit a classic. There is of course the "Queen"-esque "The Gift of life". Form there onwards you get the dramatic "Heaven is calling", the potential mega-hit "Broken Dreams", the subtle ballad "Over and over again" and the stimulating "Heaven is calling" all timeless artistic material.A great part of the album's appeal is to be attributed to the fact that all instruments shine on each and every instrument, with guitars, bass and drums being crucial elements to the end result (even though the overall songwriting is based on keyboards). No disputing the fact that Robby Valentine is every bit the melodic rock classic, an album that deserves a reissue more than anything.

This is a 2011 reissue of "When Seconds Count" by AOR legends "Survivor", originally released in 1986. "When Seconds Count" was survivor's 6th studio album and the second featuring Jimi Jamison fronting the group. Jimi joins the established line up of guitarist Frankie Sullivan, keyboardist Jim Peterik, bassist Stephan Ellis and drummer Marc Drouba.Music-wise "When seconds count" was the ideal continuation of the preceding album "Vital Signs", further exploring their keyboard/vocal driven sound, delivering immense harmonies (in both instrumental and vocal departments). "When seconds count" features such highlights as "Rebel Son", the predictable but undeniably melodic "Is this love" and the majestic "Oceans". One finds that in terms of both songwriting and performance, "Survivor" chose to challenge themselves by adding various musical twists and turns within the arrangements (whether that is an improvisation, a momentary alteration in tempo or a pause) making the end result all the more interesting and memorable.This particular reissue by "Rock Candy" records features the band's 1985 hit single "Burning Heart" (an international hit featured on the 1985 blockbuster Rocky IV) as a bonus since the track was originally available as a single, not included on any of their studio albums. Indeed "When seconds count" is a very well rounded re-issue of a classic American AOR album.

This is the self titled album by American AOR/melodic project "101 South" originally released in 2000 by MTM Music. "101 South" is the brain child of former "Harlan Cage" members, guitarist Michael Turner and vocalist Roger Scott Craig who performs keyboards and backing vocals on "101 South". The project is fronted by incredible vocalist Gregory Lynn Hall, also featuring session musicians Chris Julian (bass) and Hans Geiger (drums).The "101 South" debut is a grandiose adult oriented rock offering which clearly prioritizes outstanding songwriting and intimidating vocal performances above all else. Clearly one is looking at a keyboard-driven album, featuring complementary rhythm guitars and few solo spots.AOR enthusiasts would probably be pleased to know that "101 South" is full of climatic melodic rock performances featuring immense verses and intimidating choruses. Clearly playing "101 South" loud will bring chills on one's spine, such is the melodic force of songs like "We took the wrong road", "Nowhere to run" and the masterpiece that is "Your Razor is Sharp". Performance intensity peaks throughout this album, allowing some room to rest here and there, only to resume with another epic AOR performance. If you are a fan of Adult oriented rock, you simply can not go wrong with "101 South", a musical experience at its own right.

N.W.O.B.H.M. pioneers Diamond Head are captured live on this 2000 release. However, the actual recording is taken from a 1991 show at Wolverhampton UK. At that point original members Sean Harris (V) and Brian Tatler (G) had reunited with plans to record a new album ("Death and Progress"- 1993)."Live in the heat of the night" sound very much like a bootleg release taken straight from the mixing desk lacking any signs of professional mixing and mastering; Having said that all instruments come through clearly and are consistently audible. This release also includes a video CD with 9 out of 13 songs (which CD1 features) also poorly captured by a solo camera.However this album deserves at least 2 to 3 stars due to performances. 9 years past their break up and Harris sounds even greater a vocalist than in the 80s while Tatler has matured into a more confident guitar player unafraid to include tricky passages and solos that match perfectly the nature of the songs. Additionally the CD does not fail to include quite a few of their signature songs namely "In the heat of the night" , "Borrowed Time" and "Lightning to the nations" with the addition of newer minor hits such as "I can't help myself" and "Run".

"Double Medication" Tuesday is the second studio album by British-American melodic rock band "Harlan Cage" originally released in 1998 by MTM music. "Harlan Cage" was the brain-child of keyboardist Roger Scott Craig joined by vocalist/guitarist L.A. Greene, guitarist Billy Liesegang, bassist Jamie Carter and drummer Michael Lawrence.Harlan Cage play keyboard-guitar driven melodic rock/AOR with a fair amount of pomp induced in the arrangements/performances. Interestingly enough the keyboards add the basic harmonies on each song topped by the guitars which perform the melodic themes. So clearly, along with the vocals, there are three leading instruments that put together the sound of "Harlan Cage" which makes for more intense performances and memorable tracks.One has to address that most songs on "Double Medication Tuesday" turn out to be fairly dramatic stories complemented instrumentally by minor melodies. Though direct and totally infectious, the second "Harlan Cage" album is far from an optimistic concept. Songs like "Halfway Home", "My Mama Said", "Defend this heart of mine", "As you Are" and "Turn up the radio" stand as perfect validation of the artistic class of "Harlan Cage". Of course, the experienced listener will be able to tell that the particular release is a late-90s album production-wise as the original CD might sound a tad thin, lacing the low/bass end. If you enjoy dramatic melodic rock with interesting twists and turns, indeed try "Double Medication Tuesday".

Along with "Empire", "Razorback" is the band/project of German guitarist Rolf Munkes. Although set up as a personal project, Empire includes an all star line up: Stephen Berggren ("Snakes in Paradise", ex-"Company of Snakes") on vocals, drummer Andre Hilgers ("Silent Force", "Rage") and Munkes on guitar; the line up is completed by bass player Marcus Bielenberg and second guitarist Chris Heun.Originally released in 2005, this album is a unique combination of mid tempo metal with a hint of AOR. Razorback offers masterpiece hymns such as "Ain't a perfect day" and "Criminal Justice" while "Big city jungle" could as well have become a radio hit, given the opportunity.Overall this is a very original album that deserves one's attention. Usually up tempo songs are the ones that get most of the credit in the rock/metal circle, yet in this case the smooth pace of the album gives the listener the chance to appreciate Munkes's fat, satisfactory guitar sound and Berggren's depth of voice.

Fourth post-reunion album by German melodic/power metal band "Domain" originally released in 2005. The band is led by guitar hero Axel `Ironfinger' Ritt and fronted by singer Carsten Schulz ("Evidence One"); the line up also features bassist Jochen Mayer, drummer Steffan Kolner and key player Erdmann Lange."Domain" is equally a melodic metal band as it is a power metal band, which suggest that melody is never sacrificed in favour of speed; and this ability of balancing the two aspects of their music makes for a hugely appealing sound extending beyond the boundaries of Power metal. On that count `Last days of Utopia' is probably their most diverse album demonstrating a variety of tempos and different levels of heaviness/aggression.Equally important is the fact that the sound of "Domain" is not simply a guitar/drum affair instead the keyboards carry a huge amount of orchestrations and bold melodies while the bass plays an equally important role, underlining the more intense parts of each song; Never neglecting the contribution of lead singer Carsten who puts the soul into each song.Looking into particular songs, `Ocean paradise' is probably the most representative of the album (amongst the best they have ever written) that moves through various twists to reach an explosive chorus. Next you get `The beauty of love' which despite the obvious title is an immense ballad so good that breaks any a power metal stereotype, plus the guitar frenzy of the title track which brings the album back on the power metal track.Finally, a really good melodic/power metal album and one of the best "Domain" have released; If you are a fan of melodic/power, you will find great depth in `The last days of Utopia'.

"Northern Twilight Symphony" is the second and latest to date studio album by Finnish neoclassical metal band "Virtuocity". "Virtuocity" is led by guitar prodigy Jaron Sebastian Raven (ex-"Kenziner"), an authority in neoclassical shredding at his own right, also featuring lead singer James Goodman.In comparison to the previous album, "Northern Twilight Symphony" features orchestral arrangements throughout playing mostly a complementary role to the leads and melodies of the guitar, and being very effective at that. It has to be said that "...Symphony" is amongst the most harmonious albums one could come across in the neoclassical metal genre: Indeed it is full of guitar parts, speeding rhythm section yet the bonding of the orchestral parts with the electric instruments takes away the aggressive edge of the performances.Although melodies and arrangements tend to be repeated amongst the 13 songs on "...Symphony" the do feature distinct choruses that one can not forget. Songs like "Forever young", "Moonlight shadows", "Winter nights" and the unsurpassable "Within my heart" are indicative examples of the quality of "Northern Twilight Symphony". "Northern Twilight Symphony" is indeed an amazing neoclassical metal journey delivering atmosphere, technique and passion all of which make it one of the greatest releases of the genre. The compositions could easily serve for a musical play effectively proving that there is more ground to break into neoclassical metal.

"The power and the myth" is the 4th studio album by American arena rock/AOR group "House of lords" originally released in 2004, marking the return of the band after a twelve year absence. "The power and the myth" marks the re-formation of the original `House of lords' line up, featuring lead singer James Christian, guitarist Lanny Cordola, bassist Chuck Wright, drummer Ken Mary while baring the absence of founder-keyboardist Gregg Giuffria whose duties are fulfilled by Derek Sherinian.In terms of direction "The power and the myth" is largely built on oriental melodies and grooves, for that matter drawing considerably towards progressive rock. One has to comment that this concept is not new to the ranks of "House of lords" as their second album "Sahara" was the fist to integrate eastern elements to their style. Yet "The power..." could be found lacking the AOR atmosphere that defined all their previous works; of course exceptions are to be found in "Bitter sweet euphoria" and "The man who I am". Never the less, the album would have benefited from the inclusion of a few up-tempo potential singles in the style of their classic hits "I wanna be loved" and "remember my name".Though far from a bad album, "The power and the myth" does not quite connect with the band's artistic direction followed before or since its release as the band would go on to release superior studio efforts in the following years under a new line-up with James Christian at the helm.

Europe live in Sweden weeks before their international breakthrough. Here one witnesses a very tight band and a first rate performance. Joey Tempest is technically impeccable throughout the show and John Norum plays twice as fast, not to mention fluently.However, the real advantage this movie has over most other vintage live videos is its perfect mastering: The picture quality is almost reaching today's standards and the 5.1 mix is very good actually. This is probably the best vintage DVD release for 2007. If you like this kind of releases you might want to check also "Twisted Sister- The video years" and "Ratt- Videos from the cellar".

"LA Attraction" is the fifth studio album by US-based project "AOR", originally released in 2006 by "MTM Music". "AOR" is the brain child of French songwriter/guitarist Frederic Slama, exploring the musical fields of adult oriented rock and melodic rock. Much like the previous "AOR" albums as well as the ones that followed, "LA Attraction", is an all-star project featuring such authorities of the genre as Steve Lukather, Peter Friestedt, Tommy Denander, David Williams and Philip Brdowell amongst others.Musically "AOR" is positioned right in the middle between melodic rock and westcoast AOR combining the intensity of the former (guitars and vocals) with the subtlety of the latter (keyboards and rhythm section). "LA Attraction" is a fairly straightforward album that moves within the traditional-stereotypical by some-AOR forms. Though the songwriting is directly influenced by melodic rock radio highlights of the `80s, the overall songwriting structure is pretty conventional without any pompous moments.Having said the above, one has to recognize that "AOR" is one of the few contemporary melodic rock projects that can balance perfectly melody and groove (in very similar fashion to "Toto"). So beyond the well-expected guitar keyboard melodies you will definitely find some very interesting groovy-jazzy patterns which-if nothing else- make for very interesting guitar solos and various harmonies. If you enjoy the combination of melodic rock and west-coast AOR with substantial radio appeal then LA attraction should make for a worthwhile purchase.

In the early years of this closing decade, the up and coming Greek -American band "Firewind" were making forceful claims in the international metal community with power metal classics such as "Between heaven & hell" (2002) and "Burning Earth" (2003). It was also in 2002 that the current "Firewind" lead singer Apollo Papathanasio cut this neoclassical metal album with Swedish band "Meduza" on the very same label ("Massacre Records") that released the two "Firewind" albums mentioned above.This band is led by guitarist and central composer Stefan Berg, also including bassist Jonas Edstrom, Ola Gronlund on drums and Jan Larsson on keyboards. "Now and forever" is a solid slice of neoclassical metal and while it does not match perfectly the style of Firewind, it does include speeding double bass drums and thick-satisfactory production.I have to say that playing the record any number of time will definitely bring to mind the earlier works of Yngwie Malmsteen/"Rising Force" as the release borrows a fair share of rhythm patterns and melodies from the guitar legend. Still this does not make "Meduza" any less enjoyable; in fact every song on this album is up to standards demonstrating surprising consistency in terms of compositions and performance. Literally every characteristic you expect to hear from a neoclassical metal album is definitely here; and most importantly Apollo puts on as accomplished a performance as is his contribution in the latest "Firewind" albums. ("Premonition", "Allegiance")Favorite tracks include "I will rise", "Touch the Sky" and "Burn in Hell". This a top quality release for any fan of neoclassical metal. If you are a fan "Firewind" you can invest safely on "Meduza"; put simply this is more of the same great stuff.

"IV" is the reunion album of hard rock/glam metal band "Winger" originally released in 2006. "IV" brings together the established 80s line up of the band, featuring founder Kip Winger (ex-Alice Cooper) on lead vocals and bass, guitarist extraordinaire Reb Beach ("Whitesnake", ex-"Dokken"), guitarist John Roth ("Giant") and drummer Rod Morgenstein.As most are aware, "Winger" reached multi platinum status during the late 80s-early 90s on the strength of their three studio albums released at the time, now considered landmarks of the glam/party metal genre. "IV", however takes a considerable turn from "Winger"s characteristic glam metal sound to a more pomp hard rock style. The catchy vocal melodies, dynamic rhythm section and flamboyant lead guitar work are still present, yet the songwriting follows a different path. For that matter, Kip and the team have added more instrumental twists and turns on these songs resulting in such compositions like the futuristic "Generica" and battle-song "M16". As these titles suggest "Winger" have gone way beyond their youthful-romantic and fun-time subjects to contemporary socio-political issues and science fiction. Having said that,, "IV" still offers a fair share of direct hard rockers like "Four leaf clover" "Your great escape" and "Short flight to Mexico".Perhaps a surprising release, "Winger-IV" effectively pushed the creative boundaries of the band in 2006 establishing the reformed "Winger" as a fan more diverse musical entity that what were known for in the past.

"Tatooed heart" is the second studio album by German melodic hard rock band "Evidence one" originally released in 2004. At the time "Frontline" members, guitarist Robert Boebel, drummer Rami Ali and bassist Thomas Bauer would regroup with lead singer Carsten Schulz ("Domain", "Midnite Club") and guitarist Wolfgang Schimmer.2004 also sat the release of the 7th "Frontline" studio album, therefore one could reasonably question how focused was this second studio effort by "Evidence one". Truth is that "Tatooed heart" is an incredible melodic hard rock album with a metalic flavor to it. As everything carying the siganture of Robert Boebel, the album benefits from incredibly thick and polished production; from there onwards the melodies come in plenty, the solos are more extensive while Carsten's vocal performance is technically impeccable and passionate as always. Favortie tracks include "Virus in my veins", "written in blood", "When thunder hits the ground" and "Tattooed heart".The overall sound of the album could easily be characterized as arena hard rock, simply because everything on "Tatooed heart" sounds immense. One could use the term overproduced on the album, still a hard rock fan would rarely complain for a band's devastating drum sound or plethora of melodic guitar lines. If you enjoy melodic hard rock produced to the maximum, filled with decimating choruses, titanic rhythm section and endless melodic attack you should definitely get "Evidence one-Tattoed heart" as well as trying Boebel's other bands namely "Frontline", "State of rock" and "Sanction X".

"Forever Endeavour" is the debut solo album by Swedish singer/guitarist Andreas Novak originally released in 2005. Those exploring the Swedish rock/metal scene would probably recognize Novak as the front man of progressive metal bands "Mind's eye" which makes the musical direction of "Forever Endeavour" rather unexpected as the album is AOR-melodic rock from start to finish.And for that matter "Forever...' is a high quality album with Novak coming out a much more experienced melodic rocker than one would expect. One could claim that the contribution of `Mind's eye' drummer/composer Daniel Flores was instrumental for the overall recording to sound so accomplished in both songwriting and production. It would be fair to say that Flores is an equally established musician in both metal and AOR having formed such melodic rock projects as "Faro", "Crash the system" and "The murder of my Sweet"; therefore his contribution on this album as a drummer, songwriter and producer should stand as a guarantee for the quality of "Forever Endeavour".The album also holds a potential hit by the duet "Another woman" featuring the hot(vocally and physically) Martina Edoff which is an unexpected standout for the album. In addition the album has its fair share of orchestral, keyboard dressings which in particular make the album's slower moments even more climactic. Favorite tracks include the title track, "How does it feel", "Another woman" and "By your side". Overall a quality AOR, melodic rock album by Andreas Novak and Daniel Flores proving itself much more memorable than one would expect, with surprising focus in terms of musical direction and accomplished performances.

"Desert Land" is the third album by Christian neoclassical metal band "Narnia" originally released in 2001. The Swedish group was amongst the first to combine neoclassical metal with Christian rock. Essentially one is looking at heavy neoclassical metal that draws on "YJM Rising Force", and "Ring of fire", only with brighter vocal melodies and rather protestant lyrics.The band is built around lead singer Christian Liljegren (later of "Golden Resurrection") and guitarist C. J. Grimmark who would become better known as the guitarist of Rob Rock. The line up is completed by drummer Andreas Johansson, bassist Jakob Persson and key player Martin Claesson. The album demonstrates a variety of tempos with songs ranging from up-tempo to mid-tempo to ballad; in addition, beyond the neoclassical element, "Desert Land" has a rather progressive essence, due to the various instrumentations and alternating rhythm patterns that are found on most songs.As hinted above, the main protagonists on the album are Christian, naturally being the singer and C.J. whose guitar provides the riffs, melodies and very accomplished solos. The guy's technical ability in neoclassical metal is undeniable, fluently going through an extensive set of neoclassic scales and themes on "Desert land". Favourite songs include "Angels are crying" "Walking the wire" and "Inner Sanctum". For fans of "Rob Rock", "Driver", "Impellitteri" and "Rising Force", this is a great addition to one's collection.

Following the release of his solo album "Stranger from the past"(2001), David Glen Eisley and `Frontiers Records' put out "The Lost tapes" a collection of unreleased material by "Giuffria" and "Dirty white boy". Although captured during the mid-late `80s, the quality of these recordings is rather impressive being far above demo quality. In fact, one gets the impression that most tracks on "The Lost tapes" were actually the finalized versions of songs to be included on the third "Giuffria" album (which never saw the light of day).On account of these recording one can easily make out that the third "Giuffria' album would have been very similar to the pomp melodic hard rock of "House of Lords" as they retain the big choruses and keyboard melodies of the original band while placing increased emphasis on the guitar attack and up-front drumming. Songs like "Stand up", "Are you ready", "Shot down in love", and "Don't turn away from love" are totally indicative of "Giuffria"s direction, being substantial melodic hard rockers that had to become available to the fans.In addition "The Lost tapes" feature two songs that were included on the "House of Lords" debut. "Slip of the Tongue" and "Pleasure palace" are featured on this release in their earlier versions- "Slip of the tongue", one has to agree, works just as well with David's vocals, yet the take on "Pleasure Palace" is not as convincing vocally, sounding more like a rough-take or rehearsal from Eisley's part. And with that exception, it has to be acknowledged that the singer's performance on this collection is nothing less than stellar, much like any other album (band or solo) he has been a part of.Overall, "The Lost tapes" is a great documentation of the chronological period intervening between the last "Giuffria" record and the formation of "House of Lords"- while also delivering more material featuring the vocal powerhouse that is David Glen Eisley.

Ole Evenrude is a well known Swedish producer in the field of hard rock/poser rock/glam metal; having produced works of `Stage dolls', 'Wig Wam' `Swedish erotica' and `Bai Bang'.This release is a 2005 reissue of Ole's final solo album `One size fits all' originally released in 1989. Up until that time Ole was aiming at a solo career as a lead singer/front man. Lets get this out of the way, `One size fits all' is an impeccable hard rock/glam metal album whose production, performance and songwriting are very much valid even by today's standards.The musical direction borrows elements from the late 80s-early 90s works of Alice Cooper while the lyrical themes are based on the rebellious messages of early `Skid Row'; Ole's vocal approach stands somewhere between poser vocals and AOR singing.A very pleasant addition to the line up is the contribution of lead guitarist Trond Holter (`Wig Wam') whose performance on this is easily comparable to his current works. The line up is completed by drummer Ole Petter Hansen and key player Tom Jensen. Hence, big drums, shredding guitars, big choruses and loads of memorable melodic lines.MTM classix has done quite a good job with this reissue; apart from the 10 track full length album they add 4 extra songs (all four are standouts and perhaps slightly more aggressive than the original album itself). Favorite track include: `Never say die', `Raise your fist and shout', `X-ray specs', `Broken heart', `Welcome to the real world' and `Werewolf'.For any collector of 80s hard rock/glam metal or `Wig Wam' fan this is a piece of hair metal history that effectively stands the test of time.

"Maneuvers" is the second and last solo album by "ELP" bassist Greg Lake, originally released in 1983. As with the preceding self titled album, "Maneuvers" finds star guitarist Gary Moore in the ranks of Lake's band. It has to be clear that Lake's solo works have little to do with the prog rock style he is best known for. "Maneuvers" in particular is Greg turning AOR/melodic rock consciously producing songwriting- oriented music as opposed to performance-oriented music.For that matter upon first play one finds that "Maneuvers" comes rather close to the softer moments of Gary's solo album of that time "Corridors of Power". One comes to realize however that although largely melodic, Lake's second album keeps out anything that is not considered absolutely essential; the guitar solos are reduced to a minimum, the overall guitar playing for that matter is rather low in the mix, you can still make out that it is Gary's trademark playing yet all the performance extravaganza that usually surrounds his performance is left out. It has to be mentioned that Moore's songwriting contribution is minimal (merely given co-writing credit for three songs) while it has been claimed (though not objectively/historically verified) that Moore recorded all his guitar parts within a single day.On the second half of the album, the album takes a balladic turn becoming essentially a vehicle for Lake's vocals and despite the song's radio potential lacks the attack one would expect from the creative combo of Lake and Moore. Favorite tracks include "Too young for love", " Maneuvers" and "Paralyzed".

Conceived by the management of "Frontiers Records", "Allen-Lande" is the musical combination of two great metal lead singers, that of American Russell Allen ("Symphony-x") and Norwegian "Jorn Lande"("Masterplan") . Released in 2005, "The battle" features a total of 12 songs, six of which are duets while the other six feature individual performances by either singer. "Allen Lande" is written in its entirety by Swedish guitarist extraordinaire Magnus Karlsson ("Primal Fear", "Last Tribe") who also handles all guitars, bass and keyboards while drums are performed by Karlsson's former band mate "Jamie Salazar" ("Midnight sun").Having been composed entirely by the guitarist, it should be very much expected that the music on "The battle" is not quite aligned to the style of the singers' previous works. Indeed the album does not go down the progressive power metal path of "Symphony x" nor the dark and heavy sound of Jorn's solo albums; instead "The battle" is melodic metal, emphasizing instrumental and vocal harmonies while also being very positive and uplifting. For that matter the singers are provided with the perfect opportunity to uncover their great vocal abilities and shine through large choruses and melodic passages. It is also rather surprising how many similarities one can find between Russell's and Jorn's voices in terms of both sound and style.It has to also be addressed that instruments are emphasized just as much as the vocals on this album, you can expect big guitar riffs, loads of twin guitar melodies, harmonic up-front keyboards (often at the beginning of the song and during the choruses), plus dynamic drumming throwing in plenty of double bass kicks and toms. Favourite tracks include "My own way home", "Where have the angels gone", "Truth about our time", "Another battle"."The battle" would become the first album in the "Allen-Lande" trilogy of albums that would follow in the years to come; the musical combo of the project would go from strength to strength delivering more of the same great song-writing and musicianship that was first found on "The battle".

"Equilibrium" is the second album by German power AOR/melodic hard rock "S.I.N.(Somewhere into Nowhere)" originally released in 2005. One has to clarify that "S.I.N" play the most bombastic AOR ever: The thickest guitars, incredible amount of instrumental melodies and insane shredding, decimating rhythm section with double bass and huge toms plus super-flamboyant vocals. "S.I.N." is the best combination of technique and songwriting I have come across in the AOR genre.This second effort is the natural successor to their self titled 2003 debut and it is nothing less than a musical thrill. Each and every of the guys is a master on their respective instrument and shine throughout "Equilibrium". Lead singer Jason Marks has practically the same voice as rock legend Glenn Hughes, no note is too high or too low for the vocalist while also delivering the appropriate attitude form glamorous to romantic to hard rocking singing style. Guitarists Deddy Andler and Wolfgang Frank are at a league of their own, melodic line after line and solo after solo. Finally drummer Alex Hlousek is an expert at integrating furious double bass attack and toms without distorting the AOR essence of the songs.Favorite songs? what can I say? "Nail it to the wall", "It's forever", "Fight for my life", "The reason", "Johnny's running" all devastating arena AOR anthems yet track 8, "Nightwinds" effectively summarizes everything great about melodic rock, AOR and hard rock, definitely amongst the greatest songs I have ever heard.The musicianship and intensity of S.I.N. is unrivalled, shocking is the word to describe how good this group is. Imagine "Journey", "Talisman" and "Fair Warning" all rolled into one and that is merely an approximation of what "S.I.N.- Equilibrium" sounds like.

"Wild Frontier" is Gary Moore's 6th studio album of the 80s, originally released in 1987. Yet another European hit, "Wild Frontier" continues in the style of its predecessor "Run for cover", mixing political/protestant hard rockers with party/glam metal tunes. In contrast to its predecessor which featured a list of session players along with two legends of rock, "Wild Frontier" relied strictly on three musicians; these are Gary on guitars and vocals, Neil Carter on keyboards and vocals and Bob Daisley on bass. Unfortunately "Wild Frontier" seems to feature drum programming instead of physical drum performance which is somewhat of a let down considering the great drummers that played on the previous releases and could have contributed on "Wild Frontier".Never the less, one has to agree that "Wild Frontiers" is another slice of hard rock brilliance, outcome of the enviable musical talent of Moore. "Thunder rising" is one of the most devastating hard rockers ever, the mega-emotional "The loner", the impossibly epic "Over the hills and far away", the AOR-ish "Strangers in the darkness"; and of course "Wild Frontier" which carries-dare I say- the greatest melodic guitar line ever. From there onwards you get the heartbreaker "Take a little time", and equally enjoyable "Friday on my mind". You simply can not beat the choruses, the guitars, the harmonies and the lyricism on this album!"Wild Frontier" was supported by an arena tour of Europe, solidifying Moore's status amongst the most popular hard rock acts in the continent. As before Gary delivered a classic album totally indicative of his song-writing and performing abilities; A genuine `80s rocker.

"Victims of the future" is the fourth* solo album by legendary Gary Moore originally released in 1984; "Victims..." as its title suggests turned out to be the darkest in Moore's lengthy catalogue. By the songs titles alone, one can easily make out that this album is indeed an unconventional perhaps anti-popular offering. Songs like "Murder in the skies", "Shapes of things" and "Victims of the future" are totally indicative of the lyrical direction of the album carrying mighty protestant choruses but also an underlying pessimism-even the ballad "Empty Rooms" is sad in essence. "Hold on to love" is perhaps the only ray of light on "Victims of the future".It is therefore ironic that "Victims of the future" solidified Moore's status in Europe as one a leading artist in the hard & heavy genres receiving credit from both classic rockers and metal-heads alike. One also notes that, on "Victims...", Moore began to move away from the band format, using a number of musicians as session players: bass is contributed by Neil Murray, Bob Daisley and Mo Foster while drums tracks are split between Ian Paice and Bobby Chouinard, finally keyboards are performed by Neil Carter.Overall, it would be fair to say that idiosyncratically "Victims of the future" is a genuine heavy metal album, in the sense that it is provocative, challenging, and intense while daring to address sensitive issues. By 1984 it should have become clear to fans that Gary Moore was an artist committed in pushing the creative barriers (if there were any such) of his music delivering landmark after landmark.*Counting from 1980 onwards, his fourth solo album in the style of `80s rock.

"After the war" is the 7th * studio album by guitar legend Gary Moore originally released in 1989 and was to be his last effort in the hard rock/metal genres. "After the war" ranks easily amongst Moore's heavier releases if not the heaviest; the album makes direct references to a preceding album "Victims of the future" his most protestant and anti-popular-lyric-wise album. The line up features Gary on lead vocals and guitar, Neil Carter on keyboards, bassist Bob Daisley and iconic drummer Cozy Powell.As always the melodies and choruses are immensely catchy despite being conceptually based on war as a social phenomenon. This time the riffs are faster and the production is thicker suggesting that "After the war" is just as much a metal album as it is hard rock. Songs like "Speak for yourself", "After the war" and "Running from the storm" are totally indicative of the direction of the album while also expanding into different rock areas. There is the ballad "The messiah will come again", the AOR tunes "Living on dreams" and "Ready for love", the sarcastic "Led clones" featuring non other that Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals, never forgetting the orchestral opus "Blood of Emeralds" a tribute to his late friend and band-mate Phil Lynott.Overall "After the war" is indeed Moore's most diverse album in the hard rock genre and the last in the particular genre of music. Once again great songs, outstanding performances and some of the greatest names in rock all featured on this released.* 7th in the 80s hard rock genre

Joshua Perahia is an American guitarist in the Hard Rock/Glam metal/AOR fields of rock; he is perceived by many to be the fastest guitar player/shredder in the world surpassing the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen and Chris Impellitteri. What is undeniable though is that from the early 80s to 2001 he released a total of five groundbreaking hard rock albums; "Intense defense" is his third studio album originally released in 1988. This line up is set to include iconic singer Rob Rock (ex Axel Rudi Pell, Impellitteri, Solo), bass player Emil Leigh, drummer Tim Gehrt and Greg Schultz on keyboards.Even under the strictest perspective "Intense Defense" stands as a very good hard rock album offering a number of great tracks such as "Only yesterday", "Look to the Sky", Crying out for love" and "Don't you know".On a personal level what I found really interesting is that many British rock/metal journalists consider and have adamantly stated that "Intense Defense" is the greatest AOR album of all time. Sure "Int. Defense" is a powerful statement in rock but it is by no means flawless; Rob's vocals although technically perfect could be considered as typical and not as colorful. Joshua's guitar playing is nothing out of the ordinary throughout this album; it has to be pointed out that Joshua was never one to reach his speed limit in every song but throughout "Intense defense" there is literally no evidence of his "legendary" shredding speed (as was more than apparent on his previous releases). Overall "I.D." stands nowhere near its predecessor "Surrender" (1985) which was simply a barrage of speeding melodies and a masterpiece of a composition.If Joshua has indeed recorded the greatest AOR album of all time then this would be "Surrender" not "Intense Defence"

"Masterplan" is the debut album by all star European melodic-power metal band "Masterplan" originally released in 2003. Having departed from the ranks of "Helloween", lead guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch chose to put together a new metal outfit featuring renowned singer-and solo artist at the time- Jorn Lande. The line up was completed by key player Alex Mackenrott and bassist Jan Eckert.The musical approach of "Masterplan" would include melodic keyboards, thick rhythm guitars, inventive drumming and large choruses while integrating melodic and rhythm progressions that make the compositions stand out, effectively establishing the band's personal style."Masterplan" came out conceptually darker than member's previous bands/works with lyrics often filled with irony and sarcasm (best examples "Soulburn" and "Enlighten me" , while other times delivering hope and determination "Spirit never die" and "Heroes". Although far from the optimistic melodic metal "Masterplan"s melodic-power-progressive metal combination delivered a very appealing product; and I do consider that it is their ability to combine minor and major melodies along with lyrical optimism and pessimism that sets them apart from the majority of bands. "Masterplan" is an album that should rightfully be considered a classic of melodic, power and progressive metal that delivers musical substance more than anything else.

"Heroes" is the third studio album by German melodic rock band `Casanova', originally released in 1999-limited to the Japanese market. `AOR Heaven' has reissued `Heroes' in a 2CD pack including the mini-album `Sway'.`Casanova' was the band put together by the German pioneer of Christian hard rock, guitarist/vocalist Michael Voss, having debuted in 1992 after the break-up of Michael's original outfit "Mad Max"."Heroes" was perhaps the lightest of the band's releases yet quality AOR over and over. There are minor hints of 90s mainstream rock on the album though these are usually swept under the melodic nature of "Heroes". In terms of songwriting, `Heroes' retains the high musical standards of the previous albums while prioritizing compositions over performance. For that matter, the protagonist instrument on `Heroes' are Michael's vocals; arguably his best-to-date performances are included on this album, proving that apart from a hard rock/metal vocalist, Voss is a great AOR singer.It has to be addressed that the album includes a fair amount of undistorted guitars while the solos are reduced to a minimum. Still the overall quality of the songs makes the above fact barely noticeable. In particular the mid tempo songs `Revenge', `Heaven knows' and `Star' along with the opener `Heroes' and the heavier `Stranded' are indeed timeless material that arguably sound more relevant today that in the early 90s.

"Do You Miss Me" is the sixth studio album by melodic rock/AOR singer Robin Beck originally released in 2005, marking the American vocalist's debut collaboration with "Frontiers Records". "Do you miss me" was Robin's second album since her 2003 comeback in the music scene.With the cover artwork and album title being far less flashy than what fans would probably expect from the `80s rock queen, I was concerned that "Do you miss me" could have been more of a pop record than a rock one. However, it did turn out that "Do you miss" me is a rocking as any work of Robin's in the late `80s and early `90s, perhaps even heavier!In retrospect, it could not have been any other way with renowned AOR authority Fabrizio Grossi ("Los Angeles") producing the album as well as playing bass on it. The studio line up also features accomplished guitarists Steffi Hazan and Nick Savio, drummer Francis Koch and James Christian ("House of Lords") contributing keyboards."Do you miss me" is a substantially guitar driven album with each song opening on rather heavy riffs (by AOR standards) and ever-present rhythm guitars plus the solos are really shredding. The rhythm section is also a big part of the album even though perhaps the album would have benefited from an even thicker drum sound. Above all there is no shortage of memorable melodic (hard) rockers on "Do you miss me".The attack of the title track, the AOR smoothness of "Your love is tough", featuring an unforgettable chorus, the intense power ballad "The safest place", the up beat "What about us" and the bass-driven "Stone by Stone" are just six out of twelve substantial melodic rock song featured on "Do you miss me". If you are a fan of female fronted melodic rock, or enjoyed the works of Fiona Flanagan, Lee Aaron, Issa and Robin's earlier material, you can't go wrong with this album.

This is the fourth studio release by the "Tygers of Pan Tang" originally released in 1982. Although their monumental album "Spellbound" (1981), which effectively defined the N.W.O.B.H.M. genre, is their career highlight, its follow up "The Cage" is just as historic and influential for a different reason:This album is the first Glam Metal record of the 80s; the originator of a sound that was to be undertaken and developed by the likes of American powerhouses such as "Quiet Riot" "Motley Cure", "Ratt", "White Lion" etc.Sound wise the album's choruses are sung "choir-like" in the style that was later to be recognized as poser vocals. The drum toms are synthesized to deliver that extremely huge sound while the guitars add standard rhythm parts topped by catchy melodies.Time has shown that this album's biggest hit came to be the frenetic cover version of "love potion number 9" however the release features superior- metal wise- songs such as "Lonely at the top", "Paris by Air", "Danger in Paradise", and a masterpiece of a composition which is "The Actor"If you are a fan of 80s US & Euro Glam metal, buy this and apart from the tremendous classics you will hear where it all begun.

Having reentered the international music scene in 2008 by fronting Swedish hard rock band `Gypsy Rose', American singer David Reece (ex-"Accept") debuted his solo career in 2009 with the `Universal language' album. 2010 finds David Reece a reestablished figure in the hard rock/melodic metal world, fronting beyond his own band acts like `Gypsy Rose' and American hard rockers `Tango Down'.On account of the previous conditions it seems as the perfect occasion for the re-issue of the `Bangalore Choir' debut `On target'; as most are aware David put together the band after leaving `Accept' in 1990 with their subsequent debut being released in 1992.As a reissue the album features the original ten tracks plus the promo video for `Loaded gun' but no bonus tracks; in addition the cover artwork also deviates from the original. Yet, to its defense, the album benefits hugely from the very effective re mastering of Martin Kronlund (`Gypsy Rose') who literally updates the sound of the album being easily comparable to the production of David's latest works (You will have to excuse me, but I have not heard the original CD of 1992 in order to make a direct comparison with this re-mastered version).In terms of performance I do not think there is much that has not been discussed before: The material switches effortlessly between hard rock, glam metal and at times melodic metal featuring infectious melodies, seriously heavy riffs (for early 90s), and unforgettable choruses. As many have claimed, Reece's performance is indeed stellar (and at times beyond stellar) while a pleasant surprise may be found on the lead guitar parts of John Kirk and Curt Mitchell exchanging melodies and extensive shredding making the guitar solos an equally standout factor of `On target' in the process.For collectors of classic hard rock, glam metal albums this is an obvious purchase, for those who enjoyed "Gypsy Rose- Another world", "Reece-Universal Language" or "Accept-Eat the Heat" this is a must.One is very pleased to find out that `Bangalore choir' have actually reformed and are working on their second album as David has stated amongst various interviews.

Debut album from American neoclassical guitar shredder Chris Impellitteri originally released in 1988. At the time the narrow neoclassical metal scene was dominated by Yngwie Malmsteen's "Rising Force". Obviously wanting a piece of the sales pie, Impelliteri recruits Graham Bonnet (who had once taken Malmsteen under his wing) and put together the greatest alterative the scene had to offer with the addition of bassist Chuck Wright (Quiet Riot, House of lords) and Pat Torpey on drums (Mr. Big).Music wise the songs sound quite like an updated version of "Alcatrazz" while certain riffs sound more than familiar to Malmsteen's "Rising Force-Marching Out" album. From there on things get rocketed. For starters the production is top quality with devastating guitar sound and perfectly sustained drums. The real selling point of Impellitteri however is the speed at which the guy plays; It is quite difficult to describe what is like soloing twice as fast as Malmsteen but "Guitar racer" could feed the imagination, the guy's guitar just erupts with notes.Although in theory it has all been done before, one can not help but be impressed when hearing Impellitteri shred for the first time.

"Slaves and Masters" is the second studio album by German melodic hard rock/AOR band "Jaded Heart" originally released in 1996. Once again "Jaded Heart" brought to front their brand of "Bonfire"-meets-"Bon Jovi" rock with a clear `80s orientation.The line up features lead singer Michael Bormann (who also performs some of the rhythm guitars on the album), bassist Michael Muller, drummer Axel Kruse, new entry keyboardist Chris Ivo along with session contributions by guitar wizard Alex Beyrodt ("Sinner").In comparison to its predecessor, "Slaves and Masters" is a substantially heavier album, bringing to front thicker guitar riffs, heavier rhythm section, less keyboards (despite having a keyboardist as a full-time member), but just as melodic vocal lines and choruses. Songwriting-wise "Slaves and Masters" is not that far away from the previous album "Inside Out" perhaps somewhat more aggressive/sarcastic in the lyrical department but overall a faithful continuation of the well established German melodic rock style.It has to be addressed that the production quality of "Slaves and Masters" is far from great, the final mix sounds fairly loose while the guitar riffs often undermine the rhythm section. Never the less, that did not stop "Jaded Heart" from delivering such melodic hard rock highlights as "Lust", "Without no Warning ","I'm still holding on" and "Dangerous". Overall "Slaves and Masters" proved a fitting follow up to "Jaded Heart"s debut, also laying the ground for a lasting career through the `90s and `00s.

After scoring their first minor hit with the preceding 2004 album `Forged by Fire', band leader and guitar phenomenon Gus G. stood in as the second lead guitarist in Swedish melodic death metal band `Arch Enemy' during their 2005 `Ozzfest' US dates. After fulfilling his duties, Gus G. took the career decision of leaving the various musical projects he was involved in as guitarist (including `Dream Evil', `Mystic Prophecy' and `Nightrage') in order to step up his efforts regarding his own band `Firewind'.Gus decided that `Firewind', now a full time band, should be based in Greece for better coordination and flexibility; therefore Norwegian drummer Stian Kristoffersen exited the line up along with singer Chity Somapala who had already left during Gus' stint with `Arch Enemy'. The remaining Greek members, bass player Petros Christo, key player Bob Katsionis and Gus were joined by British-German drum titan Mark Cross (ex-Metalium) who had been long residing in Greece and Swedish singer (of Greek heritage) Apollo Papathanassiou (ex `Majestic', ex `Meduza') a musician with significant contribution in the neoclassic metal genre. The voice and approach of the new lead singer came closer to that of original vocalist Stephen Frederick, still the overall sound and direction of the new line-up stood fairly apart from the power/neoclassic style they had established during their earlier albums.`Allegiance' released in Europe during the summer of 2006 marked the recording debut of this particular line up; the first to gather the entire band in the same studio (JM- Fredman studios in Sweden)and the first to feature song writing contributions from all five band members. The result saw the band growing in all directions and `Allegiance' subsequently becoming the most diverse `Firewind' album to date.From mid tempo metal opuses like `Allegiance' to melodic metal tunes `Insanity', `Ready to strike' and `the essence' to power metal epics `Till the end of time' plus a few slower moments `Deliverance', `Before the storm', the album clearly showcased the diverse talents that 'Firewind' now consisted of.The album effortlessly climbed the official domestic music charts top 10 and established a presence for a good number of weeks. That was largely due to success of the two hit singles, the duet `Breaking the silence' (featuring singer Tara Teresa) and `Falling to pieces' which came to be their biggest hit till that day.`Allegiance' is definitely an album to place `Firewind' amongst the leading forces in European melodic/power metal, it is the very definition of collective band effort, perfect start to finish material and incredible production.On a personal level, it was almost a shock to discover how much the band had grown form the previous album (which was actually less than a year prior to Allegiance). At that point musically they could stand to toe with any other highly acclaimed band of the genre.Metal Hammer (Greek magazine) issue 259 marks this album with 8,5/10 commenting: "The musicians are top of the top, the production is impressive, the compositions solid and worked to perfection.

Every Beat of My Heart is the third studio album by iconic AOR singer Stan Bush originally released in 1992. "Ever Beat..." took a further step in the commercial rock direction of the late `80s-early `90s, proving an obvious successor to "Stan Bush & Barrage".This third album saw Stan's return in the solo artist format as opposed to the band scenario he adopted during the mid-80s. Without a doubt, "Every Beat" is even more polished than the previous two albums, clearly favoring the keyboards over the guitar; that is not to say that guitar parts have been reduced, simply they come somewhat lower in the mix while thankfully the six-string solos establish a firm presence once again. One has to adress that tempos have also dropped on "Every Beat..." making mid-tempo and ballads the norm. Never the less, Stan compensates by delivering some of his best choruses and many incredible vocal lines overall.To his credit, Bush once again writes or co-writes the entire album, including some high profile collaborations; Jonathan Cain co-writes three of the songs and Jim Vallance an additional two. Songs like the opener "Straight to the top", the intense "It don't get better than this", and the bitter "Ain't that worth something" are true AOR highlights of the early `90s that sound equally convincing a good twenty years later.

This is the latest studio album from "Riot". This band has traveled through most styles spanning the rock- metal genre in the pursuit of identity. Yet in retrospect Mark Reale managed to set a faade of an unpredictable and unreliable band.Never the less, this album rocks from the start to the very finish. This is fantastic up beat hard rock that almost touches the barriers of speed metal. The compositions are so solid, the riffs so inspired and complex and the choruses so huge that it seems almost unreal in comparison to previous "Riot" albums. So this is shaped up to be a very good album. However it goes beyond that.There is incredible passion and aggression in the performances which together with the raw production make this release sound like an explosive debut from a promising "old school" hard rock band."Riot" decided to get their hands dirty and surpass themselves and they were rewarded; when this album was originally released (fall 2006) it reached number 7 on the Japanese charts.

1993 studio album from AOR mastermind Paul Sabu. This release is by far the lightest Sabu record, very much in the sound of early 90s Alice Cooper. Still Sabu remains true to his hard/glam roots without giving in to the grunge trend. This album is said to be amongst his most commercially successful, leaving quite a lasting impression in Japan. A very cohesive album, perhaps a bit too easy to listen to but definitely worth the attention.If you are having trouble finding this album try tracing it under the name "Paul Sabu- In dreams" It is exactly the same album with a different cover and track order. Amazon.co.uk still has a few copies for 19.00 pounds.

Finally re-issued is "Tough it out", the second studio album by leading British AOR/melodic rock band "FM" originally released in 1989. Both "Tough it out" and its predecessor "Indiscreet" have been just released by "Rock Candry" records both featuring re-mastered versions of the original albums plus extra tracks."Tough it out" in particular features the original 11-track album plus four additional songs along with an extended version. In retrospect "Tough it out" proved a huge leap ahead for the band artistically. Not so much in terms of songwriting (as "FM" offered first class AOR from day one) but in terms of arrangements. There is an essence of extravaganza that emanates from "Tough it out" be it the much heavier distorted guitars, the bigger drumming or the intense vocal performances, the second "FM" album finds the band turning everything to eleven while retaining the same great songwriting of their debut.The line up also remained unchanged since their debut featuring singer-mastermind Steve Overland, guitarist Chris Overland, bassist Merv Goldsworthy, drummer Pete Jupp and keyboardist Didge Digital. From the infectious chorus of the opening title-track you known you are into the best `80s rock feast you probably missed upon its release, followed by the superb "Bad Luck", the hit "Someday you'll come running", "Burning my heart down" and "The Dream that Died". Overall the "Rock Candy" reissue does perfect justice to a gem of a rock album of the late `80s that should never have gone out of print.

"Into the light" is the anniversary all star project album originally released in 2007 celebrating the 20th anniversary of "Nuclear Blast" as a heavy metal record label. The project features a rather stable instrumental line up with each song featuring a different lead singer. Vocalists participating on this album are Tobias Sammet, Toni Kakko, Peter Wagner, Mats Leven, Hansi Kursch, Andi Deris, Odleif Stensland, Marko Hietala and Tarja Turunen.Now, as far as songwriting goes, the whole album is composed by "Rage" virtuoso guitarist Victor Smolski with occasional aid in lyrics by his fellow bandmate Peter Wagner. As expected, Victor plays all the guitars on the album while also handling the bass and keyboards on most of them. The drums are performend by Andre Hilgers (who would become the new drummer of "Rage" after the completion of the project). The musical approach of "Into the light" is falls within the melodic metal genre and in fact comes rather close to the style of "Rage" while the mood is bound to change from one song to the next. Favorite tracks include: "Dirty Wings", "Ruling the World", "A perfect day", "and Inner Sanctuary" and "In the picture".Through a very practical view, one could also regard "Into the light" as a Victor Smolski solo album, being the only consistent presense throughout the album and the master songwriter. He also opens the album's booklet notes welcoming the audience and commenting on the experience; following each of the singers participating, contributes a few liner notes of their relationship with the record label. Overall, "Into the light" is a satsifactory all star project that brings to front the amazing songwriting talent of Smolski while also carrying the essence of "Rage".

Having debuted his solo career in the late `70s, American singer/guitarist/producer Paul Sabu released two studio album during the early `80s; the first under the band name "Kidd Glove"(1984) and the second as "Paul Sabu-Heartbreak"(1985). In 1988 the front man re-emerged under a new band-name "Only Child".The new out-fit featured beyond Paul on lead vocals and guitars, bassist Murrill Maglio, keyboardist Tommy Rude and drummer Charles Esposito (who also played on the "Heartbreak" album. Essentially "Only Child" was Sabu's attempts to combine his trademark AOR sound with the glam metal style of the late `80s."Only Child" is built equally on guitars and keyboards handling the majority of melodies on the album, only topped by Sabu's incredible Coverdale/Winger-like vocals. The rhythm section deviates somewhat from the over-produced pounding sound of most late `80s recordings being rather natural sounding still including its fair share of toms."Only Child" is considered by many one of the best AOR albums of all time; though one might find the claim exaggerative, the album is clearly a solid work in melodic hard rock/glam metal featuring such highlights as "Always", "I remember the night", "I believe in you" and "Save a place in your heart" are the cream of `80s Adult oriented rock.

This is a 2011 reissue of "Draconian Times" by British heavy/gothic metal band "Paradise lost" originally released in 1995. The album supports the current "Draconian Times" European tour where the band performs the album live in its entirety. As this package is mainly addressed to "Paradise Lost" fans, the review will be strictly limited to the features of this particular package (and not on the music itself, having been explored extensively on previous reviews)This reissue comes in a (rectangular) book-like, hard cover with glossy front and sparkly artwork followed by a forty-page booklet . The booklet is filled with artwork stylistically similar to the front cover, also featuring an introduction by band leader Nick Holmes as well as comments by each member of the band. The cover is not exactly as pictured here, in fact, the band logo and album title are printed under the face pictured (not on its right side).This reissue is a 2 disc set, a CD and a DVD. The CD features the original 12-track "Draconian Times" album, originally released in 1995; complemented by seven more tracks two of which are demos while the other five are live version of "DT" songs recorded in Germany in 1995. The DVD features the album in a 5.1. Surround mix plus the two promo videos shot in support of the album.One has to comment that this 2011 reissue is a very classy package, definitely a hot collectors item that does justice to this classic album. Although I am not the biggest "Paradise Lost" fan, by any means, I could not resist but purchase this version of "Draconian Times". A high quality item indeed!

"Saints and Sinners" is the 5th studio album by legendary hard rock band "Whitesnake" originally released in 1982. At the time "Whitesnake" had established their reputation as a leading hard rock act in Europe with continuous chart success in their home country. "Whitesnake" was the last album to be recorded under the original line up of lead singer David Coverdale, guitarists Mick Moodie and Bernie Marsden, bassist Neil Murray, keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice.Although most fans would consider "Slide it in"(1984) to be "Whitesnake"s major transition from a blues-rock band to an 80s-rock group, I personally consider "Saints and Sinners" as Coverdale's first attempt in the hard & heavy sound. Songs like "Young Blood", "Rock'n roll angels", and "Dancing girls" are prime examples of early `80s melodic hard rock with a spicy/kinky twist. In addition the album carries two early versions of songs which would later rank amongst the greatest rock anthems of the decade-non other than "Crying in the rain" and "Here I go again"."Saints and sinners" puts forward a great deal of performance aggression with speed, heaviness and technique moving upwards on the "Whitesnake" agenda of goals. While David and co always put forward song-writing, on "Saints and Sinners" the man decided that performance should weight as heavily as composing. Overall "Saints and sinners" is amongst "Whitesnake"s undervalued records although it can easily stand up to the quality of their later works. The album's commercial success also led "Whitesnake" headlining the Donnington `Monsters of rock' festival in 1983 for the first time.

"Alexa" is the AOR/melodic rock debut by female vocalist Alexa Anastasia originally released in 1989. Despite baring the name of the Swiss singer, "Alexa" is often considered to have been directed entirely by songwriter/guitarist Paul Sabu who was the driving force behind this project.Indeed the line up that recorded "Alexa" are actually the members of Sabu's late `80s outfit "Only Child" featuring bassist Murrill Maglio, key-player Tommy Rude, drummer Charles Esposito and Paul only on guitars as all vocals were performed by Alexa. Excluding the singer, the rest of the line up cut one of the greatest-arguably-AOR albums of all time, the "Unruly Child" debut, therefore fans of the group should expect that Alexa's album is just as strong a melodic offering.Indeed the two projects are very similar in most ways. Primarily the compositions are mid tempo, for the biggest part, featuring equal amounts of guitars and keyboards. The harmonious keyboards carry stereotypical, yet indispensable harmonies on each song while Sabu's lead guitar playing is outstanding. Alexa herself bares a very similar singing style to that of the guitarist, often considered his female vocal equivalent, baring the same rough edge on her mid/bass range while modeling her extra-intense performances after Sabu's example. It is hard to dispute that "We don't remember why", "Let it rock", "Heart to heart" "A cry away", have the quality of classic AOR tracks, as they peak on both songwriting and performance. For admires of female fronted melodic rock in the style of "Heart", "Robin Beck" and "If only" or fans of Paul Sabu and "Unruly Child", "Alexa" is satisfaction guaranteed.

"Metal will stand tall" is the debut album of Swedish glam metal stars "The Poodles" originally released in 2006. While the 00s signified the return of many glorified hard rock/glam metal bands and an even larger amount of newcomers of the genre hailing mainly from the Scandinavian countries, the US and Italy, this group managed to stand apart from most other acts for a number of reasons.Although formed in 2005, "The Poodles" featured seasoned musicians of the Scandinavian rock/metal scene: lead singer Jakob Samuels was the original drummer of Swedish-American hard rock band "Talisman" while guitarist Pontus Norgren played for Jeff Scott Soto and "Zan Clan" amongst others. The line up was completed by Pontus Egberg ("Lion's Share") and drummer Christian "Kicken" Lundqvist.Originally the band was put together to participate on the annual European song contest "Eurovision" promoting the song "Nights of Passion" which was totally indicative of their enviable songwriting abilities. Their domestic success and booming popularity led to this debut album "Metal will stand tall" bringing to front the classic hair metal sound with increased emphasis on melody and style. On that count not only did they prove themselves capable of outstanding choruses, blinding guitar solos and incredible rhythm but they also personified musical glamour like no other band: Big hair, extravagant clothing, fluent rock-star attitude and poodle dogs on every picture.So clearly "The poodles" play glam, look glam and live glam plus their accumulated experience brought to front such amazing songs, "Metal will stand tall", "Shadows" "Kingdom of heaven", "Echoes of the past" and the potential mega hit "Night of passion" established the band as a protagonist in post-millennium hard rock/glam metal.On a personal level "The Poodles" have been amongst my favorite bands since this debut album as they excel on all counts, an impressive all around outfit that would grow bigger with each release.

Kinrick is the brain child of guitarist Corbin King ("Vainglory") and vocalist Stephen Frederick (ex "Firewind"); this line up is completed by James Martin on bass and ex "Firewind" drummer Stjian Cristoffersen. This collaboration delivers very honest and powerful American metal. If you have an opinion on the first two "Firewind" albums then you might agree that this effort comes very close to that style. The eastern feeling is here yet, unlike "Firewind", this album is more heavy than melodic. The rhythm section is impeccable, King's guitar parts similar to Gus G's (of "Firewind") and Stephen's vocals are the inevitable focal point. Still comparison between these two groups will not be in the favor of Kinrick. Band members were not involved in the songwriting process of this release as all compositions were put together by producer David Chaistain; consequently the end result tends to be typical rather than something promising and exciting, as most have come to expect from Stephen Frederick.Hopefully songwriting issues will have been resolved until the next Kinrick album.

This item was my introduction to the music of Ralf Scheepers and Mat Sinner. The album, as all Primal Fear releases goes way beyond the typical euro power/heavy/speed metal; this release is colorful, a result of true inspiration recorded mixed and mastered by the highest standards of 2002 with attention paid to every detail.You will realize that these people are perfectionists. Guitarists Henny Wolter and Stefan Leibing are technically impeccable even though they carry out complex solos, phrase exchanges and double melodies. Bassist Mat Sinner and Drummer Klaus Sperling manage to keep a surprisingly solid rhythm section and finally vocalist Ralf Scheepers dubs the lyrics with three sets of vocal approaches definitely inspired by the Priest style, yet comparison between Sceepers and Halford will not be to the benefit of Priest fans.This album reached number 12 in Japan (Burrn charts) during 2002. Collectively it is said that this album has sold more than 300.000 copies worldwide.Finally beyond standards, this is a very enjoyable album that will satisfy fans seeking for powerful music as well as people who want to get more in the detail of things.

"III" clearly titled is the third studio album by American melodic rock/AOR band "Unruly Child" originally released in 2003. A good five years past the release of "Waiting for the Sun", original members Bruce Gowdy (guitars, bass) and Guy Allison (Keyboards) are joined by lead singer Philip Bardowell, were set to deliver a new album to the fast rising Italian label "Frontiers Records"."III" marks a considerable departure from the subtle, semi-acoustic style that defined Child's previous works. This third studio effort effectively breaks the boundaries of adult oriented rock, entering guitar driven melodic hard rock territory. Indeed the electric guitars are brought to the forefront of the stereo, serving as the leading instrument along with Bardowell's vocals naturally- not to mention that we are treated to a much thicker production (with the rhythm section and riffs beefed-up in the mix).Though the songwriting is classic "Unruly Child" at essence, the delivery draws unmistakably towards Frontier's house-sound, a production that defines the majority of releases coming from the particular label. By no means has that fact undermined the quality of "III" being another solid melodic rock album and one where Philip establishes his potential as a voice to be reckoned within the genre. Songs like "Kings of tragedy", the opening "Tear me down" and "Falling" are prime examples of the line up's creative class. Overall "III" through a more generic melodic rock record should satisfy AOR audiences beyond "Unruly Child"s hardcore fans.

"Premonition" is the second album by American melodic rock/AOR band "Survivor" originally released in 1980, reissued in 2010 by "Rock Candy Records". "Premonition", was an additional step towards the identifiable "Survivor" sound, bringing to front more of their melodic essence while retaining a good deal of the hard rock style of their debut. "Premonition" was also the first album to feature the established rythm section of bassist Stephan Ellis and drummer Marc Droubay along side founders guitarist Frankie Sullivan, keyboardist Jim Peterik and singer David Bickler.The album as expected opens on such rockers as "Chevy Nights", Summer Nights" and "Poor Man's Son" followed by such pomp AOR tunes as "Runway Lights" the epic "Light of a thousand smiles" and "Love is on my side". There is also the power-ballad "Hearts a lonely hunter" built on an unconventional but absolutely stimulating guitar/keyboard melody, which serves as an early verification that "Survivor" belong to an artistic league of their own.While most would consider "Vital Signs", "When Seconds Count" and "Eye of the Tiger" as the ultimate "Survivor" albums, "Premonition" has more than enough musical depth and substance to challenge their most popular works. If you are a fan of pomp-adult oriented rock you can not go wrong with "Remonition".

"Space Odyssey" is a Swedish neoclassical metal project and "The astral episode' is their second album originally released in 2005. Led by Keyboard virtuoso Richard Anderson, "Space Odyssey" is fronted by vocal powerhouse Patrik Johansson ("Astral Doors", "Lion's share")featuring guitarist Magnus Nilsson who also performs the bass on the album as well as drummer Andreas Brobjer."The astral episode" turned out to be the most progressive work of Andersson's up until that time; the guitar parts have been substantially increased, now demonstrating equal presence to the keyboards on the album, while the riffs have become more complicated and the instrumental passages more extensive. Johansson's vocal performance is at the very top with a style that makes direct reference to R.J. Dio and David Coverdale; still one has to comment that choruses are not as large as on the previous album. Having said that, despite the instrumental progressions throughout the album, Patrik manages to steal the show once again, effectively delivering empathy, agression and drama into "Space Odyssey's" progressive mixture.One must alsoa add that the tracklist is somewhat short featuring merely 8 songs, keeping in mind that Richard's previous works featured 10 tracks at minimum. If you enjoy neoclassical metal with a strong progressive element, instrumental battles between guitars and keyboards, as well as commanding vocal perofrmances then "Space Odyssey- The astral episode" is a fit purchase.

"Hordes of the brave" is the second studio album by Belgian neoclassical metal band "Iron Mask" originally released in 2005. Amongst fans of the genre "Iron Mask" are recognized as the musical vehicle of guitar hero Dushan Petrozzi; yet "Hordes of the Brave" features a group of talented performers who match the mastermind in performance quality.Lead singer Val Halla Jr. is one of the greatest voices in contemporary neoclassical metal with a tone and distorted vibrato practically identical to Graham Bonnett and Stephen Fredrik. It would be fair to say that Val Halla does steal the show on "Hordes of the Brave" delivering such stellar melodic metal moments adding depth and almost another musical dimension to Dushan's compositions.Equally important is the contribution of keyboardist Richard Andersson, known from such solo projects as "Space Odyssey" and "Majestic" who dresses the melodic guitar lines with his own keyboard orchestrations a-la "Royal Hunt" which in turn grants a different flavor to "Hordes of the Braves".Songs like "Freedom's blood", "Holy War", "Crystal Tears" and "My eternal flame" are indeed the cream of neoclassical metal even though they tend to be overlooked by fans of the genre. Fans of early "Firewind", "Royal Hunt" and "Golden Resurrection", should definitely give this incredible release a chance.

"Blue murder" is the self titled debut album of the melodic hard rock/glam metal group featuring guitarist/vocalist John Sykes, drum legend Carmine Appice and bassist Tony Franklin, originally released in 1989. Having composed and recorded one of the top selling rock albums of the 80s as a member of "Whitesnake", John Sykes was removed from the ranks of the band, though offered a solo album deal by "Geffen Records". The musicians that would accompany him were arguably the ideal complement for Sykes; Carmine, the very definition of hard rock drummer, had released a series of quality 80s rock albums as the leader of "King Kobra" while Tony Franklin being the fretless bass master in hard rock sealed the enviable rhythm section.Conceptually the approach on the "Blue Murder" debut is similar to that of "Whitesnake-1987" Thick riffs, catchy choruses, endless amount of harmonies, romantic, often sexual, lyrics as well as substantial ballads. In addition "Blue murder" retain to a certain extent the "Whitesnake" groove which is expected to differ somewhat being performed by such an original rhythm section. Songs like "Sex child", "Black hearted woman", "Billy", "Blue murder" and are first class melodic hard rock material, particularly the first two songs named could have easily served for a "Whitesnake" release. These is also the incredible heartbreaker ballad "Out of love" very much in the style of "Is this love" only more intense and dramatic.Indeed "Blue Murder" picks up where "Whitesnake-1987" left off, unquestionably the album bares a personality of its own, yet evidently conceived on the same principles that made "1987" such an iconic record. It is rather unfortunate that "Blue murder" was to be the only album recorded by this stellar line up.

Following the multi-platinum success of their debut album, prog/melodic rock group "Asia" attempting to capitalize on the success of such songs as "Thrill of the Moment" and "Only Time Would Tell" by putting out an album that would focus entirely on melodic, radio-friendly songwriting. That album was "Alpha"."Asia" retain their original line-up of keyboardist Geoffrey Downes, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, drummer Carl Palmer and guitarist Steve Howe and with the former two names at the helm of the songwriting process deliver a remarkable collection of instant-melodic rock classics."Alpha", despite its impressive vocal/keyboard performances, is first and foremost about the songwriting. Every song on this second album has perfectly defined opening melody, main body, bridge and chorus. Production-wise "Alpha" is bigger than its predecessor particularly when it comes to the choirs and backing vocals while the keyboard harmonies and the rhythm patterns are definitely catchier than the ones found on their debut. The optimistic "Don't cry", the romantic "The Smile has left your eyes", the epic "Never in a Million years" and the anthemic "My own Time" are rightfully considered classics in `80s melodic rock but the pompous "True Colors" and the intense "The heat goes on" are truly unsurpassable moments for the genre.

"Magdallan" is the hard rock band/project put together by former "House of Lords" members guitarist Lanny Cordola, bassist Chuck Wright and drummer Ken Mary, fronted by "Shout" vocalist Ken Tamplin. "Big Bang" is the US supergroup's debut album, originally released in 1992. Though featuring three fifths of the original "House of Lords" line up, it would be fair to say that style-wise "Magdallan"s brand of hard rock was fundamentally different to that of the "...Lords".For the biggest part "Big Bang" draws towards the style of "Van Halen" and early David Lee Roth solo-works. So you can expect grooves, unconventional guitar riffs and leads plus often playful vocals (although it has been expressed that "Magdallan" lyrics may be interpreted in an allegorical sense, given the band's Christian orientation).Performance-wise, Tamplin defends his status as a powerhouse melodic hard rock vocalist making clever use of his incredible range. In addition Lanny's performance is far superior to his "...Lords/Giuffria" recordings, holding nothing back on "Big Bang", be it shredding, twin guitar leads or unconventional melodies, the guitarist manages to impress on all songs.Fans of "House of Lords" and "Giuffria" will probably make the most of the more melodic/AOR tunes on this debut such as "Radio Bikini", "Love to rescue" and "House of Dreams"; most other songs on the album feature various musical twists and turns, having little in common with typical `80s melodic rock. Conclusively "Magdallan-Big Bang" is an worthwhile addition to the collection of "House of Lords" and "Giuffria" fans while baring in mind that for the biggest part the outfit plays a different brand of rock that does not fit entirely under the AOR/melodic rock genre.

The "Live and Dangerous" video recordings:One can not argue that Thin Lizzy's "Live and Dangerous" record is one of the most influential live albums of all time. The original album consisted of material captured during the period 1976-1978; yet there is considerable evidence suggesting that the majority of the tapes emerged from a 1978 show at the "Hammersmith Odeon" venue in London. The Live and Dangerous Video however was recorded at a quite smaller venue "The Rainbow" theater in London also in 1978. So we are talking about different versions of songs. In addition, the album features 17 tracks, while the video features only 11. The "Live and Dangerous" video has been available on DvD for quite some years though Amazon.Jp . Indeed "Vap" video put together a release that included just the 11 track show with stereo only sound.Specific version and bonus features:This particular release features additional live video footage captured during different eras. The most highly acclaimed being the "Regal" theater gig during the Lizzy farewell tour in '83. All is expected to be in 5.1 Surround sound.Finally an additional CD is mentioned to be completing the package with unreleased (yet unidentified) material.There is a video trailer of this product in the equivalent page of Amazon.co.uk

Although famous in metal circles as the lead guitarist of "Helloween" from the late 80's to the early 00's and founder of highly acclaimed power metal band "Masterplan", Roland Grapow released two solo albums while in the ranks of "Helloween"."The four seasons of life" is Roland's debut solo album originally released in 1997 featuring fellow "Helloween" members Uli Kusch on drums and Markus Grosskopf on bass with Grapow handling all guitars and lead vocals, plus the entry of Ferdy Doenberg on keyboards. Baring the line up in mind, one could question what would be the point of a side project that features three out of five "Helloween" members. Simply "The four seasons..." is an album that draws more towards the neoclassical metal style of "Y.J.M. Rising Force" rather than the traditional Euro-power sound of "Helloween"; Having said that, the double bass attack and uplifting choruses synonymous of the German band, are recreated on "The four seasons of life".The album has drawn comments of Roland's vocals in need of further development and I have to agree; still I consider this album a total success for the artist, being the first real opportunity for Grapow to fully uncover his songwriting and guitar technique, proving himself a true master of neoclassical shred. Favorite tracks include "I remember", "No more disguise", "Sow me the way" and "Searching for solutions" (a duet with "Primal Fear" vocalist Ralf Scheepers).Overall "The four seasons of life" is a must for any fan of "Helloween" and "Masterplan" that will probably appeal to fans of neoclassical metal. A classic metal album of the 90s.

"Waiting for the sun" is the second studio album by American AOR band "Unruly Child", originally released in 1998. Six years past their debut, original members Bruce Gowdy (guitars, keyboards, bass) and Jay Schellen (drums) established a contract with MTM music for a second studio release. Joined by the admirable talents of renowned melodic rock singer Kelly Hansen (Currently fronting `Foreigner') who had served with Schellen in the `80s hard rock/glam metal group "Hurricane", the group delivered another solid lucrative proposition within the genre.Considering the six year gap between the two albums and the change in lead singer, "Waiting for the sun" is surprisingly in line with the style of their self titled debut album. It is the same mixture of acoustic rhythm guitars and keyboard layers topped by electric guitar leads while supported by a rather reserved rhythm section. Clearly "Waiting for the sun" is a vocal-driven album and for that matter relies very much on the performance of Kelly. Hansen is at the forefront of every composition on this album and make most of the songs memorable, shining even brighter during the verses and choruses.Though perhaps somewhat obscured by its predecessor, "Waiting for the Sun" was an admirable effort by the second mark of "Unruly Child" which still holds its own in the contemporary AOR scene, even though not quite the classic.

"Witch dance" is the second album by "Last Tribe" the band led by guitarist Magnus Karlsson ("Allen-Lande", "Primal Fear") originally released in 2002. On this album Magnus reunites with "Last Tribe" vocalist Rickard Bengtsson while featuring new entries bassist Dirk Lowgren and drummer Jaime Salazar (Karlsson's bandmate in "Midnight Sun").The song-writing on "Witch dance" is very similar to Karlsson's other projects "Starbreaker" and "Allen Lande", for that matter. In comparison to the "Last Tribe" debut, the neoclassical element has been substantially reduced while the progressive nature of the group has come even more to front; the riffs, choruses and overall instrumentations have a more progressive feel to them, still nothing complicated to compromise the album's directness. And "Witch dance" is first and foremost a solid heavy metal album.On a personal level, I do prefer the approach of the first album which leaned more towards neoclassical metal yet one appreciates that "Witch dance" offers just as many standout track as their debut, clearly proving its point. The haunting "Messenger", the positive "Bring out the brave" and the extra melodic "Dreamer" perfectly portray the quality of the album. Overall "Witch dance" is still a fresh sounding album, nine years past its release while being substantially differentiated from its predecessor, demonstrating its unique identity.

"Humanimal" is the third studio album by the Swedish American melodic hard rock band "Talisman" originally released in 1994, probably not the best of years for melodic hard rock; still "Talisman"s invnetive technical/melodic sound had established a considerable following in Europe and Japan that perfectly justified the making of a third album. The line up features lead singer Jeff Scott Soto, bassist Marcel Jacob, guitarist Fredrick Akersson and new entry drummer Jamie Borger (who had joined the band in the tour that followed the release of their second album "Genesis").Now, "Humanimal" or "Humanimal Pt1&2" ,as often refered to, is the result of various different tracklists of the same album for each geographical market; there had been over four differnt tracklists of the album, each adresed to a different market. All those songs were eventually collected in two CDs titled "Humanimal pt1" and "Humanimal pt2" and the 2003 version reviewed here is a two disc release including both parts (note the circular note on the top left of the cover).Over the years hard rock enthusiast/journalists/fans have argued as to whether "Humanimal" or its predecessor, "Genesis" was the best studio effort in "Talisman"s career. Despite the rhetorical queston, one has to objectively point out that "humanimal" is the most complete "Talisman" album ever, featuring 22 songs of technical, groovy, distorted, melodic and catchy hard rock that esily stood the test of time. Favorite tracks include "D.o.a.p.s.", "Seasons", "Lonely world", "Humanimal" and "Animal ritual"."Humanimal" captures "Talisman" at their artistic and productive peak and along with the preceding album "Genesis" have layed the foreground for all things technical melodic hard rock.

"Human Clay" was a project put together by "Talisman's" core Jeff Scott Sotto and Marcel Jacob. This package includes their only two albums along with additional bonus tracks. In these albums vocals are done by JSS, guitars and bass by Marcel Jacob and drums by "Talisman" guest Jamie Borger.The evidence above would suggest this being a second rate "Talisman" we are talking about. It is not the case; free from deadlines and label restrictions, at the time, the guys manage to deliver solid songwriting and outstanding performance (even with the rhythm guitar parts and solos). At parts the music flaws so naturally that it surpasses "Talisman" (unbelievable but true). The only let down in this case, especially with the first album, is the production. Sure mixing and mastering is clean and clear but it seems as the drum sound did not come out as expected from a hard rock band.

"Rage" is a German heavy-power-thrash band that emerged during the early 80s led by bassist-vocalist-composer Peavey Wagner. Besides "Helloween", "Rage" is perhaps the sole band that can claim to be, if not the father, the co founder of Power Metal. Still, they are rarely recognized as such mainly because their sound was never 100% typical power metal, rather integrated with thrash, heavy and progressive elements."End of all days", originally released in 1995, is the most straightforward approach the band ever took musically: Simple song structures (Riff, main body, bridge, and chorus) while the lyrics are surprisingly concentrated on the exploration of common emotions, particularly love. Although this album stands out as the black sheep of the "Rage" family (due to approach), when one leaves aside stereotypes, can as well enjoy a great record. The guitar riffs (Spiros Efthimiadis) are inspired and stimulating, delivering a somewhat dark- erotic atmosphere while the drumming (Chris Efthimiadis) is sustained in such way that delivers a deep, satisfactory sound. Finally Wagner's vocals are emotional and straight to the point. By all means a great album; even when listening to the album for the first time you might get the feeling that songs such as "The end of all Days", have chart quality and could as well become metal hits, (potentially at least).

This is the self-titled debut solo album by American guitarist/songwriter Kane Robets originally released in 1987. Fresh from the ranks of shock rock legend Alice Cooper with whom he recorded two albums "Constrictor" and "Raise your fist and yell", Kane was offered a solo deal with "MCA records".This debut album effectively verifies that beyond his stunning physique, Kane is a guitar master, accomplished songwriter but above all, a visionary of hard rock. By playing the album any number of times one realizes that the man understood perfectly what 80s hard rock/glam metal should stand for. And his music definitely portrays an impressive analogy of melody and attack-music-wise, romanticism and violent sexuality-lyric-wise.Kane handles all guitars, keyboards and lead vocals, undoubtedly a guitar hero moving effortlessly from speeding riffs, to melodic soloing, to furious shredding. He is also a capable lead singer while his singing on this debut is especially macho (his singing style would become all the more melodic/AOR in the albums that would follow). Drums are performed by Victor Ruzzo, while fellow bodybuilder Steve Steele plays bass, in addition Kip Winger is credited of co-writing a couple of the songs with Roberts.Favorite tracks include "Triple X", "Women on the edge of love", "Too much" and "Full Pull". Overall Kane's debut summarizes perfectly the musical and visual extravagance of 80s hard rock and hair metal; its honesty, glamour and shamelessness make "Kane Roberts" a classic 80s rock album.

"World upside down" is the 5th studio album by US melodic hard rock group "House of Lords" originally released in 2006. "World up side down" is the second studio effort of the band since their reformation in 2004. On this album only front-man James Christian remains from the original line up, recruiting great guitarist Jimi Bell and drummer B.J. Zampa along side Jeff Kent who handles keyboards and bass.Despite the changes in line up, "World upside down" turned out to be the best, or one of the best" albums in the "Lords" catalogue. The album for that matter demonstrates great song-writing as well as intense performances and it is this combination that makes "Word up side down" a melodic highlight. Foremost James puts on a really dramatic performance, delivering classic choruses namely "These are the times" and "Field of shattered dreams" which are amongst the most infectious he has ever written, Bell turned out to be quite the guitar shredder ideally combining melody and speed in his playing while Zampa's detailed drumming intensifies the overall performance.It would be fair to say that "World upside down" was the first in a series of three superb melodic hard rock releases followed by "Come to my kingdom" and "Cartesian Dreams", that sounds just as thrilling five years past its release. Absolutely essential melodic hard rock album.

No surrender is the second album by Finnish neoclassical guitar master Lars Eric Mattsson originally released in 1989. From his debut album "Eternity" Lars had established himself as one of the most competent shredders and composers within the neoclassical metal genre causing direct comparison to the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony McAlpine and Chris Impellitteri.As most would expect, "No Surrender" is a step ahead in the course that commenced with "Eternity"; this time Mattson has the bombastic big drum/guitar sound (a must for all metal acts during the late 80s) while becoming more image conscious and embracing, up to a certain point, the glam metal image.Once again Mattsson offers a set of fantastic songs including straight ahead hard rock tunes such as "Lady Luck", furious up tempo tracks namely "Since love died" and of course his trademark progressive- melancholic versions of "Just to survive", "Chasing Shadows" and the flamboyant "Wild and Free".Mattson reemerged in 1989 with a full time band, trade mark image and a powerful 15 track set/album. Even if "No Surrender" does not stand as his best work it is definitely the most complete and satisfactory output to date.

"Cry Havoc" play overblown melodic hard rock in `80s fashion with a strong AOR-essence; Imagine all the instrumental melodies of "FM" and "Heartland" turned to eleven, vocals similar to "Winger" and "Only Child" all complemented by a no-nonsense rhythm section. Indeed is as hard and as melodic as the genre can offer, demonstrating maturity on the song writing and arrangements and refined aggression in the performances.To say that the guys are passionate about their music would be an understatement as they deliver track-after-track melodic hard rock hymns as if their lives depended on it. "Cry Havoc" are pros in every sense of the word, delivering far more than one would expect from a melodic hard rock outfit. "I'll be there", "Better coming", "Rescue me" and "No way out" are flawless melodic slices totally indicative of "Cry Havoc"s musical class."Fuel that feeds the fire" was to be the only studio album by "Cry Havoc" as the group disbanded while putting down demos for their second album (which were released in 2010 under the album title "Caught in a lie"). Still it would not be an overstatement to claim that the music of "Cry Havoc" is more relevant today, in the resurgence of melodic rock, than it was a decade ago.

Finally reissued is the third album by American arena rock/glam metal band Quiet Riot. It is everyone's knowledge that "Quiet Riot" was the first metal band to top the billboard charts in 1984 with their US debut album "Metal Health" subsequently selling over ten million copies. The follow up album "Condition Critical" of 1985 is arguably their second most renowned album having sold a remarkable four million units. Still few would go as far as to mention their third album titled "III", released in 1986.Musically "III" is an even more polish "Quiet Riot" than the previous two outing, with a clear adult orientation compatible with radio-play. Clearly the artistic objective for the quartet in 1986 was to write lengthier choruses and more melodic guitar lines, which from an AOR fan's perspective is never a band thing. In addition keyboard presence has increased dramatically, establishing presence on each and every song on the album.One could theorize that this artistic transition became easier with bassist Chuck Wright entering the line up (replacing Rudy Sarzo) joining lead singer Kevin DuBrow, guitarist Carlos Cavazo, and drummer Frankie Banali; Chuck Wright had performed on the platinum debut by melodic rock/AOR group "Giuffria".Though an often underrated album, one can not see how any fan of `80s rock could go wrong with such songs as "Twilight hotel", "The wild and the young", the opener "Main Attraction" the incredible power ballad "Still of the night" and the potential mega hit "Slave to love". On account of the above one feels that the audience should give this reissue a chance, never forgetting that even back in the day "Quiet Riot III" did manage to sell a million copies.

`Frontline' is a German melodic hard rock/AOR/Glam metal band that emerged during the early-mid 90s and `The state of rock' is their debut album. Along with other Eurpean acts that debuted at the same time such as `Fair Warning' and `Lionsheart', `Frontiline' was mainly addressed to the Japanese market which would continue to demonstrate demand for the particular genre of bands.The group consists of lead singer Stephan Kaemmer, guitarist Robby Boebel (who also plays keyboards on the album), bass player Thomas Riess and drummer Stephan Bayerlein.Undoubtedly we are looking at one of the greatest AOR/Hard rock albums of the 90s for a number of reasons: Being recorded during the 90s the album naturally demonstrates more advanced sound production than albums recorded during the 80s.In addition the songwriting is based on incredible melodic guitar lines including impressive leads and shredding solos, evidently outweighing the keyboards. Equally important is the fact that despite coming from Germany, `Frontline' follows the American AOR/melodic Hard rock approach as the material is heavy and melodic but not harsh or fast. In addition their lead singer also demonstrates very melodic and clean vocals and shines wonderfully when accompanied by the backing vocals.Every song on this album is very well practiced and clearly differentiated from the rest, therefore avoiding that repetition of melodies that many albums suffer from. Favorite tracks include the climactic `Heaven Knows', the thumping `Endless', the super melodic `Another love' the aggressive `Dangerous game' and `Victim of madness'.`Frontline' would come to release more albums through the 90s and 00s and reform in 2009 under the band name `State of Rock' with Tony Mills as their new front man.

This is the debut album of German melodic hard rock band S.I.N. (Somewhere into nowhere) originally released in 2003. I had come across this release a good number of times over the previous years but something about the cover artwork did not exactly fit with the `hard rock' classification that the `MTM' record label gave the album; Eventually I bought the album-(today that is) and I am totally "awesomized" by both the material and the performances of `S.I.N.'.A fantastic lead vocalist in Jason Marks with nearly identical vocal capabilities and style to Glenn Hughes, a really heavy hitter that is drummer Alex Hlousek and the fascinating lead guitarist team of Wolfgang Frank and Deddy Andler. It does not take more than the first track to prove that `S.I.N.' exceeds the expectations of the most demanding melodic Hard Rock enthusiast.Imagine power-hard rocking compositions topped by incredible vocal performances and just when the huge chorus is seemingly over, colossal guitar harmonics, melodies and shredding storm through the speakers. I understand that my description is theatrical but there is no other way of describing the powerful melodic hard rock eruption that `S.I.N.' is. Essentially this is top quality- extra catchy material, performed with unmatched intensity while also leaving room for plenty guitar-based virtuosity (melodic and extreme in its own right!)I can not see how this album could disappoint any fan of the melodic sound; on the contrary, it seems that the `S.I.N.' debut is tailor made to satisfy even the most demanding hard rock fans. On a personal level this album was a total surprise... I am still amazed...

"Sunstorm" is the AOR/melodic hard rock project built around iconic singer Joe Lynn Turner and this is their debut album of 2006 put together by "Frontiers Records". On "Sunstorm" Joe is backed by a German-hard rock line up featuring "Pink Cream 69" members bassist Dennis Ward and guitarist Uwe Reitenauer along with drummer Chris Schmidt and keyboardist Jochen Weyer.Music-wise "Sunstorm" draws considerably upon `80s "Rainbow" recapturing a great deal of that vibe while being substantially heavier. With Dennis Ward producing this debut you can expect a really thick yet transparent output of up-front guitars, harmonious keyboards and robust rhythm section. The vocal harmonies are also more extensive than the ones found on Turner's solo albums making for intense verses and climactic choruses.Songwriting-wise Joe co-writes the first two songs of the tracklist "Keep Tonight" and "Fame and Fortune" yet the majority of songs are written by "Survivor" mastermind Jim Peterik. Really there is no filler on the "Sunstorm" debut, but standouts would probably be "Keep Tonight", "Strenght over time", "Night Moves", "Danger of love" and the immense power-ballad "Another you". Overall "Susntorm" is a very cohesive and authentic AOR/melodic hard rock offering bringing together some of the greatest names of the German and American scene on this remarkable debut.

1987 debut solo album by Italian guitar virtuoso Alex Masi (reissued in 2002). It would be fair to say that through his lengthy career, Masi has received credit not only for his technical proficiency on the six string instrument but also for his ability to compose direct and memorable melodic metal/hard rock songs.It would be no exaggeration to suggest that the material on `Fire in the Rain' sound fresh and relevant more than twenty years past their release and continue to inspire: Apart from the melodic/shredding solos, which are the inescapable must for any neoclassical metal album, Masi puts much greater emphasis on his riffs and rhythm guitar parts which sound unconventional but catchy at the same time. On that count you will be incredibly hard pressed to find a saturated or typical guitar line on this album.Beyond the subject of guitars, the lead vocals are also considered crucial for the appeal of this album: Lead singer Bernie K. does not rely upon the high pitched vocal that is so characteristic of the genre, instead he follows the hard rock (even glam metal/poser rock) singing style which makes for huge choruses, emotional verses while also being tailored to match the guitar riffs and rhythm parts.Finally the rhythm section of Chris Marxx (b) and Dave Brown (d) which fluently support the band through standard temp tracks such as `Rock your soul' to the speeding `Daybreak' to the mid tempo magic of the title track.Being perceived by one as classic I could not highlight the album's greatest moments as all 9 tracks prove themselves as equally relevant; yet the ones that left the greatest impression on me were probably `Fire in the Rain', `Rock your soul' and `Nothing to loose'Above all, `Fire in the rain' does not prioritize guitar virtuosity at the expense of the compositions and overall performances; instead it is perfectly balanced between the two. For fans of `YJMs Rising force', 'Impellitteri', `Nitro' and `Mattsson' this is another classic to add to your collection.

"Resurrection" is the debut solo album of the `Metal God' Rob Halford originally released in 2000. A highly acclaimed release, "Resurrection" marked the singer's return to the classic heavy/speed metal the very styke that he forged during the 70s, 80s and early 90s."Halford" coming out of the US, featured guitarists Metal Mike Clasciak and Patrick Lachman on guitars, bassist Ray Riendau and drummer Bobby Zarzombeck. One has to objectively identify that this line up was one of the best musical crews the metal God has ever worked with. Beyond their technical ability, the two guitarists have managed to collaborate perfectly on this debut exchanging shredding and phrases during the solos and perfect synchronization on the twin guitar melodies and riffs; Metal Mike for that matter was the very definition of the up-and-coming American guitar hero. On the other hand Bobby Zarzombeck is a drummer that needs no introduction having served US metal and hard rock since the 80s. One has to also comment that `Resurrection' is one of the greatest vocal performances of Rob Halford as he explores his trademark high pitched vocals and making extensive use of his mid-range singing.While most would agree that "Resurrection" follows the same musical direction the iconic "Painkiller" album of `Judas Priest', I would add that there are traces of other `Priest' records such as `Defenders of the faith' and `Ram it down' due to its melodic essence. I would say that `Ressurection's greatest achievement is the combination of heaviness, speed, melody and large choruses making it a superb album on all counts. `Resurrection' 10 years past its release, is still blast of amazing meta; The furious `Resurection' and `Cyberworld', the autobiographical `Made in hell' and the harmonious `Temptation' and `Nightfall' all timeless material.

"World in your eyes" is the second personal album by American AOR singer Robert Fleischman, originaly released in 2002 by Frontiers records resuming a solo career put forward in the late 70s.Fleischman is mostly known for briefly fronting "Journey" in 1977 and while also being a part of the `80s-early`90s glam metal scene as the frontman of Vinnie Vicnent's "Invasion". On "World in your eyes" Robert returns to the melodic rock sound through which the singer made his debut in the industry. His allies on this effort are guitarist Josh Ramos ("The Storm"), bassist Marvin Sperling, drummer Richie Onori along with Kell Hansen ("Foreigner", "Hurricane") who produces the album and provides harmony vocals.Now, it has to be clear that "World in you eyes" is a substantially guitar driven album with Ramos being just as much a leading figure as the singer. The guitar parts are thick and up-front delivering a plethora of Josh's characteristic melodies and riffs. Robert makes use of his mid to bass vocals somewhere between Steve Perry and Kevin Chalfant, clearly avoiding the high pitched singing style he used on "Invasion".In terms of songwriting the album is in line with the works of "Two Fires", "The Storm" and post-millenim Journey. In fact the title track and "The Crush" are powerful melodic hard rockers while eqally interesting is the groovy "Only room for one" and the optimistic "Just one Kiss". Still the album's greatest moments are probably found on the slower songs "Worlds aren't enough" and "Over my head", the latter alone make the whole album worthwhile an AOR masterpiece at its own right. Overall "World in your eyes is an ideal purchase for fans of "The Storm", "Two fires", "Ramos" and of course "Journey".

"Prism" is the debut solo album by American AOR vocalist Jeff Scott Soto originally released in 2001. This particular version is a 2009 re-issue of the album by "Frontiers Records", the label through which it was released in the first place. Beyond its original eleven songs, this new version features six bonus tracks two of them being live versions of Jeff's hits "Stand up" and "4U". The release also features two pages worth of line notes from Soto going retrospective on the initiative and the making of "Prism".It is important to note that Jeff verifies fans' initial suspicions that "Prism" comprised of songs the singer had collected over the years which were not necessarily addressed to AOR audiences. Indeed the album opens on the outstanding melodic rocker "Eyes of Love" but develops into an unexpectedly diverse collection bringing to font elements of funk, blues and soul music which, despite the rocking production, do not perfectly fit in the AOR/melodic rock genre.Regardless of the above, "Prism" remains a landmark for AOR in the new millennium as well as a bright classic for the "Frontiers" label; If you are a fan of Jeff Scott Soto and his bands like "Eyes" and "Takara" you probably have "Prism" in your collection already.

"Ignition" is the second studio album by American melodic rock project "Two Fires" originally released in 2002. "Two Fires" is the collaboration between singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos both of which collaborated on the highly acclaimed "Journey" side-project "The Storm".Those familiar with the respective solo and side projects of Ramos and Chalfant have probably come to expect a similar craft of melodic rock/AOR to that of leading band of the genre "Journey". Josh for that matter has a very distinct, though undeniably melodic, style of playing while Chalfants is one of the most experienced vocalists in the genre.Though often obsured by the "Two Fires" debut, their second album "Ignition" features substantial adult oriented compositions in the flamboyant title track, the classic as-it-gets lovesong "More than a mystery", and the stylish groove of "I see red". Significant are also the inclusions of the Perry-like ballad "This night" and "The mind I want to be" which has the vibe of "Whitesnake"s "here I go again".In terms of production, "Ignition" receives criticism for its stereo quality though the recordings and mixing seem to be faily done, the mastering is found to lacking in fact causing to sound rather un-polished; which should not be that much of an issue overall.

"Reach" is the 8th studio album by AOR/melodic rock band "Survivor" originally released in 2006 breaking an 18 year absence from discography. The line up features iconic front-man Jimi Jamison, founder guitarist Frankie Sullivan, drummer Mark Droubay, bassist Barry Dunaway and keyboardist Chris Grove.Despite the intervening years "Survivor" manages to pick up from where "Too hot to sleep"(1987) left off. "Reach" very much carries the essence of a Jamison-fronted "Survivor" therefore holding few surprises to those familiar with the particular line up of the band. As many have pinpointed, "Reach" bares the absence of keyboardist and songwriter Jim Peterik even so, the album lacks none of the musical elements that defined them throughout the 80s. Melodic keyboards, flamboyant guitar, reserved rhythm section and powerful melodic vocals. And one still gets the impression that Jamison is indeed the protagonist performer of the band.While being a relevant and authentic sounding "Survivor" album, "Reach" lacks that one standout power-rocker in style of "Burning heart" or "Eye of the tiger" that previous albums feature; one also expected a slightly harder edge to the album with more up tempo rockers as "Reach" features equal amounts of standard tempo tunes and ballads. Favorite tracks include "Fire makes steel", "Give me the word" and "Don't give up".Overall, a great addition to the collection of any AOR/melodic rock fan that is still waiting for its successor, five years past its release.

Having released two studio albums and a live package under the band name of "Blue Murder", guitar legend John Sykes deemed a change of brand name necessary, also coinciding with a new management approach as the "Sykes" albums that would follow, would be marketed mainly in the Japanese market. Still the line up on this first "Sykes" release is the same that cut the previous two albums "Nothin' but trouble" and "Screaming Blue Murder", featuring drummer Tommy O'Steen and bass-master Marco Mendoza.Originally released in 1995, "Out of my Tree" could arguably be regarded as the best, or most complete, album in the "Blue Murder/Sykes" catalogue mainly because the guitarist/vocalist revisits all rock subgenres he represented in the 80s and early 90s. Though a daunting task, the guitarist/vocalists has proven himself time and time again an extraordinary songwriter and an equally stellar performer, also being backed by such a versatile rhythm section making the creative possibilities endless for the trio."I don't wanna live my life like you" is the up tempo rocker in good "Blue Murder" tradition its narrative and provoking lyrics becoming the tip of the spear. If you ever need love is a brilliant "Whitesnake"-like ballad featuring such stimulating vocal and guitar harmonies as "Is this Love"; while "Black days" is the mid tempo melodic opus in the style of "Crying in the rain". "Soul Stealer" sounds as if taken out from the "Blue Murder" debut, built on inventive groove and lyrics. There is also "Do or die" a direct reference to John's NWOBHM days, a no-nonsense speedy rocker with extra rebellious lyrics.Overall "Out of My Tree" peaks in both songwriting and performance while also standing as John's most diverse album to date. Long term fans of the guitarist who have followed his career from "Tygers of Pan Tang", "Thin Lizzy" "Whitesnake" and "Blue Murder" are expected to make the most of this stellar work.

I first heard about `Negative' a few years back, on Amazon.jp. The band is a glam metal outfit from Finland which have enjoyed considerable success in their home country and Japan in particular so I was intrigued to get a hold of their work; Unfortunately, I never came across any of their albums in stores- that is until today!"Anorectic" (2006) is the band's third studio album and the second album to reach number one at the Finnish charts. Although their sound is unmistakably metallic, featuring thick rhythm guitars, forceful lead vocals and lead guitar parts in no shortage, the album benefits from a very polished production bringing to front some very subtle and melodic keyboards and minor orchestral arrangements.Although it is generally accepted that glam metal bands are represented better by rough mixing, in the case of `Negative' the polished sound works to their advantage; a fact that becomes clear when one concentrates on their slower songs where the listener comes to appreciate the clarity of the string instruments, not to mention that it makes the end of the song even more climactic.The `Anorectic' line up features vocalist Jonne Aaron, guitarists Larry Love and Sir Christus, bass player Antti Anatomy, drummer Jay Slammer and key player Mr. Snack.Another very positive attribute of `Anorectic' is that the latter part of the album is all the more aggressive and electric moving further away from the radio friendly rock sound that probably characterizes the first songs of this release. Favorite tracks include `Planet of the sun', `Sinner's night', 'Stop f@cking around' plus slower/climactic tracks `Song for the broken hearted' and `Embracing past'.So this is rather straightforward; if you enjoy modern glam rock/metal, `Anorectic' is a very promising album.

"Scratch and Bite" is the debut album by Swedish melodic hard rock/glam metal band "Treat", originally released in 1985. The line up features lead singer Robert Ernlund, guitarists Andres Wikstrom and Leif Liljegren, drummer Mats Dahlberg and bassist Ken Siewertson.With a sound somewhere between `80s "Kiss" and "Def Leppard", "Scratch and Bite" would lay the foundation for a string of "Treat" albums through the mid `80s to the early `90s. "Scratch and Bite" is a fair mixture of melodic rockers and glam metal tunes. It is rather easy to make out the adult oriented rockers from the rock'n' roll glam songs, on this debut.Though "Scratch and Bite" is built to `80s standards baring up-front rhythm-section, harmonious keyboards, melodic guitar lines and AOR-like vocals, the overall performance is far from flamboyant, contrasting fellow Swedish acts like "Europe" and "YJM Rising Force". You will be hard pressed to find extensive shredding guitar solos, double bass attack or intense drum fills. Clearly "Scratch and Bite" was a perfectly radio friendly album for the biggest part with melodies and choruses never getting too challenging for the average listener. From a melodic rock fan's perspective, one finds that it is the more adult oriented material that work best for "Treat" on this first album such as "Get you on the run", "Hidin" and "No room for strangers".

"The ritual" is the debut album by Swedish melodic metal band "Last Tribe" originally released in 2001 and put together by guitarist extraordinaire Magnus Karlsson. The guitarist had made his recording debut with the band "Midnight Sun" in 1999 and while retaining his position, chose to form his own melodic metal outfit "Last Tribe" which found home on the "Frontiers records" label.The line up of "The ritual" features Magnus on guitars and keyboards, singer Rickard Bengtsson, drummer Kristoffer Andersson and bassist Par Wallmark. Seven out of ten songs are written entirely by Magnus Karlsson as he would soon be recognized as one of the top composers in melodic metal having composed such albums as "Kiske Somerville" and the "Allen-Lande" trilogy. In terms of direction the style of "Last Tribe" does not deviate from the approach Karlsson's other works namely "The Codex" and "Midnight sun", with the exception of an underlying neoclassical element that is found on "The ritual" being the main point of differentiation for the album. Favourite tracks include "Black Widdow", "Blood on your hands", "Spellbound" and "Ready for the storm"."The Ritual" would be the first of three albums released by "Last Tribe" before Magnus Karlsson would move forward artistically, undertaking a variety of projects by "Frontiers" and other record labels; if you are a fan of the works and projects mentioned above, you will probably enjoy "The ritual" to the fullest.

"Khymera" is a melodic hard rock project released under "Frontiers records" aiming to bring to front some of the latest talents of the Italian melodic rock scene while fronting the project with an authority in the melodic rock genre. "A new promise" is the second album by "Khymera" originally relesed in 2005.This time multi instrumentalist Daniele Liverani undertakes Keyboards and bass, passing lead guitar duties to young guitar prodigy Tommy Ermolli while drums are once again performed by Dario Ciccioni. Yet the real surprise is the project's new front man; non other than Dennis Ward- most recognize the German rocker as the bass player for "Pink Cream 69", one of the main songwriting forces of "Frontiers records" and master producer for a variety of rock and metal acts, still one would not quite picture him as a lead singer. That is until "A new promise". In fact Dennis is stricktly the lead singer and he does a phenomenal job on the album, the man had kept hidden an incredble mid range AOR voice which -dare I say-reminds one of Jeff Scott Soto.The album features original material along a couple of cover versions of "Jeff Scott Soto" and "Unruly child". The majority of the album is composed by the songwriting team of Tom and James Martin who have since become key contributors to the songwriting of most projects issued by the particular record label. In retrospect "Khymera- A new promise" turned out to be a very surprising a musical alliance that effectively managed to stand the test of time thanks to stellar songwtriting and amazing performances throughout its thirteen tracks.

`Lordi' is the Finnish shock hard rock band probably known as the metal group that experienced the greatest popularity boom in recent history within the European market, literally becoming superstars overnight. Having established themselves as recording artists since 2002, the band was chosen to represent their home country in the annual European POP song contest `Eurovision' of 2006 (held in Athens, Greece that year). The band was set to perform the track `Hard Rock Halleluiah' from their latest at the time, 3rd album `The Arockalypse'. And it won! Most European countries voted in favour of `Lordi' placing them in the first position, with the rest following far behind.Without doubt the 10th of May 2006 will be remembered as the metal celebration of the European metal community; and the track `Hard rock Halleluiah', as glorious as it sounds, perhaps was not all that amazing or, put more accurately, was not the strongest track on `The Arockalypse'.`The Arockalypse' was perhaps the most 80s oriented hard rock album of 'Lordi' and despite the monstrous (yet catchy vocals) featured the biggest choruses than any other hard rock album of that year. Beyond that, the guitars are thick on the riffs and unexpectedly technical during the leads (including twin guitar melodies and shredding). In addition the keyboards add the very essence of 80s AOR to the album making the opening riffs so exciting and the choruses even more climactic. Finally the rhythm section is totally metal with a huge-as it deserves- production.I have to admit that there are very few albums released in `00s that were as infectious as `The Arockalypse'. Summing the recipe of their success? big song openings straight to the point lyrics, mega choruses, at to that loads of melodic guitar and there it is!Furthermore this special edition of the album including the original 12 songs plus re recorded versions of 3 of their older tracks is the REAL DEAL; NON STOP HARD ROCK HEAVEN absolutely no fillers allowed on this monumental album! And very honestly, to this day songs like `Good to be bad', `Who's your daddy', `Now it snows in Hell' and `Would you love a monsterman' are amongst my favourite hard rock tunes of all time.A true monument of Hard Rock."Metal Hammer" Greek magazine (issue 259) marks this album with 7/10 commenting: "Old school 80s hard rock to the bone in the style of Kiss, Alice cooper, WASP and Twisted sister"

This album was my introduction to the music of melodic hard rockers `Shylock', since becoming one of my favorite German bands of the genre; "Welcome to illusion" is their 3rd album originally released in 2004. "Shylock" actually a significant number of trademarks of German hard rock that often bring to mind better known bands of the genre, still their technical and composing ability often surpasses these glorified bands.Immediately one identifies that the album is hugely produced with tremendous rhythm section and extra thick rhythm guitars. The vocals are very reminiscent of bands like "Bonfire" and "Jaded Heart"; finally there is also a very melodic essence to the band as guitar leads harmonize with the vocal melodies reaching the very definition of melodic hard rock. Overall one could claim that "Shylock" is considerably heavier than the average melodic hard rock band, yet that is to be excepted as German hard rock, for its biggest part, is recognized for being somewhat heavier that the international scene. Never the less, the album's melodic lines, catchy choruses and very polished mastering are bound to make "Welcome to illusion" a rather easy listener even for non hard rock fans.The line up features the incredible vocal talents of Matthias Schenk, powerhouse guitar team of Johannes Lohr and Stefan Appel, the robust rhythm section of Helmuth Welther and Steven Wussow plus the melodic contribution of key player Matthias Appel.The particular release holds 15 tracks, all being exceptional pieces of melodic hard rock, very well planned, ideally executed and perfectly produced. There are no fillers on the album, nor anything that could be considered as unnecessary or uninteresting. Favorite tracks include "Welcome to illusion", "Closer", "But I like it", "Middle of paradise", "Lose you", "Guilty" and "Hard to hold on".Overall "Shylock-Welcome to Illusion" is an exemplary melodic hard rock album that introduces new quality standards for the genre in terms of songwriting, performance and production. A guarantee for any fan of melodic hard rock and an absolute must for fans of "Bonfire", "Jaded Heart", "Frontline" and "S.I.N.".

2004 reissue of the debut album of poser hard rock/glam metal band `Axia' (1988). Hailing from Sweden, `Axia' consisted of lead singer Peo Pettersson, lead guitarist Morgan Blomquist, bass player Niclas Ericson and drummer Michael Alexandersen. This reissue includes the 10-track self titled album plus 4 additional songs taken from their 1985 MLP.Although the band very much fits in the glam/poser genre of the 80s their sound borrows a lot from early 80s AOR as far as melodies and song structures are concerned: Although `Axia' includes a good amount of direct party rockers such as `It ain't love', `On my way' and `Increasing action' their advantage lies on mid tempo tracks such as `Loser' and `Falling Apart'; these are monumental performances in their own right as the atmosphere and emotion overwhelm the listener.The performances are flawless throughout the album and you can expect to find large choruses occasional twin guitar harmonies and a fair amount of keyboards that intensify the AOR element in the sound of `Axia'.Overall, if I had to relate their sound to another band that would be `Joshua' specifically their debut `The hand is quicker than the eye' as it is filled with the same intensity emphasizing the more dramatic moments of the album.For fans and collectors of 80s AOR, hard rock and glam metal this is another release that, for its biggest part, stands the test of time.

"Livin' on a dream" is the 7th studio album by American melodic rock singer Robin Beck originally released in 2007, her second album under "Frontiers Records". Having re-established herself as a leading force in female-fronted melodic rock with her previous album "Do you miss me", Robin teams up with James Christian ("House of Lords") and Swedish guitarist/songwriter Tommy Denander for another forceful AOR statement.In contrast to the previous album Robin co-writes the majority of songs on "Livin' on a dream" along with Christian and Denander and the occasional inclusion of external songwriters. Furthermore the guitars are once again the protagonist instrument, this time providing the majority of instrumental melodies.The most significant improvement in comparison to the previous album is clearly the production, handled by non other than Dennis Ward ("Pink Cream 69"). So we are looking at a much thicker sound while the mixing process ensures that no instrument is left in the background. The rhythm section is finally up-front making the experience more intense and the album more enjoyable. "Show me the way", "Love me like a man", the substantial ballad "Always" and the superbly melodic "Seventeen forever" are totally indicative of the quality of a surprisingly well-rounded AOR album."Livin' on a dream" is easily one of Beck's best albums, clearly comparable to her classic records such as "Trouble or nothing" and "Human Instict". This album features just about anything you would expect from a solid female-fronted AOR/melodic hard rock album.

"Nemesis" is the third album by Swedish melodic metal/hard rock band "Midnight Sun", originally released in 2001. The band founded by bassist Jonas Reingold and singer Pete Sandberg brings brought on board new members guitarist Magnus Karlsson and drummer Jamie Salazar.The musical direction of `Midnight sun' definitely leans towards the more technical side of melodic metal/hard rock due to inventive rhythm section; for that matter Jonas Reingold's bass style comes very close to that of Marcel Jacob preferring arpeggios and bass melodies over typical bass lines. In addition "Ressurection" marked the debut of guitarist extraordinaire Magnus Karlsson who would later go on to write, record and play for some of the biggest names in melodic metal; and on "Resurection" he has every bit the technical ability and imaginative songwriting that he is recognized for today. Pete Sandberg has a very subtle/melodic vocal style that never gets aggressive, proving particularly effective on the slower songs and very fitting on the neoclassical melodies.The more one plays this album the more one realizes how much musical substance each song bares; for that matter it is really easy to overlook this release, still the strength of the songwriting and performance grants `Nemesis' timeless appeal to fans of melodic metal. Songs like `You and I', `Conqueror' and the amazingly melodic `King of broken hearts' ballad will bring you back to `Nemesis' time and time again, always discovering something new with each play.

"Solo" is the AOR debut album by "Planet 3" vocalist Cliff Magness, originally released in 1994. Often regarded by melodic rock enthusiasts as one the top AOR albums of the `90s, "Solo" brought to front subtle songwriting/performances leaning more towards the west-coast sound than melodic hard rock.This debut album is effectively a "Solo" offering as Cliff handles the biggest part of the production, recordings and instrumental performances, beyond his characteristic vocals. Specifically the singer handles drum programming and keyboards plus bass and additional guitars. Lead guitars are contributed by Jay Graydon while Glenn Ballard complements keyboards.Clearly "Solo" is a keyboard-driven album and although one finds fair amounts of flamboyant lead guitar, rhythm parts are kept to a minimum mainly found in the verses and choruses of the songs. In addition drumming for its biggest part has been programmed, slightly undermining the album's quality overall, as one can easily make out that the rhythm base of the compositions are mainly samples. On a personal level, one finds the harder songs on the album more appealing, in particular "If we can't do it", "It's only love" and "Jenny's still in love".Overall the Magness debut is a quality AOR album of the mid-90s proving that Cliff is more than capable of utilize the absolute minimum of resources and still deliver high quality work. Fans of west-cost, AOR and subtle melodic rock should definitely try the Cliff's "Solo" album.

"Into the street" is the second album by Canadian AOR band "Boulevard" originally released in 1990, reissued in 2010 by "Metal Mind Productions". The line up has remained fairly consistent since their 1988 debut, featuring lead singer David Forbes, guitarist Randy Gould, keyboardist Andrew Johns, saxophonist Mark Holden plus the new rhythm section of Tom Christiansen and Randall Stoll.Technically "Into the street" provided a considerable departure from the sound of their debut "Blvd". The guitars have been brought to front carrying riffs, rhythm parts and sharing the melodic lines with the keyboards while saxophone leads have been substantially reduced and the bass takes a complementary role (though just as technical as before, indeed a key factor to the appeal of "Boulevard"s sound). One happily finds that the new rhythm section re-creates the intense, largely produced rhythm patterns found on their debut, being a big part of the "Boulevard" identity; furthermore Forbes once again becomes the tip of the spear, carrying all the core melodies impeccably crafting stellar melodic moments as "Where is the love" and "Lead me on".Other highlights on "Into the street" are the groovy-melodic "Crazy Life" the bass-driven "Where are you now" and the climactic "Eye to eye". Somewhat harder-sounding that their debut, "Into the Street" provided a faithful continuation of the "Boulevard" sound delivering in the process even more memorable radio-rockers which should appeal to seasoned as well as younger fans of melodic rock.

"Desperate Business" is the debut album by the "Brian McDonald Group" originally released in 1987, reissued by "Yesterrock" in 2010. The line up features singer/songwriter Brian McDonald (who also handles keyboards on the album), guitarist Will Hodges, drummer D.W. Adams and bassist Andrew Wilkins. It is also important to note that all lead guitars and most of the rhythm parts are performed by guitar legend Reb Beach ("Winger", "Whitesnake").Though commonly regarded as an adult oriented rock album, "Desperate Business" brings to front a much thicker and more up-beat sound, which combined with the flamboyant production, make for an arena-rock album-the term providing a more accurate description of their style. Indeed "Desperate Business" is built on the principles of American melodic rock/AOR, yet with such huge drum sound, blinding melodic guitar lines and shredding solos plus some of the loudest and longest choruses of the time, this is all too far from the subtle radio-friendly AOR of the `80s.Even though a guest/session musician, Reb Beach fires on all cylinders and, to a certain extent, steals the show with his technical, but undeniably melodic, lead guitar work. Brian Mc Donald for his part proves a more than competent lead singer carrying all the vocal harmonies and loud choruses while retaining intensity levels throughout the album. Favorite tracks include "Just Imagination", This Lonely Heart", "No Control", "Everynight" and "Back home again". If one was to compare the sound of "Desperate Business" with a better known release that would be "Winger II". Fans of 80s party rock, arena rock, along with AOR enthusiasts should make the most of Brian McDonald's debut.

"Runway to the Gods" is the latest `Zeno' album to date, originally released in 2006. For those who are familiar Zeno's previous works, the man is nothing less than a musical genius; having put out such albums as the definitive "zenology" and the absolutely unsurpassable "Listen to the light".So how can Zeno follow an album which is arguably the peak of composing, performing and recording creativity? Simply by going back to melodic Hard Rock basics with "Runway...". It has to be clarified that this release does not have the overall rock opera texture (the orchestra, the multiple guitar layers, the theatrical vocal performances) ; Instead Zeno concentrates on his stellar lead guitar work, dynamic drumming smooth bass lines and really active keyboards. Non the less, the wizard has an ace up his sleeve in the name of Michael Bormann. Amongst the top two leading Melodic Hard rock voices in Germany, Bormann (ex Jaded Heart, Bloodbound, Redrum) sings throughout this fantastic album."Fanfares of love", "Climb the sky", "Refugees", "I feel, I live", "Land of illusion" are masterpieces of Pomp AOR/Melodic Hard Rock. While it would have been easy for the composer to recreate the formula of "Listen to the light" (a mega seller in Japan) Zeno verifies with "Runway..." that he is by no means restricted by any rock idiom while remaining adamant in not making the same album twice.

"Indiscreet" is the debut album by leading British melodic rock/AOR band "FM" originally released in 1986, just reissued by "Rock Candy Records". As with most "Rock Candy" releases, the material has been re-mastered to perfection making the album clearly superior to previous CD transfers.Though it is uncommon for "Rock Candy" to feature anything more than the original album, the "FM" debut is loaded with extra material beyond the standard 9-track album. This re-issue features a total of 27 tracks including the "Indiscreet" album plus BBC outtakes of songs, extended versions, live performances along with two studio tracks that were not featured in the original pressing."FM" as most are aware, rank amongst the brightest examples of UK-bases adult oriented rock and "Indiscreet" does absolute justice to their status. Infectious keyboard harmonies, crystal clear guitar melodies and unforgettable choruses make "Indiscreet" a classic of the melodic rock genre, bringing to front such highlights as "That Girl", "Love Lies Dying", "Hot Wired' and the unsurpassable "I belong to the night".Overall one could have not have asked for a better re-issue than this one and perhaps for many fans this is a dream-come-true package that not only extends the album but also polishes the diamond to the greatest extent. If you are a fan of adult oriented rock and `80s radio-rock you can not go wrong with "Indiscreet".

"Native Sons" is the second album by British-American AOR/melodic rock group "Strangeways" originally released in 1987, re-issued by "Majestic Rock" in 2003. The line up features guitarist Ian Stewart, bassist David Stewart, drummer Jim Drummond and American vocalist Terry Brock."Native Sons" takes the basis of radio-friendly AOR and induces inventive riffs, melodic guitar lines and flamboyant solos. Keyboards are also a big part of the album, much like the bass, ever-present yet complementary to the overall sound of "Strangeways" rather than driving the songs. Of course one has to appraise Brock's vocal performance, bringing to front a powerful and very clean singing style, easily one of his best recordings to date. Clearly the vocal melodies on "Native Sons" would prove a challenge for just about any singer, mainly due to their length and quick succession.The re-mastering effort is also a huge plus for the particular release, granting these recordings depth and clarity which rarely comes out from re-touched seasoned tapes. You can pick any song on "Native Sons" and you get a melodic rock classic on the spot. Form the stylish opener "Dance with somebody" to the powered-up "Where do we go from here", to the aggressive "Stand up and shout" it is all authentic, substantial `80s melodic rock, never forgetting the immense power ballad "Goodnight LA". Overall if you are a fan of `80s rock and AOR/melodic rock in particular you simply can't go wrong with this remarkable album.

"Nikki Puppet" is a female fronted poser hard rock band from Germany. "Militant Mother" is their second album originally released in 2007. The band consists of girls Nicky Gronewold (vocals) and Anke Sobek (bass) and boys Florentine Adolf (drums) and Christos Mamalitsidis (lead guitar).As predictable as poser hard rock is considered, "Militant Mother" has quite a few surprises in store for fans of this genre; First and foremost the production is nowhere near the average poser album- the guitars are super thick, brought up front in the mix for some real rock mayhem. Evidently choosing power metal grand master Herman Frank ( "Accept", "Victory") to produce this album was a wise move, as he turns the whole album up to 11! with guitars taking a leading role through metallic riffs and technical solos.On that note, "Nikki Puppet"'s aggression extends beyond the label "Poser rock", unmistakably referencing the protestant/revolutionary themes of early "Warlock" and "Twisted Sister". Ideal examples of their attitude are the power track "Lights are out" and the bombastic "I don't know". Never the less, the band has not failed to demonstrate their melodic side with "Turning Circles" while also throwing in a potential radio hit in "Paltry".Overall this is one of the most diverse poser rock albums currently out there, moving from aggression to tenderness while also taking a shot at the mainstream. A definite must for poser fans and hard rockers.

`Zeno' is the musical outfit of guitarist/songwriter Zeno Roth (younger brother of the legendary Uli Jon Roth). His technical ability matches perfectly that of his brother while he is also keen on writing multiple layer music, often incorporating orchestral arrangements in his latest works. Despite being as talented as his brother Zeno never deviates from the musical subgenre he serves which is melodic hard rock which he takes to an outstanding level.Zeno's international recording debut came with their self titled album released in 1986 but for various reasons would not see a follow up for some time. Never the less the absence of Zeno led to the formation of highly acclaimed melodic hard rock band `Fair Warning' led by Zeno bassist Ule Ritgen.In the mid 90s `Zeno' re emerged as a recording artist and went on to release a string of high selling melodic hard rock masterpieces for the Japanese market: `Zenology' (1995), `Listen to the light (1998) and `Runway to the gods' (2006).This release entitled `Zenology II' is a much needed album for fans as it bridges the gap between Zeno's debut and his reemergence in the mid 90s. Specifically the album collects recording captured between 1983 and 1989 while being effectively re mastered, therefore demonstrating thick rhythm section, killer guitar sound and perfectly clear vocals. For those experienced in `Zeno's music it is perfectly understandable that `Zenology II' as any of his other albums could not be anything less than amazing.Focusing on the differences this album demonstrates in comparison to Zeno's other releases, one identifies the guitarist's lead work taking a slight neoclassical twist at times while Ule Ritgen's bass playing brings Zeno a step closer to the sound of `Fair Warining'. Unfortunately singer Michael Flexing does not make full use of his amazing vocal capabilities instead he follows a playful/glamorous singing style which is to be expected as these performances were captured throughout the 80s.Overall `Zenology II' is a must for any fan of `Zeno', `Fair Warning', `Dreamtide' and for anyone demanding their rock to be extra-melodic.

"Zeno" is the debut album of guitarist Zeno Roth (brother of legendary Uli Jon Roth) originally released in 1986. Guitar-wise it would not be an exaggeration to claim that Zeno's style is practically identical to that of his brother; in terms of songwriting/musical approach "Zeno" comes closer to the 80s oriented melodic rock/hard rock. "Zeno" also brought to front musicians that would develop into prime forces of German melodic hard rock including singer Tommy Heart (`Fair Warning') bassist Uwe Ritgen (`Fair Warning', `Dreamtide') and vocalist Michael Flexig.The consistent members of this debut are Flexig, Ritgen and naturally Zeno. The music is definitely up lifting melodic hard rock with emphasis on spirituality and pictorial lyrical themes which more than establishes the potential of the three basic members. For that matter you can expect super melodic guitar leads and stylish chords, Ritgen's trademark bass playing and Flexing's immense choruses; still as a sign of times, Michael sings incredibly high on the majority of the album therefore not making full use of his incredible range (which he uncovers on the follow up `Zeno' albums).Despite its artistic validity and alignment to the trends and stylistic approaches of the time, `Zeno' would be the only album released by the guitarist in the 80s; subsequently the outfit would go in hiatus for the following seven years. Of course "Zeno" would re emerge in the mid 90s with iconic melodic albums "Zenology" and the unsurpassable "Listen to the Light" both of which would become big sellers in Japan. Still all credit due to this debut for bringing to front some of the most colorful personalities that German melodic rock would ever produce.

Guitarist Zeno Roth is the younger brother of German master composer- guitarist Uli Jon Roth (ex "Scorpions", "Earthquake", Solo). Zeno much like his brother, is an extremely competent guitar player and composer only he separates himself through following a Hard Rock /AOR path rather than the neoclassical operatic style of his brother."Zenology" is his second solo album originally released in 1995 (1994 for the Japanese market), a timely follow up to his 1986 debut. For the experienced Zeno fans this release stands as his most direct rock album with little or no use of orchestra."Zenology" offers straight ahead power AOR/ hard rock songs such as "Heat of Emotion", "Surviving the night" and "Out in the night" deliver tons of emotion with soaring vocals and guitars, while downbeat song such as "In the Dark" and "Man on the Run" ooze class while verifying that Zeno's abilities can not be patronized.It seems that for the musicians involved, every Zeno album stands as a challenge to push their creativeness beyond standard levels delivering monumental performances in the process.No exaggeration here, "Zeno" is by all probability the most competent statement the genre had to offer during the 90s. On a personal level I am not satisfied with this review as it fails to portrait accurately how incredible this album is."Zeno" is faultless perfection; Emotion, Composition, Performance and Production are heavenly blended here in their most uncompromising form.

"Move on" is the 8th and latest to date studio album by British melodic hard rock group "Heartland" originally released in 2005. "Heartland" is a seasoned band in the ranks of AOR/melodic hard rock having debuted in 1991 and having since been consistent in their releases.The style of "Heartland" places equal emphasis on melodies and grooves, being a well rounded musical entity. In terms of sound, the band comes incredibly close to American melodic rock heroes "Mr Big". For that matter lead singer Chris Ousey bares identical vocal to that of Eric Martin while guitarist Steve Morris places emphasis on groovy riffs while topping them with catchy melodic lines which further references the US super-group. On the other hand the rhythm section, although up-front in the mix, puts on a rather reserved performance while effortlessly going through a variety of grooves and tempos on "Move on".Overall you can expect ever present guitar riffs and melodies, large choruses and a plethora of guitar solos; in addition the presence of acclaimed producer Tommy Hansen in the mixing and mastering in away guarantees attack thickness and clarity on "Move on" . Indeed, the more one plays the album, the clearer it becomes that "Heartland" comes closer to the American AOR sound instead of the European-favourite tracks include "Where do we go from here", "Hard-hearted man", "City of lights" and "Getting ready".

2005 release from the band "Terra Nova"; led by the Hendrix brothers, (Fred (V) and Ron (K)) "Escape" is a very fine AOR/melodic rock album that goes way beyond the obvious. How is that? Well the album is at its biggest part very up beat, the guitars are rock solid and instead of the heartache clich&eacute; that you will probably find in the majority of AOR albums, "Escape" oozes confidence.With the line up completed by Gesuino Derosas (G) Eric Coenen (B) and Hans Eijkenaar (D) the album provides no shortage of AOR power tracks: "Rock Bottom", "Hold the line", "Escape" and the definitive "lonely is the night". "Long Live rock'n roll" and "War on War" are fully qualified radio hits that should have taken the rock clubs/venues by storm (provided there was any justice).And I play "Long live rock `n roll" over and over and I can honestly find no fault on it or on the previous tracks for that matter. It is solid, it is catchy, it is cohesive and it gets the message through: This is AOR to make your day.

It is very common nowadays for old school bands to reunite, tour, record new albums and probably release old unheard tapes, forgotten even by them, on CD. Well in this case legendary hard rock drummer Carmine Appice has attempted to put together early demos, alternative versions and unheard tracks of his 80's glam outfit "King Kobra", shaped into an 11- track album.One has to admit that the end result is very interesting; "King Kobra" fans will have the opportunity to hear tracks sung by Marq Torien and John Edwards as well as witnessing the dynamics of guitarist JK Northrup, giving a different flavor to the band. All this and much more under the consistent drumming of Carmine Appice, naturally present in every track.Standout tracks: "Walls of silence", "Lonely nights", "Young hearts survive" and "Redline"

"Embrace the galaxy" is the debut album by Swedish neoclassical metal project "Space Odyssey" originally released in 2003. Having disbanded his previous project "Majestic" Swedish keyboard virtuoso Richard Andersson put together his second musical outtfit "Space odyssey". Much like "Majestic", "Space odyssey" would also explore the musical genre of neoclcassical metal with Richard at the helm, yet "...Odyssey" would turn out a more collective effort than "Majestic" as all instruments here contribute equally on the song performances and focus has shifted away from the keyboards.The line up of "Space Odyssey" is also a treat- an all star line up by today's standards featuring the late great bass vituoso Marcel Jacob (ex-"YJM Rising Force", "Talisman") and vocal giant-to-be Nils Patrik Johansson ("Astral Doors", "Lion's Share") along with guitarist Magnus Nilsson and drummer Zoltan Csorsz. The songs are incredibly well developed with a certain progressive essence to them, still nothing too complicated while you get a large amount of melodies and neoclassical scales coming from the keys,guitar and bass. Never the less, it is probably Patrik Johansson's talent and overwhelming vocal attack that steals the show on "Embrace the galaxy", his performance is absolutely devastating with a style that references Dio, Tony Martin and Kal Swan. Favorite tracks include "Emposium", "Despair and pain" and "Embrace the galaxy"Overall, "Embrace the galaxy" turned out to be a surprising offering by Richard Andersson and co that should rightfully be considered a classic of the neoclassical metal genre. For fans of "Rising force", "Voodoo Circle", "Royal Hunt" and "Silent Force" this is a must!

"First Strike" is the debut album by American hard rock band "Cobra" originally released in 1983, reissued in 2008 by "Rock Candy Records". "First Strike" was to be the first and only album by "Cobra", featuring guitarist Mandy Meyer and Jack Holden, bassist Tommy Keiser, drummer Jeff Klaven and iconic singer Jimi Jamison who would go to front AOR powerhouse "Survivor".Musically, "Cobra" were substantially different to "Survivor" , essentially being a guitar driven band featuring complementary keyboards and up-front rhythm section but clearly not the flamboyant style of bass/drumming that would become popular in the following years, endorsed by melodic hard rock groups. One has to comment that the guitar leads are pretty inventive and "First Strike" does bare pretty shredding solos and twin guitar leads; yet those melodic guitar lines are rarely found within the basic song structure (opening, verse, chorus) mostly reserved to the guitar solo spot of each song.Perhaps it goes without saying that Jamison is the focal point of "Cobra" putting on a vocal performance that is very much comparable to his highlights with "Survivor". The singer carries all the core melodies of each song with the same passion and attack that made him famous the rock world over. Though putting forward a very different style of rock than what we have come to expect from Jimi since his "Survivor" debut, "First Strike" is a quality hard rock album that includes a fair share of intense moments.

"MKII" is the third album by high profile power/melodic metal band "Masterplan" , originally released in 2007. As the title implies "MKII" is the first album not to be recorded by the original line up, featuring founder guitarist Roland Grapow, bassist Jan S. Eckret, keyboardist Alex Mackenrott alongside new entries from the US, Mike Dimeo (ex-`Riot') on lead vocals and drum prodigy Mike Terrana (who has also participated on Grapow's second solo album).In retrospect, the album did not seem as a satisfactory output by such a highly acclaimed band of the genre while one could claim that was mostly due to the departure of the two original members rather than the music and the performance itself. For that matter, playing the album more than three years past its release, one would logically come to the conclusion that "MKII" is in fact in line with the sound and style of the preceding "Masterplan" albums. It is all thick guitar riffs and rhythm parts, the catchy and inventive keyboards once again serve as a differentiating factor for the band. The rhythm section is powerful, technical moving effortlessly through the various twists and turns of the album. While Mike DiMeo is objectively a singer of great melodic capability.In terms of lyrical concept "MK II" is conclusively the most positive "Masterplan" album to date, being a considerable departure from the minor-melodic-dramatic sound that defined the majority of their work. With positive melodies and vocal lines on tracks like, "Phoenix Rising", "I'm gonna win" and "keeps me burning", "Masterplan" effectively presented the `other side of the coin' to their music while keeping the basis of their sound consistent. "MKII" is actually a release of equal quality to the other three "Masterplan" albums released to date, from a line up that should have received a fair bit more credit.

`Saints and Sinners" is the second solo album by guitarist/songwriter Kane Roberts (ex-Alice Cooper) originally released in 1991. Best known for his bodybuilder physique and ability in popular metal song writing, Kane should rightfully be considered an authority in the glam metal and melodic hard rock genres.In comparison to his debut album, "Saints and sinners" is a much more melodic and slightly less glamorous collection of songs; the lyrics for that matter have moved away from the sex & violence concept to more self expressive themes. In addition Kane's macho vocals have become substantially more melodic and clear delivering a strong AOR essence to the album. The studio line-up features Kane on lead vocals and lead guitar, John McCurry on guitar, Steven Steele on bass, Myron Grombacher on drums and key player Chuck Kenits."Saints and Sinners" is definitely amongst the last great melodic hard rock albums to be released in the early 90s, riding on the success the genre enjoyed during the 80s. For that matter "Saints and Sinners" holds its own in today's musical scenery. Indeed songs like the unsurpassable "Rebel Heart", the melodic "Fighter" the overblown "Too far gone" and the hit power-ballad "Does anybody really fall in love any more"."Saints and Sinners" is a great melodic hard rock album by a criminally under-rated guitarist-singer-songwriter that effortlessly stands up to contemporary melodic rock works; and Kane Roberts will return as a live performer in late 2011.

"Live in Sweden", originally released in 2001, is a set of archive live recordings capturing Phil Lynott's solo band live in Sweden in 1983. "Live in Sweden" was the first in a series of archival recordings featuring Phil Lynott, recovered and mastered by keyboardist Mark Stanway.1983 saw the release of the last "Thin Lizzy" studio album, subsequently followed by a lengthy 1983-1984 farewell tour. Aside of the Lizzy dates, legendary frontman Phil Lynott was offered a string of solo gigs in Sweden during August 1983. On the strength of his two solo albums "Solo in Soho" (1980) and "The Phil Lynott Album" (1982), Phil put together a line up to answer the invitation from Sweden. The formation featured `Lizzy' members, drummer Brian Downey and guitarist extraordinaire John Sykes along with new recruits, guitarist Doish Nagle and keyboardist Mark Stanway.It is this line up featured on this 2-CD set, each capturing the band on a different night. So we are looking at the same set-list on both albums. The emphasis is clearly on Lynott's solo work with the inevitable addition of "Lizzy" classics. In contrast to Lizzy's melodic hard rock attack, Lynott's solo bands essentially plays AOR, hence an equally melodic, though lighter version of rock. Beyond front-man Phil, the undeniable protagonist of these recordings is John Sykes who delvers riffs, melodies and tons of harmonious shredding. You can expect the same level of performance professionalism found in "Thin Lizzy" while the recordings are perfectly clean and clear which is highly surprising as the recordings came straight from the mixing board. It has to be mentioned also that "Zoom Club records" did a rather good job in this release with a double size CD case and equally large booklet including loads of pictures and narrative by Mark Stanway.For fans of Thin Lizzy, Phil Lynott and John Sykes this is a must. If you enjoyed this release, you could check Stanway's other releases of Phil Lynott: "Grand Slam-The studio sessions"(2002), "Gran Slam-Live 1984"(2003), "Gran Slam-Twilight's Last Gleaming"(2003) and "Grand Slam-Glasgow Kiss"(2008).

"Platens" is the personal AOR/melodic rock project of Italian multi instrumentalist and composer Dario Grillo who is the lead singer, guitarist/bassist and key player on this 2005 release. Drums on "Between two horizons" are contributed by Alessandro Grillo.I did not know anything about the release before purchasing it, but "Platens" turned out to be a very positive surprise as not only is this genuine AOR/melodic rock but it's also 80s influenced suggesting fat rhythm guitars, mega melodic keyboards, ever-present key-guitar solo flamboyancy and of course huge choruses.Dario Grillo is an accomplished instrumentalist and even greater composer and these two qualities lay the basis for a memorable album; in other technical specs the album benefits from a very appropriate production (very thick and well sustained sound) while Dario has wisely added physical drum performances, instead of using the typical drum machine (which is a very obvious/common choice for AOR projects) making the sound all the more bombastic.Having played the album over and over, I could not find any weak songs/moments, however I was attracted to the faster tracks on "Platens"; the opener "Here I am" the extremely infectious "can you feel it" the rebellious "Into the fire" not forgetting the double bass drum attack and overall drama of "Angel's Cry"."Platens" is a superior AOR/ pomp melodic rock release (if I could label it as such) which apart from the relevant song writing and musicianship, has a very 80s feel/aura a somewhat rare quality amongst modern AOR releases. "Platens" will definitely not disappoint any fan of AOR/melodic rock.

"Hugo" is the self titled debut solo album of American AOR/melodic rock singer Hugo Valenti originally released in 1997. Hugo, mostly known for his late 80s melodic rock/glam metal group "Valentine", recorded this debut in Europe, England with the support of "Ten" front-man Gary Hughes who co-produces the album along with Hugo. Unlike the majority of solo AOR artist albums, "Hugo" features a stable line up throughout including Vinny Burns on guitars, Ged Rylands on keyboards/piano, Greg Morgan on drums, Gary Hughes on bass and of course Hugo on lead vocals.Those familiar with Hugo's other works identify how close his music comes to the sound of legendary AOR/melodic rock band `Journey'; and this album is no exception as it makes direct references to the more subtle and radio-friendly side of `Journey'. Still the album includes a fair amount of rocking moments such as "Crazy", the opener "We'll find a way", "All the people you love" which are also personal favorites on the album.The essence of this debut is very positive, obviously centered on the lyrical subject of love and at times going beyond that and getting philosophical. In terms of production you will probably be able to make out that the album is a 90's recording, without implying there being production flaws of any kind.Having been almost 15 years since its release, `Hugo' should rightfully be considered a classic AOR/melodic rock album of the 90's that remained true to the qualities of 80s AOR and potentially laid the basis for the resurgence of AOR/melodic rock in the 00's.

I just discovered this album by the "Martie Peters Group" released in 2005. At the time I was shopping for new releases such "Reece" and "Danger Danger". But this "MPG" album turned out to be the biggest surprise of them all. From the cover and back photos I knew this was unmistakably an AOR album; however I clearly did not expect the melodic twin guitar attack (courtesy of Martin Slot and Rene Shades) and thunderous drumming (from Jesper Werner) that hits you straight in the face, relentlessly present throughout the album.In context, the guys in MPG know how to kick start their songs with flamboyant melodies and aggressive rhythmic while concluding with a smooth AOR chorus; and this is the album's greatest advantage. In addition Martie Peters has a very fitting, for this genre, voice which is identical in sound and style to that of Mike Tramp ("White Lion").AOR fans can not possibly go wrong with this one as "MPC" has all the qualities that shape a classic melodic rock album. Songs like "Riot on the 5th floor", "Only Dreaming", "Number one", "Bird on the Wire" and "Take me over the edge" are destined to please any rock fan as they are products of cohesive songwriting and flamboyant performance.This is indeed AOR but not of the conservative kind; MPG have turned all instruments and performances up to 11! And that's the way to go!!!A must for all AOR admirers as well as White Lion fans.

At a time when iconic AOR band "Journey" was inactive, members were split amongst multiple projects some of which delivered quality works, true to the standards of the legendary melodic rock group. One of these projects was "The Vu"; formed in 1984 and led by bassist Ross Valory, "The Vu" featured lead singer Kevin Chalfant, guitarist Steff Burns, drummer Prairie Prince and keyboardist Tim Gorman.The subsequent album "Phoenix rising", recorded in 1985 was shelved partly due to the reformation of "Jounrey" for a new album and tour in 1986. "Phoenix rising" is a faithful continuation of "Journey's" "Frontiers" album. From the rhythm guitars, to the keyboard melodies, to the song structures to Kevin's vocals, "The Vu" does justice to the legacy. On the other hand the attitude of the songs on "Phoenix Rising" is considerably less dramatic and more fun-oriented that the timeless hymns of "Journey".Indeed you will be hard pressed to find a weak or bland track on "Phoenix Rising", playing the album over and over simply makes the experience even sweeter as one discovers more instrumental harmonies and becomes more accustomed to the vocal melodies. "Who you gonna believe", "Keys to the city", "If I had your back" and "Dreaming your life away" could have easily been "Journey" songs.Recorded in 1985 and released in 2000, "Phonix Rising" is one of the greatest "Journey" side projects with a sound and style almost identical to the original band. If you are a fan of this family of bands including "The Storm", "Two Fires" and "Hardline", it is impossible to be let down by this release.

"Line Up" is the third studio album by hard rock singer Graham Bonnet originally released in 1981, reissued by "Lemon Recordings" in 2004. A mere year after Bonnet quit British rock powerhouse "Rainbow", the singer was already marketing a promising single as a solo artist, the song being "Night Games".On the charting strength of "Night Games", Graham was contracted for a full length studio album, which was to be the sarcastically titled "Line Up" (since it is essentially a solo album). In retrospect "Line Up" did feature a remarkable cast of musicians with guitarist Mick Moody ("Whitesnake") and drum legend Cozy Powell ("Rainbow") being constant throughout the album.Though "Line Up" is often considered an AOR album (and for the biggest part it is), it is clearly not produced to the standards of the genre; The guitar parts are pretty rough sounding and the drumming is intense though far from over-produced. In fact "Line Up" sounds very similar to late `70s "Rainbow" hence not dissimilar to the sound found on the "Down to Earth" album. The AOR tunes in question are the Russ Ballard-written "S.O.S", "I'm a lover", "That's the way it is" and "Liar". Form there onwards the album takes a turn towards bluesy rock `n' roll on songs like "Anthony Boy", "Dirty Hand" and "Out on the Water" which should not come as a surprise baring in mind the involvement of the "Whitesnake" guitarist.Overall "Line Up" brings to front a fair mixture of late `70s "Rainbow" and early `80s "Whitensake" styled music which I suppose is all fans of the singer could ask for. Indeed "Line Up" stands artistically somewhere between "Down to Earth" and "Lovehunter".

"Baptism by Fire" is the melodic hard rock joined effort between renowned Swedish guitarist/songwriter Tommy Denander and the former voice of "Toto" Fergie Frederiksen, originally released in 2007. Beyond guitars Denander handles keyboards and bass while drums are contributed by Eric Daniel.Tommy has been a much sought after session musician both as a songwriter and guitarist, having contributed ideas and performances to some of the recent highlights of "Frontiers Records". So fans of the genre should rest assured that "Baptism by Fire" will hold its own within the genre. Fergie proves every bit the charismatic AOR vocalist delivering the appropriate tone and mood on each and every song on "Baptism by Fire" with particular standouts as the opener "Let him go", "My Saving Grace", "Keep a light on", "Dead end" and the title track."Baptism by Fire" is essentially guitar driven melodic hard rock, very much in the style of Denander's previous works featuring thick riffs, melodic solos and memorable choruses. The keyboards are also consistently present on the album, though mostly complementing the compositions by adding rather modern sounds to the arrangements.Overall "Baptism by Fire" is another stellar melodic hard rock partnership that should satisfy any long term fan of the genre, particularly those who have followed the respective works of the two musicians over the years.

"Take what you want" it the debut album by American melodic hard rock/glam metal band "Hurricane", originally released in 1985. The line up features guitarist Robert Sarzo, bassist Tony Cavazo, drummer Jay Schellen and renowned AOR singer Kelly Hansen."Hurricane" are often associated with pioneer glam metal group "Quiet Riot" since two members of each band share blood relations. The sound of "Hurricane" is actually comparable to that of "Quiet Riot" since it is based on thick riffs, memorable choruses, up-front rhythm section (with the occasional double bass drumming) and the least amount of keyboards possible.The album opens with "Take me in you arms" amongst the best up-tempo/rocking love songs written in the `80s. "The girls are out tonight" has a similar vibe to "Quiet Riot"s "Cum on feel the noise", proving a fair equivalent. There is of course the metallic "Take what you want" and the protestant hard rocker "Hurricane" which literally says everything regarding the band's orientation.One would not be exaggerating by suggesting that even though all four musicians leave their mark on "Take what you want", front man Kelly Hansen is the heart and soul of this early incarnation of "Hurricane" as few could deliver this collection of songs as convincingly as he does. If you are a fan of melodic hard rock and early glam metal you probably already have the "Hurricane" debut in your collection.

"Over the Edge" was to be the last album to feature the original "Hurricane" line up of lead singer Kelly Hansen, guitarist Robert Sarzon, bassist Tony Cavazo and drummer Jay Schellen.While most would regard "Over the Edge" a faithful continuation of the sound introduced by "Take what you want", "Hurricane" actually push the creative boundaries of their style. To begin with , the album has more musical layers than their debut; guitar riffs topped by melodic guitar lines and complemented by background keyboards. It is equally important to note that Kelly Hansen makes extensive use of his full range, experimenting on both low and high-pitched vocals, beyond his characteristic mid-range."Over the edge" is a surprising opener for an album of this kind, kick-starting on acoustic guitars only to build up into a hard rock juggernaut. "Messin' with a Hurricane" is another mega rocker where the rhythm section wages wars and the guitars shred like mad. On the other hand the slowed cover version of "I'm eighteen" does not quite hit the mark. Following is the protestant "We are the strong", perhaps the strongest moment on "Over the edge" baring incredible peaks and climactic choruses.In a sense "Over the edge" could be regarded as an experimental album (by melodic hard rock standards) where the band attempts to expand musically with various degrees of success. On certain songs it works beautifully, on others not that much, yet it should appeal to long term fans of the genre.

"Slave to the thrill" is the third studio album by American melodic hard rock/glam metal band "Hurricane" originally released in 1990. Three years past "Eye of the storm", "Hurricane" re-emerge under a new line up, featuring new entry, guitar hero Doug Aldrich (fresh from the break up of "Lion") along side founding members bassist Robert Sarzo, drummer Jay Schellen and lead singer Kelly Hansen.Once again Hansen leads "Hurricane" though another set of adrenaline-filled, riff based glam metal. Doug Aldrich manages to uncover a great deal of his heavy blues based guitar style for the biggest part of "Slave to the Thrill". The album includes such groovy rock'n'roll highlights as "In the Fire", "Young man" and "Lock me up"; never forgetting "Temptation", clearly the exception to the rule, a substantial melodic rocker with a chorus that seems to come out of their debut album.Still one can not fail to notice that the overblown hard rock attack has been compromised in favor of a more rhythmic-therefore radio friendly- style. Though the rhythm section remains up-beat on most songs, there is little evidence of the double bass attack and big toms which were a big part of the sound of the previous two albums. Fans that have followed the respective careers of Kelly Hansen and Doug Aldrich being also familiar with their musical orientation will probably make the most of "Hurricane"s third studio offering.

The second Firewind album originally released in 2003. "Burning Earth" will by no means disappoint; yet it will fall short once compared with "Between Heaven And Hell". At the time band members were deeply involved in other projects that subsequently affected the end result. The line up is set to include Gus G. on lead guitar and Stephen Frederick on vocals as the songwriting core of the band. This album also features new acquisitions in bass player Petros Christo and drummer Stian Kristoffersen.If you are about to make your first Firewind purchase we recommend that you choose their debut "Between Heaven And Hell" or their latest accomplishment "Allegiance".Nevertheless if you decide to invest in this decent release you will be rewarded by first class power/ heavy tracks such as "Brother's keeper", "Waiting still", "I am the anger" and the instrumental "The fire and the fury".

`No sugar added' is the fifth full length studio album by Dutch singer/keyboard player/composer Robby Valentine originally released in 1998. Musically the album is built on the very same melodic rock glamour that defines any R. Valentine release only `...sugar...' demonstrates some fairly up tempo material with increased emphasis on twin guitar melodies; hence one could argue that the release was probably the most aggressive (in terms melodic rock) than any of his preceding albums.For the part of the lyrics, `no sugar added' sees Valentine addressing a wide range of social issues including war (track 10 `combat'), disease (track 11- `never too late') as well as his trademark romantic/heartbreakers namely `Blinded by love'. So evidently Robby tells various and diverse stories and for the biggest part he is fairly brutal in his description hence the title `no sugar added': Best example of this approach is `Never too late' which opens by the lyrics `There is a girl, she has cancer, she's only 16 years old...'.Despite the super glamorous, fairly vain image, Robby is proven courageous, realist and unafraid of criticism touching on subjects such as war and terminal illness as easily as he sings about romance, surrealism and philosophical questioning. Favorite tracks include `Back 2 Mars', `Blinded by love' and `Never too late'.I do consider `no sugar added' as a key album in Robby's career being by far the most versatile demonstrating shocking honesty while being equally as glamorous as any of his previous (and following) works. Rocking and inspiring!

"Afterlife" is the second album to come out of the melodic rock/AOR project featuring lead singer Pau Shortino (ex-"Rough Cutt", ex-"Quiet Riot", "King Kobra") and guitarist JK Northrup (ex-"King Kobra") originally released in 2004 by "MTM Music".In comparison to the previous "Shortino/Northrup" album, "Afterlife" is more adult oriented and to a lesser extent bluesy rock'n' roll. The up tempo songs such as the opener "Here I am" and "Afterlife" immediately verify that the musical chemistry between the two rockers remains intact, though it might be true that the standard-paced songs on the album could have been further developed in terms of choruses and opening riffs.Those familiar with Shortino's vocal style should not be surprised to find out that the singer literally thrives on the melodic mid-tempo songs featured on "Afterlife". In particular the subtle "Feel Again" sounds so classic that could have been a hit; "Slave" is a much heavier tune that quickly strips itself from the thick guitars leaving the rhythm section and vocals to create the magic. Of course one could not leave out the darkened power-ballad "Gypsy Soul" with a chorus to die-for.Overall "Afterlife" is a worthwhile AOR/melodic rock album including some outstanding musical moments, which is not to say however that most compositions do not leave room for improvement. Indeed most tracks would have benefited from better arrangements and more extensive choruses, yet that does not alter the fact that "Afterlife" places its fare share of highlights on the table.

"SINNER" LIVE '95: featuring basic members of "Primal Fear", "Silent Force", "Saxon" and "Bonfire".No matter how chaotic the 90s were for Hard Rock/Heavy Metal bands and fans, they did offer a considerable number of fantastic albums that held the hard/heavy empire from falling apart.Focusing on Germany and for the live part, the most appraised albums of that era tend to be "Helloween's" "High Live" (1996) and "Gamma Ray's" "Heading for the East" (1990).Somewhere between that period Sinner put out his first and only full length live album "Live in the line of fire". An ambitious title, drawn by their latest studio release "Bottom line" (1995), was to be backed up by an all star (by today's measures) line up:Mat Sinner ("Primal Fear", "Goddess Shiva") on bass and lead vocals, Tom Newman ("Primal Fear") and Alex Beyrodt ("Silent Force") as lead guitarists, drummer Fritz Randow (`Saxon") and Frank Roessler on keys.Recorded during the 1995 European tour, "Live in the line of fire" is an absolute classic and a much anticipated reissue by hardcore fans. This is by no means predictable; Sinner does not play a "best of set", rather less popular songs (for the album's biggest part) which are taken to stratospheric level by the band's tremendous line up performance.Imagine a 1995 live album with huge guitars, persistent twin guitar melodies/harmonies, double bass beat drums and extensive solos. Undoubtedly a combination unlikely to come by in the mid 90s. But how does it hold up against today's vast Hard Rock/Metal Scene? It might lack (just by a fragment) in terms of production compared to this decade's live albums still it is by far the most uncompromising recording reissue.From a collector's perspective this is an incredibly hot documentation of how powerful 90s music could have been (potentially). No matter the circumstances, Mat Sinner has always delivered!(This reissue also includes 4 bonus live tracks recorded in 1985, quite possibly the earliest live recordings of "Sinner".)

"Demo Anthology", as the title suggests, is a collection of demos by the highly acclaimed US hard rock/glam metal group "Winger" originally released in 2007. This release is a 2CD set featuring a total of 37 demo songs recorded during the late 80s in between their three classic albums ("Winger", "II" and "Pull"); so you can expect demo versions of songs from all three album plus a total of ten previously unreleased song.Considering the time these tapes were produced, the demos are of high stereo quality and make for an enjoyable two CD set for any fan of the band or 80s hard rock in general. So what sets these demos apart from the official versions? Well as bassist/vocalist Kip Winger explains on the back sleeve notes, the majority of these demos, if not all, were recorded solely by lead guitarist Reb Beach and himself where the two musicians would play their respective instruments while drums were programmed on a drum machine. In addition the presence of keyboards is somewhat reduced in comparison to the official versions.On the other hand, one finds the guitar to be the protagonist instrument on these recordings, making the demos sound much heavier than the official material. In addition Kip's vocals come out in a more forceful manner delivering more hard rock attack while remaining technically impeccable.Overall "Winger-the demo anthology" is a complete as it gets package featuring 37 tracks including 10 previously unheard songs. So the release serves both as a fan item as well as an introduction to those new to the music of "Winger".

Hard to be a Rock'n Roller is the debut album by Norwegian glam metal/melodic rock group Wig Wam originally released in 2005. At that time Wig Wam's mission statement was to revitalize glam metal as a genre and re-introduce `80s rock into the new millennium. The line up featured seasoned musicians of the genre who undertook nicknames; Glam (Age Sten Nilsen) on vocals, Teeny (Trond Holter) on guitars, Flash (Bernt Jansen) on bass and Sporty (Oysten Andersen) on drums."Hard to be..." effectively established "Wig Wam" amongst the leading forces- if not the leading force- in European hair metal bringing to front such party rock as "Bless the night", "No more living on lies", "The best song in the world" and the hit single "In my Dreams". Beyond the great songwriting which brought to front infectious grooves, unforgettable choruses and stimulating guitar melodies, each member proves an authority in their respective instrument. Age's vocal range works miracles on the tracklist altering his tone and vibrato effortlessly between songs; equally important is the contribution of Holter who is indeed the shredder on six-strings balancing speed and melody with admirable precision.And it is that combination of stellar performances and to-the-point songwriting that makes "Hard to be..." such a joy to play over and over, more than seven years past its original release. No question, the "Wig Wam" debut is a contemporary classic of the glam metal genre that holds its own no matter the comparison, clearly a highlight in rock overall.

"Night of White rock" is the 6th studio album by Christian German hard rock band "Mad Max", originally released in 2006. "Mad Max" is the premiere Christian rock band to come out of Germany having debuted in 1982; with a history that goes as back as the early 80s it should come as no surprise that "Night of White rock" sounds very much like German outfits "Bonfire" and "Jaded Heart".The line up features singer/guitarist Michael Voss (Gary Barden, Paul Sabu), lead guitarist Jurgen Breforth, drummer Alex Kruse ("Jaded heart") and bassist Roland Bergman.In fact "Mad Max- Night of white rock" is guitar oriented melodic hard rock mostly falling into the characteristic German rock sound while on the softer, perhaps mellow, tunes the influence of American AOR is evident; best examples in this case are "Hope to see you" and "Unbelievable". Still it is probably the heavier and faster melodic rockers that make "Night of white rock" a memorable album, namely "To hell and back again", "Sun", "Homeless" as well as the title track .In retrospect "Night of white rock" is a complete proposition in white rock, proving that the band have retained their vision and songwriting intact despite their seven year absence from the scene. For fans of Christian hard rock and white metal "Night of white rock" is the ideal proposition that lacks nowhere-the riffs, the melodies, the choruses and the speed are all here.

"Speak of the dead" is the 17th studio album by German heavy/power metal band "Rage" originally released in 2006. "Rage" is credited amongst seasoned fans as one of the first metal acts to engage a full orchestra in their recordings and "Speak of the Dead" probably stands as the most symphonic album in their catalogue.The established line up of bassist/vocalist Peavy Wagner, virtuoso guitarist Victor Smolski and drum prodigy Mike Terrana deliver a set of songs in the classic "Rage" formula: Heavy riffs, melodic choruses, strong guitar harmonies, unconventional grooves and blinding solos; the orchestra contributes equally to the compositions delivering basic melodies, taking a leading role rather than just adding to the musical background of the release. Beyond that the tracks that are credited as instrumental on the back cover are actually spots where the orchestra performs on their own.Having played the album over and over the past three years I have to comment that it really bares timeless material. Songs like "No regrets", "Soul survivor" and the title track are masterful compositions regarding arrangements and performance yet the album goes a step further offering metal masterpieces in "Innocent" and "Beauty"."Speak of the dead" is indeed a masterpiece of Symphonic heavy metal, perhaps redefining to a certain extent the genre and what one can create within its boundaries. Sadly this was the last studio album of "Rage" to feature Mike Terrana behind the drum kit. A definite must for any fan of symphonic metal, power metal or heavy metal.

Debut album from American guitarist vocalist Katherine Thomas, originally released in 1987. A mix of glam and thrash metal that stands as the total opposition to what is know as "Thinking Man's metal". Exaggerating vocals, childish lyrics, undisciplined guitar shredding, and very little cohesion within song arrangements. If you are very serious about your music this album is very likely to stand as an insult to your intelligence, still if you have already heard/collected just about every 80s metal record you could consider buying this. This is so ridiculous that it's almost fun."Power Play" magazine (issue 94) marks this album with 2/10 commenting: "Her vocals are absolutely diabolical; her playing is sloppier than a Dutch blwjb... Avoid like the plague my friends"

In 2003 `Europe' members Mich Michael(k) Ian Haugland (d) and John Leven (b) decide to form an AOR/melodic rock project at a time when their original high profile band was in hiatus. For that cause they recruited German ex-`Fair Warning' guitarist Andy Malecek and Swedish lead singer Mikael Erlandsson (previously a solo AOR artist in the Japanese market).The musical direction of "Last autumn's dream" (2004) is considerably differentiated form the artists' original bands. There is no big tom `Europe' drumming nor the overblown guitar leads of `Fair Warning' with the overall performance being much more subtle than the hard rock these musicians are identified by.Still the `LAD' debut is nothing but filled with huge choruses, melodic guitar phrases that blend perfectly with the magic keyboard work and of course the stellar performance of Erlansson make the release a standout from the majority of AOR albums. To be totally honest I had followed the careers of the musicians involved in `LAD', and was totally aware of their abilities yet I did not expect their debut to be that good. Favorite tracks include 'Again and Again', 'Doin' time' and 'Break the chains'.In terms of production it has to adressed that the album sounds very organic in the sence that it does not rely on overdubs or multiple musical layers which make the poerfromance relaxing and powerful at the same time while the melodic essence is never sacrifieced in favor of heavy rhythm."Last autumn's dream' would come to be the debut of an AOR supergroup that has since been releasing a new album each year. As of 2010 `LAD' have released 7(!!!) studio albums and a live CD, and it seems that there is no slowing down for this AOR powerhouse.

"Light this city" is the debut album by Portuguese AOR/melodic rock band "Faithfull" originally released in 2003 and reissued in 2009 by American label "Perris Records" which specializes in the AOR/Glam/Sleaze genres. The line up features lead singer Sergio Sabino, guitarist Rui Martins, drummer Sergio Ramos and bassist Nuno Ledesma.In terms of direction, "Faithfull" comes closer to the sound of a Paul Laine solo album: Standard tempo tunes for the biggest part, extensive melodic guitar solos, a mixture of clean and distorted guitars, totally AOR rhythm section; yet above all it is Sergio's voice that bares incredible similarity to that of American melodic rock hero Paul Laine making "Faithfull" a dream for any experienced AOR/melodic rock fan.There is a fair number of ballads on "Light this city" yet it is probably the heavier material such as "You won't get me now" and "Melting your ice" that would be considered as highlights; never forgetting harmonious tunes like "There's no turning back", "learnt my lesson", "The way I am" and "Light this city". No doubt "Faithfull-Light this city" is a substantial, if not original, melodic album honestly delivering great AOR and being very successful at that.Indeed "Light this city" serves as the ideal summer album for AOR enthusiast that sounds fresh and vibrant, definitely leaning towards American melodic rock. Just about every song has Air-play potential.

"No.1" is the debut album by Swedish melodic hard rock/glam metal band "M.ill.ion" originally released in 1991. Having established a firm presence in melodic hard rock over the past five years, the story of "M.ill.ion" goes actually back to the late 80's at which point they were a more glamorous outfit still just as melodic and hard rocking. The line up features lead singer Hasse Johansson, guitarists CT Rohdell and Stefan Wetterlind, bassist BJ Laneby, keyboardist Markus Ydkvist and drummer Roland Christoffersson.The sound of "M.ill.ion" is built on bombastic guitars, melodic keyboards, big drumming and dynamic choruses. I would say that "No.1" draws elements from both the American and European school of melodic hard rock/glam metal sounding very much like a mixture of "Bangalore Choir" and "Europe". One also has to address that "No.1" is a totally uncompromised hard rock record with no shortage of guitar shredding/solos and drum fills (which would often be reduced on albums of that period).It is also important to note that the quality of "No.1" does not slip at any of its 12 songs, all having memorable choruses and infectious opening melodies. Personal favorites include the classic `Sign of Victory', "Lovers", "Live it or leave it" and "Hold me, touch me". Overall the "M.ill.ion" debut is a great choice for fans of "Europe", "Bangalore Choir", "Lion" and "Lionsheart".

"Book of the dead" is the second album by Swedish power metal band "Bloodbound" originally released in 2007. "Bloodbound" are often characterized as blackened power metal due to their corpse-paint image on their earliest photo shoots and devil-centric themes. While the band image has moved away from black metal, their fascination with the biblical concept of the devil is ever-present. Having said that, the lyrics seem to be based on stories of the Bible, being mostly narrative rather than expressing opinion or picking a side.The line up features established "Bloodbound" members Tomas Olsson and Henrik Olsson on guitars, bassist Fredrik Bergh, drummer Pelle Akerlind with new-studio only entry- iconic German singer Michael Bormann. While the singer is mostly known for his melodic rock/AOR works, his adaptability is very much in favor of the band and fronts this effort flawlessly delivering the appropriate heavy/power metal tone.Beyond vocals, the album features a totally devastating rhythm section that manages to sound interesting throughout the album while the guitars retain a fair balance between riffs and melodic lines, both in no short supply. Still "Bloodbound"s greatest advantage is found on their choruses; you really can not forget choruses like "Sign of the devil", "The tempter" and "Book of the dead" and this is indeed a memorable album. Overall, a very strong power metal album with fairly dark orientation that succeeds in living its mark, no doubt.

"Alligator" is the second and latest to date solo album of American guitar hero Brad Gillis, originally released in 2000 by "Frontiers" records. Brad Gillis, an established guitar prodigy having served as Ozzy's axeman in 1981 while also enjoying mainstream success throughout the 80s as a member of AOR/ melodic rock sensation "Night ranger"."Alligator" released at a time when "Nightranger" were inactive featured beyond the guitarist, "Nightranger" drummer/vocalist Kelly Keagy and lead singer Gary Moon who had sung on the band's 1995 album. So apart from being a Gillis solo album, "Alligator" could easily be categorized as a `Nightranger" side-project. Still the overall sound is not quite the typical "...Ranger" style; For that matter the album is strongly guitar oriented while leaving the polished AOR sound for a thicker, totally hard rocking production.There is an emphasis on guitar riffs and solos as well as choruses, being a huge plus for the album. On "Alligator" Brad uncovers a great deal of his technique, vibrato based shredding/soloing proving once again a genuine talent of the instrument. In particular I would go as far as saying that the song "Eyes" has one of the greatest guitar solo ever throwing impossible vibrato harmonics and speeding melodies. Other strong melodic hard rockers are "Circle of light" and "Heart shaped wings".Overall "Alligator" is a must for "Nightranger" fans as well as enthusiast of hard rock guitarist/songwriter albums like Gary Moore,John Sykes Kane Roberts and Paul Sabu.

"Starfire" is the debut solo album by Norwegian rock/metal singer Jorn Lande ("Ark", "Masterplan") originally released in 2000. Under the guidance of "Frontiers records", Jorn records a solo debut with half of its tracks being cover versions of classics of "Journey", "Foreigner" and "Deep Purple" amongst others.So, in terms of approach, "Starfire" has very little to do with the progressive metal of "Ark" or the power metal of "Masterplan"; instead through this debut Jorn explores pomp melodic hard rock, being the musical style that defines the release. Those familiar with the man's music are probably aware that beyond his vocal charisma, the Norwegian singer has the ability to reinvent each and every song he covers, and in this case delivers powerful versions of such classics as "Burn", "Edge of the blade" and "Break it up".Although limited, the original material on "Starfire" stand as a good indicator of the musical style that Jorn's solo career would follow in the coming years. For that matter the self titled track is the debut's greatest moment and one of the greatest songs the singer has ever come up with delivering drama, romanticism and attack, all emanating from Jorn's ever-dynamic performance. Overall "Jorn-Starfire" is a top pomp melodic release, holding its own over ten years past its release.

"Circles" is the 8th and latest to date studio album by German melodic hard rock band "Frontline", originally released in 2006. "Frontline" is commonly recognized as one of the most capable bands of the genre to emerge during the mid 90s bringing to front an AOR sound produced in the thickest way possible.It might come as a surprise how much "Frontline" look up to the American melodic hard rock/AOR sound. In fact, lead singer Stephan Kammer comes from the Steve-Perry/"Journey"-school of vocals demonstrating the same subtle and melodic style. In addition, Bobby Boebel's guitar playing is built on extensive melodies in the style of "Whitesnake" and "Vinnie Vincent Invasion". The line up also features Rami Ali on drums and Thomas Bauer on bass.A couple of days ago I managed to get a physical copy of "Circles" which is considerably hard to find, and it turned out to be just as good as their preceding releases. Still, this time "Frontline" went a bit further from the thick-catchy- melodic rockers to deliver a potential AOR hit in the incredible "It is you" (track 9), an absolute standout song by all standards.Overall "Circles" turned out to be another great installment in "Frontline's" 10-year career and while it might not cause the same level excitement to the listener as their 1994 debut, it brings a fair amount of relevant melodic rockers to the table while remaining faithful to the musical identity of the band.

"Night of crime" is the second studio album by American melodic hard rock band "Icon", originally released in 1985. "Night of crime" signified a critical turn in "Icon"s career as the band moved from the heavy metal of their debut to a glamorous melodic hard rock approach similar to the styles of "King Kobra" and "Vinnie Vincent's Invasion".The line up features lead singer Stephen Clifford, guitarists Dan Wexler and Joun Aquillino, drummer Pat Dixon and bassist Tracy Wallach. Without any exaggeration this line up of "Icon" proved one of the most technically accomplished synergies in mid- `80s melodic hard rock. The level of musicianship is something else which combined with powerful-sexually driven songwriting nearly touch the absolute in `80s hard rock. The warning of "Danger calling" the romantic-dramatic "Shot at my heart", the protestant "Raise the hammer", the raging "Whites of their eyes", and the predatory anthem of "Hungry for love".Stephen Clifford is every bit the melodic hard rock voice managing intensity and precision complemented by a vocal range that makes everything possible. The guitar formation delivers everything form shredding, to melodic guitar lines to twin guitar solos plus a rhythm section that witches from speeding hard rock double bass drumming to subtle AOR beats. If you are a fan of intense and colorful `80s melodic hard rock, you probably have "Icon"s second album already in your collection.

Although most would consider "Brave the storm"(1985) as the debut album by British melodic hard rock band "Shy", "Once bitten twice shy"(1983) is their historic debut originally released in 1983. The recording process of "Once bitten..." only lasted two weeks from what was originally meant to be a number of demo-versions, "Shy" cut eight songs, enough to be considered a full-length album.The line up of lead guitarist Steve Harris, bassist Mark Badrick, drummer Alan Kelly and key-player Paddy McKenna was joined by singer Tony Mills who was initially meant to serve as a session vocalist but would become a full-time member and perhaps the focal point of "Shy". It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that "Once Bitten..." holds some of "Shy"s best even songs making it possibly their greatest album ever. "Shy" takes the attack and intensity of NWOBHM and mixes it with the melodies and feeling of American AOR. Guitars and keyboards exchange rhythm parts and melodies, the rhythm section moves subtle beats to double bass attack and Mills sings like his life depended on it.The only objective downside of this album is it production; The recordings sound fine and the mixing is appropriate therefore it is probably the mastering that is hinders the release; the album sounds rather thin and lacks depth-the louder played the more obvious its limitations. Still the inspiration, the technique and the performance is so evident that overshadows the engineering aspects, making it a five star melodic hard rock album. "Shy-Once bitten twice Shy" indeed verifies that nothing beats a talented young rock band.

"Break out", originally released as "False metal" is the debut album by Finnish AOR/melodic rock band "Brother Firetribe" of 2008. "Brother Firetribe", quite the supergroup of the Finnish scene features guitarist Emppu Vuorinen ("Nightwish"), lead singer Pekka Heino ("Leverage"), bassit Jason Flinck ("Kings of modesty"), key player Tomppa Nikulainen and drummer Kalle Torniainen."Breakout" wastes no time at all, convincing from the opening bang of the title track that "Brother Firetribe" mean serious business with their brand of arena-AOR. Extra large choruses, melodic keyboard-guitar mayhem and totally 80s-rhythm section is the recipe that makes "Breakout" a highlight of the contemporary AOR genre. In retrospect it would be fair to claim that "Breakout" brought to front modern AOR classics in "Valerie" "I'm on fire" and "Midnite queen", effectively establishing "Brother Firetribe" as a credible melodic rock band rather than just a side project for the Finnish metal elite. One still finds surprising how focused, consistent and true to the values of 80s AOR, "Breakout" is. For that matter, one has to give credit to the musicians for choosing melodic rock to express themselves while they could have safely put out a symphonic metal album aligned to their original bands.This reissue features beyond the original ten tracks, two B-side songs a "Dio" cover of "Hungry for Heaven" and the promo video of "One single breath". An absolute must for fans of AOR; The current resurgence of Adult oriented rock indeed owes a lot to this first "Brother Firetribe" album.

"Out to every nation" is the 3rd solo album by Norwegian rock/metal singer Jorn Lande originally released in 2004. The album marked the singer's collaboration with a new label, "AFM" records resulting to a much heavier release than the preceding two. On this album Jorn recruits members of "Pagan's mind" guitarist Jorn Viggo Lofstad and drummer Stian Kristoffersen along with `Hamerfall' bassist Magnus Rosen and key player Ronny Tegner.Taking into account that the album is written collectively by Lande and Viggo, it should come as no surprise that "Out to every nation" leans towards progressive metal rather than the pomp/melodic rock side of the previous two albums. Indeed the emphasis is placed on riffs and grooves instead of melody, still the choruses, and all vocal parts are once again characteristically Jorn. One has to also address that "Out to every nation" featuring superior production qualities to the preceding albums including the thickest guitars and drums.On a personal level, i have to comment that I prefer the melodic side of Jorn's solo music while acknowledging that the album carries substantial metal tunes including the title track, "Vision eyes" and "Rock spirit". Overall "Out to every nation" is a great addition to Jorn's solo catalogue that references directly his progressive metal origins being his heaviest work up to that time.

After his triumphant comeback in speed/heavy metal with his solo debut `Resurrection', Halford would follow a somewhat different musical direction on this second album, still never deviating from heavy metal.On "Crucible" the guitars are down-tuned delivering an even thicker presence than its predecessor while the overall tempo has been dropped considerably as the album comprises of standard and mid tempo songs, rather that speed metal formulas that have become synonymous of `Judas Priest' and Rob Halford. The lyrical concept also deviates from the expected futuristic/hero-oriented themes that have become somewhat of a trademark for the singer. On the contrary it seems that "Crucible" draws more on spiritual or even religious topics quoting conceptually early `Priest' albums like "Sad Wings of destiny" and "Sin after Sin".The line up has remained unchanged on this second album featuring guitarists Pat Lachman and Mike Chlasciak, drummer Bobby Zarzombeck and bassist Ray Riendeau.Indeed "Crucible" is one of the heaviest albums in Halford's entire career. And while there are songs referencing the previous album like "One will", "Trail of tears" and "Sun" the album prioritizes riffs over melody creating this extra heavy essence. The production is also very different to the standards of the previous album despite the consistency of Roy Z on the production board. Overall "Crucible" is probably one of the most ambiguous works the metal God within the metal genre that offers a fair amount of memorable songs with a sound that stands out even by today's standards.

This is the self-titled debut album by Norwegian melodic rock/AOR band "Da Vinci" originally released in 1987, re-issued in 2006 by "MTM Music". The line up features lead singer Lars Aass, guitarist Gunnar Westlie, bassist Bjorn Boge, drummer Jarle Maloy and keyboardist Dag Selboskar.Upon first play one notices the over-produced rhythm section which dominates the rhythmic of the album from the first song to the last. The second characteristic of "Da Vinci" identifiable early on is their melodic orientation. The guitars, complemented by the keyboards, provide the majority of melodies found on this debut not to mention a range of masterful solos. Equally important, as you would expect, is the contribution of singer Lars who can handle just about every vocal melody whether he sings over a keyboard into or leading the band into an intense chorus on top of all instruments.One could roughly describe "Da Vinci" as a subtler version of "Europe", baring the same thick production but at the same time relying very little on riffs, which is quite remarkable for a rock band by any standards. Clearly, melody is the name of the game for "Da Vinci" and the more one moves along the track list the bigger the melodies and the more intense the performance becomes. Standout tracks include "Forever in my heart", "lookin' for love", "Dreamin'" , "look at me now" and the power-ballad "Ain't no goodbyes"; to be fair each and every of these songs could be regarded as classic of `80s AOR baring the flamboyance of melodic hard rock coated with the subtlety of adult oriented rock. Fans of the genre as well as collectors should definitely grab "Da Vinci"s debut album provided the opportunity.

Ever since bassist- vocalist Matt Sinner became involved with Primal Fear, this world class heavy metal outfit became (seemingly) his first priority. Subsequently, albums such as "The end of sanctuary" and "There will be execution" lacked in comparison to Primal Fear and early Sinner albums. This time Sinner has returned with a first class hard rock- heavy metal album. From the opening riffs one comes to understand that this work is an outcome of true inspiration as it clearly separates Sinner from the Primal fear style.Every once in a while albums like this emerge to remind us that there are still many great licks to be discovered.

"Sixx A.M." is the sleaze metal/melodic rock band-project of Nikki Sixx ("Motley Crue") and "The heroin diaries soundtrack" is their debut album released in 2007. This studio effort was released as a musical complement to the successful autobiographical book of the same title exploring possibly the most excessive year in Nikki's life.Separating the album from the book, "...soundtrack" is an incredibly well arranged effort, possibly the most diverse sleaze metal album ever, and I have to admit I did not expect it to be quite at that level of accomplishment. The songwriting features everything from orchestral arrangements, acoustic instruments all complementary to the "Sixx A.M." rock band. The line up features James Michael on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, DJ Ashba on lead guitar and naturally Nikki on bass and backing vocals.Beyond the sleaze metal riffs and rhythm section, `...Soundtrack' has a surprisingly melodic orientation, with emphasis on instrumental harmonies, large choruses, and super catchy vocal melodies. One could only guess that the melodic side of the album is due to the contribution of James Michael being the lead singer and co-songwriter along with Nikki. Favorite tracks include "Life is beautiful", "Pray for me", "Van Nuys" and the beautiful instrumental "intermission".Overall, "The heroin diaries soundtrack" effectively pushes the boundaries of Sleaze metal and it is fitting that it is put together by the man that invented the genre in the early 80s. The musical depth of this album is such that you really do not need to have read the book to enjoy, simply if you enjoy Sleaze metal or melodic rock, this is an inescapable must.

"Dreamhunter" is the third studio album by Swedish melodic hard rock group "Treat" originally released in 1987. The line up features lead singer Robert Ernlund, guitarists Lillen Liljegren and Anders Wikstrom, bassist Ken Siewertson and drummer Jamie Borger.With "Dreamhunter", "Treat" attempted to thicken their sound into a much harder version of their established melodic rock approach. One immediately notices the up-front rhythm section which develops into a big part of "Dreamhunter". The presence of guitars has also intensified adding twin melodic lines and extensive solos beyond the obvious riffs and rhythm parts. In addition Ernlund puts on a far more complete vocal performance than what found on the previous albums, often singing and sustaining on higher notes.As a result there a good few highlights on "Dreamhunter"; the groovy-melodic "Dancing on the Edge" the drama of "Outlaw" the "Europe"-esque "World of promises" and the anthemic "One Way to glory" all first rate melodic hard rockers from an `80s band growing artistically album after album. Fans of the European melodic rock/ glam metal scene of the `80s, and Sweden in particular should definitely try "Dreamhunter" it is amongst the greatest albums to come out of the "Treat" camp.

A winter story... Christmas bonfire...Setting the scenery, in late 1992 original "Bonfire" vocalist "Claus Lessmann" quits the band perceivably due to the fact that "Bonfire" didn't manage to expand in the US. A new singer was appointed. Formerly of "JR Blackmore Group" and "Letter x", Michael Bormann took the "Bonfire" microphone and recorded the band's album number 5 only to find out that their record label what not happy with this new recruitment, subsequently dropping the band in order to concentrate on the up and coming Grunge wave. Needless to say the album was shelved...In 1998 Angel Schleifer reunites with Michael Bormann while both consider releasing the 1993 album. However the rest of 1993 line up were not interested so for legal reasons the duo released the album under the moniker of "Charade".The AlbumExciting no question to discover an obscurity like this, yet the album is far from perfect. It definitely has the trademark sound: catchy guitar riffs with additional acoustic parts above a variety of drum pattern, yet the change of voice might alienate fans. Still issue remains that the album generally falls short in terms of direction while the performance is not as forceful aggressive and confident when compared to the four classic bonfire albums. It seemed that the uncertainty of the troubled early 90s played its part in this case.That is not to say however that the album does not have quality and strong moments (much like the heavy and flamboyant track "Bad Boys"). Additionally the performance of Schleifer and Bormann in terms of technique is flawless with Angel being very inventive in his solo spots.If you are a Bonfire fan you should check this album even just to discover how the band sounded with Bormann at the helm. If you are a "Bonfire" die hard, you know by know that something is missing from your collection.Since this album is unavailable buy "Charade 2" which is a package of both Charade 1&2 (if you check specs of Charade 2 in Amazon you will see that it is actually two CDs).

This is by all means a fantastic album. If this is your first encounter with Primal Fear you will find power- heavy metal of the best quality from a band that has constantly been making superior records.For the experienced fans in the ranks of Primal Fear this is as good as every other fear release. It is definitely one step ahead in the course that commenced through "Devil's Ground" (2004) and continued with "Seven Seals" (2005). Primal Fear progress by adding orchestral instruments in parts and female guest vocals by "Epica" lead singer Simone Simons. However, by playing the album one will come to understand that above all, this is a faithful reproduction of the established high- octane, razor-sharp Primal Fear style. You might not even notice the orchestral fills when hearing this album for the first time.Even the British press had to acknowledge the superiority of this release; Specifically "Power Play" magazine (issue 92) gives this item a 10/10, commenting "put simply, this is brilliant". In other words, it does not get any better than this, a perfect record and as you might know, one doesn't expect to come across this rating very often when it comes to British journalists."Classic rock" magazine (issue 112) which does not specialise in power/heavy metal marked this album with 7/10 commenting "(Primal fear have) gone mano a mano with Helloween with their fiercely technical, exuberantly overblown epics"Finally the album reached number 60 at the German charts, number 67 on the Swedish charts and number 37 on the Japanese charts. You will not regret investing on this remarkable album.

This is the self-titled debut album by American melodic hard rock band "Line of Fire" re-issued in 2010 by "Divebomb Records". The line up features seasoned guitarist Nikki Dimage, lead singer Shawn Pelata and guitarist Ed Darst along with supporting musicians Justin Collins on Drums and Cliff Paul on bass.The sound of "Line of Fire" on this debut is built on a mixture of distorted and acoustic guitars, well crated guitar melodies/leads, robust rhythm section (where the bass often takes a leading role within song structures) and distinctly melodic lead vocals courtesy of Shawn who sounds similar to Tony Mills in both style and tone.Though appropriately labeled as melodic hard rock, one finds that the songs featured on the "Line of Fire" debut rely just as much on the melodic aspects of their structure as on rhythm patterns; for that matter "Line of fire" is especially groovy (by melodic rock standards) which makes for memorable songs.It has to be addressed that the more one moves along the track-list the more melodic "line of fire" becomes; in particular songs like "Morning Light", `Salvation's Edge", "Falling down" and "Time to say goodbye" are indeed the albums most melodic moments and perhaps the most infectious. More US bands should pick up on the example of "Line of Fire".

"Cast Away" is the second studio album by Austrian Symphonic metal band "Visions of Atlantis" originally released in 2004. "Cast Away" was the last album to feature female lead singer Nicole Bogner alongside guitarist Werner Fiedler, male singer Mario Plank, bassist Mike Koren, drummer Thomas Caser and keyboardist Miro Holly."Visions of Atlantis" were one of the first bands to experiment with mixing male and female vocals over a symphonic melodic/power metal basis. On this early release, Nicole's vocal parts obscure Mario's contribution with the majority of lines performed by the female singer. Her approach lies mainly within the classical singing method, without touching operatic style, though one feels that a more freestyle/rock approach would be more effective on certain parts.The overall sound is built on rhythm guitars, up front metallic rhythm section, leading keyboard harmonies topped by the vocal duets. Clearly the songwriting process has been kept as simple as possible a fact that granted the band considerable mainstream metal appeal internationally, however it is not quite at the level of following releases such as "Trinity" and "Delta" particularly on the subject of the verses and choruses. For fans of female fronted metal in the style of "Nightwish" and "Epica", "Visions of Atlantis" is a solid offer in the genre.

"Worldchanger" is the second solo album of Norwegian rock/metal singer Jorn Lande, originally released in 2001. A year past the release of his debut, "Starfire", Jorn returns with an all-originals studio album and stable band line-up."Worldchanger" a bold title by any standards, was a healthy second step in the singer's solo career establishing Jorn as a songwriter, apart from extraordinary vocalist while forging a musical partnership with laed guitarist Tore Moren who would become a key member of Jorn's band in the years to come; the two also form the songwriting core of the album. The line up is completed by bassist Sid Ringsby and drummer Jan Aksel.In terms of direction "Worldchanger" like its predecessor, could be characterized as pomp/melodic hard rock only this time substantially heavier with greater emphasis on guitar riffs and big drumming. And there rockers come in plenty, the attack of "Sunset station", the swagger and passion of "Christine" and the infectious AOR of "Bridges will Burn" make "Worldchanger" another landmark in Lande's career an album that indeed features songs that never sound old.Overall "Worldchanger" further solidified the reputation of Jorn Lande while also being the first attempt in turning "Jorn" from a solo project to a full time band; a definite must for any fan of pomp hard rock.

"Heaven Knows" is the 5th studio album by British songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Steve Newman, originally released in 2006. "Newman" has been active since the late `90s putting across a melodic rock/AOR sound that references directly the best part of `80s rock, growing artistically with each album. Much like the preceding albums, "Heaven Knows" is largely a personal effort from Steve's part; The songwriter plays guitar, bass and keyboards beyond vocals which clearly are his specialty; indeed a commanding voice sounding mature yet filled with attack necessary to forge memorable and convincing melodic rockers. The only full-time ally to Steve's cause is Rob McEwen who performs drums on the entire album.Having established that the musical basis of "Newman" is melodic rock/AOR it has to be addressed that "Heaven Knows" features a fair amount of hard rocking moments, namely the title track and "Move on. Clearly the protagonist instrument, aside of Steve's vocals, are the guitars. In fact the majority of melodies, harmonies and riffs come from the guitars as keyboards play a complementary role in each song's structure; one excludes the piano-driven power ballad "Learning to live", actually one of the album's strongest moments.The production quality of "Heaven Knows" is flawless handled once again by Newman himself, delivering a thick and satisfactory sound with up-front guitars and rich rhythm section. "Heaven Knows" may come out as a one-man-show yet it bares the artistic quality to match higher profile works of the genre; yet another great release by "Newman".

"Dancing on Coals" is the second studio album by funk melodic rock band "Bang Tango" originally released in 1991, reissued in 2011 by `Metal Mind Productions'. The line up features lead singer Joe Leste, guitarists Mark Knight and Kyle Stevens, bassist Kyle Kyle and drummer Tigo Ketler.Musically, "Dancing on Coals" proved a huge step forward for the band, effectively establishing a style and sound of their own. From their debut it became clear that "Bang Tango" had an attitude towards funk; on this second album the funky groove comes out more refined and in perfect alignment with the leading/melodic instruments of their sound. For that matter, the guitar parts are far more sophisticated than what found on their debut; very precise and clean on the rhythm parts and shredding during the solos. Not to mention that the vocal performance is considerably more disciplined with emphasis on the melodies and choruses.It would be fair to say that the overall style of the band (both musical concept and image) was ahead of its time, blending a rather noir atmosphere with the groove of rock'n roll and the melodies and choruses of AOR. Such style would later become trademark for contemporary European glam/goth bands much like the "69 Eyes" and others. "Dancing on Coals" was indeed a unique album in its time, standing apart from the majority of the melodic hard rock scene.

Casanova is the self titled debut album by the German melodic hard rock band originally released in 1989, reissued in 2010 by "Divebomb Records". "Casanova" was put together by singer/guitarist Michael Voss, already at the time a household name within the German melodic rock scene as the leader of "Mad Max". The line up features drummer Michael Eurich, guitarist Stephan Neumeier, bassist Jurgen Attig alongside Voss who performs guitars and lead vocals.Arguable what separates "Casanova" form the majority of melodic hard rock bands of that time, is their American-rock orientation; Michael's crystal clear mid-to-high range vocals and impeccable accent at no point hint the European identity of the quartet. Music-wise "Casanova" are a characteristically guitar driven melodic hard rock band, perhaps too heavy to be labeled AOR, yet reliant on catchy hooks, big choruses and memorable harmonies. From the first couple of songs "Don't talk about love" and "Burning Love" to the immense power ballad "Love lies" to the frenetic groovy/melodic "Bang Bang", "Casanova" seems to have everything one could expect from an `80s rock album. And the list of powerful rockers goes on "Sticky Sweet", "Back to the Wall", "Ride the wings of freedom", "Hollywood angels" are a thrilling barrage of overblown rock music.It has to be addressed that part of the release's contemporary appeal comes down to "Divebomb Records" who re-mastered the album in 2010 and it does make a great difference since the guitars sound immense and the drum sound thicker than anyone could have thought possible from an `80s record. Add to that five bonus tracks, raising the track list to 19, and you have the ultimate version of an `80s hard rock classic!

Paul Sabu was/is a well known hard rock producer, songwriter, guitarist and vocalist in the hard rock- glam metal ranks (Kiss, Alice Cooper). Heartbreak his second solo effort is a good hard rock album which brings to the surface his underrated vocal abilities (a mixture of David Coverdale and Kip winger) and guitar playing (Van Halen style). A solid album indeed, with some surprisingly emotional moments, yet typical 80's hard rock in its biggest part. Knowing Sabu's abilities it could have been perfect.(His mid- late 80s outfit was renamed from "Sabu" to "Only Child".)

Although mostly known as the lead singer for hard rock/glam metal band `Danger Danger' from the mid `90s to the mid `00s, it is arguably "Stick it in your ear" that launched the Canadian vocalist's career in the rock world. "Stick it in your ear" is the solo and recording debut of Paul Laine, originally released in 1990."Stick it..." is considered by both press and fans of the genre a classic AOR album and one of the greatest ever. Naturally the album borrows considerably from hair metal in thick guitars and stylish-at times macho-singing from Laine. For that matter the album is probably the most versatile vocal performance that Paul has expressed in his recording career. It moves from the angelic clean AOR vocals (which wood soon become the singer's trademark), to mature and rough tones (in the style of Coverdale and Winger) as well as making fair use of high pitched notes particularly during the choruses and backing vocals.The songwriting moves from pomp AOR, to glam metal, to acoustic and semi acoustic rockers in a way that challenges and promotes at the same time the amazing vocal abilities of the Canadian singer. Favorite tracks include "Dorianna", "Is it love", "We are the young" and "Heart of America".Overall "Stick it..." is a classic late 80s/ early 90s melodic rock album firmly establishing one of the greatest voices of the genre that would continue to grow artistically throughout the 90s. (The album was reissued in 1995, including the original 9 songs of the first edition plus four bonus tracks: "My hometown", "Only Your heart", "Keep on running" and "After the Rain".)

"Too hot to Sleep" is the 7th studio album by American AOR band "Survivor", originally released in 1988 and their last studio effort in the `80s. In contrast to the previous albums "Too hot to Sleep" was arguably put together on a project basis featuring founding members guitarist Frankie Sullivan, keyboardist Jim Peterik, and established vocal powerhouse Jimi Jamison. Bass is performed by Billy Syniar and drums contributed by Mickey Curry.On "Too hot..." "Survivor" adapt to a certain extent to late `80s rock standards which not only applies to their image and visual aspects but also to the production which is considerably thicker (not heavier)that the previous albums and perfectly polsihed.Beyond that, "Too hot..." is a natural continuation of the "Survivor" sound founded on "Vital Designs" and developed on "When seconds count". So once again "Delivers" keyboard-driven AOR supported by slick, though reserved, rhythm section plus fair amounts of acoustic and electric guitars. In retrospect one can not overlook that the album features a good number of quality Adult oriented rockers including the huge chorus single "Didn't know it was love". There is also the power-rocker "Can't give it up", the groovy "Rhythm of the city", the climactic "Burning Bridges" and of course the mega-melodic "Desperate dreams" built on keyboard/guitar harmonies to die for."Too hot to handle" is a commonly overlooked offering in the "Survivor" catalogue which never-the-less suceed in delivering more AOR magic by this legendary line-up.

This is the self titled debut album by melodic rock/AOR group Survivor originally released in 1979, reissued in 2010 by "Rock Candy Records". This early line up of "Survivor" features founders Jim Peterik on keyboards and Frankie Sullivan on guitars, original lead singer Dave Bickler and the ryhtm section of bassist Dennis Keth Johnson and drummer Gary Smith."Survivor" is probably the most guitar driven album in the band's catalogue, essentially bringing to front a mixture of `70s hard rock/rock'n'roll and adult oriented rock (which would better define their later works). The album opens on "Somewhere in America" which perfectly follows the approach mentioned above and the same applies to the following four tracks. "Survivor" is loaded with some serious hard/heavy rock attack on this debut, still we are treated to a glimpse of what the future of rock would hold in the `80s. That's `track 7', "The whole town's talking", an authentic AOR gem at its own right perfectly indicative of the approach "Survivor" would follow on their later releases. Equally impressive is the pomp-rocker "Whatever it takes" which closes the album.It has to be mentioned also that Bickler, is easily at the top of his game technically with a vocal range and tone that perfectly fit that king of songwriting, clearly leading the band through most of the songs on "Survivor". The "Rock Candy" reissue features a bonus track in "Rebel Girl" while the re-mastering works miracles, perfectly reviving this rock classic.

Following the launch of "Firewind" and guitar wizard Gus G to international level, a new guitar player emerged from the Greek metal ranks in 2004. Undertaking the pseudonym Overlord, the guitarist puts together a temporary band featuring "Firewind" Key player Bob Katsionis and drummer Fotis Benardo (who played with Gus G in "Nightrage") Additionally V. Axiotis is in charge of the vocals and does fine.Taking into account that Overlord consciously decided to seal his music in the inflexible barriers of neoclassical power metal (pretty much the "Malmsteen style"), one could admit that his album came out quite well. By definition there is nothing innovative here but the compositions are good enough and definitely fun listening to. Above all this album establishes the potential of Overlord at least as a technical guitar player.In addition the production of this album is good. All instruments are mixed and balanced properly delivering a warm sound, yet the guitar and drum sound lacking in depth at parts.Finally, a good album from Overlord which will not disappoint fans of "Firewind". If you have already bought all four Firewind albums and can not wait for a new Firewind release buy this, it will hopefully satisfy you for a while.

"Dreams for the daring" is the second album by German melodic hard rock band "Dreamtide" released in 2003. "Dreamtide" are mostly known as a side project for the members of the highly acclaimed "Fair Warning" while their original band was put on ice during the early-mid '00.Specifically the line up features guitar virtuoso Helge Engelke and drummer CC Behrens, joined by bassist Ole Hemplemann, key player Torsten Luederwaldt and lead singer Olaf Senkbeil. An objective, as possible, review of the band would conclude that their sound is not far at all from "Fair Warning". For that matter Helge's lead guitar playing is equally melodic and extensive as on his FW works featuring all his trademark licks and irresistible solo work. CC's drumming is also recognizable being, upfront in the mix, displaying inventive rhythm patterns and occasional double bass attack. Even Ole's bass playing is practically identical to that of "FW" bassist Ule Ritgen. So one could claim that "Dreamtide" carries the essence of "Fair Waring" with Olaf's vocals being the main point of differentiation, giving the band its distinct sound. Subsequently "Dreams for the daring" is consistent to the musical quality of its predecessor and simply offers more great songs in the vein of their debut: "Dream Real", "I'll be moving on", "Man on a mission", "Out there", and "You can't burn my heart out".So in many ways what you get with "Dreamtide" is a different take on the established melodic rock of "Fair Warning" as the performance and songwriting do not deviate from the paradigm of the latter mentioned band. For fans of "Fair Warning", "Zeno" and German melodic hard rock in general, this is a safe, as it gets, purchase.

"Bad Boy Live" is the second live album by John Sykes and `Blue Murder', originally released in 2004, standing also as his latest release to date. Much like the previous live album, `Screaming Blue Murder', "Bad Boy Live" captures guitar virtuoso John Sykes and his group during their Japanese tour of 2004.The line up features Sykes on guitar and vocals, long serving band-mate bassist extraordinaire Marco Mendoza, drum icon Tommy Aldridge and key-player Derek Sherinian. The set list is a mixture of Sykes' solo material and classics from the 1987 `Whitesnake' album as well as a couple of tunes from his Thin Lizzy/Lynott days. It has to be clear that the production, mixing and mastering of the album is amongst the greatest to be featured on a live album. The emphasis is clearly on John's guitar and vocals while drums, keyboards and bass are also captured in detail. You will easily be able to follow Mendoza's distinct playing throughout the set-list.It has to be addressed that the band performs all songs to the letter, totally respectful of the original studio versions while adding a great deal of their own in the performances. One happily finds that John is more than comfortable singing "Whitesnake" and "Thin Lizzy" songs, his vocals are convincing and precise on each and every song on "Bad Boy Live"-the only minor exception being the vocal intro of `Crying in the rain'. On the other hand `Bad Boys', `Thunder and lightning' `Cold Sweat' `We all fall down', are songs where Sykes and co fire on all cylinders, making for master-class performances. Equally impressive is the fact that two of the most intriguing compositions of the set `Baby Please don't Leave me" and "Still of the Night" lose nothing of their original atmosphere as the band delivers with unmistakable feeling.Conclusively `Bad Boy Live' is an incredible live set, if a bit short, bringing together songs from some of the most renowned hard rock bands supported by masterful performances and genuine live feeling.

Reissued by Rock Candy records is the debut album by melodic rock/AOR sensation "Melidian" originally released in 1989. Though perhaps one of the lesser known melodic rock bands of the time, "Melidian" put forward a solid proposition in adult oriented rock through the release of "Lost in the Wild".What separates "Melidian" from the majority of melodic rock bands is that they manage to sound atmospheric and cohesive/aggressive at the same time. This double identity is very much due to their ability to balance guitars and keyboards and vocals. For that matter, lost in the wild is equally a guitar-keyboard driven album where the keys and rhythm section lay the basis of each structure while the guitars and vocals carry the majority of melodies.One happily finds that the songwriting holds its own even by the standards of the contemporary melodic rock scene which combined with the amazing performances and effective re-mastering make "Lost in the wild" amongst the best releases to come out of "Rock Candy Records". Honestly one can not fail to appreciate the melodic essence and overall artistic quality of such songs as "Ready to Rock", "Livin' under the gun", "Fire up the heart", "Overheated" and "Top of the Rock". If you are a fan of melodic rock/AOR you can not go wrong with "Melidian".

Guitarist Jurgen R. Blackmore is the half German son of Iconic rock guitarist Richie Blackmore (Deep Purple, Rainbow). "Still Holding On" is his debut album recorded during 1990 subsequently released in 1993. This album is also the recording debut of renowned German AOR/H.Rock vocalist Michael Bormann (ex "Jaded Heart", Rain, "Redrum", Solo). The lineup is completed by bass player Mike Matthes, drummer Wolfgang Beisel and key player Malte Rathke.This album is nothing less than a true underground Hard Rock milestone. Jurgen demonstrates significant abilities in terms of performance and compositions that go far beyond typical hard rock while Michael Bormann lays down what could be considered his best ever vocal performance. This album features ultra heavy (for 90s era) guitar riffs followed by choruses with shocking backing vocals. These elements are constant throughout the album which features extra fast HR tracks such as "Wild and Free", "Running Alone", "Day By Day" and "Miracle" as well as melodic diamonds in "Nothing Burns Forever", "Don't Walk Away", "Show me the way to go", "Never too Late".To be perfectly honest, I bought this album under the perception of it being just another Bormann project. After playing this to say I was surprised would be an understatement.If you consider buying a classic album this month pick this one and you will be hit by a barrage of devastating hard rock. This album is qualified to shoot the listener's adrenaline through the roof!|No AOR, No Glam Metal, just fast- aggressive- ultra hard- ROCK|

"Sahara" is the second studio album by American melodic hard rock super-group "House of Lords" originally released in 1990. This second full-length effort found the "Lords" under a slightly different line-up than the original, featuring lead singer James Christian, keyboardist Craig Giuffria, bassist Chuck Wright, drummer Ken Mary along with new entry guitarist Michael Guy. The album also features guitar contributions by such heroes of the genre as Chris Impellitteri, Doug Aldrich and Rick Nielsen.While fitting perfectly within the pomp hard rock genre, "Sahara" was substantially differentiated from its predecessor in terms of musical style. The song-writing would rely much more on riffs and tempos rather than melodies; at the same time integrating eastern-scale harmonies to the structures. The eastern-vibe is mainly traceable on Greg's keyboard arrangements, being an element that would partly characterize the group's later releases.James Christian once again proves himself the ideal singer/front-man for the group, perfectly adapting to the demands of the compositions though the end result is far less catchy than the material found on their debut album. In addition this effort features a surprising consistency in tempos, for the biggest part being either standard or slow pace; clearly a far cry from the rhythmic variety found on later "Lords" releases. While far from the greatest moment in the "House of Lords" catalogue, "Sahara" offers a fair amount of memorable songs namely "Can't find my way home", "It ain't love" plus the classic/minor hit ballad "Remember my name" possibly the album's strongest moment.

Before Sinner formed his own band he was, as a teenager, involved in a band called "Shiva" with Schmidt and Sabol. After over 20 years the power trio entered the studio (2006) to record/ resurrects their material. The end result is a fairly good hard rock album with some blues influences here and there. It is very likely that once you play this album a number of monster hard rock bands will storm your mind. Indeed Goddess Shiva is an amalgam of Van Halen, Whitesnake and Motorhead.Although external influence is painfully obvious this release stands by no means as a cheap rip off.Definitely enjoyable.

Amongst enthusiast of 80s hard rock, "Mad Max" is commonly recognized as the original German white metal band, having made their debut in 1982. "White sands" is the band's 7th studio album originally released in 2007.The line up features singer, guitarist Michael Voss (who is lately known as the creative force behind the "Voices of rock" all star projects), drummer Axel Kruse ("Jaded heart"), guitarist Jurgen Breforth and bassist Roland Bergmann. As with anything involving Voss, "white sands" benefits from top production and intense performances.Musically the style of "Mad Max" could be described as a blend of "Stryper" with "Bonfire"; so one could claim that "White Sands" is actually a mixture of the American and German melodic hard rock. Long term fans would also be glad to know that the band has not lost the glamorous 80s attitude; despite being essentially Christian metal, that does not prevent "Mad max" from having fun with their music, so do not be surprised if you come across some melodies and choruses that sound a lot like "Kiss". Overall "White sands" is a top quality melodic hard rock/white metal album yet songs like "We fight it in white", "Change it" and "Too wrong" come out so powerful that admittedly overshadow the rest of the material. Beyond that, "White Sands" is another serious proposition for any melodic fan coming from the pioneers of German White metal.

"Carnival of lies" is the third album by melodic metal group "Obsession" originally released in 2007, marking their reformation. "Obsession" was the metal outfit of Michael Vescera in the mid-late `80s before the singer would move on to highly acclaimed collaborations with such talents as Yngwie Malmsteen and Joe Stump.The reformed "Obsession" features bassist Chris McCarvill (also of "House of Lords"), guitarists Scott Boland and John Bruno along with drummer Jay Mezias. "Carnival of lies" is a quality melodic metal album with a clear `80s orientation featuring catchy harmonies and choruses that should appeal to most fans of the genre. One also has to address that guest appearances are a big part of this comeback album. We are looking at two guitar virtuosos who perform on five songs, these are Rob Marcello ("Danger Danger") and Joe Stump (who co-founded "Reign of Terror" with Michael).The production handled by Vescera grants the album a thick and satisfactory sound without undermining the melodic aspects of "Carnival of lies" with such standouts as "In for the kill", "Playing dead", "I don't belong", the opener "Smoking gun" as well as the title track. If you enjoy heavy yet melodic metal with a clear `80s orientation combining solid songwriting and flamboyant performances, "Obsession-Carnival of lies" is a great proposition.

"Living in the Fear of the Private Eye" is the second album by British AOR/melodic rock group "Export" originally released in 1986, reissued by "Rock Candy" records in 2010. Much like other melodic outfits hailing form the United Kingdom - namely "Heavy Pettin", "Lionheart" and "Romeo's Daughter"-"Export" were signed and addressed to the North American market, essentially complying with the musical standards set by such bands as "Survivor", "Toto" and "Styx" .It is quite a challenge to describe the way "Export" approach AOR; just consider that they combing hard rocking rhythm guitars with subtle electric or acoustic guitar melodies over a rhythm section that moves from standard rock tempos, to jazzy grooves to arena-rock beats. Keyboard harmonies are also a big part of "Export"s sound though often obscured by the ever-present guitars.So a fair label for "Export" would be `Pomp AOR' since they do combine catchy melodic rock with clever instrumentations, all coated by colorful arrangements. Indeed "No Escape", "Runnign Back", "Airwaves", "Tear me apart", "Can't say no" as well as the title track are the cream of encephalic melodic music.Clearly we are looking at a very talented team of musicians including the accomplished singer Harry Shaw, guitarist Steve Morris, bassist Chris Alderman, drummer Lou Rosenthal and keyboardist George Wallace. Overall "Living..." is the experienced AOR fan's album - it does force one to revise their perspective of the genre.

This is the self-titled debut album by German melodic hard rock band "Pink Cream 69", originally released in 1989. Although "Pink Cream 69" would turn considerably heavier in their later releases, their debut was aligned to the standards of a high quality late `80s rocker.The line up features lead singer Andi Deris (who would later front leading power metal band "Helloween"), guitarist Alfred Koffler, drummer Kostas Zafiriou and bassist Denis Ward, currently amongst the top songwriters and producers in melodic rock/AOR. This self titled debut, uncovers a great deal of their musical talent that is so evident in the member's latest works/projects. The protagonist element on the album, I have to insist, is the songwriting; "Pink Cream 69" draws on both European and American melodic rock bringing to front songs that stand differentiated from one another. "Take those tears" is the dramatic heartbreaker rocker, "Sugar for love" is the playful glam-tune, "One step into paradise" is the direct hard rocker with a forceful chorus and "I only wanna be with you" is the keyboard-accompanied potential radio hit.In terms of performance the leading instruments are naturally Andy's vocals and Alfred's inventive guitar playing; Kostas on the other hand, is not as up-front in the mix and does not quite deliver the drum attack he would later be renowned for. Overall "Pink Cream 69" should be regarded as a classic `80s melodic hard rock album, introducing musical personas that would remain relevant forces of the scene in the following decades.

The history of fear is the first live-DVD of German power/melodic metal band "Primal Fear" originally released in 2003. Having established themselves as a leading band in power metal since 1998 it was very much expected that a live DVD would follow."The history of fear" captures two live sets of "Primal Fear"; The first is a club show in support of their latest-at the time- studio album "Black sun"(2002) while the second is a festival appearance at "Wacken open air 2001" at the time promoting their "Nuclear Fire"(2000) album (the Wacken show is also included on audio CD in this package). Both sets capture the band at incredible artistic heights with set list emphasis on the two albums they were promoting at the time. Experienced fans rightfully expect high pitched vocal attack, metallic riffs, double bass impact, twin guitar melodies and extensive solos sealing a heavy, melodic and catchy-as metal gets- show.The line up is consistent on both shows featuring iconic singer Ralf Scheepers, bassist Mat Sinner, guitarists Stefan Leibing and Henny Wolter and drummer Klaus Sperling. The sound quality is of top quality particularly on the indoor venue, offering both stereo and 5.1 surround options. One also has to clarify that the set-list of the shows is substantially differentiated with only one song "Chainbreaker" being performed on both concerts. On a personal level I expected the band to shine throughout the heavier and faster songs which they did; yet the real surprise comes at the indoor show where "Primal Fear" perform two of their greatest power-ballads "Tears of rage" and "Under your spell" uncovering all their talent and charisma as songwriters and stage performers.For any fan of melodic metal, this is amongst the greatest live DVDs you can buy, being still great value 8 years past its release. For the ultimate experience in power metal one suggests "The history of fear" along with their latest live-DVD "16.6-All over the world" (2010).

This self-titled "Hardcore Superstar" album is the Swedish sleaze band's fifth studio album, originally released in 2005. "Hardcore Superstar" marked a considerable turn in the band's artistic direction, leaving behind sleaze rock and taking on sleaze metal."Hardcore Superstar" brought to front a considerably thicker sound where the rock rythm section was replaced by double bass drumming and robust bass while the guitar parts became heavier and more precise. As before, catchy choruses remain the ace in "Hardcore Superstar" s deck with "Kick on the Upperclass", "Bag on your head", "We don't celebrate Sundays" and "Wild Boys" all filled with instant appeal that "Superstar" songs are known for. The production is also more `metallic' so to speak with emphasis on the rythm parts yet ever undermining the melodic lines of each song. Once again the group justified the argument there being no such thing as a boring or uninteresting "Hardcore Superstar" song or album.As before you will find singer Joakim Berg leading the band featuring bassist Martin Snadvik, guitarist Thomas Silver and drummer Magnus Andreasson through the twelve songs of this self-titled album. Overall "Hardcore Superstar" was the first step in a musical direction that the quartet follows to this day, effectively laying the foreground for such follow-ups as "Dreaming in a casket" and "Beg for it".

"Blvd" is the debut album by Canadian AOR band "Boulevard" originally released in 1988; this particular edition is a 2010 reissue by "Metal Mind Productions". The line up features lead singer David Forbes, guitarist Randy Gould, keyboardist Andrew Johns, bassist Randy Burges and drummer Jerry Adolphe."Blvd" comes very close to the definition of `80s American AOR bringing to front a musical style that relies on keyboard melodies and driving bass, complemented by tick drumming and guitar harmonies. So the "Boulevard" debut is definitely not the guitar driven `80s rock album, though it does sound intense and despite the lack of guitar-drive it manages to engage the listener with its performance attack.For that matter, the bass proves an indispensable part of the "Blvd" sound carrying the tempo, groove while also harmonizing with the vocals and the rest of the band. Equally significant is the contribution of Forbes, with such a clean and melodic tone, the singer is indeed the heart of "Boulevard". "Blvd" features such melodic highlights as "Dream On", "Far from Over", "In the twilight" and "Missing Persons". No question, "Blvd" belongs to the extra radio-friendly sound of `80s rock which is not to say however that this debut is found lacking in terms of songwriting or technique. Old-school "AOR" purists will definitely make the most of the "Boulevard" debut.

"Main attraction" is a melodic rock/hard rock project featuring ex- "On the rise" singer Bennech Lyngboe; "Keep on coming back" was originally release in 2006."On the rise" has built a reputation of guitar-intense melodic rock offering loads of infectious tracks; On that count "Main Attraction" is not very different from the previously mentioned band; Apart from Bennech who is expectedly the focal point of the band, attention is drawn upon guitarist Ronny Heimdal who throws in hard rock riffage, AORish melodic lines and shredding solos. The rhythm section of bassist Jan Kleveland and drummer Zsolt Meszros is accurate but rather typical; suggesting that some of the heavier moments of the album could benefit from some double bass drums and improvisations. Still as this is mainly melodic rock, one can not really expect flamboyant performances on all instruments and that's perfectly fine."Main Attraction" falls nowhere short in comparison to "On the rise", as mentioned above it is made up of the very same qualities. There are no weak moments on the album, but standout tracks are probably "Calm before the storm", "Remember", "Under my skin" and the heavy hitter "Over the top". Really, this is relevant material from a singer who has already established his potential and "Main attraction" reinforces the statement. A top choice for melodic rock/Hard rock fans, also a must for fans of "On the rise".

"Wild on the run" is the debut album by British melodic hard rock band "Tobruk" originally released in 1985, reissued by "Majestic Rock" in 2007. The line up features lead singer Stuart Neale, guitarists Nigel Evans and Mick Newman, keyboardist Jem Davies, drummer Alan Vallance and bassist Steve Woodward."Tobruk" played a powerful mixture of guitar/keyboard driven rock which came pretty close to the sound of "Shy" and "Bonfire". You can expect thick drumming, AOR-like bass lines, intense guitar riffs, twin guitar melodies and shredding solos along with "Bon Jovi"-like keyboards.The songwriting on "Wild on the run" is also very strong being straight to the point melodic hard rock that will never have you wait too long for a solid, sing-along chorus. Still "Wild on the run" is not an overly bright concept, as the album bares an underline of pessimism on quite a few of its tracks. Standout tracks include the opening title track, the dramatic "Falling", the dangerous "Running from the night" and the bombastic "Going down for the third time"."Wild on the run" turned out to be "Tobruk"s only album and yet one that holds its own decades past its release. Enthusiast of European melodic hard rock as well as fans of early `80s "Bon Jovi" should make the most of "Wild on the run".

Following the release of their second album `Burning Earth' (2004), the band was offered a mini summer tour of Japan supporting Rob Rock. Touring implied line up changes as original singer Stephen Frederick was unable to follow the band on the road and was subsequently replaced by Chity Somapala; in Addition live performance demanded the inclusion of keyboards/rhythm guitar-enter Bob Katsionis.The two new members joined the `Firewind' core of bass player Petros Christo, drummer Stian Kristoffersen and founder guitarist Gus G. It was this line up that entered the studio to record the third `Firewind' album `Forged by fire' which also marked a shift to major record label `Century media'. Released in early 2005 the album was in line with the sound of the previous two albums, perhaps lacking a bit in comparison: Chity's vocals are not as clear as one would expect, the keyboards for the biggest part played a complementary role and the quality of the compositions tends to vary from top power/melodic tracks to less inventive songs.As the previous albums, `Forged by fire' did deliver a good amount of `Firewind' standouts including `Kill to live', the catchy/dramatic `Hate world hero' and `The forgotten memory' plus the speedy-melodic `Escape from Tomorrow'.In retrospect it would be fair to say that although a quality release, the preceding and following albums that `Firewind' released stood higher that `Forged by Fire'. Yet it was this album that held the band's first domestic hit song, non other than `Tyranny' which firmly elevated the band from the underground (the song would also become a minor hit in other European countries). Overall 'Forged by fire' is a vital piece of modern metal history for any fan of the genre."Metal Hammer" Greek Magazine (issue 241) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: "If you are longing for well performed heavy metal, Forged by fire will satisfy almost every expectation of yours"

"Cruisin' for a bruisin'" is the third album by Danish melodic hard rock/AOR band "Fate" originally released in 1988; this particular version is a 2007 re-issue by "MTM" music. The line up features lead singer Jeff Limbo, guitarist Mr. Moth, drummer Bob Lance, bassist Pete Steiner and keyboardist Flemming Rothaus.It is true that "Cruisin' for a bruisin'" includes just about everything the experienced `80w rock fan would expect to hear; thick guitar riffs, harmonious keyboards, flamboyant rhythm section and crystal clear vocal harmonies that make for intense choruses. Still "Cruisin' for a bruisin'" has its fair share of surprises as "Fate" manage to substantially differentiate their offering from most melodic hard rock bands of the time. Take for instance the opening song "Beneath the coconuts" a ridiculously funny, but overly infectious, melodic rocker baring a chorus that peaks in melody and silliness. "Knock on the rox" and "Knock on wood" are predictable yet essential rockers for an `80s rock release, perfectly meeting their mark. Following is the extra melodic guitar/keyboard driven "Lover" with a sweet-sugary chorus to die for, also featuring a superbly melodic guitar solo.There is also the Roth/Van Halen-like "Dead boy, cold meat", built on unconventional grooves and rock'n'roll attitude; and yet the mood changes again with the mid-tempo "Babe, you got a friend" a lesson in musical harmony with guitar riffs, bass lines and keyboard melodies blending ideally.No question, if you are a fan of AOR, melodic hard rock or `80s rock in general you just have to add "Cruisin' and Bruisin'" to your collection; it is a very diverse yet cohesive and convincing rock offering, uncovering nearly all approaches to `80s rock.

"Ready to strike" is the debut album by American glam metal band "King Kobra", originally released in 1985. The band was put together by drum legend Carmine Appice ("Vanilla Fudge", Ozzy), featuring an all star-by today's standards-line up; guitarists David Michael Philips ("Big Cock", "Tunnel") and Mick Sweda ("Bullet Boys"), bassist Johnny Rod ("W.A.S.P.") and phenomenal vocalist Mark Free ("Signal", "Unruly Child")."King Kobra" were amongst the first bands to fully embrace the glam metal image and visual outrageousness that would become a must for rock bands during the second half of the `80s. Musically however, "King Kobra" stood far apart from the stereotypical glam/sleaze metal band, establishing their brand of extravagant melodic hard rock. From the opening twin guitar intro of "Ready to Strike" you know you are in for a treat; powerful riffs, over the top melodic guitars, immense rhythm section, majestic keyboard harmonies and the most convincing vocal performance by Free. Following the immense chorus and attack of the title track is the passionate hunger, the arena anthem "Shake up", the climactic "Breaking out" plus the drama fuelled "Tough guys" and "Second Thoughts".Realistically, if you are looking for `80s rock with large choruses, intense vocals, technical instrumentations and spot-on song writing then "Ready to strike" is indeed the album to buy. I suppose it is true that `80s rock does not get any better than this.

"Infinity" was the project/collaboration between renowned AOR vocalist Mitch Malloy and "Rainbow" keyboardist David Rosenthal recorded during the period 1987-1988, never before released. "Infinity" is very likely Malloy's first studio work and though unmistakably AOR/melodic rock, is substantially heavier than his later/solo works.Being a joint effort by Mitch and David, you can expect a rather keyboard driven brand of melodic rock; having said that, it has to be clear that "Infinity" features ever-present guitar riffs and a good amount of solos all fronting the mix courtesy of Reb Beach. For tapes that have been shelved over the past twenty years, "Infinity" sounds crystal clear-perhaps the drums might sound a bit thin at parts but most importantly there are no background noises or any king of interference caught on tape.One would go as far as claiming that "Infinity" is possibly one of the greatest, if not the greatest, performance of Malloy adding the spark that makes songs like "Secrets", "Christine" and "Liar" memorable. Clearly the singer is the protagonist of this project and uncovers a great deal of his vocal capabilities, once again providing evidence of why is he considered one of the greatest AOR singers. Overall "Infinity" is an honest effort that is expected to satisfy-even surprise-MM fans as well as enthusiast of the genre.

Possibly one of the most successful project albums to be issued under Frontiers Records is the "Place Vendome" debut of 2005. "Place Vendome" is iconic singer Michael Kiske (ex-"Helloween") backed by the members of the German melodic hard rock group "Pink Cream 69" ; in particular the line up features guitarist Uwe Reitenauer, keyboardist Gunter Werno, drummer Kosta Zafiriou and renowned bassist Dennis Ward who also produces this album.In retrospect, a great advantage the debut had over its successor "Streets of Fire" was Ward's involvement in the songwriting process. Dennis has composed the "Place Vendome" album in its entirety with sporadic contribution from the rest of the band. So "Place Vendome" is bound to sound a very cohesive record by any standards. To crush any speculation of the songs being actually "PC69" leftovers, one has to put firmly across that "Place Vendome" does not quite incorporate the melodic hard rock style of the previous mentioned band. "Place Vendome" is essentially AOR that merely touches upon hard rock.In terms of performance, the band goes through this selection of songs with admirable intensity obviously focusing on the melodic aspects of each composition while Michael proves himself every bit the melodic rock singer, subtle yet forceful at the same time. Add to the above there being no filler song on "Place Vendome" and you have a melodic rock high light by an all-star line up and a phenomenal singer.

"Wrecking everything live" was my introduction to the music and style of US thrash/heavy metal act "Overkill". Having purchased the album upon its release in 2002; the front cover magnetized me and somehow expected a heavy metal holocaust from this live album. And that is exactly what "Wrecking..." delivered.I guess it would be most appropriate to characterize "Overkill" as Trash metal, yet the material on this live CD, goes beyond this subgenre, holding its own as pure heavy metal magic. How could one forget the incredible bass passages, the twin guitar riff-attack, the thick melodies and of course the vocal attack and swagger of their frontman? The line up features founders vocalist Bobby Blitz Ellsworth, bassist DD Verni, guitarists Dave Linsk and Derek Tyler and drummer Tim Malaire.Upon any number of plays, one would realize that above all `Overkill' have established their own style in metal and that is precisely what is captured on "Wrecking...". The band masterfully balances rhythm attack with melody, bitterness with swagger and aggression with style. Yes for a Trash metal band, one could be surprised as of how catchy and stylish "Overkill" sound, an attribute very much due to their great front-man; beyond his technical ability, Ellsworth excels in delivering commanding vocal performances, having set the mood of each song by introducing it to the audience.I can not escape but suggest this album to any fan of heavy metal not only Thrash metal; "Wrecking everything" holds such substance in both performance and composition that should appeal to anyone looking for Heavy-as it gets-Metal.

"Midnight sun" is a technical/neoclassical hard rock band from Sweden best known amongst enthusiast as the group through which guitarist/songwriter extraordinaire Magnus Karlsson (`Primal Fear', `Allen Lande')made his professional debut while also having in their ranks, at some point, Jakob Samuel (`The Poodles') and Jamie Salazar (`Bad Habit').Still this early line up of their debut album `Above and beyond' (1998) finds band leader and bass player Jonas Reingold joining forces with guitarist Chris Palm and drummer Hempo Hilden and singer Pete Sandberg. Objectively one can make out that `Above and beyond' is an album produced in the 90s as it does not have an outstanding production; still the material more than makes up for that. Foremost the musicians are true virtuosos making extensive use of their technique without causing the album to sound complicated; instead they use progressions and neoclassical elements to make their compositions even more infectious and catchy.On a personal level, I managed to get a copy of the album in early 2009 and it definitely became one of the albums I played the most that year. A conclusive view on the album would indicate that `Above and beyond' is melodic, emotional and personal- still in terms of technique, there is a lot to be heard beyond the first play; in particular the rather inventive bass lines hidden under the lead guitars as well as the complex blend between bass and drums. Favorite tracks include `Reality', `Keep on pushing', `Deception of evil' and `Don't get me wrong'.Overall `Above and beyond' is an incredibly memorable album that manages to engage the listener directly while challenging one to come back for more detailed/analytical listening.

"Saturn Skyline" is the fourth album by Swedish-German AOR band "Last Autumn's dream" released in 2007 featuring the estabilshed line up of lead singer Mikael Erlandsson, guitarist Andy Malecek, bassist Marcel Jacob and drummer Jamie Borger.The album picks up exactly where the previous "Winter in Paradise" left off, therefore you can expect a heavier production than their first two albums, considerably guitar oriented AOR, while the keyboards have been pushed even further in the background; it has to be adressed however that instead of the typical AOR melodies, Erlandsson goes furhter with his keyboards this time laying full orchestral arrnagements. The guitars on the other hand have been further intensified contributing beyond the opening melodic lines, grooy riffs therefore leaning more towards rock'n roll than AOR. The drumming is perhaps a notch lower in the mix compared to the preceding album, which is not bad at all considering that the rhythm still sounds rocking and Jacob's bass is now perfectly audible."Saturn Skyline" being their fourth studio album captures "LAD" once more at their peak and to be fair they rarely brough to front less than their best self throughout their eight studio albums. Favorite tracks include "The young and the wild", "Pages", "Critical" and "Domino".It would be critical to note that on the liner notes while the other members thank individuals, Marcel Jacob chooses to simply thank "himself!" I do believe it is an early indicator of the tragic turn that things would take two years and two albums later, in the summer of 2009. (Adressed on the reviews of the following albums "Hunting Shadows" (2008) and "Dreamcatcher" (2009)).

"Astralism" is the third album by Swedish heavy metal band "Astral Doors" originally released in 2006. Those familiar with the works of the group would probably agree that "Astral Doors" play classic heavy metal often referencing acts like "Dio" and 70s "Scorpions" while placing equal emphasis on song-writing and performance. The line up features vocal titan Nils Patrik Johansson, guitarists Martin Haglund and Joachim Nordlund, bassist Mika Itaranta, key player Joakim Roberg and drummer Johan Lindstedt.In terms of song-writing it seems that the band put the best of their ability in composing classic sounding riffs, infectious melodies and above all, unforgettable choruses. Parts of the compositions trace in the 80s while others in the 70s, all supported by robust production, making "Astralism" an intimidating heavy metal experience.In terms of performance, "Astral doors" separate themselves form the majority of metal bands by adding as many improvisations, instrumental fills and melodies as possible. Essentially imagine a band that delivers the intensity of a live performance in their albums while being technically flawless as studio standards demand. "Astralism" is absolutely verifies the thesis above and songs like "Black Rain", "Raiders of the Ark", "In rock we trust" and "London caves" are guaranteed to captivate the listener upon first play (or more accurately upon first chorus).

"Rock'n Roll Revolution" is the first live DVD release by Norwegian glam metal band "Wig Wam" in 2005. The package is a 2DVD set, one disc featuring the band's 2005 tour documentary and promo videos while the second disc is an amazing 16-track show of the band in their home-country.The live DVD for that matter is an arena show, featuring "Wig Wam" live with the support of a full orchestra delivering what they credit as "Wig Wam Symphonic" and it is indeed an outstanding show, exemplary captured in both sight and sound on both stereo and 5.1. surround sound. And to think that this incredible production was merely in support of their debut album "Hard to be a rock'n roller", one has to congratulate the band for going the distance to deliver the biggest possible rock production.In terms of performance you can expect "Wig Wam" matching the accomplishment of the studio versions. In particular Age Sten Nilsen vocally hits any note with admirable precision, being high pitched, mid or bass range while delivering endless stage theatrics throughout the show. Guitarist Trond Holter holds nothing of his melodic shredding back, reaching the very definition of melodic hard rock guitarist while the rhythm section of bassist Bernt Jansen and drummer Oystein Andersen is just as precise and flamboyant as ever. Needless to say the songs are ideal slices of melodic hard rock/glam metal (as one would expect having experienced their debut album) that work perfectly with the support of the orchestra.Overall "Wig Wam-Rock'n'roll" revolution is considered a must for any fan of glam metal, melodic hard rock or arena rock. "Wig Wam" indeed released the ultimate DVD for a newcomer act that ultimately proves their commitment in hard rock.

`Let the demon rock'n roll' is the second album by Italian melodic hard rock band `Edge of Forever', originally released in 2005. Having discovered the band through their latest album which left a strong impression, I was very keen to getting this earlier album. And it is another great release from `Edge of Forever'. The line up once again features leader and hard rock visionary Alessandro del Vecchio on keyboards, guitarist Matteo Carnio, bass player Christian Grillo and lead singer Bob Harris, the inevitable focal point of the band with a vocal ability to match that of Glenn Hughes (during his AOR days).For those new to `Edge of forever' you can expect large melodic keyboards, plenty of guitar shredding yet most importantly, Vecchio knows how to write a great chorus while Harris is capable of adding all the drama and expressiveness without sacrificing technique.In comparison to their latest album `Another paradise', this second album proves equally as good-or perhaps-slightly better as both albums demonstrate songwriting of similar level yet the lyrics and the performances on `Let the demon...' are somewhat more memorable than their latest album. For example it does not take more than one play for the listener to recall the chorus of the final track `Edge of forever', the same goes for `One last surrender'; `Shades of November' holds tons melody while the opening track `The machine' will probably have you singing along its chorus.One has to admit the cover artwork could have been more inspiring-still the material inside is proven consistent, intense and memorable. Overall a great choice for fans of melodic hard rock.

"Hot tonight" is the debut album by British melodic hard rock/AOR band "Lionheart" originally released in 1984, reissued by "Krescendo Records" in 2008. The band was put together by guitarist Dennis Stratton featuring lead singer Chad Brown, guitarist Steve Mann who also handles keyboards, bassist Rocky Newton and drummer Bob Jenkins.Despite its origin, the "Lionheart" debut is built on the songwriting and production standards of American melodic hard rock, very much due to the fact that "Lionheart" established a US contract for "Hot Tonight". You can expect very melodic, not to mention clean, vocals, a plethora of guitar leads, ever-present keyboard harmonies and immense drumming. Most songs on "Hot Tonight" open on staccato keyboards followed by thick rhythm guitars at which point the melodic guitar lines kick in and the vocals take the lead.The production of "Hot Tonight" was clearly ahead of its time, at parts handling keyboards, vocals and twin guitar melodies without sounding overloaded at any point. On the other hand, some may criticize the over produced rhythm section (personally I consider it a huge part of the album's appeal). One can not see how any fan of melodic hard rock could go wrong with such songs as the pompous opener "Wait for the night", "Hot tonight", "Die for love", "Towers of silver" and "Nightmare" and the "Survivor"-esque "Another Crazy Dream". "Hot tonight" is as well written, executed and produced as you could possibly demand form an `80s AOR band.
