Peter Kingsley is a man who believes he knows what is Real. In Reality, he is passing his knowledge through the mouths of two famous pre-Socratics that lived in Southern Italy ~700 BC. Parmenides and his follower Empedocles were Pythagoreans and, according to Kingsley, iatromanteis - healer-prophets and sorcerers who combined techniques of shamanic ecstasy with what eventually became, through Plato, the disciplines of philosophy, rhetoric and logic.Kingsley dissects a famous Parmenides poem, pointing out evidence ostensibly suggesting that the poem - thought by most scholars to represent a foundation of what was to become `logic' - is in fact an account of a mystical journey and a blueprint aimed at guiding the `mystes' on his/her own descent into a shamanic Underworld. Kingsley stands on increasingly firm ground with respect to his hypothesis that Greek philosophy originates in shamanic practices. Greeks encountered shamanism from Central Asia through their contacts with Scythians and Thracians as well as through Persian 'Magi'. Plato himself talks in Phaedo how "first prophecies were the words of an oak" and that "everyone who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth". Pythagorean descent into the underworld was apparently practiced through `incubation', a form of shamanic `dreaming' first practiced by the Sumerians (the Sultantepe fragments), Babylonians (the stela of Nabonidus) and Egyptians, later to be inherited by Gnostics and Hermetics.Kingsley seems to be comfortable with ancient Greek texts and provides a number of novel (idiosyncratic?) translations of key terms such as logos, mythos, elenchos and metis (awareness) which seem to have had different meanings for the pre-Socratics than they did for classical Greeks. He also provides a number of intriguing readings of fragments from the Illiad to support his translations.Kingsley's approach also has a number of disconcerting elements mainly to do with classical scholarship as we understand it. While he lets us know, in literally dozens and possibly hundreds of places, that he, PK, is first person to ever correctly interpret these pre-Socratic texts whereas other scholars had it all wrong, direct references to these `others' are unfortunately very skimpy. Attribution is not PKs forte. Many important contributors are never mentioned. Heidegger, who had a similar approach and in fact seems to have had many of the same general ideas is not even mentioned in the text. More worrisome is PKs need to adapt pre-Socratic ideas to fit his own theory rather than what we know from the ancients themselves. If Kingsley's interpretation disagrees with Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Plutarch (who one would imagine knew Parmenides and Empedocles rather well), Kingsley simply tells us the information these ancient guys provide about P and E is wrong - because of their jealousy (Plato), ignorance (Plutarch) or their self-promoting philosophical agendas (Aristotle, Plato and Plotinus).There are many extremely interesting pieces of information here about the ancient Greece. I personally liked the chapters on Phocaea and those describing links between pre-Socratic texts and Sufi orders of the 9th century. The Sufis apparently held their own `Empedocles circles' and used Empedocles' ideas as a foundation for their alchemy and `magic'. The speculation about the role of the shamanic underworld in Pythagorean practices is in itself a supremely interesting and juicy subject matter. One has to give credit to Kingsley for his boldness and idiosyncrasy, as well as for his decision to eschew a classical scholarly approach for a more poetic, and evocative one. One has an impression that his main motivation for writing the book was less a desire for promoting scholarly dialogue than teaching the reader about the foundations of what constitutes our reality and techniques one might use to liberate oneself from the bondage of the preconceptions and expectations foisted on us by our fellow man. I liked that.Finally, one has to acknowledge the tricksterish quality of "Reality". The book meanders the reader through a maze of ideas, metaphors, allusions and alliterations designed to evoke an altered state, a poesis where things are seen as what they are as well as what they feel like. And those feelings are like a veil drifting in the wind, never making it clear whether they reveal or conceil, enlighten or deceive. I liked that as well.

This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff. Its people, from rugged ranchers, to acculturated Navajos & Hopis and the 'traditionals'. And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. "When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere... you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony. To cure them you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it. "Can't miss with this book.

It is easy to forget that Herbert wrote in a time when the Sci-Fi universe was sparsely populated, with technology based on analog vacuum tubes and such. The dazzling world of Arrakis & its worms, space travel technology etc are original and reflect raw imagination and talent. SOme aspects of Robert Jordan's Aes Sedai seem eerily similar to Herbert's Bene Gesserit.I couldn't relate to the all-knowing all-powerful main character who seemed too uni-dimensional to be interesting. literal use of Arabic, Slavonic, Chakobsa, Persian etc was disconcerting and jarring. much of the pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo in Dune seems to have been lifted straight from hallucinogenic trances - the book at times sounded like a diary from a druggie, complete with rapid review of the past and the future. Not surprisingly, the threat of diminished drug supply as a literary device was lifted straight out of another fiend's (Crowley's) oeuvre.Historically speaking this book was ground breaking. Personally, I wasn't as touched as I expected to be.

"Do not talk gosip to other women. Do not speak badly of anyone. Do not tell anyone you have problems - problems are what others will bring to you; you are the queen. If you have trouble, act happy. Now you have to walk behind me. That is how it is done on Yaqui. Oh, and one more thing. When I get up in the morning? I want you to make the bed first thing. Then cook my breakfast - two eggs over easy. One tortilla. "This is how Anselmo Valencia, a headman of the Yaqui Pasqua reservation, proposed his Anglo wife-to-be. The book is basically a compilation of Heather Valencia's more or less disastrous relationships with men up to the Yaqui chief that she meets at a deer dance in the Pasqua village. Valencia reveals a pattern of being controlled throughout her life by assorted husbands, medicine men, football stars etc trying to force her into adopting THEIR lifestyle, interests, values and passions. The Yaqui chieftain, clearly a remarkable and influential guy, is no different, only more canny and confident in making her fit into his universe. But, in contrast to others, he also gives something in return.Perhaps to compensate for the constrictedness of daily life, Valencia shifts into the dreaming universe and art-making. The book chronicles her experiences in which dreaming seemlessly morphs into reality, with characters from one merging into the other. We learn about unknown women who 'teach' her about dreaming in this dreaming domain; many of these women would eventually turn out to be Yaquis from the Pasqua reservation. This part resembles earlier works of Castaneda and Lynne Andrews and as in Castaneda, the reader is tempted sometimes to suspend her/his disbelief.This book also shows Heather's resourcefulness, toughness and ability to manifest her many talents, including painting and community work. Depictions of Native Americans in this book seem real, certainly more real than cartoonish characters from Andrews' books. There are a number of interesting details about Yaqui deer dancing, customs, etc. and astute and valuable descriptions of Indian perception, healing traditions, singing. Those were the parts that interested me the most: the impressions of an adopted outsider of Yaqui customs and behavior.

This is a spectacular movie in which we get the opportunity to see acting by some of the best actresses of our time.The film asks how is it possible for an individual to exercise his/her freedom in order to break free from a situation that stifles creative growth. The surge into freedom is never black and white and is never penalty-free. .... for example, in order to survive the bland, de-humanizing cliches of the '50ies "family life" the Moore character had to abandon her family and child.Subsumed in the main three stories, which only come together at the end (in a masterful stroke of screen-writing and directing) are several metaphorical streams opening (but never closing) the questions of intimacy, creative spirit and (emotional, physical and creative) survival. Daldry ties together the three narrative threads by using parallel montage, sometimes by using the same motives or just the color of the clothes.This is a deeply inspiring film, a true work of art. It shows little compromise with the Lowest Common Denominator. I think that the fact that the movie and its actors were side-stepped during Oscar finals says much about this commercialized and artistically irrelevant farce.

This book is valuable for many reasons. First and foremost, it presents us with the views and attitudes of one of the world's foremost anthropologist-explorers from the beginning of the 20th century. This means lots and lots of passion and enthusiasm, a willingness to risk one's life in pursuit of an elusive goal and an ability to follow one's gut instincts. All traits which, sadly, have practically dissapeared from modern anthropology. In addition, of course, the book is permeated with the spirit of the times (1910-40ies) - which means patronizing attitudes toward the natives (the "savages", who for the most part clearly resented the tasks of having to clear the jungle, build bridges across impassable rapids and climb hills infested with snakes) and an eurocentric view of the world which now seems a bit naive.All this being said, I must emphasize that this book is a treasure and a must read for anyone about to visit Macchu Picchu - if only to contrast the conditions encountered by Bingham and his Indians to those that exist today, when busloads of clueless tourists are delivered straight to the Temple of the Sun. The first third of the book consists of a superb Introduction including a recapitulation of the16th century records of the Incas and their empire (including the awesome Pachakuti Inca), very competent review of Inca technology (many of their and an excellent recapitulation of the life stories of the last 4 Incas. The last part describes the actual "discovery" of Macchu Picchu which occured by procuring, for a silver coin, the services of Anacleto Alvarez, a local Qechua who had been living among the ruins all along. Macchu Pichu therefore had never been truly "lost" and "discovery" has in this context many interesting connotations.For my part, I have a respect for Bingham and for his guts that served him so well. In time, for example, they led him to the US Senate (from Connecticut). I suspect it will take many a pachakuti (turning of the Wheel of Time) till another anthropologist gets an opportunity to represent Democracy and the People.

heh...the words on the jacket: "a deliciously disturbing and erotically charged thriller"... are rather shameless hyperbole.Instead, this film is remarkable for one thing alone: how the director squanders acting talent and beauty (Salma Hayek, Chiara Mastroianni, Ornella Muti, Lucy Liu!), financial resources, and the luminous backdrop of Venice to produce a film that is not even a flop but rather resembles an uncut first year film student's independent project... a very average project, that is.The words that come to mind are 'breathless', 'pretentious' and 'incompetent'. Generally, the designation "art film" means that the director is unable to focus or use a script and needs to resort to gimmickry. this certainly is true for the Hotel. The 'macabre' we see is simply an excuse for Figgis' lack of imagination; the exquisite Dutchess of Malfi text is abused rather than used. The two good scenes (with John Malkovich, in the beginning; the flamenco scene in the middle) are never developed.My basic issue with the film is that it is basically soul-less.This is not due to Figgis' incompetence alone. The film should never have been produced.Come to think of it, The Hotel should be required viewing for film students, a lesson in how great actors and a lot of money are not enough to make a good flick. There is something else.

In the recent years there has been a surge of interest in indigenous tribal life and practices, as Western peoples start to feel the stirrings of their own indigenous tribal souls and go looking for answers to those who still possess the connection with the Land and the Spirit. While a lot has been published about Native American (both North and South), Tibetan, Altaic, Celtic etc. tribal life, rather little is known about Africa. Malidoma Some's book therefore provides a welcome and highly inspiring contribution.With this book Malidoma ('Be Friends With the Enemy') creates a bridge into a world where a person's life is linked inextricably to the breathing of his village and where his destiny interlocks with that of his ancestors, his children and the rhythms of nature. It is a world imbued with meaning; the Dagara share it with tree and animal spirits, with supernatural entities (the kontomble, the "star people") and with ancestors who provide guidance and support. Malidoma also addresses topics of universal importance to all of us. What is a complete human being? Why does one need to be "initiated" into living in order to be "real"? How do we awaken and use all the resources stored in the "inner museum of our being"; what is the role of mystery and awe in the unfolding of our destinies and how does one learn to become available to them?The book is written along the lines of ancient storytelling, and in a flowing delicate prose which radiates human warmth and respect for life. MS does a great job in depicting the Dagara as a spiritually aware people still attuned to their roots and their land. I understand that now, after his father's death, Malidoma has returned to Africa (temporarily abandoning his privileged and lucrative position within the Western "shamanic circuit") to assume his duties as a leader of his clan and as a mediator between the worlds that his people still remember and give homage to. He is a savy man who demonstrated to us all that befriending the enemy brings gifts to all involved in the process as it combines and integrates different yet complementary pools of knowledge. Myself I listen with deep appreciation and respect as the Dagara sing:I want to be what I know I am,And take the road we alwaysForget to take.Because I heard the smellOf the things forgottenAnd my belly was touched.

This book represents an impressive interdisciplinary attempt at presenting the biological, psychological and cultural context of moral action. Hauser (and i guess his graduate students) has compiled data from an array of disciplines - animal behavior, developmental psychology, sociology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy/ethics/logic to show that what we consider to be "moral" is highly conditioned by biology (the innate revulsion at engaging in evolutionary non-advantageous behavior) and culture (say, the different attitudes towards 'honor killings' in Afghanistan and Norway). Morality presents us with countless conundrums and paradoxes, which are eloquently described by Hauser (eg, several versions of the well-known "trolley dilemma"). It would seem that moral action ultimately depends on self-awareness - the individuation of the sense of self, and its recognition that life is not about selfish accumulation of goods and status but rather that real pleasure derives from being 'part of the bigger picture'.I enjoyed this book, and in my opinion the author (who has engendered his own share of ethical dilemmas) is essentially on the right track regarding his elusive subject. If I had an issue with the book it would be its disorganization, a certain opacity, a refusal to synthesize and a tendency to drone and ramble. Nonetheless, this is one of the best works that I've been able to see that presents a wholistic context grounded in real data and common sense. No esoteric philosophizing. If you are willing to grind through the disorganization, you may find this book worthy of your time.

This is a sweet and funny and profound book which warmed up my heart and consistently made me laugh. De Mello was a universally respected Jesuit priest who managed to go far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma and into the very heart of spiritual alivennes and connectedness. Several centuries earlier a similar attempt was made by Loyola, another Jesuit troublemaker; however, in A., DeMello dispenses with the extraneous mumbo jumbo and goes straight to the heart of the matter. God is presence itself and through awareness we are simultaneously connected to who we truly are and to the sacredness of all life. De Mello reminds us time and again of this simple yet profound truth; i especially admire his skilfull use of anecdote and parable, which reminds me of another great spiritual teacher... Perhaps it is not coincidental that De Mello lived and worked in Goa, that syncretic ex-Portuguese colony known for its eccentric inhabitants and practices. What impresses me the most about this book is that DeMello manages to weave into his teachings the best elements of Buddhist and Hindu traditions (their emphasis on awareness, mindfulness) and combines them with what is best in Christianity (the emphasis on love, openness of the heart). In addition to that, he is consistently funny (no mean feat for a work on spiritual matters)... and even manages to be cranky in a way that makes me laugh. Perhaps as importantly, the book shows that Christianity may not be all about biblethumping -in the right hands it is a vibrant, contemporary, compassionate, and profound spiritual practice. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about mindfulness from a master teacher.

This book contains invaluable information about crucial elements of Aztec ritual life, including those of the tonalli, nahualli, the animal guardians, and the great flower of darkness, the Talocan ; there are many wonderful descriptions of the syncretic blend of the pre-Colombian and the Catholic and quite specific descriptions of the ancient technique of Dreaming, used to navigate in the harsh and often unforgiving underworld. The story is told by a master raconteur who introduces us to two wily and remarkable teachers of the old ways, Inocente and Rubia. In a masterful sweep of the history of a small town in the Sierra de Puebla we get to see their roles in the havoc caused by the tension between the indigenous peasants and the mestizo rulers in which the former's only defense were the ancient techniques of &quot;snuffing the candles of the unjust&quot;. K's prose allows the reader to revel in the evocative beauty of Nahuatl and it evokes one's respect and affection for the people he is writing about (in short, this is anthropology at its best). I recommend the book to people interested in exploring the thin line between the real and the imaginary, reality and dreams, and to those who like to witness how the new world and the old world can meet in the spirit of respect, strength and mutual enrichment.

One watches this film and it's, like, perfect. Sheer perfection. The Coen Bros... tuned into an astrological constellation or something, the stars were aligned, and out came a film that is not a film as much as a monument to the art of filmmaking. When you catch that feeling, you can't go wrong. Baby. The film is a testament to friendship, authenticity,untethered life force, the beautiful craziness of SoCal and the sheer genius of directing with a light touch and a clear eye. This was the perfect strike.

I don't know where exactly to put this book - it is partly a memoir, a travelogue, an anthropological study for the lay reader...Vitebsky spent a number of summers with different bands of Eveny, a Tungus tribe in mid Siberia. These Eveny were all associated with a 'State Farm', a Soviet era relic that regulates the use of the territory assigned to the bands, shipping of reindeer meat and antlers and bringing in supplies. The Farm was in this case controlled by an incompetent, alcoholic director and his cronies, who had been responsible for a number of disastrous decisions that had a big impact on the region as a whole.Eveny have been hit hard by Soviet times and even harder in the chaos of the perestroika. They lost their shamans and the number of men willing to spend their winters herding reindeer in the forbidding sub sub zero taiga is decreasing, especially as the women refuse to leave the relative comfort of villages for the traditional nomadic way of life. As Vitebsky trails the herders on their annual migration, he is witnessing the impressive array of skills these people have to survive in one of the most inhospitable regions n this planet; slowly, as he is taken into their confidences, he also sees a part of their life that is hidden from the casual visitor. Although their shamans have all been killed, and the rituals all but stamped out, a number of folk 'superstitions' control all areas of Eveny life. Propitiating spirits of the land, dead ancestors, interpreting omens and dreams all play a central role in Eveny activity. There is a number of striking similarities with NA Indians in the relationship to the land, their respect of silence, mutual assistance and the non verbal communication that happens in that silence. Like the Indians, Eveny don't speak much, but when they do, the words mean something... like the Indians, the Eveny are getting destroyed by alcohol.Vitebsky is mostly interested in social aspects of contemporary Eveny life - social tensions, alliances, intrigues and gossip. Given the tools he has he does a good job in bringing us a portrait of a native community deep in Siberia. Unlike what one might expect, his eveny are no ignorant herders - these guys have been around in schools, the military, they read astronomy, Wittgenstein and Mme Blavatsky and listen daily to radio Moscow; they seemed to be way better informed about the world situation than your average American (which doesn't say a lot).Nevertheless, given its ambitious title, the book somehow does not deliver what it promises, at least it not for me. 'Living with animals and spirits' was missing something, i guess it was animals and spirits. Above all, Vitebsky is all too careful to approach these except through his informants. Now I also know why I am not an anthropologist. It would be very difficult for me to watch the State Farm director destroy people's lives without getting involved in some way; well, V. is an anthropologist and documents the disintegration that occurs with professional detachment. Still, there is good stuff in there and if you are interested in reindeer, this is the book to read.

I find the title of this book to be a bit misleading - it implies a sort of general applicability characteristic of perhaps the large majority of books on &quot;zen&quot; and &quot;Buddhism&quot; which have overwhelmed the market in recent years. Love and work, who wouldn't want to resolve these two koans. Joko Beck, in this book, gives us much more than a series of little chickensoup feel-good stories about love and work. In what is essentially a compilation of her talks for sesshin students, she tries to goad us into what really cannot be expressed, cannot be talked about - into the awareness of the moment. This book therefore cannot be *read*, it has to be *felt* with that mixture of gratitude, abandon, sensitivity and faith that one works on during the sesshin. One therefore cannot use it to &quot;learn&quot; something about zen. As a tool for zen practice, however, i have found it over the years to be invaluable. i come to this book again and again for inspiration and support - i 'd rank it, together with S. Suzuki's Beginner's Mind as the best book on zen practice available to us today. What (arguably) makes it even more valuable to us are its syncretic elements: Everyday Zen is written by a Westerner who sees her life from a perspective of an American, yet it also possesses the sensitivity to the workings of one's mind, the ferocity needed to face the mind's endless evasive maneouvers and a dedication to cultivation of awareness that matches that of any Japanese zen master, indeed, that of any spiritual master anywhere. In short, if you want to practice zen as opposed to &quot;studying&quot; it, this is a book for you.

Stephens writes about what he sees and experiences, with humor, insight and self-effacement that make the books hard to put down. With his two colleagues - a doctor and a painter - he crisscrosses Yucatan, visiting remote villages and paying the unenthusiastic Maya locals to clear the sites of ruins that have been untouched since the conquista. Stephens, while an amateur archeological aficionado was one of the first to connect the buildings at Chichen to Toltecs and their structures at Mitla and Tula, thereby forever changing the field.There are priceless descriptions of local fiestas, village life, relationship between whites, mestizos and Indians, the role of haciendas and the (often beneficial) role of the Church and its hedonistic padres in Yucatecan life. The humorous episodes often include Indios who continue to amaze Stephens with their servility and docility. I was impressed by the courage and determination exhibited by the three adventurers who repeatedly braved bouts of malaria, accidents, exhausting heat, Indian snoring and swarms of garrapatas, fleas and "mosquetoes" to explore stuffy caves, chambers and ruins that were forgotten even by the local villagers. It may be difficult to envisage that ruins in Stephens' day were in many cases small hills covered by the jungle or chaparral, which had to be cleared by human hands. 'Human' in this context of course means 'Maya'. Stephens I believe was one of the first to connect the humble and servile Maya to the fierce and proud warriors who built those incredible ruins. Many a time he meditates within the pages of the 2 volumes on how the Indian culture and Maya's sense of self were altered by living under the white rule. He also wonders how could those fearless conquistadors morph into spoilt and entitled Mexican ruling class. The only institution which seemed to (somewhat) function was the Catholic church. Its priests - carousing with women, drinking and gambling - seemed to be the only ones to care about Indian welfare. The travelers befriended several 'padres' and received much help from them.It is a credit to Stephens that anyone who travels the region will be able to use it as a yardstick with which to relate to local life. Despite the tumultuous history which (one might expect) gives the Maya every right to resent white people, they have retained an extraordinary ability to greet strangers with an open heart and a smile. And a way of life which, while in some ways harsh, is still grounded within the poetry that are the Maya languages, customs and religion. In other words, these are excellent books which became the golden standard for de Plongeon, Morley, de Charnay and the Thompsons who followed S. into Yucatan and are credited with subsequent discoveries. Highly recommended.

This is an excellent CD. Dido's voice vibrates with intelligence and sensitivity and with an aware passion that is all too rare these days. The album is impeccably produced, making it a joy to listen to.Some songs - White Flag, Who Makes You Feel, Life for Rent - I liked immediately. Others, especially Mary's in India and Stoned, grew up on me and are now my favorites.

This a profound film - simple and at times painfully sad. Addresses the humanity's predicament: everyone surreptitiously thinks themselves as great while human minds are in fact petty, opportunistic, dis-empowered gambling machines. Andre is the Everyman.Besson makes a case for truth, love - and breathing - as instruments of divine providence. Truth and love can evoke passion for the divine, for life itself.A cool movie.

...in this fascinating movie. Not often can a director pull off an adaptation of a one act off-off Broadway theater piece into a full feature movie yet Linklater manages to do just that. So did the actors; all three roles required intelligence, emotional sensitivity and instinct that one certainly does not expect from Hollywood icons. In some way this film is already (as it should be) a classic. Myself I kept being reminded throughout of Bergman (&amp; Uma certainly made me think of Liv Ullman).I was also reminded of high school, its pressures and bittersweet romances that can never be forgotten and that, for better or worse, defined life paths for many of us. The first love, the first rejection, the first true friendship... Linklater shows that these can coalesce, blend, and differentiate in an elaborate dance of memories and emotions. What is free will? how do we define ourselves? what is self-respect and how does it stand up to emotional revelations? Why would one want to stay and face the demons from one's past rather than flee into the oblivion of worldly &quot;success&quot;? These are all issues Linklater and his actors distill into a bewildering and intoxicating beverage that makes for fidgety yet irresistible viewing.A lot in this movie (like in any good theater) is left unsaid; in other words, it is left to be conveyed by actors' body language and energetic tone of their emotions. They succeed spectacularly. This movie should be a required part of curriculum of every acting school worthy of its designation. I would especially recommend it to European actors (who often seem to miss the best American productions) and directors (who should know better).

This book is a collection of essays with early Christianity as a (tenuous) link between them. I liked KH accounts of Mani, the originator of Manicheaism, his many examples of early tensions between the Christians and the Jews and, especially, his accounts of the &quot;feverish imagination of the Gnostics&quot;. The core belief of Gnostics is that inside every human there is a spark of divinity, put there from a supreme Divinity which is lodged in the high heavens of outer space. The divinity within each human can be awakened only through a process of contemplation and self-knowledge. It can also be accomplished with the assistance of a divine mediator, such as JC. Although a human instructor can sometimes help, more often than not interference by the &quot;human&quot; dogma can, according to the gnostics, be counterproductive. The gnostic approach to the &quot;teachings of JC&quot; is thus very different from the &quot;catholic&quot; doctrine, which has invested a lot of effort into suppressing individual quest for inner truth in order to establish a universal belief system (for some reason, the efforts by Augustine, Iraeneus, et al. to push a one to-be-accepted-by-all dogma reminded me of the birth of Communism). Hopkins' book is basically a deconstruction of that dogma. The basic idea is that contemporary Christianity is a theological mishmash selected to support the ideological and political interests of bishops during the early AD and today seems rather uncontroversial. The last chapter does a pretty good Job in textual analysis of the 4 canonical gospels and their contextualization into the writer's theological and ideological interests. Personally, I found the accounts of life in the Ptolemaic Egypt and imperial Pompeii a bit slow, although Hopkins does his best to titillate the reader with tidbits of info on Egyptian sex magic ritual practices, Roman sex life and asceticism, which is the religious eroticism of the true Christian (&quot;Laughter&quot;, wrote Clement of Alexandria disapprovingly, &quot;is the prelude to fornication&quot;). In short, this is not an integrated work of scholarship designed to press a theological or historic point. The idea is to entertain and to teach through the many delicious and well-selected morsels. I recommend it.

&quot;in 1935 in a lycee in Paris..our work was divided into two equal parts: the world of today and the world of yesterday, the dreams of the ancients and the dreams of the modern man. I can't believe that was a bad thing. At least we were not in danger of falling into absurdity, so common nowadays, of confusing the era of Sputniks and Polaris rockets with the era of Genesis&quot;.It is hard for me to categorize this book; it is a spiritual book, illuminating one man's relationship with the Spirit; it is a profound meditation on the nature of truth, morality and friendship, and it is a priceless analysis of human nature. Blindness was no impediment to Lusseyran - on the contrary, he learnt to use his senses with an uncanny precision to represent facts by creating visual imagery, to identify the motives that drive people and countries and to establish contact with the transcendental essence of all Being. &quot;People were not at all what they were said to be, and never the same for more than two minutes at a stretch. Some were, of course, but that was a bad sign, a sign that they did not want to understand or be alive, that they were somehow caught in the glue of some indecent passion. ... It is strange that when laws men make are so ticklish in matters concerning the body, they never set limits to nakedness or contact by voice. Evidently they leave out of account the fact that the voice can go further than hands or eyes in licit or illicit touch.&quot;This book is very valuable for its insights on the nature of blindness and sensory-emotional reorganization that accompanies it. &quot;Blindness works like dope, a fact we have to reckon with. ...Like drugs, blindness heightens certain sensations, giving sudden and often disturbing sharpness to the senses of hearing and touch. But, most of all, like a drug, it develops inner as against outer experience, and sometimes to excess&quot; (p.49).I just cannot help myself from quoting from this book, it is so full of unforgettable passages. This is from the time he was caught, as a member of the Resistance, by the Gestapo: (p. 245): &quot;One small piece of advice. IN a spot like this, do not go too far afield for help. Either it is right near you, in your heart, or it is nowhere. It is not a question of character, it is a question of reality. If you try to be strong, you will be weak. If you try to understand, you will go crazy. No, reality is not your charaqcter which, for its part, is only a by-product - I can't define it, a collection of elements. Reality is Here and Now. It is the life you are living in the moment. Don't be afraid to lose your soul there, for God is in it.&quot;As you can see, this book was written by a remarkable man, who could &quot;see&quot; life and truth and humaneness better than many of his fellow men. Now, when our times in some ways resemble the late 30ies and we again seem to be descending into the darkness of ignorance, when the world is run by corrupt, greedy and cynical men who value their comfort above and beyond the dignity of their souls and happiness of their fellow men, Lusseyran's book provides a ray of light and a courage. I salute this amazing man.

This is a priceless book. Suzuki has managed to distill Dogen's message and present it in a way which is both grounding (one into the moment of reading) and inspiring (one to be ever more aware). I have had this book for many years and it would probably have been the first choice for my Desert Island list.I am very impressed by the subtlety with which Trudy Dixon managed preserved Suzuki's impishness and her skills in conveying to us his genuine, good and compassionate heart as well as his unyielding dedication to practice. This is no shouting, riddle-making and stick-wielding rinzai guy - no, in these pages we encounter a gentle, self-deprecating and deeply compasionate master who is teaching us the wisdom of being in the moment, and helping us to find beauty in simplicity and kindness. There is a lot of dharma-power behind these words - Suzuki has been responsible for founding perhaps the largest and most successful zen community in the Western hemisphere. Why? because the sincerity and depth of his practice imbued unshakeable faith in zazen practice to anyone who met him, even for a moment. It will do the same for you. I strongly recommend this book .

This book depicts another white man's life journey in Africa. Miriam Makeba, the famous singer, suggested to James Hall (the author of "Sangoma") that there may be more than meets the eye in his fascination with Africa and African-American women. Hall followed her advice and consulted a Swazi witch doctor ("sangoma") who declared, to surprise of all, that Hall was destined to become a sangoma himself. This book depicts his travails leading to his initiation into the circle of Swazi healers.It was a bittersweet path, filled with encounters with supernatural (Hall turned out to possess access to many different spirits, including those of a Native American, a NY advertising executive and - wait for this - a fetus). In addition to description of his training, Hall provides valuable accounts of his interactions with ordinary Swazis (some good, some bad; there seem to be as many racially intolerant people in Africa as everywhere else) and, especially, with women. Hall shows that relationships between men and women in Swaziland are pragmatic, based on exchange of material goods and services rather than sentimental.Throughout the book we participate in Hall's inner life, his decisions and his torments as well as in his decision to adopt a parentless child and marry the woman he fell in love with. Hall now lives and practices in Swaziland and I think Swazis are lucky to have such a courageous, dedicated, life-affirming and generous sangoma.

...about this book? Seriously, I'd like to know. Granted, TR regales us with dead-Pan views of Life, Universe and Everything. Yet i find the book unfunny and perhaps even boring. ...it is a sentimental, pretentious sigh of nostalgia by a 60/70ies satyr for the psychedelic highs of the good old times. So retro.

Varela was one of the first to champion interactions between phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty), Buddhism and neuroscience. His own contributions to any of these fields are less clear (to me). So I watched this DVD with the hope to learn more about the man and his role in neurophilosophy.This film shows a charming guy living a charmed life - with family, friends, a womanizer with a series of girlfriends, wives and children... playing the superstar "scientist" for throngs of New Age sympathizers and Tibetan Buddhists. Varela's contributions to our understanding of, say, consciousness, remain unclear to me. His statements about the mind seemed trivial and general. The autopoiesis idea that he developed with Maturana is simply that - an impractical idea. Interviews about "a new 1st person science" and bridging the subject-object separation seemed more wishful thinking than anything else.I did like Varela's exhortation for each person (scientist & nonscientist alike) to develop their own perception/inner knowledge. He believes in phenomenology and that is cool.The interviews with Varela and his wife when he was dying were sad.I guess the aim of this film was to do a Festschrift, show Varela as a human being. In that the film succeeds.I liked the naturalness of the Chileans. And the empanada-making was the best.

This book provides valuable information on Tzutujil Maya, their customs, and, especially, practices involved in training their shamans. Readers, interested in shamanism will find many gems... such as description of methods used for "stalking", cultivating the awareness with which one can track, and call to oneself, animals. One gets to marvel at the multi-dimensional properties of the Mayan language, with its different layers reserved for properly initiated youths, adults, elders and shamans - a language, where meaning is deeply embedded into the invisible landscape of spiritual forces which have shaped the history of the Tzutujil. Atitlan is a place, where those forces are still alive, because they are fed by constant acknowledgement based on gratitude and fear and, especially, beauty. The spirits are fed by beauty, says Prechtel, and by grounding our lives in the awareness of beauty surrounding us we support the benevolent unfolding of the universe. With the aid of this book one also gets to understand the importance of the ancestors and the importance of community for the Maya.Prechtel is also very poignant in describing the revolting habit of X-ian "missionaries" who are bent on destroying precious and age old connections between indigenous cultures and their environment. Don't these people have better things to do?

Witherspoon, a professor at the Univ. of Michigan, uses language as an entry way into a world-view and a way of Being that is totally alien to many if not most, Anglos. The Navajo universe was created and organized through language as the thought, conceived by Holy Beings, was projected onto the primordial unordered substance through the compulsive power of speech and song. Language then, is an energetic medium that affects the very entrails of reality. Thought then, for a Navajo, is a creative tool for ordering reality. That's why the ability to speak eloquently, and think beautiful & creative thoughts, is highly praised. A child acquires human status only after it has started to speak.In this book i've found excellent descriptions of the Blessingway ceremony and various other curing rites (designed to recreate the world through myth, song, prayer and language). This includes the best (by far) explanation of the famous Navajo phrase "sa'ah naaghaii bik'eh hozho" that Navajos use to refer to a "beautiful, pleasant and healthy environment". The phrase which represent a maelstrom of meanings is firmly rooted into Navajo mythology and thus often considered untranslatable. Moreover, Clyde Kluckhohn (the 'grandfather of Navajo anthropology) often says that English lacks terms that have simultaneously moral and aesthetic meanings and hence cannot be used to comprehend Navajos.Witherspoon tells us that the principal verb in the Navajo language is not "to be" like in many other languages (including ours); "to be" is of minor importance in Navajo. Instead, the Navajo language contains some 356,200 distinct conjugations of the verb "to go", reflecting emphasis on movement and change. Movement, song, speech and life are, for a Navajo, inseparably linked. What does such ordering of the world - in terms of change and movement, instead of the emphasis on the "self" - mean for the Navajo sense of being in the world? W. explains it all in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down book.The book includes much analysis of genealogical terms and their relationships based on sex, generation, relative age and relative distance. Being born into a clan fixes the social context of the person clearly, precisely and unalterably while the language terms used to negotiate the social and spiritual interactions change depending on the context (the brilliant discussion of k'e terms in Chapter 3). In other words, the Navajo language is analyzed and investigated by W. as an organic aspect of a culture, its evolution and its mythos. This is cultural anthropology & linguistics at its best. A few quotes to get the sense of the book (P.151):"For the Navajo, beauty is not so much in the eye of the beholder as it is in the mind of its creator and in creator's relationship to the created. The Navajo does not look for beauty; he generates it within himself and projects it onto the universe. Beauty is a creation of thought....[...]..the Navajo experience beauty primarily through expression and creation, not through perception and preservation. In the Western world beauty as a quality of things to be perceived is, in essence, static; to the Navajo, however, beauty is an essential condition of man's life and is dynamic. It is not in things so much as it is in the dynamic relationships among things and between man and things. Man experiences beauty by creating it.With regard to the two different views of art it is not surprising that Navajo society is one of artists (art creators) while Anglo society consists primarily of nonartists who view art (art consumers). The Navajo find it incomprehensible that we have more art critics than we have artists, and more art collectors than we have art creators (sic!). Nearly all Navajo's are artists and spend a large part of their time in artistic creation. All Navajos are singers and most Navajos have composed many songs."A healthy resepct for language, its relationship to thought and natural environment also allows for intimacy between man and Earth. Witherspoon writes: "Four times I observed the rain ceremony performed on days with clear skies, and each time it rained within 12 hours of the conclusion of the rite, which lasted only a few hours. Only once, however, was the rain significant enough to be of some help"and so on. very cool. very informative. The book is prefaced by no other than Clifford Geertz! One conclusion reached by GW is that Navajo art and thought have much to offer contemporary philosophy, art and spirituality and to our understanding of connections between mental and physical phenomena. by looking into the symbolic dimensions of language we dive directly into the primordial origin of thought and its relationship to reality, to what is real. Witherspoon knows this & presents it beautifully. highly recommended.

This book comes closer to illuminating the origin and nature of human behavior than many philosophical and psychological works. De Waal,a world's authority on the subject of primates, describes in this fascinating book his personal experiences with chimps and bonobos. What makes these experiences even more fascinating is de Waal's ability to put them into a larger framework of universal evolutionary forces driving primate emotion, behavior and intellect. Far from representing a simple autobiographical accountthis work is an ambitious and far-reaching analysis of why we humans are what we are, an attempt to reach into causes that millions of years ago forced Australopithecines to abandon tree branches for biped life.What I got from the book was an insight that we it comes to emotional and social life we humans are hardly different from bonobos and chimps.We share behavioral strategies with chimps (aggression, extermination wars, male-dominated social hierarchy) and bonobos (sex throughout the year, cooperation etc); what makes us different is formation of stable monogamous pairs. That, in turn, drove human social organization. The delicate care with which a chimp may treat a wounded bird, machiavellian machinations and strategies used by chimp males to obtain and maintain social power, wars between neighboring chimp 'tribes', adultery and the need for affection, belonging and love are something are all too 'human'. De Waal describes how, in contrast to chimps and humans, the incessant male jockeying for power is absent in bonobos because the power is all in the hands of old females. For better or worse, bonobo males are henpecked, each and every one of them. Consequently, and in contrast to chimps and humans, are no wars in bonoboland. Instead there is sex, lots of it.The book is superbly written, amazingly easy to read, and there is much understated and elegant humor. De Waal makes a good job relating primate behavior to current political affair(e)s. Above all, one can discern in this work a passionate concern of a humanist and scientist who is devoted to his animal subjects/friends and who is able to tackle directly and in an innovative fashion important questions often taken as prerogatives of philosophers and other non-scientists. Highly recommended.

The film begins with two sombre screens covered with gothic script: " 20 years ago Germany was defeated in the Great War... 20 months ago, new Hope arose!" The camera then focuses on the single wing airplane gliding above the clouds, over medieval cathedrals, castles and houses of Nuremberg. There is the implication of the triumphant meeting between History and Today (i.e., 1934). And then Hitler disembarks amidst solemn ceremony and pomp, surrounded by assorted rascals, thugs and hangers on.This is a fascinating film which should be required reading for every film student. Masterful use of sound, special effects, editing and especially, a new application of modern media to harness the propaganda power of symbol and myth. There is nothing intellectual about intricately choreographed Nazi ceremonies, the nightly torch-lit saturnalia, siegheiling and endless marches. Riefenstahl is interested in tribal stuff encompassing the relationship between individual and the collective mind. The camera zooms in from pseudo-Roman battle standards and goose-stepping SS/SA legions to individual faces that seem to glow with joy & ecstasy. The message to young German men and women is not subtle: uniforms and war games are cool. Who wouldn't want to prance about with a flashy uniform and a sword? Who wouldn;t want to make babies with those soldiers? You can see it in women's eyes. i wondered how many of those bright-eyed men and women were still alive 10 years later. Probably not that many.Riefenstahl shows us a wannabe-Wagnerian Germany rising like a phoenix from the ashes of Versailles. "The future... belongs to us", screams Hitler. The man seems filled with rage and resentment, displaying narcissist confidence and hypnotic clarity together with an intriguing inner emptiness. Unlike his sidekicks many of whom read from prepared notes, Hitler seemed to always know what he wanted to say: subjugate your personal will to that of the Party and the Nation, "unsere Deutsches Nation". His smirks reminded me of a kid who pulled off a prank, or a bad actor. The thugs around him - Streicher, Goebbels, Goering, Hess, Himmler - were actors as well yet unlike the boss, these guys squeaked their "Heils", sweated and tried hard to seem hard.The film works through visual effects, catchy military tunes, manufacturing and fanning of national pride. There is little spoken commentary/narrative apart from Hitler's speeches and a few sycophantic phrases from Goebbels et al.. The banality of the pomp, the banality of the evil underlying it is what is scary, as is the ease with which a civilized people threw away individuality and intellect.Riefenstahl is widely considered as one of the greatest female filmmakers of the 20th century. This phenomenally conceived and executed film received the 1935 gold medal at the Venice film festival and the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937 but also cost her her career. As far as I am concerned, her most impactful and courageous work was performed years later in the Nuba mountains, in which she bravely documented the plight of the Nuba people against the genocidal onslaught of Janjaweed-alikes and the Sudanese army.

In this well-produced DVD, Shiva Rea guides the viewer from early warmup vinyasa-like exercises towards ever more trancy, chaotic release movements. I can understand why a DVD like this was bound to be produced by somebody; someone somewhere who enjoys both yoga and trance dancing would try combining the two... and in this case it turns out to be (appropriately named) Shiva. However, I have mixed feelings about this DVD, and the approach itself.The DVD is set in a sand dune desert, with a group of well-muscled good-looking young people following proscribed exercises. Unfortunately, the yoga-like dynamic postures in the beginning of the DVD were way too brief. While I like dynamic "flow"-like movements, I like to get into them - giving the body time to "get it"; instead, Rea transitions from one movement to the next without giving the viewer a real chance to enjoy what is going on.A more serious concern is that this DVD, at least in my mind, negates the very essence of trance dancing. Trance (especially hard core styles such as goa trance) is about letting go, about allowing the (personal and group) energy to take over. It is about surrendering to the ecstasy of the body in its connection to the transcendent. In contrast, the DVD is composed of 5 minute segments that jerk you out of the trance just as you were about to enter it. Programmatic, lecture-style approach to trance dancing as featured in this DVD may in fact represent the very antithesis of trance. Consistent with this, the 'demonstrators' in the DVD appeared to be much more concerned with looking good than with enjoying the dance.This is not a bad DVD. Rather, imo, it is kind of missing the point. In other words, when doing yoga, do yoga. When trance dancing, allow the dance to take over without any regard for form, time, place or skill.

This is a sensitive, sophisticated film about the human condition. Schnabel does not capture only the mind of a middle-aged man "locked-in" into his head, but also the microscosmos of people who raised, loved and took care of him after the incapacitating stroke. These people, and the French rehabilitation system, are very much central to the film as the American spectator watches - sometimes a bit enviously - the care and attention to personal dignity that epitomizes French healthcare.Anyway. The film is brilliant. Schnabel creates suspense by masterfully introducing elements into the story (Bauby's comprehension that he is not heard; his face; his family). The real & imagined, dreams & fantasy, memory and real-time are mixed together seamlessly. While the director does not want to shield the spectator from the empathic pain, he also shows a man who - having lost the ability to move everything but his eye muscles, also kept his sense of humor and sarcasm, and his talent for hurting those close to him. The last scene where the wife picks up the telephone call from the mistress for whom Bauby left his family is heartbreaking. The scene where they are suturing his eyelids is profoundly painful.The actors are superb, including the women in main supporting roles. Camera: brilliant. In other words, this film is a masterpiece.

I couldn't put the book down. Pretty Shield takes the reader by the hand and takes him/her into the times when buffalo were a-plenty, there was always a danger of a Lakota or Cheyenne raid, a grizzly behind the corner - yet there was always laughing, joy, aliveness and community. Growing up as a child was not being sheltered from the vicissitudes of life - on the contrary, it was taking life seriously by playing in it. It was living on the edge; and only by living on the edge one can really be alive.One learns so much more from a book like this than from anthropological literature.The title says "medicine woman" probably at the insistence of the publisher. While there may not be much about 'Crow Medicine' in the factual, "Western' sense of the word, the medicine - the power of life - creeps out of almost every page. The confidence, the taking-care of her family is a manifestation of her Medicine; the story-telling, the knowledge about the animal and little "People" (spirits), how one gets to meet them and gets their help and the stories of healing that these days could only be classified as miraculous, can be told only by someone who knows what they are talking about. In other words, Pretty Shield teaches obliquely, like the Indians do, through stories. And this book delivers them with sensitivity, respect and simplicity which show that Linderman learnt something about Crows and their medicine.

It seems from the reviews here people either love the film (social satire, etc) or hate it (bad humor, pornographic). At least to me, these POVs are peripheral to the main character of this 'film', which is Cohen's psyche.Cohen's gig is to bring out the foibles in 'fellow' humans so that they can be mocked. The man is basically a sociopath who makes a living using other people, shocking them and, if at all possible, degrading them. In Bruno and Borat, the man wreaked havoc across lives of dozens of ordinary people so that HE could have his 5 minutes in the sun. That, my friends, is psychopathy. Is it such a revelation that some people are racist and others homophobic? Do you feel better about yourself after watching those hapless swingers, hillbillies and Ron Paul?Watching the film we laughed - like you did - yet all i feel now is emptiness. There seems to be a fundamental ugliness within Cohen himself, like the man has a dirty soul which soils everything it touches. We laugh, but we laugh from that dark place filled with Schadenfreude of the unlived adolescent. Cohen understands that very well and panders to it, with his hordes of lawyers and enablers. So I would not call this comedy, or 'film'. It is more of a morality play along the lines of medieval jesters, Fools Nights and saturnalia when human deviancy was allowed to touch the light of the day. Only, with Sacha, deviancy is the norm, and on the surface. Too bad for his friends. And audiences.

Here we get a fascinating account of how a Zulu shaman gets called to his profession and what healing and divination entail in the context of South African native healers (sangomas). Mutwa brings in details that I haven't seen anywhere else... for example, how divination bones, the essential aspect of sangoma art, are obtained and how a combination of plants and energy are used in healing mentally and physically sick people. He talks about ancient power objects held in storage by his tribe and about the knowledge, accumulated by his tribe of hundreds of years, of the alternate reality that one can encounter in the bush. Above all, this book allows one to one witness the sophistication of the Zulu, including their techniques for training and retraining the initiate's perception and awareness.This is a valuable book.

I guess everything that needs to be said about the actors, the set and the story has been said here, many times over. .My hat is off to the Japanese actors and the costume & set designers. The atmospheric element in this movie is stunning; for example, the first charge of the samurai in that misty forest, is unforgetable. I loved the ninja attack. This is one of the few recent productions in which the masculine is portrayed in a wholesome manner: the warrior spirit, the camaraderie, the honor, and the respect for the inner peace that is brought by zen meditation practice, are brought out very well.While the script was IMO kinda clichey & mediocre, Cruise's acting was not bad and rather subtle for a scientologist :) Zimmer's music was predictably good (if less conspicuous as in, say, Black Hawk Down) and if you're into kendo or swordsmanship, well, you will want to see this film several times.

i see this film as a (romantic) French version of Mad Max :). Or rather, its antipode. It hits all the spots for me - sparse, funny, sad, inspiring, depressing, quirky, unpredictable... a vignette into things, feelings, experiences that really matter. Creativity. Friendship. Eros! Decency! Integrity! which can be found in the most unexpected of places.Besson showed the world that he can make a phenomenal movie with little money, a lot of imagination and one of the most beautiful women of all time.The dubbing was awful. And i guess the film, with its accents and slangs is untranslatable anyway.Yet - to see a master at work is always a treat.

"Here, the wife is pronounced the husband's property, as much as his manservant, his ox, or his horse. The government of the wife is therefore placed in the husband by the law of God, for he is the head."from a 1842 Mormon manifesto)"Whenever I see a pretty woman, I have to pray for grace"Joseph Smith, the first Mormon prophet)According to Krakauer, wherever the historical Mormon church went in its search of Zion, its first act was to seek political power. 'Gentiles' were excluded from business and, if they complained, punished. Krakauer's descriptions of the "Prophet" Joseph Smith, a treasure hunter (but also a religious and psychic genius) are scathing. When God speaks to a man and tells him he is the new prophet and must now take the charge of the only new church, often the first command to the man is to become polygamist. To satisfy his libido, Smith was compelled to create a new 'faith' that codified narcissism, delusions of grandeur and sexual addiction:"If any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another...then he is justified; he cannot commit adultery, for they are given unto him. [...] But if either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery and shall be destroyed." (The Mormon Bible)Between 1840 and 1844 God instructed Smith to marry some forty women, some of them horrified teenagers between 14 and 16 years old. As Krakauer documents in this book, the abuse of young women and girls has continued in a semi-legal fashion to this day. Abduction and rape of Elizabeth Smart were inspired by classical Joe Smith rhetoric. Assorted FLDS prophets have created Taliban-like microstates at the border of Arizona/Utah, in southern Canada and Texas where underage girls are married off as plural wives to prophets' cronies whereas young men are expelled. Such proto-pedophilic rings are rarely investigated and still more rarely prosecuted; in Utah being caught DUI can be worse than being indicted as a polygamist. Much of the book is devoted to the Lafferty family, where 5 brothers fell under the sway of FLDS rhetoric and in the process destroyed their marriages, families, material well-being, sanity and freedom - a process that culminated in a gruesome murder of a rebellious wife and her daughter.Krakauer uses Mormonism and its pursuit of obedience, power and wealth as an example of how easily people who have been indoctrinated by paranoia and fear surrender their free will. When Oliver Cowdery, Smith's "assistant prophet" also began speaking to Our Heavenly Father, God told him that Joe has become corrupt and now he, Cowdery, was the new chosen one. This was a lesson for Smith: Cowdery was promptly excommunicated and Smith had a new prophecy: from then on, revelation was possible only within the man's personal dominion of control. A man's "revelation" gives him total control over wife and children just as he, in turn, must obey those higher up in the hierarchy. Today, power within the LDS community is wielded by a gerontocratic hierarchy of "Apostles" who demand absolute obedience. Questioning authority is viewed as a subversive act that undermines faith and is punished by excommunication, as discovered by scholars and women who have question its patriarchal elements. LDS dogmatism may be eerily Taliban-like. "When the prophet speaks, the debate is over".The book is not perfect - it's written as a somewhat superficial documentary in which a (biased) history of the Mormon church is interspersed with the Lafferty saga. There is minimum effort at reflection or analysis as K. seems to believe that facts speak for themselves.Positive sides of Mormonism are not discussed. For example, the physiological and spiritual benefits of magic underwear. The glory inherent in ruling your own planet and its resident womenfolk. The economical advantage of multiple wifedom. The ease and simplicity inherent in having wise Elders telling you who to vote for. Confidence knowing that 10% of your income will be spent on worthy causes instead of tequila, weed and women of ill repute. Last but not least, the opportunity to heed Glenn Beck, Esq., as your wordly, constitutional and spiritual authority and investment adviser.Lo! and it came to pass that the righteous inherited the fruits of the Earth. If you read Krakauer's book it may occur to you that the power with which an organized religious system takes over spontaneity, free will and workings of a community cannot be underestimated - not in Kandahar, and not in the US of A. Obedience to authority undermines the very essence of spiritual quest and poisons personal relationship to Spirit. After all, says Prophet Smith:"God that sits enthroned is a man like one of you", and "God Himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man" -- that means that God's deputies in Salt Lake City likewise have divine authority over their flocks, as do men over their women. David Brian Mitchell justified his atrocious acts by using the language of Joe Smith who himself copied his "Bible" upon mishmash of King James Old Testament and occultist/Freemason works. Mormonism was, in effect, the Scientology of the 19th century. Will the sheeple ever learn?!

the Williams character creepy? I am not so sure. If there was anything creepy in this idiosyncratic movie it was the bland anonymity of the American Wal-Mart (the &quot;Sav-mart&quot;) with its enforced fake smiles with which the employees (the &quot;associates&quot;) are exhorted to meet the shopping clients and the sublimated brutality which underlies the ruthless corporate machine that dehumanizes both the buyer and the seller. I am convinced part of the unease with which the average American meets this movie originates in the guilt he/she/we feel acknowledging the treatment we give these faceless &quot;associates&quot; in our shopping complexes. Romanek provides us with an insightful visual vignette commentary which suggests that whenever we overlook another human being we become less human ourselves.My dominant response to Sy &quot;the photo guy&quot; was that of sadness. Sadness over the loneliness of a man who was never allowed to grow and unfold, who has been forced to suppress his rage so that all that remained was a bland, sterile facade with no inner life; someone who has found meaning only in other people's (perceived) happiness. Do we see here any parallels with latter day obsession of the masses with celebrity and status? Is your regular B. Spears or NASCAR afficionado just another version of &quot;the photo guy&quot;?This movie is about Sy's yearning for simple things - family life, love, connectedness. He believes, like so many of us, that other people could bring us happiness... if only..... The detective understands this, in the end, with a mixture of sadness, pity and even affection. Romanek did a great job with little money. And Robbins' performance was simply stunning - it was nuanced, forceful and sophisticated. This may not be a movie to entertain friends with ... but it certainly is a movie that made me think, feel and investigate. I recommend it.

I assumed that "Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice" was going to tell us about apprenticeship, by a Westerner, to a rain forest shaman. Well I suppose this was a bit naive of me - rather, this book describes a foray, by a sponsored "ethnobotanist" (which is a code word for scientists typically sponsored by pharmaceutical industry, who case the globe for pharmacologically active substances; they've had many success stories, such as the yew tree used to treat ovarian cancer) who went to the Amazon to engage indigenous shamans and learn from them the recipes that could be used in the West following extraction of biologically active ingredients. The "apprenticeship" seems to be a form of double-speak designed to attract buyers. I don't like that.I don't want to engage in the debate of whether and under what circumstances such behaviour is ethical or not. It is my understanding, however, that in most cases the shaman "recipes" are inextricably linked to his "power" and the cosmology of the specific tribe he belongs to. Thus they may be, or they may be not, utterly ineffective in other hands.As Plotkin "searches for new medicines in the rain forest" he indeed plonks into some humorous situations. Whether these can be seen as a hero's journey well that is for the reader to decide for herself. In my case, I expected a book about Amazon spirituality. Unfortunately there are no - seriously, nada - insights about shamanism or entheogenic plants. What I got was glamorizing of a bioprospector story working for the pharmaceutical industry.I do think this book fits well within a wider discourse of bioprospecting and the cultural and spiritual dialogue that is taking place as we speak between the Indians and non-Indians in the Amazon basin. It has nothing, nothing to do with shamanism. Or apprenticeship. The title is pure deception.

I decided to reread my copy, autographed in NYC a long time ago, on a whim. Wasn't as impressed as I had been then. The basic idea is clever and the book can be funny at times. Eco is at his best depicting the Aldo Moro - Berlinguer era Italy when it was fashionable to be a maoist-trotskyist. The highlight of the book are the depictions of Northern Italian WWII scenes with interactions between fascist, partisan and Badoglio sympathizers because Eco understands the Piedmontese peasant in his bones. This i found immensely satisfying. Belbo's stories reflect something true, something that you can hear in the villages and hills around Alessandria. There are a few great people portraits - Garamond, Belbo, Lorenza Pellegrini and assorted "Diabolicals". The depiction of umbanda was excellent.While Eco clearly invested a tremendous amount of work into FP the work is uneven as a whole. The narrative seemed progressively more vapid and superficial as it neared the end - which in itself was anti-climactic. Like watching a balloon deflate. Everything is overintellectualized. Eco is cursed by the Semiotic Deity: no matte how hard he tries, he cannot breathe a whiff of eros into his scenes. While making fun of the pretentious self-righteous quackery typical of much of the contemporary occult scene he misses the very essence, the archetypal power of medieval alchemical texts he quotes in the book. It is easy to mock, but when mockery has no substance than it kind of falls flat. It is bizarre - the guy knows how to read between the lines, gets the ideas and can point the proverbial finger to the moon. I guess he misses the moon because the act of seeing is so simple, humble and unassuming. The snobbery, the literary posturing of it all made this reader feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled.

With respect to originality and sheer poetic intensity, I consider Mutter to be one of the better Rammstein projects. Typical 'Tanz Metal' with overwrought drama, great rhythm and good lyrical sense. Lots of crowd pleasers. Rammstein songs tend to repeat themselves with respect to the rhythm and singing; there are 3-4 motifs that can be identified in almost every R. piece.Still, these guys are cynical and tongue in cheek, they mock us with them rainy graves, cold moons, demons screaming in the darkness:"Der kalte Mond in voller Prachth&ouml;rt die Schreie in der Nachtund kein Engel steigt herabnur der Regen weint am Grab.."

The title itself suggests the tension inherent in two polarities that permeate our lives as human beings: that between the logos and the mythos and the polarity between authentic religious experience as opposed to religious activity in the context of social and political life. The logos cannot address questions of ultimate meaning often leaving the mythos at the mercy of aggression and fear fueled by politics disguised as religion. Armstrong shows how the fundamentalists have managed to turn the mythos of their religion into logos by insisting their dogmas are scientifically true or by transforming a complex mythology into a simplified, consumer-ready ideology. The notion that &quot;my God is different from yours&quot; which is seen as patently false and absurd by the mystic is nurtured by the fundamentalist in order to justify the defense of their community against real or perceived threats. Armstrong shows us how the fundamentalist mindset found in all 3 major monotheistic religions has developed through time. She discusses the sunni and shiite Moslems facing pressure by the colonial and ideological pressures from the British, Russians and (later) Americans and the Gush Emunim settlers trying to secure the land for settlements by importing hundreds of thousands of Jews into the West Bank with the aim to colonize all the strategic mountaintops. For them, a settlement was rationalized as &quot;tikkun&quot;, an act of restoration that would one day transform the world and thus &quot;God's command to conquer the land was more important than the human and moral considerations of the national rights of the gentiles to our land&quot;; this in turn fueled a major radicalization of the Arab population. This also includes Protestants seeking to &quot;compel other men to walk in the right way&quot; (what kind of society did the Puritans try to establish in New England? A democracy? Not on your life!) not to mention the Catholics who have used religion for centuries as an excuse to establish empires and suppress internal political dissensions and whose actions were going against explicit teachings laid out in the gospels.This book will be invaluable to anyone looking for an unbiased sourcebook on development of fundamentalism. In addition, it provides a lot of food for thought for anyone uncomfortable with societal pressures to conform one's inner life to an established &quot;creed&quot; , i.e., to subjugate one's logos to the communal mythos ... .

I'm too alone in the world, yet not alone enoughto make each hour holy.I'm too small in this world, yet not small enoughto be simply in your presence, like a thing-just as it is.One can approach this translation as a purist, eyeing the metre like a hawk or as a lover of beauty. how many music "lovers" do we know who can extol this tenor or that, this composer or that, but are unable to simply relax into the music, like dropping into a feather bed?! This translation is a feather bed; it may be made of fake materials, but who cares - the words, the images, the meanings are so delicate and close to the heart that it warms up and then one's intellect ceases to care. Let us not be too tight. Or as Rilke says:I want to unfold.let no place in me hold itself closed,for where I am closed, I am false.

What can I say? I love this series. Can't see how a regular guy can't be enthralled by the Hank character, a hip version of a Bukowski or Tom Waits, only cooler and less of a space alien. Whiffs of Henry Miller across the board. Duchovny captures what many of us are looking for... spontaneity, character and, when it counts, integrity. And frivolity. The show was basically made to cater to the man's fantasies. What a way to turn a vice into virtue....The main weakness, for me, is in the 'writer' character. Hank lounges about, hangs out, flirts, californicates, parties, fights - but does not write; when, miraculously, he gets to sit behind the typewriter it feels weak & unconvincing. Kapinos could apparently not be bothered to put in some decent prose. That's lazy. I mean, he could've copied something from the Tropic of Cancer. the plot gets kind of repetitive as the novelty wears off.At least there are wimmyn in this LA telenovela, with a principal heroine that is close to irresistible! the scriptwriting mostly good, the acting fine, music excellent, the show produced with a light touch, Duchovny like a fish in the water. i imagine filming has been a lot of fun and it shows.

Today's science originated in the renaissance as part of a curiously retro movement devoted to resurrecting old Latin and Greek texts and ideas. When Corpus Hermeticum, a compilation of neoplatonist and gnostic texts arrived from Byzantium to the Medici court, old Cosimo was on his deathbed yet had it translated so he could read it right away. Here is an excerpt:"Unless you make yourself equal to God, you cannot understand God: for the like is not intelligible save to the like. ..... Draw into yourself all sensations of everything created, fire and water, dry and moist, imagining that you are everywhere, on earth, in the sea, in the sky, that you are not yet born, in the maternal womb, adolescent, old, dead, beyond death. If you embrace in your thought all things at once, times, places, substances, qualities, quantities, you may understand God."Yates uses CH as a wedge with which to illuminate a great battle fought at the end of the 16th century between the Vatican's military-political machine and its "freedom-loving" opponents. The CH texts (XI of them) were seized upon by a motley group of philosophers, cabalists, alchemists and magicians across Europe including Pico della Mirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, Giordano Bruno, Robert Fludd and Marsilio Ficino as well as the future Borgia pope, Alexander VI. It just so happens that many of these 'magicians' also represented the first promoters and practitioners of the black empirical art that we today call science. Interest in CH was denounced both by conservative Catholics, who immediately recognized esoteric-hermeneutic competition when they saw it and by rationalists like Erasmus who were unable to follow the hermetist's imagination. The first half of Yates' book barely mentions Bruno as it lays out the context and describes the protagonists of pro-, non- and anti-Catholic versions of European hermeticism. Here she seems to champion a new, brave and unorthodox view that stresses the implications of hermetic tradition for Western philosophy, politics and science. Once you think about it, it makes perfect sense.I always wondered about the occult & pseudo Egyptian symbols that one sees painted on the chamber walls of Vatican's residences. Yates explains the Church was not opposed to 'magic' as long as the 'magicians' recognized the primacy of Christian ideas and beliefs. Which Ficino and della Mirandola were happy to do; Agrippa paid it lip service - while Bruno denounced it loudly and clearly. Bruno's sin for which he paid with his flesh had little to do with science or cosmology. According to Yates his situation was completely different from Galileo's. The man was not burned for having championed a competing view of the solar system. Rather, Bruno was first betrayed (by a rich Venetian merchant who invited him for a visit) and sentenced to death for having revised basic tenets of hermeticism into a new kind of magic which excluded Christian dogma and symbolism. Bruno, an ex-dominican friar himself, assaulted the very foundation of the Church's claim to political and spiritual supremacy. For example, in Bruno's system of magic, Sun did not represent Jesus Christ, Corpus Hermeticum predated Christ for thousands of years and Egyptian and cabalistic symbols replaced Christian ones. This the Inquisition could not accept. Catholic Church, after all, has always been about power, worldly and otherwise.While naive, Bruno's hereticism was also conscious and passionate. Yates, who is a Bruno champion, does not hide the man's foibles: grandiosity, political naivete, querulousness, garrulousness, occasional cowardice as he hurtled around Europe as a patronage-seeking missile. The counterpoint to lack of common sense, however, was Bruno's love for truth, his unceasing study and knowledge of hermetic, esoteric and mnemonic symbology, his total dedication to freedom of man - and, ultimately, his mission to humanize the impersonal monolith that was the Catholic Church of the XVIth century. Yates' writing makes Bruno human, I liked that. It also creates, seamlessly, a context for the Western philosophical-spiritual tradition that stretches from Pythagoras, through Plotinus, Nicolas of Cusa to Husserl and neurophenomenology of today.Yates' knowledge and understanding of historical and esoteric minutiae is profoundly inspiring and illuminating. She shows us an age in which science, mysticism, philosophy, religion and politics were not separate, but rather - for better or worse - essential for defining people's views of reality. The book is a great read, full of surprises and treasures buried across the chapters. Definitely one of the best books i've read in a long time.

This is a good film and that Zwick's gamble paid off at the end brings me not little pleasure. The film, mainly shot in South Africa (we see some exquisite East Coast landscapes) and Mozambiquan towns, took a tremendous effort to make, both logistically and politically. Finally the Western audiences can see what represents daily life for many Africans.Far for being simply PC, this film shows that Hollywwod can sometimes be genuinely concerned about the root causes of human suffering. The wars that ravaged Sierra Leone and Liberia (spreading into other neighboring countries, such as Guinea) are depicted realistically. The violent scenes were, if anything, less graphic than reality on the ground. Child soldiers intoxicated by rap, drugs and alcohol and the 'grown-up' militaries led by the likes of Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and the RUF committed unspeakable brutalities. Can we, should we, judge them? The film depicts the indoctrination these children underwent and underscores the fact that the responsibility and real guilt for this suffering lies with the diamond traders that control the supply/demand chain. Traders, who by and large lead respectable lives in Antwerp, London, Tel Aviv and Cape Town.Without any doubt West African atrocities are/were fueled by demand created by artificial inflation of diamond's worth. With resepct to the suffering caused to Africans, the diamond merchants of today are not much better from slave traders of the recent past - a few centuries ago similar atrocities were fueled through slave trade flourishing in the same region ('the Gold Coast', 'the Slave Coast').The main character played by DiCaprio is a Rhodesian, an ex member of the 32nd SA battalion and the Rhodesian army. Rhodesian mercenary and counter-insurgency units were (and still are) legend material - famous around the world as perhaps some of the best trackers and fighters in history. These people also showed that fighting together is the easiest ticket to multiracial integration - as we an see today in Iraq.DiCaprio was, for me, a great surprise. Impeccable acting; the accent, the nervous ticks and mannerisms, the naturalness all suggest he's grown a formidable presence. The acting suggested a combination of intelligence and fierceness, an announcement of a new force on the acting scene. Connelly was consistently good. Hounsou's performance was mixed - from generic and not credible to heroic and deeply moving. Finally, the music was excellent.All in all, an excellent film that exposes what has been going on in West Africa in the past decade or two. It is perhaps too much to hope that suckers living in 'civilized' countries will stop imbuing simple rocks with magical and romantic aura, enriching cynical diamond merchants and perpetuating the vicious cycle. Do you think you really show love for your woman by allowing De Beer to make a few hundred/thousands of dollars off of your paycheck (and naivete)? It is time to stop this anachronistic custom that is but a simulacrum for true love and commitment, or wealth. This movie is a step in the right direction.

In this review I will skip the obvious stuff and focus on a frequently overlooked aspect of Gurdjieffian 'work' that forms the essence of this book. G. can be seen as the inventor of the model of the modern guru-disciple relationship. A model which totally privileges the guru side of the equation. Because the disciple is supposed to "receive everything" from the guru his duty is to unquestioningly obey, follow and financially support, the master. There is a systematic attack on attachment to non-cult friends and family, who are all "asleep". There can be no discussion, or bargain - the disciple either is "in" or, if he shows streaks of independence or dissatisfaction, "out". It's total control. This poisons the disciple's mind.G. used people for his own ends and needs. He collected around himself a coterie of Russians and English, from middle and upper middle classes, typically (although not always) well-off and preferably rich - businesspeople, aristocrats, artists, publishers, politicos etc. Only, G. changed the rules of the game: these supremely class- conscious people were now compelled to worship the 'magician from the Caucasus' and to unquestioningly obey every whim he might have had. The brilliant trick invented by Mr. G (and later replicated by Rajneesh and pretty much all contemporary 'spiritual masters') was to tell devotees that their travails were not to satisfy him personally but an abstract ideal he called "The Work". In Ouspensky's case this meant suspending writing his own books and devoting his psychical and material resources to Mr. G. Until he woke up 20 years later and left the master - even then, G kept tweaking the man. When O. moved to Istanbul, G. followed, took O.'s students and persuaded O. to work on his ballet. Eventually, O. was fed up and moved to London. G. followed him there as well, took his students and was given a mansion. And so on. Lorin Roche describes Ouspensky's situation best: "In your outer life you are living one way - you are a citizen of the United States or France or England or Slovakia - and in your inner life, as part of your meditation, you are a low-caste serf in an 15th Century Hindu ashram, struggling to get a little bit of attention from the Master, and begging for permission to exist. "I am not saying that Mr G.s information wasn't valuable. After all, Ouspensky who was interested in numbers, planets, physics got exactly what he was looking for: numbers, planets, hydrogens, octaves etc. G was happy to explain anything as long as it left the power equation on his side.G: "...if you haven't any slaves, you are a slave of someone. ... The well-being of man is that everyone be his slaves."Q: "But shouldn't one give up using egotistically one's power over others?"G: "Today you do it unconsciously; try to do it consciously. Then it will be good, both for them and for you. There is no other justice."When power began to shift, G. adapted & compromised. Superficially, a similar approach could be seen as having had been adopted later by Rajneesh, the Rolls Royce Guru. While Rajneesh was basically a spiritual criminal, however, as far as i can tell the situation with Gurdjieff was more complicated and difficult to understand.O. was a follower until the very end. He takes extreme care not to compromise overtly or divulge personal details. This book is a reflection of a fascinating relationship, documenting how G. took hold of smart people and made them relinquish what they had in a misguided belief this helped their inner progress. They would have progressed just as much had they not kowtowed and compromised their integrity and had they questioned the brutality of everyday interactions with the man. But then, we give what we have so easily because we don't treasure it. Information (even spiritual information) is not knowledge. A guru's real intention is to obfuscate this fact. Real knowledge and real learning, can only occur through an open heart, through freedom, and through love. By fostering psychic independence. Gurdjieff failed here almost totally. His own problem was that he had no peers. Elevated and revered, he forgot he was (only ever so) human himself. And that was a mistake.For me, the questions it opened have to do with the "price to pay" for spiritual 'teachings' (amal misazad yak zaati shirin)?

This book stands out from its genre by its originality, by its positive portrayal of Catholic Church and by the unyieldingly pessimistic view of human nature. I probably liked it most for the humor and tongue in cheek Part I, could not really relate to apocalyptic Parts II and III where i felt the author becoming more stiff and moralizing.Despite the strained analogies that pervade the book, the knowledge-loving preservationist Church portrayed in the book is nothing like its medieval predecessor which actively persecuted new metaphysical or scientific developments, burning a few unfortunates in the process. Another part that surprised me was the almost complete absence of women - which, for Miller, do not seem to exist except as breeders of men. Any church that does not accept women into 'priesthood' is not going to make it in the XXIst century.Still, the book was enjoyable for its uniqueness, weirdness and perhaps most of all, the unmistakable scent of the American Southwest. Which I love.

In this thought-provoking book, Hillman provides another twist to the question of the soul and 'soul-making'. Pace Jung, soul has been defined as a "functional complex of the psyche that mediates between the psyche (which is mainly unconscious) and the ego". As such, the soul is our ticket to a full and satisfying life; in case that the link between the soul and ego is broken, the untethered Ego becomes synonymous with madness, destruction and despair. A soul-less Ego enters the soul's domain, the Underworld, without protection, falling at the mercy of fantasies and projections emanating from symbolic 'complexes' that define its landscape.Hillman's Underworld cannot be comprehended,bribed or usefully navigated by the ego. The archetypal forces and energies that define its contours are non-human, brutal and non-caring. If not pacified by attention and respect they will rape, Hades-like, the conscious mind (Persephone). Underworld is where Death lives and, paradoxically, it is also the source of life.The upper world ruled by Zeus and the lower chthonios ruled by Hades are the same - only perspectives differ. One brother sees the universe from above, the other from below. Hence, Zeus cannot be understood in the absence of the Hades perspective. In other words, experience cannot be explained through the analytical mind alone while ignoring the messiness of the Underworld. To do so, would be to actually express the death drive, the quintessential Hades (underworld) energy.Greeks and 'primitive' peoples understood that all creativity, all life force, life power - comes from the underworld. The Ego can experience this paradox as the fight between good and evil, a metaphor that just happens to be championed by our primitive monotheistic religions. In reality, however, the Underworld harbors neither good nor evil. There is only energy, organized into more or less autonomous psychic complexes that resonate with the energy brought in by its guests. Yet we don't want to visit the Underworld. We recoil from it. This allows the archetypal material to choose its own manifestation. In a straightforward way, its embrace can be experienced as dreams; Hillman tells us it also hides as hunches, inspirations, anxieties or bouts of depression.Hillman shows here that Freud, who created the realm of the inner space for the Western man and thereby discovered the Underworld, is not dead. The book suggests that much of conventional therapy, instead of familiarizing people with this domain, tries to conquer it through 'figuring it out'. The self insists on pathologizing itself by deciding something is wrong and needs fixing. What if, asks Hillman, there is nothing to fix? What if the sadness, fracturing of the self, hostility etc are normal manifestations of soul's growth process? You can't make yourself less sad in an organic manner (unless you take Prozac). However, you can co-opt the psychic energy of sadness which wells from the volcano that represents your/our access to the Underworld. As a result, your connection with your soul grows, you become larger and more You, and you get to know another universe where everything is possible. One is condemned to face precisely what one has wanted to avoid. No shrink can help here, there can only be tentative advice from travelers who have the battle scars to prove the journey. Tibetans know this, as do many tribal peoples.This is not an easy book to read. It's dense, obtuse and self-satisfied. Hillman and never stops to consider that maybe the peculiar psychic underworld described in DATU represents his psyche alone. Nonetheless, i have a lot of respect for this book. Greek myths and Egyptian religion should be required reading for every aspiring psychology/psychotherapy/psychiatry etc student; come to think of it, for every Western college graduate.

Combining genres is not easy and often results in corny, pretentious and contrived "works of art". One might think that mixing Western and Sci-Fi topics would be a recipe for disaster yet this well done film manages to pull it off. Excellent acting, scenography, cinematography; exquisitely detailed representations of aliens and their technology; innovative mix of characters that include cattle ranchers, townspeople, Chiricahua Apaches, alien saviours & gold-digging "demons" from other planets. A touch of the spiritual with a peyote-like ceremony; the film also teaches an effective method for stopping one's mind.Attention to detail is everywhere. From the cursory flick of the camera to Indian scalps on frontiersman's saddle at the beginning of the film, to the intricate design of the "arm-laser gun" and the space ship. The amazing Western landscapes (Escalante?) had my undivided attention. I liked how the director played with genre cliches, always using a light touch and a sense of humor. This is the XXIst century's answer to the often dark and surreal 'comedies of the absurd'; to Bunuel, Burroughs and Monthy Python - and I have to say I much prefer CAAs to The Exterminating Angel.In other words, this is a well done, produced and directed film that works from a weak script . For us, it brought great visuals and an entertaining couple of hours. Can't go wrong on this one.

The Mekeo are a fairly prosperous tribe in southeastern PNG, making a living by growing and selling sweet potatoes, taro, coconuts and betel nuts in Port Moresby. Stephen describes a stratified hierarchical society based on patrilinear clans in which every person's role is precisely defined both in terms of societal relations/obligations and their cosmological counterparts. The tribe is divided into peace, war and 'sorcery' (ugauga) factions each of which has senior and junior family lines, and one's relative position within the clan comes with the power of ritual charms allocated to that family line.The book shows the implications that such distribution of power has on the Mekeo. Ordinary reality is a reflection of events that occur in the non-ordinary reality inhabited by mythical heroes, ancestor spirits and various kinds of 'bush spirits' with which humans interact through their souls (or 'dream selves', lalaugas). One can arrange the unfolding of events through ritual implementation of symbolic representations of the mythical domain, thus ensuring success in hunting, love, health but just as often, illness and demise of the victim. This is no laughing mater for the Mekeo. Everyone is your potential adversary (including, and especially) your immediate family. Within the family and the tribe every - even the most insignificant -perceived transgression is punished, often times disproportionately. As a result, Mekeos develop inscrutable, wary yet (on the surface) relaxed attitudes and an extraordinary awareness of communicative minutiae. "Men of sorrow" such as Stephen's mentor A'aisaga are sorcerers charged with enforcing of the social norm by bespelling/manipulating the dream selves of their fellow villagers.What comes across fairly well is the remarkable courage and persistence of the author who participated in and learnt what seem to be some of the most dangerous ritual practices of the Mekeo, many of which contradict Western concepts of 'fairness' or 'common sense'. Like many anthropologists who 'apprenticed' to local magicians around the world, Stephen faces the challenge of explaining the apparent effectiveness of 'dreamwork' practices on people living in the 'real' world. She valiantly tries Jungian, hypnosis, cross-cultural etc paradigms but does not succeed in building an appropriate explanatory framework. Still, what the book shows is the immense power that tribal memory & symbolic representations that is exerted when they intersect with a living culture. Power that affects tribal members as well as those who did not grow within the culture itself. By uprooting ourselves we Westerners have lost - for better - or worse - contact with powers that reside in our mythos; animals, spirits and ancestors. Instead, many chose to submit to a warlike Middle Eastern deity which insists on proselytizing, domination and exploitation. Although Stephen shows that tribal life in the tropics is not (what M. Mead might have us believe) a bed of wine and roses but rather a daily struggle for survival on the spiritual plane, somehow - there I discerned much satisfaction there, and much aliveness. By forsaking our mythos we have forsaken that life. This book provides food for thought with implications that go way beyond anthropology as we know it today. Top notch fieldwork, highly recommended.

This is a simple movie, not made to be dissected, competed with or watched for the plot or action. rather, the film provides a taste of SoCal that is partly mythical and partly disappearing and for that alone i loved it.there's something wholesome about the film, left me feeling good which does not happen too often for me, and almost never with the large commercial blockbusters. to see Willie Nelson's smile, that alone was worth waiting for. mcConnaughey does a good job, as does Harrelson & most of the crew.in other words, this is not about surfing. it is about friendship and about knowing what you love.

The amount and quality of information in this book is staggering. There is something to be said for a tradition that goes back for many centuries, a tradition that has combined a sophisticated 'energetic technology' with an established ecclesiastic hierarchy that weeds out charlatans and pretenders. Although Native Americans, Lapps etc have similar 'technologies' you will be lucky to get 5% of the info described here from an NDN - first, he doesn't want to talk about the stuff ('too sacred') and second, he doesn;t have a language for it. Tibetans, on the other hand, have developed a vocabulary (much of it sourcing from Abhidarmic texts) that clearly, precisely and unambiguously delineates various types of mental/physiological/psychical etc states and can be used to navigate tricky transpersonal domains as well as to develop greater, more effective and satisfying life. In other words, the Tibetans have developed a solid, unified, empirically tested container with appropriate safeguards.The book starts by describing the properties of the 5 elements and their relationship to the human psyche. TWR goes on to describe breathing and visualization exercises designed to embody particular elements and their relationship to energetic channels & chakras. Analysis of different types of elemental spirits. Very helpful depictions of working with natural forces, tantric deities, protectors and dzogchen practices. These blend together, seamlessly. Techniques on taking in, holding and releasing tension. Methods to release every negative experience into a more spacious, embodied experience. These techniques are not in the service of self; getting rid of personal suffering is simply an expedient way towards serving all beings, to helping with the awakening of the Universe.It is rare to find a book on shamanism that is so concise, informative and selfless. Recommended.

This is a spectacular film that inhabits a category of its own. Far from mirroring a simplistic antagonism between the classes, La Ceremonie allows us to observe workings of the human mind with almost mathematical precision. I don;t see the film as a thriller at all - it is worlds apart from the genre designed to evoke cheap spine-shiverings from high school students. Chabrol's film is a dissection, a study, a palimpsest of the human condition. As such, it does not entertain - it illumines.This film is about rejection of entrapment in the Brave New World of niceness, comfort and security. Chabrol turns the conventional tenets of bourgeois life: decency, cultivation, education, goodness, social concerns around by suggesting that 'niceness' and innocence' can be (to use a technical term) a simulacrum that disguises the all too human compulsion to wield power. While in themselves perhaps something to be desired, middle class values isolate those who aren't raised with them. By their very nature, thjis isolation is condescending, an attempt for the petty bourgeois to feel as an aristocrat in his own mind. Condescension, of course, is the highest form of rejection that we as primates are conditioned to acutely feel. The push created by social distance is what Sophie and Jeanne feel, resent and react to.There is a pattern to an unexamined life that, when captured by coincidence, creates an aura of inevitability. Chabrol shows better than any shrink could how woundedness, child abuse and social isolation can lead towards a cathartic, climactic release through an act of violence. This release is human, random yet at the same time almost predictable. As inevitably tragic as are the 'random' acts of violence routinely happening on American streets.I'd call La Ceremonie a coda to existentialism. Chabrol, like his predecessors, rejects rationalism, linearity and simplistic consumerist voyeurism characteristic of most modern commercial film production and goes straight into the gut of humaneness. Existentialism emphasizes action, freedom, and decision as fundamental and in this context, the film's end was a ceremonial release. No repentance, no cowering, no kowtowing to the rich and powerful: the two women prefer to go straight to hell with the mad courage that reminds us of their predecessor Don Giovanni. This, for them, is an act of sanity, a total rejection of the hypocritical and unjust word inhabited by the priest, churchwomen, the family; a mad world that denies dignity and power to those without money and education.The Huppert acting is magnificent, absolutely masterful. And Bisset is, as always, luminous.

Do you want a recipe for how to become an instant writer of 'spiritual' lore? Go To Peru, adopt a couple of Peruvian orphans, superficially read a couple of tomes on Andean geography and 'shamanism', perhaps even take a tour or two.. and: lo! 'The Secrets of the Ancient Incas" is born. I give Langevin three stars for pure chutzpah. Needless to say, this book is not about 'ancient Incas', it is all about Langevin (what a great guy he is...etc..heh heh) and perhaps you will find buried in between the all too mundane travelogue a few New Age practices that fit quite well within the Magical Blend but have little to do with the Inka.At least he is sincere and does not make things up, which is an achievement in itself if one considers the feeding frenzy that plagues popular Andean shamanism these days. If you want more substance, I'd go for Williams, Villoldo, or even Wilcox

Here is a great example of Tibetan music emerging from the isolated plateaus and valleys where it has been passed on from generation to generation for more than a thousand years. Choying studied with the Lama Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, one of the greatest teachers of luminous awareness meditation and this album leads us into the space in which we too can touch the existential awareness, purity and beauty that the Tibetans have preserved for us for all these centuries.The simple harmonies of Tibetan sacred music have been designed to create energetic response patterns in the singer and the listener ... to link the visible with the invisible. The particular chants in Cho represent and mediate the surrendering of the body to "hungry ghosts" - an ancient Bonpo (shamanic) practice in which the practitioner sees through the illusion of a solid reality by recognizing the insubstantial nature of all things.You cannot miss with this music that celebrates awareness and truth.

Hmmm...This is an excellently acted, directed and produced film. Based on a creepy self-loathing script replete with scato-physical and scato-sexual fantasies. It would seem that the writer is exorcising his geeky ghosts at the expense of the viewing (and paying) public. The pseudo-anarchism seems like a cry for help. Can one appreciate great acting based on a bombastic self-indulgent script? There, right there, is the reviewer's dilemma.

The information and guidance about how to live with the awareness of the Earth is often not easily accessible to us Westerners, or is set within New Age paradigms that for most are difficult to stomach. This is where Harmer's book comes in... it is based on the truth of one man's personal experience with an old indigenous medicine person. Yet, Harmer is no Castaneda and his teacher is no imaginary Yaqui sorcerer ... rather, we get so see life among present day Okanogan Salish in the American Northwest; Harmer learns from them as the Indians themselves have been learning from the time immemorial: little by little, in bits and pieces. He is taught by his Salish mentors to observe nature, his dreams, and to integrate his lifetime experiences and traumas so as to increase his ability to perceive and act in the world. I know of few books where the simplicity, pragmatism, reverence for nature and power that native peoples possess and wield has been demonstrated so effectively.There is much anthropology on Northwestern Indians, the Salish, Kwakiutl, the Tlingit.... a lot of academic crap, and very little about their real-time knowledge, wisdom and power. This book closes the gap & I recommed it highly, especially if you want to learn about native American dreaming practices, exorcism, spirits and, above all, about how to develop and practice perception skills and awareness.Above all, the book lays out quite starkly the choice each of us has to make for ourselves...do we serve the planet or its destroyers. As Clayton Woods, Tom's Salish mentor asks: "Which side you on"?

If you ever go to Gambia, this is the book to get, together of course with the ubiquitous Lonely Planet. Hudson, a young adventurer, spent 14 months in a Mandingko village, observing and commenting on the daily life. Amazingly, he was allowed to join one of the women's societies... so he followed them around, participated in their dances, field work and intrigues and documented this stuff in OGD. Hudson shows that African women are, although destined to a life of hard work, circumcission & mostly unhappy arranged marriages, far from helpless creatures. They are economically independent, they are free to choose their lovers, they sing and they dance:"It was in the early hours of the morning before the dancing began in earnest, the figures of the women glowing as though golden in the light of the hurricane-lamp, as they came running towards the drummers, spinning around only at the last moment to dance. This was what they liked more than anything elese - the extremity of this total bodily exertion, this fervent, almost ecstatic unleashment of energy, in which every muscle, every last atom of their energy would be used. It was as though the rhythms of the drums..[...]... were touching something actually inside the women themselves, to which their frenetic shaking was an involuntary, though wholly pleasurable response. They called it dia - sweetness.""Hear the sound of these drums!Our own drums!Here the sound of these drums!Our grandmothers' drums!"Hudson shows that African life can be strange beyond our imagining. The pragmatic and relaxed attitudes towards the body and sexual activity; the separatedness of women and men, who get together pretty much just for sex; the ancient initiation formulas and rites, the pragmatic interpretation of the Muslim religion mixed with animism and, above all, the aliveness of these people get through in this book really well. These Mandingko use their bodies for pleasure in a way which makes Westerners look like hollow emaciated specters lost in our greedy little calculating minds. There is much fun in African lives and much sadness - sadness that we have forgotten about.We need to learn from Africans about how to inhabit our bodies and about how to live in the present moment and this book gives us first hand information on these topics. Highly recommended.

Joan Halifax is a charismatic roshi, chaplainness and ex-shamaness. The woman has been through a lot with Grof, Huichols, Maezumi, Varela and all kinds of indigenous and non-indigenous celebrities. If contemporary Buddhism has globetrotting grey eminences, Halifax and Richard Gere would be primi inter pares.My unease with this book has to do with the need to record and publish our personal lives for the world to see. It's a form of narcissism and it takes, imo, away from the magic of a life. at the very least, one capitulates to the myth-of-oneself as well as to the publisher. For the zennie.... it kind of defeats the purpose. To study the self, one needs to forget the self... :)i don't think this book adds to Joan's aura, formidable as it is. It detracts from it.

This book summarizes some of the basic concepts in the Northern Coastal tradition, including the pre-conquest cosmology, classification of natural and supernatural beings and archetypes and types of energy used for healing with the mesa (the "medicine bundle" of Peruvian shamans). The particular mesa used by Matt, and described in remarkable detail in the book is called Pachakuti ("Transformation/Transition")... and is widely used for healing purposes. the book talks about different ways of organizing the objects in it, empowering it etc. The book is written concisely, clearly and with a pragmatic bent... there is a textbook quality to it.It will appeal to those with deeper interest in indigenous practices from Peru. Certainly the information in PS is not widely available. The book, if you can get it, will get you in touch with a vibrant, if reclusive, tradition.

This is an unusual book in which hard core tracking tips are blended with instructions on cultivation of the inner silence. As opposed to other stories about tracking which border the domain of fiction (e.g., "The Way of the Scout"), Brown gives us in this Field Guide practical advice on reading animal tracks, constructing shelters etc. The tips on "Nature Observation" in this field guide are unsurpassed by any other tracking book I know. TB provides us with priceless descriptions of what happens the moment we enter the forest - that is, how the alarm signal spreads from the birds to mammals and how long it takes for it to subside. The forest he is talking about is a living entity, where everything is connected and where one can plug into the circuits of the information flow by learning to listen to the sounds, by studying the terrain and the wind and by knowing how to camouflage and mask one's smell. The book provides useful info on various types of walking/stalking in the woods. Finally, there is deep reverence for nature something which occurs when one has learnt to be silent amidst the whispering trees (no mean trick for the Westerner who tends to function through the head). Tom Brown has learnt the inner silence tricks from his Apache teacher ("the Grandfather") and trackers might find this book useful for learning more about Native American attitudes toward nature. A similar approach to nature is encountered in some of Paul Rezendes' books (which i also recommend). In short, this book will be useful to those who are interested in approaching nature on its own terms. It will inspire the beginners in tracking and complement knowledge of hard core SAR UTS trackers (:)

This is an excellent and light-hearted parody of the 80ies and 00ies pop phenomena. What strikes me in the filmis an understatedness as well as a certain joie de vivre that works only when the actors enjoy themselves.Haley Bennet did a spectacular job as Cora, acting with intelligence, precision and verve. She was hitting all the right notes and delivered, with Grant, some of the best moments in the film. It is not that Madonna, Xtina and Nina Hagen are spiritual fakes - on the contrary, it is the earnestness of their belief that they can live and mediate spirituality via entertainment that Haley mirrors in an acting tour de force.The songs were catchy as well - kudos to the songwriter. Can't get the damn Pop!Goes My Heart out of my mind :)All in all, a well crafted, professionally delivered, light-hearted and positive comedy.

This project is an exhilarating meditation on the nature of reality. Linklater, in my opinion, succeeds remarkably well in mimicking the experience of lucid dreaming with his use of photomontage, cartoon overlays and jerky camera movements. The dialogues and characters in the movie possess a ghost-like quality that lured my unsuspecting mind into the murmurs of incandescent unpredictability, so typical of dreaming....and the creative process.What underlies all the philosophising, the analysing and reviewing in Waking Life is passion for experience of life mixed with unease and wonder that one has in the face of the unknown. There are no subterfuges, no tricks, no gimmics, no questions even - only the wide open eyes of a young man watching, observing and experiencing. This is an awesome movie and I intend to watch it many more times.

This is a collection of short epigram-like quips from one of the enfants terribles of modern psychiatry. Szasz has noticed, like Laing before him and Foucault later on, that language has a terrifying power to define, isolate, constrain and control. The politics of power includes the definition of what is sane -ie, of who is allowed to participate in the society and who is to be denied this participation. This power has conferred upon the psychiatric profession a tremendous burden of responsibility, which, according to S., is often not shouldered with integrity. Prescribing Ritalin to millions of active children, criminalizing some drugs (but not others peddled by powerful and rich lobbies), institutionalizing people who in indigenous societies would be allowed to participate in the community... is often ethically suspect and philosophically questionable. To Szasz, forcing patients into treatment against their will is nothing short of mental rape. Most psychiatrists get away with peddling drugs to children simply because this is the only game in town, and they are determined to keep it this way. "When the psychiatrist approves of a person's actions, he judges that person to have acted with 'free choice'; when he dissaproves, he judges him to have acted without 'free choice'."The language used to define sanity becomes a tool through which psychiatry both insulates itself and assumes control. Psychiatrists use, according to Szasz, 'ready-made phrases' whose function is to 'anesthetize the brain'. Defining people as ,insane', 'deperssed' etc is a semantic hammer that can destroy the subject's dignity and respectability as effectively as cracking his/her skull. This dehumanized language ceases to see a schizophrenic patient as a human being, denies him/her the ability for self-control and self-determination, defining them in a way that makes them invisible to themselves. While Szasz keeps pointing out contradictions and taken-for-granted attitudes in his field, he does not have any real answers.I find interesting Szasz's observation that addiction (smoking, drinking, shooting heroin, etc) is "part of an internally significant dramatic production in which the 'patient-victim' is the star. So long as it is, the person will find it difficult or impossible to give up his habit; whereas once he has decided to close down this play and leave the stage, he will find the grip of the habit broken and will cure himself of 'addiction' with surprising ease."The history of psychiatry, as recorded by psychiatrists and medical historians, proceeds according to S. from a faulty basic premise: that the institutional psychiatrist helps and heals the involuntary (i.e., non-paying) patient. As a result, the patient loses control over his relationship with the expert, and over his basic dignity as a human being. One problem is that the institutional (or hired) psychiatrist is a bureaucratic employee, paid for his services by private/public organizations (HMOs, etc) and under pressure to overprescribe drugs and underproscribe individual therapy. Like the Inquisitor a few hundreds of years ago, the psychiatrist uses violence against the 'madman' in order to restrain him/her from possible and feared violence against the social order. While in former Soviet Union psychiatry was a tool to be used for confining political opponents to mental hospitals, Szasz's work opens up a new set of questions, that is, does Western 'science' similarly criminalize people who are different simply because they cannot participate in the marketplace. As a result, the bureaucrat resorts to socio-chemical engineering."The 'depressive' is low on himself; the psychiatrist makes him high through drugs. The 'manic' is high on himself; the psychiatrist makes him low through drugs." (p. 75).Szasz shows himself to be cantankerous, acidic, cynical and courageous. There are a number of instances in which I disagree with him. However, he still provides, after all these years, fresh air and thought-provoking ideas about language, power and sanity. These will not go away soon.

Some books can touch frozen archetypal currents within us and entice them into flowing again. This is one such book. Ende has adapted the Hero's Journey to fit modern sensibilities, to rekindle enchantment with a world in which imagination, dreams, fantasies and wishes are temporarily saved from invisibility of the real. I found the book to be profound and touching. It is an entrance into Ende's world of magic, mystery, beauty and endless surprise... a world as strange and alluring as it is familiar.

Campbell provides a fresh, common sense perspective on Tibetan Buddhism, informed by her practice and her association with Kalu Rinpoche, a venerated teacher in the Kagyu tradition. Vajrayana represents a remarkable and seamless integration of Mahayana, Hinduist tantra and proto-Mongolian shamanic tradition. Since it became a state religion under Tibetan kings, the shamanic element receded into the background. As far as Campbell is concerned, this resulted in severing the connection with the feminine, earthly energy - Tibet became a theocracy ruled by men for men. Spiritual authority was handed through the "tulku" system, which consisted of taking young boys (never girls) from their mothers and putting them into monasteries under strict regimen of doctrinal studies and meditation.On the psychological level, such a system would have a tendency for creating men who are disconnected from women while having the very normal biological impulse to have sex. Unfortunately, motherless monks and tulkus would have no idea how to deal with women except from a position of cultural-spiritual authority and, Campbell would say, domination. Tulkus have been raised into cognitive dissonance: women are polluting, they are an obstacle to practice, at best women can serve others and at worst they are a nuisance - yet women are also transformed into dakinis, female aspects of being that men must associate with in order to reach enlightenment. Part of this paradox has been sublimated through tantric practices imported from India and China that used imagined spiritual consorts. Another part, however, resulted in the tradition of real people-consorts and mistresses kept by lamas. They would rationalize this as a recapitulation of the famous union between Padmasambhava and his consort Yeshe Tsogyal that represents the bedrock of Vajrayana despite the fact that female lamas like Yeshe Tsogyal have not been seen in Tibet for hundreds of years due to suppression of female assertiveness and power by the tulku system. Subcontracting a religion to men alone is usually a bad, very bad, idea as we can clearly see in the West.The Kalachakra tantra (practiced by Kalu), for example, has frightening apocalyptic aspects that reflect the male psyche under duress including religious warfare and extreme violence against women - something that few Western bliss bunnies eager to get initiated into the practice comprehend. Nor was the pre-China Tibet a bed of roses. Critics such as Michael Parenti would say that Tibetan hierarchy had been no less venal, autocratic, power-hungry and brutal towards its serfs (peasants and herders) than the medieval Catholic Church. Serfs were taxed upon getting married, taxed for the birth of each child and for every death in the family. They were taxed for planting a tree in their yard and for keeping animals. They were taxed for religious festivals and for public dancing and drumming, for being sent to prison and upon being released. Those who could not find work were taxed for being unemployed, and if they traveled to another village in search of work, they paid a passage tax. Monasteries lent peasants at 50% interest. If the peasant could not pay, they were made into slaves. All this was an integral part of "religion".The Tibetan religio-political setup has been dismantled in a brutal if not genocidal, manner by the Chinese in what is one of the great tragedies of the XXth century. However, reverberations of old chauvinist attitudes have trickled up to this day, as can be seen by the Naropa cult around Trungpa (another tulku) who cavorted intoxicated with his female devotees ("dakinis"), and Campbell's interaction with Kalu RInpoche. Kalu's father was a tulku and his sons have inherited the teacher mantle, which may be relevant with respect to the scandal caused by the intergenerational and intercultural psychological drama described by June Campbell. June, acting as Kalu's translator, was asked to become his "consort". When tantric sex is practiced between equals, energy flows in a circle to the great benefit of both partners. Practiced between unequals, the flow is in one direction, essentially a transfer of life force from the weaker less aware partner to the stronger one. Essentially a form of vampirism or to put it more mildly, a way to prolong the life of a highly respected teacher at the expense of a devotee who will no doubt accrue great merit and be rewarded in a future incarnation. While this was a clear case of cultural misunderstanding, it is just as clear that Kalu's entourage was aware that the situation was not kosher as they swore Campbell to secrecy (family secrets again; a trademark of any cult).If this happened within the Tibetan community, it would have been part of a cultural setup that is taken for granted. The Western psyche, however, does not work that way. It is much more individualized, and subsumed with shame, anger as well as an innate belief in inviolate human integrity. It was not until years later that the sheer anger at the disrespect she was shown and revulsion forced Campbell to speak out. This book thus that paints a historical, cultural, psychological, sexual and personal portrait of a fascinating religion that looks behind the lines of its ordinary glow. A religion which represents a pinnacle in the human ability to establish a relationship between the sacred and the profane and nudge us towards conscious evolution. As such, however, Vajrayana is also ever so human, depending on its messengers represented in this book by both Kalu Rinpoche and June Campbell. The two teach us about equally important aspects of incarnation. Blind devotion and uncritical acceptance of hierarchy is, in this context, anti-spiritual and an aspect of ignorance. In some visualizations practiced by Campbell, the Lama (spiritual teacher) was made into an authoritative diety in the mind of his students. How could you refuse to have sex with your own deity, especially in the context of increased prestige within the cult? Will Westerners groveling at the feet of ever-so-human holy men eventually learn this lesson, which is a precondition for becoming self-aware?

This book is about pre-WWII Alexandria with its promenades, palms swinging in the wind, colonial palaces and dark, smelly, narrow passages of the old kasbah; it is about delicate relationship between the Alexandrian expat community (writers, diplomats, soldiers, hangers on, ne'er do wells) and the native Egyptians, Copts and Jews. Like in today's New York, these people love and hate and yearn in blatant disregard of unwritten rules of conduct that separate the rulers and the ruled in the post-colonial world. i simply love the delicateness with which Durrell writes about passion, about the unfolding of the senses, creative inspiration and about the soul. i love the humour that seeps through the pages and the uncanny way he captures the personalities of his protagonists. The people in this tetralogy have become my friends - Scobie, Clea, Nessim, Melissa, Darley, Pombal, Pursewarden ... have taught me about living (and about dying). In many ways, the tetralogy is very unpretentious - it is about ordinary lives of Alexandrians just before WWII. But how very extraordinary is the ordinary. How beautiful is the gradual unfolding of Darley's own character from the clutches of passion and lust and into the embrace of love. These books are about giving and taking, about the mundane and the sacred, sweet and sour of life. And they are about nostalgia and yearning which take refuge in an open heart. I recommend them highly.

Catherine Blake is a hapless participant in this remarkable book that digs into the underground circles of 18th century European spirituality. While Catherine would doubtless object to using her conjugal life as a rhetorical foil for Schuchard's ideas, I learnt a lot in this compendium of difficult-to-find information about sexual-spiritual practices amongst her husband's contemporaries. This book lays out the geography of organizations and mystics (often accomplished men of the world who practiced sexual-spiritual techniques in utter secrecy) some of which exert their influence into this day and age.In Blake's time the privileged few had access to esoteric information from the East and the West. Despite sporadic accusations of antinomian sex, for example, Talmudic and Zoharic practices by Cabbalistic Jews had an especially prominent influence with their instructions about `earthly and heavenly copulation'. Schuchard: "By meditating on the male and female potencies concealed in the vessels of Hebrew letters, by visualizing these letters in the forms of human bodies, by regulating the inhalation and exhalation of breath, and by achieving an erection without progress to ejaculation, the Kabbalist could achieve an orgasmic trance state that elevated him to the world of spirits and angels." According to the author, Blake was a disciple of a well-known rabbi, had access to information about sexual aspects of Freemasonry (especially the Scottish Rite), those of Moravian followers of Jan Hus (who believed that "Christ can make the most villainous act to be a virtue and the most exalted moral virtue to be vice"), Swedenborgians and yogic/tantric practices from Tibet, China and India. However, while cabbalists put mystical union in the service of procreation, Swedenborg, Blake and of course Indian/Tibetan tantra used it as a way to serve mystical consciousness.What strikes me most about Blake is his emphasis on embodiment: "we are all coexistent with God; members of the Divine Body". The erotic `mysterium' occurs "while in the Body. This is to be understood as unusual in our time, but common in ancient." Here Blake probably leans on Swedenborg who elevated the sense of touch into the highest spiritual gift in his voluminous treatises on The Brain, The Senses, and The Organs of Generation. This detailed, original and (for Europe) groundbreaking work included graphic analyses of bodily glands and nervous function. Swedenborg obsesses with the `cremaster' muscle that controls male ejaculation and describes "genital respiration" techniques leading to "an inward and sensible gladness shed over the whole body". In other words, male's general health is sustained by sexual vigor, and vice versa because sex represents "a pleasing expansion of all things of the mind". A man must keep his thoughts "on high and hold them in the air, as it were, so that they do not descend and press on to that which makes that love." Very Mantak Chia :) Perhaps not too surprisingly, these men had rather enlightened ideas about women. Because women are "designed by creation to constitute the felicity of Men" it is tragic that they are so repressed and poorly educated. The only way to achieve a sacred trance is with an empowered equal in a (hopefully, but not necessarily) conjugal sexual act. Here is where Mrs. Blake's unhappiness comes from.In summary, in Blake's time many adventurers explored links and similarities between cabbalistic, Tibetan, Nordic-Gaelic, and Christian beliefs. The London society was linked to Swedenborgian & Masonic lodges in Avignon, Paris, Berlin and Stockholm. These rites were in turn exported to India and China by initiated captains sailing for the Swedish East India Company, which completed the circle. Blake's own ideas were transmitted to Yeats and through him & Golden Dawn to us. Fascinating stuff.

That Native Americans are often treated as second class citizens is often due to the fact that they do not possess adequate educational, political and financial resources. Deloria and Wildcat analyze, in this eminently practical and thoughtful book, the causes and conditions that led to this state of affairs. They identify the European dialectic method as one of the key factors that alienate Native Americans. The problem, as they see it, is far from benign - dialectics as practiced in the academia not only champions a simplistic cause-and-effect reasoning which is far removed from the Indian tendency to view the world in a holistic, pan-theistic manner... it also produces isolated, self-absorbed individuals separated from their own bodies and their own society. Such separation is incomprehensible to the Indians, who view themselves primarily as members of a community and for whom individual achievements are largely meaningless without the context of the community support.Another significant difference between the Native and Western educational approaches, say VD and DW, are that while the former stress personal growth from the early childhood on, the latter concentrate on factual learning during which the harmonious development of the personality takes the second seat to professional development. This produces what to the Indian seem deviant and psychopathic characters completely out of touch with their community and nature, focused as they are on making money and selfish personal advancement.DeLoria and Wildcat offer several solutions which may aid native americans in navigating the perilous universe of disconnectedness that they face in the world-at-large while keeping to their values and worldviews. Even more, they identify how these values may actually aid them in becoming succesful without compromising themselves.Recommended.

This film marks the pinnacle of Woody's career, introducing the main themes later rehearsed to death in subsequent projects. A self-conscious neurotic quippy self-flagellating Jewish comedian meets a juicy self-conscious WASP, wooing her, rejecting her and after being rejected himself longing for a life that could have been. There is always an aura of sadness about Allen's films - a sadness of masculinity longed for and never realized, of self-contempt burning in someone who knows he can't ever escape the intellectual mindtrap that epitomizes the 'New Yorker' crowd. While Allen appears to despise the greed, snobbery and pretentiousness of this crowd, he always seems paralyzed and unable to find his way out of the mousetrap.Annie Hall is a genuinely funny and profound film. Alvyn knows the New Yorker crowd lacks something that would fulfill his longing. He knows that 'Annie' represents his one chance to escape the straightjacket of empty intellectual poseurism. The self-revelatory autobiographical element are bittersweet as the viewer becomes all too aware that Alvyn fails the challenge of his life. the very character trait that makes him funny makes him incapable of being able to hold, endure and accept Annie for who she is . The film is, for me, a lesson showing how not to be a man. A demonstration of the consequences of not being able to love fully, of being unable to disappear into surrender.Both Keaton and Allen do a fantastic acting job basically playing themselves. While Allen never surpasses the quirkines, the bittersweet lightness of the Annie Hall's Alvyn character, Keaton's best moments come in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" made in the same year.

This book cynically jumps on the bandwagon of Castaneda's successes, but as opposed to C., the book does not succeed either as fiction or as a resource for someone who wants to learn more about shamanism. Rather, Andrews gives us a latter day version of Blavatsky's theosophy laced with an eclectic mix of Lakota, Aztec and pseudo-feminist self-improvement jabberwocky. Rather shameless, actually. I struggled to develop some sympathy for the supposedly autobiographic character, but it is so bland and so full of internal inconsistencies that i gave up. The most shocking thing about this book is the ruthlesness with which this mass consumption product is marketed towards women who seek spiritual guidance. To end on a more positive note, the books in the autobiographic genre that I would recommend include those by Timothy Knab, Martin Prechtel and Manuel Cordova-Rios. To women interested in starting their own shamanic practice I'd recommend Sandra Ingerman's Soul Retrieval.

As many other Herzog's films, the WOT looks deceptively content less, with a narrative that is descriptive in the simplest possible way, but never explanatory - nor (and that is fascinating in itself) comprehending of what it sees. The narrator knows that he is nothing but a mendicant observer yet somewhere deep inside one can sense his awareness of the privilege inherent in witnessing scenes of great power, profoundness, depth as well as simplicity.This is not a "movie" as much as a random yet exquisitely arranged collection of scintillating time points.It takes a bit of a mental switch to notice the colors, the sparse beauty of images - of the lake, the mountain, the people, the fluttering butter lamps, the birds about to be released into freedom, the inner beauty of the man imprisoned for 37 years by Chinee occupators for having shouted "Free Tibet"....To me, WOT shows the awe-inspiring sincerity of Tibetan Buddhist beliefs and the beauty of the people who espouse them. Every single face, no matter how weather-beaten, old, ragged - was filled with an immense beauty that reflects a deep connection to earth and spirit. With real life, life that I could feel for hours after I switched off the TV set. In other words, this is work made by a master film-maker.Caveat: the camera often feels irritatingly intrusive as it forces itself into faces of simple nomads and pilgrims. This Teutonic lack of tact often made me cringe. Illiterate Tibetan peasants seemed more civilized and refined than the inquisitive Teutons disturbing their meditations, prostrations or lunches with their in-your-face camera technique.just to watch those faces, however, made me happy.

Armstrong describes the history of the three major monotheistic religions. Her main point is that each of them can be characterized by the tension between the mystical and the traditional, "fundamentalist" streams; that is, between those who have personally experienced God's love and those who use "God" to maintain their power vis a vis the Other (when the Other is represented by women or adherents to other religions). The book shows see how the religion, when ossified into dogma becomes an excuse for suppression of internal dissent and for armed conquest by power hungry fanatics blinded by Yahweh and his incarnations.The power element in religious fundamentalism of all 3 faiths can be traced to one single event - the moment when Yahweh a tribal deity originally in charge of warfare, emancipated himself into The God. This resulted in banishment and persecution of the old religions which were based on appreciation of nature and its life-cycles and subjugation of the feminine. At that moment, the Mother archetype (I.e., Astarte) had been banished by the "Jealous God" and we get male chauvinist weapon whiping fanatics bent upon power struggle and victimization of the powerless. Very sad.What I like most about Armstrong's book is how elegantly she ties all three religions together - she shows that the three faiths did not rvolve independently. In fact, the opposite is the case - here has been extensive cross-pollination in which ancient Greeks, Hebrews and Moslems influenced each other in theological and intellectual sense . In perhaps my favorite chapter A. describes how Mohammed took many key elements of the religion he was developing from the Medina Jews. Also fascinating was to read how the Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophers (such as Plotinus) influenced the islamic doctrine; and how ibn Rushd managed to unite aristotelian ideas with islamic ones. Subsequently, Muslim theologians had a tremendous influence on Christian and Jewish theologians such as Aquinas and Maimonides (which we conveniently seem to forget these days) and provided an important intellectual basis for the flowering of Renaissance.It must be said that this book is not for everyone. To enjoy it one probably must have had an exposure to what these days is called "humanism". But if you have a keen interest in that murky intersection between religion, politics, philosophy and, (yes), mysticism, you will find an inexhaustible treasure of images, facts and ideas. Highly recommended.

I lasted for about 1/2 hour and gave up despite the good acting - this was arguably the best act i've seen Cruise deliver, ever (hmmm...food for thought). The sentimentality, the pathos, the Weltschmerz, the decadent male-on-male vibe are so kitchy, cliche-y and predictable that i was about to gag. Seriously - what about Rice makes people so impressed? She may be a bit more mature than the cute and vapid Stephanie Meyers but still - aren't we talking Much Ado about Nothing here? Isn't vamp gothery simply an inability to relate and communicate with fellow members of the species, an art form designed for teenagers in sexual overdrive without the erotic know-how?Yeah, i guess this is it - a whiff of danger (ooooh - lookit, blood), a simulacrum of eros, a dollop of sentimentality and socially acceptable queerdom and we get the 21st century hipster swooning like a 19th century matron enthralled by Chopin (oooh - Frederic, encore une fois...). Is the vampire a simple metaphor for the unlived disconnected adolescent pining for real flesh and blood? Or is it the dream product of a frustrated woman yearning for her dark knight who will, finally, take her soul? Yes it's a sad culture we live in, disconnected from feelings & from vitality ... instead of facing ourselves we tune into cheap spine shiverings crafted by unfulfilled matrons dreaming up their incubi (incubuses?)."The anemone and flower that weepshave grown in the garden plainwhere Melancholy sleepsbetween Amor and Disdain..."Confucius say: "Support bacteria - may be only culture some people have.

This CD includes a collection of Sioux and Navajo spiritual songs. Both the singing style and musical accompaniment of these songs significantly depart from the rigid convention of peyote singing - the singing is gentle, almost gospel like and there is no water drum. The songs are simply among the most poignant and beautiful I have ever heard - filled with devotion to the Creator and strength which comes from true humility. Listening to them is listening to profound teachings about the spiritual and the earthly and about our longing for beauty and truth. I highly recommend this CD.

Having read a couple of previous books by TR I am very disappointed by ARA. There is no story here and while Robbins tries to mask his lack of inspiration by inserting little divertiments such as catholic ninja monks, chariot-driving fleas and the corpse of Jesus Christ, the tricks do not really work; to me they simply appear crude and uninspired. The plot is disorganized, the writing is sloppy and the ideas tired. The only redeeming feature is the Amanda character, which continues the long line of spunky desirable females in Rs oeuvre.

What do I like about Aimee? Her songs are real, unique and authentic. You can see her through the songs and through her voice - direct, clear, honest and punchy - and that brings me real pleasure. Not to mention that Mann has a wonderful feeling for the melodic line and a unique way of writing lyrics. When I listen to her music I see an interesting, independent, sparky, intelligent, irrepressible woman - in other words, attractive and sexy. Perhaps i am getting old.

This is one of the best resources available to readers interested in how Native Americans approach the Native American Church as well as to anyone who wants to get a glimpse into how Indians relate to one another, to spirituality and to white people. The NAC promotes family ties and acting with responsibility and integrity, which is why its members are invariably amongst the most hardworking and successful members of the tribe. This brilliant little book shows the pragmatism, common sense and clear-headedness with which Native peoples approach 'spirituality' and there are many poignant paragraphs about the relationship to the sacred and the thin line between the sacred and the mundane.A rare find, this book. It reads easily, is superbly edited and provides an uncensored overview of NA sttitude towards life. Highly recommended.

Both Carville and Begala are clever puppies and they see at least part of the writing on the wall. However,both guys have been part of the problem. Who supported and promoted the wonkishness of Gore and the pompousness of Kerry? Who has been prancing and 'ragin' for all those years instead of waking up and doing the hard work of creating new metaphors for the American people? This book at least provides a few hints that they have comprehended that quest for political power is not about reasoning or facts. Or about being right.True, the Democratic party is in disarray - but not because the Dems are doing something wrong. It is because the donkey is facing a beast never seen so clearly in this country (although it did make a temporary appearance in ol' Germany). What the book does not say explicitly is that you cannot fight unreason with reason. Lies with statistics. Populism with tact.The GOP has adopted a strategy that has been a perennial winner ever since we descended from them trees. The Rove strategy is designed to trigger the collective subconscious of the nation and to pander to the worst instincts that we have as humans. These people are master manipulators and propagandists...and, in addition, they are expressing a genuine, ruthless, and disciplined will to power. They know how to fan the fear for survival; the pack instinct; the narcissism, selfishness, and mask all this with a dose of religiosity that addresses people's need to belong. Now that these have all been coopted by the Republicans - what do YOU do? How do you deal with all powerful metaphors such as "The War on Terror"? "No Child Left Behind"? "Death Tax" that are designed to take hostage of the collective unconscious of a whole nation? How do you address: "'Im a uniter, not a divider." What do you do when Rove goes for your jugular?Although they talk a good talk, the Democrats do not have that will to power. Nor do they have a way of addressing people's fears. This book shows this as clearly as any.

This is a remarkable book that combines gnostic scholarship with spiritual insight and deep understanding of Jungs ideas. The book starts with a disquisition on the esoteric origins of Christianity and the role of a Jewish sect (the Essenes) living around Qumran. Essenes (some scholars believe they may represent the Sadducees) were repelled by phariseic/Rabbinic Judaism and practiced a mystical religion that might have inspired the first Christians (John the Baptist, was possibly associated with a similar group).I found the chapters that feature Hoeller's interpretations of apocryphal gospels to be, while an easy read, remarkably profound and providing much food for thought. Together with Elaine Pagels' books, Hoeller's work sheds light onto Christian ontology that shows the rich palette of religious beliefs practiced 1-3rd century AD. Most of thes ebeliefs were ruthlessly suppressed following the Council of Nicea when Christian 'dogma' assumed the lowest common denominator that allowed for easier state control. Suddenly, people like Augustine (himself a former Manichean) and Ireneaus were in charge. Books by 'heretic' and pagan mystics were burned and teachers of experiential, mystical Christianity (Gnosis) persecuted and often killed through commands by orthodox bishops. From championing freedom, Christianity became obsessed with control of people's bodies and minds. Gospels discovered at Nag Hammadi provide us with a priceless view of another (in a sense less adulterated, more vibrant and real) Christianity. Quite possibly, they allow us a closer look to what the historical Christ really taught. This includes a different understanding of Judas' betrayal and quite possibly, a different view of God.To many gnostics, YHWH represented a 'demiurge' - an angry, jealous, impetuous, aggressive deity that demands to be worshipped. Examined from an analytic POV, the demiurge clearly shows major signs of unconsciousness. A principal deficit is the absence of feminine energy (Sophia) which has retreated and/or been disavowed, something that was manifested by Israelite genocide(s) against peaceful Isis/Astarte worshiping cultures, but also in the aggressive religiosity of the contemporary Bible belt. According to Nag Hammadi gospels, Mary Magdalene was one of Jesus' most elevated disciples and he considered the union of male and female energies a prerequisite for 'entering Father's kingdom'. To me, the gospels sometimes sound more Buddhist than Nicean. Nor is there obsession with worldly success that we see in latter day televangelists and Saints; after all, Jesus expelled merchants and money changers from the temple. Reading gnostic gospels, then, brings us closer to the real teachings of the real Jesus of Nazareth and out of demiurge's clutch.Hoeller's Jungian interpretations of gnostic material are good while his depictions of gnostic myths are masterful and inspired me deeply. Since this book was first published more material has been discovered and translated but the basic picture, as far as I can tell, remains the same. You can't go wrong with this accessible yet profound introduction into gnostic Christianity.

One of Watson's basic ideas is that "evil" is something that introduces chaos into the ordered structure of the universe. Anything that decreases diversity of life (say, species extinction) is inherently evil. Where I'd agree with Watson is that the planet-destroying, profit-seeking timber industry, corporations and evangelical Republicans fit the category of evilness rather well. However, this opens the question of the potential dichotomy between conscious and unconscious evil.While the book is worth picking up for its interesting naturalistic trivia, on the whole it does not deliver. If you're looking for an analysis of psychopathology, you will be dissapointed. W.s notions of evil do not encompass the possibility of "conscious" intention to harm life. The naturalist Watson cannot plunge into the depths of the psychopathic personality and into the origin of selfishness, separation, spite and fear.... which are wrecking the life on this planet. There is no discussion of the relativeness of evil in some way, 'evil' is a matter of perspective. Is it evil to fumigate the termites out of your attic?Chaos is not so bad as Watson makes it. Another wy for it is spontaneity :).In some ways, evil, could be seen as unconscious energy seeking to manifest itself without regard to the universal principles that sustain life.

Goldsworthy captures the true not-knowing in which the process of creation is a true collaboration between the landscape, artist's senses, and his sensitivity (or, for the lack of a better word, his soul). The ecstasy of the sunrise lighting up stone icicles is matched by the bittersweet destruction of compositions by rivers, wind, gravity and time. rhythm permeates everything Andy does - the rhythm of change, the eternal clockwork of the tides, 'fire' created by the root's contact with the earth and seen in the blackened stem of the Scottish fern... Rhythm, and its intimate and integral partner, the chaotic decomposition into primordial elements. Destruction is an integral part of a Goldsworthy composition.In this era when the relationship between the teacher & student, master & disciple, celebrity & awestruck peons is formalized and tends to be permeated by the deeply human notion of status and gain, Goldsworthy embodies its equally human antipode by living his life at the interface between solid & liquid, deeply profound & whimsical, village & countryside, life and death. The lack of pretentiousness in this film is, to a jaded cayote, breathtaking, humbling and ever so inspiring. i could watch and watch his band-aided fingers stick an icicle on another, a stone on a rock, a stick onto its counterpart.just as Andy mediates his narrative by working with the elements, the filmmaker and composer contribute a sublime counterpoint with a sensitivity that is in every sense an equivalent to that of the primary creator. The filming has its own cadence and the music follows it, sometimes engulfing it, other times retreating. Just like a river. Or perhaps a tide. What we get, then, is an amplified artwork where everybody involved has practiced a letting go, a respect for the flow of color, of energy, of time and space.I've seen this film several times over the years. I love it.

There is not a dull moment in this film. Delpy has a blast playing with cliches and truisms about the French - and Americans. She pokes at the racism, promiscuity, xenophobia, intellectual pretensions and vulgarity that come to light as soon as one scratches the surface of the French psyche.On the other hand, she also shows the hearty, food-loving, stylish and alive core of the French where the family sticks together for better and worse and where life is appreciated for its own sake.An argument for the French is not a time to reach for the gun, or call the psychiatrist - it is an opportunity to display how you feel, and get the emotional charge out of your system. A healthy way of being in the world, which sometimes scares the crap out of the typical American ...yet what do you prefer: the true person or fake politeness?The film plays with national and class stereotypes in a tight, fast-paced, brilliantly scripted story which nevertheless finds plenty of space to touch genuine and deep human emotions and predicaments. Delpy explores the nature of connection tethered to the inexorable fact the we know all too well: that "love" and commitment involves daily negotiation, adaptation and acceptance of teh partner for who they are. A relationship where personal quirks and idiosyncrasies are not only indulged but in some weird way celebrated. Where one never knows when or why the break-up occurs, sometimes hanging in on the precipice of chance.In other words, Delpy's Paris, and her French and Americans are real people and the story is a story about reality, even though, paradoxically, the film itself is made to poke fun at cliches. I laughed most the time, and at other times I was sad. What more can one want from a film?

I rejoice in the supreme spontaneous presence that is effortless.I request the turning of the wheel of the ultimate dharma that is ineffable.Chagdud Padma Gargyi WangkhyugEchoing the previous reviewer, this book provides standard (well-written) instructions on meditation together with an introduction into Bardo Thodol that intersects with popular accounts by Kuebler-Ross and others. Sogyal also instructs the reader on getting access to the 'clear light' (rigpa). This is remarkable given that he may have not been initiated into Dzogchen.If one reads the disturbing "Behind the Thangkas" expose (available on the web) it would appear that Sogyal is a yet another Tibetan who has created a cult rife with sexual exploitation and spiritual pretense. "Sogyal was enthralled by Trungpa's sexual conquests," says a witness, "he told me outright that he wanted what Trungpa had and aimed to achieve a rock star lifestyle." And he got one, through complicit contributions from his consiglieres Gaffney and Harvey.Sogyal talks about the "sacred relationship between the master and the disciple" as crucial for the "living transmission of the truth, from mind to mind, from heart to heart", invoking his "beloved master Dudjom Rinpoche." He recounts returning from his master on a train to Paris and finding himself in tears, "saying to myself over and over again: 'Had it not been for you, how could I possibly have understood?'" This is all very curious, since Dudjom Rinpoche forbid him to teach ('recommending' he go to India for more instruction) then cut him off from the French sangha.So yet again we have a dilemma, with a reasonably well-written book and a rascally pretender who seems to have exploited spiritual seekers (mainly women) for decades. Asian 'gurus' like Sogyal have all too often grafted the 'sacred master-disciple' relationship onto unsuspecting Westerners, using it to extract favors from naive devotees. In the absence of ethical-moral frameworks that provide accountability in the Asian context this can only lead to heartbreak and trauma, and Sogyal is responsible for a fair share of both. When asked to practice Tibetan Guru Yoga (or its Indian, Japanese versions), one should think long and hard before plunging into the unknown. Visualizing Padmasambhava and one of the Buddhas is probably the way to go. And one should always remember that, when it comes to exotic and homegrown teachers we are talking about dudes with normal and sometimes excessive worldly desires... when it comes to money/donations and women, the large majority of these guys are not above pulling tricks.Finding a good teacher is good karma indeed!!!!May we all attain enlightenment in the primordial vast expanse where phenomena fall away. May we never be separated from the full and complete awareness.

There is a geographic area that might be considered the navel point between Europe, Asia and Africa. This territory, extending via Samarkand towards China, Altai and Tibet and via Constantinople to Athos, Armenia and Coptic Egypt is permeated with the heritage from ancient Greece, sufism and Persia. While in many ways the region has remained an enigma with respect to esoteric teachings, it is widely believed to have given birth to many accomplished magicians and dream masters. Among these definitely belongs Georgios Ivanovich Gurdjieff.Gurdjieff considered AAE his magnum opus. He used the book to transmit his teachings in a code that can be as vexing as it is funny and instructive, and that is virtually unbreakable for all but the purest afficionado. The basic container holding the main Tale is an early version of Star Trek: highly evolved beings (described as having tails, hoofs and horns) use a spaceship (powered by a perpetuum mobile superdrive "made of amber with platinum hoops and interior panels of the walls made of anthracite, copper and ivory") to hop from planet to planet as emissaries of assorted Archangels. While traversing the hyperspace, they communicate via "etherograms" (!), use their teleportation machines, reflect on the meaning on existence and entertain each other through tales - in this case, mainly stories about the planet Earth and her deluded human inhabitants.Beelzebub's Tales transmit the essence of G's lifelong realizations and teachings.The ambitiousness of this work is mind-boggling, as is the cleverness of the code which is mostly beyond the reach of a two-brained cayote. The work stands on its own, not only with respect to esoteric teachings of the early 20th century (when Gurdjieff had virtually no serious competition - theosophy is kindergarten stuff compared to Beelzebub's Tales) but even today, when unfortunately many of us lack the time, energy and commitment for real spiritual study and practice. The wisdom and depth found therein are remarkable and illuminating - if you are able to claw yourself through text like this:"For the further clarification of the phenomena taking place in the (planetary) atmospheres and concerning the 'Omnipresent-Active-Element' in general, you must know and remember this also, that during periods when, owing to the sacred process 'Aieioiua', 'Djartklom' proceeds in the Okidanokh, then there is temporarily released from it the proportion of the pure - that is, absolutely unblended - Etherokrilno which unfailingly enters into all cosmic formations and there serves, as it were, for connecting all the active elements of these formations; and afterwards when its three fundamental parts reblend then the said proportion of Etherokrilno is re-established. "This is how it goes for... oh, 1348 pages, not for the faint of heart. There is much fascination with science, natural phenomena, nature of religion, Buddhism, psychology, (Kundalini) yoga and human constitution that is Ur-Trekkie ... also you'll find wicked discussions about Bolshevism and French hygiene, both of which Mr. G found highly unimpressive :)There are uniquely personal & cultural aspects to the Work as well. Anyone with Armenian or Georgian friends will immediately recognize the peculiar style of humor G. puts into the mouth of the fabled Sufi Mullah Nassruddin who pops in and out of discussions on the nature of energy, universe and God. What struck me in particular was Mr. G's inexorable sense of hierarchy that is deeply embedded in the Tales and a certain sense of loneliness, perhaps even sadness, associated with it. Some may call his uncompromising attitude impeccable; others - generous; still others (me included) - a bit melancholy and disconnected. Are the Tales profound? Yes. Can they help people wake up? Perhaps. The book, as brilliant and far-seeing as it is, is an expression of an uncompromising man, an elitist who had no time for regular folks like you and me. It requires much thought, intellectual grit and persistence (in G's words: "the conscious and intentional fulfilling of Being-Partkdolg-duty") to be able to extract pearls from it.

This book gives us another glimpse into the Hornby universe - which is a messy, often anguished but also an entertaining and friendly place. His characters tend to remind me of marionettes, manipulated by invisible hands which deny them fulfillment of sentimental fantasies that drive most fiction and, in all honesty, drive most of us. There is no unconditional love, there is no transcendental hope, there is no deus ex machina jumping out of a wooden contrapture to save hapless Kate, David and their kids. Instead, there is Life - the deliciousness of flailing in it and getting buoyed by it; the exquisiteness of not giving up yet accepting what is. In this way, Hornby reminds us of the essential nature of the human condition, its messiness and also the joy inherent in the messiness, when we allow it to permeate us deep into the bones. It must be said that H. is a master of this genre, he is funny and he is ever so contemporary; although this book has perhaps slightly less momentum than his previous two, i still liked it and i am sure many others will too.

This is an opportunistic film, based on a weak script, bad casting and mediocre directing. The director counts on (extraordinary) visual effects to bail him out almost as if blinding the viewer by cool tricks would mask the many internal inconsistencies within the plot. I was unable to relate to any of the actors, which was intensely dissatisfying - the movie lacked, for the lack of a better word, humaneness. The characters were unidimensional, without an inner life as well as unconvincing (especially the scientists). When the best act is provided by the robot well then the director has a problem. I count this one as a "miss".

In this book Alberto Villoldo recapitulates neoshamanist techniques used by CG Jung and popularized by M. Harner, Sandra Ingerman and their gang at the 'Foundation for Shamanic Studies' as the best (and harmless) way to introduce Westerners to some form on nonlinear, non-thinking experience. Basically, 'soul retrieval' is a form of active imagination or 'awake dreaming' that leads the 'dreamer' into her subconscious mind. Villoldo's book is no better and no worse than other products on the (increasingly saturated) market - basic neoshamanist imagery techniques spiced with (successful) episodes from Villoldo's own counseling practice.While I like Villoldo's early books based on his own apprentice stories from Peru, his conversion into neoshamanism and syncretism seem a bit unexpected. Certainly V. never explains why he finds 'journeying' methods more effective than (or complementary to) age old Andean practices, nor does he provide a rationale for blending the two at the end of the book (when he speaks about the pururuna, sacharuna, uiwayruna etc). It seems funny that a man who seems to call himself a 'laika' (sorcerer; something an Andean would never do)and claims to have been taught by some of the best Peruvian native shamans, now teaches Westerners active imagination developed by Jung and Harner... a method that can be called shamanism only with a significant stretch of imagination. To me it seems the man simply had to write another book.Or that he finds it difficult to stay out of the limelight. Writing books is an addictive business.

Macdonald chose an unorthodox approach in superimposing the narrative by the two climbers (Joe and Simon) to the segments of the climb filmed on the mountain itself (and in the Alps) by two superb climbers and by two excellent actors.The movie is sparse, with the words themselves a backdrop to the silence known by every climber, a silence that is filled by total focus on action and self preservation. The cinematography on the mountain was spectacular.yet this film is not only about climbing. It is a testimony to human endurance, will-to-live and relationship with the elements as well as a testimony to friendship and decision-making when the going gets tough. What would you do if you were Simon? What would I do? The realness of this movie left me with something real.

This is one of the best books available to people interested in contemporary Native Americans. Mary Brave Bird's life story sheds light on traditions of her Lakota (Sioux) people from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations in South Dakota. She shows, in a very clear way, their tortured history with the missionaries, state bureaucracy, the courts, the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). We see to what extent the government has succeeded in destroying the old life and how small groups of the Sioux managed to preserve traditional ways and ceremonies.The book is written in a way which preserves the unique appreciation Indians have for unadulterated truth - a style which is simple, direct and in which personal experiences are recounted in a frank, almost brutally dispassionate manner. It reveals perfectly the heartless school system ran by abusive Catholic priests and nuns trying hard to deprive young people of their traditions (don't these people have better things to do?); we see the corrupt BIA system designed to prevent cultural and economic emancipation of the Native American "traditionals" (and steal federal money) and the pointless fear that the FBI has of organized Indian movements. Above all, we see the violence that the Sioux face daily from the white South Dakotans as well as the inter-Sioux violence caused by the hopelessness of the life on the rez. I was especially amazed to see that South Dakota has preserved, at the least up to early 1980ies, the barbaric attitudes towards the Native Americans (who are, after all, the original inhabitants, and who were cheated out of their own land by the very same whites who persecute them) which have by and large disappeared from the rest of the civilized world. This includes (unpunished) assaults by drunken lumberjacks and ranchers, systematic discrimination in the courtroom, forced sterilizations at the provincial hospitals (Mary's own sister Barbara was sterilized against her own will) and a system designed to eliminate all of the Indians' most courageous and spiritually conscious young people. A system that would make Uncle Mao proud, but which made this reader very sad, ashamed and angry. I suspect many of these things are still going on in our name. I mean, why can't these people leave the Indians in peace, allow them to practice their religion and (is this too much to ask for?) respect their desire to be different?There are also many wonderful things in this book. The descriptions of relationships between Lakota men and women, between the young and the old, between the full and half-bloods and between the host and the guest are simply priceless. Likewise Brave Bird's descriptions of peyote meetings, Sundances and Ghostdance revivals. Mary has very strong opinions about the Sioux male machismo and the reluctance exhibited by many Sioux men to providing a comfortable and loving home for their families yet she understands that this is the inevitable consequence of the systematic destruction of the old ways of tribal life. After having read the book I can see the challenges facing the indomitable Sioux nation, the challenge of preserving and honoring the old ways while educating a new elite familiar with the white system (without considering them to be sellouts); only when they gain political representation and economic self-sufficiency will Native Americans be able to keep at bay the greedy timber, mining and ranching industries whose interest is to keep the tribes divided and the people dispirited and lost in alcohol. The Lakota of today need to find a way to create loving conditions for their children. And they need to speak their truth, as often as they can, just as Mary Brave Bird has done in this amazing book.

A previous reviewer writes about Grof: "His insights into the deeper nature of the personality are simply without equal, transcending psycho-analysis, psychiatric theory, and the history of religions. "This quote reflects, in a nutshell, a view prevalent among the New Age 'transpersonal' crowd and psychedelic advocates. I doubt it reflects Grof's own beliefs which tended to morph, shift and readjust. While this book has clear historical value, the applicability or usefulness of Grof's idiosyncratic concepts is debatable. Working with the fascinating material that was emerging from LSD seances in Prague and at Johns Hopkins, Grof had to develop his ideas on the fly, swimming in order not to sink.While a lot of people (rightfully) resent the limbo in which entheogenic research finds itself today, theysometimes find it difficult to accept that this is to a considerable extent a result of unethical behavior of the early pioneers who flounted conventional research standards. If hallucinogenic flights of fancy brought you personal and cosmic insights this doesn't mean they are going to be equally helpful to someone dealing with a psychotic breakdown.The question that comes to mind is whether these treatments were designed to help people or to satisfy Grof's scientific curiosities and test his ideas about the 'development of consicousness'. I find the apparent ease with which Grof administered LSD to shizophrenics, psychotics and other mentally ill patients, disconcerting. In my view it is short of irresponsible and bordering on unethical, as LSD most likely pushed many unfortunate clients further into dissociation. In any case, while the man made his name in psychedelic circles, conventional recognition eluded him. I am sure that, as always, conspiracy theorists will be happy to put the blame on the guvmint; a responsible reader of LSDP, however, can't help but wonder what ultimately happened to those LSD-exposed schizophrenics.Probably appropriately, these days Grof steers clear of controversial 'enthe0-therapy', appearing to be more interested in spiritual applications of hyperventilation. heh. While Grof was not amongst those chiefly responsible for the (undeserved) disrepute of entheogenic therapy, his undiscriminate use possibly contributed to the current state of affairs. Basically, Leary, Alpert and Grof mucked the field for everybody else, making it hard for bona fide researchers (such as UCLA's C. Grob) to secure reputation or federal funding. In any case, this is an interesting book that should be read by conventional and transpersonal shrinks, as well as the lay audience interested in putting into context their own extra-ordinary experiences. It is, however, one man's work, unsupported by peer review, unverified, highly speculative and with respect to psychiatry and psychotherapy, a dead end.

This amazing translation of two Sanskrit texts, Sat-chakra-nirupana ("Description of the Six Chakras") and Paduka-pancaka ("Fivefold footstool") was published around the end of WWI and is a prime example of the quality of European scholarship of the day. We don't learn much about Sir Woodroffe's personal practice however his textual understanding is nuanced and encyclopedic and is clearly based on extensive Western and Hindu sources.Both texts are detailed instructions on how to wake and guide the "serpent" from its sleep in the muladhara chakra. A lay reader will probably not get all they could, as the translated texts require a familiarity with terms such as mandala, bindu, vrrti, tattva etc. What is clearly conveyed however is that properly guided work leads to concrete results which are manifested by unambigous signs and evaluated through rigorous tests by credentialed teachers of Hindu Tantra. I would note that most Westerners may be more familiar with the Sikh version of Kundalini yoga which has its own (different but no less effective) textual infrastructure and practices (gongs!). Hindu Kundalini tantrikas were/are less secretive than the Sikhs so that, at least from the textual standpoint, we know more about the formal practice design. The foundation of these practices is often poetic and still resonates across the thousand(s) of years. Here are the words of Siva:"Welcome, o Beauty of the three worlds, welcome is Thy question. This knowledge (which I am about to disclose) is the secret of secrets, and I have not imparted it to anyone till now. Listen, then, with attention: " (p. 145).This, in a nutshell, is a classical work. It's worth reading for the text itself as for the commentary. For a more modern view, one might check the new translations of the Vijnana Bhairava Tantra. If one is interested in energy, and energy flow, this is a good book to have.

It is hard to imagine how transient and fleeting our civilization is. A hundred years has seen a shift from the Sand Creek massacre, where Christian priests were scalping Native American women and children to nominal civilization with universal suffrage. A thousand years ago Europe itself was in Dark Ages of barbarism and chaos. A modern day European has no connection to the Langobards, Alemani, Thracians and Visigoths. In contrast, the ancient Egyptians had known three thousand years of relative continuity and self-identity so that the people born in the New Kingdom could identify themselves with the texts, narratives and beliefs from the Middle and the Old. What made possible this amazing continuity? Who were these people and how did they look at life? Jan Assman, a Heidelberg University professor and one of the most eminent Egyptologists of our time has written a superb book on this topic, a book that addresses key elements of time, memory, free will and historical continuity that are ever so relevant today. I found it difficult to put down.According to Assman, life for the ancient Egyptian was a fellowship, a connectedness. This connectedness was maintained by harmony and justice (ma'at) a key organizing principle that can perhaps be regarded as the Egyptian version of Tao or perhaps the Navajo idea of `hozho'. Harmony makes community possible and is synonymous with law, security and order set by a centralized state. The failure to realize this interconnection of life results in loneliness and death. Maat is ensured by the State: all common, shared things, depend on the state: language, knowledge, and memory.The Egyptian state was founded on an unshakable faith in the immortality of the soul and the prospect of future judgment. Interestingly, these ideas are also central to Christianity, but not the Old Testament (a tribal document devoid of the concept of life after death or notions such as kindness, or lovingness).The Egyptians identified covetousness, greed, as the source of all evil. Keeping greed in check required constant effort. The great countergod of the E. pantheon, Seth is:"He who is content with separation and hates fraternization;he who only supports himself on his [own] heart among the gods"very modern, this guy Seth. Would feel very comfortable in Wal-Mart or NYSE. Or the blood diamond merchants of Antwerp. There is great sophistication in using language and thinking in Middle Kingdom, when we observe a universal political education, indoctrination and propaganda. Religion itself required a great mnemonic effort on the part of the pharaoh and the priests; including ritual practices that we might call magic, as thoughts and dreams were very real to E. - so real, that evil in the sphere of language and imagination is given greater prominence than bad deeds; figurines found in pots made of burnt clay had inscribed curses against:"All bad words, all bad speech, all bad imprecation,all bad thoughts, all bad plottingall bad battle, all bad plans, all bad things,all bad dreams, all bad sleep."Assmann emphasizes that human equality is a fundamental principle of Egyptian society. Unlike the Vedic Indians with their castes, and the Greeks with their free citizens and slaves, the Egyptians did not see existing differences between rich and poor, strong and weak, as part of the creation... "I have made each man the same as his neighbor", says Amon Ra, the sun god. The king is advised to `appoint his officials solely on the criterion of ability'. Inequality was seen as a product of covetousness, the "greed of the heart". Hardheartedness, selfishness and megalomania were universally condemned. These differences are traced back to the "heart" -to human free will. In fact, the idea of a "heart-guided individual"is central the Middle Kingdom.Assman is ever so careful to evade a (self-imposed) 'hermeneutical trap', avoiding any temptation to actually 'feel' what Egyptians themselves might have felt or experienced. Conequently, while the book has many fascinating pages, it lacks a certain depth that could only come from the author's 'tuning in' into phenomenology of subjects he has devoted his life to studying.Anyway, I liked the chapters on the two Transitional Periods, and the descriptions of the Hyksos (who, according to Assman were related to the Jews), the Nubians and even references from the Greeks; what I missed was more information of the Assyrian and Persian conquest and more information about the Egyptian religion. Here are "Instructions for King Merikare":"Beware of unjust punishment.Kill not, for that cannot be useful to you.Punish with beatings and prison:By this the land will be well founded. [...]Kill no one whose spiritual strength is known to youWith whom you have sung scripturesWho has read in the book of trial and can walk freely in the sacred space.For the soul returns to the place it knows.No magic can hold it backIt reaches him who gives it water.

The Tsangpo river cuts the eastern Himalayas to join Brahmaputra in the jungles of Assam. Intrepid British explorers have chartered most of its course during the glorious days of the Raj - leaving unexplored ~10 mile stretch of an inaccessible 'Tsangpo gorge'. Because the altitude difference between Tibet and India cannot be accounted for by the known flow of Tsangpo, the Brits hypothesized that this stretch of the river contains a large waterfall (or a series of them). This book describes several expeditions undertaken 1990-2000 by Baker and his colleague Hamid Sardar to solve this geogrpahical enigma.Both adventurers speak Tibetan and have a working knowledge of Tibetan tantra, both completed silent meditation retreats in isolated caves and both practiced with 'tantric consorts', Tibetan & Indian women placed on special diets (consisting of rose leaves and gold) trained to help men achieve a 'union of male and female principles in order to recognize the ultimate Emptiness of all phenomena." While Baker tittilates the reader here, he never delivers real information.Baler obtained a number of esoteric texts from lamas familiar with the Tsangpo territory - the texts detailed magical places throughout the gorge, incantation 'keys' necessary to 'open' those places, the nature of 'deities' residing in them and the value of their help to realization of the fact that 'nothing inherently exists on its own'. Heh. These texts, as well as subsequent Baker's narrative, reveal that the valley has ALWAYS been known to and lived in by Tibetans and local Monpa & Lopa tribes; it was never unknown, never had to be discovered and the rivalries driving American and Chinese expeditions to chart the river portrayed in the book seem pointless and even slightly comical. As well as poignant: expeditions (including Baker's own) were quite content leaving ailing and weak members behind to fend for themselves. Personally, I found the obsession with 'discovering' and 'exploring' a bit disconcerting. Why do we have to document, photograph, chart etc. every nook and cranny on this planet? Why can't we let it be? let local people be? What is the confusticated point?Baker insists on describing every single leech-infested forest and swamp on their way, every impassable boulder, pass, rivulet, stone or log which, with 500 pages, merge into a general picture of hardship, malaise, effort, hunger, leaking tents and, above all, sheer survival luck. There were so many cases where the 'pilgrims' appeared to wander aimlessly, in the dark or fog, having lost their native guides only to find them at the end of the day, against all odds huddling around a fire, that one is forced to contemplate the possibility of divine guidance.I would mention the fascinating account of 'poison cults' in local villages, and of small Tibetan monasteries and hermitages, scattered throughout the most inaccesible parts of the valley..., the gift of psychedelic mushrooms to a Tibetan hermit monk, and the touching relationship that developed between the Chinese liason officer, 'Mr. Gunn', and Occidental adventurers. Between the lines we can also read about havoc that local Monpas wreak upon local fauna (with mass-killing of rare animals such as the takin buffalo and tigers) and the much more serious Chinese depredation consisting of systematic mechanized exploitation of Tibetan natural resources and destruction of the environment (not to mention cutural genocide). Perhaps understandably, Baker wants to preserve his future access to Tibet.The greatest weakness of the book is that we learn little about Baker's own practices and realizations. We learn a lot about leeches and orchids, but what was going on with the lama's daughter mentioned early in the book? what about the tantric consorts? what (if any) spiritual realizations and benefits did Baker and Sardar derive from obsessive backpacking along the Tsangpo...? We also don't learn who financed these expensive yearly expeditions. Why are there no photo's of the supposedly discovered waterfall? Why can't the waterfall be seen from sallites or googleEarth? The apparent fear of personal disclosure detracts from the value of the book.Nevertheless, the book is well written and I enjoyed reading it. One cannot escape the notion that Baker and Sardar exemplify some of the best traits of 'man' - courage, resourcefulnes, commitment to spiritual growth and to having a good time.

I admit that i started reading this book in a skeptical frame of mind, wary of a yet another psychiatrist who has jumped on the New Age wagon. I've changed my mind. The book is competent, informative and above all, brings us a glimpse of the author as a caring, inquisitive, unorthodox and perhaps even visionary, therapist. I liked him right away.Pharmacological and talk therapies have enriched the Big Pharma and countless analytical therapists over the past 50 years. This book book covers, rather comprehensively, the alternatives to this paradigm in which people are powerless with respect to the doctor and the shrink. The patient, says DSS, carries the seeds of his health inside his own body and mind. That makes him/her responsible for their well-being. True, the access is often not easy, obscured by old patterns yet help with techniques such Porges' cardiac coherence, EMDR, good nutrition (fish oil!), exercise, resetting the circadian clock with dawn simulation and, especially, good old-fashioned love & caring provides us with tools that every one of us can, and perhaps should, use for ourselves. Tools that are non-invasive, cheap and intrinsically self-empowering.What would I have liked to see in the book that wasn't there? I believe it would have been of interest to the reader to lay out the nefarious practices of the Pharma industry in their soulless search of profit. The Pharma budget for marketing exceeds their budget for R&D; - through prescription data mining they know exactly which doctor proscribes which drugs and thereby get an effective tool for a marketing offensive aimed at those doctors. Psychiatrists are often paid unbelievable amounts of money to prescribe certain (anxiolytic, antipsychotic etc) drugs regardless of their side effects or efficacy re: generics. The money for this ultimately comes form the taxpayers' pockets. So the first thing to do would be to prohibit, by law, the companies' prescription data mining.Sometimes, DSS may appear a bit too uncritical. Case studies champion the exceptional over the lawful and the average. Servan-Schreiber doesn't mention that an unbiased study conducted by Edzard Ernst (the world's first professor of complementary medicine), revealed that ~95% of alternative treatments (in fields ranging from acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy to reflexology, etc), yield results that are statistically indistinguishable from placebo. I, for the life of me, cannot understand the effectiveness of techniques such as EMDR. Why - and how - can it work? Synchrony across the corpus callosum? But this is a minor point. DSS succeeds in creating an effective balance between his own case studies (important because they provide a glimpse in his working style) and his clinical/basic science background. This book is a good, if highly personal and thus perhaps a bit skewed, entryway into the world of complementary psychotherapy that should be useful for therapists & clients alike.

The title is a bit of a misnomer, as this book tackles much more extensive subjects than simple 'taboos'. First, it has to be appreciated that when this book was written, anthropology was still reeling from pervasive structuralist dogmas which have 'polluted' the field for way too many years. While Douglas acknowledges the benefits of establishing a 'taxonomy of tribal religions' and is not averse to 'scrupulous cataloging of all ritual avoidances in a particular religion' (p. 167), she knows that any such an endeavor is necessarily arbitrary. She shoots Levi-Strauss straight out of the sky.At the outset, Douglas provides lucid and incisive critique of primitive 'anthropologists' a la Fraser, evolutionary anthropologists like Robertson Smith and (approvingly) Durkheim, whose emphasis on the social context paved the way for Douglas herself. This is not just a show - by putting Frazer in his place she opens up the questions of what is 'savage', 'primitive', 'magical' and 'ritualistic' - Frazer "disseminated a false assumption about the primitive view of the universe worked by mechanical symbols, and another false assumption that ethics are strange to primitive religion' (P. 28). In other words, MD lays out how preconceived notions about the superiority of the Western mind effectively preclude one from empiricism.The essential point is that purity/pollution concepts in any given society have to be viewed teleologically: they tell as something about the distribution of power within the society and the boundaries to the outside. The taboo/pollution laws keeps away the outsider. The point of (seemingly arbitrary and absurd) food rules of Israelites and Hindus is not to prevent people from eating unhealthy food (the 'medical hypothesis') but rather to separate those belonging to the tribe from those who don't. By following the dietary laws ('thou shalt avoid the camel, the hare and the rock badger!') one follows the Jewish law (halacha) or Islamic law (sharia) and in effect meditates on the oneness, purity and completeness of God. In other words, "Be ye Holy" means no more than "Be ye separate" (P.58).Thus, dietary law helps the Israelite cast off the yoke of an undifferentiated mind, dissolving an inexorable relationship to nature, wildlife and other cultures. Suddenly, man is alone in the universe in which he can only rely on his compatriots and the omnipotent warlike YHWH deity. By the virtue of such differentiation, man no longer considers himself a 'primitive' - an attitude we recognize today by the contempt an evangelical Xian has for 'savages' who view the universe as personal and intelligent, responsive to signs, symbols, gestures, gifts. No, the evangelical missionary wants to end this relationship to the living universe which cares about human-animal and human-cosmos relationships (P.87) and instead supplant it with a dead book. One might argue that adoption of a monotheistic religion requires a steep price to pay - no less than separation from a living breathing universe.The notions of purity/pollution are socially highly coercive yet are accepted as real because they bring about clarity and social order. one might see an internal contradiction here - by following dietary, sexual, social restrictions, man tries to appease forces of the universe and thereby garner a iota of freedom. Yet in some way they serve to both further entangle him into social slavery and to provide him with connection to fellow human and non-human beings and powers. Such a view might be valid, if one did not take into account the third dimension - that of impersonal power - that is achieved through ritual.The central theme of the book has to do with analysis of magic, witchcraft and sorcery. Douglas proposes that because man is a 'ritual animal', magic is inherent in one's social position. Powerful members of a society naturally wield magic in order to protect the tribe. On the other hand, sorcery and witchcraft are the means through which marginal members of the society vent their anger/resentment against the establishment. She also provides much interesting discussion on the role of magic/pollution in the relationship between the sexes, and even in the never-ceasing cacophony of inner voices that belong to different subpersonalities within one's self. It gets much more complicated because one socially sanctioned way to obtain more power is precisely to delve into the social cracks which are inaccessible during the normal daily life. Thus, in a ritualistic context, it may be necessary to temporarily go mad, indulge in incest, adultery, even kill. In this way, pollution acts as a sacrificial entrance into the holy.I found the book to be thought-provoking. Douglas' sweep is broad, comprehensive yet never without an awareness of the limitations inherent in anthropological analysis that comes from the outside and tries to generalize across different languages, tribes and religions. This is not dry sterile scholarship but rather synthesis by a well-meaning student of the human condition. I recommend it.

This is a shockingly inept movie with few redeeming features. Larry David in particular can't act - he can only be himself, for better or worse. The film (more of a TV show, actually) was shot on the cheap with the minimum effort. Weak, cheesy script. Superficial acting. The assumption seems to be that jokes that (might) work in a Brooklyn shtetl will universally apply. Perhaps not. There is no fun in the film, no depth, little actual humor - just a leering David. I liked the Barcelona film for its depth and awareness of the humanness of attraction, passion and suffering. But this? Awful!

This is a profound book that delves into the essence of what it means to be a human being. Everything is covered - from advice on efforts to face our own inner gremlins, letting them go, to advice on how to start relaxing and creating with one's consciousness."Creating is pure fascination" (p. 218)This is also a book that talks about dissolving structures, entering the chaos consciously, and formulating a will to happiness so strong, so unyielding, so determined that the intent becomes creating power itself. And that is where we truly start living. A great book.

This is not so much a book about yoga than an autobiographic journey through the wisdom acquired over decades of a deeply felt life. Scaravelli is a Swiss-Italian aristocrat who chose to live a life dedicated to learning, exploring and teaching. She was able to unlock many secrets by listening to the body, being attentive to breath and the dance that happens during merging of body and mind. And what happens during that dance is beauty.This book is a testament to Scaravelli's search for beauty. Paradoxically, it may come closer to the heart of yoga than the myriad ashtanga, Bikram etc studios focusing on athletic performance, on sculpting the bodies of young professionals who only can afford the 1 hour distraction from the survival game. Competitive yoga workouts are yet another, and typical, manifestation of the Western desire to grasp, achieve and possess. Athletics is a universe away from what yoga is about and what the true teachers (some of whom taught Vanda), taught over the (possibly) thousands of years.How do we get to live intensely even at the old age? By cultivating the power of concentration and the passion for our [art], says Vanda, which can modify the physical limitations by which the body is conditioned. If we know what we want, nothing is impossible.The book is valuable, authentic and inspiring. If you recognize spirit in yoga, you can;t go wrong with ATS.

This is a well-intentioned - if a bit naive and earnest - autobiographical narrative from a perspective of a Jew raised in NYC and CA. Pinkson's early experiences suggested to him that nature can restore his self confidence and makes him feel like a man. He believes that the answers can be found with indigenous peoples, such as the Lakota and the Huichols. Pinkson makes sure the reader gets his (Pinksons) respect for the old ways and his trust in the 'Great Mystery'... yet this is somehow obscured by his white man's humility dance .... all the while what seeps through pages of FOW is self-indulgence and perhaps a bit of self-promotion.Real humility does not advertise itself, Tom. A real student of shamanism does not "journey to shamanic power". Nor is he/she likely to, khm, write books about his experiences.

"My experiences with Sebastian and the energies of the Incan sacred sites form a new way of looking at the world. I am the same, but different. I cannot explain it."The above words summarize the book quite well. This is basically a travelogue, composed of three parts: the author's jungle experience drinking ayahuasca; afterwards he was exhorted by the ayahuascero (as are so many others) to go learn more in the highland Q'ero region (2) W.s chance meeting with a Q'ero 'shaman' named Sebastian, who initiated him into the tradition in the Incan capital Cuzco and (3) His visit to the Q'ero, culminating with the great annual festival at Mt. Colquepunku.The book is unpretentious and it is easy to see, how the Q'ero would take to the sincerity, earnestness, commitment and respect that Williams appears to show to people he meets. I liked that too. W. describes a number of key (and simple) Incan concepts and rituals such as reciprocity, life force, offerings and 'munay', the deep, abiding, impersonal love that comes straight from the heart. The Q'ero are masters of munay....."munay also signifies tranquility and beauty and suggests a pleasant experience characterized by harmony, symmetry, correctness, within and without. Beauty is the outer wrapping of munay, inside is kindness and love. It is inherent in nature. When munay becomes an integral part of one's character, it expresses itself spontaneously".i would recommend this book to anyone who plans to visit Peru and perhaps interact with indigenous people; it is packed with non self-conscious advice and personal experience of an enthusiast who comes for a visit several times a year. This book should especially be read by Westerners who insists on visiting the altiplano without adequate preparation and acclimation. Williams had a pretty rotten time there himself, but endured the misfortunes like a champ. So...Still, in many ways this is a rather superficial book. If you want to know about the Qero, Catherine Allen's The Hold Life Has can't be beat. It really should be THE reference for all even remotely interested in Peru.

Hafiz wrote these poems almost a thousand years ago. Yet, in this beautiful, delicate and passionate translation Ladinsky shows that the most important things in life - joy, beauty, open heartedness, realization of interconnectedness of life - are timeless and that Hafiz's open heart can inspire us as it has countless generations of Persians. Indeed, this book itself is a ladder which we can climb to meet the Friend.

The seeds of what was later to be "Western Civilization" were sown in the tumultous period spanning the decline and dissapearance of the Western portion of the Roman Empire and emergence of the Merovingian kingdom. The Goths, a Germanic people thought to originate from Scandinavia/Poland played a central role in European history, both as generals and troops in the imperial army, and as important players leading to eventual formation of two independent kingdoms, that of the Ostrogoths in Italy and Visigoths in southern France and Spain.Heather, a lecturer in medieval history at the University College of London, traces the political history of Gothic migrations with an emphasis on Roman-Gothic interactions for which there is a lot of written evidence from Roman historians Procopius, Boethius and Cassiodorus. Rome was a great attraction for the Goths, as a trading partner, military employer - and prey. H. is at his best describing intrigues between different ethnic factions and the rationale guiding military campaigns. I especially liked his descriptions of how Goths incorporated the ius civilum and ius gentium (Roman rule of law) and taxation and how Theodoric managed to coopt the Gallo-Roman landowner elites into the Gothic military. This essentially providing a natural continuation of the Western Roman Empire; in Spain, there was eventually a complete merger between Visigothic and Hispano-Roman populations. As mentioned in other reviews, the book is focused on political events - strategic alliances, dynastic succession wars, relationship to Rome, discords between gothic factions at the expense of in depth analysis of gothic religion, beliefs, lifestyle or even military strategy. Heather successfully highlights the acumen Goths needed to balance the expansionist tendencies of neighboring Franks, Burgundians, Heruli, Gepids, Huns etc, not to mention the constant tension generated by Byzantine meddling and scheming. A separate couple of chapters are rightfully devoted to Theodoric, probably one of the greatest strategic geniuses of the early Middle Ages. Although he tried hard, Theodoric had no heirs and, eventually, intergothic rivalries coupled with Byzantine machinations (notably, the campaign by Belisarius, one the best generals in B. history. Eventually, the Ostrogothic kingdom fragmented and fell, unable to match heavy calvary of Clovis' Franks. Although Goths dissapeared as an organized force by the mid-7th century, their presence can be seen in the blond beauties depicted in rennaissance portraits, and in the looks of many Northern Italians and Spaniards today.This is a well-written and readable expose, one of the best sources on Goths available to the lay reader.

This is an excellent book. De Mello went far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma by addressing what (to me) is one of the most important practical and existential issues facing us: how does one learn to live one's life with the bittersweet delightfulness that accompanies us when we manage to be present and aware. In other words, how do we learn to become a free person. Typically, our awareness is clouded by others' expectations and by our desires to escape the perceived unpleasantness of the present moment. In order to free ourselves from the desires and escapism we need to be aware; de Mello's book is a classic (and still unsurpassed) manual that guides us into the conscious universe where we can finally heave a sigh of relief and start enjoying this great gift of life.

Lake has studied with Lakota, Iroquois and Karuk/Yurok teachers (the well known Karuk medicine man Charlie Red Hawk was one of them).The author provides us with interesting information on native dreaming practices. Dreams have always been mportant to the Indans; consequently, sets of highly specialized techniques for lucid dreaming and efficient retrieval of the dream material (similarities to Tibetans here) can be found across many different tribes. "To become a medicine person", writes Lake, "you must have faith in the Great Creator, the dreams, the spirits, the good powers, and in yourself. At first dreams bring the calling and initiation into shamanhood; later they become tools for self-discovery, spiritual self-development, protection, diagnosis and healing." According to Lake, all illness has a symbolic component. "In order to heal the patient, the source of "stress" - the symbol, the physical object, the form of power and the fear associated with it - must be transformed and eradicated." Interesting stuff: to heal the patient one has to address both the physical and the mental/spiritual. Modern medicine (the "integrative medicine") is discovering the same thing these days. Nihil sub sole novum!The book provides specific information on sweat lodges, vision quests and on lake's training as a native healer. One basic message is that the path of a native shaman is filled with trials and tribulations. Lake has learnt his trade the hard way and he doesn't want the reader to forget it. For me, one of the highlights of the book is his interview with Tela Starhawk (his ex-wife), a formidable medicine woman in her own right, talking about female shamanic practices.What I like in this book are the descriptions of Native attitudes towards nature and life - the reverence for all living creatures and the sensitivity and awareness of the signs, through which nature speaks to us. I recommend it.

I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable. The story line is simple and, in some way, rather unimportant - Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, is returning from Rome to act in front of her home audience in a play directed by her new lover Ugo. The play is Pirandello's Come Tu Mi Vuoi, a classical work (written for his lover Martha Abba) about a woman pinned between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion. Throughout the film Rivette switches his camera between the play and Camille and Ugo's "reality" as if to ask us who are the real Camille and Ugo. What do they really want? What makes them tick? Can I, the spectator, enter their scriptless universe? Rivette (and his excellent actors) show us that delicateness can be robust and inventive, that desire for another can never be fulfilled and yet that the fulfillment does not really matter, because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative. What matters is style; style is substance. We are also treated to a brilliant depiction of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French and there is a delicious succession of nuances, hints and plays with the national stereotypes that brought many a smile to my face.I can see why some - those used to Hollywood cliches with their happy endings and oh so predictable plots - might not find the movie to be that hot. Well, that's just too bad....

This is an interesting book in which professional anthropologists dared to put off their straightjackets (if only for a second) to voice their suspicion - that the emperor is naked indeed. One cannot escape a suspicion that for many of the authors academic anthropology as we know it today is a mostly useless discipline designed to confirm its own superstitions which have little to do with real life and everything with timidity and capitulation to the social consensus. This is, I fear, rather clear to most interested outsiders.... and increasingly to the anthros themselves (especially the younger ones willing to stick out their neck for their beliefs).The authors of the book chapters all profess (more or less timidly) their disenchantement with the discipline and narrate their own "extraordinary" experiences which cannot be fit within the framework of science as we know it. For anyone even remotely acquainted with native spiritual practices these experiences are all rather tame and unsurprising (i mean...what is all the fuss about?) yet it it may be useful to pause for a moment and realize that for your run o' the mill antropologist they represent nothing if not revolutionary revisions of reality as he/she knows it. For example, one implication of the authors' experiences is that using statistics and "models" to address the role of awareness in creating reality is like using the proverbial flashlight in the search of darkness. As a result, this book has been conveniently ignored in the field and its authors more or less marginalized.Still... the edifice is crumbling and this book is bringing portents of its eventual downfall.

This is a slow and delicate film that touches human life at its core. It makes you stop and ask: What am I living for? WHat is important in my life? What have I learnt? in other words.... What would I like to take with me when I go.The actors act with an immediacy that is direct, refreshing and sweet - there is little self-consciousness usually involved in "acting" ... possibly also because the Japanese are much less obsessed with the "self" than us Westerners.In any case, the director did a superb job in coaxing the actors to be real, and he did it with VERY little money. If yu want to see a movie that will touch your heart and make you stop, and actually become aware of your life and its path, see After Life.

Michael Savage - born in Brooklyn as a humble M. Wiener, obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley in, listen to this, "nutritional ethnomedicine." In other words, young Michael (like most of his fellow neocons) used to be an idealistic liberal studying a New Age program in a left-wing West Coast soviet. Now what has happened in Weiner's life to effect such a radical transformation into a mouthpiece of right-wing weirdness?The most logical explanation is that New Age does not pay these days. The only place where Michael was able to get a job was the local right-wing radio station (yes, there actually is one in SF). This is where Political Zoo began. And once Wiener found his niche, he realized attacking his fellow human beings brings him much more pleasure than gorging up on taro, lovo and kokoda. Not to mention the money and notoriety that he gets from his right wing sponsors. What are pesky principles, dignity and self-respect anyway!The most striking observation about this book is its bare-bone misanthropy: Wiener appears to dislike most every human he encounters, excepting the GWB "Bumblebee" and Cheney the "Mt. Goat", the arguably worst presidential pair in recent history. His dislike includes his fellow competitors on the radio. Here is what he has to say about Rush (the "Hush Bimbo"):"Limbaugh has often been trumpeted as an amphibian of towering intellect, and that is true, at least in comparison to Hannity and O'Reilly. But that is a mighty small intellectual pond to be a big frog in. This bullfrog also champions family values. He just hasn't gotten around to practicing them. He's had more wives than original thoughts and no children, at least that anyone knows about. Even more entertaining than frog's mating habits is the ongoing story of his admitted drug abuse. Rush, for years, flatly condemned drug abusers. Once he got busted, though, he croaked a different tune. If this had been James Carville, Rush would have him boiled. Instead he was getting boiled himself, and in his own hot water. Rush puts the hypo into hypocrisy. "Now this rare glimpse of sobriety (sparked by professional envy) is undercut by Wiener's attacks on his fellow Americans that sometimes appear to verge on the border of incoherence. Anthropologically speaking, i find the transformation from an aspiring New Age gourmand and Fijian aficionado into a right-wing radio showman intriguing and perhaps even amusing. Of course, Wiener is not alone in taking advantage of conservatives' lack of education and their naivete. Radio edutainment and rabble-rousing has become big business for the unscrupulous and the opportunists with smooth tongues and easy morals.In the spectrum of right-wing attack squads that range from the ivory tower of (endangered and possibly extinct) East Coast WASPs such as Bill Buckley, via the personal greed, immorality and opportunism of neocons (such as Perle, Kristol and Podhoretz) to the trailer park (inhabited by the likes of Coulter, Hannity and O'Reilly), Wiener, the aspiring ethnobotanist-turned savage, inhabits a distinct category with his buddy Glenn Beck - that of a self-interested ideologue who's found a cozy way to make a living. As they say, all conservative people are not stupid, but most stupid people are conservative.

This book starts with a personal confession:"I believe in Gods, spirits and devils, and that they have communicated with humankind. I have a personal "testimony" of Jesus as my God, of Joseph Smith, Jr., as a prophet, of the book of Mormon as the word of god, and of the LDS church as a divinely established organization through which men and women can obtain priesthood ordinances of eternal consequence" (p. xxxviii).And then, Michael Quinn's book makes it transparently clear that Joseph "Joe" Smith's religion represents a collage of Christian, occult and Freemason sources that were easily available in 19th century Palmyra, NY. Smith's family was haunted by the occult. The book displays images of magical parchments, occult talismans, pouches and cabalistic/astrological inscriptions that used to be in the possession of the family. Neither were the Smiths innocents when it came to the supernatural: one of the ancestors might have been an accuser of Salem, MA "witches" and share responsibility for their murders. Smith Sr. and Jr. dug for magical 'treasures' whenever they could find time, used "seeing stones" and folk / ceremonial magic that was based upon medieval European and Freemason sources. Joe himself was familiar with pseudo-Agrippa, Paracelsus, Rosicrucian and Freemason lore and, especially, Swedenborg. He apprenticed to local occultists. His brother Hyrum was a Freemason who owned an athame ("an astrologically inscribed dagger for drawing magic circles"), and inscribed parchments describing rituals of ceremonial magic. According to the family's neighbors, early mormon converts were "profound believers in witchcraft, ghosts, goblins etc..." (P. 239).According to Quinn, every single piece of Mormon lore -the plates, the Urim/Thumim, the visions, the toad/angel "Moroni", "Egyptian hieroglyphs" identified with the Book of Mormon etc can be traced to what was happening in Palmyra/USA in the early 1800s. Mormon names such as Lehi, Nephi, Nephesh, Laman etc were derived from King James' Bible & cabalistic texts. Encyclopedias available at the time linked jewish cabala with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Not surprisingly, the opening words in the Book of Mormon align "learning of the Jews" with the "language of the Egyptians."Joe, from what i can tell, embodies the essential trickster archetype together with an incredible talent for grandiosity, self-promotion and for telling a good tale. Today some of his 'prophecies' seem somewhat ...overinspired. In 1837 he prophesied to Oliver Huntington: "Inhabitants of the Moon are more of a uniform size than the inhabitants of the Earth, being about 6 feet in height. They dress very much like the Quaker Style and quite general in Style, or the one fashion of dress. They live to be very old; coming generally near a thousand years." Good ole Joe, bless him.Every 'vision' was rapidly announced and 'revealed' which led to comical (and dangerous) situations as the young men who were induced by Smith to dig for magical treasures all over Palmyra between 1820-1826 wanted to have their share of promised loot ("golden plates inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs"). Needless to say, the plates - which represent the cornerstone of the Mormon religion - were never available to hoi polloi because they were spirited away by angels.As it happens, contemporary LDS leaders often appear to champion views that are the opposite of what Joe Smith believed and preached. Magical and occult elements - a fundamental aspect of Joe's worldview - have been minimized, as has been JSmith's emphasis on the necessity of having plural wives (possibly one of the main raisons d'etre for establishing mormonism). Instead, today there is an emphasis on worldly success, status, obedience, political control and the Republican party. As opposed to early Mormons who were convinced that the Earth was alive, that it had a personal spirit and that it was capable of speech, birth, breathing, transgression, sexual reproduction and resurrection (P. 214), it seems that many (perhaps most) contemporary Mormons don't believe in Earth's aliveness, the need to take care of it, global warming, in free healthcare, in nature as something to be treasured.When the text appears rambling (which it often does) it's because Quinn feels it necessary to add yet another layer of evidence to ward off his detractors at the Brigham Young University. Despite having produced what may be considered the definitive account of the occult origins of Mormonism, worldly rewards in the LDS country have been meager for Quinn. Powers that be - LDS "Apostles" and "Prophets" in Salt Lake City - do not appreciate empirical analysis too close to home. Quinn was promptly excommunicated after the first publication of the book. Next, he lost his job at the BYU and his community. A clear sign that, while Broadway shows are OK, too deep an investigation of occult Mormonism is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.In other words, the Apostles' reaction represents a clear sign that Quinn touched upon something real. The writing of this book was a courageous act, I see it as no less than the embodiment of the human desire to live a life, and walk one's personal spiritual path, in truth. We can only hope that the LDS church will eventually choose facts over fiction. That will be the day when trumpets will sound across the Heavens.

There are moments in the healing dance when I feel I am standing in a ray of light. In this light I am able to see inside others. I see everything as if I'm inside you.... The light sometimes seems to be inside other people. That light is given to us to see into others so we can find out what is wrong.Mamolelo Shikwe, Bushman DoctorThis book provides a fascinating account of the spiritual universe of Kalahari Bushmen, mostly as a series of first-hand accounts from the "doctors". Keeney has spent a lot of time in Kalahari and has written a lot about his experiences there. In this book, he takes a back seat and allows the Bushmen to speak for themselves. I was fascinated by the love these people have for God and for each other, a love which is uncomplicated, obvious and delightful, without the burdens of expectation or rationalization. It is simple - when one is happy, one loves. Dancing is a primary technology Bushmen use to enter that space of cleansing and communion with oneself and one's fellow beings. Bushmen healers obtain their "power" during healing dances. The power can come from ancestors, totem animals or directly from the Big God. The doctors themselves describe in great detail how this power arises in the belly, rises up and leaves the body "as steam" from the top of the head; then it falls down to the ground, rises through the feet and starts the process again. The process of becoming a doctor entails mastering this cycle of energy. Interesting parallels with some Eastern methods for manipulating Qi.An initiate learns to see "lines or strings of light that go up to the sky" as well as horizontal lines across the physical world and learns to travel along these lines. In the sky one meets the ancestors:"The oldest Bushmen ancestors have heads of animals, usually that of the eland. While I'm up in the sky village I may learn from the old ones or from the Big God. When it's time to come down the rope of light I bring the entire village (of ancestors) down with me to the ground where the dance is held. This is a very special moment. When this takes place, the whole community enters a spiritual time and space where the past and present are brought together as a singular moment."While the material is fascinating, the way it was put together is somewhat haphazard and the "antropological" discussion at the end way too simplistic. Keeney is well aware of the difficulties in presenting and analzying something as fluid and as intangible as experiences of these doctors, each of whom has a different way of describing what they see and do and he basically leaves it at that. Still, this is a worthwhile book to get your hands on.

Liz Gilbert almost got me. As she starts her Italian adventure I was preparing myself for a pulpy read with easy (and possibly undeserved) laughs. And before that, the Amazon reviews almost scared me away. Boy, what a mistake that'd be! This is a spiritual book in the true sense of the word. Although I kept laughing throughout the book, its simplicity is deceptive. Between the lines, Gilbert is about so much more: vitality, coming into one's own, creating reality and matching the soul's aspirations to the delicious unpredictability of life.After divorcing her husband (who is portrayed rather unflatteringly as a greedy and vindictive sob) the author decamps for the fountains of Rome where she makes great friends, samples excellent food and learns about the pleasure of dolce far niente from the world's masters in this important art. Here is a quote from Liz's book on why Italy, which has produced some of the greatest artistic, political and scientific minds of all ages, has never become a major world power: The Italian history of corruption by local leaders (a la Mussolini and Berlusconi) and exploitation by foreign dominators [France, Austria, Spain etc]"has led Italians to draw the seemingly accurate conclusion that nobody and nothing in this world can be trusted. Because the world is so corrupted and unfair, one should trust only what one can experience with one's one senses, and THIS makes senses stronger in Italy than anywhere in Europe. This is why Italians will tolerate hideously incompetent generals, presidents, tyrants, professors, journalists and captains of industry but will never tolerate incompetent opera singers, conductors, ballerinas, courtesans, actors, cooks and tailors. Sometimes only beauty can be trusted. Only artistic excellence is incorruptible. Pleasure cannot be bargained down. And sometimes the meal is the only currency that is real."This book is essentially revolving about beauty - of friendship, inner life, good taste (and food) and, not least, the ever elusive bounty that is bestowed by a life that is lived well.In India Liz stays in a celebrity ashram north of Bombay where she has a couple of transcendent experiences whereas in Bali she befriends locals in the beautiful town of Ubud. In fact, her capacity for friendship - the genius of it - together with the honest and unflinching ability to face herself is something that I found very cool. So what if she has bad taste when it comes to men? To me, her naivete in all things male is simply a (n attractive) measure of her femininity and humanness. In any case, Liz's description of finding her inner strength is better than those of most self-styled guru and self-help "authority" out there, including by the controversial Gurumayi herself.As I started to write my review in here i was kinda surprised (actually i wasn;t surprised at all) how violently some people react to the book. There is some real vitriol here, doubtlessly reflecting the (very real) American horror of idleness and pleasure, of decoupling from the "productive" life of the hive. There seem to be many, oh so many, envious and unfulfilled divorcees out there. To me it seems that many reviewers can't decide whether they are more insulted by Liz's snub of Puritan ethics or her hedonic streak, glamor (the bit of it that seeps between the lines) and courage to end a suffocating marriage. I imagine the very idea of spending a year "finding oneself" is anathema to the hard working hoi polloi. Yet - what else matters in this vale of tears?A second set of reviewers is responding with a weary "been there done that" (lived amongst the Afghans and the Okies, spent time in ashrams, etc, haha) - never realizing that is the *spirit* of the author, her natural inclination to befriend her fellow humans and not to be better than they are, that represents a main draw of the book.Is it true that one can live one's life in an ever expanding circle of vitality and joy? Liz Gilbert gives us a resounding YES. So what if she was paid to write about herself - this is what travel writers do for living. Having had my share of humbling and uplifting experiences I know for sure that she is not faking anything - her spiritual insights are the real deal. In my mind, she provides us with a XXI century (US) version of Lawrence Durrell's travelogues - only more light-hearted, self-deprecating and courageous. Bravissima!

... it starts and ends with you...(Rancid)" . This is a fast paced and happy punk album with a lot of ska. The songs are forceful (Roots Radicals; Listed MIA) and sometimes wistful (Olympia, WA); Maxwell Murder is classical punk and i (contrary to some reviewers here) like its unbridled energy. The production is simple, which makes this album even better in my eyes. In short, this is a great band and this CD is one of their best; they enjoyed themselves doing this album and it shows. I recommend it.

Nobel Laureates, before leaving this vale of tears, search for meaningful and profound challenges. Many of them settled on the question of consciousness and the brain. Jack Eccles proposed consciousness resides in dendrites and "psychons"; Gerry Edelman suggested that it is inherent in coordinated firing within 'neuronal assemblies'; Francis Crick suggested that, astonishingly, consciousness is nothing but the sum total of neuronal activity whereas Roger Penrose, a physicist, speculated that consciousness may originate from quantum effects caused by "non-computable collapses of the wave function" in the brain.Enter a gaggle of second order theorists who took these ideas and ran with them. A psychologist named Pribram imagined that the brain functions as a quantum holograph machine that is somehow channeling Bohm's 'implicate order'. People featured in this DVD range from semi-crackpots (Hameroff & Chalmers) to researchers who have capitalize on their empirical credentials with excessive ego-driven enthusiasm (Ramachandran). Like Pribram who had no compunctions about extrapolating hard core physiology of De Valoises to nebulous ideas about quantum free will, other theorists happily invent theories with fancy sounding names (usually including the word 'quantum'). Hameroff, for example, is an anesthesiologist who combined the least appealing and verifiable aspects of Pribram's, Eccles' and Penrose's hypotheses into the idea that consciousness is subserved by quantal entanglements at the level of microtubules (cytoskeletal scaffold molecules that impart rigidity to cells). Never mind that there is close to zero experimental evidence for macroscopic quantum effects in the brain. Or that Hameroff willfully displays fundamental ignorance of basic brain physiology (witness his idea bout the role of 'gap junctions'). Thinking, like Chalmers and Bierman appear to, that the brain is an enormous quantum machine which "collapses wave packets" sounds cool but is a bit delusional and certainly unsupported by evidence. And the idea that robots will one day build still more intelligent robots is, well, worthy of manga comics.It seems that these guys have created an alternate scientific reality that operates in parallel to peer review system and the scientific consensus. Tis' simple: you create an unsolvable, "hard", problem and suggest an unfalsifiable approach to resolve it - and voila, you get a plum job at the University of Arizona. To paraphrase David Joravsky - Hameroff, Pribram, Chalmers and friends "invent mysteries or nonsense, or both together." The only interviewee who actually makes sense amongst this roster of scientific, philosophical and intellectual pretense is Willoughby Britton, a graduate student.I think DVDs like this appeal to people who like "The Secret" or "What the Bleep" by lending a patina of 'science' to the belief du jour. But it has little, if anything, to do with real science. Or reality.

In this book Villoldo provides us with a glimpse into Andean healing practices. Each chapter begins with an excerpt from Villoldo's Journal written during his training sesions with the teachers from the Q'ero nation, and with the healers he encountered in the Peruvian and Brazilian rainforest. Villoldo then goes on to describe the foundations of energy medicine and ends most chapters with simple exercises to give us the taste of what he is writing about. Myself i am interested in parallels between various shamanic practices and energy training in martial arts and SHS provided several useful tips. However, the practical usefulness of this book is probably limited, because even the simplest exercises need verification and support by a qualified teacher.I find the information in this book to be (to the best of my knowledge) accurate, provided by a competent and well-trained specialist. The stories about the Q'ero shamans and their training are especially interesting. These people have a sophisticated understanding of consciousness and of the issues related to death and dying. As all indigenous shamans, they are intimately connected to nature and show amazing skills taping forces residing within the majestic landscape of the Cordilleras. i think it is high time we start to look at the Q'ero with new respect.In my view this is probably one of the best books available on Peruvian shamanism and its applicability to the Western practice of "integrative medicine". i recommend it.

Precolombian Mexicas did not see the Universe as engaged in a monumental struggle between good and evil; most gods had both positive and negative aspects (for example, there were four forms of Tezcatlipoca, some good, some bad). This book shows that men and women that Spaniards called 'witches' were respectable members of the pre-Columbian society, with an ability to shape-shift, heal and send diseases. Following the arrival of Spaniards, the perceived universe suddenly assumed the reflection of a monumental fight between good and evil: A Judeao-Xian God and a devil with his demons (often representing ancient Meso-American deities).The Indians quickly got the basic idea. Old style 'medicine work' became 'witchcraft' (brujeria) associated with the devil and its practitioners became devil's associates. This belief is still very much alive in Southwest as well as in Mexico proper.Simmons, the historian laureate of New Mexico provides examples from old Spanish archives compiled by inquisitors and civil/military authorities on the topic of witchcraft trials in the 18-19th century Southwest pueblos and Navajo lands. Luckily for the accused natives, the Domini Canes of the Spanish Inquisition were different from their murderous counterparts in German- and French speaking countries and often overturned the accusations of witchcraft lodged by Spanish settlers and Pueblo Indians against their neighbors.There are a few sketchy accounts of Navajo 'skinwalkers. Most stories involve disputes between early Spanish settlers and natives (usually women, usually poor) accused of witchcraft. The book is at its strongest when dealing with the examples of Pueblo witchcraft, where the excesses of witchhunting were most egregious and in some cases led to demise of entire villages and Pueblos. The Zuni, Isletas, Yumas and Mojaves all draw the witches up by their hands until they confessed...and were executed in order to nullify their evil power. Everyoine who was even little bit unusual quickly became a suspect during a drought, or an influenza epidemic. Likewise, anyone who excels in any endeavour, or becomes rich comes under suspicion as their energies appear to be devoted to personal aggrandizement rather than the common good. This attitude has survived in a milder fashion to this day.Needless to say, these are stories unlikely to be heard by the casual visitor to the Southwest. The Indians are notoriously reticent and in the case of witchcraft, they do not talk at all. Clyde Kluckhohn himself had to develop a number of ingenious strategies to make Navajos spill their beans (often by picking up hitchikers who were less concerned about being seen...). The book provides a welcome introduction into this fascinating area...definitely recommended for pueblo visitors.

i had to have a look after all this hype and the book was worse than i feared. the chapters are annoyingly short and end with what are probably supposed to be cliffhangers, but what they do is chop the story into frilly little pieces. Brown's previous Vatican story was much better.The characters are 2D, laden with cliches and damned with a thin plot. Although the book contains a number of clever riddles and juicy historical factoids, the author can never decide whether he is giving a lecture on history, religious iconography and conspiracy theories or whether he is actually writing a thriller. as a result, there are pages and pages of irrelevant stuff while the plot itself is thin and moves at lightning speed.not that i mind the subject topic - in fact, i find Knights Templar, medieval legends, da Vinci et consortes captivating. yet if you are writing a novel, Dan, please write the novel, not a philosophical sermon or a Morality Play.And now I have to imagine Hanks as Langdon &lt;shudder>

I've always loved Belly. There is something...something extra there. Tanya's voice overs, dubs, many of the songs give a feeling that that band was creating out of the mainstream. Like, there is refreshing absence of over-professionalism and pretension, showmanship like one sees with their contemporaries like 9IN. Sweetness, but with an edge.Feed the tree is, I'd say, one of he best songs of the 90s. Especially the lyrics.I also like their version of Are You Experienced. They bring this song, its energy, into a very interesting place.

There is great clarity in this singer. Bruni knows exactly what she wants. And, as we know, she usually gets it.On the minus side, i could discern little progress in her musical or poetic evolution - the same throaty, self-consciously husky voice, the same cords, musical progressions & song structure, the same half-singing/speaking as in other French and English pieces from previous CDs suggest lack of artistic ambition. I imagine that Bruni unabashedly chooses the hedonic, the sensual and the lyrical/poetic over music itself. That her self-understanding is frozen in some kind of a stasis box. Unlike - say - Sinead O'Connor or Sheryl Crow - she never commits the totality of her inner resources to the song; there is always a distance, a veil between the singer and the song and therefore, between the song and the listener.Nonetheless.There are some catchy tunes on this CD, my personal favorite is Raphal. And L'excessive. And, of course, "La plus belle du quartier"

This is a deep, touching, exquisitely crafted film. Everything is where it belongs. The focus is on humaneness - human fragility, authenticity and the mystery of life & death. Excellent script, great acting, impeccable directing. Eastwood took a bit of a risk here but he pulls it off as the master he is.

I am impressed by the subtle and precise film making in Invictus. Dialogue is sparse yet the film brims with emotion and passion of a decent person doing the right thing.Freeman's portrait of Mandela is the highlight of his career. He channels the decency, integrity, conviction, canniness and strategic brilliance of Mandela in a way that appears both deeply personal and deeply convincing. Ditto for Damon and Eastwood, and South African actors. A film like teaches between the lines. It hit me strongly.

This is one of the most intelligent and sophisticated series in this genre. Bakker creates a complex and convincing world of cultures, beliefs and histories that roughly corresponds to those of early medieval Europe, with Nansur reflecting Imperial Rome; Kianene: Arabs; Scylvendi: Huns& Scythians; Thunyeri: Goths, etc. These nations are thrust into a Crusade with Inrithi (Christians) assaulting Fanims (Moslems), which is engineered by non-human beings with tremendous occult powers. These beings are ancient, sadistic and aim to exterminate humankind in order to save their own souls....They can only be stopped by one man with special powers developed through eugenics and meditative, psychological and scientific experimentation developed by his lineage of 'Dunyain' monks.The book is rife with sorcery and magic, which for Bakker consist of a combination of intellectual clarity, passion and intent: "Preserving and expressing the pure modalities of meaning, THIS is the heart of all sorcery. With each word you must strike the perfect semantic pitch, the note that will drown out the chorus of reality," explained the sorcerer Achamian. The book brings forth a number of distinct and competing sorceric schools, each with each own distinct metaphysics and techniques for forming and empowering ideas. One of such techniques is to say and think two different things at once.The book grapples with semi-philosophical ideas and theses that are both modern and ancient. These include causality, semantics, perception, metaphysics...the paramount question for Bakker seems to be what do people perceive as real, and how they can be manipulated and deceived through making them learn the truth about themselves. The main protagonist of the series is Anasurimbor Kellhus, a Zen monk-like royal figure so heavily trained in meditation, philosophy, self-awareness and bodily reflexes that he can anticipate, overcome and manipulate human and inhuman opponents alike. There is something almost helpless in Kellhus' need to control his fellow humans, in his rationalist deliberateness and in absence of human emotion and passion in his actions - passion to Kellhus is something to be dominated and controlled rather than celebrated.Two parallel plots in the book provide necessary suspense: that of a brilliant and ruthless Scylvendi warrior Cnaiur, and a bumbling, emotional and insecure sorcerer Achamian. To me these two characters provided more enjoyment than the narrative that focused 'warrior prophet'. The battle scenes are excellent - detailed and imaginative. As opposed to, say, Jordan's books, Bakker kills many central characters in his series. However, the conclusion in TT is kind of unconvincing, few important issues get resolved and one is compelled to think that Bakker is working on a sequel. Which would be a good thing.Kellhus' invincibility and lack of humaneness can be a bit irritating and philosophical discussions may get a bit naive at times. Nonetheless, this is a well-written book, worth reading both for the plot and the ideas. Bakker is definitely a writer to watch.

A monk asked master Chi-Chen: "What is the way upward?" The master replied, "You will hit it by descending lower."This is a valuable book written by a competent scientist/MD on a topic of great importance. Is it possible to change our experience of ourselves and the world through dedicated practice - in other words, is it possible to become a happy person? Buddhism and other religions have always claimed this is possible if one dedicated oneself to a thorough investigation of one's own perception and cognition. Modern science approaches these questions from another end - it has succeeded in elucidating many of the key biological mechanisms which underlie brain function (such as attention, perception, cognition and dreaming). This book combines insights obtained from both endeavours and thus provides a welcome bridge between the meditation methods sharpened through thousands of years of practice and modern neuroscience.The book is composed of four parts: (1) an intro on physiological effects of meditation is a thoughtful compilation of evidence gathered from (mostly) TM and zen meditators. Austin describes the changes in brain physiology (coherence in EEG activity, changes in oxygen consumption, breathing patterns), cognition (changes in perception, attention) and the long-range positive changes in attitude that occur in serious meditators; this part also includes a very competent overview of the effects of psychedelics on both brain activity and behaviour (2) a compendium of brain anatomy/physiology/chemistry which is a bit confusing and way too detailed. probably too simplistic for an expert and way too complicated for a layman; many findings described here are likely to be already out of date or to become so within the next couple of years. (3) a description of Buddhist and zen philosophy and practice which i find to be excellent (4) There are interesting accounts of Austin's own experiences during zen meditation - which include kensho (experience of "enlightenement"). i especially liked his speculations on the relationship between zen practice and personal growth. i found them useful because, as opposed to the recapitulation of other people's work, Austing here finally integrates the material via his own insights and experiences.In summary, I found this book to be worthwhile and interesting (if at times tedious). A wonderful thing about it is that it was written by an eminent neurologist and scientist (a Professor Emeritus, no less) who has immersed himself in an arduous and unflinching investigation of his personal experience of the world. This book thus represents an impressive bridge between quality science and quality zen practice and a welcome step towards integration of true phenomenology (meditation) and of open-minded empiricism. The week point of this book is its lack of organization: Austin tends to add new stuff when he runs into it and he tends to do this rather haphazardly. As a result, the book lacks focus, things get repeated in different sections and there are large differences in the quality between the (158!) chapters. Still, these objections pale before the dedication required to complete this project and the gifts we receive while partaking of it.

This is a morbid and pretentious film. A fairy tale that champions brutality under the guise of condemning it.I can understand del Toro has no love for the Phalange, but to cloak his politics into a morbid tale serves (at least as far as this reviewer is concerned) no purpose.i give him an extra star for sound effects, tho'. And for the sheer eeriness and unpleasantness of the film.

yes, this is what one gets from a young guy who got enlightened in, what, two weeks with the well known INdian "teacher of Masters" Poonja . a couple of weeks was enough to propel Cohen into the guru circuit in the West... sadly enough, the sensitive and talented young man never got a chance ... to be simply human being who actually works for life. its one thing, as this book shows, to fly the Advaita shuttle, another altogether to live an impeccable life.the "enlightenement" experience is recounted ad nauseam by Cohen... who tends to forget, conveniently, that Poonja soon denounced him as a fake guru, publicity seeker, a bully and a fraud.It is not that Cohen is saying wrong stuff - the problem is that, like Rajneesh before him, what he says is close to irrelevant given WHO's talking and what he DOES (for a hilarious read check out his mother's book The Mother of God).I'd take this book as a striking example of the danger lurking in letting the ego seduce one into a "teacher".... and of getting derailed by sudden, overwhelming, all-powerful realizations. Cohen needs disciples like he needs air... and that is fishy.be that as it may...caveat emptor

This book is a step back from the previous tome in which Pinchbeck described his experiences with a variety of drugs including hallucinogens such as yage, Psilocybe mushrooms, DMT and iboga. In contrast to the previous book (as superficial as it is), however, the new one is incoherent, simplistic, rambling and has little if anything to do with Quetzalcoatl, Nahua mythology or Meso-American "prophecies". While Pinchbeck seems to have wormed his way into the epicenter of the New Age pseudo-shamanic lecture circuit, he seems to have lost his inspiration and enthusiasm with the very subject topics one would expect him to be most familiar with. There is no scholarship in this book, and even less original insights/teachings from indigenous cultures that use plant substances for religious ceremonies and spiritual growth. Rather, we see is a conspiracy - type pablum along the lines of David Icke's 'alien invaders and body snatchers'. Kind of sad.... looks like a promising young man lost his way.To learn about the history of Tollan, Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, ancient Meso-American beliefs or their calendar(s), I'd recommend books by David Carrasco or Henry Nicholson.

This is an interesting book that offers a glimpse into the mindset of orthodox Catholicism (!) in which deviation from dogma is a sin deserving eternal punishment. Entirely fictional, of course, on par with medieval morality plays. Or we could look at it as an opportunity for a stressed priest to shed anguish over the increasingly agnostic Western culture by indulging in a bit of lurid creative fiction writing. It has been done before:If I were a cassowaryOn the plains of Timbuctoo,I would eat a missionary,Cassock, band, and hymn-book too(ascribed to bishop Samuel Wilberforce, 1805-1873)In this opus we get to meet five characters, each of which embodies an aspect of catholic opprobrium. First, Marianne - a rebellious girl seeking to "find herself" - is tempted by "nothingness" (a jab at Buddhism here). The second story involves two priests seeking to commune with nature while beginning to doubt the Church dogma about evolution (i.e., dinosaurs frolicking about 6000 BC). Is it possible evolution followed the rules of natural selection? Can scientific evidence trump a "holy book" written in the Bronze Age? One of the two has appreciation for (oh horror of horrors!) that gentlest and profoundest of catholic theologians, Teilhard de Chardin - a weakness in moral constitution which in itself invites in the demonic spheres. The other priest, "Jonathan", manifests possession as he blesses his parishioners "in the name of Sky, Earth and Water." The third victim, Richard, is a transexual who also was tempted into sin through nature. I am including Martin's description of the moment in which Richard yields to evil: [he is alone in nature, on a vision quest as part of a boy scout expedition]"he felt surrounded by shapes and presences which had lain hidden or dormant. Fear was gone. Only perplexity remained. The wind in the pines and the light on the water were part and parcel of those presences. But there was something else he could not recognize, could only accept or struggle to reject. Something spoke in the wind and shone in the light. All together, these mysterious things wove a web around his perplexity, washing it in a strange grace and, at the same time, softening some part of him that was supposed to be hard and insoluble, but was becoming soft, supple, diffuse, flowing into some mystery. ... He felt his body shudder as if shaking off scales or armor. His body seemed to hold the possibility of all natural things at once. He knew it was incredible. He remembers murmuring 'I have yielded...against my training.' "This, my friends, was the moment of possession. Can you see what Martin is doing here? He invents an inner dialogue in which communing with nature and all things natural becomes tantamount to renouncing Christian faith. He warns his audience from relaxing into the wind and stars because this means temptation by the Devil. This of course reflects the very real fear that the Church, increasingly abandoned by young people, has of "Earth-loving" spiritual traditions, and of naturalness itself. As Opus Dei sees it, anyone who favors inner growth and searches for the inner light rather than blindly goose-stepping to scholastic dogma surely must be under the dominion of dark powers.Disconcertingly,the book is riddled from beginning to end with perverse language, spiced throughout with deviantly sexual dialogue that can only reflect twisted imagination of someone who has been tormented by a vow of abstinence. As far as Opus Dei and Martin are concerned, anything that strays from the most rigid and dogmatic catholic doctrine is automatically tainted with evil. Gurdjieff and the Enneagram are entryways into possession, as is meditation, loving-kindness practices and even simple self-inquiry. I am shocked by the profound absence of health, kindness and gentleness or simple sympathy, in this book. Anyone who gets a kick out of shepherding human souls into a pen of fear must be experiencing a profound inner split, perhaps even a case of multiple personalities. Is this the Christ's message to this world? I doubt it. It seems more like its opposite, as if the catholic hierarchy was taken over by the very "powers and forces" it is ostensibly fighting against. A case in point, Ratzinger's obsession with power (witness the new financial scandals in the Vatican and their treatment of American nuns).From the anthropological perspective the phenomenon of possession is real in that it is known in most cultures on this planet. It has both culture-specific and universal aspects. According to Felicitas Goodman, there are interesting parallels - but also differences - between older (and apparently more vicious) African variants and newer, European versions. Martin, unfortunately, is muddying the waters here in order to disseminate the propaganda from the most conservative, and out-of-touch, corridors of Vatican. The book is worth reading just for that.

This film is an almost perfect flop. The characters are rigid, wooden, emotionally dull and unidimensional, the script fuzzy and pointless; in other words, the film reflects a not-very- bright dopester's idea of a fun and profound life. Unfortunately, Anderson seems to be oblivious of the fact that Yellow Submarine has already been made - 40 years ago by people who were crazier, smarter and more creative than him.And the film is not funny! The tired pseudo-spirituality jokes and, especially, the boring and pointless 1st part which was made so that Wes could spend a week in Paris with Portman - help this film to tank utterly and completely.The India shown in DL is not the real India but an edited-into-oblivion, fantasized and disemboweled version of it. Nor do we see real Indians but rather bleached, sanitized non-entities, some (like the lovely Rita maid character) with a London accent.The only redeeming point here (in addition to the iPod gags) is the cinematography set into the beautiful landscapes of Rajasthan. The visuals (enhanced by a huge team of local painters) are excellent, warm blues, yellows and greens, the enhanced clarity of detail - as if everyone on the set was tripping. Which they probably were.

This book consists of a series of interviews ('darshans') through which Nisargadatta answers the basic question which reveals our human condition: while everyone wants to be THAT (Self, Enlightened, Realized) we do not want to let go of our accumulated beliefs, desires and perceived needs. Many questions asked of the master display a subtle desperation inherent in this predicament.Thirst for the divine can't be met because we are looking for answers away from the Source. In this book, this thirst meets the rock-solid, unyielding, uncompromising presence of the master.When reading this book i keep saying to myself without intending to - "i love this man". The interviews give me a sense of trust, of direction, of presence.A great book.

Here we have someone who tries to forcibly mix two different paradigms, that of (not-so-modern) quantum physics and that of (not-so-archaic) shamanism. Had FAW been a really good theoretical or experimental physicist, or an impressive shaman, this work might have been a monumental achievement. Unfortunately, here we have a small time college physics teacher dabbling amateurishly with medicine work and - unsurprisingly - getting &quot;insights&quot; which never transcend the banal first-derivative of the simplistic analogy. This book is sentimental to boot and self-indulgent to the point of exhaustion and the unfortunate cayote reader can only growl with irritation at the lack of philosophical rigor combined with the shallowness of the author's autobiographical profile. I am sure Fred is quite a likeable guy and he appears to have dabbled in enough fields to gain some notoriety in New Age circles chasing a New Unified Theory of Everything. Those will find the book enjoyable. To everyone else I say: if you must read it, borrow it from the local library.

This is a lovely film with great visuals and quality acting. Gaiman's story unfolds many of the archetypal elements that have been captivating children and adults for centuries. Our fascination with the stars, magic kingdoms, evil witches is generously indulged in this story about a young man's quest for his adulthood and love.The film is peppered with funny moments and hints and one cannot escape the suspicion that the crew had a good time filming. Casting did a great job as well, Pfeiffer's role as the evil witch Lamia in particular is an acting tour de force. A thoroughly enjoyable film.

Richard Hayes is someone I would like to hang out with. He is knowledgeable, passionate about his interests, he is entertaining and also bitchy, which adds the requisite spice to the chicken soup we call Buddhism in the West. This book contains a collection of essays with a common thread based on Hayes' insistence on ethics and moral responsibility, his focus on what it means to be a true friend and, above all, his belief in the role of reason in the spiritual process (belief which itself borders on obsession). There isn't a transcendental bone in Hayes' body - witness sentences like: &quot;... i strongly believe (sic!) that the only basis upon which civilization can be built is the foundation of reason. It is my belief that the only means by which we become superhuman is to abandon all thought of supernatural and the transcendental and to focus all our attention and energy on the concrete and particular problems of that which we can observe and understand in this world&quot;. This Descartian-Jeffersonian Yankee pragmatism does not have all that much in common with the little Buddhism I know, but nevertheless is a welcome respite from the touchy feely &quot;Marin School of Buddhism for the Very Rich&quot; of the likes of Kornfield and Boorstein and it provides a good defense against rascally tricksters like Trungpa, Tendzin and the many zen masters. Unfortunately, part of this &quot;ethical Buddhism&quot; also involves a rather dogmatic rejection of sexuality (sex, according to H prevents us from being friends) and every other non-mind-based mode of expression of life, which would make H's Buddhism a bit boring and bland (not to mention that it is an oxymoron, since wanting to live one's life by following the dictates of one's reason only is definitely highly irrational). The book, i must stress however, is not boring at all - far from it. H. argues his case well and many paragraphs are pure gems. One of my favorites is the essay on Dr. BR Ambedkar, a brilliant law scholar who helped the untouchables in India to rebel against the perniciousness of the brahmanic system of social control - the caste. The Buddha himself pointed out that all divisions into race, caste, social class, religious group, language group etc. are unnatural and man-made and that trying to live on the basis of such divisions is a lie which has disastrous consequences for the humanity. This is the part of Buddhism that interests Hayes and it is here that we should explore with him what it means to live sensibly and with dignity. I recommend it highly.

Joanna Field is nom de plume of the well known British psychoanalyst Marion Milner. In this "psychological memoire" she reveals a 20-something woman living a somewhat charmed bohemian life of the early 1930-ies - travels across Yorkshire, Tuscany and Virginia/Massachusetts are superimposed on adventures and explorations of inner landscapes composed of dreams, memories, reflections ...and the unknown. The book, written in the form of a diary, is an excellent guide for anyone about to embark on the rewarding, if treacherous, journey of self discovery.Milner figured out, pretty much by herself, key elements of what these days passes as somatic psychotherapy. The art of listening to the body, to fears hiding in misty waters of the unconscious, and of opening to the delight that descends when we, often unsuspectingly and all too fleetingly, are graced by the authentic experience of living, are described in fascinating detail.How does one maintain authenticity when being with other people, what makes us happy, what brings us the sense of direction, how to observe thoughts, emotions and gestures, how to navigate the madscape of mental activity, how "facts" distill themselves out of the boundless background of the unknown, that immense kaleidoscope that keeps changing with our motives- in other words, what IS perception and what awareness... this book lays it all out in a human, so human and irresistible way. After the first chapter I felt an immediate kinship, affection and respect for this woman who died a long time ago, yet left us with this scintilla of honesty and insight. Highly recommended.

This book is important for several reasons. One of them is that Kingsley attempts to shake the ancient Greek scholarship by suggesting that Empedocles' Fragments need to be interpreted through language of the preclassical (~500 BC; ie, Empedocles') rather than classical (ie, Pericles) period. Here Kingsley is on firm ground, displaying an impressive familiarity with the Illiad and other preclassical literature. Bringing philology back on the map he continues the basic approach by Nietzsche and Heidegger.More importantly, PK brings philosophical inquiry into the domain of phenomenology of religion. if we wish to understand the presocratics we need primarily to understand their state of consciousness and their relationship to the spiritual sphere. While most classical scholars would argue that one can achieve such an understanding through deciphering the language, literature, history, art and economy of a society, the alternative view (championed by PK) is that attempts to explain Empedocles' philosophy in terms of ordinary social, political, etc. circumstance inevitably miss something that is not reducible to facts alone. It misses its essence, a foundation of Beingness where philosophy reflects the nature of human experience and its capacity to interact with the 'transpersonal' or numinous. A capacity that by no means is uniquely Greek.This is why classical scholarship addressing ancient (Greek, Egyptian, Mesopotamian etc) consciousness should not be entrusted to 'ordinary' scholarly nitpickers alone. The historian W. Brede once said: "When religion is the subject of our work, we grow religiously." Peter Kingsley is that rare scholar (an ex-Warburg fellow, no less) who appears to have been sucked into the ancient Pythagorean texts and magical practices they describe and emerged out of his studies a changed man.This book is a first step describing PKs beliefs about an inner meaning of Pythagoreanism (elegantly discussed in later books such as Reality) ...The book starts with a technical reinterpretation of the theory of 4 Elements ("the 4 Roots") for which Empedocles is mainly known; then continues with a critical evaluation of classical views of Empedocles; PK claims that Aristotle purposefully distorted E.s ideas whereas Plato actually appropriated many Pythagorean concepts following his visits to Pyth. communities in Southern Italy and Sicily. Appropriated and then pretended they were his own. To prove this, PK performs a detailed textual analysis of Phaedo.Egypt and ancient Greece shared a number of intellectual, philosophical and religious practices, from mathematics to the mysteries of death & rebirth (practiced in Eleusinian rituals) and the shamanic descent into the Underworld (seen in Orphic mysteries, Hermetic practices and 'funerary inscriptions' such as the Pyramid texts). Both Plato and Pythagoras spent a long time in Egypt and Empedocles, a direct heir of Pythagoras, would have been intimately aware of Egyptian religious beliefs. The circle was completed when Empedoclean texts returned to the Egyptian desert through Greek (gnostic, hermetic) communities living in the Egyptian desert. PK shows that certain Sufi texts from Egypt and even alchemical texts from the Middle Ages directly follow E.s writings and beliefs.There is a remarkable discussion of Pythagorean magic, initiatory rites, practice of 'incubation' and Orphic mysteries. The book is worth buying just for that third part."...I am a lover of learning, and trees and open country won't teach me anything, whereas men in the town do.", sez Socrates in Phaedrus, one of the most eloquent and lyrical dialogues by Plato. Kingsley's life work seems to be to show that the course our civilization took after Plato was in a sense a deviation, both from the Earth, the archetypal forces inhabiting it, and our own deepest nature. He argues a good case in this courageous work.

I will put forward my impression of SOtS, perhaps at the risk of appearing somewhat of a devils advocate. I am of two minds about this book - there can be no doubt about the sincerity of Keeney's experiences, the depth of his insights, or the beauty and magic of the life that he has chosen for himself and that he describes in SOtS. I will leave these to be pointed out by other reviewers. However, beyond the most mundane clich&eacute;s, I see very little connection between Keeney's experiences and psychotherapy as we know it or ecology.In this book Keeney describes his journeys around the world. Perhaps my greatest reservation with this book is that the man is like a butterfly - he constantly flits from one shaman to the next, never learning a tradition or a ceremony, never learning anything, really. His shamanic practice basically consists of a mediumship, where his body/mind is taken over by assorted "spirits", accompanied with shaking, speaking in tongues and total loss of conscious control. This, as one can imagine, can lead to humorous situation in a Native American sweat lodge, one of which Keeney was unceremoniously expelled following his antics, but is received with great affection and respect in different African traditions, including those of the Zulu, Bushmen and African-Americans. The descriptions of his meetings with Bushmen were particularly poignant and beautiful. The downside of mediumship is, I suppose, that one never really learns a technology of working with the alternate reality (whatever it is), or with energy. Moreover, this has nothing to do with psychotherapy, which strives for conscious control (rather, letting go) and understanding of subconscious complexes and contractions. The psychotherapeutic theory in the book is, at best, rather simplistic; K is simply not interested in it. Given his experiences, I can see why.Although Keeney is very good at playing the humility game, he can't help mentioning throughout the book how assorted indigenous people called him "a very holy man, indeed". Heh... yeah! There are many photographs in the book of the medicine people he met and perhaps 70% include the humble holy man Keeney himself.These comments notwithstanding, here is a man with the guts to meet all kinds of interesting people and to talk about his innermost sacred experiences to the whole world. This in itself, I believe, something worthy of respect.

There are a number of cool scenes - such as the one with the goldfish, or the curator playing the late night DVD, or the bench meeting between the curator and the little kid - and the leading actress is exquisite. Unfortunately, this is overshadowed by the general sulleness and moroseness that seep into every corner of the movie. Most of the actors, especally the kids, look perpetually asphyxiated.It seems to me the director was paralyzed by her own sensitivity.an indie allright. a breath of fresh air that lacked oxygen.

"Spiritual materialism is the belief that a certain temporary state of mind is a refuge from suffering. " In other words, for a 'spiritual materialist', a state of mind can exist inherently on its own (i.e., "Ego") apart from the chains of cause and effect that cause suffering. Classical Nagarjuna & Mahayana. Yet this became one of the towering issues for Chogyam Trungpa's Naropa University community, a perfect concept to flog guilt-ridden Westerners with. It basically means "you are not doing it right". It means "your motives are not pure". It means you need a 'real' guru.Unfortunately, the guru in question created a personality cult, parading about in expensive robes (brocade, silk, cashmere) in front of his impoverished hippie audiences while women bodyguards in black dresses and high heels, packing automatic weapons, served him sak&eacute;. Trungpa, having vowed celibacy to his superiors, caroused with female students and nuns, eloped from England with an underage girl, tolerated abuse and exploitation of students by assorted inner circle henchmen while hobnobbing with beatnik superstars and ultimately drank himself into delirium, cirrhotic liver and death. One of his cardinal, and unforgivable, sins is promotion as a successor of Osel Tenzin (aka Thomas Rich) who knowingly passed HIV during unprotected sex to (hundreds?) of his students. Here is the excuse:"... Rich first swore us to secrecy (family secrets again), and then said that Trungpa had requested him to be tested for HIV in the early 1980s and told him to keep quiet about the positive result. Tendzin had asked Trungpa what he should do if students wanted to have sex with him, and Trungpa's reply was that as long as he did his Vajrayana purification practices, it did not matter, because they would not get the disease." Hmmm... "if students wanted to have sex with him..."... Like Rajneesh, the two guys called this debauchery .... "tantra" :) ! Or crazy wisdom. I call it addiction and the epitome of spiritual materialism!How good are Trungpa's words in SM? Does it matter who speaks? Do precepts matter? If a brilliant, highly accomplished tulku who trained at Oxford and at the famous Surmang (Sarmung?!) Kagyu monastery, someone who mastered the intricacies of philosophical-energetic exercises that constitute lojong ("mind training"), falls under the sway of the Ego, what chance do we have, you and me? How does spiritual practice unlock the fundamental goodness in us? Does inventing a new concept help or does it represent yet another way to throw sand into the eyes of unsuspecting Westerners?I believe that 'spiritual materialism', while legitimate and innocuous as a concept in itself, was used as a tool, a not so subtle technique of mind control to instill fear and dependence into Trungpa's cult. This can, in fact, be considered the negative side of satipatthana ("mindfulness"). It is easy for a spiritual teacher entrusted with intimate personal details to take advantage of the disciple by slowly wrapping him/her into a net made of shame and guilt that only the teacher himself can unwrap. To tell the student that their attraction to spirituality is inauthentic and needs to be 'realigned'. I imagine that falling under sway of someone like that is like growing up in an abusive family - perpetuating a fundamental ignorance and lack of integrity which need to be exorcised eventually. The worrisome detail here is that the Tibetan hierarchy, like the Catholic church of today, refused to condemn the wayward tulku despite ample reports about goings-on at Naropa. Sadly, when it comes to spirituality we are on our own, depending on our own moral compass, gut feelings and integrity. I'd suspect that the more one strays from simple ethics-based practices towards the 'energetic' end of the spiritual spectrum, the more dangerous the territory. Anyways, at least one person seems to have escaped with her skin and inner compass intact - Pema Chodron, whom I respect deeply. She to this day refuses to discuss Trungpa's misdeeds which i guess is a credit to her... and him.Psychologically speaking, Trungpa's behavior is easy to understand. We're talking about a young boy, taken away from his mother and family and raised in the highly misogynistic all-male environment of the monastery. Indoctrinated by the belief in the "power of divine incarnation". Tulkus are raised through cognitive dissonance: women are polluting, they are an obstacle to practice, at best women can serve others and at worst they are a nuisance - yet women are also transformed into dakinis, female aspects of being that men must associate with in order to reach enlightenment. Right there is the recipe for abuse, as explained so eloquently by June Campbell. As a semidivine Being, the tulku can do anything he wants. And Trungpa did.This book is worth reading because it represents one of the milestones of Tibetan permeation of the Western spiritual landscape and may have interesting (hypothetical) connections to ideas discussed by Gurdjieff and Castaneda. It also points at a dead end, as "an attempt of an overgrown child to reconstruct for himself a kingdom according to whim" (Marin, 1995). There are/were other, true, beacons of light in the Tibetan community like Tarthang, Mingyur, Chagdud, Tenzin Wangyal and HH Tenzin Gyatso. It is the Who, not What, that matters.

To me, Kandomble represents one of the best ways to experience and share religious feeling - a spiritual path where the entire body celebrates through music, rhythm and trance. Clearly, Byrne has been hooked as well.This DVD represents a collage of images, syncopations, sweaty bodies, images of saints and possessed old ladies, filmed and collated with affection and deep sympathy. At times I thought I glimpsed a sparseness in the spaces between the narrative and the image, a holding back from being swept from holding the camera into the dance frenzy, that sort of reminded me of Werner Herzog. Ile Aiye's narrative is removed out of the ordinary into a place which is neither here nor there. Some might attribute such an approach to lack of concern with craftsmanship, but Byrne pulls it off relatively well. This film makes me want to BE THERE, in Salvador de Bahia, moving together with those bodies that were designed to move and to worship, to celebrate the ecstasy of being filled with the force of life. The words themselves, Oshun, Yemaya, Exu, Xango, Omulu... dance away effortlessly from the tongue...Well worth seeing.

I too had to see the movie after all the hype and nominations. It started kind of funny and the 'wedding sack' thing was entertaining. I was touched by scenes with the prostitute, the little humanity in the film felt like a breath of fresh air. On the whole, however, the slapsticky, crude and insulting stuff simply came to be too much .Cohen is a 'comedian' who makes his living by betraying people's trust and demeaning them; his formula is to scrape the barrel through pandering to the worst instincts in marginalized folks who revel in seeing OTHERS as fools. This, of course, is the last resort of unfunny comedians; actually, Cohen is a jester, rather than a comedian and is probably incapable of creating a genuinely funny, open-hearted and entertaining product.In short, this film belongs to the Jackass genre by having nothing to say and sinking to the lowest common denominator. It cynically masquerades itself as 'a fight against intolerance, racism and ignorance', while in reality representing a textbook example of media opportunism. Basically, it combines pseudo-outrageousness, bad art and lack of acting talent to get two minutes in the limelight for a guy whose claim to fame is that he has no social inhibitions. A waste of money and time.It is, however, an effective excuse for people look for a sanctioned indulgence of crudeness and bad taste. That includes, of course, the Oscar crowd.

Leonard Cohen's music brings together poetry, melody, sensuality and spirit in a way that hasn't been matched by any other performer i know. This movie alludes to the magic of Cohen's work but cannot fully capture it as it focuses most of its time on performers who, while trying hard, fall short of what was asked of them.As a previous reviewer quipped, I'd much prefer to see more of the man and less of the fans. I found myself fidgeting whenever the camera focused on others. Especially the Wainwrights seemed to be all over the place, undeservedly so, IMHO; and Nick Cave was vaguely dissapointing with his Sinatra mannerisms. I liked the piece by Anthony (who I haven't heard of before) and especially the closing performance by Bono and his buddies together with Cohen; it was touching to see the respect these guys have for the old aristocrat.I have a lot of affection for Cohen and was sincerely touched by this movie. The humility, the nobility of character and mind and the sheer power of presence that emanate from Leonard show how a well-spent life looks like.

In this book, Carson, an ex-marine, describes his apprenticeship in Oklahoma's Kiamchis mountains with an old Choctaw "conjure" (medicine woman) named Mary Gardener. The process included a prolonged purification (diet, smudges, tobacco, fasting), ceremonies, vision quests, all of which are fairly typical of NDN medicine practices. Towards the end, he helped Mary treat people afflicted with some of the many diseases encountered by the conjure: spirit -of-war disease, tiny-animals-frolicking-about-in-the-water disease,cloud, feather, little-gray-men-who run-the-world, birdsnake diseases, television sickness and many others. Carson provides a taxonomy of these diseases and their treatments, which i found very interesting. He also learns that each animal can cause its own specific disease which is illustrated by its own specific myth, usually featuring the Choctaw culture hero, Yellow Tobacco Boy. And not only animals: the elements, elementals, plants, stones, spirits - the number of sentient entities and their ability to do harm to an unaware human is, to the conjure, inexhaustible.Carson was not alone in his studies - Mary had apprentices from all over the continent, including New Orleans and Mexico; apparently, in the universe of North American medicine people information flows copiously, if not freely. Apprentices learn about proper protocols for asking help from animals (either in the individual form or from the collective animal spirit) and about behaving impeccably in the face of the unknown. A central theme in the book revolves around the all-important knowledge of the human energy body, or "shilip". Choctaws recognize 22 gradations within the shilip, the viewing and manipulation of which have a central role in the healing process. Shilip is tightly integrated into a complicated cosmology, and this connection in turn is an integral part of the healing process. Once cannot be healed apart from the interconnectedness with the cosmos. The patient/client is seen holistically; a disease, or misfortune, is reflection of a wrong energetic turn in life which the conjure works to right.The arduous training proved to be too much and Carson bailed out. Or lived to write about it :)I found the book interesting and a quick read. The description of healing practices was certainly fascinating, not to mention Carson's sporadic interactions with "paranormal" aspects of conjure's reality. Disconcertingly, however, the book jacket reveals that Carson also authored "medicine cards" through which one can "discover power through the ways of animals". Hmmm... that makes me a bit suspicious. We'll see how it all pans out - i'll definitely be on lookout for more info about Choctaw "conjures."

In my mind, I've always pictured the lead Sigur Ros singer as as attractive female (in an elfish bjorkish kind of way). Well, music does not emit pheromones and I was jolted out of the fantasy to find a falsetto-singing guy (a spiritual Chris Martin-alike). Oh well... :0The 2 DVDs depict a Sigur Ros tour back home. In a nutshell, I experienced them as a simple yet profound work of art that transposes music and its creators onto sparse wildness that is Iceland. How do people eke a living out there, I kept asking myself, watching village people and small townsfolk that seemed like one large family ...fishing? sheepherding? ...banking?The power work of this piece comes from its simplicity and from its intent which was to bring something back home. Together, the musicians create an archetypal energy that touches and inspires that from which we all come from. A process that weaves individual contributions into something larger and ever more beautiful is the quintessentially human inheritance that many of us lost. Something that can be touched by listening that is far away from thought, a mutually generated space of feeling that arises out of silence. Just like land itself. In many ways, the creative method of Sigur Ros reminded me of Andy Goldsworthy, another northerner with an eye -and ear - for the land.The sincerity, lack of pretension and authenticity of the four musicians were heart-warming to this jaded cayotee. Here you have an hour long experience that will stay with you.

This book is about music, healing, indigenous view of life and above all, it is about harmony, which is achieved when life is lived with respect and with generosity.Diallo is a member of the mainly agricultural Minianka/Senufo tribe living in what today is Mali. The Minianka have been able to resist the depredations which occur when Islam or X-ianity enters African societies; they are animist, that is, they still observe and follow ancient laws that emphsize the interdependence between humans, nature and the transcendent realms. Music to the Minianka music is much more than entertainment. It is used for work, celebration, ritual, inititations, funerals and healing; each activity (as well as each profession and each person) has its own special rhythms and harmonies. The MInianka understand music as a bridge between the visible and invisible. As such, it is used to establish harmonious relationships between an individual, his community, his ancestors and the Creator. Every night there is dancing at the village square - and EVERYBODY dances. Minianka musicians learn to transpose the essence of their fellow men's characters into music, so that when a villager gets to dance, he is greated by rhythms which match his/her character and emotional configuration. By observing closely, the musicians can adapt the music to the needs of the listener and thereby lead them to health. In Minianka villages, says Diallo, "musicians are healers, the healers musicians.... Music...amplifies to our sense the unheard tones and unseen waves that weave together the matter of existence. The beat, the rhythm, the timing, the orchestration, the flow, the balance between action and rest must all be within well-defined limits...and the music becomes a healing art that helps restore emotionally and psychologically disturbed people to harmonious human functioning. "THe book is well written and brings us a close -up of Fienso, the village of Diallo's childhood. I found the descriptions of initiation ceremonies, daily work, secret societies very interesting. It made me see the Minianka society as an extremely sophisticated - where there is place for everyone and where everybody is interconnected in a web of mutual obligations between people, spirits and God. Unfortunately, the interdependence on mutual obligations makes the African society also fragile; when reciprocity inherent in such webs is interrupted, as during incursions of oil and diamond money, radical X-ianity or Islam, the African society collapses and we get what we see today in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Liberia or Sudan - lack of harmony and lack of peace.Still, we would be fools to pass the opportunity to learn what Africans have to teach us. Music is one of the keys that can open the door of the gilded cage in which the giant of industrial nihilism has imprisoned us and Yaya Diallo shows us in this wonderful book, that it is possible to open one's body, spirit and destiny to the amazing world of harmony and beauty where true healing occurs.

David Gergen is the CNN face which can always be relied on to make a snide remark about Obama and his team. He was an aparatchik in Nixon, Ford and Clinton administrations and in this book lays out his experiences with the 4 presidents. We also hear about Carter - always in a patronizing, haughty tone that seems rather unfair in the light of the disastrous Reagan years that followed.It may be hard to believe today but once upon a time GOP politicians had progressive notions on health care, economy, desegregation, environmental protection, Native American rights and international politics. Nixon's policies in particular were often ahead of their time. Thanks to him, emissions of lead and CFCs have declined (by 98%); sewage treatment was upgraded for hundreds of millions of Americans and Native Americans received long awaited protection. Nixon, an astute student of politics and leadership, competently dealt with the Russians, Chinese and Europeans but also had a dark side. Gergen does a good job describing Nixon's inability to bring a moral framework to politics. We see an autocratic (vicious) person who despised the democratic process, refused accountability and was haunted by paranoid fears. There were shady deals and operations aimed at "destroying" unliked political "enemies" and media personalities. Like Breitbart's agent provocateurs of today, Nixon's people established fake 'leftist' organizations to compromise Democrats,etc.The chapter on Reagan is obsequious to the point of ridiculousness. Reagan is the guy who told us that "trees emit more pollution than cars." Who, with enthusiastic support of Alan Greenspan, bankrupted the country by engineering the greatest transfer of wealth from middle classes to the rich in the history of the world. The country paid for the military buildup by increasing the deficit from 2 to 6%, and by neglecting to build schools, roads, bridges and invest in health care. To achieve this, Reagan lied habitually: about the Panama canal, about Grenada, about Nicargaua, about Soviet 'military buildup'. There was the Beirut disaster. The SDI debacle. The appointment of dangerous yet incompetent wingnuts (Pipes, Nitze, Casey) into key positions. Gergen overlooks all this because he is impressed by the PR, manipulation skills and ole boy mannerisms of a "great communicator" who had an uncanny, some might say eerie, ability to muddy the waters and people's minds through folksy stories. I say eerie, because one often has the feeling of a lack of humaneness, of an odd detachment, a sense that there was "nobody home". Gergen ascribes this weird aspect of the Reagan persona to "intense privateness". I doubt that. I think there really was nobody home.If one would have to choose the one man most responsible for the decline in fortunes of the American middle class, it would be Reagan. Rabid deregulation, religiosity, increased wealth disparity, decreased opportunities for the middle class, tax cuts for the rich, rise of the defense industrial complex, aggressive militarism, enormous deficits - can all be put at his doorstep. Was he a good leader? Really? This is what Tip O'Neill, the ultimate bipartisan negotiator, had to say: "Reagan...only works three and a half hours a day. He doesn't do his homework. He doesn;t read his briefing papers. It's sinful that this man is the President of the United States. He lacks the knowledge that he should have, on every sphere, whether it's the domestic or whether it's the international sphere."The most interesting section is on Clinton. Bill's personal qualities, qualifications (and lack thereof), co-dependent relationships with Hillary and Al, political and emotional quirks and shortcomings are depicted in fascinating detail. Clinton was probably one of the smartest US Presidents ever, and was able to miraculously stem the economic decline inherited from the Republicans while making a few shady deals with the Wall Street (such as the infamous repeal of the Glass-Steagall, which engineered the Rise of the Vampire Squids). Clinton's success reflects his ability to become immersed into complex issues, together with an encyclopedic knowledge & photographic memory. Consequently, the man can extract the best elements from multiple perspectives - which is how he outmaneuvered Gingrich. Gergen presents us with a lucid analysis of the healthcare debacle but does not talk about Clinton's failures that still reverberate today. With his pal Rubin, Clinton deregulated the banking industry leading to obscene bonuses, M&As;, raiding of taxpayer resources by banks, mortgage companies and private equity firms. By cutting deals with the Chinese and Indians he exported well paying US jobs into China (manufacturing) and India (IT). Etc.Paradoxically, Nixon and Carter will go into history as the last American presidents who gave a damn about the middle class by refusing to be cowed by banking, oil, agribusiness and defense industry lobbyists. Obviously, this does not make it into Gergen's narrative . Thus, this is an uneven book. Gergen obviously timed its publication to ingratiate himself with the voodoo economics crowd. The publication coincided with the rise of a primitive GOP faction (led by neocons and oil companies) which proceeded to enrich itself and impoverish the taxpayer through interminable wars and economic collapse. Rove will always see Gergen as an ex-Clintonista (and a decent person, which is an anathema in contemporary Republicanism). This book shows that Gergen preserved his personal integrity and this is ultimately what counts.

I've had this camera for a couple of months now; it has performed flawlessly under a variety of conditions. I've been able to get good shots at night, at dawn, under dense forrest canopies and in the bright sunlight of the altiplano. Also, the camera captured great shots from moving buses or cars.I found SD700 to be an excellent pocket camera and with extra memory and a spare battery one can go on using it for a long time.The only potential issue for me is the sensitivity of the LCD screen. I'd recommend using a screen protector for shots on-the-fly, and a carrying case is a must.

This is an attempt to address an interesting socio-spiritual phenomenon that raised its rainbow head in the late 60ies - Carlos Castaneda's 'Yaqui mysticism' and use of hallucinogenics as an aid to spiritual growth. Fikes claims that Castaneda, together with a couple of other UCLA antropologists (Barbara Myerhoff and Peter Furst) unscrupulously took advantage of the yearning in the popular culture by basically delivering a product designed to sell.One of the main claims in the book is that Castaneda's Yaqui sorcerer was mirrored on Ramos Medina-Silva, a Huichol would-be shaman; secondly, Fikes believes that anthropologists studying Huichols in the 50-60ies misrepresented H. culture and Huichol shamanism in order to fill in the gaps created by Castaneda books. However, the fact that Furst and Myerhoff refused to share field notes with Fikes is not especially surprising, given Fikes' obsessiveness, belligerence and misanthropy exhibited on the pages of "Academic Opportunism". Specifically, his contention that Castaneda modeled his don Juan upon Medina Silva appears spurious and contrived. Much is made of the information that Castaneda (along with dozens of other anthropologists) met Medina-Silva, yet there is little evidence for (and lots of evidence against) the idea that Huichols were any inspiration for Castaneda at all. Well, we don;t even know if it was Carlos who wrote those books in the first place.Fikes' book has other weaknesses. First, it is badly written. There is little editing - the same two points are recycled over and over, literally dozens of times, sometimes even with same wording. Personal attacks on Furst and Myerhoff become, to someone not involved in the controversy, wearisome. Not only has Fikes' personal vendetta overshadowed an interesting conundrum involving CCs oeuvre... it also sparked an academic equivalent of a shamanic fight, which Fikes lost. As a result, he became virtually unemployable in the US and now teaches English in Istanbul.I suppose this is in part because of the inadequacies in this book. Unlike Furst and Myerhoff, who spent decades with Huichols and other Indian tribes and had extensive familiarity with the peyote cult, Fikes himself only spent 15 months in the field. He is an amateur. His treatment of Castaneda is cavalier, as Fikes shows no familiarity with, or interest in, Peruvian shamanism or proto-Aztec nagualism that seem to have influenced Castanedas work. There are no references to Northern Coastal or Qero curanderism, folk nagualism beliefs and witchcraft, Zapotec/Mixtec/Mayan beliefs etc. Although Fikes mentions 'wolf nahualism' among the Huichols, he shows no inclination to study it, even though this aspect of Huichol shamanism may be the most relevant to his central thesis. I don't know if I am more disturbed by Fikes' disregard for scholarship, his pigheaded agressiveness or his lack of self-reflection.In short, this work is not about scholarship but rather about Fikes personal gripes about his fellow academics. As such, it may hold some interest to people interested in revisiting Castaneda and the sixties.

Harris was a Times correspondent from the 1900s Morocco who witnessed the tumultuous transition from quasi-independent sultanate to French occupation. Yet he was also much more - an insider with access to the court and the sultan, someone who could move with relative freedom across the country occupied by a rapacious government, semi-independent Berber tribes, prosperous Jews who were mostly left to live their lives, assorted bandits and Italian, Spanish and German spies. Morocco was a strategic pawn in the maneuvering between European powers; Harris documents with tragic precision how Europeans manipulated the hapless well-meaning but weak sultan Mulai Abdul Aziz with gimmicks, tricks and toys. The country was held together by force represented by sultan's army and sultan himself - capricious, unfair, childlike, brutal, controlled by a scheming vizier yet, in a weird way, innocent. Everyone was out to deceive him and suck him dry, so sultan used Harris as (perhaps his only trustworthy) adviser for politics, etiquette, European gadgetry and fun. Harris, after all, was a pukka sahib in the best possible sense of that designation, with an unflappable confidence and courage of the English gentleman (they don't make'em anymore).There are priceless descriptions of the country and its people. Audiences with the sultan, sumptuous meals, court intrigues. Harris has much affection for the country even as he documents the cruelty, avarice, brutality, naivete, sufferings - but also generosity and expansiveness of its people. Then, as today, walking the corridors of the casbah meant every man for himself. In Harris' view, the French brought sorely needed stability to the country, together with the security and prosperity to the middle classes of Morocco. One can see the legacy of the French today in the roads, the language and bureaucracy.The book is often light-hearted and funny. It's also sad even a bit incredulous when describing the sufferings of the people at the hands of the powerful. Above all, it provides a priceless glimpse in a world that was. If you are contemplating a visit - read this book.

In this book one gets a series of exercises which guide one to accomplish such tasks as &quot;finding one's power animal&quot;, &quot;spirit extraction&quot; and so on. TWS has a lot to recommend it and since the good stuff has been pointed out in other reviews, i myself will ignore it here. Harner has, almost single handedly, ushered in the era of &quot;neo-shamanism&quot;. As i understand it, the basic idea behind neoshamism is to find a way to enter the &quot;altered state of consciousness (ASC)&quot; without having to use medicine plants. These plants are illegal, may be diffult to prepare correctly and are altogether too unpleasant to deal with. So, in comes the drum. And the rattle. The premise is that, somehow, using the same utensils as, say, Siberian shamans, one is going to enter the same ASC. Nothing could be further from truth. In the absence of the mythological and spiritual context, the neoshamanic drums and rattles are toys for children.The &quot;shamanic&quot; methods described in TWS were developed by Harner 30 years ago and have not changed one iota since then. All his imagination, creativity and inspiration seems to have vanished into thin air once he left UC Berkeley and now this guy keeps selling the same old stuff decade after decade. Academically! Seriously! Businesslike! TWS is Harner's Nicean Council - it has frozen his tracks.The Way of Shaman gives us an aseptic, soul-less and (for me) ultimately boring way into the spirit world. Well, what *is* a shaman anyway? Is the mestizo in Iquitous peddling his ayahuasca a shaman? Is someone who finished her coursework at &quot;The Foundation for Shamanic Studies&quot; a shaman? For me, a shaman is someone whose task is to care for Life and whose role is to connect individual strands of consciousness to the large, universal and delicious Life consciousness. A good shaman is aware of the great Mystery and of the fact, that we are just players in it and why not go for the ride for the beauty of it. The (traditional) shaman is also plugged into the spiritual and mythic universe of his/her society and therefore connected to this mystery. We have lost this connection and are looking for it - (neo)shamanism, if it is to survive, will have to provide it somehow, somewhere. Right now, i think it is failing - one traditional Lakota lodge is worth ten courses taken at the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. In order to find one's power animal in the traditional society one does not just lie on the floo and daydream with the drum. Usually, much legwork is done and a lot of sweat/tears are shed; it can be dangereous and it takes a lot of patience, courage and ingenuity - all qualities necessary for serious work in ASC. One brings in the ancestors and the spirit world with reverence and respect. Harner ignores all this (most important stuff) and this is why this book is ultimately unsatisfying.

Pagel's main thesis is so simple and self-evident that this reader experienced a dissonant moment when he realized that it lays out a view that is diametrically opposite from the fables believed by most contemporary "Christians." According to Pagels, the main message of original Christian teachings was that of freedom from oppressive psychic complexes projected upon Graeco-Roman divinities and, for Jews, a reformulation of the autocratic jealous Yahweh war-deity. Christians discovered that contemplative practices, personal discovery and growth lead towards establishing a personal relationship to the divine. This was of course anathema to Roman and Jewish societies, for which religion was a dominant instrument of social-political control. By turning within, Christians have in effect secularized the power of social and political obligations within Jewish & Roman societies; turning without, they rejected the gilded ceremony and pomp that bestowed divinity onto deeply flawed people such as Nero, Caligula, Commodus and the anxious philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius who, for all his brilliance, missed the new world paradigm.Take sex. For Greeks and Romans, sex had no moral and ethical connotations - homosexual relationships between friends, students & mentors etc were normal; so was prostitution,abortions etc; abducted children were first trained and then sold as sex slaves with no questions asked. Jews had a different view - rather than serving enjoyment, the function of sex was procreation of the race, fulfilling the neolithic injunction to "increase and multiply" so as to "fill the earth". Polygamy, divorce were acceptable to ancient Jews as long as they resulted in progeny. In the words of rabbi Hillel, a Jew could divorce his wife "for any reason he chooses, even if she burns his soup" , for example "if he finds a younger woman more beautiful than his wife." Then comes Jesus and condemns homosexuality, polygamy, divorce, states that spiritually, there are no differences between rich and poor and talks about such unheard-of things as love between man and his wife. For Jesus, marriage itself is divine and the link between the partners is spiritual, "made in Heaven." This at the time when, i believe Greeks did not even have a word for "love" ('agape' could denote feelings for a good meal, for example) . Reading the book one might conclude that Christianity upended a world that today might be seen as both archaic and spiritually degenerate. It brought a new discourse, ethics and morality that were embedded in a new vision of self.Early followers of Jesus were saying things like this:"...all people are begotten alike, with a capacity and ability for reasoning and emotion, without preference to age, sex or social status. Nor do they gain wisdom by fortune, but have it implanted in them by nature....for intelligence is not given the wealth, nor is it acquired by study but is begotten with the very formation of the mind." (P.. 52). This was, almost word by word, repeated two thousand years later: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal....".This freedom talk changed after Constantine's edicts and Nicea. Christianity becomes a state religion and churches are showered with gifts, land, money, prestige. Perhaps not too surprisingly, the religious message morphs into stressing obedience to authority rather than freedom of the will or an innate human dignity. Church "fathers" like Augustine begin to emphasize humanity's enslavement to sin. Humans are sick, suffering and helpless, irreparably damaged by the fall [here is where the serpent comes in]. "Every human ever conceived by semen is contaminated by original sin", sez Augustine, and "slavery...[is] ...planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance." It's almost as if antichrist took over as soon as there was the power shift and pontifex maximus became the canniest Vatican operator whose chief interest was in exercising worldly power. Beatification of Wojtyla is the perfect example of how clueless contemporary catholics are about Jesus' teachings.In summary, Pagels (yet again) shows that early Christianity was a complex, multifaceted process that represented a radical challenge for the ancient world and that brought a new vision that reverberates to this day. The parable of Adam, Eve and the Serpent was used by different strands of the Xian universe to justify their (often contradictory and mutually exclusive) views of human relationship to the divine. The teachings of Jesus of Nazareth were often adapted (or rather, perverted) by "Catholics" and later by Protestants and evangelicals to fit the political order of the day. Unfortunately, the doctrine that won the day was that of Augustine who, by allowing people to pin blame for their behavior on 'original sin' effectively absolved them from guilt and responsibility for their actions. Profound insights about the nature of personhood, suffering and inner freedom that resembled Buddhist views and were championed by some Gnostics (such as Valentinus) were abandoned in order to justify the relentless pursuit of material wealth and worldly power that epitomizes the modern Catholic Church. Many evangelicals and Jews now use the Bible to justify greed, glorify wealth, potentiate social stratification and to support the habit of making money for its own sake while forsaking their duties to the community. While refusing to pay their fair share of taxes, cutting welfare and supporting war and ethnic cleansing in , amongst other places, Palestine itself. It would seem that the message of Jesus of Nazareth still resonates today. Pagels' book has been timely and a propos. There is a need to purge the temple of idolaters, merchants, hoaxers and fake believers.

Having heard of Ruiz from several acquantainces I picked up the 4 Agreements and Beyond Fear looking forward to learning something about the Toltecs. First of all, one notices a revisionist streak with respect to history as we know it: the Toltecs who built Teotihuacan were an aggressive militaristic culture, far from the peace-loving sages portrayed by Ruiz. So who are his "Toltecs"? I must confess I have been disappointed by the "shamanic wisdom" dispensed with by Ruiz. It looks to me that this guy combines simple common sense ("be impeccable with your word"; "don't take anything for granted" etc.) with terminology filched from Castaneda (stalking, luminous egg, assemblage point, second awareness etc) and spices it up with a New Agey dose of guru worship. Apparently, the impeccability and a loving heart did not prevent Ruiz from snagging his new partner Gaya from a happy marriage of 25 years; the mumbo jumbo of soul- mating going back for 13+ generations made me uneasy with the whole work.To me it seems the book's aim is to make Ruiz look like a guru. If he's a guru, who are his gurus? What are Ruiz's influences? Clearly, Zacharia Sitchin with his extraterrestrials is a huge presence; then of course Castaneda, maybe Blavatsky who one might expect a cultured Mexican to be familiar with. Who are Ruiz's teachers? Who made a "nagual" out of him? Apart from his grandmother, there seems to be nobody. Ruiz's insights mainly come from "visions" obtained during journeying amidst the ruins of Teotihuacan. This is where he got all the (specific!) information about, say, Atlantis, Lemuria, and other similar and beloved fables of old.I think Ruiz has reached the pinnacle of new age shamanism. In this book we get a synthesis of his endeavours, that is, a skillful package offering exactly what a contemporary seeker for ancient ways might be looking for. For me it was unsatisfying and unconvincing. My recommendation would be to read Jamie Sams.

Have you ever left the massage table with a clear head and lots of energy? Damasio thinks he knows why. His idea is that the mind cannot be conceived without some sort of embodiment (hence Descartes' Error). There is no Self which gives rise to a unified Mind; instead there are just so many synchronized systems of the body (the visceral, musculo-skeletal etc.) whose combined output results in a background &quot;feeling&quot;. It is that feeling which represents the self ; self can therefore also be defined as a continuous experience of the body. During massage we relax the mind by relaxing the body .According to Damasio, each movement (of the limbs or bowels) results in a specific &quot;feeling&quot; loaded into our subconsciousness. These feelings and associated emotions are at the very core of cognition. Indeed, this book is intended to prove to the lay public Damasio's belief that he has experimentally deconstructed the wittgensteinian/russelian illusion (which claims that formal logic will get us to the best available solution for any problem). On the contrary, D. found that certain patients whose emotional centers are disabled by stroke but whose logical abilities remain intact become functional invalides: they cannot decide and when they do, they tend to make wrong decisions (they cannot use their &quot;gut feelings&quot; and therefore end duped or easily misled). The integration of emotions and reasoning is orchestrated by the prefrontal cortex and a large part of the book is devoted to explaining the specific neural circuits dedicated to this task.In my opinion, D. has not been able to prove Descartes was wrong. It is obvious that our minds depend on (internal and external) sensory input to generate &quot;representations&quot; which ultimately result in &quot;decision-making&quot;; however, Plato would say that an absence of a functional brain region does not necesarily disprove the existence of the Self - it merely prevents that Self from expressing itself.The book has interesting and important things to say. I think, however, that it will be of limited use to an average reader. I often found it to be unnecessarily technical; moreover, unlike, say, Ramachandran's book, which is a veritable explosion of provoking ideas and speculations, Desartes' Error is basically about one single idea... as a result, the same thing is repeated over and over again and i had to clench my canines to maintain interest. It would definitely benefit from good editing.

This is a superficial and at times naive account by a yet another starry eyed, eager and willing "shaman's apprentice". Elizabeth Jenkins worked as an English teacher in Cuzco when she met a "fourth level" shaman, Juan Nunez, who showed her around Peru. Juan immediately initiated her into the fourth level herself. The apparent ease and efficiency of this "initiation" process has, if i am allowed to be slightly cynical, allowed Elizabeth and Juan to create a major business catering to those who are looking to get something for nothing. About 20 times a year, Juan initiates yet another group of wide eyed tourists, and both E. and J. lead initiation workshops all over the world, including the US.This book will be of interest to people who are inclined towards safe "spiritual adventures". I would not recommend it to people who are looking for more resources on shamanic "technology", initiation or peruvian beliefs.

"I wonder sometimes why you help me like this, when we're not related.", said Tom Harmer to his Salish mentor Clayton Woods. "I like you", replied Clayton. "You like they say, down to earth. Love our mother. Why not you instead of them `apples' runing around the tribal center, think they're in charge?" The contempt in Clayton' voice was not disguised.A new breed of Indian activists has arisen lately - fiercely promoting Indianesness through academia, internet and politics. These people are counting drops of Indian blood while running casinos and the Indian/Chicano `authenticity' racket, a lucrative business based on helping assuage white guilt over the injustices perpetrated over the years. But in reality, they are just pretend-Indians.Old style medicine people have no patience with these pretenders. Clayton despised the acculturated tribal office workers who aproached him with tobacco, calling on distant kinship ties to solicit his support, while flaunting their Native identity. These Indians behaved like White men, with brassyy, garrulous voices promoting the new plan to develop a huge molybdenum mine on Colville land. "They come out here [in the wilderness] and pretend", said Clayton. "Then they go back, wear it like a big reputation. They just showing off. They want to be the boss.""Being an Indian not about the color of your skin or how much Indian blood you got. It about what in your heart. That old-time way, we say, en'hwl'tils, want to live. To have that want to be here. I see you walk over the earth. You want this thing you are. You want to live."This is an absolutely wonderful book. Together with the sequel "Living in Full Awareness of the Earth" it is one of the few books that are an essential reading for anyone who isn't interested in theory, or philosophy, or religion of Native Americans, but in learning about the reverence, practicalness, and the unyielding sense of truth with which people who have never been apart from their natural environment, approach life., This are no pretend-Indians here that one meets in Castaneda's books, nor self-interested political activism of a Vine Deloria. Ultimately, Harmer writes about re-learning what is real, about what really maters. About awaraness that does not recognize the artificial boundary of Indians vs non-Indians promulgated by pseudo-Indian pretenders in NAFSP. Harmer was fortunate in being able to meet a real traditional medicine person, just as we are fortunate today to be able to participate in their meeting through his books.Harmer writes about the land, animals, spirits, traditional ceremonies, the beauty and mystery of nature, about living with dignity and humor. Cannot recommend his books highly enough.

This is music from El Andalus at its best. Gharnati, which can be translated as &quot;music from Granada&quot; is filled with sensual longing and old memories; through Amina's voice the old ghosts take place here in this world with dignity and grace. Amina herself is rather amazing - she has degrees in philosophy, philology and dance and her spiritual beauty and wisdom show themselves in her voice and in this sublime album. Highly recommended.

I couldn't bring myself to like this movie. While the acting was pretty good, the directing IMO was overambitious and the script atrocious - full of holes, unconnected story lines and just plain static. While some people might call this art, to me it looks more like incompetence. In any case, the film is a project no one could salvage from well-deserved obscurity.The plot line is cliche-y, good ol' conspiracy genre mixing corrupt Saudis, ruthless corporate executives and cabals formed by US Judiciary, State, CIA, large law firms and large corporations... working together to derail a well-meaning pretender to the 'Saudi' throne... throw in the Hezbollah, naive Pakistanis brainwashed into terrorists, expat financial advisors (Matt Damon) working to help the renegade prince and a seasoned CIA Mid-East operative (Clooney) made into a scapegoat after a botched assassination, and you get a collage of same-looking faces, roles, scenes and story lines that is all but undecipherable.There is a sort of coming together at the end, but it is a whimper rather than a finale, nothing gets resolved and it all falls flat. For heaven's sake, we all know that most everyone associated with the oil business is corrupt, its part of the business model. We know there is a rat race out there, and that the world is dog-eat-dog. Yet reason many of us watch films is because we want to see good craftmanship, vision and inspiration, not to find our political opinions confirmed. I'd say this film fails miserably in making the viewer care about its characters, about the Middle East, its realities and its problems.

There is no question that Gibson's film is a stunning success interms of re-visioning the Maya universe at the time of the Spanish conquest. Everything, from the hunting gear of the forest hunters to the amazing city, its decor, inhabitants, rituals was meticulously researched and impeccably enacted. One exception was the depiction of the Maya ritual chief ( cruel and opportunistic) and the ritual priest (insanely incoherent). In reality, the sacrifice 'theology' rested on an excruciatingly elaborate and sophisticated paradigm devoted to 'saving Time' and 'Universe' ; showing the 'rational' behind the impulse to sacrifice innocent humans would probably be taking a step too far for the functionally illiterate audiences of today.I particularly welcome Gibson's decision to conduct the entire film in Maya, which adds a new, and powerful, dimension. It is unlikely that real-world protagonists would have understood each other as Maya have a number of different not always mutually intelligible dialects (Tzotzil, Tzutujil, etc) and subdialects. BTW, the name of the protagonist 'Jaguar Paw' was borrowed from a real warlord who ruled the city of Tikal in the 4th century (and whose dynasty came, if i am not mistaken, from Teotihuacan or Tula).The purpose of the film, or the idea(s) behind it are not very clear to me. Gibson's film relentlessly pounds the spectator with physical violence, activating the nihilistic, opportunistic and fear-based circuits in our brain. What's the point here - after all, we can see this stuff daily on all news channels. Does Gibson want to show us that there is a bodily (gory) side to human violence forgotten by Western couch potatos? Or is he himself compelled to keep repeating the same motif over and over again in each film he makes, like a mouse running a wheel in its cage. Perhaps Mel is telling us that he can smell the decline of our civilization, like the Maya (and especially the Aztecs) have half a millenium ago? The story of Jaguar Paw is a non-story: a guy is captured and runs away, wreaking vengeance on his tormentors... There is nothing particularly apocalyptic about it: the same violence is going on today with the janjaweed killing and enslaving the Dinka in Darfur; a few years ago Serbs were murdering Bosnians in the heart of the supposedly 'civilized' Europe and British and US airmen were slaughtering hundreds of thousands of hapless Iraqis in the First Gulf War. What goes on in the mind of a suicide bomber who blows himself up in a cafe full of teenagers? I suppose Gibson wants to ask whether we indeed are that different from the post-classical Maya? The suicide bomber is 'defending' his religion, just as the Israeli pilot who bombs Lebanese civilians 'defends' his country, and Aztec and Maya sacrifices were 'defending' their Time. As the 'Fifth Sun' era revolves to its close, are we doomed to repeating the same old patterns, just as Gibson is compelled to make the same film again and again.If there was a positive note in the film, it was in touching a longing that lodges in the hearts of all humans: a longing for living in nature, within a close-knit tribe led by wise elders, experienced hunter leaders, raucous comrads and beautiful women, and the humor that comes from living together in agroup without being separated by walls, real or conceptual. Few other filmmakers have had the courage, insight or vision to come remotely close to this longing.In other words, this film is worth seeing.

This is a book that, in my opinion, cannot be praised enough. It is simple yet profound and the writing reflects the unassuming dignity of a master who is actually trying to teach what we, students, need the most. This is one of the few books i keep near me all the time and it has been a sustained, and never ending, source of inspiration.The basic approach is to teach how to relax, disidentify and feel into awareness of the body, mind and eventually, into the open space where everything is possible. Awareness is an acquired taste. Rinpoche guides the reader towards it from several different angles and with an exquisite understanding of the Western mind and its wiles. Above all, he is appealing to the open, generous heart. A priceless book.

This is a subversive book, as subversive as they get. Tom Robbins managed to put into it all that matters: mushrooms, Tarot, Dogons, dolphins,the Nature of Reality, Sirius B, God, as well as the mysterious amphibian human ancestors, the Nommo which are supposed to be in a telepathic contact with the human race. Written with the metaphorical bravura and wit that have become Robbins' trademarks, the book follows Gwen, a wannabe bookie at a Seattle brokerage house as she grapples with a series of unforeseeable events which include a market crash, a kleptomaniac monkey, a Van Gogh loving Native American, rectal enema and Larry, a recent graduate from the Timbuktu University. Tim is a master of the art of "living on the Pad". While his book is consistently funny and has a couple of excellent sex scenes, the characters, the plot and the style of writing are rather similar to other R. books. The female protagonist is spunky, sexy, nave and lacking something that only the male protagonist can provide: spiritual guidance. Despite all the joking (which I enjoyed), the undertone of HAFP is essentialy moralistic . Larry Diamond (whom I suspect to be a Robbins Doppelganger of sorts), is especially tedious with his endless sermons and unfunny misogynic quips. Nevertheless, the message when taken out of its pajamas is positive: it is about taking risks, listening to the Great Mystery and en-joying oneself.

I've recently missed my plane in Denver - this having been the last flight of the evening, I was sentenced to spend the night at the airport. Scouting the airport bookstore I bumped into the Songbook and snapped it from the shelf. It was a great choice.This book is about Hornby's passion for music. Sitting there, at the airport, reading about his son and music, I could feel my heart beat, my throat getting tighter, a little pressure in the back of my eye. It was sad and also strangely inspiring. Yet he also knows how to make you laugh. "Would it be possible to make love to the tune of 'Let's Get It On'?", he asks.I am genuinely grateful to Nick for singling several songs/bands I did not appreciate before - especially Aimee Mann and R. Wainwright.Some things I don't get. 'Thunder Road, for example. Rod Stewart. The J. Geils Band. Marah (cool but mediocre). A. Di Franco (another pissed off woman). Zimmerman, for all his poetic brilliance.... yet even in our disagreements, I find Hornby's affection for these artists and his passion for their creations, inspiring. Unlike me, the man knows how to always find something positive to say, and I liked this as well.For all his populism Hornby can be elegant when he so chooses. This is what he writes about Nick Cave's "No More Shall We Part: "[this album]..., like so much of Nick Cave's work, is sometimes as unwilling to please and as demanding of your attention as a small child. And yet this may explain why it is such a relief to enter its airless, occasionally overwrought world. In a time when even the angriest, most intimidating hip-hop or heavy metal seems designed to sell us something - a movie or a wrestling match or a lifestyle - Cave's music doesn't seem remotely interested in selling anything. That is to say, it's music made by an artist, in the old-fashioned, twentieth-century sense of the word."Can this be said more elegantly? More generously? With more respect? I don;t think so. Thanks, Nick.

There were a few things Carlos forgot to ask for on that hilltop before leaving his detested Caxamalca: he asked for money, fortune, fame, beautiful chickas and power. What he forgot to ask for were love, humility, peace and God. Amy Wallace shows us in this book that this was a terrible bargain to make.She shows us a Castaneda who was authoritarian, manipulative, paranoid and infantile; the pudgy little man exhibited the worst traits of an insecure macho, including posturing, jealousy, racism and lechery. It was perhaps a terrible inevitability that made the 65 year old cabron pick Amy, the daughter of a well-known writer (and a talented writer in her own right) for one of his victims. Amy shows us how C kept a harem of women cajoled and intimidated into providing sexual favors in the worst tradition of guru-xploitation. The way he got them into his bed was pathetic. [ "Amy", he whispered (to the 25 year-old Amy Wallace). Suddenly, he was more solemn than I'd ever seen him. "You have to give your poto to the nagual. For magical purposes we must have a "close encounter." It's the only way left to us. The hole between a woman's legs is magic and when the nagual leaves his juice inside it goes directly to her brain...it's the fastest way." (p. 81)]. For all the obsession Castaneda had with sex one does not have an impression Castaneda actually ENJOYED intimacy. Intimacy, love, caring were, well, all too human ("ape-like").What made me sad and profoundly angry was reading about C's efforts to deprive his "disciples" and "lovers" of their essence, of who they truly were; only then would he feel comfortable, in control. The man made them break all contact with their families and friends -even destroy the photographs depicting their "previous" selves; Amy was ordered to get rid of her beloved cats. When he had his women isolated, he started with emotional abuse and sexual melodrama.The man is described as a classical psychopath. "I confessed", wrote Castaneda in one of his books, "that I have never respected or liked anybody, not even myself, and that I had always felt I was inherently evil." As de Mille said: "Carlos cannot open his gap and let his passion flow into another person. He cannot commit himself to anything but the separate reality, first in his mind, then on paper....Telling stories excites him but only displays his power to fill up the social world with cobwebs." Wallace shows us the profile of an old child, a congenital liar, who felt helpless and deeply afraid of women and female power, just as he was afraid of life and love. Not surprisingly, the man's fears of women, sex and love creep up in his books. Castaneda had grown callous to pain and sadness and incapable of seeing anyone else's right to freedom but his own.Amy's book also begs the question about whether the stuff Carlos wrote about was real or not. One of Castaneda's prime talents was to find, select, transform, marshall, and present other people's ideas as his own without letting the sources show. The experiences of "Carlos" may then well be true. As is this book. Wallace's journey is a Tale of true Power: power to survive vile spiritual assaults with grace and with love. She shows us how dehumanizing the control of one human being over another can be for everyone involved and how this has destroyed the creator of Don Juan. There can be no compromise when it comes to freedom and truth. gracias, Amy.

"Seek truth and beauty together; you will never find them apart."PythagorasThe books starts with an excellent introduction into Pythagorean ideas about "The One", musical, aesthetic and mathematical theories, education and their view of the Soul. There are long chapters by neoplatonists (Iamblichus, Diogenes Laertius, etc) and rare texts by P. contemporaries Philolaus and Archytas. Most of the texts are by authors writing hundreds of years after Pythagoras' death, including epigrams, sayings and texts by Plato, Aristotle and Church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria and Lactantius. The book is as comprehensive as it can be.Pythagoras was essentially a midwife of our civilization, establishing the discourse that was continued by his disciples such as Empedocles, Parmenides and even Plato. Honoring the Muses, loving music, the art of friendship are, for a Pythagorean, the fundamental aspects of a life worth living. In Pythagorean universe there is no separation between science, cosmology and human spirit, nor was there a cleft between physics and metaphysics that appeared later with Aristotle and the Rennaissance. Pythagoras school raised some of the most enlightened, effective and impressive politicians and philosophers of the period, including Parmenides. Intellect's ability to know Truth depends on the soul's ability to draw from its own innate Goodness. Desires lead us to misery and loneliness.I was struck by the many similarities to Buddhist ideas which were developing at about the same time (5th century BC).In a nutshell, I found the book illuminating and inspiring.

This is a good introduction to NA 'shamanic' cultures. The book is divided into 7 chapters, devoted to semi- geographic groups with similar social organizations and spiritual practices, including the Eskimo, Subarctic, Northwest Coast, Southwest, Californian and Plains Indians. There is a lot of information in each chapter yet the info is condensed in an interesting manner for the lay reader. Included are a number of cool stories and anecdotes. In my opinion, Hunt achieves a good balance between the illustrations and the text... the depicted photos of ritual paraphernalia, shamans, landscape tell the story almost by themselves.I recommend this book as a starting point for people who want to learn about the diversity of NA shamanic practices and beliefs practiced across different cultural, language, ethnic and geographical divisions. As expected from a book intended for a general audience, author presents his information as hard facts. I am sure experts might quibble about some of them; however, this does not detract from the usefullnes of the book.

Bates uses Carlos Castaneda's technique consisting of a dialogue between an all-knowing teacher and an ignorant disciple (a young Christian monk)to convey beliefs from the wild region between the Welsh and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (~7-8th century AD). He calls these practices 'wyrd': "that which turns out, that which comes to pass". Another commonly used synonym would be 'Indra's net' denoting an interconnectedness of all action and phenomena.For Bates, the wyrd includes supernatural experiences related to dreaming and altered states involving guidance from animals, spirits and plants. These experiences have been (according the the Introduction) snatched from old Saxon texts. Unfortunately, this programmatic element brings a certain rigidity and lack of spontaneity into the text which never develops beyond an awkward tale.TWW lacks the humor one enjoys in Castaneda's books. The severity of the Saxon shaman Wulf cannot match the bright sparkle of don Juan's eyes, neither can the stolidity of the narrative match the mystery and unexpectedness that one finds in Castaneda.Nonetheless, the book represents a credible attempt to broach a topic that has been neglected by scholars and fiction writers alike. The lay reader gets info on spiritual beliefs of West Saxons, Picts, Mercians, Angles and Gaels.

This is a valuable book written by a Westerner who, for a change, allowed the Q'ero to speak for themselves. The book is composed of several sections introducing the Qero reality archetypes, energy body, the system of energy fibres (ceques) connecting the awareness and material world and working with the spirits of the mountains (apus). Another section is devoted to the Qero mesa and its stones; this includes very practical advice on how to establish rapport with a stone and about the importance of reciprocity (ayni, a key concept of Andean shamanism); at the end there are some additional instructions on clearing the luminous body of unhealthy energetic imprints, "metabolizing" heavy energy, communicating with the ancestors and gathering energy from nature. A large part of the book is devoted to interviews with a group of respected Qero pampamesayoqs and altomesayoqs.Taken together, the book is a valuable (easily obtainable) resource for people interested in altiplano shamanism. For people more interested in the practical aspects of the Northern Coastal tradition I'd recommend Matthew Magee's Peruvian Shamanism; there is also the more scholarly Joralemon's work). The book is respectful of the Qero but at the same time shows them with their human faces, humor and foibles. Thankfully it avoids both the supernatural crap that one finds in the New Age market and the dryness of professional scholars and sceptics...There are problems with this book, too. The author herself, a member of the so-called "Nunez mafia", is a beginner and is not in a position to achieve a synthesis of what she heard from the paqos (healers) and her experience. As a result, the accounts are sometimes inconsistent and at other times unclear. The material for the book seems to have been collected in a single interview conducted over 3 days with a single group of Qe'ros; not speaking Quechua Wilcox was forced to rely on translations of her mestizo companions, who sometimes pushed their own (incorrect) interpretations (see the section on "pushing the kausay") which are duly recorded in the book. Basically, Wilcox is trying to run before she has learnt to walk and one could, perhaps somewhat uncharitably, attribute to her self-promoting motives which are not necessarily in line with self-effacement that characterizes altiplano shamans. Moreover, the book appears hastily written and would definitely benefit from more editing. Be that as it may, there is a lot of valuable information (particularly in the chapters written by Freddy Puma) and the book is worth reading. it was written by an amateur committed to the Andean worldview and practices.

Sometimes it is hard to believe that there is in Peru something else that Afro-Peruvian music and Los Incas. There is. Tito La Rosa has managed to distill and capture the essence of Peru and brought it as a friend and a collaborator to the New World in the North in line with the ancient Incan prophecy.This CD succesfully combines pre-Incan sounds (using authentic instruments) with Native American flutes. But there is more. La Rosa is an authentic healer steeped in several Peruvian traditions and his music is a direct portal into the wisdom that has been preserved to this day. The music is gentle and delicate, yet filled with power and energy of munay (the heart). Highly recommended; if you can, get his other CD too (Iqaro Canto Shamanico) which is based on Amazonian (Shipibo) traditions. Spectacular stuff.

This is the best movie i saw in 2005. Great writing, directing, acting, fast paced and intelligent.We are not who we think we are, black is not different from white, there are laws of life that an alert soul may recognize and follow - or not, sez the film. No stereotypes here, just imperfect people caught in situations that you and me have been and will be caught in in the future. How will we respond? Who are we anyway? That split second will tell.

Recent Balkan wars represent a succinct example of the incestuous relationship between culture and brain function. A multicultural, relatively prosperous society with a high degree of inter-ethnic marriage is torn, within a year or two, into murderous fiefdoms. Appalling crimes are committed and justified by appealing to old myths resurrected by political expedience. Europe watches, helplessly, as veneer of civilization is torn with people reverting to Old Testament tribal eye-for-an-eye brutality.This book tries to explain the causes and conditions that propelled Serbs into renting asunder of (an illusory?) tribal harmony in communist Yugoslavia. The main thesis is that Serb personal, political and religious life is defined by myths (of Serb defeat by the Ottomans, of "Serb exceptionalism", etc). Several chapters attempt to show that the genocidal streak in the Serbian national mythos originated in a violent 19th century poem calling for elimination of Turks and their collaborators. Anzulovic shows that, far from resisting occupation, Serb aristocrats were valuable vassals of Ottoman Turks, helping to consolidate Ottoman power both through troops and personal service. There is an intriguing link between the Serb tradition of banditry and its disregard for victims which may be relevant to our understanding of the Bosnian war. Pace A., in Servia, cruelty when successful is admired; thus Serb paramilitary atrocities in Bosnia created a vicious self-reinforcing circle that was actively encouraged by intellectual, artistic and religious elites in the Serb capital (Belgrade). The author shows a particular scorn for the Serb Orthodox Church which has been an enthusiastic supporter of the Bosnian genocide through its "St. Savaist" populism. As far as the Belgrade Patriarchy is concerned, murdering innocent Muslims does not contradict Christ's teachings. In other words, for a few blood-soaked years the Serbs represented an Orthodox version of the Taliban.Much of what A. says appears, to an outsider, convincing. The zeal with which Serb civilians, paramilitaries and soldiers tortured, maimed and murdered innocent Croats & Bosnians should be contrasted to the effeteness, confusion and lack of professionalism of European (British, French and especially, Dutch) armies which watched the genocide on the ground, sometimes from yards away. If I was in Afpak I certainly would be concerned if I had to serve next to the craven Dutch troops whose surrender of Srebrenica should represent a case study for every contemporary military school.The book is not without problems. While trying to explain the Bosnian war, A. overplays the sway of mythos over the Serb "soul' while overlooking the role of Milosevic's opportunistic populism and the naked economical self-interest of Bosnian Serbs. The endless referral to violent medieval Serbian myths, poems and works of art overlooks the fact that almost every culture possesses their equivalents: Popol Vuh, Icelandic sagas, Warao creation myths, you name it. Finally, while the Serbs are portrayed as monsters egged on by their deviant cultural and religious institutions, the author overlooks the neighbors: Croats, who as Nazi collaborators committed far greater atrocities [that were said to disgust the Waffen SS itself]]; Albanians who are running arguably the most efficient and ruthless pan European drug trafficking and prostitution operation in history, Hungarians, who have their own sordid history of medieval slaughters. Claiming, as A. does, that the Serbs have a monopoly on violence and atrocities is absurd. Anyone who's read Burkhardt's seminal Civilization of the Renaissance will know that cruelty was the order of the day amongst the pre-Italians. Like the Bosnian Serbs, the Hutu perpetrated the Rwanda genocide mostly because of the their need for more land; historic hatreds were an excuse.If A. is ethnically Croat, then one should consider this book as a (yet another?) salvo in the inter-ethnic rivalry between the two Slavic tribes.I'd say this book should be read with reservation as the lack of objectivity and pro-Croat bias make it apparent that the author's main goal is to demonize a historic antagonist/competitor. Anzulovic is a partisan, not a scholar and the book should be read as another installment in the propaganda jostle between Southern Slavs.

If I was asked to bring one meditation book to a desert island, this would be it. It is both lighthearted and profound, informed by practice of teaching, sitting....and living. Although Roche was originally trained in the TM tradition, he is his own man and the instructions he provides in this book are light years away from rigid, tradition-bound scripts one is likely to encounter in most Buddhist- or Hindu-type meditation schools. Above all, this is about common sense, about learning to grow into happy and fulfilled human beings.Anyone who has ever set foot into a meditation retreat has probably seen Westerners working hard to concentrate on the breath, a mantra, a yantra (i.e., shamatha). The problem here for most of us is that the impulse comes from the mind and therefore the effort, in the absence of proper training, is also mind based. It is more important, says Roche, to first open our field of awareness, to relax our sensory pathways clogged by tension and thought by systematically learning to open vision, hearing, somatosensation, smelling etc to the present moment. If this is done with interest and pleasure, one can enter the meditation space effortlessly, like meeting an old friend.We also need to learn to relax our memories, find safety and home in our experience, and to clean our lives physically, emotionally and spiritually. This, and much much more, is also in this book - reams of valuable advice, communicated in a warm and friendly way. Highly recommended!

A beautiful sad profound film shot with clarity, empathy and understanding of the complexity of civilized living. Quality of life means being embraced by family ghosts, stories and secrets and by objects given life through those stories. Objects that are murdered when placed into a museum.The film acknowledges that modern life can disconnect yet makes it obvious that there is a common denominator, that of authenticity bestowed by one's inner life. Eloise touching the flowers in front of the emasculated house. Eloise watching her patronne wilt after the departure of grandkids. The Paris couple adjusting to life with grace and humor; the girl's sadness upon realizing that she has just lost a priceless part of her childhood. It seemed to me that the expat siblings were missing something essential - as if cutting links to their old home and country diminished them subtly, irreversibly. The film wasn't easy to watch, my grandfather had a similar grand old house & garden etc. And I now live far away.Films like this make us sad, but also make us more real.

Hancock's basic thesis has been well described by other reviewers below. H. champions the popular Lewis-Williams hypothesis that cave art reflects shamanic rituals performed under trance conditions (often induced by hallucinogenics). This hypothesis he connects to his own experiences of having met "alien intelligences" in hallucinogenic journeys induced by ibogain, ayahuasca and Psilocybe. With the little help from his plant friends Hancock encounters Egyptian gods, ancestors, transcendental snakes and weirdly sinister alien types with slit eyes and subsequently combines these pieces of information into the suggestion that human evolution has been guided since time immemorial (actually, since about 30 000 BC) by discarnate intelligences living in "other dimensions".To prove this idea, GH goes fishing for corroboration: he finds it in tales of UFO abductees, who claim to have been taken onto alien spacecraft, hoisted with "implants" and forced to nurse alien-hybrid babies (i am not making this up). Then he is struck by the similarity of the fairy lore to UFO abduction tales... again, the idea is that these "alien" creatures have been with humankind from dawn of our consciousness and that they are responsible for its awakening -through trance states induced through dancing, sensory/physical deprivation or hallucinogenics. They may even have messed with our DNA where Hancock approvingly cites Narby's ideas about DNA as a "cosmic serpent".Like most of Hancock's books, Supernatural is well-written, representing yet another display of a natural storyteller's talent for delaying hapless readers' gratification - all the while leading us along winding roads decorated with sightseeing trinkets represented by UFO abductees, DMT trippers, prehistoric caves, Francis Crick, therianthropes, spirits and San Bushmen from Southern Africa. The book is superbly illustrated with representations of cave art from Europe and Africa and has a great intro into the murky politics of prehistoric art scholarship. However, while pretending at practicing the art of investigative reporting and objective analysis, GH is anything but. This book is all about selective citation, where *only* case studies, theories and ideas that conform to GHs grand hypothesis are cited whereas opposing views literally don't exist, with the exception of those that are easily debunked (i.e., Lewis-Williams' detractors). In other words, this book is an entertaining read, nothing less... and nothing more.Yet - if you do chance upon it, read it. You'll have a good time.

In this book, Frantzis Kumar describes techniques which are essential for all energy work as well as a precondition for practicing internal martial arts; that is, he gives detailed instructions on opening the channels that control the flow of chi ("the energy gates"). By following the instructions step-by-step the practitioner learns to generate an uninterrupted flow of chi through the major meridians and dan-tiens. Any dedicated practitioner of aikido, tai-chi, chi-kung, capoeira and other martial arts knows that this is not an easy thing to do - learning to manipulate chi takes years of practice and one has to be lucky to have instructors who are willing to impart this knowledge. Internal energy techniques used to be (and still are) rather secret in China and it is rare to encounter a Chinese master who is willing to teach these to non-Chinese disciples. That's why we're lucky to have this book written by a Westerner for a Western audience.Kumar starts from the beginning, with techniques designed to dissolve energy "knots". He then describes all the major points on the meridians where stale energy is wont to accumulate and introduces a simple Cloud Hands practice, which is an optimal way to open the shoulder blades and the pelvic girdle (stretch them darn psoas muscles!). He ends with teaching a simple spinal stretch method (which reminds me of Feldenkreis).The book is filled with helpful hints and admonitions. It is also well written, unlike many other similar manuals which tend to suffer from mistranslations and bad grammer. Written text of course is no substitute for a live teacher, whose help is crucial so that we learn to correct the warped micro-postures and subconscious mis-alignements that tend to plague our steps into the wonderful world of energy work. As a supplement, however, i think Kumar's book is very useful and i recommend it highly.

The Kama Sutra says, about the `public woman': After acceptance she should please him; when he is infatuated with her she should suck him dry of his wealth and at last abandon him. This is the duty of a public woman".This, in essence, was the strategy Rajneesh, a balding potbellied holy man, used with the people who flocked to his flat in Bombay, his sprawling `ashram' in Poone and later to the commune in Oregon. Seduction, followed by indoctrination and total mind control. This book is an instructive story that should be a required reading for nave devotees flocking to India to sit at feet of more than imperfect `holy men' who have no compunction about mind control and (sex)ploitation. Here is how Milne describes his first meeting with Rajneesh:"One hand still holds mine as the questions continue, as if he is practicing the gentlest ever form of mind detection. There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information. Letting go of my hand, he moves his left arm behind me. I sense a presence hovering over the crown of my head. He rests his hand there and stares off into the middle distance, sensing, checking, listening, all his being attuning itself to mine. Then the soft hand moves to my forehead, waits, listens, wafts to my throat and presses so gently on the cartilage there. Every chakra is discretely touched. The chakras recognize the arrival of a friend."Dangerous man. After his grandfather died at the age of seven, Rajneesh resolved to never become attached to another human being. As a youngster, he was an admirer of Gurdjieff, experimented with the occult, breath control, magic and hypnosis, making himself an outcast in his own family.Milne, attracted at first by `tantra' practices (a Rajneeshi synonym for "free sex for all"), eventually became a personal bodyguard and, as a member of the inner circle, a close witness to the rise and fall of one of the greatest spiritual scam artists of the XXth century. When Rajneesh proclaimed that `sex was divine and natural' he became attractive to Europeans and Americans who were fleeing the straight-jackets of puritan morality. These people paid their price: they were made to renounce their wealth and work, sleep-deprived, 12-14 hour days/7 days a week. The earnest work by the Occidentals must have gotten a chuckle or two from the Indians, for whom any physical effort is a degradation to be avoided at all cost. The (mostly Western) devotees were controlled by a tight-knit group of Indians led by a truly scary `Ma Anand' Sheela character. Milne describes the woman as aggressive, greedy, amoral without any empathy or remorse. Sheela was responsible for creating a concentration camp in Oregon and committed what may be the first bioterrorist attack in the US.Milne, who today is a well known teacher of alternative medicine in California, does not appear in a good light in his own book. He had aided and supported Rajneeesh through his worst excesses, watched coolly as the guru played at social engineering - putting together and dissolving relationships, forcing thousands of women (including 14 year old girls) into sterilizations or even prostitution... so long as he was able to be close to the guru and have a piece of the action.In the end, both Rajneesh and Sheela managed to escape long prison sentences. However, in what appears now to be a sort of `karmic' retribution, the more he took advantage of people, the more Rajneesh began to suffer from mysterious diseases, allergies, headaches and nosebleeds. At the end, the man was expelled from the US and died in India embittered, an empty shell of a person with few disciples and no joy in life. Ma Sheela, on the other hand, these days runs two retirement homes in Switzerland.This book opens important questions on the nature of evil. Who/what is evil? A horned, petty, bad vibe Beelzebub entity who everybody instinctively turns away from? Sounds kinda ineffective. How about an acclaimed holy man with loads of spiritual insights, excellent teaching & profound books - who also indulges in debauchery, mind control, accumulation of obscene amounts of material wealth and whose the devotees are toiling like slaves to support his indulgences (all the while continuing to worship him), a man who runs a spiritual concentration camp with support of sophisticated acolytes like Milne? 'Gurus' such as Rajneesh introduce a cognitive dissonance into the devotee who in time loses the ability to discriminate right from wrong, putting all their trust into holy man's 'guidance'. This - the robbing of personal initiative and willpower - is pure unadulterated evil.Rajneesh failed as a luminous being - failed big time. His unearned talents were squandered in the egoic quest for self-importance, good time and control. In other words, R's supposed "wisdom" is simply ink, squirted in our direction by an octopus of an Ego retreating into the depths of the fundamental refusal to face, and accept, the illusion of itself. We can only be thankful we do not encounter the same temptations that the venerable "bhagwan" succumbed to.What we get in this book, then, is a cautionary tale urging us to see through and avoid spiritual charlatans who are trying to create an aura of specialness and mystery around themselves. There are lots of these people all over the place. What they say may be right yet what they represent is the exact opposite of what they preach. So watch for the squirts of the Wisdom Ink: they represent a measure of delusion - not love, not freedom and not truth.

This book arguably represents one of the most influential and original linguistic/philosophical achievements of the XXth century. It is remarkable for its simplicity, breadth, clarity, depth and what to me looks like a certain uncontrivedness that undoubtedly reflects a mind that is rooted into something fundamental. De Saussure, a Swiss linguist, provides a system which articulates the boundaries delimiting 'language', 'speech' & 'writing'. Language is essentially a social phenomenon construed of signs that derive their meaning/form from human interaction. Saussure first looks at language in an evolutionary context as a living organism situated in an ecological niche. Next, language is defined as an emergent system composed of interlocked signs. A sign is any device through which beings communicate with each other; a red dot in the mid-brow signifies a Hindu devotee, for example. The original insight here is that words which in themselves are arbitrary embody meaning through an inherent relationship between the 'signifier' and the 'signified'. By deconstructing the sign into its components (form and meaning) Saussure provided a new tool - "semiology", a study of signs - a toolbox which was used to categorize and classify not only languages but any cultural constructs.de Saussure provides several examples of how meaning is generated and retained in a language despite enormous changes in how words are written and pronounced. Structure of a language is defined by the identity of individual sounds (phonemes) that constitute it, by the way they distinguish themselves negatively from other sounds and by the rules which combine letters into meaningful words. This is explained physiologically by discussing the generation of sound by the glottis, mouth, lips, nasal cavity, oral cavity etc (P. 42) - thus, the Chinese/Japanese neither hear nor can vocalize with control the sounds beginning with "l" or "r" just as we have trouble with the click languages of Africa or guttural/palatal sounds of the Native Americans.I wonder how Saussure's ideas apply to more primitive alphabets such as Hebrew where each letter corresponds to an object/animal or Egyptian/Chinese pictographs where a written word represents a visual image that is decoupled from sound.Saussure's classification of sounds has paved the way for structural linguistics of Jakobson and influenced Chomsky & provided a foundation for structural anthropology (Levi-Strauss and his classifications of tribal relationships), even defined postmodernism as we know it. Baudrillard's System of Objects is based on de Saussure. When Derrida rails against the primacy of speech he is battling (ineffectually), Saussure.This work is easy to read and provides a foundation to much of modern linguistics, social psychology, anthropology, philosophy and, one might argue, computer science. The book is basically a meditation on the way we structure reality - language shapes thought that separates between constituents of reality and in turn, the mental entities composing thought shape language. For me, reading it, many things fell into place.

This book is a compilation of Ed McGaa's lectures at an &quot;upper income, midwestern, metropolitan suburban school&quot;. In it, we mainly get his personal views and experiences of the &quot;Natural Way&quot; which, generally speaking, represent the tradition of his native Lakota Sioux. McGaa's credentials are pretty good: he claims to have studied with Frank Fools Crow and Bill Eagle Feather, without doubt two of the most influential Sioux medicine people. This therefore is an opportunity to partake of life experiences of an insider who is willing to share his views of God, religion, spirits and interconnectedness of life. We learn of such key elements of Lakota worldview as the 6 Powers, the Wakamaskan (animal brothers), yuwipi, Sun Dance, details of Black Elk's vision and the attitude of reverence and respect towards the &quot;Great Mystery&quot;. Native Americans cannot comprehend the concept of a wrathful, revengful God, nor can they understand the concepts of sin and &quot;being saved&quot;. They have seen what we have forgotten - that what makes a person harmonious, kind and peaceful is their closeness to Nature which gifts them the power of presence (is it therefore surprising to see that the people who wreak discord in the world are characterized by their disconnectedness from Nature and their own bodies?)McGaa has a lot of beef with organized religion and by golly do I agree with him. According to him, the concept of heaven and hell was great for the priests trying to to keep in control ignorant masses. The more we shed our ignorance, the closer we get to the Great Spirit and the freer we are from the leeches trying to take over our spiritual life. This is why, says McGaa, knowledge is so crucial. Knowledge leads to wisdom, wisdom leads to understanding, and understanding leads to peace. The key to developing knowledge is observation. We do not have to believe anything : it is enough to be patient, observe and draw conclusions for oneself.In short, this is an eminently practical book written by a knowledgeable person of great integrity. I recommend it.

In this book, Alford examines the idea that human culture and indeed human genes may have been planted onto this planet by extraterrestrial intelligences. Following the pioneering explorations and speculations by his predecessors von Daeniken and Sitchin, Alford examines several &quot;unexplained mysteries&quot; - from ancient Sumeria, pharaonic Egypt, Baalbek to Stonehenge, Nazca and Peru. He points out the unlikelyhood that the monumental buildings, found at those sites, could have been constructed with simple Iron Age technologies. To support this thesis, A. provides interesting information, especially on less conventional research which tends to be omitted from the &quot;classical&quot; anthropological and historical work. I found his take on pharaonic records and Giza pyramids especially intriguing; moreover, Sitchin's work on Sumerians is given due credit .While unfailingly interesting, the book has noticeable shortcomings. Alford's uncritical approach to published (and unpublished) literature is troublesome. He is quite happy to take a flimsy idea and present it as fact while conveniently ignoring other contradictory evidence (especially if it is &quot;conventional&quot;). He is also prone to citing, in the same breath, data from reliable and accepted studies and highly speculative notions based on hunches and zero evidence. Sitchin's work is accepted a bit too uncritically and with too much reverence which ultimately hobbles the book. Thus, in his enthousiasm to prove the extraterrestrial connection, Alford tries to do too much and, for me, undermines the credibility of his main idea. Still, if you are an aficionado of this genre, you will find a lot of food for thought. Which, ultimately, is what counts.

In this book, James Hillman resuscitates the platonist notions of fate and the soul. Basically, the soul of each of us is given a unique daimon which slips into our bodies before we are born and then we pretty much spend the rest of our lives figuring out what the daimon wants from us. One way to do that is to pay close attention to our motivation, our urges for creative expression which reside in our feelings of uniqueness and grandeur and the restlesness of the heart. Another way is to pay close attention to the invisible world. Hillman is very helpful in drawing our attention to the many ways that the invisible can manifest itself through, such as the spirit of a place, the quality of a thing, the soul of a person, the mood of a scene, the style of an art, the goosebumps of a memory...The role of the daimon is to keep the invisibles attached (to the soul) and the spirits (the manifestations of the invisible) smiling and pleased. When the invisible forsakes your world and life is no longer backed by it, the daimon gets mad and the world tears you apart. This happens a lot in our culture. &quot;Our modern passages are so narrow and with such low ceilings&quot; sez Hillman, &quot;that the invisibles must twist themsleves in freakish shapes in order to come through&quot;. How then does one bring the invisible forth? One way is by paying attention to intuition (which is our vessel for mythic perception), another by giving respect to our ancestors and our spirit friends and yet still another by cultivating beauty. Beauty has been defined by the neoplatonists as invisible presence in visible form and a divine enhancement of earthly things. According to JH, beauty is food for the soul.Since the daimon is closest to us when we are young, it is crucial to pay a lot of attention to harmonize one's child's life to beauty and to the ancestor spirits, which are concerned about the welfare of the descendant's soul, through which they can see the world. How does one go about nurturing the child's soul? JH suggests 3 important elements: (1) parents must have a fantasy about the child (imagination is the language of the daimon) (2) there must be odd, eccentric fellows around the child and (3) obsessions must be given courtesy. The worst of all atmospheres for the daimon arises when your parents have no fantasy for you because they themselves have suppressed their own daimons and consequently, never grew up. As a result, the father capitulates to the child and we get &quot;a child dominated fatherless culture with dysfunctional children with pistol-packing power&quot;.Although this book has many valuable passages, I have to confess that for me it was slightly disappointing - i think that it is not written according to standards we have come to expect from Hillman. The prose has an air of hastiness, incompleteness and (perish the thought) simpleness. most of the ideas have been already elaborated at length in other H.s books, such as the (splendid) Dream and the Underworld and the Psychology Revisited. On the good side, this book is probably less opaque than both aforementioned ones and may represent a good way for the novice to enter the conversation with an erudite, deep and fascinating investigator of the human condition.

Freeman is similar to Gibbon in that he is opinionated, even passionate about his subject topic and it shows. The man knows he has a good story. He also knows that he is digging in hallowed ground that many would prefer to remain undisturbed. After all, the credibility of televangelists, Opus Dei and fundamentalist hacks rests squarely on being able to persuade the credulous that the Bible is a `word of God'. It was amazing to me, driving through Florida the other day, that at any given time there were at least five stations devoted to literalist transplanting the neolithic wisdom of the Septuagint into 21st century.Well, this book shows that the New Testament, especially the canonical `gospels' were chosen for a large part due to an almost arbitrary intersection of fate and political necessity, rather than their authenticity per se. Constantine, the sponsor of the Nicean council, couldn't care less about the doctrine of Trinity - he apparently had never attended a Christian mass - yet he and his succeeding emperors eventually capitulated to the insatiable appetite of an opportunist Christian sect for political power. As a result, from a creed based on brotherly love, Christianity morphed into a rigid, hierarchical movement that abhorred individual expression, sensuality and free will - all qualities which, incidentally, had been the centerfold of Greek and Roman `paganism'. The ancient pagans marveled at jihadist passions with which Christians embraced their deaths in Roman amphitheaters and were amazed by how Christians seemed to hate each other's factions more than pagans themselves. Paradoxically, neoplatonist pagans supplied the Christians with probably their strongest philosophical weapons, as Christ `the Son" came to be associated with `logos', the eternal unchangeable order/truth. To use platonism as a weapon for fanaticism and suppression of competing sects was not a little bit ironic. It was however highly effective politically in ways that Plato could not have foreseen. Freeman shows how church "Fathers" such as Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose and John Chrisostome succeeded in transforming Christ's message of love into a message of power, and Christ himself into a warlord, riding at the vanguard of Christian armies. And it goes pretty much downhill from here. It seems to me Christ opened the door for some of the best - and the worst - of human behavior in the Western hemisphere.There are a few well-deserved kicks Freeman reserves for the likes of Alexander `the Great', that narcissist who caused much destruction in the physical and philosophical worlds and Apostle Paul, whose self-loathing, fear of intimacy & sexuality and power lust have crept into the Christian dogma and have never let go. It was Paul's metanoia together with the Apocalypse that have inspired the most irrational and non-reasonable strands of Christianity up to this very day. The linchpin of Christianity from the 4th century on has been that dissent is not to be tolerated, that independent thought is un-holy and to be condemned and that Christians should do as they are told by their "pontifex maximus" or his equivalent. In no time bishops became rich operators who cared about political power more than their flock. Theoloigcally speaking Aristotelian rationalism, logical thinking and science became an anathema until Thomas Aquinas ... but in reality, they are anathema today, in Vatican as well as in the White House. This book therefore is rather timely.Freeman explains the history of the Greek/Roman empires and religions breezily and somewhat perfunctorily. For me the book came alive after the Council of Nicea. I think an excellent job was done in balancing the needs of adequately summarizing the (often arcane) philosophical arguments and issues with the simplicity of presentation needed to keep the attention span of the interested lay reader. It worked for me.

This album offers an eclectic display of medieval music. We get pieces from the Cathar, French, Spanish, Andalusian &Sephardic traditions - yet the tunes blend easily - just like the bizarre beings in the famous triptych by H. Bosch melt into a fascinating whole. The Bosch painting is intensely personal, as each viewer picks out the details, patterns and configurations that speak to her.... and the same is true with this collection of 14th & 15th century music presented by La Nef, the sextet founded in 1991 by Sylvain Bergeron. the pieces are all played with medieval instruments (including lute, oud, the vielle, psaltery and santur); La Nef adapted a few pieces to address modern sensibilities, yet the adaptations ring true to me; perhaps this is what the Cathars really wanted?! I have listened to this CD many times and will listen to it again. And again. Recommended.

This is a guidebook to achieving 'success" in the business world through application of perception practices developed by Tibetans. The book is based on sound Buddhist methodology, written by a highly competent and experienced person (geshe, no less).One potential concern is that some of the suggestions and ideas Roach writes about are about becoming a clever manipulator. Becoming skilled in these practices gives one an edge over fellow humans. Roach himself is controversial, has broken his monk vows, was excommunicated from his order, renounced by his teacher Geshe Thubten Rinchen, and is no loner welcome in Dharamsala. One view of his current situation might be that Roach is pioneering a new, revolutionary Vajrayana path; other views are not so charitable.This work opens the question of compatibility of vajrayana and business practices. I can understand that Roach is selling the idea that business canbe a 'chop wood-carry water' activity, no different from practice as, say, meditation. Yet, i know of no zen monks or Tibetan masters who actually subscribe to or embody this idea. Modern business is based on profit and ego. Perhaps tantrikas rightfully scorn the traditionalists. Yet the guy who comes to mind is no other than the ultimate scam master, Rajneesh himself. Dangerous territory.

This film has an all too rare combination of tight scriptwriting, great scenography, intelligent and powerful acting and an understated yet impeccable directing.The atmosphere of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire (re-created, if i read the credits correctly, in Prague) with its officious and fussy officials and confident courtiers convinced of their superiority, with great cities and remote hunting lodges, brings to us an era that even most Europeans have forgotten about. The film plays with contrasts - social contrasts between a lower class upstart, a middle class policeman and aristocrats; 'epistemological' contrasts between positivists, professional magicians and believers in spiritualism; contrasts between romantic passion and status... and above all, in what is a version of a Clint Eastwood riding into a dusty town, the ultimately romantic twist of a stranger appearing in Vienna with nothing but a bag of tricks.The plot is tight, with many surprises and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a smart and suspensful, but also funny and romantic, movie. Recommended.

In this book, Pinker - nowadays a popular science writer - writes about two ideas that have permeated the Western world from the Enlightenment until today. The "Blank Slate" was championed by Locke who assumed that man is born with his potential ready to be entirely shaped by experience; according to a simplistic version of this hypothesis, appropriate 'nurture' can mold his character, personality and social success according to his educators' desires. The 'Noble Savage' idea piggybacks on Rousseau. It assumes that there is a nobility inherent in being uncorrupted by civilization. Pinker is critical of both, but never quite points out that he criticizing the most banal, lazy & bastardized interpretations of Rousseau and Locke. Few if any credible contemporary scientists believe the simplistic version of BS/NS hypotheses presented by Pinker who feeds us in his book the classical straw man fallacy. Was is it essential to devote 600 pages to the claim that genes are important for brain development and human behavior?The chapters resemble collated yet disjointed compendia rather than sustained and original thought. It took Darwin or de Saussure decades to think things through; some celebrity writers, however, prefer to act as latter day cultural hunter-gatherers foraging for ideas that agree with their preconceived notions. Pinker is one of them and this book is one of those compendia.In my view, the book is riddled with revisionisms, disinformations and half-truths as well as omissions of uncomfortable facts, which I attribute to disorganization and lack of time as well as a weird politicization. Pinker ignores contradictory anthropological/linguistic research (such as Everett's seminal work on the Piraha or Geertz' work on the Balinese). His ideas about violence are particularly simplistic; how about, say, the Inuit or the Javanese where violence is typically directed inward yet bursts outwards in irrational (and extremely rare) acts of violence and revenge? I was irritated by what I perceived as political agenda which smacks of neoconservatism, an anti-intellectual movement based on greed, zionism and militaristic expansionism. There are countless paragraphs attacking what P. and his friends at The National Review perceive as perfidies of neomarxism and left-wing academia. Even the Chagnon controversy is couched in stark left vs. right wing terms. Worse, there are approving citations of sociobiologists like Watson and Skinner whose ideas have done incalculable damage to education and child-rearing.Imo, Pinker represents a scientific incarnation of Faux News. The man's idea of balance is to contrast nutty views held by proponents of Intelligent Design to first class work by SJ Gould, S Rose and Dick Lewontin. He seems to believe that a fictional Gould-Rose-Lewontin cabal - consisting of the top evolutionary biologists and population geneticists of the XXth century - tried to inflict left wing bias onto the unsuspecting public unlike, for example Dawkins whose rather primitive neodarwinism is cited approvingly. Crazy, I know - but there's Pinker for ya.

Very little (if any) Nei Kung can be found in this book. Mostly, it is a naive and self-indulgent autobiographical narration of the author's experiences with non-ordinary reality. As such it is a take it or leave it affair and, in the absence of practical information about chi practice, I am inclined to take the book as a yet another fairy tale. Danaos thus missed a chance to make his name as a Nei Kung teacher. Internal martial arts and energy work in general are amazing things and we need good books... however, this is not one for a serious practitioner. To people interested in learning more about Nei Kung I'd recommend any of the books written by Frantzis Kumar, a master with impeccable credentials and someone who does not play hide and seek with his readers.

A Shipibo ceremony in the Southwest. A story that morphs, slowly, from a linear narrative into a metaphysical Reality that is more real than real. A spiritual stand-off. A contraction into basic principles. Truth can be cold, love is a force, contracts go way back in time.This is not simply a film - these guys know what they're doing.Impressive!

This is a nice book that covers many basic aspects of life among the Wolof and Fulani (Fulbe), West African peoples living in today's Senegambia, Mali and Burkina Faso. The book covers the basics of beliefs, rituals, family life, spirits etc. in an open-hearted and simple manner. Lots of little details about plants, animals, initiation, relationships with the elders, village life, music in this book.On the down side, the authors have striven to show only the best aspects of the village life and the book appears somewhat aseptic. West African villages (like villages anywhere in the world) are rife with envy, greed, sorcery and conflict between people, families, clans, villages and tribes. Africans, well-known masters of 'witchcraft', are spending inordinate amounts of material and time resources on protecting and attacking fellow villagers. Or as a buddy of mine from Togo says, "fixin' things." Benin/Dahomey, from which originates most of what is known today as vodou, is just next door. There is no mention of these practices in the book, as if West Africans lived in lovey dovey New Age communes. Nor are there real life stories of actual people in the book, or what in my opinion is the greatest minus of the book, do we read about experiences and personal beliefs of the authors themselves.Nevertheless, i recommend the book, as it shows how integrated community life is into ancestral patterns and spiritual frameworks in West Africa.

Over the years I have listened and owned a number of CDs of this genre and this is one of the deepest and most powerful.These people are not kidding. The sound and the rhythm of these songs are creeping out of chthonic depths in an endless spiral, with sincerity that both encompasses and transcends the opposites. Traditional and trailblazing, hypnotic and ecstatic, the music pours into the body through thousands of tiny pores. Makes you want to use the music itself as a tool to get to places in which the only currency is pure intent.Can't miss with this CD.

Who is better qualified to delve into the neolithic mind than the two South African world-class paleoanthropologists? Lewis-Williams and Pearce suggest (sensibly) that we can access the minds of the first 'city' dwellers because we share the same basic neurological circuits and socio-cultural behavioral patterns. Thus, the architecture of their sacred/profane spaces provides us with a tool that we can use to probe the neolithic minds that created them.The Neolithic and the origin of the contemporary man can only be understood if we know, understand, how humans relate to what we moderns call "supernatural".This idea is not crazy. Cosmology implicit within human 'material' and 'spiritual' reality can be explicated through myths that guide the life of contemporary native peoples. A case in point would be the 50 000 years' old painting found in the Mutawintji caves or the painted narratives of Kalahari San who have maintained an unbroken spiritual-artistic tradition for thousands of years. Thus, the minutiae of relatively contemporary depictions of San 'shaman's' trances match what was painted by their ancestors 27 000 years ago (spirits leaving people's heads, shaman's therianthropic transformations, and the climbing on ropes of energy into the sky).While in the Upper paleolithic the threshold into the netherworld was negotiated through caves that often descended deep into the bowls of the Earth, the Neolithic man seems to recreate and control the cosmos through man-made structures. In this way, he gains spiritual control over the cosmos, animals, and his destiny. He is able to help his family and hurt his enemies. The authors suggest that the Neolithic man/woman switched from "horizontal shamanism" where everyone participated in magical rituals to some extent, to "vertical shamanism" associated with social stratification and emergence of all-powerful priests which were able to transmit specialized knowledge within a small elite and thus gain political power, economic influence and religious domination (sounds familiar?!). This permitted the organization of large and coherent social groups but also started the curse of organized religion which has remained with us.There are insightful discussions of possible meanings of assorted female figurines, "the great hunt" images, metaphors of supernatural potency, burial practices (including the famous excarnation panels at Catal Huyuk that appears to resemble the Tibetan Sky burial), and other types of the ubiquitous death-and-rebirth symbolism.The book purports to show how "neurologically tiered cosmology can be embodied in structures that people build" and how "labor and buildings unite religion, social structure and cosmology." It does not succeed in pat because the authors actually seem to know close to nothing about the brain. The reliance on an outdated Macleanian idea of the 'triune brain' does not inspire confidence. Despite this puny detail, I found this to be an intriguing book that, by building the tentative bridge between paleoanthropology and neuroscience, is charting new and exciting, territory. It seems to be completing an Eliadean cycle whereby science leads us back into the myth, symbols and the origin of the human race.

Alessandra Belloni is a singer, dancer and actress with impecabble credentials: she studied Commedia dell'Arte with Dario Fo, worked with Anna Magnani and Federico Fellini and, as one of the greates female percussionists in the world, she has performed with Glen Velez, Olatunji, Mickey Hart and Gilberto Gil. Her main interest is in ancient peasant music from Southern Italy, with its syncretic mix of Catholic and pagan influences. Here she demonstrates the Calabrian tarantella, a quick dance the origins of which stretch back to the Dionysian rites of ancient Greece. In the Middle Ages, the tarantella was allegedly used to help tarantulla-bitten peasant women in Southern Italy sweat the poison off their bodies. In reality, however, the quick tempo of the tarantella which unleashes the power and ecstasy that resides in the woman's body was used to excite erotic passions in men. In this CD I can see why.Belloni is a true visionary whose exquisite beauty and power breathe out of every piece on this CD. From medieval prayer chants to peasant celebrations and love ballads, the music evokes the ecstasy that occurs when the body becomes a vessel for ancient forces that rise out of the land and its cycles; it shines with the tremendous power of the feminine reaching all the way back into ancient shamanic roots of Europe and ancient Greece. It is a rare occasion indeed that these rhythms became available. Highly recommended.

One is not supposed to stray from form in Indian classical music. Can one, then, capture the form by dashing away from it, returning for a bite, tossing it into the air, playing with it and yet remain deadly serious? "Rise" shows this creative play with the classics is not only possible but enjoyable.There are some lyrical songs here (such as Voice of the Moon) and powerful ones such as Mahadeva (my favorite, written by Ravi); both Mishras are, well.... the song takes me deep into a dark temple with brahmins about to perform a ritual sacrifice :)What impresses me about this CD is the love of music and Shankar's talent for experimenting with instruments, musical forms, people's talents and song-making. She's an Indian Bjork. The pieces show a sense of humor, earthiness, seductiveness and power and, at least for me, represent an experiential antipode to Anoushka's equally talented peer, Sheila Chandra and her monastic, out-of-this world sound.Excellent CD.

&quot;We had people who could tell us about the old days and why they were important to us. The story of our people was like a song. As long as somebody could sing it, it was real. It never mattered if someone wrote it down. When you came you said our song wasn't real because it wasn't written down. Then you wrote it down the way you wanted it. Our history was alive. But your history was dead, even though it was written in words. &quot;This is an honest and open-hearted book which aims at giving us the Native American perspective on the relationship between the whites and the reds. The anger, the bitternes and the incomprehension which the Indians have for the white man's robot-like obsession with possessing land (how could land, a living organism, be possessed?) and acquiring goods are depicted touchingly via a series of conversations between the author and an old Lakota man. The book is skilfully written and has many humorous passages. It is easily readable but for me it was not an easy read. It is hard to be reminded of the extent to which the Lakota (and other N.A. peoples) were physically, morally and culturally battered and, almost, vanquished by an almost inhuman, greed of the invaders. The desperation, with which they have watched their animal &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; disappear. It made me very sad. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the N.A. point of view and who wants to take a breather from the deluge of books on N.A. &quot;spirituality&quot;, which paradoxically, tend to perpetuate the separation between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. If you want to learn about respect, listening and generosity, read this story, listen to its songs.

It is rather interesting to see the controversy surrounding Wallace Black Elk and his activities. Although Wallace is a Rosebud medicine man with impeccable credentials, he has become too well known and that means he has broken an unspoken taboo that cannot be forgiven within his community. Many Native Americans, like so many other peoples (indigenous or not) simply cannot tolerate the success of one of their own and are prepared to do anything to bring them down. After all, a true member of the tiospaye is supposed to be self-effacing, humble, generous... and poor.I cannot be a judge of Black Elk's character. But I know a good thing when I see it. Anyone who has had even remote experience of Lakota healing ceremonies will know immediately that with this book we are given a great gift. The book will be useful to all who want to understand social and ceremonial aspects of Lakota life and the practical manifestation of their worldview and religious practice. God knows that our country and our planet are in need of these teachings. We get highly useful descriptions of major rituals, such as the Kettle Dance, the sweat lodge and the &quot;vision quest&quot;; more importantly, we get an intimate glimpse into a Lakota medicine man's relationship with his spirit helpers and guides and with his sacred pipe (Chanunpa). The book bristles with the reverence for the pipe and with acknowledgement that the medicine man is only a channel (&quot;a hollow bone&quot;) for the Spirit. There can be no question about Black Elk's credentials, about the validity and importance of his experiences and his ability to heal people through sacred Lakota ceremonies.The book is also funny in a way that Lakota themselves can be funny by being at the same time self-deprecatory and self-congratulatory. Black Elk obviously enjoyed the process of describing his experiences; he also inserts a few pages on his encounters with unindentified flying objects and their denizens but I suggest the reader checks this out for herself.In short, this is a warm, informative and rewarding book that addresses crucial elements of Lakota religious life through the words of an authentic practitioner. It glows with gratitude to Great Spirit, Mother Earth and the Chanunpa. I recommend it.

This is captivating music. Medieval and folk polyphonic German, Latin, Italian, Bulgarian, Greek pieces many of which with sacred themes (Libera me, Domine). Sparse string (cello & bass) accompaniment (basically playing chords). There is dispassion in those voices yet how much history, how much power, how much authenticity.

Flowers tries to transplant the model that worked so well in 'Crash' to this petty small-minded drama... and fails. The failure IMO encompasses several levels. A multi-plot drama like this requires super-precise script-writing, something that clearly did not happen in Haven. There is also a need for a larger, dramatic connecting thread - and the petty brutality and sordidness depicted in Haven did little to illuminate the superposition of greed, lust, inexperience, hierarchy, friendship and love (not to mention alcohlism and drugs) that rule the expat universe.The movie lacked DEFINITION, a certain inner conviction and consistency. It is a pale reflection of the tight brilliance of Crash, which now seems to have been ... a shooting star.

Daniel Pinchbeck's greatest feat is that he has managed to find his way right into the heart of the post-New Age crowd that keeps trying to find answers to life's trying questions. This book describes P's wide-eyed wanderings from one (pseudo)shaman to the next; this includes several spiritual/commercial eco-trips that guide him into partaking substances such as ayahuasca, iboga, Psilocybe, DMT, LSD, NPT etc. And we should not forget the Burning Man, where Pinchback's amorous impulses finally land on receptive grounds. Whew! It did take a long time.In any case, the book shows the man as a psychedelic butterfly - flitting from one hallucinogen to the next, never pausing to REALLY look inside. Unsurprisingly, the' visions' and 'insights' are very tame -as can expected given the lack of preparation and serious commitment. This 'postmodern shamanism' has little to do with spiritual search and everything with achieving a dopaminergic high. Believe it or not, P. is considered in the impressionable universe of the psychedelic underground as somewhat of an expert on psychedelics and shamanism (not to mention polyamory:).In my opinion, this book and its follow-up serve as cautionary tales of what happens to people who dabble in indigenous shamanic technologies without adequate preparation, humility, commitment, stamina and long-term teachers/traditions. Countless hippies and 'psychonauts' have destroyed their minds in the same way.I do have to emphasize that the book is well written and that despite naivete, selfishness and general sense of P's disorientation that cry out of each page, the author comes across as a sincere and earnest guy who knows how to string a good story. Unfortunately, he is trying to walk before he's learnt to crawl. One can only hope that when he gets tired of talking, he'll drop the 'psychonaut' thing and start learning from the beginning. Unless he fries his brain beyond repair.

OK, I'll admit right away that i don't get the criticisms below. i am one of those people who shudder at the adaptations of the Beatles, Stones, the Led, Dead Kennedys or Bobby Zimmerman. Yet i love this album. Some pieces (like Dancing with Myself or The Killing Moon) are better than the originals and others (like the Human Fly) or Bela Lugosi's Dead - the adaptation of the famous Bauhaus song - are almost like new songs, originals themselves. The singing is subtle and intense at the same time - this is no lounge music. Remind me of Pink Martini, only better.

This is a simple and touching book written by Malay-speaking Dutch expat whose job was to study nutrition habits across Malaysia. Wolff comes across as a great champion of the Malay kampong and the dignity, understatement and grace that are the basis of Malay (and Javanese) social behavior. Which are the very polar opposite of, say, Chinese pushiness, greed, money-grubbing, ostentation and loudness; no wonder 'bumiputras' keep the Chinese down. Anyway...in this book Wolff writes about ordinary Malays, and about the original, non-Malay inhabitants of the peninsula (the "Orang Asli", of which Wolff contacted the 'Senoi', a protoKhmer-speaking group) who have retreated deep into the jungles to escape enslavement by the majority Malays.The book is basically a meditation on the nature of health and disease, of the boundary between the modern and the indigenous as well as a window of what it means to approach other cultures with sensitivity and integrity, and with an open-hearted and conscious naivete. Wolff would support the modern "integrative" medicine approach of today - where the doctor is not a harried impersonal stranger dispensing chemicals to faceless patients but rather someone who (like the Malay "bomoh") intimately knows the patient and treats the disease in a comprehensive manner that includes mental and physical symptoms.For a Malay and a Senoi, according to Wolff, happiness lies in the kampong (village) - in hanging out, intimate sharing; these people invest their 'wealth' and energy into personal connections that are based on respect. You will never see a Malay tell another person -even a child - what to do. Unlike what is the case with the Chinese, and us Westerners, traditional Malays never flash their wealth or try to be "better than their neighbor". There is no need for 'personal' advancement since you already have what you need: which is YOU. And everyone is accepted - that's why you don't see a kampong sent their idiosyncratic members into a mental hospital - they are taken care of for who and what they are. I liked the episode where the Western visitors, upon relaxing under the great tree in the kampong 'plaza' see a shadow of a man flitting from one hiding place to another. "who is this", they ask? "Oh, never mind, that's our thief' replied the villagers. Even the thief is a member of the community and understood for what he is.The most poignant and poetic chapters of course deal with Wolff's interactions with the Senoi, who (according to him) appear to live in a form of a Dreamtime where all that maters is sensitivity to the present moment. One does not plan or over-talk - one just does what feels right. And if one is connected to the larger whole, this un-selfconscious act then contributes to unfolding of that interconnected pattern. This pattern can be discerned by observing the present, as well as the dreams (including, apparently, lucid dreams) which are recounted and analyzed in depth. Wolff then realizes that the difference among people is not a difference of language, but rather of how we experience what is real. In fact, i believe some of the most concise, clear and instructive depictions of native relationship to the world are found right here in this simple tome; this book literally helped shift my own experience of reality. A great book.

Can we, by practicing a discipline such as Tai-Chi, refine our sense of self, our Being-In-The -World? Catherine David, in this sublime book, investigates the space that is behind the physical movement, behind the conscious mind, at the very core of what constitutes our sense of the Self - that space which gives birth to our sense of beauty and which can be translated through innumerable ways (including the Tai-Chi exercises and piano playing) into wordly manifestations of our uniqueness. In this space imagination and sensation are interlocked, like lovers. Once we realize that Self is just a metaphor and that the mental image can be the impulse to opening of a technical skill , we hold the keys to true freedom. In this society in which the essential is generally considered incidental (which is reflected in the unberable dullness of the contemporary man), Catherine David picks the essence from inconspicuous corners where it has been gathering dust and shows us how she uses it to unlock the gates leading to inner beauty. By doing this she helps us glimpse and perhaps touch that space. This book is a rare treat.

With this CD Reyes takes the listener on a journey into and beyond the sensuous, right into the metaphor where our non-ordinary self has hidden itself from the vulgar obviousness of the consensual reality. This is a world of mystery, feelings, power and gateways. The universe of orgiastic celebration, transcendence and of coldness beyond coldness, evoked by Reyes, has the touch of the impersonal about it. Not for the faint of heart; the Jaguar sun has little mercy for those who resist being devoured.I find the combination of pre-Colombian percussion instruments and synths in Reyes' music very effective. And I think that many a journeyer will find this music of great value.

As anthropologists fanned around the world they brought back detailed accounts of shamanic practices of indigenous peoples from Africa, Asia, Siberia & Native America - but not from Europe. European shamanism (including druidism) is thought to have been largely stamped out due to the combined efforts of Enlightenement and the Holy Inquisition. The book opens up the question of the many similarities between Germanic, Latin, Slavic agricultural cults and their relationship to the Dionysian rituals as well as the issue of universality of core beliefs that underly indigenous practices around the world.The book also pioneers a new understanding of Europeans and their history - one that focuses on the peasant and his relationship with the land (and the Church). The aristocratic elite that controlled the politics and religion of mediaeval Italian city states was just a tiny fraction of the population; Ginzburg therefore opens up a new (and should i say delicious) can of worms.This book represents a huge step forward in our understanding of European shamanism. Ginzburg burrows deep into the 16th century Inquisition archives from the Friuli region of Northern Italy (where Latin, Slavic and Germanic traditions come together). He returns with a fascinating discovery of an ancient fertility cult, whose participants (the benandanti) represented themselves as defenders of harvest and fertility of the fields. A benandante was someone who four times a year during the Ember days left the body and went "invisibly in spirit" to fight the witches and the devil - "we fight over all the fruits of the earth and for those things won by the benandanti that year there is abundance", said a peasant while questioned by the Inquisition. The benandanti were united by a common element of having been born with the caul (i.e., wrapped in the placenta, which was thought to be an object endowed with magical powers). The departure of the spirit from the body, which was left lifeless, was understood as an actual separation, an event fraught with perils, almost like death. The soul was considered very real and tangible. "We crossed over water like smoke and following combat, everyone returned home as smoke...". The soul was always associated with a spirit animal (usually hare, but also pig, rooster, mouse etc.). This was a world of spells, incantations, evil eye, herbal potions, spirits and communication with the dead.Ginzburg shows that these beliefs in 16th century peasants were all-pervasive and deeply connected with Earth and its cycles. The Ember Days (i.e., Christmas) festivities had survived from ancient agricultural cults and symbolized the changes of seasons, the passage from the old to the new time of year and a promise of planting, harvest, reaping and autumn vintage. Ginzburg paints a interesting picture of Italian Inquisition - that of a huge centralized organization which was inefficient, swamped with bureaucratic legalisms and in most cases not that interested in prosecuting "ignorant peasants" . The book also champions a rather controversial thesis according to which the Church managed to steer the perception of the benandanti cult from representing fertility rites to that of witchcraft and the devil, almost as if the Church created the very devil that it abhorred. Interesting parallels with modern times, I should say.

Castaneda is always a valuable read. The man has, single-handedly, introduced more fundamental concepts into the contemporary mainstream of shamanic studies than anyone else I know. Assemblage point, luminous fibers, medicine plants, spiritual warrior, dreaming, stalking are now commonly accepted terms and, dare i say it, practices?! At the same time, the man himself -dead and alive - has eluded attempts at categorization; he is not as prissy as Eliade, simplifier and popularizer like Harner, neither does he seem to be in for the money, like perhaps the majority of book-writing modern would-be &quot;shamans&quot; and &quot;sorcerers&quot;. Methinks this very fact should make one curious and interested.The Art of Dreaming does not disappoint in this regard. It seems to be quite consistent with C's previous work and IMO C is quite effective in depicting the complexity of the worlds that may be accessed during one's dreams. For ordinary humans like you and me this work reads like fiction, because in order to access even the most rudimentary of these worlds, one would (according to Castaneda) need &quot;energy&quot; acquired through time-consuming and effort-full practices. We don't have this kind of energy. Yet myself, at the very least, have a deep respect and admiration for this wily old man who gave us so much food for thought. He seems to care for one thing above all others - freedom. AOD is about using one's dreams to become a freer person. That means living one's life with dignity and gusto and AOD certainly is something worth reading at the side of a pool on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

In this book Ra Un Nefer Amen, who appears to be an African American guy from Brooklyn, tells us about a new religion that is essentially gnosticism wrapped in Egyptian clothing. A few Egyptian words are inserted into the text to convey key concepts. Nefer Amen projects his ideas/insights onto these words ("The Law of Tehuti", "The Law of Sekher") without much regard to what they meant to the Egyptians. Despite the title, the book tells us nothing about the actual ancient Egyptian religion, their ceremonies or even what "Maat" represented to these people (for that, you will have to read someone like Assman). I find this pretend Egyptologizing rather misleading.Amen's projections are pan-religous and syncretic, and include random bits of science, Qabbala, theosophy and other assorted esoterica. Although the final product may seem a bit weird, the book does have a few insightful paragraphs. I especially liked Nefer Amen's approach to peace and his ideas about oracles. So, a book that will appeal to a niche audience. As for myself, his references to Ausar (Osiris) reminded me of the Infinity Blade :).

This film is a breath of fresh air. A dysfunctional set of family members living in their own separate private hells is forced together to deliver Olive, the 6 year old daughter, to a 'Little Miss Sunshine beauty and talent show'.The meta-narrative running through the movie is the American obsession with winning together with the pathological contempt and lack of compassion that many Americans show for losers... Paradoxically, the film shows that a loser is really someone who has denied their own heart...In the midst of this dysfunctionality is one bright spot - Olive's innocence, guile, trust and lovingness that bring child's realness and love to the family. Everyone seems to somehow suspect that Olive is their only link to sanity. When it really matters, the family pulls itself together around this shared love and defends it against what can truly be described as horrific pathological expression of adult narcissism: a beauty pageant for little kids. Those little faces covered by mascara were truly scary.... parents who make their children go through this hell are manifestly unfit for parenting, to say the least. I wonder whay shows like this are legal in the first place? Why do little kids have to pay the price for adult narcissism?Anyway. The movie is actually funny and entertaining. Its simplicity is profound, and its message touching. It reminds the soul of what really matters. So that when one leaves the cinema, one feels more present and alive.

There are many ways of looking at this film. On a straightforward level, the writer & director play with stereotypical polarities: post 911 Americans vs Arabs; Arabs vs sub Saharan Africans; Arabs vs Israelis; legal vs illegal; young vs old; bureaucrat machinery vs ordinary folks...... yet what stayed with me long after the film was over, was the sheer humaneness of it. the film trusts people - the dignity and decency that are everywhere if one cares to scratch the surface of one's own skin, and that of our fellow travelers. In this sense, drums are metaphors for the rhythms of life. the music sublimely written by Jan Kacmarek is Oscar material. As are the script, directing and acting.in other words, while the film never shirks from looking pain straight into its glowing eyes it delivers a message of realness and hope. this is real art, the art of film making. so all i can say is "Bravo"!

In this book, Paul Stoller, an ambitious graduate student, tries to make sense of social life of Songhay-speaking people in the eastern Niger. The Songhay have once possessed the largest empire in African history; their formidable magician-king Sunni Ali created an elaborate and effective administrative system extending all the way up to Timbuktu and even Morrocco and, as Stoller shows in this book, Sunni Ali's memory is still very much alive in contemporary Niger.The book follows Stoller as he wanders around Songhay villages trying to document social mores. He quickly finds what M. Mead never did - that polling and questionnaire techniques he was taught in the US do not work with the Songhay. In Niger, a direct question typically elicits an outright lie; effective field work consists of listening and participating whereas direct interrogation is counter-productive. Stoller then falls into the hands of a local "sorko", or magician-healer, who offers to teach him the secrets of the trade. At this point, the author is faced with the question: should one maintain, in bona fide anthropological work, classical aims of "objectivity" and "impartiality" or should one immerse oneself totally and completely into indigenous life, risking drowning into it and being forever lost to science? Stoller does neither: he is awed by the power and mystery of the secrets that he is witnessing yet at the same time he seems to be unable to comprehend the most elementary laws of indigenous shamanic practices. Thus, like the proverbial deer facing headlights of a car, Stoller is is constantly paralyzed by incomprehension and fear.For me, the book provides more evidence for the hypothesis that the "Western paradigm" is just one of many, and not that empowering at that. If we start to tinker with our paradigm by "apprenticing" to cultures based on hard, merciless and pragmatic obsession with spiritual power (such as the Songhay) we are in for a tough ride. Stoller was; he ran away and I do not blame him.On the other hand, the dialogues in this book are great and often funny and the book is a must read for anyone contemplating visiting Niger, Mali or Burkina Faso.

An interesting take on Sci-Fi, is BSG. At it's core are ultra-conservative values and a fascination with the military. Buddy camaraderie, loyalty, family, military hierarchy, patriotism are endorsed and revered. Abortion is banned. The exiled humans follow their "scripture", an unabashedly fundamentalist Biblical plan which turns out to be literally true (!). Having their Scripture, humans can safely eschew mystical experience which is something that the "Cylons" have a mono-poly on. Let us also not forget that the plot is based on 12 human colonies trying to find Earth (ie, "Zion")!On the other hand, intellectuals and scientists are demonized (cowardly, crazy and traitorous), as are unions and civil society advocates (power-hungry ex-terrorists) and any mental-emotional sophistication (likely to be manipulation by Cylon enemies). In other words, the show could have been (and perhaps was) written by a Dobson-Cheney surrogate in some military Psy Ops room or another. if so, the creators should get medals for it.Because the show works. The drama and its protagonists suck me right in every single time. Great writing, directing, excellent acting, great selection of actors which, surprisingly for a 'fundamentalist' show, feature women in key combat roles. That was an excellent call; the Lt. Starbuck character in particular mixes macho posturing and femaleness in a weirdly unique and unflinchingly consistent way. So one roots for Galactica and her crew and is happy and relieved every time they blast their way through Cylon lines.the director certainly does not spare viewers' sensibilities. The language is raunchy (what the frack!), violence is depicted graphically with no details spared, the creators of the show revel in all kinds of abuse and torture; the graphic nature of confrontations at physical, psychological and cultural levels is imo quite effective. BSG and its cousin Stargate represent polar opposites to the philosophical sophistication and enlightening aspirations of shows such as Star Trek or early Star Wars; they're the Sci-Fi equivalent of redneck pulp that catalyzes people's inherent fear of the "Other" rather than teaching them to be better, more 'enlightened', humans. Of what use is personal growth and happiness if there is a terrorist hiding under every rock? Unfortunately this is the kind of pulp i like. Just as unfortunately, i am not alone.

First there was Wilhelm Reich, a pioneering genius who was essentially ignored and whose books were burned at the stake. Then in 1950ies Eugene Gendlin and Carl Rogers had a great realization: our body is a repository of our dreams, potentials and the only way to healing the mind is to unlock the body, to touch its 'felt sense'. Then there was silence in the psychotherapeutic community............. a silence that always occurs when people realize someone has figured something out. And then, suddenly, EVERYBODY and their mother jumped and somatic psychotherapy was born. Embodiment of the mind was addressed from every imaginable angle - neurophenomenology (Varela), mindfulness/Taoism (Kurtz & Hakomi), movement (Feldenkreis), countless forms of Gestalt, somatic experiencing etc. And during the post-Castanedian 80ies, Arnold Mindell enters the stage with his angle, that of shamanism, the "dreambody" and "process work".The dreambody is a place where the unconscious meets the conscious, where dreams & reflections encounter bodily states. By listening to one we get access to the other, and vice versa. The insight is almost identical to ideas by Gendlin, Reich, Jung and before them Pythagoras and the Buddha. Of course we must not forget native peoples who couch the 'dreambody' layer in mythological terms and who (together with Carlos Castaneda and unlike Gendlin & Reich :), are lionized as Mindell's teachers. According to M., a shaman uses her dreambody to step out of linear, mental space into feelings and "Intent".Mindell:"There are times when you are alone in nature and feel united with the environment. You feel the world around you as if it were a body part or a partner, sending messages of agreements or disagreements, pleasure and stress. This sense is crucial if you need to fish or hunt to eat.... When the world speaks to you, it is impossible to tell whether the world is doing things to you or you are doing things to it.As you live, you confront your mythical attackers in many forms until you change the way in which you define yourself. It seems sometimes as if you have just one central lesson to learn: to continuously drop all sorts of rigid identities"Mindell provides a number of exercises derived from Jungian active imagination and, through much of the book, attempts to graft them upon a pseudo-Castanedaist framework. He tells us to look for an "ally" in spontaneous dance or movement or in disturbing thoughts or feelings. He advises us to store the body energy and power through noticing unpredictable, subtle body feelings; he recommends we follow them instead of throwing them away. Thus, if you follow the body it is your helper - otherwise it is an opponent in need of healing, because it lost pieces of its soul. If even half of the case studies happened as described by Mindell, the man is also a brilliant therapist with rapier-like intuition.I can't help but to also lay out a few things that irritated me. As i note above, Mindell is bad at crediting his therapist predecessors and perceived competitors, the very people who actually pioneered body-mind-imagination techniques he uses in his work. On the other hand, there is much name dropping which follows the tired rigid formula used by people who tour the New Age workshop/seminar circle. As if. If you haven't discovered anything by yourself, why, the next best thing is to go and spend a few days with a few Africans, Aboriginees or maybe Native Americans, and call them your "teachers". Be on constant lookout for an interesting event usable for self-promotion. Presto, instant credibility with no responsibilities - no need to study and understand what these people actually do and mean. All you have to do is translate what you think was happening onto your own theoretical framework.The book itself is remarkably superficial. Once he gets the "dreambody" concept out of the way, Mindell is left with nothing left to say. So he leaves us with scores of case studies (all of which, of course, are a paean to the man's brilliance) and a lazy interpretation of Castaneda's ideas. While some concepts look like direct translations of Castanedian terms into Mindellian psychotherapy, there is, to me, a notable disconnect between much of what Carlos was about and what Mindell believes Castaneda's terms mean. I doubt sorcery for CC was a game of active imagination. At times, there is willful misinterpretation of Buddhist and Taoist ideas so that M. can underscore the significance of his New Shamanism. And so on.This is a not unreadable book that may persuade some people to pay attention to their bodies and dreams. To work with the netherworld existing between the body and the dreamworld can only bring rewards.

This book follows Boyd after his meeting the eclectic Tuscarora medicine man and documents their travels across the country, with the aim of promoting inter-religious dialogue and cooperation. It is written well; Boyd managed to captureMad Bear's culinary and other idiosyncrasies in a way which is genuinely funny and, at the same time, filled with valuable information about modern native medicine. With native Americans information rarely comes in an explicit way; likewise, the most valuable stuff in the book is hidden between the lines: the Tuscarora/Iroquois dreaming practices, the practices used to take care of and obtain feedback from nature and the commitment to working together with spiritually aware people from all over the planet.The Native Americans understand (suggests the book) that these are important times when teachings have to percolate from their keepers to a wider, global audience, that we have to work together to neutralize the forces of chaos and greed that are destroying the fabric of life on this planet and that life can be an amazing and mysterious adventure if one allows it to manifest itself through us. These things are brought forth in an easy conversational style, especially in the first half; the second has to do more with specifics of Boyd's own participation in inter-Indian dialogue etc which I did not find as gripping. Still, this is a valuable book and if you want to learn how to speak (and keep your mouth shut) with the Indians, you will found it useful.

In this book Villoldo, perhaps one of the most well known teachers of Inca shamanism in the West, describes his initial encounters with the shamanic world. The book is devoted to Villoldo's experiences with two Peruvian healers - don Ramon Silva (an ayahuascero from the Peruvian Amazon) and don Antonio Morales, (a Qero style healer and philosophy professor!). Villoldo's recounting of Peruvian healing practices is gripping and the final chapter, in which he describes the death of his teacher's teacher in a little cottage on the Peruvian altiplano, is simply breath-taking. I also quite liked the description of the "operation" which allowed V. to see energy patterns and his animal allies.If V. only recounted his experiences with the old shamans, the book would have been superb. Unfortunately, he decided to insert into the book his own personal issues and musings on the nature of reality (which tend to go on and on) and which to me seem to be rather cliche-y. this guy is a doer, not a thinker and all the theory just detracted me from the magic of his experiences. V. also seems to be unduly impressed by his newly acquired Ph.D. in psychology (from a little known local college) as if a degree means anything these days.Still, I find Villoldo's accounts to be trustworthy and in my opinion this book is a useful read for people interested in Peruvian healing practices and in energy work in general.

Every now and then one has the good fortune of stumbling upon a musical gem - a piece of music that touches, reveals and inspires. Hurricane Child is such an album. It is intensely intimate, at times perhaps painfully so; yet it reaches into depths whose haunting beauty and terror are known to us all. These depths are the wellspring of true aliveness and Lori has dived deep into the well to bring us gems of existential insight. Body Mine, for example, is an absolutely brilliant song, a song that celebrates the emancipation of the body from the oppressive influence of the Other. Our Body is our Temple, and how can we love in this world, if we are detached from our bodies, if we do not love them with passion and kindness and forgiveness? Is That You is another beautiful one, it is a poem celebrating relationship between the mother and her daughter ...Lori's music is simple, profound and sweet. If you want to celebrate being a human, you can't miss with this album.

I enjoyed this film for its precision. Allen knows exactly what he wants and the actors are on the same wavelength throughout. That, my friends, is relaxing. It is not that he brings a light touch to the set. And (gracias a Dios) cleverness and humor take a second seat in this film to something much more juicy and profound. Makes me think Woody's 'got it' - this is about the art of being with people, humanness, celebration of uniqueness and imperfection. And also about observing, experiencing, participating ... and making films. The Craft.These days it seems that in Woody's hands even a cliche becomes poignant, like a wink from a beautiful passerby. He creates a paradise and then takes it away; after all, this is about life.

Much of the popular understanding of the Plains Indians is based on the extensive and ubiquitous literature on Lakota Sioux. Other tribes, such as the Crows (Absarokee), the Arapaho, or Gros Ventres tend to be overlooked. Especially Crows. These beautiful people were THE principal enemy of the Lakota and although just a fraction of their number, the Crows were very successful in heckling the Sioux bands and keeping them at bay.These book is a recapitulation of the stories of such exploits. Stories, which would have been forgotten, if not for Joseph Medicine Crow... we hear about the introduction of the horse (in 1700s; the Crows call the horse &quot;ichilay&quot;, which means &quot;to search with&quot;), the &quot;buffalo jumps&quot;, invented by the Crows, and the interminable war parties and horse-stealing. The war was not waged for conquest, gain of property or territory: it was the ultimate sport, a game of wits, chivalry, bravery and honor between the tribes. The Crows were incredibly successful in raising horses: so succesful that in 1919 the secretary of the interior issued orders that they must get rod of their horses. The governement contracted bounty hunters, hired planes and helicopters and killed tens of thousands of animals... a tragic and traumatic experience for the Crows, which was worse than the military defeat. Still, the Absarokee were spared, to a large extent, the large scale depredations by the US military, due to to the role played by a Frenchman named Pierre Chienne, who practicaly wrote the provisions of the treaty that chief Blackfoot signed in 1868.There are many stories about grizzly hunting, about old shamans, vision quests and military exploits. About the historic defeat of the Sioux, who tried to exterminate the Crow tribe in 1900s once and for all by attacking with 10 000 warriors. And lost.In short, this is an entertaining and informative book about a remarkable people. i recommend it highly.

An unremarkable yet in its own way powerful and touching film.for me, the best moment was the very beginning, with the old guy retying a rope over the bundle of foraged wood, while his camel looked on, making faces. There was something poignant, deep and timeless in the old man's face, in the way he began telling the story. The camel of the Gobi desert is the astounding two-humped Bactrian camel, looking like a Tattouin creature from Star Wars with beautiful long golden-brown hair and intelligent moaning noises. I never tired looking at these guys. the family was filmed (in my view) with too much restraint, the filmmakers made it look like a portrait rather than a living breathing family.As for the film, it was obviously made by beginners who relied a bit too much on the visual imagery alone to tell the story. While this can be (and is) effective, at times there seemed to be a need for more editorial control or insight. For example, the roughness of the Gobi does not come across very well, we see very little of the desert apart from the space surrounding the yurt, and we get only a tiny glimpse of the elements (ie, sand storms).The Bon ritual depicted in the film was nice, if filmed a bit superficially and out of context; yet more powerful was the grandmother propitiation of the spirits of the 4 directions with offering of milk; great similarities with Siberian & Tuvan traditions here.All in all, an amateurish but enjoyable film.

"When the doctor sings it's like he's snake charming. The pain gets hypnotized by the songs and starts rising in the body to see what it is and when it's close enough to the surface the doctor can take it out by sucking, or with his hands." a Yurok shaman, p. 139This is a seminal work edited by LJ Bean, today perhaps the foremost authority on CAlifornia Indians. It compiles, in one place, field data from the Northern tribes (Yurok, Karuk, Wintu, HUpa), Central California (Miwok) and the South (Cahuilla, Luiseno etc). In addition, there are chapters on rock art, toloache (the Datura-based religions of the Cahuillas, the Luiseno and even the Miwoks), the Kuksu (among Pomo and Maidu) religion and the Revival religions such as the Ghost dance.A central concern of this book is that of the Native relationship with power: personal power, acquired by one's ability to perceive sacred beings and power sources (ritual paraphernalia, quartz crystals, human and animal bones, feathers, and plants such as angelica) and community power, derived from the shaman's status as a leader, healer and witch-doctor (In California as opposed to the Plains, priests and shamans usually came from chiefly families and were trained in high caste secret societies. Power was, according to the Indians, differentially distributed in both time and space and came from the sacred "Dreamtime" when the universe was created. The authors provide many anecdotes from transcribed sessions with their informants; what I especially liked was that, in general, the emphasis was on description and not on analysis. This makes for exciting reading.Shamans were political leaders, and they supervised the regular yearly burning process under oaks, pines and mesquite to maintain good harvests, control plant diseases, parasites (mistletoe), bugs and poison oak as well as to improve the quality of seed and straightness of basket grasses and arrow reed. They were also healers, prophets and poisoners enaging in "doctor wars".I found the discussions on the use of datura, Rattlesnake shamans, Deer- or Antelope shamans, Bear shamans, Acorn shamans, "Poison doctors" , soul loss and Singing doctors very informative. The poison doctors, for example, often obtained their powers hereditarily and were taught by a parent the use of quartz crystals and the eating of roots of poisonous plants, and they were encouraged to practice hitting a feather stuck in the ground as a target with porcupine quills so that they could successfully hit people with their darts. Many of these practices seem to me to be very similar to Australian aboriginal ones.The book concludes with a couple of excellent chapter written by native Californian Indians themselves, and with an analysis of the worrisome encroachment of non-native traditions (such as the sweat lodge, as it is practiced by the Plains tribes) into native (Californian) practices which are consequently facing the danger of disappearing, as the young strut the sexier Lakota style. Also we see the tenuous and often antagonistic interactions between the the New Age "neo-shamanism" and indigenous tribes, who resent the encroachment of the white man and his perceived usurpation of their religion. This book doesn't take sides; it does however provide a valuable contribution that will be of interest to anthropologists and laypeople alike.

This book consists of a stream of letters from Swami Satyananda to a female disciple written around 1960. The book does not provide us with her perspective which however can be inferred from the tone of Swami's missives which is at times encouraging, admonishing, disappointed and congratulatory. The book lays out, in no uncertain terms, the requirements laid down generations ago (perhaps by the original Shankaracharya himself) that need to be met before Kundalini is to wake within a safe and non-selfish container. These demand absolute discipline, an ethical stance, commitment to others and rigorous daily physical, mental and spiritual practice.It is all in here. The mantras, visualization practices, energy practices, crystal gazing, long-distance healing, thought transmission. It is a system and Bihar Yoga has it down. The tradition is very clear about what is required from the lay person, what is possible and what are the no-nos. Absolute obedience to the guru is a precondition. The system "cannot be given to the weak, to the one attracted by sex, to the credulous, to the undevoted or unsurrendered one, to the lustful one, to the non-yogi, to one who is a slave of the body, mind and material possessions; not to one who is not a sadhaka, nor to one who is not a Hindu - never indeed to him!" [p. 63]. I guess this shortens the pool of potential applicants :). Perhaps things have changed a bit since the 60ies.Even non-Hindus, however, can now see the beauty, rigor, profoundness, clarity, impecabbility and commitment to the welfare of the planet by the system presented by Swami Satyananda. Reading about it I was inspired, amazed, and grateful that such teachings exist and are transmitted across the ages.

WHat does &quot;spiritual&quot; mean? What is an awakening? Who am I? What is God?A lot of ink has been spilt in trying to address these questions. The mind likes to lose itself in existential dilemmas and it likes elaborate theologies. Sometimes it is not easy to see whether asking these questions or reading &quot;spiritual books&quot; brings one closer to Being or pushes one farther away. This book is a step in the right direction.Jacobson strips the spiritual endeavour to its bones. According to him, what matters is to be present and still and to own every aspect of ourselves, no matter how abhorrent it may appear to the ego (mind). We have to learn to surrender patterns of control in our lives, stop believing in our thoughts and beliefs and release the past. The only way to do this is to learn to honor our feelings and to allow the heart to speak once again and to &quot;make sure that there is nothing in our lives which we love more than God&quot;.There is a lot of talk about God in this book. Myself I am not necessarily religious in the old fashioned sense of the word, yet Jacobson's reverence and delicateness impressed me and shifted something. The way Jacobson sees God as related to Presence and Silence and interconnectedness, and yet as unfathomable and mysterious, speaks to me and also reminds me of what I consider to be the best in Buddhist thought.In any case, you can't miss with this book. It will invite you to just BE over and over again and how can one refuse such an invitation?

In this elegantly titled book Abrams argues about a "language older than words" - a language of immediacy imbued with connectedness between an (indigenous) person and her environemnt. The landscape talks and sensitive and attuned people listen and hear it speak. Abrams' `ecophenomenology' coincides with a plethora of similarly well-intentioned works that have appeared in recent years.Abrams shares this basic idea with others - phenomenologists, philosophers, linguists, ethnographers and anthropologists many of whom performed research on indigenous peoples from around the world. For an indigenous person the intimacy between the landscape and the inner space of feeling is rather ordinary and normal, certainly nothing special. That someone has to argue that this communication even exists is, to someone living close to nature almost incomprehensible.Be that as it may, Abrams quotes other people (indigenous folks and their observers) copiously and not always consistently. His own contribution I find a bit sketchy and perhaps even problematic. For example, he goes to great length trying to shift the blame for the ecological blindness of Western man away from his/her absurd belief in a warlike, genocidal and jealous Hebrew deity onto Greek philosophers and their use of abstract language. This is not a little disingenuous, since it wasn't ancient pagans who wrecked the relationship between the Western World and forces of nature, but rather the fanatic followers of the 3 monotheistic religions blindly marching towards promised salvation. Now the entire planet is paying for soteriological orthodoxy and its distrust of the body and nature.Perhaps a more serious concern is that although Abrams pays lip service to the indigenous relationship with the landscape, he does this through the prism of his own logocentric viewpoint rooted in Western anthropology and phenomenology (ie, the book is based on Husserl and Merleau-Ponty). Abrams' use of concepts which is ostensibly aiming at disentanglement from the conceptual double-bind(s) reminds me of a fly ineffectually buzzing around spider's web. Apart from the Introduction - which is promising, as it suggests Abrams will use the book to talk about his personal experiences, insights or revelations, the book itself is a brainy, abstract and a superconceptual treatise, I personally had to skip pages as it sometimes simply got too boring. The diametric opposite of SOTS would probably be Jensen's Language Older Than Words - a brilliant personal expose on the same topic which, for reasons unclear to me, received much less attention. Be that as it may, the interest in SOTS signifies that ecophenomenology is here to stay and i personally am happy about it.

It is impossible to study Chinese history without encountering hermit anecdotes. Any mandarin worthy of his station would have been familiar with taoist/buddhist lore; the best generals and emperors had teachers amongst recluses; some hermits had kingdoms thrust upon them. It may not be an exaggeration to say that the hermit embodies what is (used to be) the best about China: wisdom, passion, ruthless work and a continuous tradition that stretches back into the neolithic. Porter, a Taiwan/Hong Kong-based translator was curious whether hermits survived the insane maoist decades so he invested a few years into traveling the Chingling mountain area around Xian in the heart of contemporary China. Chingling mountains (together with the Emeishan and Qingchengshan areas) have been a refuge for taoists and buddhists for thousands of years. Beautiful places that used to house hundreds of temples most of which were destroyed by Mao, or (if they were lucky) allowed to pass into disrepair. While passing crumbling temples and huts along ancient paths and trails, Porter ruminates about events from Han, Tang, Chin, Zhou dynasties, recites famous poems about misty mountains and mossy bridges and talks (fluently) to the locals.The monks, nuns and laymen he meets are impressive, far removed from the pushiness, greed and survival games played out in the rest of the country. I was touched by their wisdom, lack of guile and inner beauty. Loved those people.Yuan-chao, a 88 years old nun living in an adobe hut on a mountain: "tantric practice is closer to zen. It's the pinnacle of zen. But it's not for ordinary people. It's like flying an airplane". Porter asked her to write down the essence of Buddhist practice; She put the paper aside and did not raise the subject again. Two months later he received a sheet of paper from her in the mail with 4 words: "goodwill, compassion, joy, detachment."Kuo-shan, an old monk encountered on the trail and asked how he can survive the hardship: "It's all the same to me. It just looks hard to you. [...] I cant read. I never went to school. I just meditate. [...] I'm a monk. I've seen through the world of red dust. As long as i have enough to eat, I stay on the mountain."Te-Cheng: "You can't practice just one kind of dharma. That's a mistake. The Dharma isn't one-sided. And you've got to practice the precepts. If you don't, your life will be a mess. It's like making a fire. You need more than a spark. You need wood and air too. It's the same with enlightenment. It's a system. All practices are related. The mind has to be one. In Zen, you have no thought. In Pure Land, you have one thought. They're both the same. "Master Chen: "People lose the Tao when they try to find it. They confuse existence with nonexistence. All we can do is cultivate "Te" (virtue, spiritual power). Te includes our spirit, mind, thoughts. True Te leads to true tao. But most people cultivate powers and thoughts, and they think they've realized the Tao. But they're wrong. To cultivate true Te is to get rid of all powers and thoughts, to be like a baby, to see without seeing. Tao comes naturally."And, finally, an encounter with Master Su (who Porter had wanted to meet for years). "...another monk came out of the tent. Chou said this was Master Su. I bowed and introduced myself. Without pausing, Su said I had the wrong man, that his name was Hua, as in Huashan. Then he walked off, flapping his long sleeves as if he were about to fly away." :)An interesting book. Well chosen history tidbits. Pearls amongst the ordinariness of casual encounters. I felt sad reading about the destruction of numberless temples by the Red Guards, about wanton cutting down of thousand year old sacred trees, book burnings, of systematic destruction of the noblest, most profound and deep wisdom of the Chinese people. In a few crazed & hysterical years the flower of Chinese spirit, architecture and people was cut. The few souls who survived are not in it for the glamor - they live difficult, hungry lives that are always in the danger of party cadres and, increasingly, tourist hordes channeled into the ancient temples by county tourist office. And yet the monks go on because they love meditation, solitude, the insights and the mountains.
