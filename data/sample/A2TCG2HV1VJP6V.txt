Pac-Man World showed that while people are now looking out for games with guns, explosions, and those other kind of things, there can still be a good game that doesn't need any of that. The sequel has shown the same thing.PMW2 plays a bit like the first game, but with several improvements. For instance, there's a fair difficulty now, and the camera angles are like how it usually would be in an average 3D game.The gameplay is really fun. You have what you had in the first PMW: Rev Roll in a Sonic-like way, Butt Bouncing, and hey, look! Now there's a mid-air flip kick! Pretty useful at times. Like the first game, the gameplay is about eating fruits, dots, and unlocking special mazes. Sometimes, the gameplay can vary when it comes to a certain level where it has to. Like in Blade Mountain, you have to skate through caves and jump up ramps (Like how it's shown on the boxart). In the water levels (except one), it's an on-rails shooter in which you shoot the enemies trying to attack.The mazes hidden in the game are as fun as the original Pac-Man arcade games. Although some are slight redesigns of old Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man mazes, new ones are also in the mix. You can also collect Namco tokens (which are also hidden) to be able to unlock the actual arcade games. If you go to Sue's Arcade in the Pac-Village, you can play the arcade games anytime you want after unlocking them. The games are: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, and Pac-Attack (The only console re-release not counting Virtual Console). You can also play the unlocked mazes there, too.The sound effects are just classic and action-y. The music is also really cool to listen to. B-Doing Woods has a really lively tune to it, and the water stages have a pretty dramatic theme in each.The graphics aren't exactly the best the Xbox has to offer, but they still look really good and the arcade games are replicated on-screen pixel by pixel.Overall, if you enjoyed the first Pac-Man World, you would NEED to play this one. Better yet, if you haven't played the first one, this is a great place to start, considering how it's released on multiple systems other than Sony's line of Playstation consoles.

The Mario movie may not have anything related to the games, but that's not what matter about it. What matters about it is that it's a good movie nonetheless.It is what some people call Mario on steroids. The Mario Bros venture through a cool-looking city, trying to go and rescue Princess Daisy from King Koopa, who is a human that descended from a T-Rex.How is that bad? It's cool!I mean, seriously. True, the cast seems a bit awkward, but that thought fades away once you see how tough Bob Hoskins makes Mario look. Ever wanted to hear Mario say "C'mon kid...we're going in"? Here you go.If you like action-adventure movies, this is one you should watch. Mario fans who want him to stay within the Mushroom Kingdom-y elements should back off.

Ducktales is one of the very few games that prove that even the shortest game can succeed. There's only 5 levels, and you repeat 1, but those 5 levels are lengthy.The plot is that Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world, wants to be even richer by traveling around the world, finding treasures.You can go to Transylvania, the Amazon, the Moon, the Himalayas, and the African Mines.Ducktales shares certain similarities to MegaMan, like the level selection, how the levels scroll when you fall, and how there's a boss at the end of every level. In fact, Capcom made this game.The game is a nice side-scrolling platformer with impressive graphics and upbeat Capcom sounds and music.

Stanley the Bugman's console debut was never as popular as Mario's starring in Donkey Kong and Jr, and for good reason.The game is a shooter in disguise as a limited platformer. The goal is to spray Donkey Kong up to the top of the vines he climbs with a bug sprayer, while also shooting distracting bugs that try to take away your flowers.When Stanley dies, he looks like as if he just died like how Mario does in Donkey Kong, but in the arcade version, that's not the case. In the original, bugs would swoop down, and eat off Stanley (Thankfully, there's no blood. His body just disappears) I can see why that was censored in the NES game.Unlike the first two games, Donkey Kong 3's levels are all identical, with just the color palliate changed.

Pinball simulations are pretty common nowadays, but back in 1995, whereas there were few, 3D Ultra Pinball was the game that remained golden in the Windows 95 market. Some years later, Thrillride makes the series's reputation even better.Unlike the other games, you only get to play one table, but that one table is extremely fun and there are multiple activities to do, like the Thrill Zone, a bonus area for smacking the ball against roller coasters, and the Fun Zone, where you hit a kissing tower and make it go up as high as possible.The graphics are amazing. The game looks and plays like real pinball. I also love the music. It is very catchy and fits well with the fast-paced and lighthearted action that's going on in-game. The voice clips may be cheesy, but everything else makes up for it.Things get extremely intense with the multiball (Of course), where you have to keep an eye on every onscreen ball as they fly off everywhere!But overall, this is a must-have for pinball fans. Don't miss out on it.

To start off this review, let me tell you that I bought Mortal Kombat 4 for the Game Boy before 3. It had lousy AI, good graphics, bland music, semi-unresponsive controls, and 3 difficulty modes: Novice, Warrior, and Master. But, it was good enough to get 3 stars.What I found to be strange was that Mortal Kombat 3 on the Game Boy had several similarities to 4. The only differences are: Different characters and setting, badder music, and the controls a bit more unresponsive. Everything else seems to be the same. It's not like it's a direct sequel, is it? I mean, the MegaMan series always had the same gameplay sequel after sequel. But I don't recall Mortal Kombat series having the almost exact same things.The graphics are good. The characters are digitized, like how they were in the previous games.The gameplay, however, can be unresponsive.Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats, this game would be short. You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode, 7 in Warrior, and 5 in Novice.The best attack to use is just kicking. That's kinda sad. Usually, the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use, but no. Instead, it's KICKING.However, even after all this, it would manage to have some appeal.Overall, it's alright, but if you want a great Mortal Kombat game for the Game Boy, buy MK2 instead.

Mortal Kombat 4 is the first 3D game of the series. Despite that, the Game Boy version is still 2D.The graphics are good. The characters are digitized, like how they were in the previous games.The gameplay, however, can be unresponsive.Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats, this game would be short. You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode, 7 in Warrior, and 5 in Novice.The best attack to use is just kicking. That's kinda sad. Usually, the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use, but no. Instead, it's KICKING.The enemy AI is way too easy to beat. I got through Master mode without any trouble. Granted, they can attack almost decently, but just throw 5 kicks and then it's possible he/she'd die. It can be glitchy when it comes to fighting Scorpion and Shinnok. You can still attack them even while they use their "Get over here" attacks on you. It doesn't look like you are, but then you see the enemy's HP draining. If you attack them by just mashing A repeatedly, and kill them, you somehow use your fatality.For some reason, I just manage to get addicted to this game. I don't know how, but I just ended up like that.There are a couple special stuff in the game when played on the Super Game Boy:-Special and cool-looking 16-Bit border-Colors change every screen to appropriate colorsWhen played on the Game Boy Color, the colors make very detailed backgrounds.Overall, buy MK2 instead.

Space Ghost has a strange history. There was an action-adventure animated series made during the 1960s, and in 1994, it's all reinvented into a crazy talk show starring the title character, along with enemy Zorak and Moltar. Unlike the 60s show, Coast to Coast is.....well....anything but that, even without the talk-show gimmick. Space Ghost is now a funnyman, and he's got Moltar and Zorak as his associates for the show (Zorak being SG's prisoner).The writing of the show is flat-out brilliant. There are great jokes in nearly every scene, and in many varieties. Some are clever. Some involve the special guest that's being interviewed by Space Ghost. Some involve Zorak arguing/his hatred for Space Ghost. Some involve Moltar speaking with Space Ghost or the guest. And...Some are just plain random! Humor flows through the show majorly. There's always material utilized for said humor, and I love the show for that..You'd be very surprised with the guests that come onto the show. From Matt Groening (Creator of Simpsons) to Craig McCracken (Creator of Powerpuff Girls) to Jon Stewart to Jim Carrey to Weird Al, there is a wide load of special guests that come onto the show...And some are definitely used for poking fun at.Another major thing in the show is that it uses recycled animation from the original 60s cartoon! Apparently, this just proves that the show can't be taken seriously. There happen to be some jokes that make fun of how the animation used. In one episode (The one with Zorak's nephew), Space Ghost reveals to own a horse, but you can't see the horse because it's either off-screen or is shown as a black screen with "Insert Horse" on it! And in another episode, Space Ghost tries to dance. The use of animation for his dancing scenes are so laughable!All in all, Space Ghost Coast to Coast is a really hilarious animated talk-show that's full of lighthearted laugh-out-loud moments and intentionally cheap animation. Definitely check it out!

Alright. I will admit: The show isn't the best out there. The design is so extremely wacky it's ridiculous at times. The animation could be said the same thing (Robotnik's head was sideways while he was running in one scene), but in the end, it's a cartoon show based off the popular Sega game series...and it's funny.While it can be pretty ridiculous, that's partly why it's humorous. You won't believe how weird the storylines are ("I created a robot to destroy all music!"), and you gotta love how Sonic actually disguises himself to trick Robotnik's two minions (Scratch and Grounder) most of the time. It's eye-rolling to see the situations Sonic and Tails could get into though sometimes, while other times, they are laughable.Did I forget to mention that Sonic has a moral to teach at the end of every episode? Even those are weird, but of course, we expect the usual messages as well.The show as a whole sounds really stupid, but you know what? It could appeal to many in a strange, but fun way.It's ENJOYABLY stupid. And that's why I love this more than the Super Mario Bros Super Show.Besides, with a company like Sega and Sonic voiced by the likes of Jaleel White (Urkel from Family Matters), the show has great production value.

Rayman 2. If that rings a bell, then you must have remembered the game that was released for the Nintendo 64, the Sega Dreamcast, the PC, and the Playstation. That game was known as one of the greatest 3D platformers of all time. Some of you, however, may recall the Game Boy Color game of the same name. Is it a good game? Well, let me tell you.Rayman 2, of course, is a 3D platformer, right? So how does that translate to the Game Boy Color? Ubisoft reimagines the game as a 2D platformer, and builds it off of the first Rayman game, also released on Game Boy Color (But it was originally for Playstation, Atari Jaguar, and PC).Given that statement, Rayman 2 looks and plays like its predecessor, and that isn't a bad thing. That means Rayman can still throw his fists at enemies, and he can still bust cages open and fly with his hair for a short period of time.However, it is set in the same storyline and setting as the console and computer game. The levels are also based on the original's huge levels, in which there's a lot to explore in most cases. While most of the levels are big, though, it's quite obvious that the game itself isn't as big as the N64/SD/PC/PS1 game. I mean, it IS a Game Boy (Color) game.Sometimes, there isn't really a challenge in the levels, because you may not find a lot of enemies. Fortunately, as some games do so, the game does indeed get harder as you progress through. Soon, you'll encounter spikes, more enemies, and tricky pathways.The entire game is just a lot of fun, and I recommend you to purchase it.

Okay, so it IS flawed. There's no multiplayer (A must for beat 'em ups), and a whole level + character's been taken out, too. But you still gotta play this. Since this game is by Capcom, you're sure to find that this is an awesome Super NES gem.Final Fight is the one that started a whole craze of games that played similarly to it. The button-mashing knuckle-crunching coolness shines throughout the game from start to finish. It's extremely addicting, and in case you think it would get repetitive, chances are you will find an item that can help you beat up all the goons in the level.The graphics are downright amazing. The sprites are all very large-scale, making it easy to appeal to the eye. The music and sound effects are also realistic and catchy, just like how Capcom would always make them.In a nutshell: Go out to a flea market or something, or maybe buy it online here, and you won't be disappointed whatsoever (Although the difficulty can be somewhat tough).

Well, as you may expect, I am watching this in school with the rest of the class. Romeo and Juliet was definitely a timeless story, but this modern-day adaptation took it to the most unbelievable heights! In this version of the classic, it's all set in pure modern-day, complete with television, beaches, cars, buildings, etc. And guess what? The characters still speak in Shakespearean English! This makes a really hilarious impact upon the film! They even call the guns "swords", since the guns are manufactured by a fictional company named Sword, so you can easily tell that the laughs you got from all this were intentional.Not all is undramatic, though. After all, Romeo and Juliet IS a tragic play. The movie still captured that tragic image, as characters grew pretty emotional during scenes from Mercutio's death to beyond. In fact, I'm actually kinda annoyed by some scenes. You see, said scenes are way, WAY more emotional than they need to be. For example, when Juliet refuses to marry Paris even after Romeo's banished, she and Capulet push each other around during an overly heated argument (Juliet cries this whole time while trying to talk back). I really would've just preferred an angry argument. And after that, when Juliet goes to Friar Lawrence, there's another conversation, but she was STILL sobbing, and even held a gun to her head for a brief moment! This is just too much...But aside from scenes like those, this is a very fresh take on Romeo and Juliet. It's really funny to see the characters re-imagined in this modern-day world. I bet that after footage was taken, the actors were laughing for quite some time, considering what they had just spoken to each other (The acting itself is actually very top-notch, if not a little overboard, like what I described above).

Mario Bros was an awesome arcade game back in the day, and it still holds up well today.The NES version plays, looks, and sounds like the original, only with minor edits.As Mario, you just hit enemies from underneath, and then kick 'em off! Oh, and grab the coins, too.Things are especially fun in 2-player mode, in which the other player plays as Luigi.Overall, this game can't be missed by any Mario fan.

You'd probably mistake this as just another regular cartridge port of Ms. Pac-Man, but if you did, then you couldn't be more wrong.The sounds are taken straight from the arcade game.The graphics are actually made more detailed than how the arcade game's graphics are.Now, for the gameplay, there's a lot to talk about. Right after the title screen, there's tons of options to choose from:-Players: 1, 2 (Co-op), 2 (Competitive), 2 (Alternative)-Difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard, Crazy-Pac-Booster: On, off (I ALWAYS choose On for this one. What can beat fast Ms. Pac-Man?)-Maze Selection (My favorite option): Arcade, Mini, Big, StrangeYou can alter the game with all of those options! The main gameplay is pure Ms. Pac-Man awesomeness.You can't beat that!Unfortunately, this game has been overlooked due to the fact that this version was released the same year as the Nintendo 64.

It seems like everyone's getting into the pinball craze when this was released. Mario romps through a Mario 64-esc adveture being bounced around by flippers, and even Metroid Prime, a FPS series, enters the pinball table on DS. And now, we get a Pac-Man Pinball game.Pac-Man Pinball Advance looks like it has a storyline behind it. When you start playing, there's an intro scene with Professor Pac warning Pac-Man about what had happened. However, this is straight-up pinball that doesn't head toward the direction Mario Pinball Land did.There are 2 tables, each with 2 different styles. They also differ in obstacles, offering a bit of variety. Of course, when playing a table, Pac-Man elements would be thrown into the scene. You can eat dots, chase after ghosts, collect fruit, etc. It plays pretty well.I'm not sure if this is really a must-have, though. After all, dare I say it again, Mario Pinball Land is a whole adventure game in pinball form, and it's on the same system. But then again, this game has better controls. Whatever the decision may be, you can't doubt that today's price for this game is unbeatable. You may as well get both games.

This could have been any kind of game, really. It could have been a platformer with the license stapled onto it. But nope. Instead, the developers have taken a more minigame-based approach with said minigames being based off of classic Stooges films! This was what had me curious. And the game itself was certainly no disappointment.The game involves the Stooges attempting to save an orphanage (Is this where the recent movie had its storyline from?) by getting $5000 dollars. More important than that, it has you participate in a cracker-eating contest, get jobs as doctors or waiters (Pie fight!), etc. All of which are definitely based on Stooges films. However, to play a certain minigame, you have to select one in a Roulette-ish fashion. Do not select the mousetraps!Although there's sort of a limited number of minigames to play, there is also a trivia game (For hardcore fans only) as well as a chance for Moe to beat the heck out of the other 2 Stooges in that same humorous style as in the original series. There would also be an opportunity to collect bonus money.Even if you hadn't checked out how the game plays, the mere presentation would totally appeal to you. The first thing that happens on-screen is that the game happens to have a title screen for "Ghostbusters 2". Then the Stooges come, and Curly says "Hey! We've got the wrong name!" I cracked up when I saw that! Not to mention, the game throughout has neat comedy bits to stay faithful to the series. On top of that, the graphics are some of the best you'd see on NES, and the good amount of voice samples is shocking. The music isn't too top-notch, but it wasn't bad either.Overall, if you are a Three Stooges fan, or if you like games such as Mario Party, this game is one to try out.

A couple years back, in 7th grade, during History class, everyone in the classroom was introduced to one of entertainment's greatest stars, Charlie Chaplin. And how did we become aware of this man's works? By watching Modern Times. After watching the movie, I must say that it is one of the FUNNIEST movies I've EVER seen in my life! In fact, I think I've gotten the most enjoyment out of the film than anyone else in the classroom. Why haven't I seen this earlier?Honestly, I don't think there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but I still highly recommend this movie. Not only is it extremely wonderful and hilarious, but it is also one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, too. Think about it: Can we students imagine what the 1930s were like, let alone Little Tramp's world? It would be pretty bizarre to visualize ourselves force-fed by a "feeding machine", as well as TRY to get arrested by doing ridiculous things!You can just watch a few clips of the movie before buying a disc, or you could go and see the other Amazon reviews for further detail about this classic. Either way, there's no doubting that you're in for a great time while it lasts.

Pac-Man World 3 differed quite a lot from the previous games in the series, but it's still a very fun game. However, it featured a lot of content. The environments were huge and the levels were long. There were loads of cutscenes and dialogue with a clever sense of humor. Not to mention, there's a museum complete with collectible cards, the classic Pac-Man game, and there are Galaxians scattered around levels that allow you to play techno-esc mazes. How will the DS respond?Well...It doesn't carry any of the new mazes or the classic Pac-Man. Instead, there's a "VR Maze" as an extra, and it's actually the original Pac-Man's maze, but you can only play it once before "YOU WIN!" pops up. The other extra is the interview with the creator of Pac-Man, but apparently, it's not a video. It's made of still pictures FROM THE VIDEO. The DS can handle video, people! Use that for your advantage, developers!Despite the poor presentation (Although the title screen looked pretty awesome), this is actually a faithful port of the console game. However, certain elements have been simplified, and some enemies take less hits. The levels end rather abruptly too. There's also no dialogue or cutscenes, and if you press a switch, the camera doesn't pan over to see what was being affected by the switch, so you have to figure out for yourself. Speaking of which, the camera could use work.Underneath the flaws, though, the game is pretty intact. The levels are large and the environments are detailed, and the fun gameplay is there. In case you haven't already known about what PMW3 has to offer, you still have Pac-Man's Butt-Bounce and Rev Roll moves from the past two games, but now you can punch, and perform combos with the Butt-Bounce. There are also different kinds of Power Pellets that give you a certain power. Oh, yes. And you can Wall Jump.But even though I really like getting the chance to play a mostly intact PMW3 on the go, the flaws within the game prevent this from being a 5-star title. Personally, the problems don't affect my experience by THAT much, but I still feel like they shouldn't have existed in the first place. For example, Namco could have just made the "VR Maze" repeat so that way it's like arcade Pac-Man. Heck, why not just replace that overall with the actual Pac-Man game? And why the heck can't the game simply tell me where to go after I press a switch that affects another part of the level?But overall, this is a solid game. If you want to play Pac-Man World 3 on the go, this is definitely for you. However, for a top-notch DS adventure, I would rather prefer you buy Super Mario 64 DS, or the 2D Sonic titles released for the system.

Donkey Kong, a smash hit in the arcades, got a Game Boy version that improved over the original by a lot. It was no wonder it sold so well back then. 10 years later, Mario Vs Donkey Kong comes in as a sequel to that Game Boy classic. Of course, since it's a sequel, it would have the same gameplay as Donkey Kong.The main gameplay has Mario go fetch a key and then use the key to open up a locked door to move on. The levels are clever, fun to play, and just downright cool. In fact, Mario can use acrobatic skills to help him through the levels. He can somersault, flip, and perform handstand jumps.This game includes all new levels, enemies, and puzzles. There are also some elements that were fixed or renewed from Donkey Kong, such as adding hit points in the bosses, and a counter for when the key will disappear.In every world, before the boss, there's a level where you need to lead the Mini Marios into a toy chest. Of course, you must progress skillfully through the level to get to the chest.After beating the last world (World 6), there are now 6 more worlds named Plus worlds, in which you must guide the Mini Mario (cleverly) to the door. If the Mini Mario dies, so do you. There are also several unlockable Expert levels that you can access by getting stars in the regular levels.Overall, it's a challenging successor to an update of the classic arcade game that started everything Mario.

The Game Boy was a pretty awesome handheld system. It took what made the Nintendo Entertainment System so great, and carried it on the go. However, if there was one thing that seemed laughable at first, it was the lack of color. The Game Boy's screen was all monochrome. However, the guys at SEGA decided to fix that by facing Nintendo on the road with the Game Gear.The Game Gear is a full-color handheld featuring a large library of games, from originals to handheld versions of console games. Want to play portable Sonic? There's fresh takes on Sonics 1 & 2, as well as new titles such as Sonic Chaos, Sonic Triple Trouble, and Sonic Blast. The system hosts a colorful library of many classic franchises, such as...-Double Dragon-Mortal Kombat-Mega Man-Battletoads-Ninja Gaiden-Shinobi-Super Off-Road-Smash TVAnd SOOOO much more!However, although the amount of fun games on there is decent, the system itself has a couple of major flaws. For one thing, it takes 6 batteries compared to the Game Boy's 4, and it dies out within a couple hours, so you always need an AC Adapter for it. Plus, while the game library is good, it kinda lacks the extra spark the Game Boy had when it came to third-party titles. Capcom made Mega Mans 1 through 5 on there! Konami made quality Castlevania, Contra, and TMNT games!Nevertheless, the Game Gear is definitely worth a look.

What a very surprising release. You would think that Frogger would go under a transition with updated graphics and sounds as it heads to the 16-Bit Sega Genesis. But NOPE! It's that exact same arcade classic that you may have grown up with playing at the arcades! From my knowledge, no other game on the Sega Genesis has ever been a direct port of an 80s game (Other than Action 52's version of Pong, but that's an unlicensed game).While it is a direct port to the Genesis, the traffic-dodging gameplay, the retrospective graphics, and the catchy tunes still hold up today. It's hard to dislike the game, considering the gameplay is just as addicting as when it was an arcade machine, even though this version was released in the late 90s (As late as 1998, in fact).If you didn't like the Super Nintendo because it didn't have the nostalgia or charming aspects that you expected, then come on down to here, where you get the real deal. Better yet, if you like the classic Frogger at all, you need to buy this.

It's the year 1995 (Don't worry. This can run on newer computers, though you need to change the game file's compatibility setting). The Windows 95 computer was highly talked about, and there were already loads of disks and games for it on store shelves. One of those games is 3D Ultra Pinball: Fastest Pinball in Space. It was part of (obviously) the 3D Ultra Pinball series by Sierra.The game is composed of 3 space or future-themed pinball tables. The tables don't really have any major gimmicks, but they play fine. The pinball physics are pretty realistic, making the game a good experience for those who play actual pinball machines. You can also choose to play with up to 4 players.While it does offer decent fun, I did state that there are no special gimmicks that make the tables play any different from each other other than how they are laid out. The best part of the game is what happens when you enter a tunnel in a table. You can choose from different bonuses, as well as being able to go to a different table (Though the latter happens in "Play All" only)!

The Intellivision has some good games going for it. I've played these in the Intellivision Classics compilation for the Playstation. Sharp Shot is one of them. It kinda acts as one of the first game collections ever, since it has simplified versions of 4 different games. However, the one-button premise makes them have a bit of the same gameplay. That bit is timing.The goal is to get the highest score as possible within under one minute of play. In Football, you have to pass the ball to your teamate to get touchdowns. 7 points per touchdown. The version of Space Battle has you kill enemy ships for points. Sea Battle also has you shoot off ships, but, of course, in naval combat. The last game, Dungeons and Dragons, lets you, once again, shoot enemies, but this time, the arrows you shoot bounce off parts off the walls surrounding it.It all matters about timing, but that is what makes it so addicting. It's a pretty great addition to the Intellivision's library.

Mario Clash isn't like any main Mario title, but it sure is as fun as any Mario game can be, even when it comes to being available for a system that's rumored to hurt your eyes badly.Basically, it's like the arcade game Mario Bros, but with a new gimmick in which you can stomp Koopas and throw their shells towards or far back away from the screen to kill enemies. You can also throw them left or right. This actually makes for even more interesting action that Mario Bros seems to be somewhat missing.The variety of enemies isn't bad, either. Along with the standard walking Koopas and Spinies, you now have hopping enemies, as well as ghosts. Like the shell bashing, it adds to the already addicting arcade-style platforming formula. Oh, yes. Did I forget to mention that the game is endless, just like Mario Bros? Sorry, I just can't get anywhere without comparing it to that game.But if you enjoy playing games with that kind of 80s arcade gameplay, and if you're not afraid of the Virtual Boy's rumors, definitely try and pick this up.

Mario Bros is an awesome arcade game. It stars Mario and Luigi and shows that they are really plumbers.The Atari 2600 version plays just as great, but the graphics and sounds are obviously....Atari-ed.As Mario, you just hit enemies from underneath, and then kick 'em off! Oh, and grab the coins, too.Things are especially fun in 2-player mode, in which the other player plays as Luigi.Overall, this game can't be missed by any Mario fan.

Really, I first read Nintendo Power since 2004. I decided to buy this issue to see what it would be like. I was very curious. When it arrived in the mail, I had opened the magazine and started looking at the pages. It was not your average modern-day issue. It highlighted several Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Game Boy, and Super NES games. The most notable being ActRaiser, Batman: Return of the Joker, and Metroid II.As I read the Player's Pulse, I was shocked to see that Nintendo didn't seem to respond to most of the letters. Only 2 out of the 8 letters shown in the Pulse. Half of the Pulse answers a question that the staff had asked the readers. This issue had the most interesting answers of what their ultimate video game systems would be like. The first letter was incredibly shocking. Here's the part of the letter that had me shocked: "What game would come with the system, you ask: Super Mario Galaxy, better known as Super Mario Bros 24!" 16 years after this issue, the game of that same name came out. The reader must be surprised himself.After the Pulse is an article on Return of the Joker. It shows the level maps, tips on playing the game, etc. Already, you can find a review score on the first page of the article. You know what reviewing is for right? Recommending the game for you and stuff. Today, Nintendo Power would put every review at the near-end of the issues. This issue does the same also, but some articles show the scores.After the Batman article is a Nester comic. Nester is a former mascot of Nintendo Power that stars in comics that are based on an upcoming game. This issue's comic is based on the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy. I like the comic. It's just plain funny.Now here's an article called Classified Information. It explains more tricks and tips that can be performed in certain games. The games shown are: The Simpsons (NES games), Battletoads, Whomp 'Em, Laser Invasion, and Super Mario World. It's funny how one of the tips for the Simpsons NES game (Bart vs the Space Mutants) just tells what the second stage is like.Next is an article of ActRaiser, a platform/simulation game for the Super Nintendo. Too bad the review score for the game isn't shown here.Counselors' Corner asks and answers certain questions about certain games. By now, some of us should probably already know where the secret exit from Cheese Bridge (in Super Mario World) is. In case you don't know, go ahead and start reading about it here.Now here's an article of the Addams Family game. The review score is shown, unlike the ActRaiser article.Right after the Addams Family article is a article of Tiny Toon Adventures. Review score, shown as expected.Yet another article shown, but this time, it highlights Metroid II. Since I own the game, I swear, this really helped me. The maps shown and stuff, they really guided me out of my situations in the game. No score.Ooh! A Ninja Gaiden Shadow article! No score.Adventure Island. A game starring a guy wearing a leaf skirt and a hat. No score.Now here's another Classified page. For some reason, it's separate from the Classified Information section. It gives tips on....Game Boy games. Here, I see Castlevania II (Game Boy) and Spanky's Quest tips. Never had I known there was a Game Boy version of Castlevania II.All on one page, this page has a Now Playing (Reviews) section, a list of upcoming Game Boy games, and a Top 10 Game Boy game list. Coming Soon: Star Trek, Gradius: Interstellar Assault, and the Addams Family. Now for the Top 10.1. Super Mario Land2. TMNT: Fall of the Foot Clan3. Dr. Mario4. F-1 Race5. Final Fantasy Legend6. Castlevania: The Adventure7. Operation C (A Contra game)8. Batman9. Sword of Hope10. Gargoyle's QuestNow here's an article of Pilotwings. To think that there's gonna be a new Pilotwings game coming out for the 3DS. No score.Cool! 2 pages of Game Boy designs. The Ultimate Game Boy Design Contest has ended and I am looking at the winners' and runners-up' designs. One is based off of the King of Diamonds card (You know. Just cards). One design is dull. It's a white Game Boy with the screen border being an American flag. In between the buttons read "All American Game Boy". It's funny, but the whole design just isn't all that great. One of the winners show some kind of a Nintendo jungle pyramid. That's cool.Now here is a contest (That you can't even enter now) that has a Star Wars tour as a grand prize. The second prize is a mask of a Star Wars villain or hero, and a NES game. Third prize is a Nintendo Power jersey.Right here is a Now Playing (Reviews) section for NES and Super NES games. The games being reviewed here are TaleSpin, Golf Grand Slam, Kung Fu II, Home Alone, Paperboy 2, and Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball. When I saw Home Alone's score, I got confused. Were they reviewing the NES or Super NES version of the game? I assume the Super NES.NES Achievers is the worst section. It just shows players' high scores on some games. Showoffs.Now here is a list of the Top 30 selling NES games. I'll only show the Top 10 for this review.1. Super Mario Bros. 3 (Cool!)2. TMNT II: The Arcade Game (Also cool!)3. Final Fantasy4. Battletoads5. Crystalis6. Dragon Warrior II7. MegaMan III (Hard, but okay)8. Bart vs the Space Mutants (WHAT?!)9. Tetris10. Super Mario Bros 2Next is a Celebrity Profile page. For some reason, they highlight a celebrity that had an experience with video games. In this case, Mayim Bailik, from TV's "Blossom".Pak Watch highlights games that are about to be released soon.The next page shows 3 things. One mini-article highlighting the Nintendo Super System arcade cabinet. I find it pointless. I don't recall any arcade ever having a Super System or a Playchoice-10 arcade machine. Below it is a mini-article on Super Battletank. Below that shows an announcement of what is probably TMNT IV: Turtles in Time for Super Nintendo.And that is the whole issue. I hope I gave you a nice image of what it might be like. However, you can't fully experience it without buying the Power....Nintendo Power!

Yoshi's Island was terrific on the Super Nintendo. It stroke back again on the Game Boy Advance. And now, we get....what seems like a minigame of the Yoshi games.Yoshi Touch & Go has a variety of game modes. The one I always play is Marathon.The graphics are great for the DS handheld.The sounds are superb too.As for the gameplay...In a normal game mode, Baby Mario would fall from the sky. As he floats down (He's attached to balloons), you must draw clouds to guide him from being attacked by the enemies in the air.The usual gameplay for this game is you playing as Yoshi. He automatically runs, and you must tap anywhere in the air to throw eggs in those directions. Tapping Yoshi would make him jump. Tapping him in the air would make him keep jumping. You must try not to get hit by the enemies or anything. Just try to make your way through the level without dying. Otherwise, it's Game Over.There's also a VS Mode, in which you play this game with a friend.The game is fun and all, but it probably won't have enough for you to satisfy yourself with, depending on whether you like arcade-style games or not.

In a time where the Internet is being seen by several people, and consoles try to take advantage of it, and those consoles would run on CDs, the Nintendo 64 had arrived into the scene. It didn't run on CDs, but cartridges. It had no online support whatsoever. But you know what? It sold well.Nintendo had, once again, revolutionized the gaming industry with their move of making the Nintendo 64. How? Because of Super Mario 64, one of the first games for the system.Having 4 players instead of 2 add up to the fun that you would probably have when playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Mario Party, and Goldeneye 007.

It is the year 2001. SEGA's console department was falling apart. The Dreamcast was pretty awesome, but when it came down to the Nintendo 64, Playstation 1 & 2, and the Xbox all together, it seems like SEGA couldn't keep up with them, as the company began to turn into a third-party developer/publisher. So what do they do? THEY MAKE A SONIC GAME ON THE NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE (With publishing help from THQ)! How cool is that?! Sonic has arrived onto a Nintendo system! Sure, Sonic Adventure 2 on the Gamecube may have technically been his Nintendo debut for us, but Sonic Advance was a whole new game. And even better: It was 2D Sonic fun.Sonic Advance featured what made the Sega Genesis games so great and added a much faster pace to it. Fortunately, that did not ruin the flow of the game's oh-so-great platforming. In fact, the level design itself is flat-out brilliant, as it's generally multilayered, allowing Sonic and co. to travel through many different pathways. There's also a lot of variety of obstacles and enemies, some of which are exclusive to the environments the levels take place in (Such as casino pinball flippers, ziplines, etc), keeping the game fresh and fun.Being able to play as different characters also adds to what you can do in the game. For example, Sonic can somersault and perform a move in which a flash shaped like lightning will cover Sonic for a split second (a la Sonic 3 & Knuckles). Tails can fly and attack with his....tails. Knuckles can climb, glide, and punch. Lastly, Amy uses her hammer to attack. All of what the characters can do affect gameplay within the game and could possibly make things more satisfying to the player. For example, reaching areas with Tails or Knuckles could make the game a bit easier, but not to the point where the whole game's a cakewalk.All in all, Sonic Advance is awesome! Definitely get it for your Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS (Lite). The mobile version is also pretty neat, but some levels have been cut from that version, so it's best if you get yourself a copy of the game for the GBA or DS.

The Game Boy Advance is one of the best handheld systems out there. I know people are rather concentrated on the DS line of systems now, but don't forget this: The Game Boy is what started everything (Or is it the Game & Watch...?). If you own a Nintendo Gamecube, you need to get this thing.The Game Boy Player works a lot like the Super Game Boy for the Super Nintendo. It is compatible with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but it also has compatibility with all of your Game Boy Advance games. That is pretty cool already.So you pop in the game, and you just play with your Gamecube controller. Portability is really awesome, but sometimes, there's nothing like playing a game with a controller in your hand.If you play a Game Boy game that has a Super Game Boy symbol on it, let me tell you right now, that the Super Game Boy features won't show on the Game Boy Player. Instead, you play the game as it was on the original green-and-white screened system (with GBC colors).You know what I think would be a bit funny. Playing a GBA version of a game, that's on the Gamecube, on the Game Boy Player. It just seems a bit funny in a way. Playing Pac-Man World 2 or WarioWare Inc on the Game Boy Player. How amusing...in fact, you can just make the same thing happen with the Super Game Boy. Play a Game Boy game that was also released on the Super Nintendo with the Super Game Boy.The Super Game Boy menu is not present in the Game Boy Player, but there are some options to choose from.If you are playing a Game Boy game with a gyro sensor, you can't use the controllers to play them (Although pressing the buttons are required). Instead, you have to TILT THE GAMECUBE ITSELF! How messed up is that?! Try to play WarioWare Twisted with a Gamecube in your lap!Overall, the Game Boy Player is a must-have.

Note: This review is going to be short, since there isn't really much to say about the game.Cruis'n USA isn't actually as bad the averaged out Amazon rating says. There's some good arcade-style racing here. You may not be interested in this category if you like games like Mario Kart, but it's still a pretty good game. Granted, there are some pretty cheesy things that have been said in-game ("Wow, so THIS is the Grand Canyon!"), but you can get used to that easily.Another thing that some may complain about is that the game is short. You can beat the game in a little less than a half hour. But I don't care about how long a game is. It just needs to fit with its price...and boy, do you have a chance of buying a used copy for a few bucks.The game is like Rad Racer on the NES, but 10 times better. If you like games that are similar to Rad Racer, Ridge Racer, or maybe Need for Speed, then Cruis'n USA is definitely something to buy.

Triple Trouble, to me, is kind of like a Game Gear equivalent to Sonic 3 for the Genesis. Like Sonic Chaos, you get to play as either Sonic or Tails (I actually prefer the latter). Like a 2D Sonic game, you go through several zones, destroy the bosses at the end, and defeat Dr. Robotnik and demolish his evil plans.The game borrows stuff from Sonic 3 and Sonic CD. Sonic can do the peel-out dash, and Tails can fly for a certain time.Overall, it's your average classic Sonic game for that competitor of the Game Boy.

(REDONE ON 12/22/2012)The original Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis was, and always will be an all-time classic. However, who would've thought that Sonic would be so much fun on the 8-Bit Game Gear? As technically limited as the Game Gear was, Sonic was reworked to be a perfect fit for the handheld. The result was significantly different than the Genesis hit, but was nevertheless a great game.Players were treated to a pretty good variety of levels. We've got Green Hill Zone like in the original, but now Bridge Zone and Jungle Zone come to replace the Marble and Spring Yard Zones. Honestly, I prefer those zones over Marble and Spring Yard. They are just so much more fun to roam through (Although this game could've gone just fine without an autoscrolling level). There's also Sky Base Zone, which takes place after Scrap Brain Zone. It serves as an all-new challenge that Sonic enthusiasts need to triumph over to deal with Robotnik for the last time (Until a sequel comes around and then we'll have to beat him again)!The graphics look gorgeous on the Game Gear, and while it certainly can't beat the Genesis's graphics capabilities, they still look lovely and well-detailed.The music is arguably catchier in this version of Sonic, though. The all-new zones had really lively and upbeat tunes that just sounded so much better than the zones they replaced. Not to mention, the old zones that still exist on here (aside from Green Hill) have their tracks redone for the better!So how exactly does the game PLAY? After all, that IS the most important aspect in a video game. Well, it doesn't pack any loop-de-loops, nor the many multiple paths, or even the ability to recollect the Rings you dropped after being attacked, but it does offer plenty of the enemy-pouncing and Ring-collecting that we also adore so much in the original game. Plus, the Zones help affect certain elements of gameplay. Green Hill contains slopes, Bridge Zone features crumbling platforms (and autoscrolling in the second Act), Jungle Zone has some platforms being eroded by the waterfalls, as well as running on logs, and a level in which Sonic must keep going up and up and not fall down whatsoever (The bottom of the screen kills you), ETC. The game is not afraid to introduce players to new game mechanics as they advance through the levels, and it is all the more satisfying for doing so.One hook to the game is that there are 6 Chaos Emeralds Sonic has to collect in order for the player to access the game's "Good Ending". Where do you find these Emeralds? Well, apparently, you don't go into the Special Stages this time around to find them (Although the newly revamped Special Stages present here are pretty rad, and you can earn extra lives/continues in them), but rather do you go look IN THE LEVELS THEMSELVES. Yup, that's right. Exploration still manages to be a key element, but this time, for finding Chaos Emeralds! This quest for the Good Ending is nice way to add replay value.Overall, Sonic's portable debut is a pretty awesome game. Definitely pick this one up if you can!If you don't have a Game Gear, you're not out of luck - It's available on Sonic Adventure DX (as an unlockable game), Sonic Mega Collection Plus, and the Sega Master System version (Which is the same game with a few small differences) is on the Wii Virtual Console!

While Sonic 1 for Game Gear was a good game, it didn't have much of the high-speed action we expected. Sonic 2, on the other hand, contains that.Sonic 2 for Game Gear is not what you expect to be if you had played the Genesis version: It has a completely different storyline and zones. Tails is kidnapped by Robotnik and Sonic must save him. Isn't Tails supposed to be the sidekick?Anyways, the gameplay is identical to the Genesis games, which is great. The music and sounds were still well-developed. What is kind of a letdown is that there are no Special Stages. You gotta find the Chaos Emeralds in the zones themselves. There's your challenge for ya.Overall, it's another great Sonic game....that was eclipsed by the more well-known Genesis version.

The 16-Bit wars were somewhat over when this game came about. The Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn were already coming under way, and the Playstation already bashed into the competition. The 8-Bit handhelds, however, were still duking it out and not one was replaced yet.Sonic Blast, given the mid-90s release, was trying to take advantage of pre-rendered 3D graphics, while also providing the same fast-paced 2D action that the series was known for best.The game plays a lot like Sonic Chaos and Sonic Triple Trouble. The improvements here are the double-jumping, the inclusion of Knuckles as a playable character, and entirely new level layouts, enemies, and bosses. Sonic Blast is exactly as fun as those games. The level designs are neat, the sounds are good, and the graphics are downright cool, considering the fact that this game is for an 8-Bit system.There are also Special Stages, but they aren't really so great. They are easy and boring.The game is also short, too, but I wouldn't actually care. Even short games are awesome, including DuckTales, Star Fox, and Super Mario Land, to name a few.

The Game Gear isn't exactly my personal recommendation for a video game system, but it still has a decent library of games. It just doesn't have as much charming titles as its competitor, the Game Boy, offered. Sonic Drift 2, according to the average Sonic fans, is one of the rather questionable games that came out of the system. You play as Sonic and friends as they....race...through certain zones..in cars.The game plays like Namco's arcade classic, Pole Position, but with Mario Kart-style elements, such as items. The items you get from the boxes either slow someone down, speed you up, or make you bounce.The game features Quick Race mode, Multiplayer Vs, and Grand Prix (with 5 tracks per cup). The tracks may be based off of certain zones in the Genesis Sonic games, but it surely doesn't differ too much from one other. Sure the maps are different, and the theme is, too, but that's it. Mystic Cave Zone is an exception, as it contains a few tunnels. Those tunnels, however, are frustrating because you are pushed to the very edge of the screen.Overall, it's Pole Position with a nice Sonic flavor, but also with a lack of variety.

Mortal Kombat II was always known as the pinnacle of the long-running series (To think Mortal Kombat 9 is coming). While MK2 dominated arcades and home consoles once again, the question is: Did it do well on Game Gear? It wasn't probably sold as much as the game's console cousins, but the game was actually pretty good.In fact, it's a lot like the Game Boy version. They both have the same layouts, the same menus, and even a bit of the same gameplay. The Game Boy version goes at a smoother pace, though. The Game Gear version does have blood, too, if that adds to your appeal.You choose your character (out of 8) and fight 10 other fighters, each with their own abilities. This goes for all of the Mortal Kombat games (Not in these specific #s though). The gameplay is pure arcade fighting on the go. The graphics are awesome, and the sounds/music were great.The downside, however, is the fact that there are only a few arenas in this port, and their background musics are swapped. Plus, the game could be beaten in about 10 minutes or so. But, is it worth replaying? Yes. It truly is.

Sonic Mega Collection is a major compilation of some of the greater Genesis titles. Those games include:-Sonic 1: The first game that all Sonic fans should have played by now. It's still extremely fun.-Sonic 2: What many consider to be the best Sonic game of all time (Though I prefer Sonic CD).-Sonic 3: What some others may say is the best Sonic game of all time....-Sonic and Knuckles: A continuation of Sonic 3.-Sonic Spinball: A neat pinball spin-off.-Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine: A cool Puyo Puyo-based puzzler based off the Adventures of Sonic cartoon show.-Sonic 3D Blast: A nice take on Flicky and the Sonic series.-Knuckles in Sonic 2 (unlockable): Self-explanatory.-Sonic 3 & Knuckles (unlockable): The combination of Sonic 3...and Knuckles...-Blue Sphere (unlockable): A standalone version of the Sonic 3 & Knuckles special stages.-Flicky (unlockable): A Sega arcade game in which you collect birds and guide them to the exit.-Ritistar (unlockable): A platformer starring a lesser-known character that isn't from the Sonic series.Given the amount of games in this package, you probably wouldn't get bored for a long time, especially if you are a Sonic fan. Get this collection if you don't own a Genesis, if you're a Sonic fan, or you just don't feel like buying cartridges.

Mortal Kombat is a totally cool fighting game series. Digitized and bloody fighting combined with neck-breaking, spine-ripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold. But I personally find the transition from 2D to 3D for this series scary at first glance. I originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes. However, I ended up sticking with it.In Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily.The gameplay is traditional Mortal Kombat fighting action. There are also some new moves, such as twisting someone's leg.The graphics are also really great, especially considering some of the Nintendo 64's limits, such as the 2D blood during the Game Over screen.And of course, the sound is top-notch.There are very few fighting games for the Nintendo 64, and this is your saving grace for your virtual strength.

The modern USB replica controllers are really cool and all, but if you want to stick with your original controller, then you might as well buy this.If you want to use this thing on NES, Master System, arcade emulators, etc, buy this.It'll let you experience ROMs in the true NES experience.

Namco Museum has been hogged with by Playstation for 5 volumes. It was time for the series to come to Nintendo.This compilation contains 6 arcade classics: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Pole Position, and Dig Dug. Each one of them has simple gameplay, but it can easily become addicting.However, you might overlook this for the more popular N64 games, such as Super Mario 64, but overall, it's a pretty good collection.

As the first actual spin-off of the Sonic titles, Sonic Spinball certainly tries to go above and beyond with the pinball genre. After all, we have seen Sonic bounce around in pinball-ish areas in the Casino Night Zone, right? It seems like some of that action was the reason why Sonic Spinball came to be.The gameplay is pretty neat. Sonic plays a role of a ball and you gotta bounce him around into areas to progress and complete tasks. You can even influence Sonic's movement a little bit. Of course, there's also ring-collecting and badnik-bashing on the way. There are 4 pretty big pinball tables; each with their own gimmicks. You also have to collect the Chaos Emeralds that can be found within the tables.Honestly, it isn't really as compelling as it may sound. While it can be fun, it's not easy being able to get Sonic/the ball to go where you want him to. After all, this is still pinball. There will be a lot of bouncing Sonic around before actually reaching your destination, making it seem like a chore at times.

Well, while I'm waiting to buy a copy Sonic Rush Adventure (Why didn't I think about getting it before?), I think I'll just review another Sonic game collection, and I must say, this is one heck of a collection! Sonic Mega Collection Plus contains a HUGE chunk of games from Sonic's past, and even has 3 non-Sonic-related games for some reason (Comix Zone, The Ooze, Ristar)! Let's take a brief look at each game shall we?==SEGA GENESIS GAMES==Sonic the Hedgehog - It's only the first Sonic game, yet it's one of the best platformers of its time!Sonic 2 - It's a sequel done right in the best ways possible! It's the 3rd best Sonic game ever, in my book.Sonic 3 - Although I prefer 2 over 3, the game is still tons of fun, and it just pushes everything further again!Sonic and Knuckles - Really Sonic 3: Episode 2, Sonic and Knuckles offers the same amount of awesomeness as Sonic 3 does. Knuckles in Sonics 2 & 3 and Blue Sphere are unlockable games!Sonic Spinball - I actually find this a mediocre title. It's not bad at all, but a pinball adventure with Sonic feels kinda off, and hard to progress through.Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine - A mashup of Puyo Puyo and the Adventures of Sonic cartoon show, the puzzle gameplay is incredibly addicting, and the opponents are just as goofy as in the show. Definitely a must-play if you're a puzzle fan.Sonic 3D Blast - Since the game is pretty long compared to other Genesis games due to its gimmick involving collecting Flickies, I'm so glad there's a save feature in this collection. Anyway, this pseudo-3D Sonic has a slightly slower pace due to said gimmick, but it's still a lot of fun.Flicky - Sonic 3D Blast's collecting Flickies gimmick comes from this arcade title. However, this game is at a much faster pace.Ristar - An overlooked gem with very colorful levels! Definitely worth a play!The Ooze - Um...This game actually never really appealed to me, so I can't help you here. Go and see what anyone else has to say about The Ooze!Comix Zone - One of the most creative games EVER (A comics creator gets sucked into his own comic book!), Comix Zone is a pretty rad beat 'em up with very robust scenery.==GAME GEAR GAMES== (Weird to see handheld games be played on a collection like this, but whatever)Sonic the Hedgehog - This 8-Bit counterpart to the high-speed classic has its gameplay a bit more simplified, but it's no less great fun!Sonic Chaos - This game is yet another classic Sonic platformer, except in 8-Bit form, of course. There's nothing I can really note about it standing out from the other Sonic games other than its levels, but it's fun to play nevertheless.Sonic Drift - Basically, this is Sega's take on Namco's arcade classic Pole Position. And it's just as good as that game.Sonic Labyrinth - This is the only really bad Sonic game on the list. It has a HUGE lack of speed, and the maze-like gameplay just isn't fun...Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine - It's questionable inclusion, really. Why would Sega put on a handheld version of a Genesis game, in the same collection, that plays identical? This is literally the Genesis game in 8-Bit format. Of course, the game itself would have the same fun factor...I guess.Sonic Blast - There's a bit of sloppy design here and there, but Sonic Blast plays a lot like Sonic Chaos, which is a good thing, making this another one to play. Don't be fooled by the title, as it's not an equivalent to Sonic 3D Blast.So, yeah. We've got a really meaty lineup here. Even if you think a few games sucked, there's still lots of greatness remaining! I've reviewed a good majority of these games, in fact, so if this one review isn't enough to convince you to get this collection, be sure to go find my reviews for almost every one of these above games!

Geez...you've seen what Sega has done in recent years. Although there were some bad Sonic games in the line of the 2000s' Sega games, the company has released a lot of game collections, and this is on of them. Actually, even more recently, these collections are HUGE. This one has 28 games, plus 5 unlockable ones, resulting in 33 total!Most (Like...over 90% of these games) of these Sega Genesis games are already released in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, but there's still a reason to own this even if you already have that compilation. That reason is: This is the PSP version, meaning that you are playing 33 games within the palm of your hand!The games themselves are awesome, for the most part. There are a few games that aren't really worth it, like Alex Kidd and maybe the sequels to Golden Axe (They don't really live up to the first game well), but lemme tell ya, there are platformers, fighting games, arcade games, puzzlers, and EVEN FREAKING RPGs (Phantasy Star games)!C'mon..you know you want to play all of these 33 games. It's an offer for your PSP you can't possibly refuse.

Mortal Kombat was no stranger to portable handheld conversions, but unfortunately, those versions of the Mortal Kombat games usually turn out to be pretty crappy. Every once and a while, there would be a good Mortal Kombat on the go. For example, we've got Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, and Deadly Alliance on Game Boy Advance. And now we have an arcade-perfect port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on the Nintendo DS.When I said arcade-perfect, I MEANT it. This DS version is almost exactly as it was in the arcades! The fighting gameplay is superb, and the graphics are brilliantly digitized and pretty awesome to look at. The sounds/music are great, too, complete with realistic punching/kicking/whatever sounds and a rad soundtrack. To make things even better, you can play this game with anyone in the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to test your skills to the max!But there was something that just didn't quite appeal to me. Is it just me, or is the game REALLY hard? Heck, I couldn't even beat the game on Novice Mode, considering Shao Kahn (the last fighter) would never give me a chance to beat up on him. I'm sure the game is actually possible to beat, but still....You'd expect the game to be pretty forgiving on lower difficulty modes. In this case, I just feel slight differences that helped me progress. Either that, or Shao Kahn is the same in every difficulty mode. At least the game isn't flat-out impossible like Mortal Kombat Advance.Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 certainly is a pretty great fighting game, but it sure does seem a bit small when comparing it to other DS titles on the shelf. So Midway made a great decision: Tack on Puzzle Kombat, the puzzler spin-off to Mortal Kombat!Puzzle Kombat is a pretty good puzzle game. Through the MK elements displayed onscreen (like the fighters), clearing blocks and creating combos help make the game feel like a Mortal Kombat game. Of course, this is more similar to Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, but hey! This game is cool and fun! And it helps add to the value of this DS cartridge. I just wish Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 wasn't so difficult on here...

Super Mario Bros 3 is often considered to be the greatest game on the NES and as the best Mario game of all time (Although I prefer Mario World).This GBA version includes more than what meets the eye. The differences between this and the original are:-Closer camera view (Something I forgot to mention in my Mario Advance 1 review) for the GBA-Small color differences (Not including lighter palliate)-Voices-Get to play as an updated Luigi-Level select after beating the game once. Just press B on the map-The updated version of Mario Bros carried over from the first Super Mario AdvanceThe best difference is the fact that you get to use the e-reader GBA add-on to be able to unlock/use all-new levels and power-ups. Heck, you can even use the cape from Super Mario World! The levels you can unlock are full of fan-appealing Mario goodness. You can throw veggies, like in SMB2, against enemies from Mario World! If you're lucky, you can find a card that lets you play the first level from the original Super Mario Bros! There's a lot more awesomeness coming your way. You just gotta buy cards.Like I said just now, this game also includes the GBA version of Mario Bros, where you actually get to run, throw Pow blocks, and play as the Mario from Super Mario 2.The multiplayer modes are also present. You can play with or against a friend, collecting 5 coins, or just sabotaging him/her.

We all love a good Mario Kart game every now and then right? Super Mario Kart was great, Mario Kart 64 was even better, Super Circuit brought back all the elements of SMK, and now, we approach Mario Kart: Double Dash. Does this game stack up to all the other games in the series? Well, OF COURSE!Mario Kart: Double Dash features a huge variety in courses and characters, like the other games in the series, but unlike them, Double Dash's main highlight, where you use 2 characters at once, takes the series to brand new heights! Not only was it fun to select which 2 characters race together (Baby Mario and Wario? Heh.), and to hold more than one item, but you can also play with a friend together in Co-op mode! And to top it all off, the racing is MUCH, MUCH FASTER than in all of the other games!As for the items, they were just as insane as the 2-driver concept. Sure, you still have the average Koopa shells, Banana Peels, etc, but you also get a flying Spiny shell that creates a quick explosion in the 1st Place player's spot (Previous games had it wingless), and Special Items exclusive to each character (Mario: Fireball - Toad: Golden Mushroom)!!The courses were more creative than ever. Here, we drive on a freaking cruiser ship, through prehistoric times, a couple stadiums, and even highways with multiple paths! And let's not forget the new feature in which we play through all 4 cups in one sitting!Lastly, it's hardly ever known, but with some hard work, you can actually connect with 16 other people and play online! With some effort, it can be done....and you'll have an extreme experience unlike any other.So overall, it's one of craziest, most fast-paced kart racers I've ever played! In fact, I think I may as well prefer this game over Mario Kart Wii! Sure, MKWii has easily accessible online play, but Double Dash nails everything else!

I miss old Cartoon Network. There are so many great cartoon shows that they had replaced with total crap that airs today (At least Ed Edd 'n Eddy still airs daily). Thank god for Boomerang (a channel hosted by Cartoon Network composed of old cartoons) and Cartoon Planet (Comes on CN every Friday) for bringing back these infinitely superior shows!Johnny Bravo is just plain RICH! The show, from the intro to the end of the episode, is filled with the absolute hilariousness not found on TV cartoons today (with very few exceptions)! And get this: Seth Macfarlane, who went on to make FAMILY GUY, helped make the show!The show is about a blonde man who is blinded by his own "manliness". He looks cool, but he never succeeds in scoring any girls. Sound too much like a sitcom? Don't worry. The show itself offers A LOT more than just that. Just wait til you see Johnny team up with ADAM WEST to track down what happened to his mother, or maybe watch as he tries to capture a clown on an airplane. Yep. This is one crazy and terrifically fun show. There's even a crossover with Scooby Doo (and yes, it's in this DVD, too)!If you don't want to buy the DVD just yet, and watch an episode first, go on Boomerang, or wait for Cartoon Planet to come and air one. You will NOT be disappointed!

The movie-based Cars on the Game Boy Advance was actually a pretty decent title. After all, Cars's theme involves racing, and that's material alone for a video game. Cars DS, on the other hand...............I have no idea what was going on behind this one.The game is actually...a poor man's minigame collection. The minigames you find on this thing are either dull or are knockoffs of old timey games. For example, the blinking traffic light minigame is just another Simon. The minigame with the car "Snot Rod" is a variation of bunches of LCD electronics, in which you just simply dodge cars. The minigame where you fill up gas for cars....That's just dumb and plays badly.Apparently, there just so happens to be racing....But believe it or not, THAT plays more like a minigame than freaking Mario Kart!! On top of that, the AI is dumb as rocks. Chick (the green car) always wiggles around and the other cars just stay still. Oh wait...I'm only against Chick? BULL. And guess what? You can even cheat in the race. Just keep using the brakes to build up speed (Because you'll automatically be moving forward anyway), and once the finish line comes, just zoom in to win.And with no reason to come back, Cars on the DS is just plain trash. If you have a choice, PLEASE go get the Game Boy Advance version. It's much more fun and actually has RACES.

When I reviewed the Ultimate Codes for Pokemon DS games, I said that you shouldn't have to buy another Action Replay, that has the same codes as these dumb things, for the same system. But isn't Wario World a short game? I'm pretty sure you don't need cheat codes....Besides, the cheat device even manages to help me bust ANOTHER gut by having to cost 2 or 3 times the price of a used copy of Wario World! Jeez.

Toy Story 2 differed completely from the console versions of the game, but it's still a pretty good game. Once you get the hang of the awkward control scheme (Press A while standing still to jump, A while walking to run), the game is actually pretty enjoyable.The storyline is very similar to the movie's, but for some reason, a deleted scene from the movie is used as a setting for the first level (Woody falls out the window).The gameplay is pretty good. There may be just about 10 levels, but the game is pretty fun to play.The music is alright. It sometimes sounds good, but one background song might sound dull. The sound effects are acceptable, too.The graphics are good for the Game Boy.Overall, it's another stellar movie game.

===SONIC 3===You totally adored the first two Sonics. Now what is that you will expect from this sequel? Well, most of the action remains the same, except that like any good sequel, it improves upon the original gameplay GREATLY. Now we have ELEMENTAL shields, that give you a special power to go with you being a bit more invulnerable. For example, the Bubble Shield allows you to breathe underwater and bounce, while the Fire Shield has no effect against fiery projectiles. The game also allows Tails to fly, so when you're playing as him, it can reaaally help when it comes to certain tight spots.The worlds in this game are more colorful and lively than ever, as well as including even more flashy speed and gimmicks. TO top it off, the levels are actually much longer than in the previous installments. No more are the levels a mere 30 seconds. Now they range from 2-6 minutes! Although I'd feel a bit desperate about finishing a level at times, it's still pretty cool to get to experience everything a bit more! Want to take a break? There's a save feature. In fact, there are LOTS of save files.Oh yes. Did I forget to mention that Michael Jackson helped out for the game's soundtrack?===Sonic and Knuckles===Literally Sonic 3: Part 2, Sonic and Knuckles is more of the same, except without Tails. Thankfully, the new zones are just as much fun to explore as that of Sonic 3's. Other than that, it's just like Sonic 3, as well as just as hugely fun.This Windows 95 release of the two games is a pretty good one. The music is composed of MIDIs, but they sound pretty amazing. Plus, you can play the combined "Sonic 3 & Knuckles", which allows you to play through both games as if they were one, without the need of the original S&K; cartridge's "Lock-on technology"

The original Castlevania was a blast, the sequel was a mediocre mess, the third was an epic return to form, but what does this fourth game in the series have to offer? Well, let's just say it combines the awesomism of both Castlevanias 1 & 3! And since the Super Nintendo is one heck of a gaming machine, you can guess how this turns out.The classic whipping platforming action remains unharmed in this installment. In fact, it is massively improved! Along with the signature items (Cross, tomahawk, dagger, etc), you can now whip in multiple directions! Heck, you can whip it in literally ANY direction possible! Up, down, diagonal, and you can even wiggle it!Naturally, one would think that it would make the overall experience a cakewalk then, right? WRONG! The geniuses at Konami still managed to keep the difficulty leaning over to the hard side. There are still all kinds of enemies, each with their own unique patterns. The level design is magnificent like always (You know...With the exception of the 2nd game), and keeps things rather interesting. There will even be an area or two utilizing the Super NES's Mode 7 (fake 3D) visuals for backgrounds, as well as Dracula's castle rotating as you try to avoid falling into spike pits!On top of all this, the graphics couldn't be any better, and the soundtrack is just plain fabulous. You really owe it to yourself to play this if you're a Castlevania fan.

Okay, try to imagine Contra, but instead of jumping around on platforms killing people, you fly around in space killing machines and spaceships! That describes S.C.A.T. in a nutshell.All of the levels auto-scroll, but there's enough flying objects and 8-Bit explosions onscreen to keep you entertained. The game manages to be as hard as Contra, however, if not harder. You start with 6 lives, but what you may think is a health bar is actually your amount of lives. So, 6 hits and then it's Game Over. Fortunately, there are infinite continues, so you have a lot of time to complete the levels.The power-up system is also Contra-ish, only the power-up blocks give different upgrades to your gun. The block with the letter R gives you about 3 lives, but it comes when you're close to beating the level.During gameplay, you will realize that there are two floating orbs around your character. What do they do? YOU SHOOT OUT OF THEM! In fact, you shoot out them like cannons the same time you use your gun. They move around you in a circle, but you can stop them from moving and keep them aimed in one spot.Overall, if you love Contra or shooters in general, this is a must-have.

As much as I love cartoons from the 1930s and a bit beyond (Tom and Jerry, Popeye, Mickey Mouse, Looney Tunes), I have to say that when it comes to Animaniacs, there's no need for those other shows, or even shows during its own time. It may seem like a show aimed at kids, but I can easily say it's enjoyable and a lot of fun for ages above.Way back when (late 90s, I suppose), little SMB Madman once watched the Animaniacs movie, Wakko's Wish, on Cartoon Network. I don't remember how much I liked it back then, but when I recently (Few months ago) revisited it and watched it again, I asked myself: Why wasn't I a fan of this earlier? Then, I went on from there to watch episodes of the show.Animaniacs is a show that is not to be missed. It has the best sense of humor I've seen from any cartoon series. There are teens/adults that wonder if they wouldn't find the show funny to them, but then they said "JEEZ this show beats a great deal of crap spewed out on TV today!"Plus, today's cartoons (Cartoon Network shows, in particular) have jokes that always seem to either be stale or fart jokes. Animaniacs has none of that stuff. No matter how many times I see even a same episode, I'd always end up laughing. (Just so you know, they even sneak in an adult-aimed joke or 2 on certain occasions - Kids are always likely not to notice)There are also original songs sung in the show. Unlike every other show, in which I just feel they are unnecessary, I actually like how thought-out they are and how well they sound (I'd even wish I was born earlier once I hear Yakko sing in the episode "A Christmas Plotz" - His song is classic). Any educational song is also welcome, and it could even help a kid learn something valuable.The show isn't just aimed at the Warner Bros, though. It's also about a little girl and her dog, who always ends up in hilarious situations, two squirrels (One young - Skippy, one old - Slappy), 3 pigeons, and even more characters come into the scene! Fortunately, they too have skits that are as equally funny and within quality as each other and the Warners.It's disappointing to see that the show is not on TV anymore, and just when I was really heading back to it...Today, the Warner Bros company is making episodes for a new Looney Tunes show, but that show is more like a cartoon sitcom that bears little to no resemblance of the original, with the exception of CGI Road Runner shorts. I wish more cartoon shows were as great as Animaniacs is.

Every Sonic fan knows the old-school Sonic lineup: Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuck- Wait! Are you saying I'm missing one? Oh yes I am! Sonic 1, Sonic 2, SONIC CD, Sonic 3, etc!Sonic CD was released for the notorious Sega CD, an add-on for the Genesis. It was the only game on the add-on to sell around a million copies.Sonic CD took what made Sonics 1 & 2 so awesome, and multiplied them by 10! This game has all the high-speed Sonic action you could ever want. The new zones were better than ever. In the Special Stages, you navigate Sonic around roads to destroy UFOs to gather Chaos Emeralds; a unique goal for a Special Stage.The music and sounds are extremely amazing thanks to the compact disc.The graphics are really great. There are even animated cutscenes!Overall, this is one Sonic game you have gotta try! It's the best Sonic game ever!

(Note: This is a review of the show in general, not the DVD disc itself)Ah, yes....The Looney Tunes. It's a series of classic cartoons in which the characters would usually match wits to outsmart each other. The result is one of the best cartoon shows of all time. THIS, on the other hand.........Eeehhhhhhhhh...........It seems like the economy's affected the wonderful world of Looney Tunes, as the clever characters are now rather dumbed down to regular people in animal suits.The Looney Tunes Show is not what I'd call a revival. The characters that you knew and love now live in generic houses in a generic neighborhood with generic people. There's still a nice amount of those classic characters, but they lost their fun personalities from the old cartoons.Bugs Bunny, who was extremely witty, clever, and ended up in devious situations, is now only regularly smart and cautious, while also trying to avoid trouble. Daffy has been watered (No pun intended) down to the average dumb guy in a cartoon show. Speedy Gonzales is no longer known for his speed (?!), but is more known for his pizza. Yosemite Sam struggles in life, and Elmer Fudd is a newscaster...There's a LOT more sadistic changes to these formerly lovable characters, but I may as well stop here.What's even worse is that they sometimes hang around and talk to the generic people. It's very weird watching them interact with plain human beings. They don't fit well with the humans at all. Sure, Animaniacs had some humans appear in the show, but even they happen to have unique personalities. Here, they seem like filler characters. In fact, there was an episode where Bugs and Daffy tried to get a HUMAN GIRL to be his girlfriend and win her over. What is Warner Bros thinking?Fortunately, there are characters that stick to their roots. Sylvester and Tweety, for example, still chase each other around. The most notable still-mainstay is the shorts in which Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner do what they always do: Outwit each other as the Coyote tries to capture his prey. Although updated to CGI animation, they are just as fun to watch as the older Road Runner cartoons.The last thing I'll talk about are the musical scenes. In Merrie Melodies, a certain character sings. Lemme just say: It is exactly how it sounds...The whole show isn't bad, though. After all, the jokes that the characters make are still very funny (Although most of the humor is through dialogue, not slapstick), and there are still some good moments, such as Foghorn Leghorn and Daffy's trying to make a movie. But while the show is good as a cartoon sitcom, it can't even hold a candle compared to what the old Looney Tunes show brought us.

(NOTE: SINCE JULY 2012, THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN ENTIRELY REWRITTEN)Well, since New Super Mario Bros 2 is coming out for the 3DS later, I kinda figured I may as well go back and look at the title that started a series that harks back to the even-older days. I remember when I used to be really excited for this one. After seeing a picture of a supersized Mario running through a field of Koopas, I had to get it. However, it kept being delayed....And then when it finally came out, I got it, and I wasn't disappointed.Those that have played the original Super Mario Bros series (as well as Super Mario World) know what to expect. Classic 2D Goomba-stomping block-breaking action throughout all-new levels. This is something we haven't seen since Super Mario World (Although there have been remakes and stuff), so it is pretty cool getting fresh 2D Super Mario action once again. What's also great is that the gameplay still remains to be good fun, and with all these new levels, as well as some other elements mixed in, it just makes it even better.One downside is that while the minigames were a nice touch, but they were mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS. I guess it's okay for those that don't own Mario 64 DS, but those expecting new minigames will be disappointed.However, 4-Player multiplayer makes the minigames fresh again! Meanwhile, you can also play with a friend in a Versus mode in while Mario and Luigi compete and find Stars around 5 levels. That is pretty fun, actually, especially when getting to use the power-ups to sabotage the other player.Overall, this is a pretty great adventure that does the original SMB series justice. Let's just hope New Super Mario Bros 2 does something clever with its coin gimmick...

You know something? Whenever I watch the Penguins of Madagascar on Nickelodeon, there's this weird feeling I happen to have. It's not that the show was bad. Heck, it's better than what's on Cartoon Network today, but it's just strange to see a Madagascar series run for so long without the movie series' cast: Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo, and Melman the giraffe. Fortunately, this is a return to form.Like anything you expect from Dreamworks, the comedy is as funny as the average movie they make, and the characters are memorable. Plus, the storyline is ridiculous. King Julian (lemur) fears a mysterious being that is attacking them with candy canes. Of course, it was Santa Claus. But he doesn't remember anything, since Alex threw a ground stake at him, not knowing who he was. Because of this, the cast we know and love has to deliver the presents.Their journey is just plain crazy, with silly situations, such as wondering how to get into the house unsuspected. Meanwhile, King Julian tries to show Santa how he celebrates Christmas (aka calls it Julianuary and has people bring him gifts). It's really fun watching what the characters do and what they say, as in any well-made CGI comedy. Although not a full movie, Merry Madagascar fits right in with the original series.

Weird, isn't it? Sonic Adventure was just out when this game was released, and it doesn't involve any modern Sonic action whatsoever. It's like a Genesis-era Sonic game, except released at a more recent time. There's nothing wrong with that, though. Sonic Pocket Adventure is certainly one of the best 8-Bit offerings the Blue Blur has ever starred in.Pocket Adventure borrows the level environments from Sonic 2 (Special stage, too), but adds different names (Cosmic Casino?), as well as new level designs to make it fresh again. The soundtrack is borrowed from the likes of Sonics 2, 3, & Knuckles, with a few original tunes into the mix. The bosses are definitely new (With the exception of a surprise appearance by Knuckles), and they are somewhat challenging.While the game does scream "rehash", it's not a remake of a Genesis Sonic game, and it fares much better than the more recent Sonic 4 ever does, mostly due to the fact that the classic high-speed platforming (Complete with the Spin Dash move) is extremely top-notch and fun, with the physics being spot-on. Like I said, the new level designs and bosses show that the game isn't a remake, but rather its own game. If you're looking for a good Sonic game to play, you should really get yourself a Pocket Color and buy this game. It's familiar, but not copied. You can think of it as a rehash, but in my perspective, it's an all-new fun and great classic Sonic game.

I don't understand Mario sports games. The Mario Golf and Tennis series always have their console games filled up with game modes, but for the handheld games, there are some game modes and AN RPG. That's the case with Mario Tennis: Power Tour (Or should I say, Mario Power Tennis GBA?).While not exactly like Mario Power Tennis on the Gamecube, the voice clips and special moves are taken from that game. Plus, the graphics are pre-rendered.Anyways, you get these game modes: An Exhibition mode, some minigames (unlock these in the RPG), and the Adventure mode, which is the RPG. You know the drill in tennis: Serve, whack the ball, and get the other guy out. The game is a very well-done adaptation of the sport. Playing it as a video game actually makes it kind of addicting to play.The awkward part about this game, though, is the character selection. Sure, you get Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Donkey Kong. But there's no Wario, yet there's Waluigi. What the heck? Who came up with that idea?The RPG portion takes up a lot of the game. Instead of battling people by taking turns using attacks, you play tennis. But it gets a little deeper as it turns out you must level up your character. You also have to beat everybody at tennis in the Junior Courts to get to the Senior Courts, and so on.Let's not forget the minigames. You unlock these in the Workout building in the RPG mode. They play like arcade games, except they were built out of tennis. You have hitting against the wall, hitting the ball to specific parts of the other side of the court, and, my favorite, the one where you jump over barrels and banana peels on a giant treadmill. They are all very fun to play.So overall, Mario Tennis: Power Tour is worth it mostly for the RPG. The game can go pretty deep when it comes to using tennis as a basis for this kind of genre.

Tetris is one of the best puzzle games in existence, and everyone (should) knows that! The addictiveness of the game is so intense that it will hook pretty much anybody, perhaps even those that haven't been interested in puzzle games before. But there are so many versions of Tetris, and on every single system, too. Which one should you get? Tetris DS is the answer.Good GOD there's so much to do in Tetris DS! Let's cut to the chase on what the game has to offer:First, we have the Standard mode. Even this thing comes with multiple variations, including a Marathon. What is totally awesome about Marathon mode is that while you're playing Tetris, there's gameplay footage of an old NES game atop. If it's Super Mario Bros, or SMB3, the said games' camera scrolls whenever you clear lines! Awesome!!!Then, there's a Touch mode, making use of the DS stylus. There are bunches of blocks piled as a tower. What you gotta do is rotate and move the blocks to clear lines. The result is a great new spin on an old formula.The game's Zelda-themed Mission mode gives players specific things to do as they play. For example, you may have to clear lines with a certain block, or maybe you have to clear lines at a certain height. Does it harm the formula? Nope. Once again, it's enhanced!A Catch mode in a Tetris game? Well, it actually turned out to be just fine! You guide a block, and you must catch other falling blocks. In order for you to shrink in size, you must form a cube out of the stray blocks and yourself. How the heck do they pull this stuff of so flawlessly?There's also a Push mode. It's a battle against the CPU, and you must clear lines to push the CPU to its doom!Think it's all covered yet? Nope. We still have one more game mode here, and it is perhaps the most faithful to another puzzle game that the mode's theme is based off of: Yoshi's Cookie. Already a great puzzler, have it fused with Tetris, and it results to you manually having to choose which blocks you can use to clear all of the lines. It is all based on logic, so you have to plan it all carefully.All of these game modes are extremely fun, and they are all as majorly awesome as the original Tetris game. But considering there's a lot of playtime to go with each of these game modes, this game will stay in your DS for a loooong time.FURTHERMORE, there's an ONLINE MODE! Yeah! You can actually play against other people across the globe! Whether it's facing against a lone other player normally, or facing against 3 others by using items Mario Kart-style, this alone would be the reason why to buy this DS cartridge! This is definitely the best DS puzzler, as well as perhaps one of the best puzzle games PERIOD. It's NES theme only makes it all the more better.

If you like puzzle games similar to Tetris, then Dr. Mario is right up your alley.Dr. Mario contains 20 levels of virus-bustin' difficulty.The game is a simple 4-in-a-row type of puzzler. Back then, it was pretty unique and was thought of being obviously inspired by Tetris.It's a really addicting puzzle game, but things are even more fun on the Game Boy because of its portability.However, the Game Boy Advance port of the NES title is more expensive than the original versions (Counting Game Boy)Since there's already a Game Boy version, which is about 6 bucks less than this port, you should go get that instead.

It is a strange concept. A fat white person raised by fellow Japanese people as a ninja has to go to Beverly Hills for a mission given to him by an attractive woman. But it all works, thanks to the seemingly INFINITE amount of comedy bits and running gags in Beverly Hills Ninja!If you already aren't amused by the movie's concept, just wait til you see what kinds of situations Chris Farley (playing the role of "Haru") gets into! Watch as he... Disguises himself as a pimp, teaches Chris Rock how to be a ninja, fails at being stealthy, barges into a strip club, etc. Crazy, ain't it?As for running gags, there are plenty! For one, Haru's "brother" follows him along in case of any trouble, with Haru himself not being aware of his presence. So, whenever getting into brutal fights, he fights along with Haru. And he even hides in literally EVERYWHERE Haru goes! Another hilarious gag is, of course, Chris Rock. He's supposed to be a hotel clerk, but after Haru teaches him about the ways of ninja, every now and then, he'd be seen chasing a chicken! And let's not forget the gag in which Haru always says "Thanks, @$$hole!" instead of a regular "thank you"! The most occurring gag, obviously, of course, is the slapstick comedy throughout. This happens a LOT. Nearly every single time! And each time is HILARIOUS!If you love Adam Sandlers's films (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, etc), Chris Farley's starring role here fits right in with those comedies! It's a shame Farley died at a young age......

Excitebike is a classic motorcycle racing game for the NES. It features 5 tracks and 3 great game modes (However, no 2-Player). One mode lets you design a track. It's pure racing action now available for your e-reader.Just scan those 5 cards and play that awesomeness you've been waiting for.It's gonna be well worth that $5 bucks.

The Game Boy Advance has lots of interesting titles out there, but if you are hungry for more, and in a certain fashionable way, get the e-reader.The e-reader is a peripheral where you scan a certain number of cards to play a game those cards represent. It's a very unique concept for a peripheral.Most of the games are ported NES games, while some are original titles, such as Mario Party e.Some Pokemon cards have compatibility with the e-reader. When they work, a detailed Pokedex-style description pops up. If you can find cards with dotted lines on the sides, a certain minigame is unlockable.Overall, you should get this if you are either a NES fan, a GBA fan, or you just like to scan cards to play games.Sadly, this concept was never carried on.

You know...it's strange. This game has actually been re-released onto Virtual Console as Secret Commando to avoid copyright issues. Sometimes, I just don't know how that works. However, I can see why it was re-released: It is so addicting that I bet the development team didn't want anybody to miss out on this classic.The premise of the game is pretty simple. All you gotta do is move and shoot the enemies as they try to kill you. There is also a Two-Player mode in which you both go and shoot off the bad guys in your paths. It looks and plays like it was a greatly well-made shooter.BUT, there's one problem I have with this game: The difficulty. It just gets hard at times when you try to think of certain strategies involving killing the enemies, because it's possible they'll kill you before you start it, and I don't mean by mistiming, either.But overall, this is one good shooter you should try out. It isn't bad, so let it pass.

Pac-Man needs no introduction. It's a timeless classic that will be played for generations TO COME. How? Well, it's been and always will be released on every system known to man. So what does that make Pac-Man on the Neo Geo Pocket Color? After all, the NGPC itself was released after Pac-Man was already released on Game Boy. Twice. Plus, The Game Boy Advance would eventually be released, and knowing Pac-Man's widespread release, surely a version would come out on that handheld.Well, those that stuck with the Neo Geo were in for a good time with Pac-Man. This version is nearly arcade-perfect. The graphics and gameplay were the exact same as the arcade original! That said, dot-munching and ghost-avoiding felt as fluid as ever. This game is great.However, Pac-Man by itself does not make the price all that worthy. Like I said, Pac-Man's been released on every previous thing already. But what I didn't mention was that it was packed with some titles. Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures on the SNES and Sega Genesis included it, and the Game Boy's 2nd Pac-Man release had spin-off puzzler Pac-Attack bundled with it. The Game Boy Advance eventually had a whole compilation with Pac-Man being one of the titles.Like another review said: Why the game wasn't bundled with anything here on Neo Geo Pocket Color is beyond him/me.

In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. And years went by, it was ported to the 8-Bit Game Boy Color. Did it make the transition well? Well, the Donkey Kong Land games were great, so maybe this one would be good.DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements. Here, on the Game Boy Color, the graphics are still very colorful and greatly detailed.The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even find and play as an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun.Unlike the original Super Nintendo version, this game can save anytime. So where does that lead Candy's Save Point to? It just so turns out that it became a bonus game area. Thank god you can now autosave. I kinda don't like having to struggle through a level just to get to the save point. Either I have to reach there or lose all of my lives. Now that that's out of the way, I can save the trouble for hard levels easily.Overall, this is a really great Game Boy Color game. It's WELL worth the money.

Let's say you go buy a Nintendo 64 one day. You purchase it, with all of its required hookups and controllers. You go home, you play Super Mario 64, but GUESS WHAT IS MISSING? Oh yeah! The Controller Pak!The Controller Pak is what you seriously need to put in the back of your controller so you can save your files for the games you play.If you can't find one of these for your Nintendo 64, you are immediately helpless.You would be a total idiot to leave this out of your controller. You need this thing to save your game!

Sonic has come a loooong way since his debut on the Sega Genesis. But during that long road, in the mid-2000s, he managed to hit a bunch of speed bumps. Then he was brought back to form with Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations. But how about we go to waaay before those titles? The game that was right before all of those speed bumps?Sonic Heroes features an interesting premise - Being able to control a group of 3 Sonic characters at the same time makes the cool action much more robust. You get a selection of 4 teams: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles -- Medium difficulty), Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, Omega -- Harder difficulty), Team Rose (Amy, Cream, and.....Big -- Easy), and Team Chaotix (Vector, Charmy, Espio -- A unique take on the gameplay, as it offers missions rather than the usual reach-the-end goal).Each team would have formations that fit each of the 3 characters. There's speed, flying, and power. Whenever there's a certain obstacle in the way, the game would tell which formation to use (Meaning you must switch to the character of that formation). I guess it's nice for them to just tell us. After all, it provides a more straightfoward take on the 3D Sonics, not really slowing us down when it comes to having to know what to do (Except for Team Rose when playing their tutorial level...).Speaking of straightfoward, like I said, the game is all about reaching the end of each level, and when beating that level, you go to the next right away. No map, no talking to people, but just simple and to the point. While there are 3D masterpieces that go by that stuff (Mario 64, anyone? With the castle lobby? And certain Toads you talk to give you Stars?), Sonic Heroes proves that there are some cases where they're not needed. The gameplay itself is as perfect as any Genesis or Sonic Adventure-style Sonic game, except, of course, you've got 3 characters to toy with. Oh, yes, and the level design is top-notch.I never actually realized how aged the game feels compared to the more recent Sonic games. The voices are old, the cutscenes also show their age, and the storyline feels weak. Actually, it's quite interesting to see where Sega was going early on in Sonic's lifetime, so I guess it would be fun to notice the differences yourself. The story is still weak, though.Other than the story, the only bad thing about this game is the voice acting. It reeeallly sucks (Although Big's voice = Comedy gold. I keep laughing whenever he says something). Tails sounds like a girl (Of course, this would go on until Sonic Colors), One of Amy's screams is ear-bleeding (I turned down the volume during Team Sonic's battle with Team Rose), and there are sayings that keep being repeated. But personally, I think this is somewhat of a minor issue, as everything else is terrific. If you can get past the voice acting like I did, then you're in for a good time.

Okay, I get it. Pac-Man's on his 30th (31st, counting 2011?) Anniversary, but the point is: Pac 'n Roll is a very good game. Unlike Pac-Pix for the Nintendo DS, where it was an innovative arcade-style game, Pac 'n Roll is not really innovative, but it's a whole platform-adventure.Think of this game as a more straightfoward Pac-Man World installment, but with the lack of being able to actually jump. Fortunately, as you roll Pac-Man with the stylus, you may find some cool power-ups as you advance through the levels. One gives Pac-Man some armor to make him heavy. Another gives Pac-Man wings, so he can soar through the air while he's rolling.The level design is pretty interesting, as there are many different obstacles, such as bouncing platforms, ramps, breakable objects, and good ol' ghost-chomping action. The challenge is spot-on, too. Sometimes, it maaaay be a bit too hard, but in the end, it's another fun Pac-Man game. Plus, the original arcade Pac-Man is an unlockable game.So overall, this is a great game. Definitely pick it up if you're a Pac-Fan.

Sonic R has appeared on the failed Sega Saturn and the PC.You get to choose from a selection of characters, each with their own abilities. Sonic can double jump, Tails can fly (For a limited time), Amy drives a car that can turn into a boat, Knuckles can glide, Eggman can shoot missles, etc. However, that's one of the complaints about the game. Tails's tails make a really annoying spinning sound, Amy's car is too slow, and Eggman needs to pay 10 rings per missle he shoots.(SPOILER ALERT RIGHT HERE)The unlockable characters are Eggman, Metal Sonic, Metal Knuckles, Tails Doll, EggRobo, and Super Sonic. Metal Sonic and Knuckles can glide on water, EggRobo is a robot equivalent to Eggman, and Tails Doll......just floats. He has no special powers other than floating....(SPOILER ENDS HERE)There are only 5 courses. Wait...just 5? Compared to Mario Kart's 20? Wow. Each course has their own gimmicks, of course.There aren't really any flaws with the racing, but the CPUs can be cheap at times. There are Chaos Emeralds and tokens hidden in the courses. You have to be in first in order to keep the emeralds, but the tokens have a different story. When it comes to looking for the 5 tokens in each course, it's like playing a 3D scavenger hunt without any enemies. It doesn't matter what place you have to be in when you have all 5. Getting all 5 in a course lets you unlock a character...after beating him to another race.What is confusing is that once you start up your game after beating it, you'd think everything would still be there, right? Well, it doesn't turn out to be that way. You have to save/load your games every time.There's also a multiplayer VS mode, along with Time Trials and a new Tag Mode, which is self-explanatory: You play tag with the CPUs or your friends.The music is kinda weird. In the courses and title screen, women sing the songs.The character models look kinda weird. Why are Sonic's arms so thin?Overall, it's not a bad racing game, but it needs improvement.

Maze Madness was released not that long after Pac-Man World showcased a big platforming adventure starring everyone's favorite dot-muncher. Unlike Pac-Man World, though, Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness was actually more like the original arcade game, but heavily modified to feature obstacles, items, enemies, and a lot more! Oh, and there are areas where you do eat dots and avoid ghosts.The graphics are pretty rad, the music is awesome, and the gameplay is Ms. Pac-Man modernized for the better.The levels have unique designs, and they can actually be pretty challenging. Not in a way that is difficult (Although chances are there could be difficult parts), but there's actually kind of a puzzle-solving feel blended in with everything else. Sometimes, you gotta use your brain to progress forward. I think Namco did a good job with that.Even without the puzzle-solving, there's all kinds of stuff to toy around with. You've got springs, power pellets and dots, TNT boxes, moving platforms, ice, etc, ETC.As if Maze Madness wasn't big enough of a treat at this point, Namco also threw in the original Ms. Pac-Man arcade game. Nostalgic fans are welcome to step in and play...Ms. Pac-Man. Like the good ol' days.Overall, Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness is an awesome new take on the Pac-Man formula. Pick this one up if you're a Pac-Man fan.

Pac-Man World on Playstation proved that in a world where people would rather prefer games with guns, explosions, etc, there would still be a gem that wouldn't need any of that stuff. That stayed the same for the sequel, which was released on the Gamecube, the Playstation 2, the PC, and the Xbox. In 2004, Namco decided to re-release Pac-Man World for the Game Boy Advance. It had only 12 levels from the Playstation original, but it was still a great game to play. Now that PMW2 is released (in 2005, the year after), can I say the same?This version of the modern classic plays just like the first game, only except that there are fruit crates rather than fruit doors. There are also a lot more switches to press.There are 15 levels in this game. Since the levels in the console game are big and are in 3D, this game has all-new levels of the same names as the originals.Pac-Man can Rev-Roll, which is basically a Pac-Man version of Sonic's Spin Dash, Butt Bounce, and flip kick in the air, a move he couldn't do in the first PMW game.The music is amazingly the same as in the console versions, and in great quality, too. Although the Pac-Village music is missing (It got replaced by an underwater level's theme), The music still matches every level you play through.The graphics are also very detailed. As the first game was ported on GBA, though, it had 3D-rendered graphics. The graphics here are all 2D to begin with, but that makes the game look cartoonish in a nice way.One major flaw that I have with the game is the frustration that I have with the volcano levels and beyond those. In those levels, if you Rev Roll too low in some cases, chances are that you'd fall in the lava and lose a life. Even worse is when a fireball jumps up in the air unexpectedly! There are also ramps that dump you into deaths. You gotta know to Butt Bounce on the ramps to survive. These parts are just really annoying and frustrating.At least there is a Password feature. Yeah, I know. In the first game on GBA, there are 3 save files, but here, it's downgraded to a Password feature....Thankfully, you can skip those hard levels, I guess.Overall, it's a good game, but be sure to expect a tough challenge later in the volcano+ stages.

I remember one day, I happen to find this hanging around in a GameStop. I bought it because, hey, it's Pac-Man (I don't think I bought it at THESE prices, though). But as you play it, it's not only Pac-Man. It's Pac-Man reprogrammed faithfully onto an LCD screen on a handheld miniature arcade machine.The model design is another reason why I bought this. As I've already mentioned twice, it's a mini arcade machine. You can find Pac-Man machines in a lot of arcades. However, how would you like to have your own portable one? And not only that, but how about for the cost of about $40? Okay, maybe that is asking for a little much, considering it's a standalone version of Pac-Man, but it mimics the life-size machines, complete with joystick and a couple buttons for options.The game itself is pure Pac-Man. Even though it's replicated onto an LCD screen, nothing has changed. You must eat all the dots, while being chased by ghosts, but you can get Power Pellets to eat up the ghosts. Is that a bad thing? OF COURSE NOT! It's Pac-Man! How can you go wrong with that yellow muncher??? The game is fun and addicting, even in today's standards.

Family Matters is one of the best sitcoms I've ever seen. Okay, maybe that's a little too far, since I've seen very few other sitcoms, but Family Matters is just that great. You see, when watching this show, there isn't really a need to go watch any other sitcom because you've got all the amazing and clever humor right here.The characters in the show have personalities that are well structured, but the real star of the show happens to be Steve Urkel (played by Jaleel White), who is the nerd on the cover. His lovable dorkiness really adds to the show. When I watched the episodes of Family Matters that didn't have Steve (you know, the earlier ones), I thought they were funny. But when Steve came, this show's appeal suddenly grew to massive heights.Whatever you do, do NOT miss out on this hilarious sitcom! It's so awesome, it still airs on Nickelodeon!

This version of Namco Museum includes all of the arcade games that were in the Nintendo 64 version, with the exception of the original Pac-Man.The games included are Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Pole Position, and Dig Dug. All of these games contain simple gameplay, but it is very addicting.Overall, it's a neat collection, but you might overlook it for something like Super Mario Advance due to the fact that the arcade games are the only things on the cartridge.

Wario's Woods is, shock, a starring role for Mario character Toad (Wario's the villain). The game is an actually very interesting line-up-3-in-a-row kind of puzzle game in which Toad is playable in the play field, along with all of these colored creatures lying around. Although you must stack 2 creatures alongside each other, you must have the row contain a bomb either in between or at an end. You can line them up horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally. The result is an extremely addicting game that's as fun as Tetris.Things get more challenging when Wario comes into the scene, in place of pink harmless dinosaur Birdo. He spawns a few more creatures that you must destroy AND he makes the ceiling tumble slightly downwards! But don't worry. It doesn't last too long. Birdo would soon come back and resume watching without any gimmick up her (his?) sleeve.2-Player surely has people go to their competitive senses. If you like battling against your friend in puzzle games, this won't disappoint.So overall, this is a really big puzzler. It's recommended especially for puzzle fans.

The Playstation has a lot of interesting games going for it. So what does Sony do to promote the stuff? The company makes a collection of demos for some games. That's not a bad idea, considering that I don't recall another company doing such thing.This collection consists of 9 demos, 4 of which are demos of sports games. There are also demos of Spider-Man, Crash Bash, Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Army Men, and 102 Dalmations.The demos provide plenty of different gameplay types. From swinging and beating up bad guys to platforming in 3D to pulling off tricks and stunts.A few demos can be pretty cheap. For example, in Spider-Man, if you fall off a building, the demo instantly ends, and in Crash Bash, it's likely that you wouldn't always reach the 3rd minigame in Adventure Mode (There are time limits).Still, unless you own the full versions of some of these games, it's worth a look. It's also worth noting that it never costs a lot. Some copies can be $5. Some may be less. Heck, there are existing copies worth one buck!

A little history lesson before I talk about the game: In 2002, the whole company of Rare was purchased by Microsoft. Honestly, I thought that was a brutal advantage for Microsoft. Not only were there lots of Gamecube games canceled, but while Rare's entries on the Xbox had mixed reactions, they eventually turned into a mere Kinect developer you see them as today.Fortunately, in 2003/2004, before Rare's slow pain, THQ made a deal with Microsoft in which Rare could make some games for Game Boy Advance (Had this be done now, a Banjo game for 3DS would be everyone's dream). Since Microsoft doesn't have a handheld console, they agreed, resulting in a third Banjo game, Banjo Pilot, It's Mr. Pants, and probably more.===GAME REVIEW===Since this game came out before BK: Nuts and Bolts (Which is nothing like how a Banjo game should be), this is the real Banjo-Threeie, I guess. After all, it plays very satisfyingly and stays within the BK tradition of collecting notes and Jiggies (puzzle pieces) in a Mario 64-like fashion.The game plays like a combination of Zelda and, of course, Super Mario 64. You roam around in semi-3D environments, battling enemies, exploring areas, etc. It's more fun than described, really. You can use collected notes to learn new attacks you could use, and once you free Kazooie (Yeah, she's kidnapped for a portion of the game), you can actually use that bird as a gun firing eggs (Which you find in various areas as well)! Not to mention being able to use her to glide to areas you may not be able to normally reach.The graphics are amazing. Rare has done a great job to capture that Banjo-Kazooie feel. The environments truly appeal to the eye, with grassland worlds looking full of plant life, and other worlds looking quite unique as well. It might sometimes be difficult to judge distance on how you would land to the ground after jumping, but you'll get used to it quickly.Banjo Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge is a great adventure and whether you own a Game Boy Advance, a Nintendo DS (Lite), or a mobile phone, you should definitely get this.

Okay....Sonic the Hedgehog is a terrific game. But only on anything but the Game Boy Advance. See my review for the original Genesis version if you are curious about the REAL thing. This port....is awful. Utterly awful..How did Sega mess this up? They could have just simply ported the Genesis game onto the GBA, and call it a day. But nope. They had to "update" it to the horribleness that is at Sonic 2006 standards. Speaking of which, this port was created to UNDO the damage Sonic 2006 had caused worldwide. But obviously, that failed.So why is this game so bad on the Game Boy Advance? Well, first off, the camera is a bit more zoomed in than in the original. That way, you'll never know if an enemy or some other projectile would fly at you from above. The control is actually WORSE than the original! There would actually be a bit of lag! It doesn't take long to get Sonic to run, but you don't get that speedy feel. And when you jump, you actually move a bit clunkier!And then there are glitches. Come on? Really? Why did Sonic slip backwards into a space where he'd be crushed? Why did I go through Robotnik's wrecking ball? But those are only a few of some pretty fatal glitches you'd find whenever you play.The music for Sonic the Hedgehog is some of the best tunes you'd ever hear from the Sega Genesis. The Game Boy Advance is CLEARLY capable of it. Actually, it's capable of anything from the 8-Bit consoles to Super NES and Genesis. But the music happens to be poorly done on this port. It's like as if a sound chip from the NES was borrowed, with a measly 2 notes from the Genesis sound chip...By the way, the sound effects were wonky, too.The so-called Anniversary Mode sucks. It's only the inclusion of the Spin-Dash move from Sonic 2.The only good thing about this trashy port is that you can save. Games like Sonic could possibly be unforgiving without any save feature. Only experienced gamers could beat it under one sitting. Now, anyone could step into the action (Somewhat...) and still continue progressing.Overall, it's easy to see that this game would've be seen as the end of the Sonic franchise, along with Sonic 2006. Actually, even if Sega just directly ported the original Sega Genesis game without any changes, it would still be something to overlook, considering the fact that that version has been released on so many game collections (Sonic Jam, Mega Collection, Ultimate Genesis Collection, Sega Genesis Collection, to name A FEW).

Toy Story Racer for the Game Boy Color, at first glance, would immediately sound like a Mario Kart ripoff, but that's not the case here.The game is an on-rails racer, meaning you must turn when the track is curved, like in Pole Position. You can choose from four Toy Story characters, which is kind of a letdown since the Playstation version has more.The Tournament mode has about 6 (Or 7) tracks, and once you beat the mode, you unlock those courses for Quick Race mode. The tracks are actually pretty long, so if you don't have enough time to race another track in the Tournament, you can always write down the 6-digit password it gives out.The actual tracks, while they don't have a whole lot of items, are extremely impressive. Every single track is in fake 3D on an 8-Bit system....and yet it runs smoothly. It's kind of the reason why you'd continue playing this game. The items are snails, which slow you down, stars, which you just collect, horseshoes, which make you invincible, and tires, which make you steer in a mirrored way.Overall, it's another great movie-based title that is worth trying out.

Rayman 10th Anniversary is really just a bundle of Rayman Advance (A port of Rayman 1) and the GBA version of Rayman 3. However, these two games are very well-polished games. In fact, they can possibly be better than a lot of other games in your GBA library.===RAYMAN ADVANCE REVIEW===Rayman is awesome. The PC/PS1/Atari/Saturn classic now returns onto a handheld system....again. But this time, everything is how you would remember it in the original (Well, almost everything). Sure, the limitations of the Game Boy Advance brought down a bit of the quality in the game's music, but the tunes are still cool to listen to.Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP&lt; being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was this only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Game Boy Advance lying around.===RAYMAN 3 REVIEW===Rayman is a great platforming series. In fact, Rayman 2 remains to be one of the greatest 3D platformers of all time. The original Rayman is also heavily recommended by critics alike. On handhelds, the Rayman series had followed the original's 2D platforming, as well as expanding upon it.So how does Rayman 3 stack up? Well, it captured the first game's 2D gameplay the best out of the 3 handheld games, considering that the other two games were released for the Game Boy Color (Not counting Rayman Advance). Instead of being a 3D adventure like its console siblings, Rayman 3 breathes new life on the Game Boy Advance by using its 2D platforming gameplay at its finest.The game also borrows things from the console versions of Rayman 2. You can place spheres onto the triangles to open doors, ride Shells (walking missiles), and even fight the first boss the same way as you do in Rayman 2! Heck, even the familiar battle music plays when you fight an enemy! It's almost as if this game was closer to Rayman 2 than the Game Boy Color game. You know....to come to think of it, it was rumored that this was originally going to be a version of Rayman 2 for the Game Boy Advance. That could have been possible, but it's unknown why that was scrapped.You can't help but to bring up a smile as you play through Rayman 3's gorgeously detailed levels. They are all filled with fun and gimmicks. So overall, this is a must-have for your Game Boy Advance. If you want to play a 2D Rayman game for a console again, buy this for the Game Boy Player (add-on for the Gamecube).

Super Smash Bros......before it, there were fighting games like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Virtua Fighter. Their rules were a bit similar, and every fighting game was like that.......until Smash Bros came along!Super Smash Bros reinvented the rules of fighting games, combining platforming with fighting moves, such as punching, kicking, etc. What's even more of a no-brainer is how several Nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game. Each character has their own abilities, such as Mario throwing fireballs, and Fox using his laser gun.There are a variety of stages to choose from, and most of them have their own gimmicks. The Mushroom Kingdom (unlcokable) has pipes you can go into, and Pokemon Stadium lets you open a door that certain Pokemon pop out of and attack.The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles, like how fighting games usually are. Unfortunately, the rosters of the battles don't change.However, overall, you'll get a huge kick out of this game, especially when it comes to playing multiplayer. 4 players duking it out...what more can you ask for? Well, besides Brawl and Melee.

Mario Bros is another smash hit arcade game that helped Nintendo by a lot back in the day.You get to hit enemies from underneath them, and then kick 'em off the platforms!Things are especially fun in 2-Player mode, whereas Luigi shines in and helps out his big brother.Now this game is available at the palm of you hand. All you have to do is get these e-reader cards, scan them, and start playing.However, what kinda docked off a star is the fact that a new version of Mario Bros is packed in with every Mario Advance game and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, all of which are on the Game Boy Advance, like these e-reader cards.

Urban Champion is one of the many arcadey-styled NES games for the system. It doesn't really have any features, but the gameplay is just plain addicting.1-Player mode has you pit against a CPU player. You must punch him into a manhole to win, but that manhole's pretty far away. You have to keep punching him until he falls in. You can punch either in his face or in the gut. It depends on where he blocks himself.2-Player mode has the same setup, except that it's you're friend that you are facing.Oh yeah, and watch out for police. Who knows what they'll do if you get caught?When you win, I just find the scene to be funny, since someone from the building you're in front of cheers for your victory.Overall, it's a stellar fighting game that you might want to try out. But please note its lack of features.Now that it's on the GBA released in these cards, the appeal might increase.

Pac-Man for the Atari was criticized due to flickering ghosts and different graphics, sounds, and maze design. Ms. Pac-Man on the Atari, however, was more faithful to its arcade origin.The sounds, graphics, and gameplay were all identical, despite some parts of maze designs altered to fit in the Atari.

Gyromite is one of the NES launch titles made in 1985.It plays just like as if it was a classic arcade game, mainly because the goal and gameplay were simple: Collect all of the dynamite in the level to move on by moving across platforms and climbing ladders while avoiding dinosaurs.There is bait for the dinosaurs, fortunately, and if they eat the food, then you can walk by without dying.The main concept, however, is really interesting and innovative for its time. If you have R.O.B (Robotic Operating Buddy), then that peripheral can sorta help you out in this game. R.O.B's purpose in this game is that it can pick up and drop "gyros" on blue or red buttons. That way, the red and blue pipes in the game can move. The gyro must remain atop the button, though, because if it falls off, then the pipe moves back.R.O.B doesn't work too well, though. It's noisy and slow. There are times where that can have you trapped.Thankfully, you don't need R.O.B. You can also have a second player control the pipes instead. In fact, the 2-Player mode has you and your friend alternate roles each level.Overall, this is one heck of a classic. Despite its innovation, it takes you back to the arcades in a way.

The Mario Kart series has come pretty far since the original Super Nintendo game. So what must you expect from Mario Kart DS that you hadn't already seen in the other Mario Karts? A lot of things, actually.For the first time ever, Mario goes Wi-Fi in this cool kart racer! That's right! You can play online with 3 other people! Sure, that's not a lot, and the track selection is somewhat limited here, but just being able to actually play with people from across the world in the comfort of your home is incredibly appealing.Internet aside, there's still much more to enjoy here. The tracks here are as robust and colorful as ever! I mean, seriously. You can't possibly go wrong when it comes to racing through the likes of a giant pinball machine, or Luigi's very spooky mansion. Plus, Nintendo has also managed to revive a whole lot of tracks from previous Mario Kart games, including favorites like Double Dash's Baby Park, Super Circuit's Sky Garden, and MK64's Moo Moo Farm.The Battle mode is VERY lively here compared to other games! Here, you can actually play alone and battle 7 computer players, teams or not! Multiplayer is also a very nice option here, as well (Too bad only Local, though). Whether you're popping each other's balloons with items or stealing each other's Shine Sprites, there's surely some fun to be had.Here's a thought: Ever wanted to more than just race and battle with these karts? Well, Mario Kart DS introduces a new mode in which you complete MISSIONS to progress through (Sadly, this isn't in Mario Kart Wii or 3DS)! The missions give off even more variety, as if the regular tracks didn't offer that much, by giving you challenging tasks to do. There's also Boss Battling, as you must defeat bosses that try to literally attack you, popping the balloons you have. I bet you'd be at this for a while.Overall, Mario Kart DS has a unique value to it that other games don't really have. It is just as good as many of the other Mario Karts, and I totally recommend it for all Nintendo fans.

Many people should remember Frogger back in the day. It was a simple traffic-dodger starring an ordinary frog who wants to hop across the roads. Frogger 2, released 18 years later, stayed true to the addicting gameplay, but also added in cooler elements.There are 5 worlds in the game, with 7 levels in each (except the last one, which has 4). Each world seems to have unique gimmicks that make them stand out from each other. The first world has the classic traffic dodging that everybody should be familiar with, but then as the game progresses, there are newer patterns, as well as different obstacles to avoid.That makes the game a lot more fun in a way. And while all of these improvements to the gameplay take major effect, the game still sticks with Frogger's classic gameplay, as I already mentioned before. For some reason, there are also Guest and Visit Level modes.The Guest mode just has less features of what's included in save files. The Visit Level mode lets you...visit a level you already finished before. While I don't really know why there's a Visit Level mode, I just assume that...it's probably a Time Attack mode or something.But anyway, this is a must-have for the Game Boy Color, especially if you like the Frogger arcade game.

Now, don't be confused here. MegaMan for the Game Gear isn't a remake or port of the first game for NES, neither is it a port of the Game Boy version. Instead, this game contains bosses from MegaMan 4 and 5.The gameplay is just like as it was in the NES and Game Boy series. You face evil robot masters, and then before actually fighting one, you must go through a lengthy stage filled with challenge. And then after beating the robot master, you take their power. That sort of gameplay never gets old and is always fun.Here, the robot masters are Bright Man, Stone Man, Napalm Man, and Star Man (No relation to the power-up in the Mario series, obviously). The stages are just like as they were in the NES games. It's kind of like how the Game Boy series did it, but here, it's even closer to Mega Man 5 (and 4) on the NES.The game is just as good as the NES and Game Boy games. It's too bad that it was well forgotten due to how overlooked the Game Gear is.

Say you're back in 2004. You were psyched to buy the new Nintendo DS system. As you bought it, it came with a launch title. That launch title is...Super Mario 64 for the DS? Yeah, one of the launch titles is really a remake of an old Nintendo 64 game. But you know what's so great about it? That old Nintendo 64 game was one of the best games ever created, and having to experience it on a portable machine was a big thrill.This time, you start out playing as Yoshi. The other playable characters have to be unlocked. Fortunately, Yoshi isn't all that bad. Sure, he can't wall jump like Mario can or even punch, but he can eat up enemies and throw them as eggs! This can upset those with nostalgia, but at least it isn't long before you unlock Mario.Speaking of which, there are lots of new areas to play in. As you enter a new level to unlock a character, you'd end up discovering that there's more to it. You can find red coins, get a Star before it disappears, etc. Even though these levels are new, you'd still have that classic Mario 64 feel. Heck, there are also new missions. Do you remember collecting 5 Silver Stars, or, as already mentioned, race against time to snatch a star, or use Wario to break black bricks? I'm sure you don't. All of this results (Extra levels and missions) in 30 more Stars to collect in this already-big game.Another thing to enjoy is a nice selection of minigames. These can be unlocked by snatching rabbits with keys (instead of Stars), although there already are some minigames to choose from. These minigames play like arcade games: They go on and on, but they are very addicting, or at least, for some, they can go on if you let them.One problem that I find with the game is that there's no analog. For the most part, it plays fine without it, but when it comes to stuff like swinging Bowser's tail, it's just one of those instances where you think that the game should be played with analog and not a stylus or a D-Pad to make things a little easier. Another problem is the multiplayer. It's only a Vs mode, with you and your friend searching for Stars, or beating yourselves up to steal each others'. In early screenshots of the game, I see co-op multiplayer. It disappoints me to realize that you can't team up to fight Bowser in this final product.But overall, it was a fabulous start for the Nintendo DS. It's one of the best games I know, and having the game on the go only increases the fun I'd have with it. Let's not forget all of the new content, either.

Yes, I get it. This hailed from the 70s, where video games were as primitive as they could get. But it had some greats. Pong is an all-time classic, Asteroids and Space Invaders were pretty neat shooters, and Breakout.....was a game of Pong against a million bricks on a single screen.The idea is innovative at the time, but the execution is lacking. One can't possible have the attention span that this game requires for you to destroy every single block on the screen. Granted, there were new ways to play the game on this Atari 2600 cart. You could make it so you can catch the ball in your paddle, or you could steer the ball (Which half-works). This only changes how the ball bounce against the bricks, though, rather than the slow pace.What could have saved this game was its "Breakthru" mode. It allowed the ball to, instead of bounce off the blocks, go THROUGH them as they are destroyed! The pace went faster than ever, but it just so happens to go TOO fast. Literally. The ball somehow gains speed as it eats up the bricks. Once the ball bounces back toward the bottom of the screen, it could beat Sonic in a race. That's not fun for the player, but rather frustrating.

The Game Boy revolutionized handheld gaming, the Game Boy Color improved the Game Boy's game library and life span, and the Game Boy Advance blew the entire Game Boy line over the roof!(Let's be honest: We like the SP, not the original. Light is better than no light.)The Game Boy Advance is compatible with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but once again, it has a new library of games...and it had enough to make it as its own system. This magnificent 32-bit piece of awesomism has made it into our world in 2001, the year before the Color died away.Sadly, I never thought I'd see the day in which the GBA would fade away....Let's play some Super Mario Advance and battle each other in Mario Bros. What do ya say?

===Dr. Mario===When you think of Mario, you would, of course, think of his romping through the Mushroom Kingdom, stomping on baddies and rescuing Peach from Bowser. Are you going to expect the same thing from Dr. Mario? Actually, no.The game is a simple 4-in-a-row type of puzzler. You match up sides of vitamins to the colors of viruses or other pills. As simple as it sounds, like any puzzle game with a winning formula, it gets REALLY addicting. Dr. Mario contains 20 levels of virus-bustin' difficulty.===Puzzle League===This one's also a line-them-up kind of game, but as much as I wanted to like it as much as Dr. Mario, it seems to have a bit of a slower pace. It's still crazy fun. Just not AS much fun as Dr. Mario.I only give this collection a 4 stars because there isn't much to this other than the 2 games, obviously. What I mean is that there are better deals for the Game Boy Advance. Plus, the soundtrack in Dr. Mario is less robust here.

Ah, the Sega Saturn. When it came out, there was a HUGE price tag on it ($400), so thanks to other consoles at the time (Playstation and Nintendo 64), this thing quickly came and went. Well, not quick enough to have a very little amount of games. There was a colorful video game library for the Saturn. However...The games in general are a mix between bad and good. There were very great titles at the time, like Sonic Jam, Rayman, Mortal Kombat II, Sonic 3D Blast (though the lack of a save feature's a big flaw), and even the MegaMan X series arrived onto it. Unfortunately, there were bad games, such as Double Switch and Sonic R.Not only that, but it feels like a majority of the good games are on other systems anyway. The games I named off the bat sure are. 3D Blast was on the Genesis, MK2 was on everything, Rayman was on Playstation, PC, and even the Atari Jaguar, and Sonic Jam was a collection of already-released Genesis titles. The MegaMan X series, of course, is also on other systems.To be fair, those games do help bring life into the Saturn, anyway. It wouldn't be a bad idea to go ahead and buy this system, but there may be a possibility of running low on exclusive titles after buying just a few.

Pac-Man Adventures in Time.....IS SUCH AN OVERLOOKED GAME!!People have got to play this thing!It's all the action you expect from the original arcade classics, but 100 times better. It's like the Sonic CD of the Pac-Man series. Is that saying much? Well lemme tell you this:You play as the used-to-be-modern Pac-Man and go around eating dots being chased by ghosts in over 100 mazes with several different environments in-game. There are also some minigames, extra mazes, and cutscenes. All of which you can unlock once you reach them.A majority of mazes have their own gimmicks. Want me to name some? Swimming, gravity shoes, lasers shooting at you, boulders rolling down, mine cart, ETC.It also has some multiplayer modes, and (Drum roll please?) ONLINE PLAY. That's right. You can play online!Overall, you know what I want you to do. Now GO DO IT!

The Super Monkey Ball series made a pretty sweet debut on the good ol' Gamecube. But apparently, somebody had the idea of bringing the experience on the GO! It's not today in which the games are mere iPhone apps. Back then, it was kinda revolutionary to bring the experience to a handheld system. Sega bravely handled it well.The game does an amazing job at replicating the looks of the console games (if not a bit pixelated). Sometimes, I felt as if the GBA was secretly connected to my Gamecube wirelessly or something, because the graphics are THAT advanced.But enough about looking pretty. It's the game that matters, not the sprinkles. That said, the concept of tilting the entire playing field to move your Monkey Ball to the goal translates onto here flawlessly. In fact, the game really gets you thinking. There are oh so many opportunities in which you have to wisely plan your way through. This creates a big challenge factor for the game. The difficulty fairly ramps up after each level, and BOY do you need to plan some strategy! The result is addicting and fun.

The Game Boy Advance is one of the best portable systems Nintendo has ever produced (especially SP). It lets you play your Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but it has its own huge library of Game Boy Advance games. The GBA SP adds a backlight to the system, as well as a better look.The Game Boy Micro is where a tough spot hits the Game Boy line. The GBM can't play the original Game Boy and Color games.It may have a cool Game & Watch look, but if you can't play Game Boy and Color games on it and only GBA games, then why not get a Nintendo DS instead? That system can let you play GBA games, but it suffers from the same lack of GBC (Color/Original) compatibility.

First of all, forget about the first Mario Party. Let's go straight to the sequel. Now, Mario Party 2 is considered to be the best of all the games in the series, and for great reason: There are lots of memorable minigames, catchy tunes, and fun virtual game boards. There are six boards, and there are about 50 minigames (I think).This game capitalized the board game-minigame hybrid. Now you find other board games with the word "Party" because of this game.Basically, you must go get Stars, but you need coins to pay for the Stars. Whoever has the most Stars wins. Every turn, there would be a minigame. Whoever wins the minigame gets 10 coins.The minigames have their own rules that separate from each other. You can read them in-game.There are also some more minigames that you can buy with a Mushroom piggy bank, which collects the coins you earned during the main game.There are some other game modes that have you fight to the finish by playing the minigames.Some of the minigames may be boring, but the huge majority of them are just plain fun. And also, who could forget the cannonballs that shoot you off the bridges at Pirate Land? Or how about the Bowser Parade in Bowser Land (unlockable board)?Overall, if you are looking for a really awesome board game (as well as a good minigame collection), you NEED this in your game library.

Mortal Kombat 2, at first, is pretty difficult to handle on PC. Why? Well, You gotta either play this on Windows XP, a DOS computer, or run it via a DOS emulator. Playing it on the XP seems to cause it to lose the sound department, because I can't really hear any sound effects or music. There may be a solution to that, but I may as well stick with the DOS emulator.The controls were weird, too. I, J, K, and L were used for movement, and Q, A, and E were for attacks. Thankfully, you can get used to it easily.As for the game itself...The gameplay is one-on-one fighting at perhaps its finest. You choose from a wide selection of characters, and then you duke it out with one of them. Fighting moves include punching, kicking, uppercutting, and you can even use moves exclusive to the character. It's kinda like how the average awesome fighter has things laid out. It is incredibly fun and it would always keep you playing.The graphics are freaking epic. Not only are the characters played by actors and digitized, but there's blood and gore, AND the fighting arenas are full of interesting scenery.The music is pretty neat, but it appears to be in kinda of a lower quality than how the Super NES handles music. It sounds Sega Genesis-ish, but the tunes are still cool. Sadly, you'd be concentrating on the fighting, and given how the sound effects are being heard as you smack the opponent to a pulp, it's like as if you'd forget there's music. That happens in almost every fighting game you can imagine existed.But Mortal Kombat II still shines on DOS. Definitely play this classic, even if you'll be playing it on another system.

Sonic: The Movie is a direct-to-video movie which tells about Dr. Robotnik having to create Metal Sonic and kidnap Sarah (A human girl with a monkey tail. The reason why she's created is unknown). Sonic and Tails have to stop him again and crush Metal.Like how a game-based movie SHOULD be, the movie follows the games' plot faithfully, and it's an animated movie, so the characters look familiar and are easy to identify.The movie has several comedy bits, so it might be even more easier for you to enjoy it.Some might say the voices are terrible, but I kinda like 'em.Overall, the movie had made the blue blur proud. However, try to find this movie at a lower price than $60.

For what it is, GameRoom has nailed the basic needs using its decent collection of table games. The available games are Air Hockey, Table Tennis, Shuffleboard, Pool, Darts, and....Pinball. All of the games work and play really well and are pretty fun. I also noticed that there's an online function for competing against others with the Internet.The game that stands out from the rest, though, is Pinball. Why? Because it's not just a pinball simulator. It's Sierra's 3D ULTRA PINBALL THRILLRIDE!It was previously released as its own disk and Game Boy Color cartridge, but now you don't have to worry about the game being too expensive alone. I'm not sure if there are any features taken out of this version, but I assure you that it's still incredibly fun and this collection could actually be worth it just for ThrillRide alone! See my review of 3D Ultra Pinball ThrillRide if you're still not sure about buying this. While the other games in this compilation are fun, too, I'd prefer this pinball game over all of em.

If you are one to have grown up during the days of the arcades or the NES, then you will surely love this book. It's a collection of painted up parodies of video game moments, if not video games themselves. Open this up, and you will see Mario and Donkey Kong have beer with each other, a little girl using Kirby as a balloon, an old crazy-lookin' Link, and Ms. Pac-Man taking a joyride on the ship from Galaga!The pictures are downright humorous and/or inspirational. You won't be disappointed when you look at even just a few pictures. Be warned, though, that I happened to accidentally stumble upon a couple painted nude pictures...You'll thank me for this.But still, this is an excellent book! Definitely a must-have for any 80s/90s gamer!

You know, I was talking with my former science teacher (Who grew up in the NES era) about Super Castlevania 4 today, and how much fun the game was. Apparently, he told me he doesn't remember playing that one. He said he gave up on the series due to this sore thumb. According to him, he paid a big $40 for the game (I guess that's the standard price of NES games then), and the result was a boring/confusing sequel that didn't live up to the original.Of course, I wouldn't be writing this review if I hadn't played it myself, but I still gotta agree with him. Castlevania 2 isn't about linear action platforming fun. Instead, it's about whipping monsters for hearts to purchase items and conquering lying civilians to progress forward. On top of that, the level design is bland, bland, bland. There isn't too much of a variety of anything (mainly enemies) when going anywhere.Since there are certain areas to go, you may as well listen to what the non-playable characters have to say, right? No. They actually happen to lie at times. Unbelievable, right? How can you play a game that you definitely need tips on what to do if you get the wrong tips? As much as I would want to go get Nintendo Power issue #2 for help, it costs a hefty $40+ on Amazon (go figure..). Maybe there's a scan floating around on the Internet, but it is still inexcusable for Konami to release Castlevania 2 as is. And don't get me started on when the in-game day turns night...That's not to say there was no fun factor or appeal at all. The graphics are still fantastic, and the music is awesome. The classic Castlevania whipping action, although bombarded by everything above, is still there, and still fun to do. Had there been even more work done on this game, this would've been an absolute masterpiece.

Remember when Cartoon Network used to have such a huge variety of different cartoons? Those were certainly good times when I was growing up (I'm 15 now). I watched a lot of great cartoons back then - Billy and Mandy, Ed Edd n Eddy, Johnny Bravo, Dexter, The Powerpuff Girls......All of them were awesome. Unfortunately, times passed and CN got rid of all its greats....Until Cartoon Planet was revived and now airs every Friday. It gave me an opportunity to watch my favorites again. And now that I saw the Powerpuff Girls brought back too, I'm really starting to get back to loving it again.The Powerpuff Girls is a really unique show in which it features..well..heroines that go to kindergarten, and the main villain is a lab monkey! The whole show features intentional silliness that I just can't resist laughing with! There's no way one should really take it all seriously.The characters are filled with personalities! The 3 girls, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are all adorable and silly. Blossom has that leadership role, Bubbles always seems to be a more innocent being, and Buttercup has a love for violence. The mayor is loony, the professor behaves like a gentleman, and there are just SO much more when it comes to this subject.Anyway, it's not just the silliness that The Powerpuff Girls relies on. There's also a great amount of hilarious jokes (as well as some clever running gags) in every episode that just make the overall show very funny. The jokes range from minor (Blossom: How do YOU know I won't lie? - Mojo Jojo: Because you're Blossom) to major jokes relating to the episode they occur to running gags within character personalities (Such as Buttercup's love for violence, and Ms. Bellum's face is never seen).There are also some fast-paced action scenes in a way in which I've never seen mimicked on any other show. They are pretty flashy, but in a way in which it's also very satisfying. I guess you just gotta see for yourself if you want to know what I'm trying to say...But overall, The Powerpuff Girls is a great show with a sharp sense of humor. Nowadays, the main "girly show" with a male audience is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. However, there's a term used for those people ("brony"), and it just feels kinda disappointing to see that word exists. Fortunately, there's no similar term for The Powerpuff Girls, so there's no shame in loving the show if you're a boy like I am. It's sad to see it off regular Cartoon Network, but there are still plenty of opportunities to watch it.A) Tune in to CN's Cartoon Planet at 8:00 PM (eastern time) and hope the show will airB) Tune in to the channel, Boomerang, and watch episodes daily at 11:00 PM (eastern time)C) Buy this DVD, which contains every single episode.

Rayman is awesome. The PC/PS1/Atari/Saturn classic now returns onto a handheld system....again. But this time, everything is how you would remember it in the original (Well, almost everything). Sure, the limitations of the Game Boy Advance brought down a bit of the quality in the game's music, but the tunes are still cool to listen to.Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP&lt; being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was this only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Game Boy Advance lying around.

You've probably seen how revolutionary Super Mario 64 was on the Nintendo 64. Well, imagine if the game was separated into mini planets, and you see Mario soaring through the air as he was launched into the air. That, my friends, is Mario Galaxy.The game starts out with Mario roaming through a gorgeously detailed Mushroom Kingdom as he runs to Peach's Castle...for cake. But then, guess what? Not only does Bowser kidnap Peach again. He kidnaps Peach in a very epic cutscene! Unfortunately for Mario, a Magikoopa sends him flying into the galaxy, knocking him out.Now, the main game is playing through very big and graphical 3D worlds bouncing on Goombas, collecting coins, and all kinds of other stuff. But, like Super Mario 64, you must collect Stars. Collect enough Stars to be able to play in another world, or maybe have Mario tussle with Bowser. If you were to play the game, you'll notice that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is much, much deeper and more fun than I am describing it.The music is nothing like I've ever heard in a Mario game. I mean, seriously. Once I played the game until after I beat the first Bowser boss, I was thinking "Oh, my god. These tracks are from a MARIO game??". The music also breathes air into the spacey atmosphere in the game.The one major complaint I have with this game is that the 2-Player mode is stupid. There's almost nothing the second player can do to help the first player play through the game. Sure, he/she can collect Star Bits, launch them at enemies, and fling those...rubber..trees at enemies. But that's pretty much it. The second player doesn't even have his/her own character (Thanks, Mario Galaxy 2).But other than the 2-Player mode, the game is amazing. It is one of the best Wii games you can buy.Oh, and Spoiler Alert: Luigi is playable after you collect all 121 Stars, in case you didn't know.

Right off the bat, before it came out, you'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D. Well, here's your answer: Mario 64.There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars), with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time, no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now, they were still eye candy for most Mario fans, especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera, flawless control, and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge. (SPOILER ALERT) If you do manage to get them all, you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall, you know what I want you to do, so do it. Buy the game

In 1983, the Mario Bros arcade game was released. Along with the awesome arcade game, a Game & Watch version was made. That Game & Watch version, however, had different gameplay. It was the only Game & Watch game to be ported onto a console. That console is the Commodore. However, it was unofficially ported by "the Riffs". Since the original Mario Bros was already ported to Commodore, they had to call the Game & Watch game Mario Bros II.Instead of knocking enemies off of platforms after hitting them from underneath, you must put boxes onto conveyor belts. The machinery would supply the boxes with glass bottles. You must control both Mario and Luigi at the same time (Although it's okay to ask another player to play with you). The last conveyor belt will load the boxes onto a truck. If the truck is full, you'll get extra points and then the truck will drive away, later coming back with an empty back.That was how the handheld Game & Watch game went. The Commodore 64 port (Mario Bros II) made no difference in gameplay.The graphics barely changed, but now Mario and Luigi are dressed like how they were in the Mario Bros arcade game. The main screen has been split-screened to show the title on top of the game. Things are now animated. The music is half-bad, half-good, depending on whether you like these 8-bit tunes.Overall, it's a nicely done port of the Mario Bros Game & Watch game. It's the only unofficial sequel to the arcade classic, and it's worth getting.

Kong Strikes Back. With a name like that, you're sure to realize that it's yet another ripoff of Donkey Kong's concept. Well, you're in for a surprise in this one.Kong Strikes Back is a great example of an old game concept on steroids. Kong has captured the girl, and you must save her...but on the way, you must avoid getting run over by cars, mine carts, and Merry-Go-Round horses!Unlike Donkey Kong, you can't jump. You must use the ladders to avoid the rushing cars. You can also use bombs to blow them up! But beware: You only have 4 bombs to use each level.Like Donkey Kong, the game cycles through four different level over and over until you get a Game Over, a tradition in 80s arcade games. The levels take some time to memorize the patterns. Blow certain cars up and climb up certain ladders.Once you get hit, you bounce all around the screen! Who ever thought of that idea? The imagination concept is just overflowing in this game. In level 4 (times 1, times 2, etc), Kong is on top of, as mentioned up above, a Merry-Go-Round. Along with dodging cars, you must also avoid contact with the fake horses! Of all the things you can possibly imagine, Kong Strikes Back includes cars replacing barrels and a Merry-Go-Round instead of something more dramatic, like a factory! And instead of hammers, do you get wrenches? Mallets? Nope. BOMBS!Overall, it's a decent Donkey Kong clone that digs a hole in your brain.

Well...it's no surprise anymore that Donkey Kong that Donkey Kong had a couple copycats, like Cargo Kong (Game by Sega. Concept's the same) and Crazy Kong by Falcon (which was a bootleg of DK). However, since when was there KONGO KONG??? What kind of name is that?! How last-minute.At least the sounds/music are decent. And while the graphics could use some more effort, they're excusable. The control is playable, and not horrid like in Crazy Kong 64 (Not by Falcon).Like Donkey Kong, the gameplay is kind of the same and there are four different levels. The game is rather closer to the NES/Japanese version of the arcade DK, since those versions go by the level order instead of having to make players face the blue level before unlocking a new level.The first level is pretty basic. Just jump over enemies and/or barrels to get to the girl. However, once you save her, you fly up to the next level. What the heck? I expected Kongo to go snatch her away to the next level. Why is the character FLYING UP to the next level?! There needs to be an explanation.The second level is where new concepts take place. Here, there's a big object that tries to suck you towards it. So what you gotta do is climb your way up to the top and not fall for the big gaps. However, it is like a punch to the shoulder when you have to jump over an enemy while you're being sucked up. You'll either get hit, or be able to understand the object's pattern and live.The third level has another gimmick. But this time, it helps you. There are REALLY big gaps that you can't jump over. So what do you do? Hitch a ride on a hook that rushes by.The fourth level gives you a flashback. That is, if you've played Donkey Kong. You have to push all the buttons to actually defeat Kongo. It's just like how Mario runs over those yellow platforms in Donkey Kong to cut down the girders, except you don't run over buttons. However, you have to jump ONLY if you move all the way towards the button to push it.And now you see the ending. The girders fall, Kongo falls, and you and the girl SOMEHOW STILL FLOAT IN THE AIR. Once that passes, the game takes you to a newer difficulty setting, just like Donkey Kong does.Overall, it isn't bad. Let it pass. The badly set-up cutscenes don't really affect my passion for this game by much, and of course, this is on Commodore 64.

Mario Kart 64 is the true 3D Nintendo 64 sequel to Super Mario Kart. Since the characters wouldn't look so great on karts in 3D on the N64, the sprites are in 2D, which explains how they are fully detailed.There are 16 courses you can race in, along with 4 courses for your average Battle Mode.Now that there are 4 players, the 2-4 Player modes can be pretty fun, especially 2-Player since it has all the options from 1-Player Mode.The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart, but it's fun to use them all.Overall, Mario Kart 64 is another game that defines 3D gaming on the Nintendo 64.

Ever since Super Mario Kart came and went, it seems like everyone wanted to their own version of that mascot-racer concept. After all, Crash Bandicoot went there, Sonic went there, and even Rayman and Digimon had done that same thing! So, what can we expect from Pac-Man, now that he's getting that idea? Well.........it's actually a very good game.The courses in the game are very fun to race in and are extremely creative. In fact, there are courses based off the Pac-Man arcade game and Katamari! They seem like as they would give Mario Kart a run for its money.The soundtrack is also awesome. However, the sound effects in-game prevent people from getting to listen. Thankfully, there's an option to make the music louder or lower the volumes of the SFX.One thing that kills the experience, though, is the item selection. They pretty much serve their purposes as Mario Kart's Koopa shells. You throw them at opponents, and watch them blow up to stun them for a bit. The items just don't feel as robust as Mario Kart's. Fortunately, if you collect enough Pac-dots on the roads, you can transform into a robotic Pac-Man that can eat other opponents!The one other problem is that this can only be played alone or with another friend. No 3 or 4 player modes here.But overall, this is still a very fun kart-racer. It's no Mario Kart: Double Dash, but it's a good game in its own right.

Alright. I had no idea what to expect from Mortal Kombat Advance. I loved the series from MK1 to its fourth game on the N64 and Playstation. Then there's this....Okay...Maybe I should mention that I loved the CONSOLE GAMES. The only handheld game I like in the series is Mortal Kombat 2 for the Game Boy.So, I was treated with a rather glorious presentation. The graphics are still really colorful on the Game Boy Advance, and the sound is top-notch. Oh, and there's a huge variety of characters, including the off-beat versions of some of them from MK3. Oh GOD does it fall from there.Since I was new to this particular game, I tried the "Warrior" (aka Normal) difficulty. MY BUTT WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY SCORPION THE SECOND I CAME IN. Not once did I even inflict damage on him, and I was trying the hardest as possible to even give the tiniest bit of damage!Apparently, I knew I couldn't handle that difficulty. The next logical thing to do was try the "Novice" difficulty. After all, that is the easiest difficulty setting available at all, right?Okay...I'm not making this up: It. Didn't. Change. A. Freaking. THING. This game is impossible! It's at the same standards of horrendous as Dragon's Lair on the NES!! Do NOT play this! It's a total waste of money. Avoid it and play something better! Like...MK: Deadly Alliance on the GBA. Same system, totally better game.

Mario Kart: Super Circuit is the first time the Mario Kart series came onto the Game Boy. It is also the first game in the series to have a subtitle with the actual title. Once more, it is also the first Mario Kart game to have retro courses. Don't believe me? Then skip down to the near-bottom of this review.Instead of having the same gameplay as Mario Kart 64, however, the game uses the original Super Nintendo game's gameplay and performs a major twist in it.The graphics are awesome. For the characters, they are taken right out of Mario Kart 64, but everything else is new and a sight for sore eyes.You get to start with 16 courses (The Special Cup is locked). Each course seems to have their own gimmicks, with the exception of some. The courses are greatly detailed and their designs are kinda clever.The music in the game is unlike the other Mario Kart games. Although some of the soundtrack is Mario Kart-worthy, there are several songs that doesn't fit in, yet you'd love to listen to the music. Such examples are Boo Lake, Ribbon Road, Snow Land, and the game's Rainbow Road.When racing on a track, you'll always find coins. At first glance, they look pointless to collect. But guess what? You need them. If you have no coins and someone bumps into you, you'll spin out. What's cool about the coins is that when you finish a cup with over 100 coins, you get to unlock a cup from the original Super Mario Kart! Nostalgia just beats like a human heart right there. When you enter the Cup menu, just press L or R and then it will switch to the Super Mario Kart tracks. The graphics aren't from the Super Nintendo game, though, but the tracks still play like how they used to be.With 20 new courses and 20 ones that were brought back, this game will last for a long while.

You know, ever since the original Super Smash Bros, it was unbelievable to imagine several of Nintendo's franchises coming together and beat the ever-loving heck out of each other. The result was one of the best multiplayer experiences around. Then Melee came by and improved upon every single aspect of the original, as well as introducing things like Events, an Adventure Mode, and an All-Star mode. OH MY GOD!!! WHAT THE HECK IS BRAWL GONNA BRING US?! Just keep reading and you'll be shocked (That is, if you don't already own the game).Already, the character lineup is STUNNING. You've got characters from series like Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Pokemon, etc (And this should already appeal to fans everywhere), and now there are even MORE additions! Wouldn't you believe that Nintendo actually managed to bring SONIC and Metal Gear's SNAKE into the action! HOLY SHOOT! Can you imagine Mario and Sonic fighting evil side by side? Or maybe you can make them fight each other as if it is the Sega Vs Nintendo era all over again? The possibilities are endless!Speaking of endless possibilities, there's a freaking Stage Builder! This means you get to make your very own fighting arenas! Granted, there's limited things to put in, but just the privilege of being able to make levels can really keep you hyped! Look on the bright side: If you don't like the gimmicky fights in Brawl's own stages, you can just make your own.The stages themselves are extremely detailed and very creative! The gimmicks in each level help add to the intense fighting action. For example, in WarioWare Inc., (Which itself is a stage based off a minigame series, and it's very faithful. That alone deserves some praise) the players can actually compete in the minigames while fighting to earn prizes like temporary invincibility (Starman), or grow bigger!The Event Match mode from Melee has returned here, but this time, there are also events in which you and a friend could play together! Classic mode and All-Star mode also return, and of course, while they haven't truly changed, they certainly seem much better here, considering the amazing selections of characters and stages.Here's a cute bonus: Nintendo actually threw in demos of classic video games into Brawl! In the Masterpieces section, you can find trials of games such as Kirby's Adventure, Super Mario World, Ice Climber, F-Zero, Star Fox 64, etc.But that bonus is terribly pathetic compared to the game's Adventure mode! Aka the Subspace Emissary, this may as well have been sold off as its own game, but NO! Nintendo put this in as a BONUS! Think a game in which characters from several Nintendo franchises have come together and join forces to stop an evil demon-like creature that's messing with their world. THIS is that game! Sure, you are forced to play as certain characters at first (Like Mario or Pit from Kid Icarus), but eventually, you'll be loaded with almost all of the available characters in the game that you can choose from. There are also some amazing encounters with familiar good/bad guys as they are also involved with this epic plot (There is a part in which Fox and Diddy Kong fight the Pokemon, Rayquaza!). The Great Maze (Which is at the near-end of the game) left me grumbling, as it was very confusing to get past, but overall, I'm loving this!In case if you thought all of this was enough, think again; there's also online play. You can play online multiplayer against other people! Whether it's a 2 on 2 team match or every player for him/herself, I bet you'd have a very fun time playing! The only problem, though, is that the game sorta lags depending on how far away the players are from where you live. Also, the controls are slightly delayed, but fortunately, you can easily get used to it.There are other modes that I haven't really talked about for this review (Like Breaking Targets, Home-Run Contest, and Multi-Man Melee in which you fight a big number of easy-to-defeat polygonal characters), but this is already such a huge package that I'm sure you don't even need me to discuss them!Overall, there's a lot to love here for Nintendo fans. Heck, even if you AREN'T a Nintendo fan, I bet this game would get you interested! Plus, even if some game modes weren't really too great for you, there's still so much content that you'd enjoy otherwise that you might never get bored from this game! No Wii owner's library is complete without this game!

Before he had starred in his own platforming adventures, and a little after he made his first appearance in Super Mario World, Yoshi was the main character of a good amount of spin-offs (Mainly puzzlers). The game that shares Yoshi's name is one of those puzzle games, but it's actually executed pretty well, and knowing Nintendo, you would expect that.Like Tetris, Yoshi has a single-player mode and a 2-Player versus mode. Both make for incredibly addicting experiences! You can stack up 2 of the signature Mario enemies of the same type (Goomba, Boo, Piranha Plant, and Blooper) to make them disappear, OR for a much more amusing situation, you could stack up the enemies atop the bottom half of an egg, and place the upper half on top of it all. Suddenly, BOOM, the enemies have been CRAMMED into an egg!As for the versus mode, you know what to expect when it comes to a puzzle game containing this feature. Make as much enemy sandwiches as possible, causing the other player to be given a certain obstacle, and so on.So, if you have a puzzle itch to scratch, Yoshi is right up your alley. You don't even need to be a fan of the Mario series to like this game!

Admit it: You love playing those Skee Ball games that have been in nearly every arcade that's ever existed. Well, we are all in luck now, aren't we? Released a long while ago, Bull's-Eye Ball is just as fun as the average Skee Ball game. Heck, I think it might be even better.You must score as much points as possible by bouncing the balls onto the little built-in trampoline (Twist on the ol' formula!) as they fall into 3 holes. Of course, like regular Skee Ball, the higher the hole is, the more points you get. I think the result is much more addicting than Skee Ball ever really was.I mean, come on! It's Skee Ball in your house. And with a small trampoline built-in! To top it all off, you get to carry this thing wherever you go.

I've reviewed the later-released Game Boy Advance version of this game a while back, but this is THE real deal. I may have recommended the other version, but this original is infinitely better, making the other one look like crap. My Playstation library certainly isn't big, but I know for a fact that you need this game!First off, the presentation is top-notch. You are treated to a couple 3D-animated FMV cutscenes. And then, BAM! As soon as the level begins, you wander at the amazingly colorful graphics, catchy lighthearted music, and as you start playing, the gameplay will get you hooked.The gameplay is somewhat basic. You can run, jump, Rev Roll (Like Sonic 2's spin dash move), and throw the Pac-Dots you eat to create small explosions. Fortunately, it actually makes for a very fun time, especially as you progress through the levels. There are lots of tweaks in each level, filling things up with neat detail and differentiation. It could be a little hard to judge distance for where you would land after jumping, but you'll get used to it quickly.The bosses are surprisingly VERY HARD! Unless you go onto YouTube or something to see how people beat the bosses, chances are, you'll be wasting a good amount of lives. But let me tell you this: King Galaxian is THE BEST BOSS LEVEL EVER! It changes the whole gameplay, letting you control a spaceship instead (a la Galaxian and Galaga) and shoot rows of alien ships! And then comes the boss itself, which still throws bad guys at ya, but also tries to suck your ship toward it (Galaga). Throughout all that, the music and even just the concept of the level makes up for what may possibly be a little frustrating boss fight.Overall, this is a true must-have. It's a game with some of the best music, graphics, and gameplay all around that a Pac-Man game could ever offer.

Ms. Pac-Man, another smash hit in the arcades, comes to the Game Boy (again) in style. This time, it's in a 2-in-1 cartridge with Super Pac-Man, another addicting arcade hit (Although not as much a hit as Ms. Pac-Man).The graphics, sounds, and gameplay for both games are identical to their bigger-screened counterparts.Ms. Pac-Man actually has a few extra mazes, but it takes a long time to reach them.Since both games are fun and addicting, the cartridge gets 5 stars.

The iconic yellow muncher has made a second leap to Game Boy, but with a lesser-known great by its side: Pac-Attack.Pac-Man is that fun and addicting arcade game you'd play at your local video arcade.Eat the dots, munch the ghosts, finish the mazes, you know the drill!Pac-Attack is a Tetris-inspired puzzle game where, after certain blocks, you must guide Pac-Man to where there's a line of ghosts to eat up. You can also clear lines like in Tetris. There's also a Puzzle Mode where you HAVE to eat all the ghosts. If Pac-Man misses, one Pac-Man is docked off. You would normally start with 3 per level (Or is it 5?).Overall, I recommend you get this portable classic.

Ms. Pac-Man is awesome. Arcade games are awesome. Arcade games ported to home consoles are AWESOME.The Commodore 64 version is faithful to the arcade game, but it isn't really so great.The graphics are really great on the Commodore, and the sound is good, considering the hardware.The one thing that docked points off, though, was the control scheme. If you don't have a joystick, then you'll be trapped by the ghosts very quickly. Pressing Backspace to move up and Enter to move down glitches up Ms. Pac-Man for you. YOU NEED THE JOYSTICK. Otherwise, you'll end up looking at laughable movements.At least this version is better than the dumb NES port.

How do you make an incredibly amazing game collection? Take Super Mario Bros 1-3, throw in the Lost Levels, upgrade them with newer graphics, sounds, and a couple features, and BAM! You get one of the best game collections around. If you don't feel like getting this original version online, buy Super Mario All-Stars for Wii. It's coming in December 12th, with soundtrack on a CD, a Mario history book, and the collection itself.

Pac-Man, before Donkey Kong, was an even bigger smash hit in the arcades.The NES port of the game does pretty well.The graphics, sounds, and gameplay are all at least the same as the original arcade game.Unlike Donkey Kong for NES, however, people will always find this game to be more addicting.No matter how many times Pac-Man was ported into several other consoles, there's nothing like popping in a Pac-Man cartridge into an 80s console like the NES.

Popeye is an arcade game based off of the old television cartoon show (which is still being watched on Boomerang, by the way). While the game didn't really grow as popular as games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, it was a cult classic.You play as Popeye, and you must catch whatever Olive throws down (Hearts, music notes, H E L P letters). Each level has Olive throwing down different things. Of course, there's also Bluto trying to get in your way. If you get close to him, it's likely that he will throw wine bottles at you. You gotta break them by punching them. If you get farther in the game, a witch would probably come and throw skulls at you, too.Each level has different gimmicks. The first has nothing, actually. The second level has a seesaw you can use to reach a platform unreachable by doing everything else. The third level shows Olive being captured by a bird. The bird is another obstacle which you can hurt by punching.Overall, it is a great arcade game and the Atari 2600 version is no disappointment.

Super Mario World is the best Mario game of all time, and with great reason: Although people prefer Mario 3 over World, SMW fixed what we (or I) had to complain about in 3. The game continued on to become the best-selling 16-bit game.Super Mario 3 is great, but Mario World improved some faults and added better things that made this game more superior:-Yoshi-Cape power-up-Saving/Loading-Less auto-scrolling levels-etcThe game lasts really long, and it is always fun, even after it is beaten.In fact, this GBA version includes more than what meets the eye. The differences between this and the original are:-Closer camera view (Something I forgot to mention in my Mario Advance 1 review) for the GBA-Lighter color palliate-Small color differences (Not including lighter palliate)-Voices-Get to play as an updated Luigi-Yoshi colors are now unlockable. After discovering a color, you must hit a Yoshi block with a certain power-up to get that Yoshi-New "Beat all levels" kind of quest to unlock the alternate version of Dinosaur World-Level select after beating the game once. Just press Select-The updated version of Mario Bros carried over from the first Super Mario AdvanceLike I said just now, this game also includes the GBA version of Mario Bros, where you actually get to run, throw Pow blocks, and play as the Mario from Super Mario 2.The multiplayer modes are also present. You can play with or against a friend, collecting 5 coins, or just sabotaging him/her.

Granted, it's a platformer with Bugs Bunny stapled onto it. But what's really important (At least for me) is that the platforming actually works out fine. Plus, while the enemies do look like they've been thought up at the last minute, the graphics look pretty good. The music is also as catchy (Although somewhat repetitive at certain levels) as that of Mario music.What I find interesting about the game is that there are actually some minor twists added into the never-tiring formula that make this pretty unique. Examples include seesaws, blocks broken with Bugs's hammer, and carrot blocks (when collected) turning into platforms. But even without those gimmicks, it's still kinda nice to play a good NES platformer when given the chance. Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout certainly would fill that need.The Bugs Bunny license may not have been used well in this game (Heck, any video game character could star in something like this), and the bonus stages (In which you either mash buttons for luck or play Whack a Mole) sorta suck, but this is still not that bad of an NES title. I love the Angry Video Game Nerd and everything, but this is one game he's ranted on that I would actually like to play.

Scott Pilgrim Vs The World has it all: It's got romance, comedy, action, and parodies of video games that came and went.At first, I felt like the movie was going kinda off due to how Scott transitioned into another thing he partakes in. I assume it meant how the day was passing by.But the movie was already off to such a great start. You have already heard several humorous jokes, and you've also heard some nods to games like Zelda.Once Scott has been with Romona Flowers, though, that's where the movie seriously picks up! It turns out that she had dated seven evil boyfriends in the past, all of which made of the League of Evil Exes. Yeah, I see you chuckling at your computer. Don't hide it.The action scenes where Scott fights them are both funny and cool. You just wonder how the effects were done throughout the movie. They make it look like a live-action video game. Even when Scott defeats one of the Exes, he (The ex) turns into coins and then the screen says "2000" points, or whatever number is used.While the action scenes are thrilling, the comedy will keep you laughing for as long as you live. For example, in a scene where Scott finds out that his ex-girlfriend, Knives, is dating his friend, Neil, his head shows a meter that shows what he should say at the moment. It pointed between a compliment and "I gotta pee". The result made Scott say, "I gotta pee on her"! Gross? I guess, but it's so random that it's funny.The romance scenes actually kinda speak to the audience in a way in which it tells how hard it may be to either break up with somebody or not. You might not know what to do if you run into that kind of situation.The game parodies range from minor to brief. There is this one scene where Scott plays a ninja version of Dance Dance Revolution with Knives. He tells her how Pac-Man was originally going to be called Puck-Man, and why that was changed. Also, I still can't get over how amazing the effects are. They help add to the parodies at times, including the deaths of the Exes. There are also some sound effects that come from certain games people will recognize, such as the ring sound from the Sonic series, and when you get an item in Zelda: A Link to the Past.All in all, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World helped the comic book series become reimagined into a live-action thrill that appeals to almost everybody.

When little SMB Madman played Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze, I pretty much thought "Hey, another Pac-Man game!" I just thought it would play like old arcade-style Ms. Pac-Man. Fortunately, that's what I got, but UNfortunately, that's ALL I got. I didn't care, but looking at it now....It seemed like it was following behind Pac-Man: Adventures in Time, but unlike that game, this game isn't so great. The environments are all the same dull pyramid-like look. The mazes aren't any more intriguing than the bonus mazes you get to find in the Pac-Man World games. To top it all off, the music is just plain repetitive, and the one tune (So I remember) plays throughout the game.It's nice to see that there's a 2-Player mode, but that's one of the few good things it has to offer. If you can tolerate the blandness of the game, then I GUESS you can notice that it still is classic Pac-Man.......Classic Pac-Man that's hampered by all this junk.

This version of Donkey Kong Jr is the Game & Watch version, which is obviously based off the arcade version.Mario has captured Donkey Kong, and you, as his son, must save him.Although this version has one level, it's extremely addicting to play. As Klap Traps come toward you, you either climb vines or drop fruit on them. Then you must grab the key (Which is dangling from a tree) to save your daddy.

It was 2001. SEGA's console department fell apart. The Dreamcast was pretty awesome, but when it came down to the Nintendo 64, Playstation 1 & 2, and the Xbox all together, it seems like SEGA couldn't keep up with them, as the company began to turn into a third-party developer/publisher. So what do they do? THEY MAKE A SONIC GAME ON THE NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE (With publishing help from THQ)! How cool is that?! Sonic has arrived onto a Nintendo system! Sure, Sonic Adventure 2 on the Gamecube may have technically been his Nintendo debut for us, but Sonic Advance was a whole new game. And even better: It was 2D Sonic fun. Fast forward a year or two later, we get another offering of said 2D Sonic fun.Sonic Advance 2 is a more speed-orientated game compared to its predecessor. Most of the time, you'll be running through levels in an incredible pace. It's like a 2D rollercoaster ride. Nevertheless, it was really satisfying.The level design is HUGE, and is well multilayered. Sonic Advance 1 had multilayered level design as well, but here, it's totally expanded. There are lots of areas to explore if you're not a big fan of this "go to end of the level" thing. In fact, to get to the Special Stages in the game, you gotta find 7 "special rings" scattered in each level. Everyone's gotta love Special Stages, eh? But even without the exploration factor, the levels are still very fun to blast through. I just wish there were a few more enemies in each level.Of course, the graphics were really detailed, colorful, and vibrant all around. Actually...It seems like they IMPROVED on the graphics department. These new zones look all the more better than they did back in Sonic Advance.Speaking of improvements, the soundtrack managed to be catchier, too. And with level themes such as a Techno Base and a Music Plant, it's obvious we'll be expecting some good music out of here.The only major flaw with Sonic Advance 2 is that it does sometimes feel like it's not offering as much platforming gameplay as it should have. It's speed, speed, SPEED. At least there's still some platforming, but not as much as its predecessor.But all in all, Sonic Advance 2 is definitely worth your while, and if you're into this Sonic stuff, then you're in for a good time.

In 1988, when Nintendo was developing Super Mario Bros. 3, someone said "Oh my god! We forgot to make a Mario 2 for North America!"So they made one out of Japan-only game Doki Doki Panic. And everybody liked it...until they found out what was done to make it.Super Mario Bros 2 differed a lot from the first Mario game. Mainly because of its origin. You throw veggies at your enemies, there's a mini-boss at the end of every level, you get to choose from 4 characters, and Bowser isn't the main enemy. And you know what? All that was awesome. The music and sounds were kind of what you expected in a Mario game, but note: Doki Doki Panic had the same music and sounds. Just that this is in 32-Bit.This Game Boy Advance version is a great re-release of Mario 2. It featured lots of improvements over the original. First, notice the score system. Mario 2 never kept track of score, and neither did the Super Nintendo version (in Mario All-Stars). There are also new GIANT Pow Blocks and Shy Guys. Hearts now appear a lot more often. Of course, there are now voices.The biggest difference I know is the new Yoshi Challenge after you beat Wart for the first time. You have to go around all the levels of the game, looking for hidden Yoshi eggs (Don't worry, you can select the levels). Get all 40 and then you beat the whole game. The eggs, though, are hidden in the Subspace (Where you find the mushrooms), and they are not beside the mushrooms. The Yoshi Challenge made the game's replay value go up higher.There's also a version of Mario Bros (the arcade game) included with Super Mario Bros 2. This version is also pretty updated. You can do the Super Jump from SMB2 and you can also pick up and throw Pow Blocks. You can also run, which is a bit helpful. You can also link up to play with 3 friends in co-op.Think that's enough? NOPE! There's also a 4-Player VS mode that uses Mario Bros. This time, you need to either collect 5 coins or be the last one standing to win. There are some cool items you can use, but they are found in a trash can (gross). Stars, hearts, shells, you name it.Overall, it's an awesome cartridge.

After playing terrific Genesis game, Vectorman, you would wonder what the sequel has to offer.Well, the sequel is actually a continuation of the first game. Nonetheless, since it plays like the first game, it is just as great and fun as it.The gameplay is awesome. You get to shoot in all directions, double jump, and get different weapons. Vectorman can also shapeshift when you collect a certain item. In a water level, he swims farther up, which is pretty helpful since he doesn't swim. There are some levels that change the gameplay a bit.The bosses are pretty difficult, but once you get the pattern down, you can defeat them a little easily.The sounds define the action genre. Shooting sounds, explosion sounds, and catchy background music.Overall, this is a really great game Genesis fans should go ahead and buy.

Sonic 3D Blast is a radical departure from the other classic Sonics. It takes gameplay from the Flicky arcade/Genesis game, and throws Sonic action and great fake 3D into the blender!There are so many zones in this game that you probably wouldn't have time to finish the game. The bad part about that is that there's no saving or loading, BUT the closest thing to that is the level select. The level select, while it can be accessed by a button code, can also be accessed by cartridge tilting. It's secretive, yeah, but it's the closet thing to a save feature. That's what makes this version superior over the Saturn game: Easy level select access.The Special Stages, while presented in even better fake 3D, are very easy. You have to cross a huge bridge over lava or the Earth, collecting rings and dodging spike bombs. You can probably finish one with over 300 or 200 rings.The main gameplay is about saving Flickies after you kill the Badniks. Then you must toss 'em into a giant ring that lets you go to the next part of the level.Shields are still present. There's the regular shield, the fire shield, and a golden one that lets you use the Homing Attack, a new addition to Sonic games since Sonic Adventure, in which that game and so on lets you use it as a normal attack.Overall, I could have given this 4 stars if I hadn't known about how cartridge tilting accesses the level select. That really helped calm myself. The Flicky/Sonic style action has made a unique twist on the series.

Sonic 1 was awesome, Sonic 2 was awesomer, and Sonic 3 blew the Genesis over the roof! For the first time, you get to save/load your game from 6 different save files to choose from, also letting you choose your character (You can choose characters in Sonic 2, but that was in the Options menu). Sonic 3 improves upon the previous games' graphics and gameplay, introduced us to different kinds of shields and amazingly detailed zones and characters. The music is good, too. Speaking of which, Micheal Jackson helped compose the music (However, he wasn't credited)!Once again, SEGA helped the blue blur's popularity increase by making another great game.

Mario and Sonic have been competing from 1991 all the way to a decade later. That's when the Sega console thing crumbled. But now who would have thought that Mario and Sonic would be in the same game?The game may be an Olympics video game, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be any fun. The game is packed with lots of events, including running, swimming, Javelin throw, Long jumping, triple jumping, etc. The best events in this game are the Dream events, and for one major reason: It combines Mario and Sonic elements into Olympic sports.Dream Race feels like a fun Mario Kart spin-off. It is complete with obstacles, speed panels, and Mario Kart-y items. Dream Platform takes skydiving to big heights (No pun intended) with the Mario bricks, the items, and the button patterns from the Trampoline event. It makes everything a lot more fun.Another great inclusion is playing with your Miis. While it's pretty cool playing with Mario and Sonic in the same game screen, how about add in a Mii version of, oh I don't know, Pac-Man? Or maybe Shigeru Miyamoto (Creator of Mario)?One thing that I just find to be very moan-inducing are the non-Olympic minigames that unlock Olymics trivia if you beat them. Why are they moan-inducing? Well, there's a Simon-based one where you have to click on the characters that appear onscreen in a pattern that mimmicks the example. What's bad about it is that the sound bites from the characters repeat so often that it's just....I don't know..do you want to hear "Oh, no-Oh, no-Awesome!-Awesome!-Aw, man"? It sounds ridiculous.But overall, this is a great game for the Wii library. Hopefully, we'll see another Mario and Sonic game besides Winter Olympics. One in which they both set on a platforming quest.

Okay....Lemme just simply say this: You CAN'T WIN. On top of that, the rules just don't make too much sense.Why can't I kill anyone, especially since I totally NEED TO?Why am I moving back after turning into Hyde, who happens to be extremely powerful compared to Dr. Jekyll?Why do I die when becoming Hyde?Why am I dying from everybody, anyway? Do they hold some sort of idiotic grudge against me for no particular reason?Why is this game so broken (In-game)?!These are the questions you'd often ask yourself when playing this. But of course, there's no answer to even one of them. Due to these very, very, VERY messy flaws, this is one of the worst games you'd ever play. PLEASE don't buy it, whatever you do.

If you have no idea who the characters are, go to homestarrunner .com QUICKLY! Done it? Well, good.Now, one thing I should point out is that most of the content that can be found on this disc can be found online. But hey, there are some advantages this DVD has that the computer doesn't.1. It's Homestar on your TV!2. Commentary exclusive to DVD3. The bonus contentThe bonus content includes some totally random stuff, including Exaggerations, which are basically bloopers of Homestar toons that were removed from the site.The Homestar flash cartoon show, in general, is full of extremely funny moments, and now that you have it on DVD, you might as well start watching it.

Pac-Man and ET were the two games for the Atari to cause the "end" of videogames. But I don't understand what's wrong with the game. So what if the maze is different? So what if the graphics are different? So what if the sounds are different?At least the gameplay is the same! You guide Pac-Man around, munching off all the dots in the maze.The sounds are beeps and bops. Like how every Atari game has them.There's no music.I mean, seriously. People are making a big deal out of nothing. This game is good the way it is.

With the exception of the beloved Simpsons arcade game and Hit and Run, all the Simpsons games out there are pretty much bad. This DS game, however, captures everything we love about the TV show and puts it into one great cartridge!While the game contains great platforming and cool settings in each level, it also captures the traditional Simpsons comedy while also embarking an entirely new storyline.Despite the fact that the cutscenes are in 3D, while they are 2D in the console versions, they feel very true to the show, and they will keep you laughing. The sound quality is fantastic, too. The story is about the dysfunctional family finding out that they are REALLY IN a video game! Later, however, the aliens try to take over Springfield. In order to fight back, the Simpsons must go into the game engine, and then get the ability to talk to, GASP, God!Want to see what a cutscene is like? Well, here's a sneak peak at what they say when they enter the game engine:Homer: I'm not a video game character. I'm a real life man with dreams and feelings. (Looks down, noticing he's floating over a gap) AAAaahh! (respawns) Okay, I'm a video game guy....You can double jump and beat up enemies in your way. There are also some other moves you can do, like how Homer can turn into a giant ball, and Lisa can pick up things indirectly. Bart wears a Batman-style outfit and can fly, along with latching on certain points with the grappling hook.After getting through Simpsons-themed levels, you'll find DOZENS of hilarious video game parodies. One level, in fact, pokes fun at the Legend of Zelda series. Another is a spoof of Pokemon! In fact again, it even has turn-based battles against the made-up Pokemon-like creatures that are owned by certain kids from Springfield Elementary. Heck, even an old MARIO pops in a cutscene!You can also unlock Frogger and Space Invaders parodies after beating the TreeHouse of Horror level. They are just as addicting as the original arcade games.The 2 to 4 player Vs mode is fun, too. There are 3 different types of gameplay here: Get the Krusty Head (Bart), Golden Donut (Homer, but this plays identical to Krusty Head), and just plain battling.One thing that might seem dull is how there are infinite lives. If you die, you respawn at the start or a checkpoint if you got one, but there's no life counter. I guess Matt G. decided to give us a chance at watching the cutscenes?Overall, this is one heck of a Simpsons game. It's an all new and funny chapter in the Simpsons series. You shouldn't pass this up.

How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess.The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!However, Sonic Adventure is not without flaws. The cutscenes aren't amazing, and while the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother (THAT'S A CHAOS EMERALD! - Says Knuckles as 2 Chaos Emeralds have been spotted). Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, of course, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them.

Don't get me wrong, the Playstation 3 IS a decent console, but most of its games are already on other systems, but with more DLC (So it seems) that you must pay for to get additional content, and the system is already overly expensive (Even now). So why do I prefer this original over PS3? Is it because of its graphics? No. It's because of its game library.The Playstation had a good amount of games that I actually WANTED, and they weren't on other systems, and even if some were, those versions on the other systems would be inferior to what this classic system had to offer. Such examples are Mega Man X4, Pac-Man World, Rayman, Frogger, Spyro (Well, I bought A Spyro game), etc (And maybe the original Crash, too, once I buy that game). If you want, you can go see my reviews for some of those games.The games do not have online play, nor do they have DLC (What do you expect from a 90s console?), but what they DO have will keep you at these games for a very long time. Video games should be about just playing them and trying to beat them for the fun of it, NOT about superior graphics or whatever else gamers easily fall for (I'm looking at you, COD). This original Playstation console proves just that.

Excitebike is a motorcycle racing game for the original NES. It doesn't have a huge track selection (There are only 5 tracks, compared to Mario Kart's 16 or 20), but there are 2 gameplay modes (Race against time or CPUs) and, the best part, a track designer! Yup, that's right. A NES game with a level editor. Pure bizarreness.The graphics are great for the NES, and so are the sounds.The gameplay is pure motorcycle racing adapted to NES controllers. When you crash, you better mash A and B quickly.The frustrating aspect about the game, however, is when you crash nearby a ramp. You don't go back down the ramp. You keep tumbling UP the ramp, and then down the other side. Yet, it's funny watching the riders tumble on the ground.

Pac-Pix is not the average Pac-Man game. Rather than having to control the dot-muncher himself, the goal is to actually save him from ghosts that popped out of a coloring book by drawing up Pac-Men of your own! The result is another arcade-style triumph.The premise is pretty simple. You just have to make your drawn Pac-Men eat up the ghosts in the level to move on. However, like any well-crafted concept, it becomes very addicting. In fact, it even teaches you a few new things that enhance the gameplay rather than detract from it. For example, you would eventually draw walls to guide the Pac-Men, bombs, arrows, etc. It's no Scribblenauts, but it certainly is very fun to do all this.In case if you're still craving for little more, the game has a built-in sketchbook that allows you to freely play around with your newly found gameplay techniques, as well as try to find some hidden ones within (I scribbled, and it created a rain cloud) Overall, Pac-Pix is a must-have for any DS owner.

You know what could be better than a Game Boy? A Super Game Boy. It's a cartridge for your Super Nintendo, but at the same time, it is an installment in the Game Boy line of handhelds. Best to call it a peripheral for the SNES. You may play your Game Boy games on the go, but there's nothing like playing them on your TV with a controller in your hand. However, there's more to go with TV gaming.You can also colorize the palliates in any way you like to see your games look. Heck, you can even Virtual Boy-ulize the experience by coloring it red and black. There are also some pre-made palliates to choose from.The least useful feature of the bunch in the cartridge is the option to change your control type. You can use B as the A button and Y as the B button...or you can just use the A and B buttons themselves like normal. The latter lets you use the Y button as B button still, though.You can choose from borders if the Game Boy game you're playing doesn't have one (I'll tell you about this further in the review). The Game Boy border looks great and all, but how about turning it into a theater? Or maybe a billboard? Or perhaps just plain black?You can also draw your own border! It is kind of a chore to draw one up, but if you are a SNES artist, go right ahead. Within this option, you can draw on the game screen using the rainbow paint. Just imagine playing Super Mario Land, and on the screen, you read "LOL". However, if you leave the Super Game Boy menu, the paint disappears.Even a second player can goof off with you on the Super Game Boy menu! Let your friend draw randomness on the screen for ya! That can actually help make games become harder, if your friend blocks a certain part of the screen.If you find a Game Boy game that has a Super Game Boy symbol on it, that means that if the game is played on the Super Game Boy, it will contain special features that you can't experience on the average Game Boy system. Donkey Kong '94 has its own border, and it also plays 16-Bit music in the credits sequence. Street Fighter II has multiple borders and a 2-Player mode. The best use for the Super Game Boy is how Space Invaders can let you access the Super Nintendo version of the game (No 2-Player mode, though) from a menu when booting it up.Some black Game Boy (Color) cartridges (Ones that are advertised as Game Boy Color games) would happen to have their own borders too, as well as some color features. Mortal Kombat 4, for example, has a border showing the game's logo, and the color palliates would differ every battle. It doesn't work with actual Game Boy Color games, though.....sadly.Overall, this peripheral is just plain amazing. Totally worth it.

It's the mid-90s. Nintendo and Sega were competing head-to-head against each other by battling using their main game consoles and games, including the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. Nintendo tried to use the Virtual Boy to help, but that failed. They were even competing with the handheld section of the industry with the Game Boy and the Game Gear! As the wait for the 64-bit era was coming very close, game companies now wanted to enhance their graphics by pre-rendering them. Sega's entry rivaled Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country. It doesn't look like it, but that entry is Vectorman.Vectorman is nothing like Donkey Kong Country at all, but the two things they have in common are their superior graphics and their late release dates.The gameplay is awesome. You get to shoot in all directions, double jump, and get different weapons. Vectorman can also shapeshift when you collect a certain item. In a water level, he swims farther up, which is pretty helpful since he doesn't swim. There are some levels that change the gameplay a bit. The second level, for example, is an on-rails boss battle that shows off more fancy-looking fake-3D graphics.The bosses are pretty difficult, but once you get the pattern down, you can defeat them. After you defeat them, Vectorman does this pose where he kinda copies Mario with the peace sign, but he uses both his hands this time. He also acts like this kinda "WHOO! That was awesome!" kinda thing.The sounds define the action genre. Shooting sounds, explosion sounds, and catchy background music.Overall, this is a really great game that is a must-have for Genesis fans.

The DOS has had a pretty long lifetime. Even after succeeded by computers like the Windows 95, the ol' PC still lives on, as it contains memorable classics from years up to as far as the early 2000s, but the question is: Are the games in this collection some of those classics? Well, let's discuss about those games right now.Before I actually start though, I can say this: In order to run your DOS games, disks or files themselves, on newer computers, you must use the DosBox emulator. In order to run a Windows 95 disk like this, though, that may be a different story.===============STREET FIGHTER GAMES================One thing I can say for sure is that Street Fighters 1 & 2 are pretty faithful to the original arcade versions, considering the limits of the DOS. Heck, they even manage to have the same colorfully cool graphics, but the music and sound effects aren't on-par. I recall a single song (If not similar sounding music) playing throughout the game with minimal sfx. Fortunately, they still play like how you expect them to: Identical to the arcade games' gameplay. Though the controls may be confusing at first (Heck, I even forgot what buttons you use just now), and the loading times are somewhat of a bummer (I mean, how long must you wait for a fight to begin in the game?), but overall, if you like arcade fighting games, including the likes of this series and Mortal Kombat, they might be worth a look.===============MEGA MAN============================Here, Mega Mans 1 & 3 will be separate sections, since there's much more to talk about.You know that cool NES game of the same name, in which you take on various robot masters and steal their powers? Well, this game has the concept, but that's all that relates to the original. YUP! This is a totally different Mega Man game, with 3 original robot masters (Sonic Man, Dyna Man, and Volt Man) and pretty much anything you never expected to be in a Mega Man game.The controls are actually simple, but awkward. You press J to jump and spacebar to shoot. Personally, I would use Joy-to-Key so I can use a USB controller. Strangely, unlike the Street Fighter games, Mega Man failed to capture the graphical quality of the NES games. The sound effects are classic. They sound like classic Atari sound effects. Speaking of which, there's no music, but this is excusable, since DOS platformers for its time had that same issue.The gameplay, though still identical to the NES games, went on to be unique in interesting ways. It's stunning to see Mega Man fight frogs, bats, spiders, seals, birds, bees, etc. The level design is also pretty cool, but also frustrating in certain ways. Near the end of Dyna Man's stage, there's a row of pathways of spiders. Since you can't shoot downwards, you are forced to walk through, taking damage. Another crappy piece of design was how in the second area of Volt Man's stage, there are machines that suck you towards the harmful electricity. You NEED to jump through when the electricity is off.Despite the frustrations, this game is still easier than the average Mega Man game. Even the Dr. Wily stage won't be a major problem. Instead of a teleport system, the robot masters are re-fought right as you enter through a gate. Since there are only 3 robot masters as opposed to 6 in the NES game, you can find out what their weaknesses are easily, although using the normal power can still be pretty effective, since they don't flash and you can shoot them without hesitating. The final boss isn't that great. Dr. Wily's machine just moves back and forth, chasing you. It is as sensitive to your bullets as the robot masters.The ending isn't special, either. It's just a single screen combined with credits. Who would've known that only ONE GUY made the whole game? He's credited for everything but the Mega Man concept (Obviously Capcom's doing). Forgot who it was.....Overall, Mega Man DOS isn't as amazing as the NES and Game Boy Mega Man games, but it sure is a good game for Mega Man fans.===============MEGA MAN 3==================Mega Man 3 is more or less like the first game (Same controls, gameplay, graphics, etc), except much more annoying. The level design is actually more of some kind of maze. Each level has multiple paths, and chances are you'd be lost in the middle of the level.The enemies are actually tougher than the first game's, too. The ones that were in the previous installment happen to take more hits. The new enemies also take more hits, as well as being weirder (Live plants? Seriously?). If there is an obstacle at a small platform, though, you know you must make caarrreeful jumps.The game also features 6 robot masters, but no password feature. This wasn't a problem in the first game, since that was short, but fun. HERE, since the levels are not that easy to navigate, and you could possibly die tons of times, having to continue or choose another stage, it would have been a life saver to be able to save!Lastly, the most minor complaint: The robot master icons. Okay, so the icons depict the robot masters as color/suit rip-offs of other robot masters from the NES games (Blade Man -- purple Metal Man) (Bit Man -- yellow Hard Man) (Oil Man -- red Flash Man) (Wave Man -- Air Man! They didn't even change the look!). But guess what? They don't look like these rips in-game (Except Wave Man)! Since when was a robot master icon so misleading? Since this game, that's what.Overall, this game is ONLY for die-hard Mega Man fans. Others can look elsewhere.

I was actually trying to go and get this earlier, but I used up my Amazon money for other games and stuff. And now that it's 3DS e-Shop re-release is available on Club Nintendo for only 100 coins (If you don't know about Club Nintendo, I suggest you join and see what it's about. It's a great service), I was able to go and nab this classic at ease.So, Kirby is known as a pink blob that sucks things up and copies enemy abilities, right? Well, here, since it IS the first Kirby game, you don't get to obtain enemy powers whatsoever. You'll be happy to know, however, that it doesn't affect the platforming experience badly at all. In fact, Kirby's Dream Land as a whole is spectacular.The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen on a Game Boy game, and the music is very upbeat and fun to listen to. To top it all off, the gameplay is thrilling. It's unlike what you've dealt with in other Nintendo classics like Mario. Not only do you run and jump, but you can eat enemies, and spit them out at others! Oh, and you can fly! There are also some cool gimmicks, like shooting fire after collecting SuperSpicey Curry for a short period of time, and being able to fly and shoot out puff clouds during one of the bosses, in a similar fashion to shooters like Gradius.The only issue with this game is that it is pretty short. There are only 5 levels, with the 5th level being composed of bosses that you've previously fought, as well as King Dedede, the final boss. But just because a game is short doesn't mean it's bad. And this game is excellent.Unlike Kirby 64 and Kirby's Dream Land 3, this game is not totally easy, as there's surprisingly a bit of challenge here. Plus, the music sounds best here.Anyways, if you happen to own a Game Boy, a GB Color, or a GB Advance, this is definitely one game to play. Heck, you should buy it on the e-Shop for your Nintendo 3DS (If you own one), or go to Club Nintendo and get this without using actual money (Though this offer will last until the 31st)!

When it comes to talking about Pac-Man for the Game Boy, there's nothing I can actually say that isn't already said by other reviewers. It's classic arcade Pac-Man on the go, wherever you are. It's certainly not a bad deal at all.One problem, however, is...well....There's another release of this version of the game for the Game Boy, but with an added game: Super Nintendo puzzle game Pac-Attack. Not only that, but that release also has both games played in full color when playing it on a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance.http://www.amazon.com/Pac-Man-Special-Color-Game-Boy/dp/B00000K1XF/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_tSo I can't really say I wholly recommend this one, considering there's that other release for the same system.

Okay, I'll be honest: I'm not that good at NBA Jam. Yet, I have a lot of fun playing it.It has really cool 8-Bit tunes that play during the game.The game plays just like the arcade game, but portable and 8-Bit....obviously. It's arcade basketball at its finest.The graphics are pretty good for its time. I also like the blur for the ball when the player throws it straight into the hoop.Why I stink at NBA Jam: For some reason, when I try blocking, the opponent would end up going around me and scoring. Yet, I go neck-to-neck with the opponent.The game is really fun to play and if you like the arcade game, it's totally worth buying.

MegaMan has it all: Precise controls, catchy tunes, amazing graphics, and incredible gameplay. That has been spread across the 10 games in the classic console series, and the 5 games in the classic handheld series. So what is the deal with MegaMan II for the Game Boy?Well, it's supposed to be a version of MegaMan 2 for the NES. As the game starts, there are only 4 robot masters to encounter (Wood Man, Air Man, Crash Man, and Metal Man). This is because of cartridge limits, but when you play the first game on Game Boy and get to the Dr. Wily Teleport System, that part actually has you fight the other 4 robot masters from MegaMan 2. So what's in this game's Teleport System? Well, since this part is at the near-end of the game, I'll tell you further in this review.Anyways, the game is just as fun as all the other MegaMan games. The controls are still precise, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is spot-on. While it is supposed to be a version of MegaMan 2, however, the level layouts are different, and the music is nothing similar to the original (In fact, it's rather poor compared to the other games, but still somewhat catchy....). Nevertheless, the game gives you that sweet and familiar MegaMan 2 feel as you play through the respective robot masters' stages.....until you get to Dr. Wily's castle.Once you reach Dr. Wily's castle, that mad scientist throws MegaMan into a trap. That trap is the Teleport System. There are 4 teleports, right? Well, that means that there are 4 more robot masters (taken from MegaMan 3) that you must fight. However, in the first game, you just fight them. In this game, you actually have to play through their stages! So, I think it's safe to say you're no longer playing MegaMan 2. You're playing a fraction of MegaMan 3!After defeating those robots, you then play through Dr. Wily's stage. Challenging? Well, it may take trial and error for a part or two, but let's hope you still have Energy Tanks. The final boss will require you to use some as your health bar may deplete during the battle.Overall, this is a great game that I recommend any MegaMan to purchase. Plus, the difficulty is more fair here than in other MegaMan games, so new MegaMan players should start here. Buy this game for your Game Boy, Color, or even Advance!

This is the third (Or is it the last?) version of the Toy Story movie-based game. While the other versions were good games, this one couldn't live up to them.Only 10 of the 17 (18 for Sega Genesis version) levels are in this game. There are no bosses at all. Just laggy platforming.About the gameplay, which I sorta described already, there was one major problem that ruined it: The frame rate. Everything moves too slow. The frame rate is like half of the frame rate in the other versions of the game.The graphics are still pretty good, but it is eclipsed by the slow gameplay.The sounds sound like Atari noises. The music sounds good, but there are only 3 songs in the whole game.There are some cool features when the game is played on the Super Game Boy:-Special border-16-bit musicOverall, the frame rate is what's basically keeping the game from having me rate any higher. The frame rate isn't actually slow slow, but I wish it was better. Plus, this is the only 8-bit version of Toy Story, as well as the only portable one (With the exception of playing the SNES version on a FC 16 Go).

In Back to the Future 3 (otherwise known as PART 3 or III), you play as the Doc riding on a horse. I assume it's the Wild West or something like that. You must dodge everything in your path and behind your path. If that doesn't sound hard, then I'll tell you how hard the game would be.IT IS A VIDEO GAME VERSION OF COMPLETE INSANITY AND FRUSTRATION!!!!There would always be something that you won't know would be in your path. For example, who would have expected a gunman shooting at you behind your horse? Or how about those flying objects and upcoming cliffs?It would be pure luck to memorize everything that happens. Too bad everybody will never have that kind of luck playing this game.If you get a Game Over (Trust me. You will always see this screen), you will see a still image of Clara falling to her death and then you will see her tombstone. That is just mocking us. You would know that the tombstone represents a death of a loved one, but here, it represents the fact that you will never be able to get past the first level. It seriously just teases you.Overall, STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM THIS GAME. IT IS ANGER IN A VIDEO GAME AS ITS FINEST!!!!!

Gain Ground is no doubt an arcade game. Everything, from the stats to the game screen tells you it is.The goal is to kill all the enemies scattered in the level by shooting at them. The game also contains real-time strategy elements, so beware of the arrows aimed at you.So...yeah. All you do is move around and shoot.There isn't really anything much to say about this game, but it's really addicting and I think you should buy it if you're a die-hard arcade fan.

Yeah, there's basically no other way to put it. Kid Chameleon is a Super Mario clone. From bashing blocks to jumping on enemies, this game has "Mario" written all over it. That's not to say the game is bad, though.It emulates the Mario series greatly, and that can only be a good thing. There are also some very cool power-ups that are exclusive to this game, such as turning into a ninja, complete with sword. The levels also have really interesting designs.While there isn't really anything else to say about this game, if you love Mario games, you should get this, considering there isn't an official Mario game ever released for the Genesis.

If you loved the movie, you would probably love the game..well, at least this version of the game.There are two gameplay modes: Beginner and Expert. The Beginner's mode lasts 20 minutes. The burglars' plumbers truck moves a bit slow. The Wet Bandits go to houses in a certain pattern The items you collect in the houses would automatically be formed together to make weapons you can use to injure the Wet Bandits. In Expert mode, the game lasts 40 minutes, the truck moves faster, the burglars have no pattern to follow, and you form the weapons yourself.Don't know what I'm talking about? Here, read below.As Kevin, you start outside one of the houses with your sled. You must follow the Wet Bandits as they go to a house. Before they enter one, however, you must go inside first to set up the traps. After you're done, you really go in the house. It plays like a platform game when you're inside a house. So you go around, get some items, and then the Wet Bandits come. If you're not in the same house as them, you better chase them before they flood the house. There are 5 houses. My favorite is the Ultra-Modern House, where it has a futuristic theme. The houses would probably have their own traps (Spiders, robots, etc). So you must give the Wet Bandits enough pain to fill up the Pain meter so they can get out of the house.Now all that action is what makes the game awesome. You form weapons and set traps in a platformer in which you must hurt the burglars to kick them out!The music and sounds are as good as any great 16-bit game.The graphics are also very neat and they fit in with the game greatly.Overall, SEGA represented Home Alone in the best way possible in a video game.

Space Harrier II is a Genesis-only sequel to the original arcade, Master System, and Game Gear game.Unlike the original, this is a non-linear game, which means you get to go to any level you want.The main gameplay is what you would expect from the Space Harrier series: Pure fake 3D shooting.Now for the downsides. The music isn't as well-tuned as the original game's themes. The difficulty of the game can be pretty cheap at times, too.Overall, it's a good game that lives up to the Space Harrier name a bit nicely.

If you liked Sonic 3, you're in luck. Sonic and Knuckles has about 65% of Sonic elements (-25% levels, -4% Tails, -6% Save Files)What's even better is that the cartridge contains lock-on technology!What is it exactly? You plop Sonic 2 on top to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2! Plop Sonic 3 on to combine the two games together! Sonic 1 on top unlocks Blue Sphere, a game made out of Sonic 3 Special Stages.So yeah. Sonic and Knuckles is the second part of Sonic 3, and it is just as good.

T2: The Arcade Game was based off of the Terminator 2 movie. In the arcades, it was played with video game guns. The home ports for the Super Nintendo and the Genesis are compatible with the Super Scope and the Sega Menacer game guns. However, you may also use the controllers, but the result of that is moving a cursor around shooting things. It isn't a bad way to play, though.The game tries to follow the movie's storyline by telling it in between certain levels. After waiting for the first part of the story to end, you will end up shooting everything in sight! There are robots coming from both sides of the screen, and enemy planes flying in the sky. Kill them all!! That sums up the whole game pretty much, but the awesome action would obviously keep you playing.One downside I must point out is that the level where you have to protect John Konner is too difficult. There are several robots and planes attacking the pickup truck. However, there is a way I know to beat this level: Only bomb the planes. Don't concentrate on the robots. And bomb them RIGHT AWAY! Having another player help out would be nice, I guess.Thankfully, there's a 2-Player mode that adds to the game's replay value. As both of you Terminators get your controllers prepared, you'll be ready for the greatness of shooting mindlessly.

How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess. And now that there's a DX version, it's on several other systems, including Gamecube, Xbox, PC, PS3, etc, so everyone gets an opportunity to see this classic.The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!However, Sonic Adventure DX is not without flaws. There are a few times where the collision gets a little awry, and the cutscenes aren't amazing, too. While the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother. Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, again, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them. Oh yeah, and the unlockable collection of Game Gear games is a great bonus!

Mickey Mania was one of the last games Sony had created before the company went on to make the Playstation.The first level takes you to the iconic Steamboat Willie cartoon. However, if you think that the first level is supposed to be simple, think again. There are numerous obstacles that are most likely to hurt you. If you get hit, you are only invincible for half a second. What makes the gameplay become fun is when you start collecting these spheres and then later throw them at enemies. You soon encounter ol' timey Pete, but he actually isn't the boss. Hit him 4 times and use him as a spring to bounce over a pile of crates. The REAL first boss is the machinery. You must destroy 4 gears by hitting them 5 times (3 times for the top ones) The boss, at first, plays incredibly hard, since the crates drop bombs on you. However, you don't find out til later to figure out that you can just jump to avoid getting blown up. After the boss, Mickey appears with Steamboat Willie. Then the text says "Congratulations! Mickey has rescued Steamboat Willie!" What? He was kidnapped?The second level is, one of my favorites, The Mad Doctor. Right when you encounter a skeleton, things get hard. When the skeletons get destroyed, their bones fly up and fall down, but you actually had to avoid colliding with them. There are several portions of this level. After the first part, the second part contains rope swinging over lava. The third has you ride a runaway mine cart, but you must jump over the incoming spike balls. If things can't get any harder for you, you're lucky to know that the fourth portion lets you take a break as you run through a spiral staircase killing bats and jumping over barrels (Donkey Kong inspiration). It's easier than the previous parts...and it looks better than them, too, as that part is presented in fake 3D. There's also this part where you must perform chemistry. The downside here is that if you push it to the stool without the 3 layers you have to put in, the only decision is to kill yourself. The Mad Doctor doesn't seem like a very hard boss until you attack. If hit, he throws full flasks all over the place.The third level is Moose Hunters. If you don't follow Pluto on this one, you're dead. Countless tree branches and boulders would fall on you. Moose would also gallop towards you at certain times. After beating the first part, things get easier, yet awkward. You now have to run away from a moose in a beautifully stupid fake 3D level.The Lonesome Ghosts is your fourth level. Going up certain staircases would make them turn into a ramp. There are tilting platforms that you must tilt in the right direction to go on. The second part is annoying. You have to balance on a barrel while the house is being flooded. As you make your way towards left, the third barrel would sink, but if you get closer to the left, the water stops. That's the annoying part: The water. If you jump in, you lose your life automatically basically.Mickey and the Beanstalk is graphically colorful. There's not a lot of hard stuff in here. Although I must admit the dragonflies are annoying. When you get to the first huge enemy, you'd think it'd be a boss since boss music is playing, but no. You must hop on a ladybug. The ladybug speeds away from the "boss" extremely. Once you reach the giant's house, there's a plate with Jello on it. You have to push it towards the wall, but you probably won't know it at first, since it's a big object to push.Now...the Prince and the Pauper....it's the hardest and final level of the game. You swing, you kill, all that stuff. Unfortunately, I can't explain anymore since you must find about this on your own. Good luck.Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of platform games, Mickey Mouse, or you just want a major challenge, go ahead and buy this game.

It was the year 1996. The Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn were making its way, whereas the Playstation is already snatching up some customers. The Super Nintendo's and the Genesis's appeals were coming to an end, as people were now concentrating on the newer systems. And now, Sega ends its line of first-party games for the Genesis with...Virtua Fighter 2? And not as a Sega 32x game? I don't know about their decisions, either, but Virtua Fighter 2 is one of those games that appear on both a new and old system (It's also for the Saturn).The series is supposed to be 3D, with the exception of this game, which is..of course, 2D. That isn't a bad thing, though. After all, we all have loved the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat series, right? Well, I wouldn't say the result is bad. The only real problem I have with it is that it is too short (It is made up of 8 stages and a bonus stage at the end). And that is a minor complaint.The 2D fighting is actually pretty responsive and fast. Granted, you can't walk fast, but by fast, I mean the time limit is only 30 seconds (Good if you have more HP than the opponent), and the attacks can drain a fighter's health as much as, well, any other move in a fighting game (See Mortal Kombat uppercuts, punches, and kicks). You can also knock your opponent out of the ring, which automatically earns you a KO. It's pretty satisfying stuff.Even though you may already have a great fighting game, this game is still one to enjoy.

Right before the Super Nintendo came into the scene, Sega was taking care of business pretty easily by releasing the Sega Genesis. Granted, the Master System was out before it, but that didn't become a big shot console.The Genesis had a library of amazingly graphical 16-bit games before the Super Nintendo. In fact, when the Super Nintendo came out, the Genesis library was still growing. Genesis production stopped in 1995, though. Yet, the last game for it came out in 2002.The most notable Genesis titles are the Sonic games and perhaps Gunstar Heroes.

Rayman was big back in 90s. In the late 90s, he got even bigger with Rayman 2. So what was Ubisoft's next move with their popular mascot? The answer: To make an animated series. From the start, you will notice that it has totally different characters and the whole thing takes place in a different world. There's no Globox, no Ly, or Razorbeard. Well, actually, Razorbeard does appear in one of these episodes, but he turns out to be a henchman.This new setting was most likely to be the reason why the show only got 4 episodes released, but are they bad? Well, I already pointed out that there's no relation to the Rayman series other than Rayman himself. However, that's not to big of a bad thing. For major Rayman fans, this can be a bad letdown, but others won't find this to be any harm. The show is actually as comedic as that of an average Cartoon Network or Nick cartoon. Well, ones that are supposed to be funny.I think it's also better than some other video game based shows out there. If you were to compare it to, say, the Super Mario Bros Super Show (which is also a fine cartoon), you'll notice that the jokes are better here. I don't really enjoy listening to the pasta jokes in the SMB Super Show. If comparing to Sonic X, the characters were more annoying in that show (I'm talking to you, Chris Thorndyke). This may be going a little off-topic, considering I'm rambling on about other shows, but what I'm saying is: This show is a game-based show that's actually more fun to watch than the rest.

Pac-Man World showed that while people are now looking out for games with guns, explosions, and those other kind of things, there can still be a good game that doesn't need any of that. The sequel has shown the same thing.PMW2 plays a bit like the first game, but with several improvements. For instance, there's a fair difficulty now, and the camera angles are like how it usually would be in an average 3D game.The gameplay is really fun. You have what you had in the first PMW: Rev Roll in a Sonic-like way, Butt Bouncing, and hey, look! Now there's a mid-air flip kick! Pretty useful at times. Like the first game, the gameplay is about eating fruits, dots, and unlocking special mazes. Sometimes, the gameplay can vary when it comes to a certain level where it has to. Like in Blade Mountain, you have to skate through caves and jump up ramps (Like how it's shown on the boxart). In the water levels (except one), it's an on-rails shooter in which you shoot the enemies trying to attack.The mazes hidden in the game are as fun as the original Pac-Man arcade games. Although some are slight redesigns of old Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man mazes, new ones are also in the mix. You can also collect Namco tokens (which are also hidden) to be able to unlock the actual arcade games. If you go to Sue's Arcade in the Pac-Village, you can play the arcade games anytime you want after unlocking them. The games are: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, and Pac-Attack (The only console re-release not counting Virtual Console). You can also play the unlocked mazes there, too.The sound effects are just classic and action-y. The music is also really cool to listen to. B-Doing Woods has a really lively tune to it, and the water stages have a pretty dramatic theme in each.The graphics aren't exactly the best the Playstation 2 has to offer, but they still look really good and the arcade games are replicated on-screen pixel by pixel.Overall, if you enjoyed the first Pac-Man World, you would NEED to play this one. Better yet, if you haven't played the first one, this is a great place to start, considering how it's released on multiple systems other than Sony's line of Playstation consoles.

This movie is why I'm an Animaniacs fan. Actually, I wasn't a fan for a long time, but it came to me when I decided to rewatch this movie (I've seen it when I was really young...On Cartoon Network), which led to me watching the show itself. Heck, I even bought the licensed video game! But my fandom aside, Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish is a timeless animated classic.It's nice to see most of the characters play all-new roles in this movie, yet still keep their original personalities (EX: Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff dries to make a successful drink, and the Warners are orphans). However, since the movie takes place in a town whose wealth was squeezed up dry by Plotz, there's a more serious plot, and it's taken even further with a villainous king who wants the Warners to die off. Does that mean the series's off-the-wall humor is destroyed?Actually, no! The Warner Bros (And of course the Warner Sister) still make more incredibly witty jokes (And perhaps some old ones snuck in, too?), and the fact that Pinky and the Brain make their appearances in this movie creates an even better mood for the average Animaniacs fan. Those two brought their own humor to the movie, as well (NARF!).The music that the characters sing add to the feel of the movie, and they are filled with wonderful and catchy tunes. Even if one song were to last a little longer than expected, you can't help but be appealed to the lighthearted tone of the songs.There aren't a lot of cartoon shows out there today that are even worth watching for the very least, but Animaniacs left a powerful impression upon me. The movie is no different from the show when it comes to bringing such greatness. When combining all that I've talked about together, it creates a feel for me that is unmatched by anything else. This is perhaps the best direct-to-video movie you could ever buy. It's totally worth watching.

Mr. Driller...Just when you think you can't do anything more with colorful blocks, this game comes in and combines Dig Dug gameplay with puzzlers. Of course, this game is too awesome to be just in arcades, so it went to Playstation, Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color.This sequel is pretty much more of the same. You get a few more options this time around. There's Easy (2500 ft), Normal (5000 ft), and now a Hard mode that extends to 10000 ft. Oh, and there's Endless mode and a Versus mode.The gameplay is pretty straightforward, yet very addicting. Basically, you just have to drill down the colorful blocks. Of course, you'd have to look out for any blocks that may possibly fall on you? Is that all? Nope. You also have to keep track of the amount of Air you have, so you'll constantly have to fill it up a bit by finding capsules. Seems like this whole paragraph may be a little much to describe the game, but once you jump into it, you'll see how simple and fun it can all be.Since this is on Game Boy Advance, the graphics are exactly like the arcade version of the game: Crisp 2D visuals that appeal to the eye. The soundtrack, unlike Mr. Driller for Game Boy Color, is much better and catchier.Overall, definitely pick this one up if you're a puzzle fan. It will surely last for a long, long time.

Contra. If you can think of an old-school shooting game, this would probably stand right on top of your head. Originally hailing from arcades, the leap to NES made the game even more popular. Better yet...has anyone even played the arcade original?Contra is composed of platform shooting at its finest, hard difficulty, and eight totally fantastic stages! Most of the stages would have a boss at the end, while stages 2 and 4 go into a fake-3D perspective.Like I said the game is hard. What does that mean? Well, it's HARD. There would be so many frustrating deaths caused by numerous enemies. The deaths are also caused by the fact that you can only get hit once. Several games I reviewed had points docked off for this, but here...I'm just having too much of a blast!The graphics are amazing for its time, and the music will always be beating in your 8-Bit heart.What's really awesome about the game is how you get to play co-op with another player! Bill and Lance, kicking robo-butt like anything else in a video game.

Mr. Driller...Just when you think you can't do anything more with colorful blocks, this game comes in and combines Dig Dug gameplay with puzzlers. Of course, this game is too awesome to be just in arcades, so it went to Playstation, Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color.There are 3 different game modes: An Easy mode, having you dig down to 2500 feet. The Hard mode pits you against 5000 ft. Lastly, there's the Survival Mode, with is an endless mode, seeing how many ft you can venture through.The gameplay is pretty straightforward, yet very addicting. Basically, you just have to drill down the colorful blocks. Of course, you'd have to look out for any blocks that may possibly fall on you? Is that all? Nope. You also have to keep track of the amount of Air you have, so you'll constantly have to fill it up a bit by finding capsules. Seems like this whole paragraph may be a little much to describe the game, but once you jump into it, you'll see how simple and fun it can all be.The graphics are amazing. They are some of the best non-pre-rendered visuals I've seen on the Game Boy Color. The music on the other hand....Is why this is rated 4 stars instead of 5. You see, the music is just bland. It doesn't help when you have to listen to a few of these tracks as you play through the game. I guess the music's like this on the Game Boy Color and not arcade/Playstation but JEEZ. Otherwise, definitely pick this one up.

Mario's Fundamentals was originally released as Mario's Game Gallery, which was published by a different company, which is Interplay. However, Nintendo published Fundamentals, making that the only purchasable Nintendo game that is ever released for computers.So what is the game like? Well, you have a selection of four board/card games: Go Fish, Dominoes, Checkers, and Backgammon.While each game isn't themed with Mario elements on the board, the pieces/cards do have Mario characters or items shown on them. Plus, you play against Mario himself, who, most of the time, would just say random things during most turns.If you know how to play at least one of these games, you might as well buy this.It isn't a bad game, but it only features these games. If you were expecting unlockables, you won't find any here.

This is it: The actual arcade machine that contains the original Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga. Okay, so the machine was made in 2001, but it still held the true originals.Ms. Pac-Man is that really popular maze game in which you play as the miss in action. Run around eating all the dots, avoiding the ghosts, you know the drill!Since this is the cabinet that is pretty much everywhere I've been to, chances are that the machine lets you play as a Ms. Pac-Man that runs as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog! If not, then there should probably be a way how you can change that inside the machine itself.Galaga is like Space Invaders, but with several improvements. The enemies do stunts in space while moving down towards you, the "boss" aliens can steal your ship, there are bonus levels, and you can even steal your ship BACK, allowing you to shoot DOUBLE the amount of firepower!Overall, if you are an arcade owner, or just some person who wants an arcade machine in your room, this is for you.

You know what's pathetic? People my age (15 or so) have been suckered into games like Call of Duty. No one in my school even pays attention to Mario, Pac-Man, Sonic, or Halo (And that's in the same genre!). But if you are one to find the good in classics like I did, then prepare yourself for the Atari 2600, the game system that pretty much started it all (Yes, there's the Odyssey, but let's not count that)!The Atari was a system that had video games with really primitive graphics. The sound effects were your average beeps and bloops, and there's often no music (Not the case with Pitfall 2, though). Most of the games had a pretty simple objective: To get the highest score possible. To go with that theme, there are also lots of arcade ports, such as Pac-Man, Mario Bros, Frogger, Asteroids, Pole Position, Dig Dug, etc. And wouldn't you know it: The system and games were successful, critically and commercially (Well, most of them).But this reproduction, while it does contain lots of games (40 games!), just isn't up to the original's standards. You see, the main problem here is the lack of a cartridge slot. Sure, like I said, there's a lot of built-in games, including Pong, Pitfall, Asteroids, and there are even some homebrew (Made after the Atari's discontinuation) titles. Once you get down to it, though, this is all you'll be getting.The lack of a cartridge slot makes this thing seem like the average Atari collection. You can find more Atari collections on PC, Nintendo DS, Playstation, and so on, and one particular collection series, Atari's Greatest Hits, features 50 games in one DS cartridge. And there are two volumes of it, each containing that amount.But even if you don't buy the collections, the games themselves cost a bit under $5 each most of the time. So if you pick up an Atari, be sure to go find some good Atari games out there. I bet your $20 could find you a pretty good amount of video games that would be very worth playing. Some games I recommend are Pitfalls 1 & 2, the 80s arcade ports, and Spider-Man.Overall, get this only if you (A) want to experience the 40 games built-in, or (B) don't have any system that has an Atari collection released for it. Otherwise, just get the real Atari 2600 or buy the other game collections.

Mario's Time Machine wasn't a really perfect game on the NES, but it provided us with classic Mario gameplay in a twist in which it tries to help teach us about history. It has dumb moments, but it's at least decent. The Super Nintendo version, on the other hand, strips away the classic Mario gameplay aspect.Instead of having to fight Koopas in a Mario Bros stage, you pick an artifact (that you must return to the time period) right away. But as the time machine comes down, you don't choose a time period like in the NES version. Instead, you ENTER THE DIGITS YOURSELF, with BC and AD required. What were they thinking??After you choose your period, you go surfing, which had to replace the Koopa scene. The surfing thing is even less winnable or playable than the Koopa scene, though. You have to collect mushrooms and dodge urchins, right? Sounds simple, doesn't it? Well, no. You can almost rarely tell the difference between the two.After that, you finally reach your destination. So do you go around kicking off Koopas and returning the artifact? Nope. Instead, you have to go talk to people and fill out blanks in sentences. You actually HAVE to be taught this stuff to know which word goes in the right blanks. It is annoying.Why should there be a Mario game with FILLING OUT BLANKS and TALKING TO PEOPLE FROM THE PAST? Why not feature the Koopa bashing that Mario was known for in his sidescrollers?Overall, this game is only for people whose brains are meant to know only history. For those who want an educational game with traditional Mario action, go play the NES version.

StarFox is a classic for the Super Nintendo that uses the system's first Super FX chip, a modification of game graphics, making things look 3D.You can choose a few paths, each with different levels to go through.The gameplay is pure (fake) 3D shooting at probably its finest. You can see all kinds of wacky machines shooting at you and/or passing by. You also have 3 teammates to "help" you. Slippy is annoying, though, as a bad guy would always chase him and you would have to rescue him from being attacked.There's always a boss at the end of every level. Everything, even before the bosses, is just plain epic.The graphics, music, and gameplay, are all just awesome.The game may have around just 5 levels in one path, but its one of the few games to show even the smallest game can succeed.

Mortal Kombat was a great fighter in the arcades, but when the sequel came out, the series already blew over the roof!The digitized graphics were better, the gameplay was better, and they even put in more amusing sound effects. In fact, remember the "TOASTY!" guy? That is random and cool at the same time.The gameplay is one-on-one fighting at perhaps its finest. You choose from a wide selection of characters, and then you duke it out with one of them. Fighting moves include punching, kicking, uppercutting, and using a special move. It is incredibly fun and it would always keep you playing.The music is really well-done and neatly composed. Sadly, you'd be concentrating on the fighting, and given how the sound effects are being heard as you smack the opponent to a pulp, it's like as if you'd forget there's music. That happens in almost every fighting game you can imagine existed.Overall, this game is awesome. It will never die out.

Mickey Mania was one of the last games Sony had created before the company went on to make the Playstation. The music and sounds have a higher quality than the Genesis version, but there are loading times in between levels.The first level takes you to the iconic Steamboat Willie cartoon. However, if you think that the first level is supposed to be simple, think again. There are numerous obstacles that are most likely to hurt you. If you get hit, you are only invincible for half a second. What makes the gameplay become fun is when you start collecting these spheres and then later throw them at enemies. You soon encounter ol' timey Pete, but he actually isn't the boss. Hit him 4 times and use him as a spring to bounce over a pile of crates. The REAL first boss is the machinery. You must destroy 4 gears by hitting them 5 times (3 times for the top ones) The boss, at first, plays incredibly hard, since the crates drop bombs on you. However, you don't find out til later to figure out that you can just jump to avoid getting blown up. After the boss, Mickey appears with Steamboat Willie. Then the text says "Congratulations! Mickey has rescued Steamboat Willie!" What? He was kidnapped?The second level is, one of my favorites, The Mad Doctor. Right when you encounter a skeleton, things get hard. When the skeletons get destroyed, their bones fly up and fall down, but you actually had to avoid colliding with them. There are several portions of this level. After the first part, the second part contains rope swinging over lava. The third has you ride a runaway mine cart, but you must jump over the incoming spike balls. There's also this part where you must perform chemistry. The downside here is that if you push it to the stool without the 3 layers you have to put in, the only decision is to kill yourself. The Mad Doctor doesn't seem like a very hard boss until you attack. If hit, he throws full flasks all over the place.The third level is Moose Hunters. If you don't follow Pluto on this one, you're dead. Countless tree branches and boulders would fall on you. Moose would also gallop towards you at certain times. After beating the first part, things get easier, yet awkward. You now have to run away from a moose in a beautifully stupid fake 3D level.The Lonesome Ghosts is your fourth level. Going up certain staircases would make them turn into a ramp. There are tilting platforms that you must tilt in the right direction to go on. The second part is annoying. You have to balance on a barrel while the house is being flooded. As you make your way towards left, the third barrel would sink, but if you get closer to the left, the water stops. That's the annoying part: The water. If you jump in, you lose your life automatically basically.Mickey and the Beanstalk is graphically colorful. There's not a lot of hard stuff in here. Although I must admit the dragonflies are annoying. When you get to the first huge enemy, you'd think it'd be a boss since boss music is playing, but no. You must hop on a ladybug. The ladybug speeds away from the "boss" extremely. Once you reach the giant's house, there's a plate with Jello on it. You have to push it towards the wall, but you probably won't know it at first, since it's a big object to push.Now...the Prince and the Pauper....it's the hardest and final level of the game. You swing, you kill, all that stuff. Unfortunately, I can't explain anymore since you must find about this on your own. Good luck.Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of platform games, Mickey Mouse, or you just want a major challenge, go ahead and buy this game.

Kirby's Avalanche is actually a puzzle game rather than your average platformer. It's actually based off of the Japanese video game puzzle series, Puyo Puyo. In fact, it's just like that, but covered in a Kirby theme.Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine also did this exact same thing, but with a Sonic theme instead.The main game is connecting 3 of the same color. It's as simple and addicting as Tetris and Columns. There's a VS mode, a Training mode (Which is like playing solo in Tetris), and a Story mode. All of the modes are very fun and you can just keep playing them until you're dead tired of puzzle games.The puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting, and it is still a fun game to this day.

If you thought the NES was Nintendo's major big shot, think again. The Super Nintendo triumphed over its previous system with 16-bit graphics and its then-new Mode 7 technology in which it performs glorious fake 3D.The game library is just as huge as the NES's library.The SNES also had its fair share of peripherals, most notably the SNES Mouse and the Super Scope.While the NES lasted from 1985 to 1994, the SNES went on from 1991 all the way to 2003, and yet it still remains to be a popular system! It is that awesome.

Toy Story was an awesome movie. However, is it an awesome cash-in? Actually, the game's pretty good. As Woody, you go through 17 levels that relate to the movie and follow its storyline.The graphics are some of the best on the SNES. In fact, it might look fabulous on the Game Boy Advance!The sounds and music are also just as amazing!The gameplay is also pretty good, but it's always varied, although it's mostly a platform game.However, the game is hard. Although things are easier after beating it once.The storyline is horribly written in the game. For example: "I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going!" However, you'd just skip the storyline cutscenes anyway. What? We've all done it.Since this is the first version of the game released, there are obvious differences between this and the other versions.But overall, this is a good game for the SNES library that you should probably own.

It's kinda odd. The Kirby's Dream Land series has always been on the Game Boy, but then its third game, released in 1997, is on Super Nintendo. I wouldn't say that's a good decision, since the Nintendo 64 was already out by then. But those that still held onto their Super NES systems were in for a good time.If you've played the previous Dream Land games or Kirby's Adventure, you would know what to expect here: Fun platforming combined with being able to steal enemies' powers. What's also cool is that now you can play with a friend or computer player to help you out. It's like the multiplayer elements in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land, but way, way earlier, and plus it has a CPU play with you, too.What stops this game from getting 5 stars, though, is that it has a lack of challenge. Whatever IS challenging at first is then easy as you could understand it within a matter of time. The game has been rather a cakewalk almost throughout the game. But in this case, the walk is a great one, and the cake is tasty.

Street Fighter II is the biggest arcade fighter around. It's no doubt the console versions were also very popular.You get to choose from 8 different fighters, and you must battle other fighters to move onOnce in a awhile, there would be a bonus stage where you get to destroy either a brick wall or a cool car.2-Player pits you against your friend as you get to choose your difficulty setting and your characters. There are two difficulty settings so you and your friend can have a balanced fight.Overall, it's a must-have fighting game for the classic Super NES.

Minigame collections are, admittedly, wearing out their welcome. Seriously. It was annoying to see party games fly out into shelves for people to go out and buy those, thinking they would be as good as promised. While there are exceptions, the minigame genre is fading away quickly. BUT, you know what makes Wario Ware so special? It's unlike anything else out there (Until Spongebob Squigglepants came and went).Wario Ware, Inc. consists of several stages in which you play some of the most bizarre and shortest minigames in the world that fit with a certain genre that each stage contains. For example, there are minigames based off of Nature, Reality (Term used loosely?), Strange, Science Fiction, etc. My favorite stage is >SPOILER ALERT&lt; the one with Nintendo-themed minigames, in which they would be based off of classic games like Super Mario Bros, F-Zero, Dr. Mario, and arcade game Donkey Kong.Each minigame would last only a few seconds (Except for Boss minigames, which aren't timed), and they would show a one-word command (Catch!, Collect!, Stomp!, Get it!, Smash!, to name a few). You use the D-Pad and/or the A and B buttons to figure out how to succeed in the minigame. The result is pretty addictive and fun (Although it could be a bit frustrating at first), especially since there are hundreds more where these minigames came from.After beating all of the stages, you may think that that's all the game has to offer, but NOPE! It turns out that there are bonus games rewarded to you if you either beat all the stages and/or go on to beat all the individual minigames! Ah, Nintendo....you are always so generous to your fans.Some bonus games are remakes of Nintendo's classics, like FULL VERSIONS of Dr. Mario (Despite it being Dr. Wario here) and late 70s arcade game Sheriff! Other addicting unlockables are Pyoro, Pyoro 2, Paper Airplane, and some Vs minigames that have you and your friend play against each other by holding both sides of the Game Boy Advance!Overall, even if the bonus content were absent, this would still be one heck of a game collection! Who would've thought that few-second minigames would spark huge innovation?

Bomberman's basic gameplay is massively addicting. Not only do you get to blow up walls (Or other structures representing walls), but you can also gather up various kinds of power-ups that make things even more fun (Glove lets you pick up bombs, Fire makes the bomb's explosion, the Skull does a surprise effect that'll either help you or make you suffer in play, etc).So there's quite a bit of reasoning as to why Bomberman is striking PCs. I'm pretty sure everyone had a Windows computer in his/her household, so why not make Bomberman that accessible to everyone? Interplay saw this, and as they managed to obtain Hudson's approval, they gave us this.Atomic Bomberman is a pretty spruced up offering in the franchise. The graphics are incredible and eye-popping, the music is catchy and techno-y (However, sadly, there's no music during play), and the atmosphere in general is just pretty awesome. With this new look, you'd think that there would be changes in the gameplay right? Fortunately, there isn't. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. What I think is really impressive is that the game supports online play with up to a whopping TEN people! I'm not exactly sure how to set it all up, considering I own a Windows 7 laptop, but I bet the result is more than worth it!Also, it turns out that the game is pretty customizable. You could make your own Bomberman levels, graphics, and even change the messages! This is difficult for the younger audience to do, since it's all supposed to be done via Text documents and possibly other stuff, but it's still a pretty cool feature for those that can figure it all out.If there's anything I am kinda concerned about, it's the voice acting. It's not BAD, but it feels weird at times. In fact, despite the game rated K-A for Kids-to-Adults (The early E for Everyone rating), Interplay snuck in some voice clips that are rather aimed at teens and beyond ("You blow!" - "Eat my dust and lick my >BLEEP&lt;" - "POOPS!!"). These could actually be heard in-game.Another thing I have a concern about is that, believe it or not, there's a Campaign mode in the game. Unfortunately, it is a totally unfinished state, being composed of random levels and no story. The Campaign mode isn't actually hard to access in the game, though. All you need to do is press C five times in the screen where you get to set up the players/CPUs. Click one of 3 files, and BOOM. You're playing a single-player story mode that the developers left unfinished. So why am I cringing at this? Well, it just makes me feel like as if the game was rushed onto store shelves, seeing a big feature like this cut out.But Campaign and weird voices aside, this is a really terrific game. Definitely check it out!

I might be overrating it, but Sonic Gems Collection is a grade-A collection of the more overlooked Sonic games.It contains several great games from the Sonic franchise. It has:Sonic R: A semi-cheap racing game with Sonic and friends.Sonic the Fighters: A formerly rare arcade fighting game.Sonic CD (HIGHLIGHT): The best Sonic game of all time! Blast Processing at its finest!Sonic Drift 2: A Pole Position-styled racing game for the Game Gear.Sonic Triple Trouble: One of the Game Gear's best games. The best 8-bit offering of Sonic.Sonic 2: This is the Game Gear version, which is entirely different from the Genesis game. It's still great, though.Tails' Skypatrol: A Japan-only Game Gear spin-off in which Tails goes on his own.Tails' Adventures: Another solo spin-off (Better than Skypatrol, though) in which Tails embarks his own platforming adventure.Sonic Spinball: A Game Gear version of the Genesis pinball game.Vectorman (UNLOCKABLE): A run 'n gun game in which you play as a robot shooting his way through several levels of destruction.Vectorman 2 (UNLOCKABLE): A second part to the first Vectorman game.Genesis and Game Gear Demos (UNLOCKABLE): If you play this collection every day, you will be able to unlock a few Genesis and Game Gear games (All of which have been in Sonic Mega Collection and Plus) each day.Along with all of the great games listed, there's also a neat museum where you get to listen to remixes, look at hundreds of images, and play those unlockable Genesis and Game Gear game demos!So. Have I persuaded you enough to buy this?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it: Sonic had sucked in his modern games throughout the middle of the 2000s. Actually, that was what the blue hedgehog was like on his CONSOLE games. His handheld offerings were way better, because they were just plain 2D. Sonic Rush is no exception.While Sonic Rush is, indeed, a 2D Sonic game, it isn't EXACTLY like the Sega Genesis games. In the Genesis titles, there was a mix of platforming and speed. Here, it's a video game equivalent to a roller-coaster ride, complete with some platforms and enemies to kill off. But you know what? It was fun. You also have the graphics and music to help make the game look even better.The graphics are gorgeous. You get a combination of good-looking 3D models of the characters and the 2D backgrounds and platforms. The result is way better than you may think it would be. The music is great, but it's also weird at the same time. Human vocals seem to be used as instruments to go with the music. I just don't know what to say about it, but the music is still nice to listen to.While I do love playing through the game, there are a few flaws that I've noticed. The one major problem is that there are a lot of places where you fall and die. I find myself ending up like that more than getting killed by enemies. The other flaws are pretty minor, but are just awkward. Knuckles makes an appearance in the game, but one line he says is "I'm so angry I want to punch something!" Let's be honest: It's ridiculous to say stuff like that, even if someone's mad. At least it isn't worse than "I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going". A couple of the bosses can get annoying, too, especially since Tails keeps repeating these two lines: "Alright, Sonic!" (When you hit the boss) and "Oh, no, Sonic!" (When you get hit).Still, this is an overall amazing Sonic game. It's a must-have for the DS. Sorry PSP owners, but you got the wrong Sonic series.

The Bonk series may be more well-known on the TurboGrafx16, but the first game, Bonk's Adventure, was on multiple systems. It was on Game Boy, the NES, the Super Nintendo, arcade, etc. Some of these versions, however, seem to have levels that differ from one another. What's up with that?The main gameplay is pretty sweet. If you eat a piece of meat, you get powered up a bit, making Bonk look kinda creepy, but at least your hit points don't drain when you get whacked by an enemy. Eating a bigger piece of meat does both power up AND INVINCIBILITY!!! Bonk can also run faster as he is invincible, smashing enemies in sight, Mario-style.At every end of a round (Except Round 5), there would be a boss. Awesome 8-Bit boss music turns on, and the battle begins. It may seem like a basic fight, but it's possible you may lose a life or two. What I also like about Bonk's Adventure is that when you die, you can just press Start to start up another life at where you had died.Before reaching the final boss, you have to battle the other four bosses again. Kinda like how Sonic 4 had done it. But that's when I realize the full story. A unicorn (as a princess) has been kidnapped by a dragon named King Drool, and now that dragon is taking over her planet. What the heck...? Isn't Bonk a caveman? And the game would end with the unicorn kissing Bonk, causing him to go nuts like when he collects meat. Isn't Bonk a caveMAN? And the princess is a UNICORN?Story aside, it's a really great Game Boy game and you should go buy it for your Game Boy, Color, or even Game Boy Advance.

Are you looking for a unique game? Do you want something that is on-par with those of comedy TV shows, like The Simpsons or online shows like Homestar Runner? Sam and Max: Hit the Road is TOTALLY for you, then.The game is not your average video game. Instead, it is a point-and-click game, an overlooked genre that was popular on computers way back when. Basically, you control the character and guide him by interacting with other characters or objects.However, Sam and Max is probably one of the best in the genre. It is undeniably hilarious! The dialogue is very clever and always gives a good amount of laughs. There are times where I kinda regret not playing the game just because of the verbal comedy.The gameplay, as already mentioned, is pretty simple. You click stuff and interact with those stuff. There are also puzzles along the way to beating the game, but chances are they could not be TOO easy to figure out. Despite that, everything is still great.Not only is Sam and Max a great point-and-click game--It just so happens to contain some minigames, such as Whac a Mole, and there is this crazy "car surfing" minigame in which Max stands atop of the police car, and you must move the car left or right, dodging road signs in the way!With an awesomely funny package like this, you can't go wrong with the Sam and Max series, and this is only the first game.

Well, the Super Mario Bros. Super Show wasn't a bad show, but I wouldn't say it was the best cartoon back in the 80s. The jokes were okay for kids, but there were so many moan-inducing pasta jokes. Fortunately, each episode would show the Mario Bros, Toad, and Peach in an entirely different setting every time. Robo-Koopa (Robocop?) takes place in the future. Raiders of the Lost Mushroom (Raiders of the Lost Ark) takes place in a jungle.There are also 2 Zelda episodes packed in here, featuring the characters of the epic game in all its somewhat epic and ear-plugging glory (EXCUUUUUUSE ME, Princess!). They don't spoof movies and they both take place in Hyrule. This series sticks to the game's setting in a nice way.What I find REALLY weird about this DVD is that Inspector Gadget roams around in the menus. What the heck is Inspector Gadget doing on a Mario DVD? He is from a different show! Another strange thing is that you can click him so he can tell you what the choices do in the menu you click him in. Weird...if you knew how to click on him, I think you would know how everything works in a DVD menu.There is also a trivia quiz in the DVD. It isn't bad, but it feels a bit bland. I also happen to notice a grammar mistake in one of the questions. Despite that, it's decent.Overall, this isn't a bad DVD, but it sure is a really strange one.

I remember when I was overly obsessed with Pokemon. It was all very fun while it lasted. In fact, I used to own this unusual Pokemon card. I've seen it in one of the Pokemon movies, but never before the time would I imagine to get a hold of such an interesting card. It's NOTHING like any Pokemon card you've seen. It's one of the coolest Pokemon promotions I've ever seen. The Holofoil background was just the icing on the cake. From what I remembered, it looked like it came straight out of the Pokemon movie I saw it in (Don't remember which one it was)! Definitely worth getting if you're a collector.

Pac-Man World showed that while people are now looking out for games with guns, explosions, and those other kind of things, there can still be a good game that doesn't need any of that. The sequel has shown the same thing.PMW2 plays a bit like the first game, but with several improvements. For instance, there's a fair difficulty now, and the camera angles are like how it usually would be in an average 3D game.The gameplay is really fun. You have what you had in the first PMW: Rev Roll in a Sonic-like way, Butt Bouncing, and hey, look! Now there's a mid-air flip kick! Pretty useful at times. Like the first game, the gameplay is about eating fruits, dots, and unlocking special mazes. Sometimes, the gameplay can vary when it comes to a certain level where it has to. Like in Blade Mountain, you have to skate through caves and jump up ramps (Like how it's shown on the boxart). In the water levels (except one), it's an on-rails shooter in which you shoot the enemies trying to attack.The mazes hidden in the game are as fun as the original Pac-Man arcade games. Although some are slight redesigns of old Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man mazes, new ones are also in the mix. You can also collect Namco tokens (which are also hidden) to be able to unlock the actual arcade games. If you go to Sue's Arcade in the Pac-Village, you can play the arcade games anytime you want after unlocking them. The games are: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, and Pac-Attack (The only console re-release not counting Virtual Console). You can also play the unlocked mazes there, too.The sound effects are just classic and action-y. The music is also really cool to listen to. B-Doing Woods has a really lively tune to it, and the water stages have a pretty dramatic theme in each.The graphics aren't exactly the best the PC has to offer, but they still look really good and the arcade games are replicated on-screen pixel by pixel.Overall, if you enjoyed the first Pac-Man World, you would NEED to play this one. Better yet, if you haven't played the first one, this is a great place to start, considering how it's released on multiple systems other than Sony's line of Playstation consoles.

Sonic Action Pack is a collection of 4 Sonic classics, with the majority being AWESOME. Sonic CD? Heck yeah! Sonic R? Eeeeehhhh..... Sonic and Knuckles with Sonic 3? HECK YEAH! This makes for a great package that any Sonic fan should really go and buy!I would copy and paste my reviews of those games to here, but I'm afraid people would find it to be pretty long then, so how about you just go and find my reviews for these games? I'm sure that you would be very interested in these brilliant games once you read the reviews. :-)Trust me when I say that you'll be getting some of the best Sonic games of all time (:D) with a mediocre Sonic racing game.

How can I not enjoy this DVD? It's full of hilarious slapstick. Tom and Jerry has always been known for its really funny slapstick comedy and.....slapstick comedy.But that's not a bad thing. That led the series to being adored by critics, fans, comedy stars, and directors. Yes, the craze of Tom and Jerry still lives on.Anyways, this DVD contains tons of the humorous cartoons. No matter what setting the famous duo are in, whether the cartoon is about playing golf, having fun at the beach, or celebrating the Fourth of July, you must be sure to expect the famous slapstick comedy. If you can't enjoy the slapstick, then I have no idea how you will like this collection.Things that build up upon the slapstick make things even more interesting and very clever. Don't you love it when you hear Tom's screams? That's a major gut-buster, no matter how many times you hear them. I also love it when you suddenly hear Tom or Jerry speak an anonymous voice. For example, in this one episode where Tom tries to impress a female cat, he ends up being chased by the dog, but then he whistles and says "Come on, boy! Go get it! Come on!" and then throws the stick that he had in his hands! I immediately cracked up that time.Overall, you just got to have this DVD.

Namco Museum DS is another arcade compilation featuring Namco classics.This selection has these arcade games: Pac-Man, Dig Dug II, Mappy, Xevious, Galaga, Galaxian, and the Tower of Druaga.Pac-Man: That awesome dot-munching classic.Dig Dug II: A terrific sequel to the first game.Mappy: A cat 'n mouse chaser in which you play the mouse and you must collect household items in Pac-Man-like gameplay.Galaga: That awesome shooter everyone should know.Galaxian: That spin off of Space Invaders.Xervious: Fly all around the area shooting enemies!Tower of Druaga: Search for the stairways in a maze, attacking enemies in your way.All of these classics are pretty awesome, but the highlight of this collection is the portable version of the Gamecube's Pac-Man VS!The DS version of Pac-Man VS is a lot easier to set up. All you need are a few DS systems instead of a Game Boy Advance and a GCN Link Cable.The game itself is just as fun. One player plays as Pac-Man while the other people play the roles of the ghosts. When one gets the other player (Pac-Man), that player gets to be the next Pac-Man and the other a ghost. Reach the score of 5000, 10000, or 15000, depending on which you chose, to win the competition.Overall, this is one heck of a good DS value.

Rocky is just a game based off of a movie. A boxing game.Well guess what? You only have 3 people to fight. Compare that amount to Punch Out. The first fighter is really easy, but the second fighter is nearly impossible. How does the difficulty change like that??There are also workout stages, but they only waste your time and use up your finger strength.Overall, this is all you needed to know to figure out how bad it is.

Back in the day, Cartoon Network had awesome shows. Today, they are missing quite a lot of that awesomeness (Still found in Cartoon Planet, though!). However, apparently, we aren't exactly talking about the Cartoon Network cartoons here, now are we? Nooo. We're talking about what you find on Cartoon Network's website free for play. However, back in the day, some of these games held value, and costed a bit of money.Cartoon Cove Mini Golf is what it sounds like - A Cartoon Network-themed mini golf game. It does the job well, with 9 courses taking up the game, each with their own unique gimmick (Johnny Bravo's course is a pinball machine, Time Squad's course features a teleporter). It is a good game, but the courses, even with said gimmicks, feel kinda basic.To The Eds-Treme is a game based off of my favorite CN cartoon, Ed Edd 'n Eddy. Or at least...loosely based. The game has the Eds participate in skateboarding. You score points by doing tricks in mid-air, and you could earn a jetpack power-up to help you perform even more tricks. Mess up your landing or trip over gaps in the half-pipe will make you lose time. The overall result is actually quite addicting, and the Eds' goofy animations help add to the game's charm.However, I can't say this is a good purchase, because you could play these online on the CN website now, without paying at all.

Back to the Future is one of the more popular movie franchises in...the movie industry. The game based off of the movie.....was a bombshell. It isn't even based off of the movie, since there's barely anything that relates to it.You play as a guy who's supposed to be Marty, but doesn't look like him. You walk through streets, collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls. That already sounds nothing like the movie. The music is as annoying as the game itself. It loops until you turn off the game.There is this one scene, however, where you play the guitar (In an awkward way), and different music plays. However, it's not Johnny Be Good. Instead, it's a garbled 8-bit mess.Could the game be any stupider? Yes, it can.

The reason why I chose to play Batman Returns was because I thought the Super Nintendo version looked really satisfying. I mean c'mon! It has what I would like it to be: A really great beat 'em up made by Konami with awesome music, graphics, etc! I never even watched the movie, and yet I'm loving this game.That is what defines Batman Returns on the NES. Konami's straightforward licensed beat 'em up. If you had played Konami's TMNT II - The Arcade Game, then you know what to expect. It plays like TMNT II, but it pretty much holds up on its own, too.Love that music huh? Well, you're gonna be listening to upbeat Konami tunes throughout the game. That's what a true Konami game should have.Batman can use his weapons, like his gun and his Batarang. He can also use a slide attack by pressing A and down at the same time.The problem with the game, though, is how you start with only one life. I guess that's why you have such a big health bar, but I still hate how you have to start with just one life. At least you can find hearts in presents, fire hydrants, or wherever else to refill the health bar.Overall, Konami has done Batman well. I should probably check out the more common Super Nintendo version.

What was Bubble Bobble best known for? The answer: It's multiplayer mode.In Bubble Bobble: Part 2 (which is a direct sequel), you can't play onscreen at the same time with your buddy. Co-op multiplayer is something major that built up the series. The fact that you can't do co-op here is inexcusable.However, other than that, this game plays just like the first Bubble Bobble. There is a new float ability, and there are all-new level designs, but the basic gameplay remains the same. Although, that's actually a small complaint, given how the gameplay is already so good.

Bubble Bobble is a game in which you control two cute dinosaurs in a weird world. You must kill enemies by shooting bubbles at them (they end up inside the bubbles) and then pop them.That became a huge and addicting experience in an 80s arcade game. What's even better was that you get to play with a friend and team up to progress through the game.The NES version is no difference. The graphics, gameplay, and everything else are all the same as what you've seen or heard in the arcade game. Sure, the NES had its limits, but back then, and even today, it's a near-perfect port of a game that people will never stop playing for generations to come.

How did they do it? How did they manage to revive the Three Stooges in such a flawless fashion? They even divided the movie into 3 episodes (Which all follow the same plot, but still!), making it like as if they had created new episodes of the classic slapstick comedy! Believe it or not, this movie fits right into the days of old!While the plot may have a bit of seriousness involved (The Stooges are trying to save an orphanage where they had spent time there due to them never being adopted as kids - And there's sorta more to it, such as attempted murder), it was easily overshadowed by numerous comedy bits (Which come around just as often as in the original show), tons of clever moments, and even the casting alone (The Stooges look EXACTLY like how they were back then, and I didn't think it'd be possible!)!There is so much to like about the Three Stooges movie that it's impossible to tell it all under this one little review. I recommend you go watch the trailers online. Or better yet, you may as well just go watch the movie right now! You will NOT be disappointed! My little brother, my dad, and I went to go see it just today. We each had enjoyed it GREATLY. I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as we did (And maybe you'd get the same kind of nostalgia my dad did).

Dragon's Lair. What a standout in the arcades. It's lazerdisc gameplay was basically a hit-the-right-button kind of thing. If you don't, Dirk would end up dying. It was really simple and sort of a memory thing, but Dragon's Lair proved to be a good game in the arcades. The NES version, on the other hand, is something in which the less we talk about it, the better. It's a side-scroller rather than a lazerdisc game, but it's a totally bombarded one.The graphics are really great for its time, and the sound effects and music are decent, too. But the one thing that kept this game from ever scoring any higher, is the control and gameplay.In the first level, you must go up to the bridge to have a dragon pop out. You must kill the dragon, but it's nearly impossible. There's only one way to ever kill it, and it takes so much patience. By the way, you must be extremely careful in this game. If you make one bad move, you're dead. That's because the controls are so delayed. The graphics and animations really show off, but this is the case in which it shows off TOO MUCH. The environment in the game would have crumbing platforms and enemies, so you must act REALLY fast.Other than the controls are the enemies themselves. They mostly kill you in one hit, despite there being a HEALTH BAR. Yeah, that's right. A health bar in a game with one-hit kills. Very few enemies actually just hurt you slightly.Overall, it's a delayed mess-up of the good ol' arcade game's name. Stay away from it.

Home Alone for Genesis was beyond great, but this NES version is horrible.You play as Kevin, and you must avoid getting caught by the Wet Bandits for 20 minutes. You just run around the house setting traps on them.Going up/down the stairs is a chore, since you must be in a precise spot to do so.The traps look like TV screens. TV screens...not the TV itself.The characters look weird. Kevin's walking animation is awkward, and the Wet Bandits don't look like themselves.At least the music changes. Once you are outside the house, the music changes. The music switches back once you're back inside.If you get caught, the game is automatically over. No lives, no nothing.So don't bother purchasing this unless you're a collector and/or you want to play bad games.

Kirby's Dream Land was a pretty awesome Game Boy game. It had amazing graphics, sound, and gameplay alike. Not only did you run and jump like in other platformers, but you can eat enemies, and spit them out at others! Oh, and you can fly! All of that was pretty exciting to experience in Kirby's debut title. However, Kirby's second game, Kirby's Adventure, is a lot like that in several ways......only SUPERSIZED!!!Kirby's Dream Land was composed of only 4 levels (Not counting King Dedede's castle). Here, there are 7 WORLDS, with a set of levels in EACH ONE! This makes Dream Land look like a demo in comparison. To top off the seemingly huge length, there's a save feature.So what else should you expect from this already great game? Well, this is the first Kirby game in which you can STEAL ENEMIES' POWERS AND USE THEM YOURSELF!!! Note that there weren't a lot of games back then (Or maybe even now) that allowed you to do such a cool thing. See that bad guy with a sword? Holy crap! I can use that sword! How about that Laser Ball over there? Kirby's shooting lasers now!! It..is just plain awesome, and it really adds to the fun gameplay.

The Mega Man series never seemed to end. It just kept going on and on with all of these sequels coming in stores. The weakest one of the NES bunch, however, is Mega Man 5. Now, don't get me wrong. Mega Man 5 is still a very great game. But compared to all the other Mega Mans on the same console, this one just wasn't worth it for most fans. I lost hope when I heard that this just wasn't good enough. Fortunately for me, I loved it as much as the rest.While the music doesn't sound too lively, the series' signature graphics and basic gameplay still shine through greatly. Unfortunately, the gameplay has been hampered by the fact that most of the bosses' powers are terrible. The Power Stone misses everything, the Charge Kick rarely does anything, Star Man's stars are worthless in most cases, and the list would go on. Whatever you do, just stick with your regular power. Even Rush isn't so great here.Although you do have to face those flaws, that still doesn't mean the overall game is bad. The level design is still just as creative as in the other games, and there's still a good challenge in the game. Speaking of challenge, that is kinda lowered down, too. You get a bigger chance of getting extra lives and health restorers. That way, both newbies and long-time Mega Man fans can enjoy the game. I also like how you have to collect M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V letters for a little something extra. It reminds me of how you must collect Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic games for secret endings.All the flaws that I mentioned may be major to some fans, but for me, those are minor complaints.Simply put: Mega Man 5 is still an awesome game.

I'm actually surprised. At first, I was kinda losing hope for this game after hearing that it wasn't as good as MegaMan 3 or 2. But you know what? The people that said those things were wrong. MegaMan 6 was totally worth it.As always, you have eight robot masters to fight. You know what's different here? Two of these guys were actually made by the FANS rather than the creators! Nintendo Power (the magazine) held a contest for designing new robot masters. The winners' robots in this game were Knight Man and Wind Man. Congratulations, guys.The basic gameplay is fun and unharmed in this game. In fact, there are cool new additions here, such as using Rush as a new set of armor. Using the armor, you can either fly (That comes in handy at times) or use super strength. Other fun elements include charging up your Mega Buster and sliding through gaps.While the game is fun, the story feels a little lacking for some reason. In this game, a new villain named Mr. X has attempted to take over, but as it just so turns out, it was Dr. Wily's doing all along. I feel like since this IS the 6th game, it would be expected that Dr. Wily would be doing all this. After all, we are aware that he is a mainstay to the series.As with all of Capcom's 8-Bit games, the graphics are extremely detailed and cool. The music is also well-composed, but I'm not sure if it will remain to be as memorable as the early MegaMan games' soundtracks.But overall, this is a great game and I think you should go buy it. If a copy's too expensive, buy MegaMan Anniversary Collection for Xbox, Gamecube, or PS2.

MegaMan 3....Whoa man....You've played MegaMan 1. You have also bashed your way through the sequel. Now the third game has arrived.Prepare for more precise controls, rockin' 8-Bit music, neat graphic and sound quality, and tough difficulty.MegaMan 3 plays just like the first two games, but this time, there are (once again) eight new robot masters that you must face before getting to Dr. Wily. Each robot has their own stage that you must pass through before actually getting to fight one of them. Once you defeat a robot master, you take his power, and then use it if necessary. Unfortunately, the game is really hard. Thank god there are passwords.What made this game stand out is how the robot masters from MegaMan 2 (Crash Man, Flash Man, etc) come back for an encore.Overall, it's yet another incredible (but tough) MegaMan game that shines through.

What happens if you hand over the Mario license to some other game company? They make a game that isn't as good as Nintendo's Marios. Mario's Time Machine is a good example. It was released for the NES, the Super Nintendo, and the computer. The NES version is the best one out of the 3 versions.The game's story is Yoshi being kidnapped by Bowser. You must gather up the stolen objects from past times and bring them back to where they belong in order to be able to rescue him. It may not be such a great story, but at least the game itself is decent.The game starts out with you navigating Mario in a hall. There are several doors to go into. You go in a door to end up fighting against Koopas in a Mario Bros arcade setting. In educational games, don't forget that you can't die, so there's no challenge whatsoever. You are also able to exit out of the pipes. It's kinda reasonable if you want to go get a different item first, but if you are trying to kill the Koopas, it's possible they can push you out.After killing them all, you get an object from a past time. You must go into the time machine, select a year to go to, and then you warp there.Each year will be in a different setting. 80m (Which is meant to be 80 million years ago) is a land with dinosaurs. Not a lot, but with some. 1969 takes you to space. 1947 is in Russia. There's more, but I don't feel like spoiling them. They would also contain clues for you to figure out what item belongs to the time. They also teach you about the time periods you're in.The area you drop the item at is a bit precise (only a bit, though), so be sure you put in the right place or else a bird will come, take the item away, and then you'll have to go back to the time machine to fight the Koopas again. American Flag --> 1969 On top of the spaceship, Sledgehammer --> 1989 In front of the Guards building entrance, etc.After you put all the items back to where they belonged (Which is about 90% of the game, by the way), you would think that you have to fight Bowser, but it turns out you must pass a 3-question quiz before you do. The questions are at random. They are based off of the clues given in the places. If you get a question wrong, you are forced to return to the level that was themed the same as the question, but you can exit out.After the quiz, you now begin to fight the final and only boss: The hideous reptile himself: Bowser. Wait a second....HE'S ONLY MOVING LEFT AND RIGHT! What kind of boss is this? Bowser only moves left and right. Jump on him 3 times, and he's dead. You rescue Yoshi, and then you win. The End screen looks terrible. I mean, it's not really bad, but Bowser is shown crying. Are you kidding me?To be fair, Mario's Time Machine does manage to bring us something to learn about while at the same time giving us the classic Mario gameplay we love in a twist that is acceptable for the most part. It has its dumb moments, though, but it's still mostly a good game. It's worth to stroll through, although not for non-edutainment players. Plus, how many video games in this decade feature one of gaming's biggest icons teaching you about Abraham Lincoln giving the Gettysburg Address?

MegaMan was a good NES game, but people seem to overlook it. The sequel, on the other hand, grew BIG.The MegaMan series is known for its amazing graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics, precise controls, and frustrating difficulty. MegaMan 2 has all that.You choose from 8 different robot masters, selecting your own order of levels.The level designs are as creative as ever. However, they are also very hard. Luckily, killing certain enemies might give you an orb to restore your health. Or better yet, if you're lucky enough, a 1up! Unfortunately, that won't save you from having to go through Heat Man's puzzling disappearing blocks.Dr. Wily's stage is a total pain in the neck, too. Deathtraps are set here and there.But still, MegaMan 2 is one the best and most frustrating NES games ever. If you are a fan or looking for a challenge, then you should buy this.

You know the one:You roll, you buy, you trade, you build houses, you pay, you auction, and sabotage the other players with your built houses and hotels. You can also land on bonus cards (Chance -- Community Chest) to see what special event will occur. Will you win money, lose money, or just have to go to jail or Go?Monopoly can take a long time to complete, but you will have a fun time as you try to fight off troubles with your cash.This NES replica of the board game we all know actually makes everybody's turns much faster thanks to the simple press-A-button-to-roll-or-buy gameplay. It could be slightly confusing to trade or auction at first, and you will have to pay even more attention to what properties the other players (or CPUs) own, but the extra cartoon-y animations and music make up for it.

Let's take a look at a little trivia, first. Okay? Power Punch II was originally supposed to be a Punch Out sequel, but since Mike Tyson went through...problems, Nintendo scrapped the idea of him being in the sequel. Then, due to the low-quality of the game compared to Punch Out, Nintendo didn't feel like making the game. However, a third-party company went ahead and published the game. The remains of the evidence are the Nintendo trademark of the game and the "II". There is no Power Punch 1. However, a game called Power Punch was released for the Wii, but that's just a coincidence.There are some workout stages in the game, but I find them to be pretty pointless. They don't seem to be identical to the actual boxing matches. You might as well skip the workouts.The fighting is addicting, but it just gets repetitive. You can just bash the alien creature a bunch of times without him attacking back. However, you only take down so little of his HP. He was about twice the amount of HP than you. When he gets to hit you, you better block or fight back. That being said, I don't know if this game is either easy or hard. It's hard to tell.While the graphics are pretty good for its time, I don't think it matches up to what Punch Out had to offer. The music, I can say the same, only except that the music is as repetitive as the gameplay.Overall, it's no wonder it couldn't be qualified as a sequel to an existing game. However, it still leaves evidence.

Batman: Return of the Joker is always seemed to be claimed as some kind of Contra clone (Because of the power-ups) or a MegaMan clone (Because of how the screen scrolls going to the next area). Well, it's not a clone of any of those games. It's its own good game that has a major challenge in it.ROTJ has all of what you would love to see in an 8-Bit platformer: Amazing music, amazing graphics that rival some other games' graphics, and tons of effort put into the game.The game also plays great, although Batman only has a gun. You can get several Contra-like upgrades to the gun, such as being able to shoot it in a spiral-staircase-kind-of-way, and there's even a Spreader upgrade whose directions are only somewhat different.However, there's one thing that just makes the game fall flat: The insane difficulty. It's okay in the first world, but as you go on, there will be lots, lots, and LOTS of cheap deaths. Some may be from multiple hits. Some may be from falling backwards into a hole. Either way, the game is hard as heck.Fortunately, there's a Password feature that has 4-digit passwords. That is some relief right there.The boss battles are easy, too. Well, that is, except for the Joker himself. You and the boss would always have health bars, too. So if you worry about getting hit 7 times and die, you should realize how the health system changed here.Overall, Batman: Return of the Joker is a good game for the NES library, but it's going to be a rough challenge for you.

Ever wanted to see a new take on a game like Pole Position? Rad Racer hit that mark. Okay, so there's nothing TOO new to the Pole Position formula, but Rad Racer is just as fun nonetheless.It kinda has the same basic gameplay as Namco's arcade racer, but that's not really a complaint, since the gameplay is already very good.You can speed up by holding Up. However, that can cause a problem when it comes to turning, so you might want to pull the brakes when a turn comes.The music is well-composed, and the graphics are great for its time.What really makes this game stand out, however, is it's 3D feature. If you press Select, the game switches to classic red-and-blue 3D! Just get those 3D glasses and enjoy the game. Granted, it's dated, but back then, it was huge.Overall, it's a really good take on Pole Position, and it's well worth your money.

Terminator....how do I describe this game? Well, let's say it's just a piece of trash.The gameplay isn't ALL bad. I mean, you do get to have a gun, and you DO get to shoot in selectable directions (Except up or down). However, it's a platformer with the worst jumping control in an NES game. There are even some small tiles that you NEED to jump on to move on, but there's a big chance you can fall THROUGH them. Heck, you can even jump through other platforms, too. So you'll have a really hard time ever beating the first level. If you do manage to get past the first level, you'll be likely to give up.The sounds are dull. The music is a garbled 8-Bit mess. The sound effects are okay, I guess. But it's cruel having to listen to 2 beats over and over again. At least, in the first level, that was what it was like.The graphics are decent, but they could have improved the backgrounds to make them look more Terminator-y.Overall, the gameplay made this game blow up to smithereens. Stay away from it.

The first Tetris was what everybody thinks of as an average puzzle game then and now. But what had become of its sequel, Tetris 2?For Tetris 2, you must line up 3 in a row using the usual Tetris shapes, as well as a few new shapes. It is a cool spin off of both Tetris and Dr. Mario. In fact, even the setup is similar to Dr. Mario. You can choose from Slow, Medium, or High falling blocks, 20 levels, and 3 different tunes.Unlike Nintendo's Tetris 1, you get to play against a friend. You can also face a computer player.It's another addicting puzzler that is as much fun as the original.

Back then, ET and the Atari version of Pac-Man had the gaming industry destroyed in 1983. Two years later, Nintendo created the NES and, along with Super Mario Bros, it saved the gaming industry.Super Mario Bros is a terrific NES game that would always remain fun until the day we die.The gameplay is what you would expect from a 2D Mario game: Collecting powerups, top-notch platforming, coins, enemies, etc...The graphics were good at the time.The sounds and music were great, especially at the time. To think some of those noises became iconic ones in Nintendo's world of games.The game is pretty long: You have to go through 8 worlds (4 levels in each) and, if you want, do the harder quest, which replaces Goombas with Buzzy Beetles.Overall, you have to get this game, especially if you are a Mario fan or you want to learn about the video game history.

Don't get me wrong. Tetris is a great game. The block-dropping gameplay is seriously addicting. However, the game is only for one player, and there are no special features other than the song choices.Tengen's Tetris is actually a lot better. If you don't believe me, take a good look at my review for it or watch gameplay videos.

Contra was such a great game in arcades. Heck, it got ported to NES. The NES version gained more popularity, however. Heck again! It has a sequel!Super C is what you expect from the Contra series. You can do everything that you can do in the original Contra. Shoot in all directions, with several different power-ups to find, and bad guys to shoot the ever-loving heck out of!It seems like a direct sequel, but who would ever want to mess with the already perfect Contra formula?The music, though, is more fantastic than the first game's music! Not only does it have really cool beats and stuff, but there's also a kind of beat that you can't hear from any other NES game!The only problem is that it's too hard. The first Contra was hard, but then there was the Contra Code. It gave you 30 lives. The Contra Code only unlocks a sound test in this game. Not bad, but not good when you're struggling through a level.

In 1988, when Nintendo was developing Super Mario Bros. 3, someone said "Oh my god! We forgot to make a Mario 2 for North America!"So they made one out of Japan-only game Doki Doki Panic. And everybody liked it...until they found out what was done to make it.Super Mario Bros 2 differed a lot from the first Mario game. Mainly because of its origin. You throw veggies at your enemies, there's a mini-boss at the end of every level, you get to choose from 4 characters, and Bowser isn't the main enemy. And you know what? All that was awesome. The music and sounds were kind of what you expected in a Mario game, but note: Doki Doki Panic had the same music and sounds.The graphics, while of course, used from Doki Doki Panic, were still pretty impressive.Overall, while this wasn't designed to be a Mario game, it was a lot of fun like one.

Super Mario Bros 1 was one of the best NES games ever. Mario 2 had everything changed. Mario 3......became the best game on the NES, and with great reason: It took everything that made the first SMB awesome and multiplied it by 100x.The graphics were improved and were well-created in its time and on the NES.The sounds were even better, although some were recycled (No complaints about that, though).The gameplay was a truckload of awesomism. New powerups, new levels, new experiences, etc!2-Player mode was incredible compared to the one in SMB1. As you both play as Mario and Luigi, you guys can clear levels for each other (Or just die on purpose so the other player can play the harder levels), and you can battle each other in a recreation of the Mario Bros arcade game. You either knock down 5 enemies, get 5 coins, distract the other player, or jump on him/her to take the panels they collected at the end of the regular levels.So I'm pretty sure this game has enough for you to sink your gaming teeth in.

To be honest, I've never seen the movie, Wayne's World. However, I've played the DOS game, and I've watched a Saturday Night Live sketch of it. Apparently, this NES game is supposedly based off of the movie. However, it's a side-scroller, and not what you would have expected, either.Wayne and Garth venture across a level with the most random enemies and level designs you can possibly imagine. The majority of the graphics aren't totally detailed, the music is okay, and the gameplay....well, let me explain it.In the first level, you begin as Garth, who is equipped with a gun. There happen to be no gaps in the floor whatsoever, so you can just walk across, shooting the enemies that come toward you. The second part of the level has you play as Wayne, but he doesn't carry a weapon. Instead, he kicks. In order to actually kill enemies with the kick, though, you have to time it right. If not, then you get hit by the enemy. At the end of each level, you come to a donut shop. This gives you a chance to restore your health for the next level.As Garth in the second level, all you have to do is go jump up the platforms to the door, which is cakewalk. This is the shortest part of the game. Then you get this strange cutscene in which the duo says "Party on, Garth!" and "Part on, Wayne!". That's just pointless. Now as Wayne, you jump from platform to platform. This provides a nice challenge, since there are fair enemies that are on top of a few platforms. They don't move, however. At the end, you find a muscular guy to kill. Sadly, he doesn't move, too. But then again, there's not enough room to move, so I guess it's reasonable why these guys won't budge. After that's over, a girl rushes to Wayne. Then you get a cutscene, which reveals that this must be his ex-girlfriend. How? Because he insults her for the gun rack she is holding. Eeeesh. Then, there's another guy to beat up. As you go to the stage, you find another girl. Maybe it's his current girlfriend?? When you walk to her, you beat the level. That was strange....she is a door? How'd you end up in the donut shop? This is just another pointless part. Why did we need to see the girls? There's no point. After all, it doesn't impact on anything in the game itself, so why's this necessary?The third level has you play as Garth once again. This time, you actually beat the level with him. During the whole level, however, you have to fight cats and ninjas. The ninjas are really annoying. Even though they use the same jump-kick attack, they are just brutal if you don't act fast, especially since they come out of nowhere. Mainly, I would just inch my way across, so I can be prepared when the ninja pops out. This way, things are easier.The fourth level is the worst of the bunch. You're Wayne the whole time, and I guess you're in some TV factory. TV screens are your enemies, and they're slightly (only slightly) more difficult to attack. In the next 2 parts, you end up encountering spiders and painful waterdrops. What's even more brutal about this level is that you must maintain your health throughout all 3 of these parts, and there are some major dangers in the way. Oh well...at least this is the only hard level.Guess what? The fifth level is actually your last. The game is very short for a movie licensee. Here, there's a cutscene that finally fits in the game. Garth is aware that they happen to be in the wrong apartment (?) and Wayne must go up the building. to see what's up (no pun intended). The only enemies here are cats and flying newspapers (It's windy). Really, you may as well jump over the cats and avoid the newspapers. After two parts of climbing up the building, you fight a muscular dude who happens to be the final boss. Yeah, there are bosses in the game. I just didn't mention them because they feel like ordinary enemies that last longer. So, you're supposed to defeat this guy and then you win the game. Yes, the ending sucks.After all of what I played through, I faced bland level design, okay music, random enemies, random places, not-so-detailed graphics, and pointless scenes. Even though all of this is present, I, strangely, actually liked playing through the game. While it's all dull, the gameplay was somewhat entertaining. So overall, it is one heck of a strange crap. There are several things in every part of the game that should have been improved upon (Level design) or removed entirely (Cutscenes).

If you like puzzle games similar to Tetris, then Dr. Mario is right up your alley.Dr. Mario contains 20 levels of virus-bustin' difficulty.The game is a simple 4-in-a-row type of puzzler. Back then, it was pretty unique and was thought of being obviously inspired by Tetris.It's a really addicting puzzle game, but things are even more fun on the Game Boy because of its portability.

Ah, the MegaMan series. It is probably the hardest Capcom series ever. While the gameplay is unique and solid, and the graphics and sounds are just plain amazing for the NES, the games are also known for their extremely hard difficulty.The first MegaMan is no different (Okay, maybe a little) from that. The title screen is basic, despite the logo, and there are 6 bosses compared to the other games' 8. The screens are more basic looking.However, the main game is what you would expect from a MegaMan game. Having to go through huge levels to get to fight the robot masters at the end of each level, and then you fight Dr. Wily after going through yet another frustrating stage.It's awesome.I don't know what else to say.

Welp, it was the mid-90s. The NES was about to end its life with its last few games. Wario's Woods is one of those games, despite also being released for the Super Nintendo. This is rather the more well-known version, though, due to its recent re-release on Wii Virtual Console. That and it's also unlockable in Animal Crossing.Wario's Woods is, shock, a starring role for Mario character Toad (Wario's the villain). The game is an actually very interesting line-up-3-in-a-row kind of puzzle game in which Toad is playable in the play field, along with all of these colored creatures lying around. Although you must stack 2 creatures alongside each other, you must have the row contain a bomb either in between or at an end. You can line them up horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally. The result is an extremely addicting game that's as fun as Tetris.Things get more challenging when Wario comes into the scene, in place of pink harmless dinosaur Birdo. He spawns a few more creatures that you must destroy AND he makes the ceiling tumble slightly downwards! But don't worry. It doesn't last too long. Birdo would soon come back and resume watching without any gimmick up her (his?) sleeve.2-Player surely has people go to their competitive senses. If you like battling against your friend in puzzle games, this won't disappoint.So overall, this is a really big puzzler. It's recommended especially for puzzle fans.

Sonic CD Review:Every Sonic fan knows the old-school Sonic lineup: Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuck- Wait! Are you saying I'm missing one? Oh yes I am! Sonic 1, Sonic 2, SONIC CD, Sonic 3, etc!Sonic CD was released for the notorious Sega CD, an add-on for the Genesis. It was the only game on the add-on to sell around a million copies.Sonic CD took what made Sonics 1 & 2 so awesome, and multiplied them by 10! This game has all the high-speed Sonic action you could ever want. The new zones were better than ever. In the Special Stages, you navigate Sonic around roads to destroy UFOs to gather Chaos Emeralds; a unique goal for a Special Stage.The music and sounds are extremely amazing thanks to the compact disc.The graphics are really great. There are even animated cutscenes!Overall, this is one Sonic game you have gotta try! It's the best Sonic game ever!===================================That was my Sonic CD review. Now to talk about Sonic and Knuckles Collection.This collection features Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, and of course, both games put together (Lock-on).It has the same high-speed action you would expect from the previous Sonic games, but now it got even better (Doesn't beat CD, though).The games are really lengthy and very fun. I recommend this collection to all Sonic fans.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles dominated the late 80s and 90s. Konami helped seal the popularity with its TMNT video game series, in which the games are thrilling beat 'em ups. However, it seems that the company decided to try something new. After all, the era was looking at games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters is a game that plays like the fighting games of its time (aka MK and SF2). There is a good amount of content. Such game modes present are Story, Vs CPU, 2P Battle, and Tournament Mode.===Story Mode===You get to play as one of the four Ninja Turtles. Unfortunately, the game is actually shorter in length than other fighting games, consisting of only 6 fighters to battle against, as well as a bonus stage. It is, though, still very fun.===Vs. CPU===Exactly what it sounds like, you can just go ahead and fight a quick match against a computer player. Of course, you can fight the CPU as much as you want.===2P Battle===Hey! Every fighting game has to have a versus mode against a friend, right?===Tournament Mode===In this mode, which is probably the highlighted feature (?), you get to pick how many players are playing, as well as the CPUs.During a battle, you and the other player (CPU or not) are in a rather cool-looking location, beating the heck out of each other. You know, it's like how fighting games were back in the 90s. BUT there is a unique hook to it. Eventually, Splinter (who is trapped in a TV) drops down an orb that, when obtained, can be used for special attacks (Hadoken!). This makes the fighting seem more interesting in a way.In a nutshell, it's your average 8-Bit Konami game: Awesome graphics, sounds, and gameplay alike in one classic fighter. There aren't a lot of NES fighting games, if any (This being the exception), so why not give this a shot and pop it in your ol' Nintendo console for some intense action?

The Atari 2600's ET movie based-game and its version of Pac-Man were responsible for causing the video game crash of 1983. Two years later, Nintendo made a strategy to release the NES as a toy! Thanks to that strategy, we are still playing video games today.The NES is open to a wide range of awesome games and peripherals, most notably Mario, Zelda, ROB, and the infamous Power Glove.Most of the games had simple controls, but they were ending up being excellent games.For under $60, you can't go wrong with buying this classic console.

Okay, so Batman Forever on the Genesis wasn't actually that bad of a game. It's Batman Mortal Kombat mixed in with platforming. It may not have the best control scheme (Press Up + C and B, all at the same time, to use the grappling hook), but it wasn't harmful enough to ruin the game. However, the Game Gear version was ruined forever.The main situation is that you have to beat up all the enemies in an area to progress. And there are platforms that are above Batman with enemies atop. With the Game Gear having no C button, it seems that Acclaim didn't implement being able to go up there and down correctly at all. I keep mashing buttons to see how to go to the above platforms. Guess what? I was never able to figure it out whatsoever, leaving me unable to get past the first room in the game. Unbelievable.

Virtua Fighter Animation can be best described as the Game Gear equivalent to Virtua Fighter 2 for Genesis...except while the visuals and soundtrack are rich and detailed, the gameplay is totally lackluster here. There was at least an appealing challenge in VF2 Genesis. Here, the dumb-as-rocks AI makes it all totally easy. And you don't even get to start the game with all characters.That's right. You have to unlock all characters as you progress in the game. But even then, you can just simply button-mash that same Punch button over and over to win. Once you unlock Kage, and play as him, the game then becomes a 100% cakewalk, because even when the computer player blocks your attacks, you can still button-mash to push him/her off the arena and still win.Virtua Fighter Animation is a masterpiece in presentation. The actual game is garbage.

Mortal Kombat, like any game, would happen to have multiple versions of itself. It is even ported onto the Sega Master System, the Game Gear, and the Game Boy.They are all the same game, but they differ by music and color.The Game Boy version, however, suffered from one fatal flaw: The slow gameplay. The gameplay is REEEAALLLLYYY slow.Thankfully, the Master System and Game Gear versions didn't have that problem, making them playable.The gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting fun, although without the blood and gore. There are only 6 characters, unfortunately, so if you are a person who plays as Johnny Cage often or someone else that dropped out, then this is bad news for you.The graphics are great and they almost match the arcade game's graphics style....kinda.So after you fight several enemies, you would later fight a mirror version of your character. After that, you begin to fight one person after another. That will happen 3 times before you fight the final enemy. This makes the game stand out from the crowd.There are 3 difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, and Hard, so everybody can have a shot at it.Overall, this is a good game that you should purchase for your Game Gear. Or maybe you can get a Master System version, instead. Don't get the Game Boy version, though. I'm warning you.

Rayman is a great platforming series. In fact, Rayman 2 remains to be one of the greatest 3D platformers of all time. The original Rayman is also heavily recommended by critics alike. On handhelds, the Rayman series had followed the original's 2D platforming, as well as expanding upon it.So how does Rayman 3 stack up? Well, it captured the first game's 2D gameplay the best out of the 3 handheld games, considering that the other two games were released for the Game Boy Color (Not counting Rayman Advance). Instead of being a 3D adventure like its console siblings, Rayman 3 breathes new life on the Game Boy Advance by using its 2D platforming gameplay at its finest.The game also borrows things from the console versions of Rayman 2. You can place spheres onto the triangles to open doors, ride Shells (walking missiles), and even fight the first boss the same way as you do in Rayman 2! Heck, even the familiar battle music plays when you fight an enemy! It's almost as if this game was closer to Rayman 2 than the Game Boy Color game. You know....to come to think of it, it was rumored that this was originally going to be a version of Rayman 2 for the Game Boy Advance. That could have been possible, but it's unknown why that was scrapped.You can't help but to bring up a smile as you play through Rayman 3's gorgeously detailed levels. They are all filled with fun and gimmicks. So overall, this is a must-have for your Game Boy Advance. If you want to play a 2D Rayman game for a console again, buy this for the Game Boy Player (add-on for the Gamecube).

Mario Vs Donkey Kong was one of the most fun Game Boy Advance games I've ever played, mainly because it retained the action/puzzle platforming from the Game Boy's Donkey Kong (Which is one of the best games on that system). The graphics and levels were equally well-polished. As for this sequel, though, it drops the enemy-throwing, hopping and bopping, etc, for having to control Mini Marios. Actually, this makes for a very interesting change in gameplay, and it offers some deep elements.So...yeah. Mario Vs Donkey Kong 2 has you guide the Mini Marios around the level with your stylus, proving to be a good example of what you can do with the touch screen. But as you move them around, there are enemies, springs, and power-ups along the way. It is awesome getting the Fire Flower, since the Mini Mario that collects it automatically shoots fireballs at the enemies ahead...The level designs are very interesting and clever. Getting past some of them requires you to really concentrate. The worlds the levels are in totally vary from each other, so when going to another world, be sure to expect something new coming up. For example, there will soon be magnetic floors, as well as pipes that will take the Minis to a different area in the level.The best feature in the game is the Construction Site, which allows you to make your very own witty levels, and even share them with friends that own the game. That alone would make the game worth it.Overall, this is truly a great DS game. It is definitely one to pick up for all puzzle game fans. However, I prefer the original MVSDK.

Despite the fact that the Three Stooges is one the funniest comedy series EVER, it all had a very strange history (Notably Curly and whoever replaces him dies). Believe it or not, the video game based on various Stooges films also had a weird history. It was developed for Amiga and DOS, was later licensed by Activision for NES, and was eventually released onto the Game Boy Advance. Now we have a Playstation version, which is a port (GBA) of a port (DOS/Amiga).===GAME REVIEW===This could have been any kind of game, really. It could have been a platformer with the license stapled onto it. But nope. Instead, the developers have taken a more minigame-based approach with said minigames being based off of classic Stooges films! This was what had me curious. And the game itself was certainly no disappointment.The game involves the Stooges attempting to save an orphanage (Is this where the recent movie had its storyline from?) by getting $5000 dollars. More important than that, it has you participate in a cracker-eating contest, get jobs as doctors or waiters (Pie fight!), etc. All of which are definitely based on Stooges films. However, to play a certain minigame, you have to select one in a Roulette-ish fashion. Do not select the mousetraps!Although there's sort of a limited number of minigames to play, there is also a trivia game (For hardcore fans only) as well as a chance for Moe to beat the heck out of the other 2 Stooges in that same humorous style as in the original series. There would also be an opportunity to collect bonus money.Even if you hadn't checked out how the game plays, the mere presentation would totally appeal to you. The first thing that happens on-screen is that the game happens to have a title screen for some other game. Then the Stooges come, and Curly says "Hey! We're in the wrong game!" I cracked up when I saw that! Not to mention, the game throughout has neat comedy bits to stay faithful to the series. The music was a little wonky, but the graphics were pretty neat (Although I'm not sure those that played this version first would say the same), and there's a good amount of voice samples from the trio.Overall, if you are a Three Stooges fan, or if you like playing solo minigame collections (Such as...Rayman Raving Rabbids??), this is for you.

Everybody loves the popular board game, Monopoly, right? Well this digital version may not be a real game board, nor are its tokens real, but it actually holds just as much memories, if not more! It is complete with features identical to the original game, along with being able to change those rules, computer AI, great-sounding music, and convincing 3D graphics.If you like playing Monopoly, and if you own a Windows 95 (or a virtual version on a newer computer) definitely pick this one up. It's also good for playing if there's no one around who would want to play the real board game. Heck, it even works on Windows 7, so the beautiful graphics, music, etc can now be heard and seen in an all-new generation!

We all know that the Three Stooges is mainly about its clever wit when it comes to the infinite amount of comedy bits throughout each short film in the series. But apparently, the first film, Woman Haters, didn't originally look at that direction. Sure, that comedy is still present, but it doesn't come as much as you'd expect.Another thing about Woman Haters is that it's entirely rhymed. It's actually very clever, but when it comes to the Stooges SINGING, then it just feels totally weird. After all, no other Stooges film was like this, but the fact just makes the film lose its appeal. Woman Haters remains to be a historical curiosity, and it's only for those that wish to see where the Three Stooges series started.

Many people seem to mistake this for the arcade version even given the fact that it's part of the "Classic NES Series" of Game Boy Advance ports to celebrate 20 years of the NES.So here's the NES version of Donkey Kong, ported to the Game Boy Advance, unedited and unharmed in any way.However, you might overlook this since Super Mario Bros and Zelda are also ported to the GBA.

Pac-Man, before Donkey Kong, was an even bigger smash hit in the arcades.The NES port of the game does pretty well.The graphics, sounds, and gameplay are all at least the same as the original arcade game.Sadly, since this is the port of the NES game, that's the one thing that's on the cartridge.Pac-Man can do a lot better in modern consoles if it either costs less or is in a game collection (Namco Museum).For $25, you can find tons of better games that fit that price.

It is the mid-90s. Video game companies are still at in a big competition that has a never-ending finish line. The Nintendo 64 comes with Super Mario 64 as a launch title, and the Sega Saturn arrives into the scene with....a remake of Sonic 3D Blast. What the heck, Sega? The Saturn launch title is a rehash of a Genesis game. This proved that Sega just wasn't trying anymore. That is, until the Dreamcast came and went. However, there was another Sonic game that was originally going to be made, but ended up being scrapped. That game was Sonic Xtreme, which promised to be a full 3D Sonic adventure with a pre-Mario Galaxy kind of mix of environments.Now because Sonic Xtreme is cancelled, the Saturn is long forgotten and it doesn't have an original Sonic game. That doesn't mean 3D Blast is a bad choice to release for the system, though.Sonic 3D Blast is a radical departure from the other classic Sonics. It takes gameplay from the Flicky arcade/Genesis game, and throws Sonic action and great fake 3D into the blender!The music is really well-done and it sounds kind of...heavenly. But I rather prefer the Genesis version's music because those pieces of music are more memorable and catchy. The graphics are truly a big step up from the Genesis game, I'll give it that.There are so many zones in this game that you probably wouldn't have time to finish the game. The bad part about that is that there's no saving or loading, BUT the closest thing to that is the level select. The level select can only be accessed by a button code. The version for the Sega Genesis can be tilted to access it. It's secretive, yeah, but it's the closet thing to a save feature. That's what makes it superior over the Saturn game: Easy level select access.The main gameplay is about saving Flickies after you kill the Badniks. Then you must toss 'em into a giant ring that lets you go to the next part of the level.Shields are still present. There's the regular shield, the fire shield, and a golden one that lets you use the Homing Attack, a new addition to Sonic games since Sonic Adventure, in which that game and so on lets you use it as a normal attack.Overall, the Flicky/Sonic style action has made a unique twist on the series, but I would rather stick with the Genesis game.

The Sonic games for the Sega Genesis are platforming masterpieces that should never be forgotten....literally. Sega always re-releases the original Sonics in numerous video game collections, such as Sonic Mega Collection, Sonic Classic Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, you know, to name a few. But this is the first re-release with all four of the original Genesis titles together.In this collection, you get to play Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and Sonic and Knuckles (complete with Knuckles in Sonic 2 and 3). All of those games feature the fast-paced high-speed action that Sonic was known for. While they are re-released classics, there are now new difficulty modes for all of the games: Easy, Normal, and Original (Of course, you know what Original means). In Easy mode, there are actually some stages ENTIRELY REMOVED so the game(s) can be completed easier. The Spin Dash is also added in Sonic 1 when you play either Easy or Normal mode.Not having to worry about the lock-on technology, the Knuckles versions of Sonic 2 and 3 are also playable. In Knuckles in Sonic 2, you just play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. That makes the game more fun in a way, but beware: He doesn't jump as high as Sonic does. Only almost. On the other hand, Knuckles in Sonic 3 combines Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles, making it one huge Sonic game with twice the number of zones Sonic 3 originally had. Plus, Knuckles is a selectable character, as you can tell already. There's also Blue Sphere, but that's a full game version of the special stages in Sonic 3 (and Knuckles).Also in this collection is a game mode where you can play in a 3D world, collecting rings, reaching markers, or finding Tails as missions. While the missions are exciting, you can also go to a museum and view Sonic's history, artwork, advertisements, and music. You can also watch the cutscenes from the best Sonic game of all time: Sonic CD (Sonic 2's a close second). One thing I also find interesting is the advertisement for Sonic Ride, a virtual roller coaster ride for arcades that never saw the light of day.Overall, this collection is very big, and if you're a Sonic fan in any way, this is a must-have....unless you don't own a Saturn.

Okay, I gotta be honest. I never wanted to review a Leapster game due to the fact that all of them are educational and all of them won't seem pretty fun to older people. However, I think this might be an exception. Sonic X is obviously based off of the anime cartoon series of the same name. Right when you start a new game, Chris introduces himself. Man, do we all hate him or what? Then Sonic comes and realizes Eggman has captured his friends. Of course, us non-children might find these kind of scenes to be corny.The gameplay is semi-stripped down Sonic action with math problems. It's actually kinda fun and provides a challenge for those who are trying to learn basic math. There are also some pen-heavy problems, too.The graphics are great. Sprites are taken cleverly from the older Sonic games, and everything looks pretty neat.The sounds and music are okay for a Leapster game, but of course every Leapster and Leap Frog product has to have that voice that tells you the problems.So overall, this is an excellent game for your kid. If he/she is still in Kindergarten or up to 3rd Grade, this game will entertain him/her for a long while.

Of course, you could just go read the other reviews, but in case if you're still not sure, or if this is the first review you've seen, lemme tell you this: This thing is definitely a must-buy if you are wanting to keep your Super Nintendo (SNES) alive. I haven't tried it out for the NES (Which is why you should go read another review), but the Genesis certainly won't work with it. This is why it has a 3-star review. It depends on the system you own. The Sega Genesis won't work with it, but the NES and Super Nintendo do.

I really like Space Harrier. Very much. But when it comes to an 8-Bit port on the Game Gear, you're going to have to expect ugly graphics while also expecting the familiar shooting gameplay.The sprites on the Game Gear don't look like as if they're on the ground. It looks like they are rather destroying the ground, because there are blue spaces around the objects. That's terrible.At least the 3D-ish shooting gameplay is still addicting. There are 18 stages, with the last stage being having to destroy all of the bosses over again. Each stage has tons of obstacles to either avoid or shoot through as you maneuver your way through the level killing everything.It's too bad that the Game Gear version just doesn't fit the 3D gimmick well. That and there's a little less room for you to dodge upcoming attacks.

Ms. Pac-Man was, as we all know, a smash hit in the arcades. The Game Boy version had barely anything unharmed. However, if you buy this, then you'll only be getting the Ms. Pac-Man game, with no options (Except for 2-Player and Hard Mode).

The original Super Mario Land was a great game, but it was strange. Super Mario Land 2, while the setting is stranger, sticks closer to the Mario series' splendid gameplay. Along with the Mario Galaxy games, however, this game shows how far Nintendo can be creative with the designs.It turns out that Wario distracted Mario in the first game by sending alien Tatanga to kidnap Daisy. So, he's the main bad guy, whereas Tatanga serves as a boss in the space world. Space world? Yup, there are 6 different worlds, and all of them have really weird settings. EXAMPLES: Macro Zone pits Mario into a giant house. Mario Zone is actually a factory that, on the outside, is shaped like the plucky plumber.Although the settings are weird, that actually allows Nintendo to push the company's creativity to their furthest. I mean, seriously, Mario is seen SWIMMING IN WATER that is ATTACHED TO THE CEILING! Not to mention, he can also run across giant Lego blocks, float in space, and fight actual sharks! Never would we have known that Mario would be able to go outside the Mushroom Kingdom by this much.This game is the Super Mario World of Game Boy games, and that's saying a lot. The main gameplay is what you would normally expect. You can run, jump, stomp enemies, bash blocks, and spin jump your way through about 25 nicely detailed levels. The main power-ups are, as you expect, the Mushroom and the Fire Flower. Yes, that's right. The SuperBall flower that was in the first game got replaced by the return of the Fire Flower. Not only that, but there's also the Bunny Hat, which allows Mario to float in the air for a short period of time, similar to the Super Leaf in Super Mario Bros 3. But here, you can float longer than in Mario 3.The challenge is fair most of the time, but the problem with it is that once you get a Game Over, you lose a Golden Coin that you have been rewarded from one of the bosses you fight. So, you must go back and fight the boss again. Let's hope you don't die too many times.But overall, this is a really great game. If you're looking for a good Mario game for your Game Boy, Color, or Advance, ORDER THIS GAME NOW!

Remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game Konami created? Well, it just so happened to lead to lots of other games in the series, like the NES TMNT, Turtles in Time, Tournament Fighters, etc. Well, Around those times, Konami created a Game Boy TMNT game. At first, I had no idea what the heck it would be like. Would it be a platformer like the first NES game? And then it was released.....and blew us off with awesomism.Fall of the Foot Clan is a beat 'em up, similar to the arcade games, but with the look of a sidescroller. The action is much more atraightfoward and simpler compared to other games (Most enemies die in one hit), but it's also very well-polished. The graphics and music are extremely appealing to the eye/ear. In fact, some tunes sound like they could be right at home on the Sega Genesis. Konami really knew how to rock out that Game Boy sound chip!The game may be short, as it has 5 stages (And for some reason, it has a stage select, meaning you can just go to Stage 5 to beat the game), and it may have the Turtles put on an awkward smile throughout the game, but all in all, Fall of the Foot Clan is an epic classic!

Super Mario Land is a classic Mario game and one of the first games for the then-new Game Boy. It features the great gameplay that hailed from Super Mario Bros, although few physics are a little bit off. The graphics and sounds were greatly-developed, especially the music.SML is one of the few games that prove that even the game with the smallest length can succeed. There's only 12 levels, not counting the harder quest (Yup. This game has a harder quest like in SMB).Also, Mario Land may be fun and all, but who knew it was so strange?There's no Bowser, Peach, or even the Mushroom Kingdom, but instead, you romp through Egypt, chasing an alien named Tatanga who has captured Daisy. And that's just the setting. In-game, there are Koopas with bombs for shells, robots, and when you go to World 4, it turns out that world takes place in Japan, as hinted by the music! The Fire Flower isn't even a Fire Flower. Instead, you get to shoot Superballs, which are rubber version of fireballs that can bounce off walls.Despite all that strangeness, it's pure Mario action in the palm of your hand.

Mortal Kombat II was always known as the pinnacle of the long-running series (To think Mortal Kombat 9 is coming). While MK2 dominated arcades and home consoles once again, the question is: Did it do well on Game Boy? It wasn't probably sold as much as the game's console cousins, but the game was great.You choose your character (out of 8) and fight 10 other fighters, each with their own abilities. This goes for all of the Mortal Kombat games (Not in these specific #s though). The gameplay is pure arcade fighting on the go. The graphics are awesome, and the sounds/music were great.The downside, however, is the fact that there are only a few arenas in this port. Plus, the game could be beaten in about 10 minutes or so. But, is it worth replaying? Yes. It truly is. MK2 is probably the best of the Game Boy Mortal Kombats.

Mortal Kombat dominated arcades and home consoles worldwide, but did it dominate handhelds? No. No it did not. The Game Gear version was fairly good, but the Game Boy port suffered from really slow gameplay, dull music, and no sound effects. The graphics were okay, but it didn't help keep the Game Boy version from getting a fatality.This is possibly the worst Mortal Kombat game.

Centipede was one of those arcade shooting games in which you just have you think to yourself, "Oh, man! I gotta play this game!" And then as you play it, you wouldn't stop. You just want to keep shooting at the strolling centipedes and spiders. Then, once you get a Game Over, you'd pop in some more quarters, wanting to keep playing.This Game Boy version is just as great as the arcade game. And of course: You don't have to spend truckloads of quarters.What's even better about this version is the multiple multiplayer modes. There's Alternative, Competitive, and even Co-op! The only drawback, though: Name one person who has a Game Boy/Color and a Link Cable to go with it. If you do manage to find such a person, however, you'll have a blast with him/her in this game.I thoroughly recommend you buy this, especially if you're a die-hard arcade fan.

Frogger is another one of those classic arcade games that any gamer should jump into. Whether it's on the old-school Atari 2600, or in one of the many game collections being released in recent times, Frogger is a game that should have been played at least once in one's lifetime.This Game Boy version, however, isn't all that amazing. The graphics look very shrunken down, with the color just looking odd, and the catchy music of the original seems to be nearly absent, as the first few notes only play as intro music. Otherwise, it's still that arcade classic on the go.But honestly, there are much better versions or games of Frogger. The Sega Genesis version is EXACTLY like the arcade game (Everything's untouched), and the Playstation version is a whole adventure, but stays true to the classic gameplay. Speaking of which, Frogger 2 is the best pick for Frogger on the go. See my review for that one.

If you have played Golf before, then you know what to expect: 18 holes, swing at the ball, aim for the hole. There are two courses to choose from: US Course and Japan Course. The holes would take place in, obviously, America or Japan.The one problem I have with this game is that it can be difficult to get a Par or anything above that point. It's still just as fun to play as real golf, though. There are different clubs to choose from, and the holes are well-designed, despite the difficulty getting a Par and above.Not only is this Golf, but it's Golf on the go. You can play through the 18 holes in the US and Japan courses while in the car. Meanwhile, several other golf games pop up over the years. This is still one golf game you should try out, though. I really have nothing else to say. All I can say now is: It's golf, and golf is a good sport.

Wario Land II is where the series really came into its own. The original's gameplay was a hugely modified from Super Mario Land 2 to replace Mario's block-hitting and Goomba-stomping with enemy bashing, Ground Pounding, and crazy powers that help improve your regular bashing attack. This game may not have those power-ups, nor does it have any evidence of Mario Land 2, but it surely took all of the great original elements of the first Wario Land and made it 5 times better.The graphics look amazing on the old-school Game Boy, and the sound effects/music are just as spot-on. You would think that by then, since the Nintendo 64 and Playstation systems were out (Oh, and Saturn), the monochrome graphics and sounds would be weak by the years' standards, but nope (And the Game Boy Color version has....color!).One unique aspect about Wario Land 2 is that you can't lose/gain lives, so it wouldn't be a frustrating experience for new players. However, there's no need to worry about the difficulty, as the challenge is still there, and going strong enough to be fair for everyone.The level designs have a very interesting variety of platforms and enemies, as well as some neat decorations. The game never seems to grow pretty boring at all. And along with all of the bashing, throwing, pouncing, etc you could do, there are also a few puzzle elements thrown in certain levels /:-)Overall, this is an amazing Game Boy experience, and like all the Nintendo greats out there, it remains timeless to this day.

Everybody loves a good brain teasing puzzle game. What makes the puzzle game even better is when it's on a handheld system like the Game Boy or the Game Gear. Along with Tetris, Flipull, Puzzle League, etc, Bust-A-Move joins in with it's unique puzzling gameplay on the go. Previously released in arcades, the Playstation, and the Dreamcast, Bust-A-Move 4 is no different from its predecessors, and that's not a bad thing.Puzzle Mode has you go advance through lots and lots of puzzles, but with an end. In Normal and Expert difficulties, there is a letter pyramid. You start at letter A, having to go all the way to Z or Y. In each letter, you must complete a number of puzzles. In Easy mode, there are only 5 puzzles.You know the basic gameplay: Shoot colored bubbles into others with the same color. Match them to pop them, and the ones below will drop, too. This addicting premise will keep lots of players hooked as it did for me. It is a clever twist on Bubble Bobble's bubble-shooting platforming gameplay (In case if you didn't already know, the Bust-A-Move series is a spin-off series of Bubble Bobble).You can also play against a CPU in a Vs Mode. The matches are only sometimes challenging, though, so I'd say this is the weak point of the game.Challenge Mode is kind of like Puzzle Mode, except that this is just for a high score, although it does have your character travel in numbers 1-5, similarly to the letter pyramid. Even if you lose, however, you still move on. That's how you can tell it's based on scoring rather than progression.All of these modes are very fun to play (Even the CPU Vs Mode, in a way). Even if you think they wouldn't differ much from each other, that doesn't mean that Bust-A-Move 4 isn't a must-have. After all, it's an extremely addicting puzzle game. If you never owned a handheld version of a Bust-A-Move game, this is one to buy.

Right off the bat, I must tell you now. I am not really a huge fan of Batman. Never watched any movies or the shows. However, I played a couple of the NES games.Batman Forever was based off of a movie, but the game is actually fairly good. Unfortunately, there are flaws.As soon as you start playing the game, you'll realize that it is kind of a rebuilt Mortal Kombat. It has the same control scheme and the game is even made by Acclaim. It you like Mortal Kombat games, then this might be good news for you. Although it shares the controls with Mortal Kombat, there are, of course, new additions, such as the grappling hook and the Batarang. The grappling hook might take some getting used to.What has me dock a star off this review is that the challenge feels cheap at times. There is a way or two how more than half your health will drain from an enemy using their attack (Not the standard fighting moves). Everything else is great.If you are playing with a 3-button controller, you must press B and C (at the same time) + Up to shoot up. If you press all buttons at the same time, you just jump. And as for jumping down a hole, you must press C + Down. If you're using a 6-button controller, then you just need to use the Y button for the grappling hook instead of B and C. At least it isn't as terrible how the Super Nintendo version had it (Select + Up...Down + R)The graphics are really amazing for a Genesis game. Digitizing the actors...just like Mortal Kombat. The backgrounds are also dark and stylish. To think that Batman Forever would've actually made itself at home on the Sega 32x.The sound effects are also pretty cool, although you'd hear smacks and punches most of the time. And sometimes, you might not understand what the voice is saying when you collect a riddle (We could blame Genesis hardware for that, maybe).The most frustrating aspect of this game is the fact that there isn't a save feature. Now, there are video games in which you don't even need to save your game. But here, it's pretty lengthy. Plus, the game gets kinda hard at times.What's really awesome about this game is how you can play with another player in a co-op mode (Co-op Mortal Kombat, eh?). However, that might make the game kinda harder.There's also a Training mode. This mode has you beat up enemies until you die. Just keep progressing through difficulty levels, beating up punks. You can play as any character you want here. Even all the enemies (Pick the guy with the flamethrower) and Two-Face. This could just be a Genesis game itself, considering how some popular Genesis games don't have this mode. You can also play with a friend HERE, which is where things get really fun.Also in Training Mode, you can battle your friend. This is where it's just Mortal Kombat: Batman Edition all the way!Overall, this is one kind of Batman game you should try out.

The Turok series is more well-known as a First-Person Shooter (FPS) series, but I may as well stick with the Game Boy games, which are classic 2D platformers.Turok 2 has it all: A rocking soundtrack that is some of the best the Game Boy has to offer, great-looking graphics, and awesomely hard gameplay! There is also a nice variety of levels (Like a jungle, city, cavern, mountain, etc) and collectible items, such as a multidirectional gun that you can shoot enemies with.The game might seem like a beat 'em up at first glance, but of course, it's not. The first level has you roam a city, attacking mutants. But once you turn into a shirtless swordsman, you have to kill them all to move on the fully-platform-orientated levels.While the game is very fun, it's difficult, mainly because you actually take a good amount of damage from touching an enemy (Around 12 HP). Sure, there are medkits that help you take less damage, but there are also no checkpoints. I'm going to guess that's why you start with 10 lives. And plus, if you enter in a password save, it doesn't revive your lives.But flaws aside, this is a remarkable game that shouldn't be too looked down upon. And for $4 bucks, how can you go wrong?

If you enjoyed the first Sonic, you'll get a major kick out of its sequel. While we all know we get to play as Sonic, there's a new kid in town, and he helps Sonic in his second outing. Tails is supposed to be Sonic's sidekick. Characters aside, let's talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is identical to Sonic 1's, but with several differences going on in-game.1. The spin dash move is introduced2. 7 full zones with 3 1-act ones.3. Tails4. Different Special StagesThe special stages are entirely different from the first game. Now you must run through a halfpipe, collecting rings to get Chaos Emeralds. However, this is easier said than done. The sound and music are, once again, excellent. The graphics are also great, as they are an improvement of Sonic 1's.What's really great about this game is the multiplayer mode. While you do have to compete against the other player in finishing the levels first (or getting higher scores), you guys also have to beat those 4 multiplayer zones altogether!Overall, the game is awesome and challenging. This is the Sonic game all fans should get.UPDATE: I found out a really cool Easter egg. In 1-Player mode, someone can actually control Tails as the second player! This is pretty much the closest thing to a 2-Player co-op mode. Although Sonic still hogs the camera, your friend can help collect rings, defeat the bosses, get rings in special stages, and he/she can just plain goof off. After all, Tails IS invincible, so he won't lose rings or lives for Sonic.

Yoshi's Island was a huge hit in the mid-90s. The Nintendo 64 follow-up, however, isn't living up to it. It uses 2D graphics all around without any 3D models to be seen other than the pop-up book (Which is where the game takes place in, by the way) and what it's lying on.The main game is a 2D side-scroller in which you must go and eat as much fruit as possible. If you eat enough fruit, you move on to the next level. There are only 6 levels, though, so that said, you can beat the game in under an hour. That doesn't necessarily mean the whole game is bad, though. After all, the gameplay is very intriguing.However, the game is leaning over to the childish side, given the fact that the intermission and title screen music are grin-inducing for older people, since Yoshis were heard singing. The difficulty isn't steep, either. You can whop through the game pretty easily. Although, I would still recommend this game to you. That is, if you can look past the kiddy parts of the game.On the outside is a childish kind of package. On the inside is a unique platformer.

Wave Race is a childhood classic. From the memorable soundtrack to the fun of its gameplay mechanics to really great graphics, there's no doubt that one could have a lot of fun playing this game.It may consist of a handful of tracks, but you get to unlock some if you play a harder difficulty mode, in a similar fashion to how the Mario Kart series handles unlockables. Plus, the tracks themselves are actually thought out well and are fun to race in (Don't believe me? Watch some gameplay videos). For something that's supposed to look realistic, the courses are pretty imaginative.Really, one of the major things that make this game stand out from other racing games is how there are symbols floating on the water, telling you which direction you must go relative to it to avoid "Misses". If you collect enough "misses", you immediately lose. It's simple, but it works much better than it may sound.

Remember how revolutionary PItfall was back in 1982? Well, even if you don't remember, let alone live in the times, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a great action game that may please certain fans, depending on whether they were looking for something faithful or not.You play as Pitfall Harry Jr., who sets out to look for his dad through ancient buildings and jungles. This isn't any Pitfall game, though. It is an action game with throwing small objects (rocks?) and bombs, and whipping your foes as you go find an exit that leads to the next level. This calls for awesome battles with bosses and a solid platforming experience.The first level has you go through a jungle. The enemies here are just animals that you may normally see. You can bounce on spider webs like a trampoline, and you can also swing on vines (like original Pitfall). The boss is a tiger, but it can't be killed easily. You gotta throw some bombs and shoot at it. What's annoying here is how you must jump over its pattern as it dashes across the screen. If you jump too early or late, you'd be knocked down on the ground (Not saying you'd lose all your health that fast).That's one thing to think about this game. There are parts where some things can be difficult to jump over, such as that one giant boulder in a later pyramid level. You have to jump straight over it. There are also some things that you must figure out by toying around with the nearest buttons and switches you find.In the third level, there is a hidden area where you can play the original Pitfall game that was originally released on the Atari 2600! This really adds great appeal to nostalgia fans. The game is emulated perfectly, without any flaws or glitches whatsoever. However, when you get a Game Over, the game takes you back to the room where you found the portal that lets you play it.The graphics in the game are thoroughly detailed and nice. The sounds and music are greatly composed as well.The ending is one of the funniest video game endings ever. As you see Pitfall Harry Jr. find his dad, the game reveals that Pitfall Harry himself is the exact same as how he was in the original Atari 2600 game! Then he says "What took you so long?".Overall, this is a classic you should buy.

Super Mario World is the best Mario game of all time, and with great reason: Although people prefer Mario 3 over World, SMW fixed what we had to complain about in 3. The game continued on to become the best-selling 16-bit game.Super Mario 3 is great, but Mario World improved some faults and added better things that made this game more superior:-Yoshi-Cape power-up-Saving/Loading-Less auto-scrolling levels-etcThe game lasts really long, and it is always fun, even after it is beaten.

To rival Street Fighter II and its success, this game comes out and starts up a huge controversial topic about violence in video games. When it was ported to consoles, several versions didn't have the gore. The Super Nintendo game was one of them. WHAT?! You dare criticize an awesome fighting game just because there wasn't blood?! What greed.The gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting. You can choose from a number of fighters (I choose Sub-Zero), and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter. Eventually, you'll get to the Endurance rounds, which let you face against the defeated fighters, but you must face 2 under one go. That is what makes the game stand out.The graphics are as great and faithful to the original arcade version's.I can say the same for the sound and music quality.Overall, it's a really good fighting game that shouldn't be ignored. Even without the blood.

Space Invaders certainly is a fun arcade classic (To think it came all the way from the late 70s), and it clearly shows that through its simplistic, yet enjoyable gameplay. A 2-Player Vs Mode to see who can kill the aliens faster is a nice addition to the faithful adaptation.But you see - The main problem that prevents this from getting 5 stars isn't the game's own fault. It's that there are so many other shooters on the Super Nintendo, let alone the other systems, that go beyond the heights of this game. I gave the Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders 5 stars due to its brand-new game modes that make the game itself more fresh and fun.Take even the most similar games in the lot, like Galaga. It's gameplay is identical to that of Space Invaders, but it allows the player to shoot multiple missles at once, and the aliens dive toward the player's aircraft. Space Invaders has a slightly duller feel compared to Galaga.However, if you're a Space Invaders fan, this Super Nintendo version won't disappoint, as it is just like the arcade original. Just try not to expect a major improvement.

The Game Boy was a gloriously fantastic handheld back in the day. Things couldn't have been better for Nintendo....until 1998. That's when things went up a notch for the Game Boy line. People don't want light. People don't want thin copies of the system....okay maybe they still wanna fit it in their pockets, but what the people were asking for...is color.The Game Boy Color lets you play all of your Game Boy favorites in random color, but it also opens the door into a new colorful library of games! The Game Boy Color has continued the life span of the original system to 2002.It also saves batteries, as it uses half the amount of batteries the Game Boy uses.

You'd probably mistake this as just another regular cartridge port of Ms. Pac-Man, but if you did, then you couldn't be more wrong.The sounds try to emulate the arcade's sounds.The graphics do the same thing.Now, for the gameplay, there's a lot to talk about. Right after the title screen, there's tons of options to choose from:-Players: 1, 2 (Co-op), 2 (Competitive), 2 (Alternative)-Difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard, Crazy-Pac-Booster: On, off (I ALWAYS choose On for this one. What can beat fast Ms. Pac-Man?)-Maze Selection (My favorite option): Arcade, Mini, Big, StrangeYou can alter the game with all of those options! The main gameplay is pure Ms. Pac-Man awesomeness.You can't beat that!Unfortunately, this game has been overlooked due to the fact that this version was released the same year as the Nintendo 64.The NES (Tengen), SNES, and Genesis versions of this game are the best versions you can find.

Who would've guessed that Pac-Man World would be heading to a different direction? What's confusing is that this game, which has darker environments, talking characters, a new set of attacks (Although old moves are back), etc, is billed as a sequel.Underneath all that is different, though, the Pac-Man World feel is somewhat there. But despite the quiet change, Pac-Man World 3 remains to be a very fun game. You still have Pac-Man's Butt-Bounce and Rev Roll moves from the past two games, but now you can punch, and perform combos with the Butt-Bounce. There are also different kinds of Power Pellets that give you a certain power. Oh, yes. And you can Wall Jump.The environments, while they aren't as colorful as the previous installments, are still fun to romp through and their graphics are hugely detailed! The collectible fruits and Galaxians for bonus Pac-Man mazes are still present, but now there are also Anniversary statues and cards (The latter of which lets you view pictures of the game's characters and levels). The levels are also HUGE compared to the previous games. The only problem is that there are some instances where you must go back and forth, looking for something, to progress forward, but only some.The game's Museum section contains a nice view of Pac-Man stuff, such as a brief timeline of the years Pac-Man games were released in (Strangely, even Professor Pac-Man is on the list), an interview with the creator of Pac-Man, and, of course, the original Pac-Man arcade game. I wish there were more arcade games like in Pac-Man World 2, but since there are Namco Museum collections on the Gamecube with lots of classics, I suppose that it's not really too big of an issue.I absolutely love the game's dialogue. Sure, the previous games didn't involve talking characters, but (1) Pac-Man has the PERFECT voice actor here, and (2) the dialogue is charming and actually funny. The characters would even reference Pac-Man World 1 a few times ("At least this birthday's still better than my 20th..")! Speaking of which, Orson (The ghost that controlled Toc-Man) reappears, but helps out Pac-Man throughout the adventure, giving him info about everything, as well as go off into certain conversations. He builds another Toc-Man machine, but Pac-Man could control it. The little amount of Toc-Man stages aren't as fun as PMW2's submarine level(s) or PMW1's King Galaxian boss battle, but at least the rest of the game is great.Did I forget to mention that you could play as Pinky and Clyde? You find them later on in the game. Pinky could help solidify platforms Pac-Man can't normally see, and Clyde could zap enemies with...swirly beams, I guess. He could also perform a giant "Scare" that knocks over tall structures that have big crystals. They are pretty acceptable for a new temporary change of gameplay.Overall, this is a pretty amazing game that should not be missed. It may not reach the heights of the first two games, but it's certainly a fine game in its own right. Also, it could be worth it just to hear Pac-Man talk. With an awesome voice. And crack up some good jokes.

Pac-Man Collection is a compilation of four incredibly awesome Pac-Man games. The games are:Pac-Man: Play the original arcade hit that started it all! You should know what this classic is like by now.Pac-Mania: A fake 3D take on the original, in which there are new mazes and worlds.Pac-Attack: A cool spin off of Tetris. Every 3 blocks Pac-Man drops, and then he would eat any ghost in his path.Pac-Man Arrangement (HIGHLIGHT OF THIS CARTRIDGE): The best arcade Pac-Man game yet! 5 worlds with nonstop munchin' fun!So I'm pretty sure all fans would get a kick out of this collection. With these titles, what can go wrong for you in the fun factor?

Nintendo has always been a fighter. The Game Boy and Sega's Game Gear have duked it out for quite some time. However, SNK seemed to notice something: The Game Gear's library of games lacks the oomph the Game Boy does. That said, it was time for PORTABLE NEO GEO ACTION!!The Neo Geo Pocket Color couldn't have had more potential. The system looked dang AWESOME! Look at the 16-Bit-esc graphics! Listen to that sound chip! And then came the games...The game library certainly looked awesome at first. After all, we've got handheld Fatal Fury, Metal Slug, Pac-Man in color, and even Sonic the Hedgehog joined in the party! The titles were certainly too good to be true, but they were! This convinced customers that the Game Boy was having serious competition for the first time.That was, until later years. All of those games we saw...were all we were getting. The Neo Geo Pocket Color died in just 2 years, leaving us with a rather lopsided library. Heck, even the Japan-only games still result in a small overall library. And because of that, there are very few games of certain genres (Metal Slug and Sonic being the only platformers I know on it).But that does not mean the Pocket Color is a bad system. The games that we do have on here are EXCELLENT! Want to see the exclusive adventures players experience on only this handheld? BUY THE SYSTEM!!!

Retro Atari Classics is simple and to the point - It's a compilation of 10 arcade games made by Atari (Who else?). The majority of the games are fun and they hold up pretty well this day and age. However, there are a few clunkers. I've played each game, and here are my statements about them.Asteroids: This space shooter is so darn addicting!Missle Command: Honestly, I used to really hate this one. Fortunately, the touch screen really helps make the game playable/fun.Centipede: Just as great of a classic as Asteroids!Pong: Can I really criticize Pong? It is a classic, and it always will be (Although, I will admit - It was a bit weird seeing the game in a vertical view)Warlords: It's like a hugely modified twist on Pong. You hit the ball against other people's castles to destroy bits and pieces of them. It's a remarkably fun twist, actually.Breakout: The game has aged horribly. The block busting isn't really that fun since there's...like...a hundred blocks on just one screen, and there's nothing that can help you destroy all that except if you have enough patience (which I highly doubt). Plus, the ball physics are sometimes screwy.Sprint: I wanted to like this one. I really mean it. However, the problem with this early racer is that if you slip on oil or collide with a car, you instantly head straight into a wall. Lots of frustration here.Gravitar: A really interesting one here, actually. It's like an adventure version of Asteroids in a way. Not bad, not bad.Lunar Lander: I just don't like this one...Tempest: Another great shooter! The pseudo-3D gimmick is pretty impressive, considering its age, and it's very addicting!Overall, I give this collection a thumbs up. However, let me simply say I hate the collection's "Remix" editions. They're just like the originals, but with crappier sprites. Play the originals, and you'll have a great time with this DS cartridge!

Pac-Man World was one of the main reasons why one should buy a Playstation (1 or 2). It had unique gameplay that wasn't really performed by any other platformer. It was also meant to celebrate the yellow muncher's 20th anniversary. Five years later, Nintendo players finally get a taste of the game as it was ported onto the handheld Game Boy Advance.Now, right off the bat, I'd feel like I'm overrating the game. There were so many levels missing from the Playstation original. The mazes and the Pac-Man arcade game (Actually, why should you care about that if Pac-Man has been ported to every system known to man?) were also gone. This is probably where you'd start asking why I would recommend this game if several things are missing. Well, the game is still fun and I really enjoy playing it.Still images that are kinda animated replace the CGI cutscenes of the original, probably due to the limited cartridge space (Then again, think about the Game Boy Advance Video series). There are 12 levels in the game. I understand the GBA has limits, but I find this to be a bit ridiculous. The system isn't THAT limited...The graphics are pretty impressive. However, you might jump to a platform and miss. Not because of a glitch, but because you aren't in the same distance as the platform. That can confuse a person at times, but at least you'll get the hang of it afterward.The sound is great too, but the music isn't as extended as in the original game, so there might be a rhythm or two missing.The gameplay is obviously the best part of the entire game. It is completely identical to the Playstation game. The butt-bouncing, Pac-dot explosions, and fruit doors are all there. Beware: In case if you are cautious about what will happen when you go to a certain area, or where you will fall, try to wander around first. The difficulty is almost lacking, so it sorta makes a nice lazy day-type game, although things will get harder in later levels. Speaking of levels, the game is non-linear, meaning you can select which level to go to, with the exception of some locked levels. If a level is locked, you must beat the one shown before it to unlock it.There are 12 levels in this version of the game.Those levels are: Buccaneer Beach, Corsair's Cove, Crazy Cannonade, Crisis Cavern, Manic Mines, Space Race, Far Out, Clowning Around, Barrel Blast, Creepy Catacombs, Grave Danger, and Toc-Man Lair.To unlock...Manic Mines: Beat Crisis CavernFar Out: Beat Space RaceClowning Around, Creepy Catacombs: Beat the first 7 levelsBarrel Blast: Beat Clowning AroundGrave Danger: Beat Creepy CatacombsToc-Man Lair: Beat everything else (?)You know....this version, Ducktales, and Super Mario Land all seem to show that even the shortest game can succeed. Heck, even Star Fox walked through that door before.The game is just really fun all around. It's a port of a great Playstation game (Although not everything from the original's included), and it's portable. It may not be a perfect game, but it's really fun. If you don't happen to own a Playstation, you might as well go get this for your Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Player (add-on for Nintendo Gamecube), Micro, Nintendo DS, or DS Lite, if you have one of those. Heck, even if you own a Playstation, the portability of this version keeps you playing.

Why is it that everybody in the movie industry back then relied on LJN? LJN always makes some of the worst NES games out there, yet it gets to make those games based off of only so many movies out there. Jaws is one of them.You play as a diver in which you go look for Jaw- Wait, scratch that. You actually have to power up the diver by collecting shells during underwater battles with stingrays and jellyfish (Really??). Every once in a while, a shark would come, but it's not Jaws. After getting your much-needed shells, you sail over to a dock to exchange your shells for leveling up.However, you first get a device that can track down Jaws. Really, you are just going back and forth, dock to dock, to level up your character to fight the iconic shark. You see, Jaws doesn't take damage easily. If you're at a high enough power level, you can kill him easier.Also every once in a while, you get into a bonus stage in which you bomb jellyfish using a place to collect bonus shells.Now is where I actually review this stuff...So, while the whole premise with shooting enemy stingrays and jellyfish is sorta entertaining, there isn't much in level design. The stingrays always cross either left or right, and the jellyfish just pop out of the ground. That's about it.Plus, just the pure concept of you having to kill stingrays and jellyfish is just weird. Heck, why is the diver BOMBING jellyfish with a plane?!One other major complaint I have with the game is that if you lose a life, you also lose a power level. Therefore, you have to collect more shells than before just to regain the power level. I just hate that.It may have dull and questionable design choices, but it can still appeal to some shooter fans or those who just want to play a simple NES game.

It's nice to see Namco hold a 50th Anniversary celebration for the company, but the celebration is only one to participate in if you had bought the console version of this particular release of Namco Museum, which contained 14 games. If you bought this Game Boy Advance version, you'd be left out of the party easily.So what does this offering of Namco Museum bring you? Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Rally-X, Galaga, and Dig Dug. They are all great, great arcade games. I don't dislike any one of them. But you see, this collection falls flat due to the fact that there are lots of better offers for the Game Boy Advance. In fact, you can just buy the regular Namco Museum and Pac-Man Collection on the same system (See my reviews for both of those collections), and leave this release alone...unless you're dying to play Rally-X on the go.

Like the Master System/Game Gear games that succeeded it, Sonic Chaos features all of the high-speed fast-paced action you would always expect from a good Sonic game, as well as short levels, though.The level design is interesting, but normally, I'd beat an act in under a minute. The graphics are also neatly detailed and not bad to look at. The sounds and music are good, but the music isn't memorable. Strangely, that also seems to go for Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic Blast (two of the games that succeeded this).What I find to be pretty cool are the item boxes that contain springs. As shown on the boxart, it's like bouncing as high as Mario with a pogo stick.This game is a forgotten Sonic classic that deserves more attention. Heck, pretty much all of Sonic Game Gear games need as much attention. This game is as good as any 2D Sonic game out there.

Okay, I get it. There's no expecting high-speed action in this platformer. But what you CAN expect is anything else. In this pseudo-3D Genesis classic, you must defeat badniks to rescue Flickies. Then, when you have all of them, you could advance to the next part of the level, if not another level. Basically, it's like the Flicky arcade game, except with Sonic and fake 3D.The levels certainly aren't going to be short, but you'd have a fun time exploring while finding enemies to kill. After all, the environments are very colorful and detailed, and there's a good variety of obstacles to be found within areas, just like the average Genesis Sonic game. Oh, and the soundtrack rocks.The Special Stages in this game are similar to Sonic 2's (Collect rings - Avoid bombs) but are way easier in comparison. You can even play inside 2 during one level, since you can go find Tails and Knuckles in every one, who take you to said Special Stages.I would have given this game just 4 stars for the lack of a save feature, but since you can actually CAN save your progress in this Steam version, unlike the Sega Saturn or Genesis versions, this gets an extra star.Overall, this is another great Sonic game that shouldn't be missed, even if there's a lack of speed to be noticed.

Now that Rayman 3D (another version of this game) is coming, I might as well go ahead and review this Nintendo 64 version. Well, Rayman 2 has been released in numerous game systems, such as the PC, the Playstation, the Dreamcast, the Nintendo DS, you know, to name a few. I can see why: This game is so good that it can't be missed.The game tells about an evil pirate named Razorbeard who plans to capture everybody as slaves, including Rayman himself and his best pal, Globox. Most of the time, I welcome the cutscenes, mainly because of how funny and/or dramatic they are, especially the part where Rayman meets the Teensies. When he meets them, the king says "Congratulations, Rayman! As King of the Teensies-", and then a fellow Teensie butts in and tells Rayman that HE'S the king. And then the 4 Teensies all fight about who's king. It's funny when you watch the scene. Another hilarious scene is when Razorbeard eats a Lum. Now, there are 1000 Lums existing in the game. There are kinda like coins from the Mario series. Here, as Razorbeard eats one, the HUD actually drops the total of Lums from 1000 to 999! That cracked me up very much.The gameplay is obviously the very best part of the game. It is what makes the game what it is. Here, you can throw white stuff (Not sure what it actually is) at the enemies to kill them. You can also hold down Z to get into a combat position to make the fighting easier. There are also breaking open cages and collecting Lums, as well as sliding down waterfalls and falling from huge heights.The graphics are gorgeously detailed for a Nintendo 64 game. At the time, I bet most of these textures looked real, while the characters came from some kind of 3D-animated movie. The cutscenes are also well-programmed. You can tell what actions the characters would do neatly.The music and sound effects are also greatly composed. They are in great quality as you hear smacks coming from you beating up the enemy pirate or some kind of boss. The characters don't really speak English, or any known language for that matter, but I assume it's some kind of made-up language translated below each cutscene.Overall, this is a great N64 gem. It's a must-have. If you can't get this for your Nintendo 64, then get it for the Dreamcast. Heck, get it for any system you can find it released for! Except the DS version, because it isn't as good.

The original Rayman is perhaps one of the finest platformers that ever came out. There's a reason why this game has been re-released for some times (Not as much as Rayman 2, but still). That reason is...everything.The game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in a video game. I can tell there were LOTS of effort put into this masterpiece. You can even put the game into a CD player and it would play the music!Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP&lt; being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Playstation lying around.

Rayman is FUN! The original Playstation game featured fabulous graphics and gameplay alike. Rayman is more than just an average platformer. Rayman introduces cool play mechanics that will keep you playing. Rayman actually THROWS his FISTS at his enemies! He also swings across purple hoop-shaped Lums.This limbless wonder has everything that makes a great platformer....great. But all that was on the Playstation, the Jaguar, the Saturn, and the PC. How does the awesomism hold up on the Game Boy Color, an 8-Bit handheld?Well, when you boot up the game, you get the BEST 10 SECONDS EVER ON GAME BOY COLOR! I mean, seriously! It's pre-rendered 3D animation that looks like a cartoon-y CGI-movie intro! Only the Rayman games have done this on Game Boy Color!Now for the main game.The game is actually very good. Although the levels are different, the basic gameplay is the same and is already very fun to play with. You can still hover with Rayman's hair , throw his fists, and swing across purple Lums, just like in the original game. But also like the original, you get these powers later on. What isn't like the original, however, is the entire setting. Sure, the story is faithful, but the worlds and levels are NOT from the original game. Instead, the game is made up of all of these new unfamiliar worlds that will get your Rayman juices pumping.Note that the music is actually from Rayman 2. I understand that the Game Boy Color game was released after Rayman 2 was created for the Nintendo 64, Playstation, and Dreamcast.....but why does this Rayman have to use Rayman 2's soundtrack? And, of course, the tunes are in 8-Bit, but they're still somewhat nice to listen to.The graphics are still very shockingly amazing to look at. It seems like as if Ubisoft put in a bunch of effort just to animate Rayman himself correctly. The environments and everything else are just as gorgeous.So overall, this is a great game, even on the 8-Bit Game Boy Color, and I suggest you should purchase this. Even you already own another version of Rayman, this is worth it for the new worlds and levels you can play in.

I can see why: This game is so good that it can't be missed.The game tells about an evil pirate named Razorbeard who plans to capture everybody as slaves, including Rayman himself and his best pal, Globox. Most of the time, I welcome the cutscenes, mainly because of how funny and/or dramatic they are, especially the part where Rayman meets the Teensies. When he meets them, the king says "Congratulations, Rayman! As King of the Teensies-", and then a fellow Teensie butts in and tells Rayman that HE'S the king. And then the 4 Teensies all fight about who's king. It's funny when you watch the scene. Another hilarious scene is when Razorbeard eats a Lum. Now, there are 1000 Lums existing in the game. There are kinda like coins from the Mario series. Here, as Razorbeard eats one, the HUD actually drops the total of Lums from 1000 to 999! That cracked me up very much.The gameplay is obviously the very best part of the game. It is what makes the game what it is. Here, you can throw white stuff (Not sure what it actually is) at the enemies to kill them. You can also hold down Z to get into a combat position to make the fighting easier. There are also breaking open cages and collecting Lums, as well as sliding down waterfalls and falling from huge heights. One major addition that's exclusive to this version of the game shocked me by a lot. If you were to complete the game with at least 90% and 800 lums, wait for the credits to end and then you'll be playing an old beta version of the game!Rayman 2 was originally going to be 2D, like the first game. The beta has pretty much the exact same graphics and gameplay as the first game. It reminds me of the later-released Game Boy Color version, which also plays and looks like the first Rayman game. This is a very interesting beta, and to think that it's actually available for play.The graphics are gorgeously detailed for a Playstation game. At the time, I bet most of these textures looked real, while the characters came from some kind of 3D-animated movie. The cutscenes are also well-programmed. You can tell what actions the characters would do neatly.The music and sound effects are also greatly composed. They are in great quality as you hear smacks coming from you beating up the enemy pirate or some kind of boss. The characters don't really speak English, or any known language for that matter, but I assume it's some kind of made-up language translated below each cutscene.Overall, this is a great gem. It's a must-have. If you can't get this for your Playstation, then get it for the Dreamcast. Heck, get it for any system you can find it released for! Except the DS version, because it isn't as good.

Toy Story was an awesome movie. However, is it an awesome cash-in? Actually, the game's pretty good. As Woody, you go through 18 levels that relate to the movie and follow its storyline.Since this version of the game was released after the SNES game, there are some differences that were put in the game.Some of these are:-New level-Bonus game-Level differencesThe graphics are some of the best on the Genesis. Especially considering its limited color palliate.The sounds and music aren't as great as the Super Nintendo had them turn out, also considering the limits, but they are still sounding pretty well on the hardware.The gameplay is also pretty good, but it's always varied, although it's mostly a platform game.However, the game is hard. Harder than the Super Nintendo game. The reason why and how is because of the new additions to some levels. The Claw has this annoying wire that hits you when you touch it. Really Inside the Claw Machine is an entirely different and more confusing maze. Nightmare Buzz moves slowly. And the list goes on. Things are still easier after beating it once, though.The storyline is horribly written in the game. For example: "I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going!" However, you'd just skip the storyline cutscenes anyway. What? We've all done it.But overall, this is a good game for the Genesis library that you should probably own. Unless if you have a more superior version of the game, or at least, what you think is superior.

Nintendo was about to go bankrupt, but then Miyamoto was tasked to create an arcade game. That arcade game is Donkey Kong. It became as big as Pac-Man (Okay, maybe not as big) and lived up to even today. The Atari 2600 port was a good game. There was one major flaw though: 2 levels are missing. So you only get to play through 2 levels.However, the game is still kinda fun to play.....But having to play only half the game just doesnt work for me that much.

Game & Watch Gallery 4 may say "Six Games in One" one the box, but don't be fooled by that. You may have started out with 6 Game & Watch games, but as you earn more stars, you unlock more! You start out with these titles:Fire: Don't let the helpless victims fall on the ground as they have escaped from the fire burning in the castle.Boxing: KO the computer player(s).Rain Shower: Don't let anything drop on Mario's friends (In Classic mode, don't let rain drop on the drying clothes).Mario's Cement Factory: Turn the cement into cookies for Yoshi to eat or for Toad to package. (In Classic Mode: For customers' cars)Donkey Kong Jr: Faithful to the arcade classic, you must grab the key and rescue Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong 3: Blow bubbles (Classic: Bug spray) at the fireballs and ghosts (Classic: Bugs) so they can harm your opponent.You are already thrilled with the games, but as you unlock more games, you get another bunch of Game & Watch classics:Chef: Juggle the food in the air without dropping them on the floor.Mario Bros: Carry cakes (Classic: Boxes) into the conveyor belts to decorate it (Classic: Inserting bottles into the boxes). Fill up the truck with the packages for extra points.Donkey Kong: Another classic arcade game that pits you against the gorilla while having to save Peach (Classic: Pauline).Octopus: Go underwater and nab treasures from the octopus.Fire Attack: Whack the enemies with your hammer and don't let them torch or blow up your base.Die-hard Game & Watch fans should be in heaven by now, but now there are 9 more games! Yeah! NINE! But they have no Modern versions, though. The games are:Manhole: Don't let people fall into the water and make bridges for them to cross over.Tropical Fish: Like Fire, you must bounce them over to the other fish tank, but you must not let the fish fall on the floor.Mario's Bombs Away: The only game where Mario's in the military (and where you see someone smoking in a Mario game), you must carry the bomb over to a fellow soldier to throw at the enemy's army, while avoiding to have it lit.Parachute: Catch the falling parachutists.Bombsweeper: As you go through a maze, you must find the bomb and don't let it blow up.Climber: The best Game & Watch platformer besides Super Mario Bros, you must climb up mountains as high as possible.Safe Buster: Catch the falling bombs and throw them into the fire.Lifeboat: Catch the falling people and guide them to safety.Zelda: Yeah, that's right. The final unlockable game is a Game & Watch version of ZELDA! You must attack your enemies until their health fades to 0. If you have 5 hearts, you can shoot lasers out of your sword. You can also find a Tomahawk to use against the boss to kill it faster, and a map in case if you want to go to the boss with less battles along the way. Life Water can heal you fully to 5 hearts.You can also play multiplayer in Boxing and Donkey Kong 3 using the link cable.All of these Game & Watch classics are seriously addicting, and the fun just doesn't stop when it comes to having 20 Game & Watch games on your Game Boy Advance!So overall, this is one heck of a GBA cartridge,

Toy Story was an awesome movie. However, is it an awesome cash-in? Actually, the game's pretty good. As Woody, you go through 17 levels that relate to the movie and follow its storyline.The graphics are as fantastic as its previous Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo counterparts.The sounds are just as amazing.The music is incredible. It improved HUGELY upon the previous versions' tunes. In fact, if you don't have VirtualPC or a Windows '95, you can just buy this disc just to get the soundtrack!The gameplay is also pretty good, but it's always varied, although it's mostly a platform game. Unlike the SNES and Genesis games, the Really Inside the Claw Machine level has been removed and the Genesis level "Day Toy Na" has been added.However, the game is hard. Although things are easier after beating it once. Thankfully, you can save your game. That is a great inclusion.The storyline is horribly written in the game. For example: "I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going!" However, you'd just skip the storyline cutscenes anyway. What? We've all done it.But overall, this is a great game for the PC library that you should probably own. If you don't like how it can't play on newer computers, try and download VirtualPC so you can play it on an emulated version of the Windows '95 computer.

Rayman has always been Ubisoft's best mascot. He's been in games that have been considered some of the greatest platformers of all time (Rayman 2). While Rayman has still been moving around in 3D games, he still ventures through 2D platformers on handheld releases, such as Rayman 3 and Hoodlum's Revenge for Game Boy Advance. Also over the past few years, the Rabbids came and, according to some Rayman fans, stole the show. While the Rabbids games were funny at first, the humor began to grow stale later on. So how does this Game Boy Advance version of the first Rabbids game hold up?Well, as soon as you press Start on the title screen, you hear the Rabbid's famous scream as he shakes back and forth rapidly. I cracked up there, but that was really a false impression. There isn't really any humor elsewhere in the game, other than the final boss, in which you hear the scream again every time you hit the boss. The game was supposed to be a not-so-hilarious-but-fun platform game, anyway, so this is only a minor complaint.As Rayman, you advance through levels in a traditional 2D Rayman platformer. It's very easy at first, but of course, the challenges pop up later on. It is pretty fun, like all Rayman platformers out there. There are also some cool new features, such as the ability to switch into different goofy-looking costumes for special powers. There are also some bonus levels that differ in one of these three gameplay types: Platforming, fake 3D racing, or shooting gallery.The bosses, once you know what to do (And you WILL know what to do) are very easy to beat (except for the final boss). All you have to do is wait as the boss to keep trying to hit you until the boss exposes himself so you can be able to attack. Actually, to think of it, It's the same boss character over and over again. The only different boss is, again, the final boss, in which it's a Mecha Rabbid.The game is actually shorter than I expected (5 worlds), but it still manages to be as fun as other Rayman games. The ending is also very stupid and rushed (There isn't even a credits sequence), but you can easily ignore it.So overall, it's not a bad game, and it lives up to the other Rayman games very well. I would have liked it if the comedy from the console versions translated to this version, but if you can get past that flaw, you will have a neat 2D Rayman experience. This is also probably the best version of Raving Rabbids you can find, since it's your average 2D Rayman game.

Popeye is an arcade game based off of the old television cartoon show (which is still being watched on Boomerang, by the way). While the game didn't really grow as popular as games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, it was a cult classic.You play as Popeye, and you must catch whatever Olive throws down (Hearts, music notes, H E L P letters). Each level has Olive throwing down different things. Of course, there's also Bluto trying to get in your way. If you get close to him, it's likely that he will throw wine bottles at you. You gotta break them by punching them. If you get farther in the game, a witch would probably come and throw skulls at you, too.Each level has different gimmicks. The first has nothing, actually. The second level has a seesaw you can use to reach a platform unreachable by doing everything else. The third level shows Olive being captured by a bird. The bird is another obstacle which you can hurt by punching.Graphics and sounds are faithful to the arcade game.Overall, it's a great arcade game that fits in well with the NES.

The NES has one of the greatest game libraries of all time. Look into it once and you find titles like Mario, the port of Contra, Zelda, Metroid, Mega Mans 1-6, and so on. But who would have thought that there would be one classic whose atmosphere involves Dracula and similarly eerie scenery? That game is Castlevania. Before there were games like, say, Resident Evil, Castlevania was one game to capture a dark feel. And the game blended it in with top-notch gameplay, awesome music, and great graphics alike.The game is simple. It's a platformer in which the main character uses a whip to kill enemies. You eventually obtain certain items that are used in different ways than the whip (EX: A watch that freezes all enemies for a few seconds, and a tomahawk you can throw). The game's divided into 6 somewhat-big levels, and unlike modern Castlevania games, this original is linear throughout. But that's not a bad thing. It's a game that's straightforward and to the point, offering you the fun right away.However, you may as well be warned. If you haven't played this game, let me tell you this: It is HARD. There are lots of things to be aware about as you play the game (Especially how the enemies move). If you aren't careful, you could die pretty easily. Speaking of which, some deaths could occur from falling into bottomless pits, which most likely happen when an enemy knocks you in. Thankfully, there's a Continue option, so hope for beating this game isn't totally lost. Besides, this game is very fun, anyway, difficult or not. You should definitely try this classic out. Just be sure to expect a challenge.

I may not be a Pokemon fan anymore, but I LOVED the series when I was a lot younger (Fun Fact: A Jirachi card was what motivated me to ride my bike). Actually, I'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom. Now, let me tell you: I'm not one to troll Nintendo. I'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy, just so you know (See lots of my other reviews for proof).But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium, you'd probably think: "OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64!!!" It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever, considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy, right? WRONG.Pokemon Stadium isn't what you'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise. Rather than it being an RPG, the series's turn-based battles replace it all! It's all about fighting your Pokemon. Nothing else. In turned-based battles. How the heck is that supposed to work? It's not. If it's an RPG with that stuff, then we'd be all over it. You CAN'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself.Okay, maybe it actually isn't ALL about the turn-based battles. There are minigames, and some of them can be rather interesting. But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG. We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed. This should be left alone, as one of Nintendo's few pieces of crap. At least the graphics were amazing for the N64.

Stanley's first and only console game never lived up to the games his cousin had starred in, and with great reason: His game isn't nearly as fun as the previous games.The goal is simple. All you have to do is shoot up Donkey Kong's butt until he reaches the top of the vines he is climbing. Bugs will come down to distract you and take your flowers.All the levels have almost the same layout, with the exception of the enemies.Since it's arrived to the GBA, you might want to take a good look at the game. I mean, I sorta like the game. But it still isn't as fun as the other Mario games out there.

Around the time of space shooters like Galaxian and Space Invaders, Asteroids managed to stick out from them by utilizing one awesome gameplay twist: Controlling a multidirectional spaceship.That said, Asteroids is terrific. Shooting things has never been any more thrilling (at the time) thanks to the fabulous control over your ship. You can move anywhere you please, but it's not as simple as that; you gotta pull the brakes if you want to stop the ship. And your ship actually has to TURN to go the direction you want it to.Fortunately, that all made for a deeper experience, yet the overall game manages to be addicting as heck.

Why is Animaniacs not on TV anymore? Why don't big-name game companies make licensed titles anymore? We may not be able to answer these questions, but as long as we've got these excellent licensed 1990s games, then we may as well be happy.I remembered watching the Animaniacs movie, Wakko's Wish, a really long time ago...After I re-watched it again just recently, I went on to watch several episodes of the show, thus making me become an Animaniacs fan very quickly. So when I saw that there was a game for 90s consoles (Sega Genesis, SNES, Game Boy), I had to go and get the SNES version! That is, after watching 30 seconds of gameplay.Once booting it up, the game already seems promising. The title screen, Konami logo, etc, all has rich detail and the title's music is no disappointment. Then, once pressing Start, you get to see an awesomely funny intro cutscene! The scene shows Pinky and the Brain steal a movie script from Warner Bros. studios. What do ya know? Humor's easily shown! And then there's the Warners themselves making their appearances. They are told about the evil plot going on, and that the message will self-destruct in 1 second (Ha!).When playing the actual game, it's styled like a beat 'em up, but you don't actually beat..up anybody, although you can bounce on enemies' heads. Although the gameplay's very simple, it makes for exciting action! And on top of that, the graphics and sound are detailed, colorful, and amazing to look at. Plus, believe it or not, there's actually some slapstick funniness like in the show! For example, when encountering Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff, he jumps out of the window! And when venturing through the Adventure level, you'd knock over Buttons (the dog in the show that always ends up in harsh situations)!The game doesn't totally consist of running and jumping, though. There are segments that feature mine-cart riding, auto-scrolling, chase scenes, and more, of course. The segments really help add to the already fun gameplay, making the overall game even more fun (Although sorta frustrating, but see below).But as wonderful as the game is, it can be INCREDIBLY hard, due to you being able to die within one hit. Like many Konami games (Contra, I'm looking at you), Animaniacs consists of extreme difficulty. Thankfully, there's a slot machine gimmick that helps out very much. You see, coins are scattered throughout the levels. When collecting them, the slot machine is activated. If there's 3 panels of a certain character (Skippy, Chicken Boo, Hello Nurse, etc), then you receive a continue (Only for one of the Warners, though). If the panels range from Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, respectively, then you get to bring them back (In case if you died as one or two of them)!So...yeah. This game is great! Even if it IS hard, you can get through this via trial-and-error. Either way, I bet Super NES players will have a very fun time with this licensed gem.

When you think of the arcade, what's one game that can possibly come to mind? Frogger, right? Remember its addicting traffic-dodging gameplay? Its memorable tunes? It's retro graphics? How about its charm in general? Well, this Super Nintendo version has only half of what I asked to remember.It has the same addicting traffic-dodging gameplay that put Konami/Sega (Though Konami won in a legal battle) on the map and, while it doesn't have the same graphics as the original, it provides its own colorful graphics. You would think that it would probably be better than the original, but no.What sucks about this version is that it doesn't have the catchy music from the original. In fact, it doesn't have ANY music. Just wonky sound effects. Also, since the game has been revamped with updated graphics, the wonky sound effects, and no music, it just loses the charm that struck me as I played the arcade game.

Pac-Man is a really awesome arcade game. It's so addicting! You just eat dots while roaming around in a maze while avoiding ghosts. And then you could use a special dot in which the ghosts become edible. This, my friends, was timeless action the Namco loves going back to over and over again. Not in 1994, though, in which they release Pac-Man 2. Look at that cover art...I don't think this is maze game. I have a theory as to why this "interactive cartoon" has the Pac-Man 2 name. There was a Pac-Man cartoon show in the 80s. I can only assume this is a sequel to that. Since a new Pac-Man show is being made and set for next year, why not review Namco's attempt at doing something like that in a video game?Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures has you help Pac-Man on his journey. That's right. YOU'RE a part of his ventures. Anyway, the game is composed of various objectives Pac-Man has to accomplish. He roams around all kinds of places such as a farm, a warehouse, a mountain, and much more. The trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of what's going on around the scenery.The player uses a slingshot to shoot at stuff to get Pac-Man to notice them (You can also convince Pac-Man to look in a certain direction). It's like a shooting gallery crossed with an adventure game. However, since this is classified as an "interactive cartoon", there were definitely some bizarre reactions to what you shoot. For example, if you shoot a guy at a Hot Dog stand, he squirts ketchup onto Pac-Man in anger. Sometimes, the slingshot could be used to help Pac-Man find ways to progress (EX: A rope for him to climb, or shooting away a rock on a hill so Pac-Man doesn't trip over it). Or you can even shoot Pac-Man himself when he's about to meet his fate, so he could jump away (or you could just shoot him to anger him).The slingshot could also be used for slinging Power Pellets in case of any ghosts lurking around. However, here's one major flaw with that - The only place I recall where you get Power Pellets is Pac-Man's house. And you only get to use 3 before running out. If Pac-Man needs a Power Pellet and ghosts are scaring him, this will go on for a LONG time before the ghosts finally fly away.What really influences the game other than the slingshot is Pac-Man's mood. This is interestingly an important part of the game, because how he acts toward some things rely on his behavior. Some instances require him to be angry or happy, and some cause him to change his mood to such things.The formula overall is very, VERY unique and makes the game really interesting. Namco did a great job with the making of this game. Unfortunately, there are two problems: The lack of places to get Power Pellets AND the lack of an actual save feature. Yeah....you have to use passwords, so you better write em down..But other than those problems, the game is great.As for the game being an interactive cartoon, it really nails that. The game has a great sense of humor (EX: In the park, Pac-Man trips on rock, and slips on a skateboard, causing that skateboard to fly up in the air and land straight onto his head - There's also a billboard in the city that shows an anime person holding a hamburger. Pac-Man smiles as a laughable reaction to the billboard). Many things you shoot with the slingshot can cause a gut-buster.Actually, it seems like if you don't want to play through the main game, you could just have Pac-Man wander off and create your own little cartoon venture. Go ahead. Have Pac-Man brawl with a cat that stole his hot dog. Have a farmer's haystack fall flat onto him. Do whatever.If you're not interested in the actual game, Pac-Man 2 still has some value for you. If you go to the city's arcade, you'll find a fully playable Pac-Man arcade cabinet & Ms. Pac-Man. Or, if you want to avoid the game altogether, and go straight into the original Pac-Man or Ms. Pac-Man, you can enter these passwords:Pac-Man: PCMNDPWMs. Pac-Man: MSPCMNDPac-Man is that timeless classic we all know and love. Eat the dots, avoid ghosts, you know....all good stuff. Considering Pac-Man 2's price right now for a used copy, you could just buy this game right now just for the classic Pac-Man alone.Fortunately for you arcade Pac lovers out there, there's also Ms. Pac-Man in the mix. However, considering Ms. Pac-Man was eventually re-released for the SNES, with bunches of new features that made the game a bigger blast than the arcade original, it takes some of the fun out of this port, which doesn't have any of those features. You just simply play as is. Ms. Pac-Man is still a fun game on here, but I'd rather recommend getting the standalone SNES version, which makes one of the greatest games of all time that much better.All in all, Pac-Man 2 is a should-have. If you're a cartoon fanatic, you should pick this up right away. If you are looking for an unexpected challenge, the game certainly has that. If you are a Pac-Man fan, and wish for arcade-style action, Pac-Man 2 still offers the arcade classic and Ms. Pac-Man to satisfy your needs. There's something for everyone here!

If you are a Pac-Man fan, and wish for arcade-style action, Pac-Man 2 still offers the arcade classic and Pac-Jr to satisfy your needs. There's something for everyone here!

Tetris is one the best block-dropping puzzle games out there. Heck, it revolutionized that! Along with arriving on NES, it also plopped onto the portable Game Boy. It has all the same content as Nintendo's NES version, but with an addition of a 2-Player versus mode, and portability on that classic green and black pocket buddy!

In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. How will that work on 8-Bit systems, though?Fans often overlook this as a remake of Donkey Kong Country. Unfortunately for them, they are missing out, as this is actually a sequel. The gameplay and graphics are the same as the SNES game, but the levels and worlds are different. Is the story the same? No. In fact, the story is about, according the manual, DKC's success. Cranky Kong claims that the game only sold well because of the game's "fancy graphics" and that "kids would buy anything these days". A funny story to a satisfying game.Actually, the graphics are eye-popping on the old-school Game Boy. Even if the characters blend in the backgrounds a little, playing the game on a Game Boy Color or Advance helps them stand out better.The sounds and music were memorable. You can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle. Now that it's composed in 8-Bit, it would appeal to NES fans as well.The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even ride atop an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level, though it also kills enemies. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3.One thing I gotta point out is that there is no Candy's Save Point in this game. Instead, you'd be able to save your progress by collecting the K-O-N-G letters in a level.The whole game is just a lot of fun, and I'd continue playing it ever after beating it.Overall, this is a really great Game Boy game. You should get it for any Game Boy system you have.

The Wario Land games have been a pretty long-lasting series of bashing, enemy throwing, pouncing fun, but would you ever believe that the series started out as a conclusion to the Super Mario Land trilogy? The gameplay has changed so much from Super Mario Land 2 (Although you can probably still tell it was made from that game's engine), that it may as well go into a series of its own in the first place!Remember how extremely bizarre the worlds were in the previous games? Well, Wario Land is no different when it comes to that, but what it actually brings you could make you think "What the heck..?", and not in a bad way, either. These new landscapes are very interesting and fun to explore.Along with Wario's regular bash attack, Wario can collect power-ups to replace it, such as a Dragon Hat that blows fire, a Viking Helmet that upgrades Wario's bash attack and gives him a Ground Pound move, and a heart (More on that below).There is a Heart Counter, in which when you reach 100 hearts, you earn an extra life. You get these from killing enemies or collecting them from power-up boxes (As 20 hearts).As you earn more coins and treasures, you could change the game's ending scene depending on how much you have. Wario could buy several different representations of his money-wise condition, from poor (Birdhouse) to extremely mouth-watering rich (Mansion).All of those new gameplay quirks make the traditional gameplay pretty unique, making it stand out from the other entries in the Mario Land or Wario Land series.

Remember back in the arcades when Donkey Kong was an incredible hit? And then every game system back then got their own version of the game? Well it has been 13 years after the arcade game's release, and Nintendo was developing a new version of the game for Game Boy. At first glance you'd probably think: "Donkey Kong's already been released on several classic consoles already. So what's the point this one?" But if you look at the game itself, you'd go buy it already.Donkey Kong has 3 save files. When you start the game, you get to play through the 4 levels of the arcade game. But after beating Donkey Kong in the level with the disappearing yellow platforms, you saved Pauline, right? WRONG! When I saw DK get back up, capture Pauline, and run, I was amazed, and my mouth dropped. Mario was running after the big age. And now the real game starts.The main gameplay has Mario go fetch a key and then use the key to open up a locked door to move on. The levels are clever, fun to play, and just downright cool. In fact, Mario can use acrobatic skills to help him through the levels. He can somersault, flip, and perform handstand jumps.Later, Donkey Kong Jr. comes into the scene and helps out his daddy.The graphics are great, especially when played on the Super Game Boy. With the Super Game Boy, there's a border around the game that makes it look like it's on a Donkey Kong arcade machine. The graphics also shine during the final boss: Giant DK. He looks very cartoonish, but that is how the game is supposed to be: Cartoony and fun. Exercising, somersaulting Mario vs a huge King Kong-sized DK on top of a big building!The music and sounds are also very good. The tunes are memorable and who doesn't love the sound of collecting 1ups?Overall, this game is truly amazing and it's also one of the Game Boy's best.

F-Zero is known for showing off the Super Nintendo's extremely graphically impressive Mode 7 technology, which was beating off the Genesis's so-called Blast Processing.You select from 3 cups (Or in this case, Leagues), each with five futuristic courses.You start with 3 lives. If your car explodes, you will lose one.Each of the tracks sort of have their own gimmicks, most notably Death Wind, mines, and ramps.Once you cross the finish line, you can use an extra boost that you earn every time there.If you are losing health, be sure to steer towards a healing area.All of the gameplay would most likely resemble Super Mario Kart's gameplay, but this game came out right before it.

Once you get past the semi-weird steering, you'll begin to realize that the first of a terrific series of kart-racing games has a lot to offer. You get to race in around 20 tracks as your favorite of the eight playable characters, and use items against CPUs or your friend.I'm pretty sure everybody's favorite item would be the Star. I mean seriously, who doesn't like it?The 2-Player Battle Mode is where you and your friend pit against each other and throw random kinds of stuff at each other until one of you lose.Overall, do you wanna see what was first kart-racer has to offer? Go ahead and buy it.

As any Capcom guy would know, MegaMan is the hardest game series the company had ever created. Ever since the original NES version, it was hard. But it was still a great game. The Game Boy version, released after the NES sequel, was no exception.The Game Boy's smaller screen caused some slight changes to the formula. For example, MegaMan seems to have slightly less HP than in the NES games. However, there's less in the game's layout, too. So it kinda evens out.The sounds and music are also sounding different. Well, the music is carried over from MegaMan on the NES, but different 8-Bit instruments are used. Some sound effects are totally different, such as the Mega Buster sounds.The game has 4 robot masters compared to the NES game's 6. Even though the game is easier than the NES games, it's still pretty hard for people that aren't hardcore MegaMan fans. If you are one of those people, it'll take a while to get past all the robot masters and reach Dr. Wily. The precise controls, the tricky pathways, and difficult situations are all present. Fortunately, once you reach a robot master, it's possible you may beat him right away, or you lose a life or two and THEN beat him.The downside to the bosses is the weaknesses. They are off. For example, when I tried fighting Iceman, I used Fireman's power (Reasonable, right?), but it didn't do a whole lot of damage. Then I tried Elecman's power, and it took him out in 3 or 4 hits. (Edit: Never mind. This isn't actually an error.)In Dr. Wily's stage, things are just plain unforgiving the first time you play through it (Thank god for Passwords). There will be spikes in places you least expect, traps that seal you to your doom, etc. Also, before you fight Dr. Wily, you must battle 4 MORE robots from MegaMan 2 (NES game)! Be sure to get your powers ready, because you're in for a short marathon.But after this, you go through one last level. Then, you reach Dr. Wily at last, who is actually pretty easy once you get this pattern down: Use Quickman's power to shoot off the his robot's mouth, and then use the Energy Buster to reflect Wily's lasers, while avoiding a robo-claw that reaches for you.All of these events are packed into 6 levels of run 'n gun fun. Yeah, it's possible you can beat this game in 20-30 minutes, but at least you will have fun doing it.Overall, this is a really great game for the classic Game Boy. If you have a Game Boy, a Game Boy Color, or even a Game Boy Advance, itching for some classic MegaMan action, this is the game for you. If you are new to MegaMan, this should be a good place to start (Other than the Game Boy sequel, MegaMan II).

Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console.DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements.The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country.

Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun.The multiplayer is pretty cool, too. While you can't REALLY play co-op like in the new DKC game that's out on Wii, your friend can cover in for you if you die. One player plays as Donkey Kong, and the other plays as Diddy Kong. Once one player is participating in the action, the other player can't really do anything. But if that one player dies or presses Select, then it's time for the second player to play. You can also compete against each other.To save, you must reach Candy's Save Point. Personally, I wish they added a save anytime kind of feature. But that is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a really great Super NES gem. It's worth the money. Even if you don't have a Super Nintendo, it's also out for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. Oh, and Wii Virtual Console too....

1995 seemed to be a great year for a gamer. The Donkey Kong Country series went portable with DK Land, Rayman was a surprise full of perfection, and Vectorman appealed to Sega Genesis players with its colorful pre-rendered graphics that DKC had done. All of these games were great, but Yoshi's Island was the best of all. While Rayman would have been my favorite game of all time, it suffered from the most extreme difficulty EVER. Yoshi's Island has amazing graphics, catchy sound/music, awesome gameplay, AND forgiving difficulty alike.This is not the average Mario game, but rather is it what fans would call a Yoshi game, since it plays a lot differently. As Yoshi, you romp through levels like usual, but now you can throw eggs at enemies, as well as eat enemies to make eggs. There is also a huge variety of obstacles, like boulders, loads of unique platforms, collectible flowers, the enemies doing all kinds of stuff, etc, etc. But the thing is: It is all well-crafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences. Don't believe me? Go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage. One look and you'll agree that it looks beyond terrific.There are also some bonuses in the game to help you on your quest to defeat the evil Bowser Jr. For example, there are small houses that you may possibly find in a level (It requires a key, though). Once you are able to enter in, you must compete with an enemy in a certain challenge (Collect most coins, Pop most balloons, etc). There's also bonus challenges when the goal chooses a flower you had collected (In a roulette-like way).Overall, it's definitely one of the greatest platformers I have ever played. I may prefer Super Mario World as the best of all, but this game certainly comes close to winning that title.

Sonic has hit a major speed bump the past half-decade, but before that half-decade, he was on fire! Starting in 1991, the blue blur's first outing was one of his best. As Sonic, you go through 6 zones in high-speed action while tracking down a fat evildoer named Dr. Robotnik! The controls were pretty simple: You use a D-pad and a button to play. The graphics were full of 16-bit awesomism. The sounds and music were top-notch. The main challenge in the game, however, is not the difficulty in the zones as you progress through them, but instead, they are the Special Stages, in which you must finish an act with over 50 rings to access them. Then, in the Special Stages, you must guide yourself carefully to the Chaos Emeralds.Sonic's first hit was a blast. If you like Sonic games, especially the retro Sonics, give this a shot if you haven't played this one before.

Golden Axe is a hack 'n slash game originally released in arcades. The Genesis port has two more levels than the original, and some more features.Throughout the eight stages, you just beat up anybody in your way, as well as some bosses. You choose from 3 characters: A muscular warrior, a viking (Or gnome?), and a female fighter. Each character has their own kind of magic you can activate once pressing A, though that will use up all the pot you have collected from the thieves. Some bosses are easy, others may be hard. Heck, the second Death Adder (Known as Death Bringer) uses magic once he hits you, and that is saying something due to the fact that no enemy uses magic.What I find odd is that the Death Adder boss counted as a separate stage, rather than entering the castle and the boss being in the same level like in the arcade version. And what just plain bothers me is how Sega recolored the viking/gnome's axe silver in this version, whereas the arcade version's axe is actually GOLD, like how the title is supposed to describe it.Along with the Normal mode is a Beginner mode and a Duel mode.The Beginner mode only lets you play through the first 3 levels. I guess that's fair for newer players.The Duel mode plays like a fighting game since you have to beat up a certain enemy(ies) to move on. You start with so much HP, but if you lose all of it, you can't advance. There are no credits/continues in this mode.There are a few options that you can change for the regular game. You can have 5 hit points instead of 3, and you can, of course, change the control settings.Overall, this is a neat hack 'n slash that has been a Sega arcade hit for a while.

DRMBM is actually a puzzle game rather than your average platformer. It's actually based off of the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog show and it is probably the only game to be.The main game is connecting 3 of the same color. It's Puyo Puyo but with an American Sonic theme. There's a VS mode, a Training mode (Which is like playing solo in Tetris), and a Story mode that pits you against Dr. Robotnik's half-baked robots.The Game Over screen is pretty funny. During the countdown time for you to continue, Dr. Robotnik dances and taunts during the whole countdown. At the near end of it, he laughs evilly.The puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting, and it is still a fun game to this day.

It's honestly hard to believe this game was released in 1995. It's the same year that brought us Vectorman, Rayman, Windows 95 and its games, and lots more stuff (Movies like Toy Story!). But why Sonic has to step into the ring with Sonic Labyrinth on the Game Gear is beyond me. Yes, folks. Even Classic Sonic had skeletons in his closet, and this is one of them.So apparently, Sonic happens to be wearing super-slow shoes built by none other than Dr. Robotnik. But the question is: Why? Why does Sega have to offer us a game that could have been the Game Gear equivalent for Sonic 3D Blast, and remove Sonic's trademark speed? And to have to utilize a stupid storyline to go with it (Robotnik waits outside Sonic's HOUSE while he's sleeping, and gives a speech about his "evil" plan)? This would've been MUCH more fun if Sonic was Sonic. Granted, he still has the Spin Dash, but you'll have to be using that every single time if you want to go somewhere. It gets annoying really.On top of all that, the music (for once) is terrible and forgettable, and while the graphics are decent, they won't be able to make up for the utter mess Sonic Labyrinth has to offer. Stick with any other Sonic game. Sonic Labyrinth is not worth the money.

Back in the day, most of what you were seeing on the Atari 2600 were either arcade ports or one-screened games. They're mostly pretty fun to play, but when this game came into the scene, it blew them away quickly.Pitfall did not just stay in one screen. It was one of the first side-scrollers, although one screen moves to the next rather than move with character.The gameplay was really fun and addicting. At the time, the game felt like an adventure. You must find the treasures while avoiding hazards like alligators, snakes, fires, and scorpions. The alligators, however, also help you across lakes, since they let you jump on their heads.There is a lot to explore in Pitfall. There are so many screens in this game that I can't count the limits exploring within the game.The graphics are really good for the Atari. They are colorful and they give Pitfall Harry an iconic outfit.The sounds are pure Atari 2600 sound effects. There is no music, but it didn't matter, because it's Atari. And who can remember that sound when Harry swings on a vine? Sounded pretty heavenly at the time.Overall, if you are an Atari junkie, you can't be complete without this game.
