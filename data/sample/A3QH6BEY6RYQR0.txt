The autobots are now a part of the human military complex, and are threatened by the decepticons, who want to bring their world to earth. The autobots will be eliminated and humans will be their slaves. The autobots team with Sam Witwicky to save human civilization from destruction. The visuals in this film are absolutely stunning, and I was actually grabbed by the storyline in the film. It was interesting to see if the autobots would be able to fend off their bitter rivals. Sam Witwicky is still likeable, as is his new girlfriend. The 3D effect benefits this one, as the non-stop action really comes alive. This is good escapist entertainment.

A young woman is preparing for her wedding, when her fianc&eacute; suddenly leaves her. Heartbroken, she tries to get over it, while dealing with new relationship problems. The fianc&eacute; reemerges and she must decide whether or not to get back together with him. The underappreciated Greta Gerwig carries this one well, as the jilted woman who is trying to find her way in world of love and relationships. There is a solid combination of laughs and emotion here as the film touches on s subject many of us are familiar with. Big Screen portrayals of the pursuit of companionship are as old as film itself, but when done in a quality manner, they are always enjoyable.

This movie Is another Nicholas Sparks story with the usual drama. This time it's Miley Cyrus playing the lead, in this case a young woman visiting her father for the summer, a man with whom she has a strained relationship. There, she `surprise!' meets a really hunky guy with whom she becomes involved. Forgive me if you've heard this story before. Drama ensues when she has rocky times with the new guy, and her father falls ill. The film is saved from mediocrity with solid work from Greg Kinnear as the girl's dad, and her younger brother, who is the funniest and most engaging character in the film. There were some tears being shed by the women In the audience near the end of the film, so something must have been done right.

A scrawny young man wants to enlist in the army to fight WWII, but is turned away. He is chosen for an experiment, which will transform him into the ultimate soldier, Captain America. Top notch special effects highlight this latest in a long line of superhero films, and it is one of the better ones. He has a love interest that is not only beautiful, but also has a tough side. Tommy Lee Jones is good as always, as the officer leading the band of soldiers. He brings humor even as his character is playing it straight. Helped by the 3D, this movie is a lot of fun.

A lesbian couple has raised two children. Coming of age, the kids contact their biological father, and the dynamic that he brings to lives of the family creates tension within the household. This is real-life drama that grabs the viewer with its honest look at a family in crisis. The acting is solid throughout, with the emotional strain of a marriage on the verge of collapsing bringing an edge to the dramatic events that transpire.

A church pastor does a service for those who believe they are possessed by demons by performing an Exorcism, which in reality is a show with demon sounds and other realistic effects. He is requested to come to the aid of a teenage girl, who may have problems beyond the usual belief in possession. This documentary style film brings an essence of realism to its storyline, and draws the viewer into the pastor's journey of determining just what has befallen this girl. The questionable finale may reduce the film's impact for some movie-goers, but this is a worthwhile venture for those who enjoy a unique film experience.

The townsfolk commonly harass the man and tell stories about him, and the funeral is planned so that he can clear the air about his mysterious past. The mystery surrounding the man's story is engrossing, and Bill Murray provides levity to the film in a role that he was perfect for.

A star-laden film containing several interconnected plotlines involving people either in love, falling in love, falling out of love, or wanting love. It is Valentines Day (surprise!) and the personal lives of multiple people are affected in different ways. At times, funny, other times touching, the film was effective at weaving together many different storylines without short-changing any of them, or being difficult to follow. A fun film for an evening out with your significant other, or, if you don't have someone, see it alone.

He has a strained relationship with his Father, the tribe's chief, because of his lack of physical gifts. During the course of the film, he encounters the most feared dragon species, befriending the creature. The film is engaging, funny, exciting, and the animation is top notch.

A 14 year-old girl begins communicating online with a friend that pretends to be an age-appropriate boy, but turns-out to be a much older man. After she is taken advantage of, she and her family must deal with the fall-out. This is a very relevant story today, and the thing that elevates this film is the superb acting. There are several talented actors in this one, and the girl's performance is excellent. The emotional drama that this family endures is riveting, and there is a twist at the end that provides the film with an emotional punch. This movie is highly recommended.

The longtime friends develop an even closer bond while trying to survive the rough downtown life. The low budget shooting enhances the realism of the film, with the viewer becoming invested in the welfare of the protagonists. This is a strong recommendation for a charming little movie.

The pending nuptials of a young woman brings her friends together as her bridesmaids, and hilarity ensues. The film's star is her maid of honor, who has man issues, and a rivalry with one of the other women of the wedding party. I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. The humor does contain some raunchiness, but it is not overdone. There are legitimate laugh out loud moments in this one, but the strength of the film is its heart. Relationship issues are dealt with, quite often with laughter, and there are several talented comedic actresses here, all bringing something different to the table. I could have done without the bathroom gross out scene, but otherwise Bridesmaids is an unexpected treat.

A young couple falls in love in college, but the woman is here on a student visa. She overstays her visa, and is later unable to return to be with him after attending her sister's wedding. Over the course of time, they grow apart and then come back together, always facing the dilemma of how they are going to make their relationship work. On the positive side, I appreciate the dilemma that the couple faces, deciding between others that they have connected with and getting back together. The negative of this film is that the natural course of events appears to be for them to grow apart, living on separate continents, and the movie just does not let it happen. Overall, the positive outweighs the negative enough to get a recommendation.

A young woman with mental health issues comes under the care of Dr. Jung, a psychiatrist and a friend of Sigmund Freud. Dr. Jung is married, but has an affair with his new patient. The affair becomes public, damaging the doctor's reputation. The woman eventually becomes a mental health practitioner in her own right. This one was interesting, with a look at how a doctor can put his family life and professional reputation in peril by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a patient. The film is well paced, and the acting is solid. If you are seeking a movie that is not the usual holiday fluff, this is a good one to check out.

This movie tells the story of a woman who was once the most popular girl in high school, now a bit down on her luck, returning to her hometown, attempting to reconnect with a now-married ex-boyfriend. While there, she befriends another former acquaintance, a nerdy guy from her school to whom she would not have given the time of day as a teenager. This is a well-written and well-acted story of a lady trying to recapture her best years and perhaps hook-up with a guy that she regrets not having in her life. Screenwriter Diablo Cody is at the top of her game, telling a story that is funny, clever, and emotional and will touch a nerve with varying members of the audience. Don't miss this one.

A boy raises a horse that turns out to be quite a spectacular creature. The horse is sold off during WWI and embarks on a journey through several owners, making an impact on everyone who encounters him. The question in everyone's mind is "will the horse be reunited with his original owner?" I will let the viewer discover the answer to that burning question while seeing the movie. As for the film itself, it is classic Spielberg; a heartwarming storyline, visually spectacular, and a well-told tale. The Schmaltz is turned on a bit here, but the movie's strengths, particularly the realistic war scenes, far outweigh its weaknesses. This is another fine effort from Hollywood's greatest director.

A couple in a happy, but routine, marriage decide to go for one of their date nights, and find a way to spice this one up a bit. They do this by going to a swanky downtown restaurant, where they sit in on someone else's dinner reservation. While there, they are confronted by a couple of thugs, who have mistaken them for the couple who had the actual dinner reservation. The couple spends the rest of the evening trying to stay alive while figuring out a way to get out of this mess, while at the same time, dealing with some of their marriage issues. This is an entertaining and very funny film that is buoyed by the talent at hand, not only Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, the a skilled supporting cast, who all bring a smart brand of humor.

Two Couples get together to discuss a fight between their two kids. They spend the entire day arguing with each other, with the discussion beginning friendly enough, then evolving into outright verbal warfare. This film features four top-notch actors, each bringing their own unique gifts to their respective roles. The movie is short and features a few laughs, with the characters trying to maintain a modicum of civility while hurling verbal zingers at one another. This is a solid, if unspectacular film that is worth seeing.

I am currently on the page for the unrated and uncut edition, which I did not see, but the theatrical version is top notch.

The original cast is back (sans one) and they are aiming to pull off a heist after putting together a team. The Rock is a welcome addition to the franchise as a federal agent who specializes in tracking down fugitives. There is a lot of excitement in this one, with the distinctive storyline of the bad guys being the good guys because they are stealing from worse guys. It makes sense when you see it. Are there some improbabilities that occur during the course of the action? Certainly, but if not taken too seriously, this is a good old-fashioned action film. Car chases, gun fights and explosions are ubiquitous in Fast Five, and if that is your idea of a good time, sit back and enjoy the ride.

After seeing the adulation that Elvis Presley receives from girls, he forms a local band. Shortly thereafter, he meets a young musician named Paul and.....well, you know where that leads. The lead performance by Aaron Johnson is outstanding. An emotionally gripping look at the growth of John Lennon that has an especially poignant closing which shows still photos of John as he grew into a man.

His guilt or innocence is seriously in question early on, and the case brings into doubt the guilt of one of his previous clients who is currently imprisoned. The lead character, Mickey Haller is not very likable, but the storyline is quite engrossing.

The resolution of the case is not seriously in question, but the journey in getting there is worth the trip.

This is a very exciting science fiction drama that is sort of a cross between E.T. and Close Encounters. The acting, the visuals and the sound effects here are all top notch, and there is constant excitement throughout. The movie can be a little intense at times, so it may not be for children. If you are looking for pure escapism, and a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one.

A young family is being frightened in their home by spirits in this prequel to Paranormal Activity, one of the most intriguing films of 2009. The storyline revolves around the action in the original, with the haunting from Katie's childhood now returning to terrorize the family of her stepsister. The same documentary style that brought an eerie realism the first is used here, and remains effective. The sense of discovery present in the original is diluted, but overall the follow-up is worthy of its predecessor.

This film successfully melds the western and science fiction genres, bringing to the screen a fun and exciting action film with a little mystery thrown in. It starts out working well as a typical western, and the addition of the aliens does nothing to hurt the film's quality. Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are both top-notch as always and this one definitely works.

This is a smart and funny romantic-comedy that will keep you laughing. The role of the British PM's communication director is particularly good as she brings quite a few comedic moments to the film while trying to get people on board with the project. As for the project assistants, two people who are at first colleagues and friends develop feelings for each other and the viewer is interested to see if they will end up together.

Featuring the highly talented Elizabeth Olsen, this movie is quite scary up until the final minutes when the story takes an unexpected turn. This is when the film loses something, but it does distinguish it as more than just a standard horror film. I found the movie very frightening and unpredictable. Liz Olsen is such a talent, she is able to project true fright throughout, and the film is able to maintain this until the surprising conclusion. Overall, this is a solid effort in the horror genre.

Filmed documentary styles, the movie tells the story of three high school boys who encounter some sort of alien ship or something, and then acquire superhuman powers of telekinesis. Predictably, things spiral out of control for the three. This is a realistic, and quite good film about a young man with problems who is unable to control the powers he discovers. His two friends try to help, but they are unable to control him. This one was a pleasant surprise and is the best movie of its kind since Paranormal Activity.

A massive cruise liner thought to be unsinkable (spoiler alert!) hits an iceberg and does just that. The film focuses on a fictional couple who fall in love and pursue a relationship despite their differences, and the unfortunate circumstance of being on a sinking ship. This 1997 film became a box-office smash and a cultural phenomenon. It is enhanced by the 3D experience, and is well-worth investing your time and movie dollars. What made the film so good was the combination of the riveting sequence of the ship going under, the love story that captured hearts everywhere, and an easy to hate villain. A return trip to Titanic is an experience we should all undertake.

He does this while being the President of the United States. This is a violent fantasy that has a bit if fun with the memory of perhaps our greatest president. He is trying to end slavery in this nation, but the vampires have been feeding off of slaves, so this threatens not only their existence, but the continued existence of our nation. You cannot take this one too seriously, yet it is not a campy parody. The serious tone and the ridiculous storyline mesh quite well together to bring us a film that is a welcome diversion. A premise so silly can be forgiven when a movie is this much bloody fun.

She sets out to not only survive, but find out who betrayed her and get back at them. This may sound like standard action-revenge fare, but it is more than that. This is a smart, well-paced action thriller, containing well-choreographed fight scenes, and a cast of talented actors. The lead actress in this film is an MMA fighter and her skills are on display here. She is attractive, athletic, and strikes just the right combination of leading lady and kick-a** fighter.

The two men recruit other mutants to prevent a deranged man from starting WWIII. The thing that separates this from some other films in the superhero genre is that this is a movie with a strong storyline carried by talented actors. This is more than a fun film for fanboys, but a movie that can be appreciated by all audiences. The visuals are amazing, as are the nuance performances by the film's talented cast.

This prequel to the Planet of the Apes films is engrossing, exciting, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The visuals of the apes are terrific, and the storyline is believable in the context presented. The film is not overly violent, as the apes do not produce a high human body count, and there is not a sequence of bloody violence. Stick around for the end credits, or you'll miss something. This is more summer fun, and you don't want to miss it.

Another film from Garry Marshall with many stars and several unrelated (and some related) storylines, this time surrounding New Year's Eve. This is a romantic- comedy that actually does contain a little of each, with a bit of depth in a couple of the performances. The stories each differ, and in some way members of the audience may relate to a particular one that somehow is relevant to their experiences. Due to the brevity of the differing plots, there is no strong emotional connection for the viewer with any of them, but for light entertainment on a holiday weekend, New Year's Eve is one that you might want to check out.

Three friends come together and decide to eliminate their respective work supervisors, whom they all hate, for different reasons. This is another in a long line of modern-day comedies containing coarse language throughout, which does have its place (see Superbad), but at times is used to replace good comedy. In this case, the problem I have with the film is that it just isn't as funny as it should be. The movie has a strong cast, and they almost make it work. The movie does have its moments, but when the outtakes during the closing credits are funnier than the movie you just watched, you know that it was not all that good.

This brings the expected complications, resulting in the predictable "will they or won't they" ending. This one is a mixed bag. The leads have good chemistry, and the parents of both bring a bit of depth to the story. However, the formula has certainly been done before, and nothing new is added here. Might be a good movie to take your girlfriend out to see, as it has a few laughs, and may lead to some hanky panky. Just make sure you wait until you get home.

This is a solid action-adventure film that will appeal primarily to a male audience, with its tough-guy sequences and non-stop action, but is not merely a mindless, violent male action fantasy. It has a heady plot, and there is a surprise twist at the end. Contraband is a straightforward action film that most moviegoers should enjoy.

An infamous CIA agent who has been on the run for years suddenly appears and is overseen by a young agent trying to make a name for himself. Why did he disappear and why did he suddenly show up? These questions are answered in the midst of some of the most riveting action sequences in recent years. Fine acting and an intriguing story highlight one of the most solid action films we've seen. The excitement doesn't let up throughout, and the question of who are the "good guys" and who are the "bad guys" is ever-present. This one is very well-done.

Following a car accident, a woman has no memory of the time she has spent with her husband, or of even meeting him. He tries to resume their life together, and she struggles to live with a man that she does not know. Strong lead chemistry highlights this solid romantic-comedy, with the couple playing well off each other and clearly enjoying their time rekindling their romance. There are many moments of difficulty, with the lady trying to re-enter a life that she doesn't remember, and a former boyfriend entering the picture. Well-scripted and well-acted, this is a very good date night movie, or one you may like seeing solo.

A family of little people live under the home of an everyday American family. They survive by sneaking into the house at night, and "borrowing" whatever supplies they need to sustain themselves. The girl of the borrowers befriends a boy of the big family. This was a very well-told story of friendship and survival. This movie avoids overly cute characters and musical numbers and simply is straightforward in its telling of a very interesting tale. It has good music in it that serves the purpose of supporting the story instead of distracting from it. The movie doesn't contain over the top visuals, and simply captivates the viewer through the use of good scripting and character development. This is a high-quality animated feature.

This chronicles the Patriots post-season run in January of 2002. It has each of the games they won in the playoffs. I was surprised that the video contains the game play-by-play. I thought they would edit the games and have a voiceover describing the action. There is some of that, but mostly, it is the entire game, but with the slow parts edited out, so that it moves along quickly, with the radio calls of the Patriots radio team playing. I put it in once in a while to relive the glory days. This is a must-have for all Patriots fans.

Woody and the gang are back. Andy is going off to college and the toys have been donated to a daycare center. Woody must try to return his friends to Andy, despite being unsure of their fate if he does so. This film captures the sentiment of the original. It is an exciting action adventure that may bring a tear to your eye in the end.

A man in a small Texas town befriends an unfriendly woman whom he kills. The town is behind him, as he is so well-liked and was quite generous with her money. This movie features interviews with people who actually knew the participants, and these interviews are combined with excellent storytelling. Jack Black is terrific in his portrayal of a really nice and well-regarded man who did something no one expected of him. His victim was not well-liked by anyone, making her a very unsympathetic figure. This is a funny movie with interesting characters that will keep you laughing and entertained.

A young woman is getting married. Her wedding should be a celebration, but simmering beneath the surface is her battle with depression, which mars the day of the wedding. Her sister seems to be the most aware and tries to help her get through the day. The second half of the film focuses on the sister and her fear of a star named Melancholia which may be on a collision course with earth. The first part of the movie was quite good, with the bouts of depression interfering with a well-planned wedding, and the expectation that her condition will make it quite difficult for the marriage to work. The film loses a little something in the second half, because the storyline then veers into another direction, and just doesn't seem consistent with the real-life drama of the first part. This is solid work, but should have stuck with the promise of the first half.

A group of men who are all friends are at varying degrees of relationship status with women. They soon find that their ladies are manipulating the men in their lives using a book that was written for women who are having relationship problems. The men then turn the tables on them by using the information in the book to their own advantage. This all may sound devious, but it is in fact quite funny. An attractive cast of actors and actresses make this romantic-comedy well worth seeing, providing a lot of laughs and relationship situations that many of us may be familiar with. The results may be predictable, but the route that takes us there is funny and entertaining.

Agents J and K are back, this time dealing with the threat of an alien who has been imprisoned for 40 years and has a score to settle. Will Smith goes back to 1969 and meets the younger version of his partner in order to save him. The usual chemistry is again present and is added to by the presence of Josh Brolin, who is terrific as a young Tommie Lee Jones. The film is uneven at times, but the interesting situation of being placed in a different time period is always fun to watch, as Agent J gets a taste of what it was like to be a person of color in 1969. Though not quite as fun as the original, MIB 3 does provide enough to satisfy fans of the franchise.

Three young women at a college greet a new girl and welcome her into their clique. They are a unique collection of attractive young ladies who volunteer at a suicide prevention center and think they have their hands on the pulse of the student body. Their unusual verbalized ruminations are often quite humorous, and they are very likeable. They deal with some typical issues that college students face (relationships), but the film does not veer into the territory of your standard college boy-girl drama. This is an unusual and entertaining film featuring talented young actresses and is a movie that most audiences will enjoy.

Mel Gibson is a Boston Police detective whose daughter is murdered. First believing he was the target, it soon becomes apparent that his daughter was involved in something that put her life in danger. He tries to discover who the murderer is and why she was killed. A standard, but effective revenge drama, laced with the plotline of a conspiracy film. The storyline of the film is not too complex or convoluted, and Mel Gibson is convincing as the angry father out for answers and for revenge. This one is worth seeing.

Two friends inadvertently change bodies, assuming each other's life until they are able to reverse the curse that has been placed. While enduring this, they are able to learn about one another, while also appreciating the lives that they have. This is a storyline that we have seen before, and this film does nothing to improve the concept. This is definitely an adult comedy, and it does contain some funny moments. The characters are likeable and I was laughing out loud at times, but overall this is a movie that does not raise the bar of modern comedy in film. It meets the bar just enough to get a modest recommendation.

A rare bird is kidnapped from his adoring owner, who must try to retrieve him. Along the way, the bird encounters various delightful, and some not so delightful, characters. Top notch animation, colorful visuals, and prudent voice selections highlight this animated delight. The storyline and the humor will appeal to adults and children alike, as I found myself getting a few laughs out of this one. The 3D effect is outstanding, and this is a movie for which you will want to lay out the extra expense for the 3D glasses. You don't need a babysitter tonight, as the whole family will enjoy this one.

An 1800's man finds himself on another planet, around alien beings. The planet is in the midst of a civil war, with one group of beings planning on taking over the territory of others. John Carter befriends them, and aids them in their fight, while also falling for a beautiful princess who is part of a local human-like species. All the while, one wonders if he will be able to return to earth. The visuals in this film are amazing, and the characters created are actually likeable. When John Carter first meets a local being it is actually quite funny, and the viewer can see the beginning of a camaraderie forming. At times the details of who are the aggressors and who is being threatened could have been more clearly delineated, as this genre does not lend itself will to a storyline that has a gray area in its portrayal of good and evil. Taken as a whole, the movie is a visually stunning film that does enough to keep the viewer entertained.

The whole gang is back for a high school reunion and they must deal with adult problems of marital difficulties, career stagnation, and culture change since 1999. They attempt to deal with all this while trying to have a blast at their reunion get-together. There is a little raunchy humor and some nudity in this one, but I found it quite funny and entertaining. It was good to see the old faces from a 90's comedy classic all together again, and up to some of their old tricks. Their lives have changed since high school, but they still know how to have a good time. This is a film series that has a pretty funny current installment.

The dictator of a fictional nation comes to the U. S., and his trusted assistant attempts to betray him. This comedy features the man known for Borat, and features some fairly distasteful moments. Sacha Baron Cohen has quite a knack for comedy, and as always, he is sometimes off, and sometimes on in this one. There are some real belly laughs in this one, but in between quite a bit of the humor falls flat. Some of the jokes in this movie were actually quite creative and original, but I just felt that too much of the film was trying too hard to find humor where there was none. Overall, I would say there are better ways to spend your movie dollars.

A group of Navy ships encounter an alien spacecraft intent on doing bad things to the human race. It is up to surviving crew members to save the world. Loosely based on the classic board game, this action film contains the requisite noise, explosions, and fight scenes one would expect from a summer blockbuster. Don't take this one too seriously, as there are flaws in the storyline. There is certainly nothing new in this one, as it is another mindless action movie that will appeal to its target audience of young men, who will revel in the excitement and the visuals. This is a movie tailored to fans of the action-adventure genre who don't want to be challenged intellectually.

A group of scientists and crewmembers set out to travel to a distant planet to discover the meaning behind some ancient cave drawings. It is the year 2093 and there may be life present on this remote planet. This prequel to the great 1980 film Alien contains the pre-story to the discovery of the species that terrified the crew of that film. Modern-day expertise has improved the visual capabilities that filmmakers can achieve, which are enhanced further by 3D technology in this film. Unfortunately, Ridley Scott populated this film with characters that you don't get to know well and don't particularly care about, sans one. However, the movie is exciting and visually stimulating enough to make it a worth while film-going experience.

Okay, I saw this movie and was pretty disappointed. The storyline is that this young girl is visiting her father on island where he is a researcher of some sort. He gets lost at sea, and the girl, alone on the island, must do what she can to survive and also locate her dad. She communicates with a writer, played by Jodie Foster.Now, don't you think that this guy, being a man of science and living on that island for some time now, would have been astute enough to see that there was a storm coming and to not go sailing on that particular day? Also, this island has a mountain on it which is quite steep and treacherous, yet, this girl walks up and down it as if its a 12 foot hill.The Jodie Foster character is an agoraphobic who hasn't left her apartment for months, yet she is able to find her way to the island in a matter of a couple of days, when she has never heard of it before, and only has a vague idea of where it is located. I didn't understand why she was in the movie anyway. I thought her character was going to help the girl find her father, but that wasn't the case.It insulted my intelligence to sit through this one, and avoids the one-star designation because I like the cast and there are a few cute sequences when the girl interacts with the animals on the island.

The true story of an autistic woman who graduated from ASU and developed ideas on how to properly practice animal husbandry in a manner that was beneficial for both the animals and their handlers. The film presents the difficulties of a condition that was, and still is, largely misunderstood, as well as a woman who has to deal with functioning in a male dominated industry. The viewer is able to see the world through the eyes of its protagonist, and a virtuoso performance by Claire Danes highlights an overall solid effort.

In a futuristic world, much of the population of the U S. is divided up into zones, where they are each required to send two of their children to compete In a survival contest where only one survives. The contest is a reality show that is televised for all to see. The participants are manipulated by the people running the game in order to maximize entertainment value for the masses watching at home. This was a riveting and realistic movie that features young people fighting for their survival and the instincts of them to either be ruthless or cooperative dictate how they will behave during the games. The handheld camera work may be nausea inducing for some, but otherwise this is a terrific story of a bond developing and of the efforts of young people to survive.

An Algerian immigrant replaces a teacher who committed suicide in the classroom. The students understandably have difficulty dealing with the trauma, and the new teacher tries to help them, while dealing with his problem of fleeing possible persecution in his home country. The difficulties that teachers of young children have are also addressed, as the school must strike a balance between the allowing the bonding of teachers and students and protecting the kids from predators. The relationships that Mr. Lazhar develops with his students and also his co-workers are at the heart of this film, and it is a very effective dramatic movie about a man trying to help kids he cares about while also tending to his own problems.

An aspiring young filmmaker spent a short time in 1956 on the set of a Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe film as an assistant director. He became close to Marilyn as many men had, and ended up a key figure in the production. Marilyn Monroe was notoriously difficult to work with in Hollywood and that is well-dramatized here. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn Monroe in this one and her performance highlights a realistic look at the difficulties that Marilyn had with trying to be a serious Hollywood actress while dealing with her insecurities and a prescription drug habit. This film was a pleasant surprise and another terrific movie to see during the holiday season.

The first part of this gets five stars from me. It chronicles Bird's early years, his college career, and his time with the Celtics. Seeing game highlights, and hearing the calls of Tommy Hiensohn, are exciting. This is one of my favorite DVD's of all time. My problem with the extras is the same criticism I leveled at the Celtics history DVD. It contains 3 of his best games in their entirety. NBA games have a lot of slow moments. You have to either sit through them, or try to fast forward to the exciting parts of the game, but you end up missing many of the great moments. They should have edited the games, with a voiceover describing the dramatics, and have crowd noise, sounds of the game , and announcer calls in the background. That would have made this an outstanding DVD. AS it is, the Larry Bird DVD is very good, and I recommend it.

Okay, I have been a Celtics fan for many years, and was really excited to get this. I was disappointed. It begins with a team history, which is interesting enough. It just neglects to mention the time when the team was formed and almost folded. Then you have a few segments about their 70's playoff runs. Again, these are fun to watch. It is interesting to see the difference in the television coverage back then.Then the problems begin. The golden years of the 80's when the Big Three played should be a highlight, but at the time, NBA films made their videos with this dopey background music. So you are watching this great footage of Celtics games, and instead of the raucous Boston Garden crowd, Johnny Most making the calls, sounds of the game, you get this lousy music playing while the voiceover speaks. The best part of these segements are the few moments when you hear Johnny Most and Garden crowd. It is fun to watch the players and coaches of the day, and to see the short shorts that were in style at the time. Curiously, the trade that brought DJ to the team is never mentioned.Then you have some of the best Celtic games presented in their entirety, and for me that is the problem. Who wants to sit through an entire basketball game that was played 25 or 40 years ago, when you know what the result will be? Why do I want to watch free throws that were attempted in 1986? That is a waste of my time. Give me the highlights and the game action. What they should have done was edit together highlights of the games with a voiceover describing the dramatic moments, crowd noise in the background, the sounds of the game. If they had done that, this would be a terrific collection.As it is, this is a decent set that does have some good points, but overall, it could have been much better.

An Iranian film about a couple seeking a divorce. They split, and the man stays with his ailing father, hiring a lady to care for him. Problems arise, and legal troubles ensue for the man. This is a terrific film that portrays problems that are common to couples the world over. The conservative Iranian customs bring additional concerns for women who have less control over their lives in a male dominated culture. Regardless of the locality, this was a very well-told story about a family dealing with difficulties and is an outstanding foreign film.

A group of men see their plane go down in an extremely cold climate. The few that survive find themselves dealing with not only the extreme cold, but a pack of hungry wolves. One of the men assumes a leadership role because of his knowledge of the wolves. This is an intense and exciting movie that avoids being a standard action film where characters you don't care about are killed one-by-one. The brutality of the wolves is evident and the efforts of the men to survive are amazing. You will find yourself invested in their determination and saddened when the effort is for naught. This is a good one.

This is a film that presents a fictional company in the very real situation as the 2008 financial meltdown began. Profits have been high, but their business model of packaging mortgages together as securities to sell, is collapsing. A recently fired analyst brought forth information revealing that their potential losses are greater than the value of the company. This film presents the real-life scenario that some investment companies and banks faced, without confusing the viewer with too much information. The movie does not overdramatize the events, but is able to stay focused on the storyline, while also remaining interesting to those who may not have closely followed the real-life events.

This clever comedy has quite a few talented actors in it, and while not laugh-out-loud funny, it does have some witty moments and the film is enhanced by the talent within. I found myself enjoying the journey of these two misfit children who have each found their soul mate, and at times appear to be beyond their years. Overall, this is a smart, funny, well-made comedy that will keep you rooting for the two young people.

The plot thickens when the woman's mother realizes that her former high school friend/enemy is a close confidante of the bride, and the two of them are competing with each other. This all turns out to have moments of hilarity and other instants of emotional bonding between the characters. This film was a pleasant surprise, eschewing silliness for solid comedy.

Going the Distance is funny, moving, and feels genuine.

A young boy is held captive by an abusive mother. The three parts of the film are all woven together to tell a story. This one can be pretty creepy and is not for everyone.

If you appreciate a bizarre horror film with a unique way to tell a tale, you may like this one.

The movie approaches the borderline of inappropriate content without crossing it.

A young couple is enduring the dissolution of their marriage. Scenes of their fighting are intercut with flashbacks to when they first met. This brings a brilliant contrast between the magical time when you meet someone and fall in love, and the time when circumstances have caused the union to fall apart. The movie is difficult to watch at times, but life brings its difficulties. The strength of this movie is its realism, with the viewer being thrust into the end of a doomed relationship. Outstanding performances by the two lead performers are a highlight, making this one of the year's finest films.

The story of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman elected Prime Minister of England. The movie begins with her later years suffering from Alzheimer's and flashes back to her early days as a young woman and her time in office. The movie only provides a snapshot of who she is, and perhaps could have focused less on her current condition, and given more weight to her rise from an eager young woman to the leadership of Great Britain. The primary reason to see this one is for one of the great performance by Meryl Streep. The iconic actress is at her finest, and successfully delves into the role, transforming herself into "The Iron Lady." If you enjoy great acting, this is a good one to see.

This movie is about a mother who has a lot of difficulty raising her son. The beginning intercuts between scenes of her pregnancy, dealing with the boy, getting a new job, and dealing with harassment by neighbors. The film then begins to utilize more of a linear storyline to tell the story of a child who terrorizes his mother while manipulating the father. This behavior culminates in a violent outburst that causes the mother to be targeted by other neighborhood parents, who hold her responsible. This is a very powerful film that realistically portrays the difficulty she has with dealing with a boy that she truly loves, but who only cares about himself. This was one of the best movies of the year.

This is another in a series of Disney Nature films, this one focusing on chimpanzees. Specifically, a youngster named Oscar who sees his extended family fend off competitors, while he tries to learn the ways of the jungle. This is the usual kid-friendly fare that adults will also find entertaining that Disney has released each of the last few years at this time. They are able to find a storyline while filming these wild creatures, and also capture some amazing footage while doing it. The narration provides a few light moments, and it is amazing how these wild animals are so similar to humans in their efforts to raise their young and to protect territory. Educational and entertaining, this is a good movie to see with the kids.

The evil brother of Thor opens up a portal allowing alien beings up to no good to wreak havoc upon humankind. A group of superheroes is formed in order to save the planet as we know it. This is the culmination of a series of superhero films and this one features all the main characters, bringing them together, allowing them to use their unique gifts in order to dispose of the bad guys. Bringing all of these alpha males (and one female) together does present its problems, as they at times are competing with each other. However, they are able to put aside any differences and work together for the common good. There are also a few laughs, but the highlights of this one are the spectacular visuals. This is a visually stimulating film that is a solid start to the summer movie season.

This movie was recommended by a former co-worker, and I finally got around to seeing it. I am so glad that I did. A social outcast office worker witnesses a shooting and saves a beautiful woman's life. She asks that he end her life so she doesn't have to live as a quardraplegic. A really creepy performance by Christian Slater highlights this one, and it is quite an interesting film. Elisha Cuthbert is excellent here, and the two meld well onscreen. Too bad this one didn't find an audience because it is a real winner.

based in 1999, this one tells the story of an LAPD officer, working at the Rampart division, who is crossing the line and venturing to the other side of the law. This recalls the LAPD Rampart scandal of the era, when officers were framing suspects, and planting drugs and weapons on them. The movie goes between the story of the officer's problems on the job, and the relationship difficulties with his daughters and two exes. The problem I had with the movie was that it focused a little too much on the family situation and not enough on the policing scandal. The film would have been more compelling had it been more focused on the officer being involved in overstepping his authority and getting involved in possible criminal activity. A bit slow and unspectacular, this one was a disappointment.

A young princess resists the tradition of being betrothed to a suitor. She is independent minded and wants to pursue her own destiny. She receives an unfortunate spell from a witch and must try to undo it. This is another solid effort in the animated category that combines a compelling storyline with excellent computer animation. The heroine should be someone that little girls will admire and all audiences should find the film quite entertaining. Her beautiful flowing red locks are quite the site to see, and add an element of visual flair to the film. This is a nice animated film for the family to catch.

A young man travels to a small town set in the 1890's, where young children have been dying. He begins seeing images of a deceased woman and looks for a connection with the deaths. The movie contains certain predictable elements of the horror genre, like faces in the window, doors slamming, creepy music, and a rocking chair with no one in it. The late 1800's setting is effective, but this attempt at a combination of a horror film and a murder mystery falls a bit flat as the film is just not very frightening and the investigation into the deaths is only mildly interesting.

Okay, we have another DVD from Slipknot, my favorite heavy metal band. The first disc is nothing more than live scenes from their tour spliced together. A complete waste. The second disc contains three different elements. Footage of the shoot of one of their videos, which is only moderately interesting. The second part is the videos from their latest CD. Outside of Psychosocial, I don't think their last effort was very good. Lastly, there is concert footage from a festival in London. I would have liked this better if it had been concert footage from a show in a relatively small arena, it would have a better feel to it. The good thing is that it was professionally done, and you get some great songs that were not on Disasterpieces. If you have Disasterpieces, I don't know why you need this one, other than to see songs like "Before I Forget" live.

This is a two-disc set. The first one contains the team history. I have been a Bruins fan for many years, but was not a close follower of the team, so I took a lot from this that I did not already know. It was interesting to see the team's history chronicled from its beginning to the present day and to see old footage and the progression of their uniforms over the years.I was surprised that two significant players in team history were not mentioned. Andy Moog, one of the more popular players they had, and Joe Thornton, the high draft pick who never lived up to expectations. These are glaring ommisions. The first disc also has personal stories about the current players, showing them participate in hobbies they like. I would have liked to see more, information about their wife and kids, how they got to where they are.The second disc is a complete waste. It has nothing more than the ceremonies retiring the numbers of some Bruins greats and the ceremony for the final game played at the Boston Garden. I would have liked to see highlights of The Bruins greatest games, or stories focusing on their Stanley Cup runs.Overall the History is interesting, but does omit some significant figures. The rest of it is nothing special. A good watch for a Bruins fan, or any hockey fan, but this could have been better.

A businessman loses his job, and his wife kicks him out of the house, due to his alcoholism. He spends the next several days living in his front yard where he befriends a couple of his neighbors. This is an interesting, but slow-paced film that shows a man who has lost everything and doesn't know how to get his life back together. It takes place almost entirely with him in his front yard, and the highlight is the interactions he has with the people nearby that he did not previously know. This is a movie that is very well-acted, with a cast that is strongly led by the normally dreadful Will Ferrell.

A woman who is unemployed and generally down on her luck tries her hand at bounty hunting, and the primary target turns out to be an ex-lover of hers. She gets involved in mischief and tries to survive while bringing in the bounty. This is an attempt at being clever, funny and hip, but the movie achieves none of those. The storyline is only mildly interesting, and the film has complimentary characters meant to provide light moments, but they are not very funny. I like Katherine Heigl, and she does her best with this, but the material is lacking, and this turns out to be an unrealized attempt at clever comedy.

An animated film based on a Dr. Suess story that tells of a young man who is looking for a live tree to impress a girl that he likes. All the live trees were cut down and the businessman running the town sells fresh air, so he doesn't want the boy to find a tree. It's a little more interesting when you see the movie. Anyhow, this is an average animated effort, with songs that are unspectacular, few funny characters, and a plotline that clearly embraces an agenda of environmentalism. There are a few laughs to be had, and the storyline of promoting the virtues of live greenery certainly has its redeeming values. Overall, this one just does not measure up to some of the fine efforts we have seen in animated films of late.

Thor is based on a lesser-known character from the Marvel Comics line. Thor is undisciplined and therefore his father, the king, is reluctant to see him ascend to the throne. Thor is thrust into another realm, in this case, earth, where he encounters some scientists. A romantic connection ensues between him and the lead scientist, played by Natalie Portman. The visuals in this film are stunning and the 3D effect enhances them. However, this film is more than just a comic superhero movie. There are elements of romance, comedy, and drama present, making this a motion picture that will appeal to all audiences.

A man and a woman who have been close friends for many years see their other friends who are now couples having children. They decide to have a child together, while remaining friends, and not becoming a couple. This invites the predictable dilemma of where their relationship should go. This was quite a good adult drama with comedic elements sprinkled throughout. It presents situations many of us are familiar with, such as searching for the right mate and how children affect a relationship. The two who had the baby together meet people with whom they are happy, but always seem right for each other. The viewer is going to have to discover how this one ends, as I will not be a spoiler. This is a terrific adult oriented dramatic-comedy that will keep you invested in the outcome.

Robert Downey Jr. returns as the superhero with a new foe, the son of his Father's former partner. This leads to the usual exciting finale of the battle between the hero and the villain. The film lacks the sense of discovery that the first Iron Man had, with Tony Stark's Iron Man now a well-known public figure. The introduction of Scarlett Johansson as a karate expert is a welcome addition to the franchise, as her character kicks some serious booty. Overall, disappointing. The first was much better. Seeing Iron Man put the suit together and emerge as a superhero was what made the original exciting. This one is just a below average action film.

The three go on to connect with hunky guys and vacation in luxury. In the end, they may learn something about themselves. This is a harmless film that just about anyone can enjoy. It is predictable, and does not contain any great dramatic moments, but it has an attractive young cast and the movie's target audience of teenage girls will find it entertaining. I would recommend this one if you are in the mood for some lighthearted entertainment.

She comes across another woman living such a life, and also goes about courting a lady that she works with. This is a charming film that depicts the difficulty of a double life and achieving your dreams. Glenn Close is quite convincing as a woman passing herself off as a man and the performances of all the players are outstanding. The Albert Nobbs character is very likeable and I found myself hoping for something positive to come out of the man's/woman's experience. The film is never slow, and every aspect of the movie is very well done. This is a good one to see.

He develops a rapport with a young woman who is a therapist in training. A sometimes depressing and sometimes funny movie, it seems to bring the real-life difficulties for a man diagnosed with a life-threatening disease at such a young age. Starting out a bit iffy, the movie gets better as it goes along and in the end it provides a strong emotional punch.

This is the Judd Apatow formula at its best, with a loveable loser surrounded by three friends all bringing their own method of humor to the film. The movie contains quite a bit of foul language, but mostly in the context of the humor. This is a film that provides many laughs and also enlightens the viewers to the root cause of the attraction that the gorgeous woman feels for the "moodle" as his friends call him. Don't miss this one.

A young man figures it out and decides to take action. This remake of a good 1985 film is actually an improvement of the original. It has been updated for modern day, with excellent visual effects, and 3D. There are some truly scary moments in this one, and the protagonists are likeable people who are easy to root for. Colin Farrell does a creepy turn as the vampire. This is a good horror film without being excessively violent.

In a parody of old Spanish westerns, Will Ferrell stars in an all Spanish-speaking role as a Mexican man whose family is involved with local drug dealers. He takes on the bad guys and seeks to save the life of a beautiful woman in the process. Some scenes in the film were intentionally done in a manner to appear to be amateurish to emulate a low-budget production, and these scenes are good for a few laughs. The movie was not done as a non-stop laugh parody, but is actually played straight more so than expected. I would have liked the movie to be a bit zanier and a clear attempt to parody the genre, but perhaps this would have tread into the territory of silliness. Overall, the movie was okay, and is worth seeing.

This was a very realistic movie that portrays the horrors of the treatment of the Jewish people by the German soldiers, and provides a glimpse of life on the run and the strong human desire to live. The dilemma of the man who is assisting them is apparent, as he must balance his desire to shield the Jews with his priority of protecting the lives of his own wife and child.

During his pursuit of those whom he seeks, there is a hitman after him, the reasons for the hitman being hired being unknown to the audience until the film's conclusion. The men that are being pursued are primarily flawed criminals and the character portrayed by Dwayne Johnson has redeeming qualities, so the audience is not asked to invest any moral assessments, but the mystery of the hired assassin elevates this slightly above your standard revenge movie.

A re-telling of the classic Disney tale of Snow White receives a modern-day make over. The cast of characters is still largely the same, but this time Snow White is a little more independent and able to fend for herself against the evil god-mother. A valiant attempt at updating this tale works well at times, not so well at others. The film certainly looks terrific, with costumes and colorful sets that really bring a magical feel to the film. The humor in it sometimes falls flat as the attempt to be hip does not always work. The best movie's best asset is Lily Collins, who is absolutely delightful as Snow White. I would say that this is a movie that the kids will certainly enjoy and the adults who take them will find it entertaining enough.

Upon locating the lady, a romance ensues, in spite of her jealous ex-husband and the marine's failure to reveal why he has shown up. This is another Nicholas Sparks romance adapted for the big screen, and it is perhaps the best one yet. The film contains all the classic hallmarks of a romance: a handsome hero, a beautiful lady, a villain, and steamy romantic sequences. Men should enjoy the efforts of the film's quiet and strong protagonist to seek out his destiny, while women will like the tale of a strong woman who is struggling with a bullying ex and her feelings for the newcomer. This is a good movie for an evening out with your significant other.

The band's founder used their sex appeal as a tool for success, and the teenage girls were thrust into a life of sex and drugs at such a young age. Tempers flare when conflicts arise between the members, and the band eventually dissolves. The story is very effectively told, with solid performances by the actresses.

It shows the games with a voiceover describing the dramatics of what is happening, the Patriots radio calls, and includes some slow-motion replays. Also incuded are "Belichick Breakdowns", where you can listen to Belichick explain what happened during a particular play. This is an outstanding watch, something I view every so often to relive the Patriots glory days. An improvement over the first one, this is a must-have if you are a Patriots fan.

A young couple decide to infiltrate a cult, and try to secretly film its activities, in order to expose whatever it is the cult members may be up to. They begin to question their skepticism, and wonder if it may be for real. This is a unique film that walks a fine line between documentary style realism and dramatic filmmaking. It has a very realistic feel to it, and is well-scripted and well-acted. The conclusion has everyone involved curious about the validity of the claims of the cult leader, including the audience. If you are looking for a movie that is interesting and unusual, seek this one out.

The story of a young boy whose father died on 9/11. The child finds a mysterious key in his dad's belongings and is determined to find out what the key is for. The film combines his search for the lock with depictions of the boy's difficulty in dealing with the loss of his father. The boy is rather difficult for adults to deal with, and also difficult for the audience to watch. His acting-out is frustrating at times, and makes him more annoying than likeable. I found the movie a bit overlong, although the final minutes of the film are more rewarding than the middle. I would say that this film has a good story to tell, but I am not so sure this one tells it.

A young woman leaves Oklahoma to go to Hollywood in search of her dreams. She works at a club where live bands perform, becoming involved with a young man she meets. A rock superstar named Stacee Jaxx is a focal point of the story, as a difficult rock star that makes life complicated for those around him. This musical features fantastic rock music from the mid to late eighties, and is a non-stop good time featuring creative dance numbers, and surprisingly good vocals from the actors. It is certainly a plot we have all seen before, but good singing and dancing, along with likeable actors, inject life into an old storyline. For a rockin' good time, this is one you don't want to miss.

The race scenes are particularly riveting, as the photography puts the viewer right in the action.

The story of a 1942 Jewish family being evicted from their home in Paris and sent to a camp is interwoven with the plot of a modern-day reporter trying to determine what happened to the little girl in the family. Scenes of the fate of Jewish people at the time are always powerful to watch, with this one being no exception. The anguish of families being separated is realistically portrayed, but their eventual fate is not depicted. The story revolves around the little girl, Sarah, trying to determine the fate of her brother. The other story features the always good Kristin-Scott Thomas, doing a story on the eviction of Jews from Paris, and focusing on understanding the fate that befell Sarah. This is a powerful film that will captivate the viewer.

Journalists at a small Seattle magazine pursue a man who placed an unusual ad seeking a partner for time travel. They are determined to see if he is crazy, or what other motives he may have. Aubrey Plaza is excellent here as an intern who seeks to connect with the man in order to find out what he is up to. The three young journalists are interesting characters and all bring unique personality traits to the film, and the man they are pursuing will keep you guessing if he is overly paranoid or has made an amazing discovery. This is very well-done film, and has likeable characters that all fit quite well into the storyline.

I was a Kiss fan in the 70's, so I go way back. The problem I had with this DVD is that it is mostly all concert footage. I like to see documentary type stuff also. Backstage footage, interviews, background, new insights. You get none of that here. A highlight is Gene Simmons appearing on a 70's talk show in full makeup and costume, and a short story about Kiss visiting a Michigan high school in 1975. Other than that, it is mostly just several hours of concert footage. Good DVD, but not great.

A diverse group of senior citizens all travel to India and end up at the same hotel. Not quite the luxury accommodations that were expected, but they try to make the best of it. They all befriend each other, and also learn to appreciate the locals and the culture. This was a well-scripted movie filled with clever dialogue that kept the audience laughing throughout. Most of the cast is likeable and they all have individual problems and stories that you see them working through. Peppered with a veteran cast of actors, this is film is well-acted, well-written, and is a very entertaining film that is geared toward an adult audience.

True feelings that the friends have for each other begin to surface, and the relationship between the two sisters suffers. This movie has the perfect combination of true-to-life dialogue, funny moments and emotional outbreaks to be a realistic yet riveting look at how these three people deal with perceived betrayal, deception and love. Outstanding acting and a terrific script highlight this one and it is a film that the discriminating filmgoer will quite enjoy.

A young couple meets at a speed dating event and become an item. Their relationship is interrupted by a theft at a home where he works as a security guard. Any further discussion of the film would be a spoiler, so I'll just say that this move will fool you. The viewer doesn't know the reality until the conclusion, and it is a very well done "film noir". The performances are strong, and overall this is really good work.

A former boxer takes the young son he abandoned long ago as he becomes involved in the shadowy world of underground robot boxing. They find an old sparring robot and they are able to get an opportunity to put him in a professional match. The film climaxes with a fight against the mightiest boxing robot in the world. During this adventure, the boxer develops a relationship with the boy that he never knew. This is a delightful film about an underdog trying to achieve the unexpected, and also about a man becoming a father to his growing son. The way the film was scored really adds to the inspirational theme and the characters are more than just backdrops for the fighting. It contains elements that appeal to all demographics. This is a terrific movie that the whole family will enjoy.

This is a good movie for the kids, and adults will find laughs present, though hard to come by. The humor just isn't what it needs to be, but the film does enough to be entertaining. There are a few clever lines uttered that you may miss if not paying attention. The Claymation is fun to see, particularly in 3D. Overall, this is a passable movie for adults and certainly one that the children will enjoy.

After his younger brother is killed in an auto accident, a young man plays catch with his dead sibling in a cemetery each day at the same time. Their bond is threatened by the emergence of a young woman in the man's life, and he has to choose between the two worlds. The film climaxes with a daring attempt to rescue the woman when she is lost sailing. A film that has been unfairly maligned by many critics, this was an engaging drama that pulls the viewer in with a story line that intrigues, and acting that is top notch.

Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.

This is a film about a man whose marriage is collapsing and his family business is failing. He is about to commit suicide when a beaver puppet on his arm talks him out of it. This becomes his primary form of communication with all those around him. I found The Beaver to be quite enthralling with the effect the puppet had on his familial and business relationships remarkable and the performance of Mel Gibson to be outstanding. I just really liked the puppet character, the accent that was voiced for him by Gibson. The drama endured by his oldest son, with whom the relationship is strained, I felt was quite interesting. His tale doesn't distract from the Beaver storyline, but adds to it. The film is a fascinating look at how mental illness can damage a man's life and affect those around him.

Gordon Gecko has been released from prison and gets back into the game, while the strained relationship with his daughter is also an issue. The daughter is involved with a young man who is developing a future with her, but Gordon Gecko's presence presents problems for them. If it sounds like there is a lot going on here, there is, and that is the problem. The film doesn't know if it wants to be a story of family relationships, about the corruption that caused the financial crisis, or a film about deal making and dishonesty. Strong performances from an excellent cast help, but the storyline is a bit unfocused. A cameo by Charlie Sheen is a highlight.

A group of strangers are together on an elevator located in a high-rise building, when the elevator suddenly stops, and strange occurrences begin. An intriguing storyline that provides some thrills, but does not seem to quite live up to its promise. All of the players involved are unlikeable and there is little mystery as to what is occurring. There are some positive aspects to the film because as the lights go out, the audience anticipates what will happen next, but it all ends in an unremarkable conclusion. The film contains some good scares, and is a movie that is unremarkable but does contain some redeeming qualities.

It is 2019 and the planet is ten years into the infection of a virus that has turned humans into vampires. There are only a small number of humans remaining, and the vampires hunt them in order to harvest their blood. A vampire blood scientist who disagrees with the consumption of human blood is trying to find a blood substitute. He encounters a group of people who are hiding out and he teams with them in order to attempt to find a way for the humans to be able to no longer live in fear. This is a very effective science fiction mystery, with engaging players, not simply stock characters to be sacrificed for entertainment. The film is gory at times, but not overly so. This is solid entertainment for moviegoers who are not too sensitive to the sight of blood onscreen.

The story of two children who meet when they become neighbors, and as they grow into their junior high years, they develop a relationship that is at times affectionate, sometimes adversarial. Their families are quite different, and this creates tension between the two familial units. This is a movie that will engage anyone who has had a childhood crush, and features youth experiences that will be familiar to many. Flipped provides some touching moments, along with a few laughs, and will be a welcome diversion from some of the refuse that is being passed off as cinema in today's theaters.

This one features some very solid performances, and the interaction between the characters is the strong suit of the movie. There are some good dance sequences, and storyline is still a good fit for the modern era. Julianne Hough is a rebellious young woman trying to establish her own identity apart from being the preacher's daughter. She is terrific, as well as being absolutely gorgeous. This is a fun movie that I could see again.

A film about a man with mental health issues who has difficulty in social situations, as he engages in a relationship with the personal assistant of his brother. Ben Stiller portrays one of the most annoying and unlikeable characters of recent memory, making the film difficult to watch at times. There is little engaging drama here, but the movie provides a look at a man who is searching for a meaningful relationship in his life. The slow pacing and paucity of dramatic moments make it a hard sell, but Greenberg does have its redeeming qualities in that this is a look at real life, and the issues a socially awkward man has to deal with. Good work also by Greta Gerwig as the female interest.

He then sets out to find out about the man was that had been with his wife, while dealing his difficult children. When complications arise regarding the sale of the family land, due to the wife's affair, the man has an interesting dilemma. That keeps the movie from being simply a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker, and inserts an element of mystery as to how the man will proceed regarding his family's inheritance. This was a realistic look at how a sudden tragedy can impact a family, with some humor sprinkled throughout to keep the audience engaged. This viewer was fully engaged and completely engrossed in the fate of this family. Outstanding performances highlight this one and solidify it as one of the year's top films.

The film is well done, with solid performances, but it is a movie that is a bit slow-paced, and not a lot is happening. The relationships are what the film is about and the onscreen interactions among the players are enough to gain a recommendation.

The local sheriff discovers a downed plane in a nearby river, and suspects that the town's water supply may have been contaminated, but by what? The terror spreads, and the remaining sane inhabitants are left to fend for themselves against not only the sickened residents, but the military personnel who are in town to "clean things up." The film has a lot of good scares, and is violent, but not unnecessarily so. The tension throughout keeps the viewer engrossed, and at times, unsure of whom is "sick", and who is not. The Crazies contains some good scares and is a lot of fun.

This is the third in the Disney series focusing on the planet and its inhabitants, and this is the best one yet. The focus here is on two type of (you guessed it) African cats: A pride of lions, fending off intruding males, and a cheetah, trying to raise her cubs. I am always amazed that the filmmakers are able to successfully photograph these animals and tell such amazing stories about them. The viewer learns things about the cats that were not previously known, and you will see how much their instincts are similar to ours. This is fun for all who attend.

Robert Rodriguez brings to the screen a violent, funny, over-the-top story of a former Mexican Federale, known as Machete, who is hired to assassinate a Texas political figure. The assassination is a set-up, and Machete must find out who is behind it, while at the same time looking at self-preservation. Machete encounters two strong female characters. One is an ICE agent, the other has an operation assisting illegal immigrants, but she poses as a seller of burritos. These two women provide valuable assistance to Machete in his quest to keep himself alive while hunting down the bad guys. The film also contains caricatures of border hawk sheriffs and political figures. The graphic violence is lightened by dark humor that keeps the audience laughing, even while heads are chopped off.

A young man working as a pizza delivery guy is forced to rob a bank when a bomb is strapped to his chest. He enlists the help of a friend, and they must attempt to outwit the bad guys. This is another modern-day comedy, loud, vulgar, and a brand of humor aimed at a young audience. This film appears to have either been poorly scripted, or just filmed from an outline of an idea, with the cast filling in with ad-lib lines. Whichever it may be, the movie does not have enough solid comedic moments. If this had combined a theme of dark humor with clever comedy, it would have been unique, but you have a film with some good moments, but just not enough of them.

He befriends a girl, and together they try to understand the meaning of a mechanical man left behind by the boy's father upon his death. Martin Scorsese has long been a great storyteller and he has now established himself as a master of the 3D effect. The visuals in this film are remarkable, without being a blatant attempt at cashing in on the 3D fad. With good acting all around, the performance that stands out is that of Chloe Moretz, one of the best young actresses in Hollywood. Her subtle expressions throughout add to the charm of this film. The film's intricate storyline may not keep younger children entertained for two hours, but for older kids and adults Hugo is a magical journey of discovery and visual wonders.

A man who works as a journalist is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman in the 60's. He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one.

The team leader undertakes this in order to return to his children, whom he has not seen since being falsely suspected of murdering his wife. This is a complex film that at first appears to have differing illogical sequences, but these are dream sequences, which cannot be fully controlled. The team has varying members of different skill sets, in order to maximize their ability to manipulate the dream environment. This is a visually stunning film, and if the viewer has patience and focus, "Inception" will payoff in the end.

A family gathers to mourn the death of their patriarch. This sounds rather somber until it is revealed that among the mourners are Chris Rock, Tracey Morgan, and Martin Lawrence. With this cast, you would expect to leave the theater in tears from fits of laughter, not lamenting the outlay of $7.00 and an hour and a half of your time. The film is not a total loss, as there are some clever lines, and moments of levity, but with this cast, more was expected. The scenario of a family being blackmailed by a gay midget has comedic appeal, but it just does not come together here.

Not expected to succeed, she attempts to do so by firing the current co-host and bringing in a veteran newsman who believes that the soft stories typical of such shows are beneath him. He feuds with virtually everyone, and the new producer tries to make the show work. The film worked for me, with Rachel MacAdams superbly cast in a role that she is perfectly suited for. Just enough insights are provided into the behind the scenes at a morning show, and the movie is lighthearted enough to keep the audience entertained.

The film has quite a bit of excitement in it, but a significant plot hole. The story line is a bit ludicrous, but the presence of Liam Neeson elevates the film. His depth as an actor brings nuance to a role that could have been an outrageous action hero. The story takes an interesting turn toward the end that explains the confusion of the protagonist. A modest recommendation for a movie that provides a little harmless popcorn fun.

She is not really a girl, but a vampire who has befriended the boy. The girl needs blood to stay alive, creating a need for the man she travels with to take the lives of local residents. This is a very effective horror film that does not deluge the viewer with violence, but engrosses the moviegoer in the developing relationship at the film's core, and the fate of the schoolyard bullies of whom the boy is fearful.Very similar to the original, which is also good.

This thing really stinks. It opens with a man urinating into a toilet. Later, a guy gets drunk and starts puking. Who needs to see that? The live footage was shot by Shawn Crahan onstage. It should have been done professionaly like on Disasterpieces, a much better DVD. No insight is provided here about the band, what their lives are like on the road, etc. Stay away from this.

A hired assassin finds himself to now be a target, and he commences one final mission in Italy. While there, he develops a relationship with local prostitute, and suspects that she may be involved in attempts on his life. The thinking man's action film, this movie's slow pacing saps the thrills out of what could have been a riveting action drama. All is not lost, though, as the movie does just enough to keep the viewer interested, and how the film plays out is an interesting topic of discussion as you leave the theater.

A group of mercenaries are hired by the CIA to remove a businessman from power because of his brutal dominance of a small island nation in the Caribbean where illegal drugs are being manufactured and sold. Plenty of action abounds, along with some graphic scenes of violence in this exciting guy flick. Many stars of modern action fare are present, and seeing them all together is quite a treat for those who enjoy fun summer action films. The requisite humor is present, which lightens the mood of this movie loaded with guns, fistfights, and explosions.

Nick Twist is an awkward teenage boy who moves with his mother and her loser boyfriend into a trailer park. He meets a pretty girl in the neighborhood with whom he falls in love. He creates a fictitious alter ego in order to become someone that he is not so that he can be with the girl he loves. Michael Cera is effective here as the virginal teenager, and there are moments of levity, but the film just is not as funny as it should have been. A fun movie to watch at times, but will be a disappointment for those expecting another "Superbad".

An infamous cat befriends a female, and meets up with an old friend, an egg, sort a Humpty Dumpty. Together, they try to steal a goose who lays golden eggs, for reasons of enrichment, revenge or redemption. The Puss in Boots character is funny and very likeable. This is standard animated fare, but the animation is excellent, and the film is clever, funny and will be fun for the whole family to watch. This one does not rank with the terrific animated movies of recent years, but is certainly one that you should take the kids to see, as everyone will enjoy it.

An old hotel is closing and it may be haunted. The final two staffers are overseeing the departing guests and trying to make contact with the spirits that may be inhabiting the place. The film has its instants of creepiness, but it often relies on the old horror film gimmick of cheap frights, and doesn't provide enough truly scary moments. Moreover, I found the finale unsatisfying, not providing enough of an explanation for what I had just seen. The makings of a good horror movie are present; I just don't think the execution is adequate. This is another low-budget horror effort from Ti West, and this time he disappoints.

This film is a look at the progression of the financial crisis from how it all started, concluding with a look at where we are today. The problems began with a push at deregulation during the Reagan administration, leading to Congressional legislation passed in 1999 which allowed banks to venture into the lucrative world of derivatives. The incestuous relationship between the banking industry and the federal government allowed this crisis to develop and result in no criminal convictions as a result of the misdeeds that were committed.

A film chronicling the story of Aron Ralston, a hiker who became stuck in a remote crevice in a Utah canyon, and had to amputate his arm in order to free himself. The movie focuses fully on the ordeal the hiker had to endure, and the extreme actions he took in order to survive. The film can be difficult to watch at times, but with a terrific performance by James Franco, the viewer is captivated by the struggle of a man clinging to life. The will to live is clearly the driving force behind the hiker's unlikely survival. This is a terrific film.

A young ballerina is selected as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, replacing an aging star that was forcibly retired. She must deal with a difficult director, an overbearing mother, and the jealousies of her fellow dancers. She is being terrorized by one of the other dancers, and has to deal with psychotic episodes. The film succeeds at thrusting the viewer into the world of a woman who is achieving her dream, which turns out to be more of a nightmare. The strange psychotic episodes that she endures blur the line between fantasy and reality for not only her, but the audience. This film is a very strong effort that will capture the audience.

A group of Navy Seals are on a mission to stop an Islamic radical who is working with a drug smuggler to commit terrorist acts. What makes this movie unique is that the Navy Seals are the real deal, not stuntmen and professional actors. Their lack of training in regards to acting is apparent, but that does not detract from the excitement throughout as they engage in realistic combat missions against the bad guys. The film successfully combines the action of the Seals with actors portraying other characters to make a very exciting combat action movie that will stir your patriotic senses.

A lizard gets lost in the desert and finds his way to a small town, populated by various critters, that is desperate for water. He becomes the Sheriff, and must try to become an unlikely hero. A unique animated feature, the movie contains a story line and humor that appeal to an adult audience. The animation is top notch, and there are quite a few clever lines throughout. Johnny Depp has created an endearing character in Rango, whom I found myself rooting for throughout the film. Rango is an animated film that adults can enjoy.

This is a prequel to the Paranormal Activity film, and this one shows how the haunting of Katie and her sister began. Once again, this one is full of tension, and the filmmakers have been able to maintain a level of quality through three films in the trilogy. The first was quite groundbreaking and hasn't been matched, but the second one was also quite good, the third to a lesser extent. There are some cheap scares in this one, but they provide a bit of levity at times. This should be the last of the trilogy, and is worth seeing.
